Jerison With the agreement of author and publisher, Evolution of the Brain and Intelligence, by Harry J. Jerison (New York: Academic Press, 1973), was sent for review, along with a copy of the precis printed below, to a number of scholars. The reviews received are printed here and are followed by a reply by the author. Author's Precis The evidence of the actual evolution of the vertebrate brain is analyzed by reviewing morphological data on endocasts and skeletons of several hundred fossil species and compar- ing these with living species. All of the vertebrate classes, with the exception of the cartilaginous fish (Chondrichth- yes), are included in the fossil sample. Correlated with the evidence of paleogeography, quantitative neuroanat- omy, and psychobiology, this information enables one to reconstruct the effects of major selection pressures on the evolving brain. Vertebrate invasions of various adaptive zones to occupy aquatic, amphibian, terrestrial, aerial, and fossorial niches and the elaboration of sensory, neuro- muscular, and social mechanisms of behavior are all consid- ered. The analysis emphasizes the nature of selection pressures favoring increases in relative brain size and considers how the responses to those pressures (limited almost entirely to birds and mammals) could, in their later stages, be related to the evolution of intelligence. Biological intelligence is considered as a dimension of information-processing capacity. Specifically, it involves the capacity to integrate sets of information from different sense modalities by labeling them with respect to a temporally and spatially identified source in the environ- ment. It also involves the capacity to maintain the label in the face of many variations in the pattern of incoming information. These are fundamental cognitive capacities. They are, respectively, the basis for the construction of "objects" in "time" and "space" and the basis for the maintenance of "constancy" or "perceptual invariance" of objects and background. The real world that we experience is, thus, a construction of the brain, and "reality" for different species will be determined by how their brains work (cf. Von Uexkull 1934). From this perspective, language is better understood as having first evolved because it enhances the image-con- struction capacity of a nervous system, rather than because of its facilitation of communication. With respect to neural organization, the "real world" is a model of a possible world constructed by nervous systems to process the mass of incoming and outgoing information in a consistent way (cf. Craik 1943). It is a trick, a set of "subroutines," as it were, that enables an organism with a large nervous system to handle almost inconceivably large amounts of information, the elements of which are nerve impulses, membrane potentials, and other electrochemical processes in the brain. The view of brain:behavior relations implied by this approach to intelligence is part of the justification for emphasizing data on brain size. Gross brain size is actually a kind of "statistic" which is a remarkably good estimator of neural parameters likely to be correlated with total information-processing capacity. These include the number of cortical neurons, the extent of dendritic arborization, volumes of subcortical nuclei, and many other variables. Brain size can be analyzed into a "general size" component, estimated by the ("allometric") regression of log brain on log body size, and an "encephalization" component, esti- mated by the residual of the regression. This nonrandom "residual" is measured directly by the encephalization quotient EQ for broad faunal comparisons; it should be measured in information-processing units (e.g., "extra neurons") when the comparisons are among closely related species. The brain has been a relatively conservative organ in evolution. The most striking changes in its size were due to the evolution of larger bodies ("Cope's law") and involve the "general size" factor, rather than "encephalization" and the evolution of intelligence. This conservatism with respect to encephalization is particularly manifested among "lower vertebrates" such as bony fish, amphibians, and reptiles (including dinosaurs, flying reptiles, and mammal-like reptiles of the Mesozoic era), all of which have been or are at present at the same level or "grade" of relative brain size, despite their considerable adaptive radiation with respect to specialized parts of the brain and body. Birds and mammals have been "higher" vertebrates with respect to brain size for as long as they are known in the fossil record. The oldest known mammalian endocast is about 150 million years old and is at about the same level of encephalization as that of the living opossum, that is, about four times the size of a brain of a reptile of similar body size. This is evidence for the persistence of niches for small-brained mammals, but it also shows that the earliest mammals had already responded to selection Vol. 16 No. 3 * September 1975 403</page><page sequence="2">pressures for brain enlargement. I associate these with the invasion of nocturnal niches in which normal reptilian vision had to be replaced by audition and olfaction for information about events at a distance. Unlike the visual system, the other sensory systems have to package their information- processing neurons in the brain proper, rather than near the sense organs. The first expansion of the mammalian brain is, thus, viewed as the solution of the packaging problem of where to put the neurons required by these unusual "reptiles" that had to use audition and olfaction instead of vision. But since audition is a sense peculiarly specialized for analyzing temporal sequences of events, the expansion was preadaptive for establishing "time" as a significant encodable dimension of information. There have been interesting and complex trends in brain evolution in mammals. The "Mesozoic" grade of encepha- lization persisted in most groups until the late Eocene (about 40 million years ago), confirming the stability of the role of the brain in mammalian behavior during most of the history of this class. The first evidence of encephalization in the Tertiary period is from early primates, perhaps as many as 60 million years ago. But by the late Eocene there is evidence of encephalization in most groups, even in the insectivores, which are often considered as living "primitive" mammals with respect to their brains. The best and most complete evidence is on the ungulates and carnivores, which showed fairly steady increases and diversifications in brain size during their phyletic histories. In other groups, a particular level seemed to be reached relatively early and was maintained during later evolution. The prosimians had achieved their present levels by the end of the Eocene epoch, and the whales seem to have done the same no later than the early Miocene epoch (about 18 million years ago). I ascribe this encephalization in progressive Tertiary mammals mainly to the reinvasion of diurnal niches that had been opened because of the extinction of diurnal Mesozoic reptiles. Vision reevolved in mammalian species that invaded those niches, but the visual system was no longer mainly retinal. It became corticalized (I propose) to permit the identification ("integration") of information processed by the visual channel with that of the already well-developed auditory and olfactory channels. The rate of evolution of encephalization in hominids is particularly notable. Its rapidity and extent were unique among Plio-Pleistocene vertebrates and must have resulted from extraordinary selection pressures for enlarged brains. It is, nevertheless, possible to analyze these selection pres- sures within the same framework as previous pressures toward brain enlargement. They may be described as permitting better analysis and integration of information about events at a distance. The response to these selection pressures, in the case of the hominids, was to evolve capacities to use linguistic forms-auditory and vocal-to improve the "definition" or "resolution" of labeled objects, actions, time, and space, beyond that available from simpler codes for sensory and perceptual data. The vertebrate brain has evolved to control the normal range of behavior within each vertebrate species. It is most reasonable to identify the brain of lower vertebrates as adapted to control "fixed action patterns" in response to specific patterns of stimulation, with few requirements for plasticity or flexibility. In the higher vertebrates, the birds and mammals, plas- ticity and flexibility are evident in all living species. Yet the birds developed along a different direction, perfecting to an unusual extent the fixed action pattern as the basic behavioral response to environmental requirements. It is really within the mammals that more flexible patterns of behavior have been the rule. The evolution of intelligence occurred mainly within the mammals and only in a casual way in birds, if one defines intelligence as the capacity to learn new response patterns in which sensory information from various modalities is integrated as information about objects in space. These trends reached their most elaborate development in the evolution of the primates, a group of mammals adapted toward adaptability, in which skeletal specialization was minimal and adaptations were more completely deter- mined by the enlargement of the brain and the development of learned behavior mechanisms than in any other verte- brates. The trend culminated in man, and we know it as the capacity for imagery, for language, and for culture. Reviews by R. J. ANDREW School of Biological Sciences, Sussex University, Brighton, Sussex, BNJ 9QG, U.K. 12 xii 74 Jerison has written an idiosyncratic and irritating book, which nevertheless poses a number of questions which have never been given the sort of attention which their impor- tance deserves. It is to be hoped that some of its readers will be provoked into new research on the fossil evidence concerning brain evolution and the factors which have influenced it. At the same time, it is not possible to discuss the problems raised by Jerison without taking issue with a variety of features of the book. The particular examples which I discuss are in no way intended to be exhaustive. The treatment of the evolution of "perceptual worlds" is especially unsatisfactory, particularly since it is presented as crucial to brain evolution. It proceeds largely by assertion. Thus, on p. 18 it is suggested that reptiles were (are?) incapable of relating a "perceived panoramic view" to themselves as a point of reference. The evidence for this appears to be that frogs (and so perhaps reptiles) are incapable of compensating for the rotation of an eye in its socket, whereas human vision copes in time with such an inversion. It is not clear to me exactly what the relevance of such compensation is to the ability to organise a spatial map. Ingle (1970) has shown that frog prey-catching re- sponses take into account distance and direction of prey as well as its type, whilst topographical learning is now established for toads. It may be that something more than this is meant by Jerison: if so, I doubt very much if we have the information yet to allow us to exclude it in Anura, let alone early reptiles. I am even more at a loss to follow the argument that auditory perception differs primitively from visual perception, in that it involves "temporal encod- ing" rather than spatial, and that movement perception is especially a feature of audition. There remains the assertion (which is repeatedly returned to, e.g., pp. 262-63) that ancestral mammals relied so little on vision that they later "reevolved a visual distance sense" (p. 21) and as a result "modeled it after the auditory sense." The special features of the eutherian eye which indicate a period of loss of sauropsidan mechanisms are almost certainly related to small body size and nocturnality (Walls 1963). However, the visual abilities which are suggested need not differ greatly from that of a present-day mouse (with an eye which is not necessarily small relative to body size); it cannot be deduced that vision had ceased to be an important distance sense. More importantly, the visual areas remain based on optic tectum and forebrain areas homologous with those of other vertebrates (Ebbesson 404 C U RRE N T AN TH RO PO LO G Y</page><page sequence="3">Jerison: EVOLUTION OF THE BRAIN AND INTELLIGENCE 1972); it is not clear in what way auditory areas can be said to have been used as a model for the visual system. What is certain is that the therapsid line was very late in linking its ear to airborne rather than earthborne vibration. The heavy therapsid stapes was only lightened and uncoupled from the jaw with the ear ossicle changes which are taken as diagnostic of the origin of the Mammalia. It would seem likely therefore that the therapsid line is one in which vision has been unusually dominant in spatial perception: what the consequences of this might be for the organisation of the mammalian brain can hardly be said at present. A second area of great importance to the book is the differing importance of the different factors leading to increase in brain size. I found it difficult to decide exactly how Jerison evaluated the various ones which he discussed. This was particularly true in the case of the usual allometric increase in brain size with increase in body size. I would have thought that there were two possible explanations of this. One is a largely morphological and developmental one: it may be that the brain grows to a larger size in a larger skull because that is specified in developmental instructions, and because it is best for the brain to fill the endocranial cavity as completely as in smaller ancestors. There are likely to be more neurons as a result, leading to greater redundancy or, in view of recent evidence (e.g., P. Wall, personal communication, 1974), to the loss of synaptic function during development, or the presence of a proportion of functionless neurons. The second possibility is that more neurons are needed to run a larger body. Jerison appears to favour the first alternative, since he argues that larger species have "more extra neurons." However, I cannot see that his deduction from this that larger species are therefore likely to be "specialised in more spectacular ways" necessarily follows; it remains a pure speculation that any additional neurons are freely available for new purposes. In the same section there is confusing mention of the argument (which is clearly correct) that development of new abilities is accompanied by differential brain enlargement. This does not mean, however, that the reverse is true. A third and pervasive feature of the book is the way in which complex phenomena and processes are briefly and inaccurately summed up with no references or only a single one, which is often out of date. Thus (p. 38) it is hardly true that fish brains have shown no major change since the Devonian: one of the most interesting radiations of brain structure, that of the teleosts, had hardly then begun. In what sense has it been shown that an insect such as a bee or solitary wasp lacks a map of its world (p. 161)? Is it really helpful in 1974 to quote Lashley in justification of the theory of mass action? I have said enough to make clear the sort of difficulties which I encountered in my reading. I would like now to consider one or two examples of the interesting new problems raised by Jerison. He has in earlier publications established very clearly the progressive increase during evolution in relative brain size, running in parallel in both ungulates and carnivores. The story is set out here once more clearly and comprehensively. In addition, he now shows that the unrelated but convergent fossil groups of South American herbivores remained persistently small- brained, despite their close resemblance in structure, and so presumably in way of life, to Holarctic ungulates and perissodactyls. This characteristic is confirmed as truly typical of the South American fauna by the fact that it is also shown by the large edentate herbivores. J erison argues that the appearance of creodonts was crucial in causing brain enlargement in archaic Holarctic ungulates, and that this effect can be extrapolated to other herbivore faunas, such as that of South America. This may well be so; it is an important thesis which deserves careful criticism. The first step in Jerison's argument is the assertion that carnivorous arctocyonids were incapable of acting as predators on the archaic ungulates with which they were associated. This left the latter essentially free of predation pressure. I am not competent to evaluate the evidence that arctocyonids were not active predators. Presumably it is partly structural, although some caution is needed in view of the recent demonstration by Kruuk (1972) that hyaenas, which have always been thought of as primarily scavengers, are actually also efficient social hunters of large prey such as zebras. However, I would need very good evidence in order to be convinced of the existence of a continental tetrapod fauna lacking predators for any ex- tended period. The close resemblances in population struc- ture and energy flow which exist in predator/prey relations in typical dinosaur and modern mammal faunas strongly suggest great stability of such relations. It does seem eminently reasonable to argue that the creodonts brought new strategies and abilities to predation, which accelerated the evolution of the brain of archaic ungulates; a second similar step occurred with the appear- ance of modern carnivores. I have some doubts about the details of Jerison's argument that arctocyonid brains were too small to allow them to show "habit patterns appropriate to the predator's role." This seems a dubious conclusion when one considers that crocodiles, lizards, snakes, and even frogs are all efficient predators; Komodo dragons take large land mammals and thereby compete with mammalian predators. What is really needed now is a much more careful reconstruction of the way of life of groups such as the creodonts. This must of necessity be based on general anatomy, and it is an unfortunate weakness of the book under review that it makes so little reference to teeth, skull, and limbs to supplement brain-size data. If we return to the South American fauna, we can now see that the crux of the problem is the failure of any more advanced carnivores to evolve on that continent. Jerison shows that marsupial predators were present and argues that no advance was shown because the marsupials are incapable of increasing relative brain size. This may be so, although I can't see why it should be. My own guess is that the crucial difference between the Holarctic, on the one hand, and South America or Australia, on the other, is the very wide range of habitats, often in consider- able geographical isolation from each other, in the former. As a result, speciation has occurred in a variety of different habitats, followed by cross-invasions, so that, for example, specialisations acquired on the plains or in the north enter and become important in competition in the tropical forest. However, I argued something along similar lines a number of years ago (Andrew 1962) and must therefore confess a prior bias. To many readers, the most fascinating problem attacked by Jerison will be the vast increase in brain size in the primates, particularly in the human line. Here his argu- ments that the abilities to make cross-modal transfer of information and to organise an elaborate map of the environment by which detours and variable routes to a goal could be followed really come into their own. However, they apply (as he points out) just as strongly to other mammalian groups, such as the carnivores. The use of hands for manipulation, with the accompanying coordina- tion of vision and hand movement, may have been an important factor, calling for extra neural machinery. If so, it would be interesting to examine the brains of other mammals with hands, such as the clawless otters. Jerison Vol. 16 No. 3 September 1975 405</page><page sequence="4">is right to emphasise the magnitude of the further changes in brain size which now seem to be likely to be taken as diagnostic of the appearance of the genus Homo. Language and the challenge of a wide range of habitats are stressed by Jerison. Clearly we shall soon be able to pose very much more concrete questions. To take only one example, once we can certainly date the point of laryngeal descent, as suggested by Lieberman and Crelin (197 1), it will be possible to follow the changes in brain size which preceded and followed the origin of language and to associate the whole sequence with ecological changes. However, it is thanks to Jerison that we shall be able to view the brain-size changes in the human line against a comparative background, and thereby hope to establish general principles true for the Hominidae as well as other vertebrates. by CARLETON S. COON 207 Concord St., West Gloucester, Mass. 01930, U.S.A. 27 xi 74 Based on exhaustive research and creative analysis, Evolu- tion of the Brain and Intelligence is a model of painstaking and productive methodology. Instead of bothering with the usual questions about which ape is our closest kin, when our ancestors dropped to the ground and began to walk upright, or who ate what, Jerison sets his evolutionary sights, not on the hull or engines, but on the bridge of the human ship: the control organ, the brain, that has let us be conquerors and destroyers of the Earth. Laying out the casts of the inner surfaces of mammalian brains in order of increasing size alone, he shows that the simplest (which include the earliest) look like beads on a knotted string. As they grow larger the knots disappear and the segments begin to touch each other, and then to join and to overlap, achieving the form of a bisected, truncated globe, the most economical shape for a large organ to be held aloft and balanced on the top of a vertical body. With still further growth, each segment or lobe of either half of the brain's surface loses its pristine smoothness to become folded and wrinkled, until the product looks like an untidy mass of breakfast sausages pressed into a jelly mould. Working with fresh brains, neuroanatomists have charted their lobes for special areas concerned with body motions and the senses of sight, sound, and smell. While it is possible to compare the relative sizes of their areas accurately on the recently dead, this procedure becomes less reliable with endocasts, except where gross categories of animals are compared, down to the level of families. For this reason, and also because in many functions the brain acts as a whole, Jerison has based his study primarily on overall brain weight. To equate these weights in order to compare animals of varying sizes, as from mouse to whale, he has devised a special formula for EQ (encephalization quotient), from which he further derives NC (the ratio of excess neurons), in billions, over and above those needed for automation alone. These excess neurons accommodate the increasing capacities of animals of various lines for learning and, finally, speaking and thinking. (Incidentally, he finds the summit of NC shared by men and dolphins.) Compared to those of reptiles, birds' and mammals' brains have much larger EQs. But among mammals, EQs and NC's both vary considerably between and within families, orders, and smaller taxa, depending on each one's needs. The senses of sight, sound, and smell are developed to meet these varied requirements. Reptiles had and still have color vision, processed in the retina by an elaborate network of neurons. The ancestral mammals lost their color vision by becoming nocturnal; when some of their descendants took to diurnal life, certain kinds of them got color vision back, but in a new way. Because the retinal network had disappeared, their color images were now processed in the cerebral cortex. Thus color vision made motionless predators and some of their prey visible unless perfectly camouflaged, and the ensuing arms race raised the EQ budget of both sides. Sight travels at the speed of light, and its multidimensional images are instantly perceived. While moving at its much slower pace, sound enlarges the eye's field by darting around corners, and its one-dimensional messages, which take time to scan, enhance the information obtained by sight. An animal with superior sight and hearing is more likely to reproduce his kind in open competition with a less privi- leged rival for his special niche and space, and this advantage is reflected in the size of his brain. Like sound, odors can be wafted around corners, or wherever the wind blows, but their effect is more persistent. A scent may cling for days or months, telling the pursuer not only whither, but how long ago, his target animal has gone. It is particularly involved in mating, both in finding partners and in discrimination, which ultimately leads to new speciation. Thus its importance in the evolutionary process far exceeds that of its simple function. Most of Evolution of the Brain and Intelligence is, quite appropriately, devoted to the evolution of the vertebrates in general and the mammals in particular, leaving the consideration of our own genus and species to the end. Before Jerison comes to Homo, he has few endocasts available to represent separate taxa and time-loci, but in the hominid line they become more plentiful. When we reach the discussion of Homo erectus and H. sapiens, I disqualify myself because Jerison uses one of my books as his principal source. But I will bend that rule just far enough to express my gratitude that he too considers Neanderthal to have been a subspecies of H. sapiens. Once he has crossed the Rubicon (a fickle stream) between the parental and the filial species, he signs off, for he has completed his herculean job. What seems vitally impor- tant to our ethnocentric selves today is trivial when compared to the grand panorama that he has portrayed. Wishing him the recognition he deserves, I thank him for having written this monumental book, predictably as immortal as the opera of the 19th century and, to my taste, comparable in our own to D'Arcy Thompson's Growth and Form and Philip Darlington's Zoogeography. No matter what others may later discover about the brain and intelli- gence, I doubt that any can prove Jerison wrong. by EARL W. COUNT 2832 Webster St., Berkeley, Calif. 94705, U.S.A. 28 ii 75 Jerison has presented us laborers on the evolution of man with perhaps the most important monograph yet written on the paleontology of the vertebrate brain. We bioanthropologists know that what is most decisive about man is his superlative brain-power-yet we have contributed notoriously little to its explication. It will not do for us to say that that properly is the job of the neurologist; of course it is, but, with Broca among our forefathers, why hasn't it been ours as well? This chiding-it is intra familia-comes a little late, since now we do include several anthropologists who perform better than an en- cephalometry (which I, too, have performed). Late-but not obsolete. The first and immediate truth, self-evident from preface to index, is that if we would understand the human brain 406 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="5">Terison: EVOLUTION OF THE BRAIN AND INTELLIGENCE as an evolved system, we must understand the vertebrate brain as an evolved system. The brain from ape to man is woefully not enough. What made the mammalian brain in the Triassic made the human brain in the late Tertiary- Quaternary. Undoubtedly, all of us would acknowledge the truth in principle; much of it Jerison has fleshed out. The following summary of what I understand his argu- ment to be is selective; if it does him less than justice, I can only apologise. The phylogenesis of the vertebrates has followed a long and general trend to ever more diverse brains, but of course this is not be understood as crudely as its superficial statement suggests. What Jerison develops from the point is the "principle of proper mass": "the mass of neural tissue controlling a particular function is appropriate to the amount of information processing involved in performing the function" (p.8). From the earliest birds and mammals onward, biological intelligence has increased as an increas- ing and conscious perceptual world has been intercalated between the transformation of sensory information and its conversion into motor information. The principle of proper mass has its rationale in this trend translated into neurones, cytoarchitectonics, and circuitry. And the brain- mass to body-mass relationship becomes henceforth a neurologically meaningful device, when handled by a neu- rologist who can talk about information-processing in dien- cephalic nuclear masses, hippocampal formations, and olfactive, optic, and auditory inputs, as well as what a neocortex is good for. From combinations of cross-reference to the neuroanatomy of extant species and what may be identified in fossil endocasts, something about the ecological niches of palaeo-reptiles, -mammals, and -birds may be reconstructed, particularly in terms of their perceptual worlds. (As suggestive a diagramming of what is involved here as any I have seen is Jerison's fig. 12.2 [p. 265], which brings together the inputs of retina, inner ear, and olfactory epithelium in mammals and passes it all to the nuclei and other formations of the brain.) On such bases and principles, Jerison undertakes interpretations of the adaptive radiations executed anciently by the aquatic and the terrestrial vertebrate taxa; eventually, he turns his beams upon man. The number of discussable topics is endless, and I would not enter upon mere disagreements of private opinion (as, for instance, my unenthusiasm over the Dubois encepha- lisation index, E = kPa, or my belief that Jerison's hypothe- ses of mammalian brain size, which start with a dichotomy of E= EV + EC, etc., while ingenious and suggestive, are not yet purchasable). Instead, I prefer to raise some points of more general principle. They press to be broached, since theoretical biology is today in the throes of consider- able rethinking; and as this goes, so must eventually how we reconstruct and conceptualise human evolution. I take it that Jerison subscribes to the neo-Darwinian approach to evolution and to the "synthetic theory." Since, if so, he has a goodly company, some demurrals may not impress; here they are, nonetheless (some of it said before, in other CA issues, yet repeatable in further context). An evolution of organism is an evolution of system. An evolution of system is an evolution of relations, not of "traits" -even though these latter fragments of a system are all that a paleontology can ever find. A paleontology, moreover, would have its heart excised were it never to be in a position to argue "adaptive radiation." It remains true, nonetheless, that its own evidence is confined to "radiation"; "adaptation" it must borrow from a biology of extant forms. But an adaptation of system reads dif- ferently from an adaptation of a trait. Systems are arguable within a frame of information theory, because information is more than an accumulation of bits that have no relations. Now, Jerison demonstrates over and over that he is quite aware that an evolution of the brain is an evolution of an organic system; hence the strictures that follow are not aimed specifically at him, but at the traditional philosophy of adaptation-through-natural-selection. What we who are holistic in our way of posing questions want to know about the evolution of a system is the transformations it undergoes thereby. And we seek the internal factors, the intrinsic variables with their potential relationships. In this first and intimate sense, a system must harbor its own explication. On such premise, every organism that has ever existed has been "successful," for it has been proven viable by the very fact that it has come into existence at all. Some organisms are more viable than others, along the temporal dimension. No organism remains "successful" for more than a limited time. The definition of "success" in terms of survival until it has reproduced is obviously a rather special, derivative one. The organism that "repro- duces" has not perpetuated its self; for it too "dies"; it has merely lasted long enough to be succeeded by a new (re-)organisation; the "success" is not properly its own, but a continuation of a "lineage," a train of new organisms in time. What we wish. to learn is what makes a particular system continue to do those things that we associate with the definition of living thing. In this, we are frustrated when we are told merely that there must have been powerful "selection pressures" that enhanced the adaptation of what we are studying. "Natural selection" is not an explicatio, but an explicandum. It is a pseudo-explanation. (This by no means is the same thing as denying it the status of natural phenomenon.) This induces a comment on an item which, at first blush, may seem minor; on second thought, it proves not to be so. Following Edinger, Jerison notes (pp. 300, 284), in passing, that in the evolution of the archaic to the progres- sive mammalian brain (e.g., Hyracotherium to Mesohippus) the flexure in the brain stem is of no great moment from the standpoint of an enhancement of capacity for intelli- gence; that, instead, it is related to "efficient packing: a flexured brain is a brain more nearly spherical than is an unflexured one and, therefore, requires less cranium to surround and protect it." He is undoubtedly right about the neurological insignificance. However, it is a habit among rigid selectionists to seek some adaptive rationale for any feature noticed. Is there convincing evidence that this really is why the development not only took place, but survived? If it happened to have an advantage, is there any reason why I may not suppose that it is but a "bonus"? This flexure affords so very little less cranium; can it be proved to be of significant survival value? This is no quibble. Bioanthropologists will recall the bygone day when human-raciologists were appraising brachycephaly as the further evolution beyond the less perfect dolichocephaly, the argument being precisely that it is the more efficient form-that there was somehow more opportunity for a further volumetric increase in brain evolution with a globular one instead of an elongated one. (At that time, a justly famous authority on the evolution of man's skull and its contents told me that the only reason he could think of for the enormous amount of white matter in the cerebral hemispheres was to help keep the head equilibrised on the upright vertebral column. He was himself brachycephalic, by the way. Now, as every wrestler knows, in a match a brachycephal has an advantage over a dolichocephal, since it is very hard to secure and maintain a headlock on him: his head operates on such occasions on what I have sometimes called the "ball-bearing principle." But it is more than doubtful that wrestling has exerted Vol. 16 No. 3 September 1975 407</page><page sequence="6">a selective pressure among Poles to produce a cranial globularity and, incidentally, protect their brains more efficiently in any way.) The devil's-advocate would turn to some more construc- tive suggestion. The brain, after all, is a lump resting on (and secured to) a cranial floor, which is the upper surface of a key bracing structure that is the deep partition and unifier of that strange vertebrate contrivance, the combined container of the rostral end of the central nervous system and the girder structure of the ingestive apparatus. Of these two unrelated complexes, the one that really requires mechanical adjustments is the ingestive one. This central skeleton anchors not only the neck muscles but the ptery- goids and, indirectly, the masseters and temporals and the struts of the bony muzzle. However, there is a more fundamental principle in question. A selectionism that must weigh even the nicety of a brain flexure on its scales is a relic from the days of an 18th-century clockwork universe, a determinism that has managed to survive in a physical and biological world- view that is ever more probabilistic. Jerison does indeed introduce ideas from information theory right from the beginning, when he propounds his principle of proper mass. Would that he had carried the proponence a little farther. The brain, hugely complex system in any verte- brate, in man is incomparably the most complex known to us in the entire universe. It is a very inaccurate and slow computer that secures a tolerable, a viable, modicum of certainty by exploiting redundancy. It fits aptly Quastler's paraphrasing of "Dancoff's Principle" (in Yockey, Platz- mann, and Quastler 1958:190; cited also in CA 15:459-60): "any organism or organisation which has undergone com- petitive evolution will commit as many errors as it can get away with...." As I have said at other times, Nature is more interested in bestowing D-grades than A-grades, in minimum-adequate adjustments, and an organism's capability in compensating by a functional or structural Umweg when it suffers a handicap. "Fitness" receives a definition sui generis, under recognition of this principle. With globality of brain shape not worth pondering even as a spatial accommodation (it is irrelevant to mention the spatial accommodations that the embryonic vertebrate brain must make, for the whole body accommodates itself to limitations of space that no longer obtain postnatally), we are freed to consider von Bonin's remark (1952:143): Wiener (1948) has pointed out the danger of "jamming" the available pathways which may threaten when the cortex becomes large and the connections do not increase proportionately. It may, perhaps with equal justification, be pointed out that too many connections may lead to mutual interference, so that in the end nothing is left but a loud background noise. This may well be the situation in lower forms. Only when signals come in clearly, however, can they be reacted upon selectively. There may be an optimum of connections, and it may be that this optimum is established in the human brain. Perhaps this will serve to explain why the intrinsic factors in the evolution of brain mechanisms and the intelligence they make possible are more interesting than speculations about extrinsic factors. In brief-I learn nothing more about their evolution from the suggestions that maybe proto-man had to compete with or guard against predators on an African savanna, that "selection pressures" must somehow have increased tremendously, that they must have done so or those mechanisms could not have been selected for, in that relatively brief period during the turn of the Pliocene-Pleistocene. For the same reason, it is heartening to read Jerison's judgment (p. 430, where he agrees with Hall, in CA 4:479-94) that tool-making is a rather trivial explication for the evolution of humanised brain and intelligence. The anthropological savanna is wide open to etiological specula- tions which, the more plausible they appear (prima facie), the less they risk challenge and the more readily they become entrenched as dogma. The last state of the dogma arrives when a doubter is summoned to disprove the dogma. A common form of this burden thrust upon him is that, unless he has a better idea, he should remain with the old one. This is a chapter in the sociology of knowledge. Paleanthropology, unlike the physical and chemical sciences (in which experiments are repeatable and verification is hence an ever-available procedure), is not self-correcting. (Oh yes-the physical sciences have their epistemological troubles too; but they are not ours.) Earlier, I mentioned my hesitation at Jerison's "extra neurons" hypothesis. This advertises my limitations, not Jerison's. At long last he exploits it in an explanatory way (p. 397), to essay a metric accounting for a hominid intelligence that pulled ahead of the alloprimates'. Obvious- ly, our thinking about what is one of the very great puzzles in Nature's temporal dimension has come a long way since Keith's Rubicon. Quite as obviously, it has yet even farther to go. Jerison offers his but as a first approximation. I enjoy trotting along beside him while he talks about "adap- tive radiations" without converting "selection pressures" into the subject of an active verb. His final chapter, on the significance of the progressive enlargement of the brain, secures guy-lines from behavior and speech to a brain that has expanded its cognitive control to a point where it can secure them. It is the vision of the chapter, the outcome of what has gone before it, that matters. by ROBERT W. DoTY Center for Brain Research, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester, Rochester, N.Y. 14642, U.S.A. 28 ii 75 My annoyance at the deliberate, explained yet none the less intrusive repetitiousness of Jerison's text, and at the extremely poor quality and labelling of many of the illustra- tions, is far overshadowed by my admiration and respect for his scholarship. This book is an outstanding achievement in neuroscience. Jerison threads his way skillfully through a mass of often fragmentary data, being careful and explicit in his assumptions, always quantifying judiciously and usually conservatively. The success of his procedures is apparent in the overall consistency of the larger patterns he finds written in the phyletic history of the vertebrate brain. This consistency allows a number of fascinating and extraordinary conclusions to be derived from his work. Perhaps my most relevant comment for CA readers is that, as a neurophysiologist, I find Jerison to be respectfully aware of the great gulf of ignorance lying between definable neural mechanisms and simple behaviors. In my opinion he has not strained credibility in any of his assumptions relevant to neurophysiology (or neuroanatomy) and behav- ior. I would object mildly that the "pressure" for birds to evolve brains larger than those of flying reptiles need not derive from the former's initially invading the more complex visual environment of the forest, as compared to the simple, oceanic scene for the latter. Were this the case, one might expect sea birds to have less complex visual systems than sylvan species-an expectation unlikely to be true, but to my knowledge untested. The opossum, however, while having an admittedly well-developed olfactory bulb and inferior colliculus, seems to have the same prepon- derance of visual over auditory cortical representation seen in most mammals (Lende 1963). This neocortical dominance of vision even in this very primitive mammal thus seems directly to belie Jerison's speculation that the early mammals were unique in comparison to reptiles in that they developed 408 C URRE NT AN TH ROPO LO G Y</page><page sequence="7">Jerison: EVOLUTION OF THE BRAIN AND INTELLIGENCE their auditory and olfactory systems "at the expense of" their visual system. My last remark along these lines is simply to emphasize Jerison's note of caution, that brain size or encephalization quotient per se may seriously fail to define behavioral capacity in certain specific instances. Dramatic examples exist with microcephalics. Jensen-Jazbutis (1970) described a brother and sister weighing 45 and 40 kg with brain weights of 385 and 277 g, respectively. While scarcely a Demosthenes, the male nevertheless spoke far more than any ape will ever do, despite a comparable size of brain. Perhaps the same could be said of the sister, who, while generally averbal, displayed a "remarkable command of swear words." Speech is thus clearly a capability even of a severely underdeveloped brain so long as it is hominid; and on this basis even Australopithecus could be a candidate for verbal communication. What I find most challenging in Jerison's book is the decisive contrast he provides for the rate of evolution of the human brain in comparison with that for all other vertebrates. It has long been surmised that man evolved with explosive rapidity. Jerison constructs the parametric background against which this evolution can be perceived as absolutely unique. First, he has shown that the highly diverse behavioral and morphological speciation in fish has occurred apparently without significant variation in relative brain size. Hence brain has no tendency to increment merely as a consequence of genetic drift. This stability is borne out repeatedly in other data from reptiles, birds, and early mammals. What the mammalian brain does respond to in its evolution is predation. This is convincingly shown in Jerison's table 13.2 and figs 13.10, 13.11, and 14.7, where over a period of some 50 x 106 years the ungulates and carnivores gradually develop larger brains, the carni- vores at first "always" exceeding the ungulates. The fact that predation provided the "pressure" responsible for the increasing size of the ungulate brain is dramatically illus- trated by the absence of such increases in the brains of contemporaneous ungulates in South America, which at that time lacked significant predators. The relative size of the ungulate brain doubled in 107 years, roughly 2-3 x 106 generations. The same is true for prosimians evolving into monkeys. Yet in probably less than 100,000 generations Homo habilis or his kin doubled their cerebral endowment to evolve H. erectus. The rate is ten- to thirtyfold faster than anything else Jerison's data and calculations reveal. How can this be explained? Ceta- ceans and proboscidians, despite a slow rate of breeding, have also developed a high encephalization quotient consis- tent with their complex social structure; but so far as is known the rate at which this might have occurred is not exceptional. The fact that technology as well as anatomy in man can remain invariant for 1,000-2,000 generations in the Australian Aborigines (Barbetti and Allen 1972) and Neanderthals (Solecki 1963) does not encourage belief that mere social complexity exerts much evolutionary pressure. Since it is clear from the ungulate-carnivore relation in Jerison's presentation that predation can foster large in- creases in the mammalian encephalization quotient, it seems reasonable to suppose that the same is true for man; and that the explosive rate of this evolution is attributable to the uniqueness in this case, that prey and predator are identical: man. The reason for early man's predation on his own kind can also be inferred. With increase in body size, gestation and immaturity are greatly prolonged. The primate answer to this slowing of reproduction has been to free sexual activity from seasonal cycles. This in turn made hyper- sexuality not only possible, but significantly contributory to reproductive success. It also made male eagerness for available females sufficient that they were sought in mur- derous raids on neighboring bands, a practice evidenced directly throughout recorded history. Two aspects of human social behavior also derive from this evolutionary process. Aggressive reaction to strangers, normally advantageous in limiting the spread of disease (e.g., Greenstein, Doty, and Lowy 1965) as well as in maintaining a feeding range, received further strong ge- netic support. Xenophobia, however, is tempered in male- female relations to the point that extratribal mating is as nearly universal as the incest taboo eschewing the sexually familiar. The evolutionary advantage of sexual marauding remains only so long as the stronger, more cunning, and more inventive individuals differentially survived the process. With the perfection of weapons and social systems, success- ful marauding or defense is grossly uncoupled from indi- vidual craft. Vicious predation, driven by hypersexuality, was highly effective in evolving man's brain. Perhaps recognition of such origins of human mentality and their continuing contribution to human affairs might forestall their ultimate consequences, unsupportable population and the Bomb. by STEPHEN JAY GOULD Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. 02138, U.S.A. 27 ii 75 Any book so comprehensive in its scope and so bold in its assertions is bound to inspire controversy. Jerison will be (indeed has been) attacked on several fronts: some will question his support for Lashley's theory of intelligence; others will use the lack of intraspecific correlation between normal brain size and intelligence in Homo to attack unjustly his interspecific claims for vertebrate classes; still others will question his procedures for estimating brain and body weights of fossils. I regard these criticisms as peripheral to Jerison's major thesis and persist in believing that his book is the most important paleontological document of the decade. Brain size is no perfect measure of what we want to know about mental capacity, but it is all we have as paleontologists to study a vitally important subject. The necessary estimates of brain and body size are not disturbing so long as they do not systematically bias results-an increase in variance only hurts any hypothesis you are trying to prove. The great strepgth of Jerison's book is twofold: (1) He has, for the first time, successfully circumvented the allometric problems involved in assessing brain size independently from its primary correlation with body size. (2) He has provided a systematic survey (much of it based on more than a decade of his own painstaking work) of the history of vertebrate brain size as measured in actual fossils, not as falsely inferred from modern analogues. It is, in fact, remarkable how much can be learned from the study of so crude a measure as endocranial volume. Fascinating tidbit: dinosaurs did not have small brains; their brains were just the "right" size for their enormous bodies. Important finding for evolutionary theory: coevo- lution of carnivores and their herbivorous prey throughout the Tertiary leads to increasing brain size in both groups, but carnivores keep ahead at each stage-a positive feed- back loop must be operating in this "race." Important information for anthropologists: primate brains have been larger than those of all other mammals right from the start-even though the earliest primate endocast is only .68 as big as that of an average modern mammal of the same body size (while an average mammal contemporary with the primate had a brain .20 the size of a modern Vol. 16 No. 3 September 1975 409</page><page sequence="8">mammal's). I have reviewed Jerison's book in extenso else- where (Gould 1975a). by WILLIAM CLYDE KING 1163 Murray Hill Ave., Pittsburgh, Pa. 15217, U.S.A. 28 ii 75 With the exception of one erroneous assumption, Jerison has written a classic work. His documentation of the evolutionary sequence of changes in the brain's size, shape, and strucure (and his inferences about the consequences of these changes for the evolution of the experiential worlds of the groups of animals he considers) from reptile to mammal to primate to man is as exciting as it is exhaustive. His inferences about the nature of the ecological factors involved in the four-stage evolution of the brain from reptile to man seem quite sound. Although he has an epiphenomenalist bias (viewing mind as merely an epiphenomenon of brain-contrary, for ex- ample, to Carl Jung), his book does not suffer from it. In fact, his concern with the evolution of an animal's experience ("perceptual world," in his terms) is refreshing in a field too long dominated by behaviorist, black-box approaches. As Lorenz (1971:334) states, "My teacher Heinroth, the grandfather of objectivized behavioral re- search, was often reproached with the criticism that he treated an animal like a machine with respect to its physio- logical processes. He often used to reply: 'On the contrary, animals are emotional people with very little ability to reason.'" Jerison takes this idea one step further in his discussion of the evolution, in the Mammalia, of "images" and "objects" as parts of the animal's experience. Further, his deductions as to what must have happened in the brain to produce the ability for language in early man (namely a further emphasis on audition and vocalization modeled on the already sophisticated visual system of the primates) appear obviously correct. The erroneous assumption referred to above concerns the locomotor system from which early man evolved. Man did not evolve from a "generalized brachiator," or any other kind of brachiator, as Robinson (1972) has convinc- ingly demonstrated. The assumption of brachiation as our ancestral adaptive type violates the law of evolution that Jerison has so painstakingly observed in the rest of the book. Briefly, this law is Evolution is conservative. Corollaries are (1) new adaptive types (or specializations) are built on previous systems (e.g., knuckle-walking developed "on top of" brachiation to allow gorillas and chimpanzees to move from primarily arboreal econiches to primarily ter- restrial econiches), and (2) once specialized, an evolving group of animals will not regeneralize and then respecialize. These principles are violated by the assumption that a generalized brachiator with an intermembranal index great- er than 1 (a specialized brachiator like the gibbon ap- proaches 1.5) would regeneralize to an index of .95 and then specialize to one of .73 (the index for Homo sapiens). A major anomaly of the generalized-brachiator model has always been the large size of the gluteus maximus in early and modern man. Robinson (1972:80-81) points out that the gluteus maximus is used primarily as an extensor to the thigh, useful in providing power for counteracting gravity (climbing). He suggests that Paranthropus practiced "quadrupedal climbing" (perhaps for escape from predation) in addition to primitive bipedalism while engaging in herbivorous foraging on the ground (p. 98). The evidence indicates the possibility that the hand of Paranthropus was capable of a very powerful grip (consis- tent with this hypothesis), but less capable of manipulative skills than the hand of Australopithecus, Homo africanus in Robinson's terminology (p. 209). I believe that Robinson overstates his case, however, with respect to the alleged fully bipedal, terrestrial biogram of H. africanus. For one thing, the center of gravity's being focussed on the second toe (instead of on the great toe as in H. erectus and H. sapiens) would indicate less than perfect bipedalism. Also, it is difficult to believe that, even in a desiccating ecosystem, an animal as small as H. africanus would not use trees (and therefore "quadrupedal climbing") as an escape from predation. The possibility of some arboreality is further suggested by Robinson's own estimate of the humero-femoral index-approximately .88, midway between H. sapiens (.68-.74) and the pongids (1.01-1.38). This indicates to me even the possibility of some terrestrial quadrupedalism (e.g., if stealth were necessary in capturing a prey object, a quadrupedal stance or gait would aid in concealment). Although data are not available, it is possible to speculate that the intermembranal index for the pro- tohominids was high enough (perhaps .88) to allow for such quadrupedal climbing and/or walking. The above (albeit speculative) model of early hominid locomotion is consistent with the law of conservatism and its corollaries and with Jerison's descriptions of the changes in brain structure and function which led, among other things, to the development of language. Foraging over a wide geographical range, coupled with arboreal retreats (the latter more evident in the paranthropine biogram, the former in the H. africanus), would promote the devel- opment of the auditory-visual integration that Jerison sees as leading to the capacity for "naming" and the further developments he outlines in Chapter 17. There is some evidence that this process began with H. africanus rather than with Paranthropus. The brain of Paranthropus was far less spherical than that of H. africanus, and, as Jerison points out, a spherical brain is more capable of integrative functions than a cylindrical one. It is sad that Jerison was not able to read Robinson's book (published at approximately the same time as his) before writing Chapter 17. I am sure that his inferences would have been superior to my own efforts in this brief review. by MELVIN L. Moss College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 W. 168th St., New York, N.Y. 10032, U.S.A. 3 iii 75 The jacket of this book describes its contents variously as "provocative," "speculative," "unique," and "controver- sial." Obviously this is a book presenting a thesis outside the accepted canons. My background permits me to discuss competently only the anatomical and methodological as- pects of what assuredly is an interesting and detailed presentation. Explicitly no comment is given about the phenomenological aspects of the work. I cannot myself easily bridge the gap between volumetric analysis of portions of the brain and specific aspects of what is to me the still incompletely understood term "intelligence." The production of cranial endocasts, in and of itself, is a valid technique and is exploited fully in this work, as it has been in the past by many workers. Similarly, allometric analysis is a well-established tool in many scientific areas, although the interpretation of the biological signifi- cance of such relationships between the specific growth rates of two measured attributes remains a matter on which the scientific community has not yet reached a consensus. It is fruitless in this review to discuss critically Jerison's assumption that his use of "minimum convex polygons" is "easy to justify both biologically and mathematically." It may indeed be so, but the justification must be uniquely that of the author. Lest this be considered as overly harsh, I hasten to add 410 C U RRE NT AN T H RO PO LO G Y</page><page sequence="9">Jerison: EVOLUTION OF THE BRAIN AND INTELLIGENCE that this is a book that is most welcome, and it is recom- mended to workers in many disciplines, where it can be read and used without necessarily adopting all of the author's conclusions. It masterfully gathers together a vast body of data. Its conclusions are provocative, but probably that is all to the good. by CHARLES R. NOBACK Department of Anatomy, Columbia University, New York, N.Y. 10032, U.S.A. 20 xi 74 Without question, the brain has crucial roles in many skills-e.g., manual, learning, and social-unique to man. The myriad neurobiologic publications of the past have contributed an immense literature which has added a great deal to our understanding of this intricate organ. The comparative neurosciences have added a large number of significant articles which have broadened our conceptu- alization concerning the evolution of the brain. In this context a number of, papers scattered in various sources have concentrated on the fossil evidence. Jerison's book deals primarily with the latter. It is an important book to students of the evolution of man because it conveys the "more general perspective of the history of the brain in vertebrates" in a geologic setting. In addition, it pulls together the paleontological studies, including bibliography, on fossil brains in one volume. Quantitative data-from the so-called brain-body rela- tion-are the prime sources of Jerison's major contribu- tions. The "lower" vertebrates-fish, amphibia, and rep- tiles-have probably always been at the same level of evolution with regard to the relation of brain size to body size. This relation is basically similar in all these classes of vertebrates throughout their phylogenetic history, from the Ordovician period to the present. In contrast, the larger brain size to body size in the large-brain vertebrates is a feature which appeared independently in two classes- birds and mammals-during the Mesozoic age. The en- larged brain-to-body size of the mammals during this age remained at a "Mesozoic level" for 100 million years. This was followed during the Cenozoic age by a further increase in the relative brain size to body size until the present level was attained. The latter took place during the past 50 million years or so. A book of this scope is subject to some valid criticisms; however, these should not obscure the basic thrust of the presentation. Hence I will only mention two: (1) the brain is treated primarily as a black box or statistic, and (2) the word "intelligence" should have been deleted from the title, because scant attention is directed to this topic. by LEONARD RADINSKY Department of Anatomy, University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill. 60637, U.S.A. 6 xi 74 The title of this book is misleading, for it deals with little evidence other than that of brain size. It main contribution is in bringing together in one volume much of what is known about relative brain size in fossil and living verte- brates. Particularly impressive is Jerison's analysis of the evolution of relative brain size over 60 million years in carnivores and ungulates, the only groups for which a good fossil record of brain size is available. One flaw is Jerison's exaggeration of what total brain size can tell us. Citing data on the correlation between brain weight and number of cortical neurons and length of dendritic trees in several species of mammals, he con- cludes (p. 388) that brain size "enables one to make reasonably well-educated guesses about the likely morpho- logical status of the insides of the brain." However, there is much more to neuroanatomy than those two features. Jerison considers brain weight indicative of "total informa- tion processing capacity," which he equates with intelligence, but the only reference he cites to demonstrate the correla- tion between brain size and intelligence is Rensch (1956), who briefly reviewed the results of some tests comparing small and large species and races of various kinds of vertebrates. Intelligence is a complex phenomenon, many aspects of which must be considered, and in the past 20 years a large body of comparative behavioral data has accumulated (see, e.g., Glickman and Sroges 1966). It is a major deficiency in Jerison's argument that he ignores such data, which are the only direct way of testing the relationship between brain size and intelligence. Another flaw is his rejection of other approaches to interpreting brain evolution, such as through data on internal reorganization (see, e.g., Holloway 1968) or form- function correlation based on cortical maps (see, e.g., Radinsky 1968). There is a vast amount of information to be obtained by examining interspecific differences be- tween parts of brains, and it is a pity that Jerison sets up a false dichotomy about the significance of different kinds of data that leads him to ignore or reject virtually all information about brains other than total size. The book suffers from a general lack of methodological rigor. Jerison rarely gives ranges of variation in making comparisons or extrapolations. For example, his index of relative brain size (EQ) for Triconodon, the only Mesozoic mammal discussed, is 0.28, based on a two-step extrapo- lation to estimate body weight (from skull length to body length to body weight). Had Jerison considered the observed range of variation in each of those steps in the living mammals on which the extrapolation is based, he would have come up with possible EQs of 0.11, 0.18, or 0.49 for Triconodon. Again, in Chapter 2 we are told that brains were about one-half as voluminous as endocasts in "several" modern reptiles, and that figure is used to estimate brain size from endocast size in extinct reptiles and amphibians. However, since brain size ranges from 1% to almost 100% of endocranial volume in fishes (examples given by Jerison), it would have been useful to have the number of observa- tions and the observed ranges upon which Jerison based his one-half estimate for reptiles and amphibians. And again, in Chapter 15 Jerison shows lower relative brain size indices (EQs) for some giant Pleistocene mammals compared to one species each of their respective living relatives. Since EQs vary rather widely among related living species, he should instead have given the range of EQs observed among several living relatives. An example of lack of conceptual rigor is in Chapter 11, where Jerison compares olfactory bulb size in some archaic mammals and some modern ones and concludes that olfactory bulbs were not relatively larger in the archaic. However, the archaic sample is composed almost entirely of omnivores and herbivores, while the modern sample consists of six carnivores and one horse. The comparison should have been between species of similar ecological niches. Jerison states that Plesiadapis, the only Paleocene primate for which an uncrushed braincase is known, had a braincase with characteristic primate features, "appropriate to contain a broadened, flattened, and significantly spheroidal brain, as opposed to a cylindrically shaped brain" (p. 368), and that "Plesiadapis seems also to have had the characteristically primate brain shape" (p. 370). However, the braincase of Plesiadapis is different in shape from those of later primates and appears to me to resemble more closely those of some living rodents and marsupials, which do not have primate- Vol. 16 No. 3 September 1975 411</page><page sequence="10">like brains. Unfortunately, we still know nothing about the brains of Paleocene primates. (Szalay [1973] charac- terizes all families of Paleocene primates as having brains distinctly smaller in relative volume than in later primates, but gives no evidence to substantiate that statement.) Jerison quotes with approval Le Gros Clark's statement that pri- mates contrast with all other mammalian orders in the tendency to develop relatively large brains with extensive and richly convoluted cerebral cortex (pp. 372-73). How- ever, as an order, Primates do not differ significantly in those features from carnivorans, cetaceans, probosci- deans, artiodactyls, and perissodactyls. In summary, the main contribution of this book is in reviewing data on the evolution of relative brain size in vertebrates. That contribution is diminished by the careless handling of data, which in some cases results in unwarranted conclusions and in others gives the impression of greater accuracy than the data warrant. Some of Jerison's specula- tions about the significance of brain size may prove valuable in stimulating others to investigate and collect relevant data; other speculations and conclusions I fear may have a negative impact in providing false or biased assumptions from which future workers will operate. by S. L. WASHBURN Department of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley, Calif. 94720, U.S.A. 13 xii 74 This book represents a major synthesis which will be useful for many years to come. The concept of "extra neurons" is useful and adds greatly to the understanding of encepha- lization. I found the discussion of the progressive evolution of the brain in ungulates and carnivores particularly inter- esting. It shows how much can be accomplished when there is an adequate fossil record. Clearly, the method should be judged from the data on the best-known groups, and not from the primates, although they are of particular interest to our species. The following comments are minor, but, perhaps, of some concern to anthropologists. Jerison gives a very useful view of brain evolution and defends the use of brain weight, although the brain is composed of parts with varying functions. But body weight is also complex, and a consider- able part of body weight may have little connection with the evolution of the brain. For example, how much of the difference in encephalization between ungulates and carnivores is due to differences in the viscera and their contents? Surely a large part of the apparent difference in encephalization between langurs and macaques is the result of the characteristics of the langur stomach and the fact that leaves must remain in the stomach while ferment- ing. Jerison correctly does not use the weight of grossly obese captive gorillas-but is the weight of the very large, food-filled viscera of the wild-shot gorilla any more relevant to the evolution of the brain? I have an uneasy feeling that, in the detailed comparison of closely related forms, both brain weight and body weight will need to be divided into their components. A special problem arises in the calculation of "extra neurons" in the case of man. Over the last few years it has become clear that the two sides of the human brain have different, complementary functions. As Jerison points out, language was the first asymmetrical function to be recognized. Because of the asymmetrical functions of the two hemispheres, the functional differences between ape and man may be far greater than might be expected from the calculations. If languages of the kind we know today have an antiquity of some 40,000 years, and if the evolution of language is correlated with lateralization in the hemi- spheres, then some fossil men might have the same-sized brains as modern man-but their brains would, by no means, be functionally equivalent. Obviously, the general utility of the encephalization quotient and the additive "extra neuron" hypothesis is not affected by the complications which may arise in applying it to the case of man. Jerison has succeeded in bringing order to a remarkable range of data, and he has laid a foundation for all future studies of the evolution of the brain and intelligence. by WALLY WELKER Department of Neurophysiology, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison, Wis. 53706, U.S.A. 25 ii 75 Jerison has produced a comprehensive compilation and review of data on brain-size trends in extinct and living vertebrates. The data are well chosen, and the quantitative analyses are appropriate to the description of evolutionary changes in brain-size/body-size relationships. The hypoth- eses proposed as to increases in brain size are well supported and consistent with neurobiological findings in living ani- mals. Though they are general rather than detailed, they provide guidelines within which more specific ones can be formulated. Assumptions are always explicitly labeled as such, and alternative hypotheses are carefully considered. Speculations as to sequences of selective pressures and evolving behavioral, perceptual, and cognitive capacities are thoughtfully documented and justified; they provide a reasonable and valuable account of the natural history of brain evolution in vertebrates and its significance for the evolution of behavior and mentation. This book, a culmination of many years of research, is the first comprehensive review to provide a well-docu- mented time dimension for vertebrate brain evolution. It is also the first to synthesize a great variety of data and hypotheses from the fossil record and from comparative studies of living vertebrates, and in so doing it brings this mass of data new vitality and meaning. A highly creative, fertile, and stimulating work, it offers workers in all sub- disciplines of neurobiology a sophisticated and scientifically respectable evolutionary perspective. by JAN WIND Antropogenetisch Instituut, Vrije Universiteit, Van der Boechorststraat 7, Amsterdam-1011, the Netherlands. 2 I 75 For several reasons I consider this remarkable book very valuable. Jerison has performed an admirable task by synthesizing so many data from so many sciences about such a difficult subject. As far as I am able to judge, his overall approach is from a scientific point of view quite satisfactory, incorporating evidence from paleontology, evolutionary biology, neurology, mathematics, anthro- pology, zoology, psychology, etc. For me as a surgeon (ear-nose-throat)-and my opinion may be representative of those of many other physicians-the human brain and its functioning have always been somewhat mysterious and elusive, being discussed only in vague, phenomenological, and abstract terms. This book has certainly contributed to diminishing that feeling by demythologizing the whole topic and treating the cerebrum like any other organ that is accessible for a biological and clinical approach. My intuitive feeling of an antinomy present in thinking about thinking has largely disappeared in reading this work. Jerison's book is indeed thought(about thoughts)-provoking by raising new issues and by indicating avenues for further research. This explains why I have some remarks and questions. First, I think the title would have gained somewhat in clarity by adding the word "vertebrate," as this more clearly 412 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">Jerison: EVOLUTION OF THE BRAIN AND INTELLIGENCE covers the book's contents. Second, I wondered whether Jerison's definition of intelligence (also rendered in the Author's Precis), though undoubtedly of heuristic value, might be slightly too reductionistic and too anthropomor- phic a concept to be applied to every organism. For readers not familiar with comparative psychology, this point could have been elaborated somewhat further. A third, probably more important, remark concerns the author's basic ap- proach towards solving the intriguing question mentioned in the book's title: his evolutionary and comparative analyses are essentially quantitative rather than qualitative, and morphological rather than functional. He usually jumps from gross morphology, i.e., brain size and shape, directly to conclusions about functions without really taking into account the mediating biochemical and biophysical proc- esses. For instance, I wondered (a) whether there is an allometric relationship between brain size and oxygenation, and between the degree of corticalization and oxygenation, (b) whether oxygen need is greater in homoiothermic brains than in poikilothermic ones, and (c) whether evolutionary changes in the biochemical processes of the brain may have contributed to the evolution of intelligence. These questions remain unanswered. I have even been unable to find the word "oxygenation" in this volume. Admittedly, there is not, and probably never will be, any such science as paleoneurobiochemistry. This does not exclude, however, the possibility of obtaining indications about fossil behavior other than those provided by osteological evidence such as brain casts. There is evidence from comparative neuro- biochemistry and neurobiophysics, and there are various paleo-sciences. This approach may have come to grief in one of Jerison's main arguments-that the Tertiary mammals came out of their nocturnal niches because of the Ruling Reptiles' becoming extinct. Jerison may have fallen into a trap common in evolutionary speculations, namely into what could be called the chicken-egg trap. If a causal relationship is assumed between two seemingly synchronous evolution- ary phenomena like the radiation of these early mammals and the extinction of these reptiles, then it should be asked which of the two came first and why. Accordingly, the possibility of a relatonship in both directions rather than only in one should be considered. I think that in the example mentioned there are indeed reasons to assume a causal relationship in the other direction-i.e., that the reptiles became extinct because of the mammalian radiation. My assumption is as follows: it was homoiothermy which pro- vided the early mammals with a selective advantage relative to the reptiles, by allowing them greater mobility at all times and by permitting the evolution of a larger brain size and maybe of relatively more neocortical tissue. The resulting interfering food cycles may have caused reptilian extinction. Probably homoiothermy could only evolve after atmospheric oxygen levels had increased. The enigmatically long time it took for the mammal-like reptiles to evolve into true mammals, 150 x 106 years, indicates that some new selective pressure had come into operation, and I suggest (Wind 1975) that it was an increase in atmospheric oxygen. This suggestion is in agreement with paleoclima- tology, and the "sudden" radiation not only of mammals but also of the -homoiothermic-birds seems to affirm such dating. Another issue which I had expected to be discussed in the book at greater length is the evolution of cerebral language function, and especially the differences between man and apes in this respect. Admittedly, because of my personal interest I may be biased on this topic, and, to be sure, Jerison provides some fresh ideas concerning language emergence, e.g., by proposing that it was cognitive imagery rather than communication which was the original function of language. However, of the work of "comparative linguistics" he only mentions Premack's contribution, and not that of the Hayeses (1951), the Gardners (1969), Fouts (1972), and Rensch (1968). (The work of Rumbaugh, Gill, and von Glasersfeld [1973] and Fouts [1973] may have been published too recently to have been incorporated in the book.) In addition, I was very eager to hear the opinion of an authority like Jerison about the attempts to bridge the gap between ape and human language behavior (Ploog and Melnechuk 1971) and about Geschwind's (1964) cross- modality concept of language emergence. Of the few typographical errors I mention two: on p. 28 reference is made to fig. 5.10, which should be 5.9; the scale on p. 349 is rendered in mm, whereas it should be cm. In conclusion, my remarks are not meant as depreciating, but only as suggestions for a second edition (which this volume certainly deserves) and contributions to the discus- sion of the fascinating topic which Jerison has so ably treated. Reply by HARRY J. JERISON Department of Psychiatry, UCLA School of Medicine, 760 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, Calif. 90024, U.S.A. 20 iii 75 I appreciate very much the enthusiastic response of most of the reviewers and the detailed statements by those less enchanted with my effort. I have tried here to respond to as many specific statements as possible, though in writing this reply in the form of an essay I have probably overlooked some important points. Wind mentions two typographic errors. I wish there were so few. I have noted some 50 errata and corrigenda, the most important of which I can list on a single sheet. I will be happy to mail copies of the list to interested readers. (Stamped self-addressed envelopes will be appreciated from readers in the U.S.A.) The reply is divided into sections on (1) intelligence, (2) evolution, and (3) methodological issues. These are followed by a brief concluding statement. INTELLIGENCE One of my objectives was to clarify the concept of intelli- gence (or mind) by considering it in a biological context. I must, therefore, reject Noback's suggestion that "intelli- gence" be removed from the title, not so much because I am happy with the way I treated it as because the concept has a central place in the book as the basic selection pressure toward enlargement of the brain. The real problem is to define it biologically, independently of the fact of brain enlargement (which is sufficient to define it for formal purposes-see below). It is interesting that among the reviewers, only those whose scientific work has not included specific probes into the analysis of animal or human intelligence comment on the appropriateness or adequacy of this aspect of the book. This says less about the reviewers than about the present state of "intelligence." Welker, Doty, Andrew, and the anthropologists in this group know the difficulties of definition and probably appreciate that I used the concept in a reasonably sophisticated way. Radinsky's suggestion that "a large body of comparative data has accumulated" Vol. 16 No. 3 September 1975 413</page><page sequence="12">and his citation of Glickman and Sroges (1966) are, I am afraid, the unsophisticated reading by a very good paleon- tologist of a psychological and ethological literature that is all too inadequate. Glickman and Sroges (1966), for example, studied "curiosity" or "exploratory behavior" in zoo animals and decided (quite correctly) that their rather crude tests measured behavior that was determined more by a species's natural habitat than by anything that could be thought of as intelligence. Their work followed proce- dures developed by Welker (1961), and his review does not suggest that he would join Radinsky in his criticism. Examples on rats and monkeys may give a sense of how hard it is to define intelligence in animals despite our strong intuitions that this is a valid dimension for analysis. It is well known that albino laboratory rats perform significantly better on "curiosity" tests than do wild rats. Barnett (1963) cites this as an example of stupidity rather than intelligence in laboratory mutations (while also trying to suggest the difficulty of defining stupidity for animals), because a wild rat that did much exploring of a novel environment would soon be a meal for one of its natural predators. Spider monkeys seem to be unusually encephalized, at least ac- cording to my NC index as shown in table 16.3 of my book, but they are notoriously incompetent in many labora- tory tasks. Glickman and Sroges found them somewhat lower than Old World monkeys on their measures of curiosity, and Parker (1974) finds them lower on a scale of behavioral diversity than even the prosimians; they were the poorest of the ten species he studied. In my experience with many animals in tasks requiring attentiveness, however, I have found the "genius" among my animals to be a spider monkey (Jerison 1965, 1967). The task was arranged to be comparable to a well-stan- dardized human performance task intrinsic to which is the requirement to be attentive when and only when it is rewarding to be attentive. In human subjects this is arranged by the verbal instructions, but in animals it requires a lengthy training procedure. As a result of the procedure a variety of strategies is open to the animals, and relatively few animals adopt a strategy similar to the human one. This is not an indictment of the intelligence of animals. Rather, it is a statement about the way in which costs are balanced against benefits for different species. In our case, we usually avoid the boredom that is charac- teristic of attention-demanding tasks. An alternate strategy is to be alert and responsive at all times. Most animals in my experience (rats, cats, squirrel monkeys, macaques) adopt the alternate strategy. My spider monkey, on the other hand, learned to enter a cage, sleep for about two hours when noncritical signals were arriving, and wake up shortly before the first critical signal in order to respond to that signal for the appropriate reinforcement. This it learned on its own, without special training. Its behavior was unique in other ways in that it became adapted to unusual quarters and inhibited irrelevant behavior. In short, it was economizing its movements-which would explain low scores on tests of behavioral diversity or exploration. It would be tempting to treat this as evidence of intelli- gence of a higher order in spider monkeys, consistent with their high Nc. But like Welker, or Glickman and Sroges, I prefer to describe the behavior as an interaction of the spider monkey's normal repertoire with unusual situational demands and the unique history of this particular animal's experience with its trainer, the equipment, and the labora- tory. Much more experience with any experimental design is needed to use a single design as a model of intelligent behavior. Before we can properly measure biological intelligence, we must have a theory of intelligence that encompasses human and animal behavior. No significant theory has been proposed thus far, and the limited discussion of the litera- ture in my book (p. 24) has citations that would lead a reader to the important recent references. One contribution of the book is to suggest dimensions of behavior that are relevant for a theory of intelligence. The problem as I see it is to determine when cognitive imagery is used in behaviors that could occur with and without such imagery. Tool making and using is one such category, and, as Count correctly states, I consider this a rather trivial category for explaining human evolution. If one could explore the cognitive dimension of tool making, however, it would no longer be an entirely trivial behavior. It would be important not because it would show something about the evolution of tool using but because it might suggest how cognitive capacities evolved. In my book I use the concept of intelligence as part of a formal analysis, and I have outlined for myself the logic of the approach. A look at that outline may help clarify the way the concept is used. The logic begins with the hypothesis, derived from Lashley's assertion as quoted on the first page of the book (see Beach et al. 1960:463), that the undefined character "biological intelligence" is measured by EQ. Hypothesis 1. Intelligence is measured by EQ. The second hypothesis is: Hypothesis 2. Intelligence evolved (was subject to natural selection). And this implies: Theorem 1. EQ evolved. A long set of theoretical statements derived from the formal structure of the theory of evolution is omitted here; these tell us what to expect about a trait that evolved. Two important theorems can then be stated which apply identi- cally to intelligence or EQ: Theorem 2. EQ in living species occurs to different extents, and there is an orderly dispersion of EQ among species. (This assumes that selection pres- sures for intelligence are different in different niches.) Theorem 3. In the evolutionary history of groups of species with high EQ there was progressive increase and diversification of EQ. Much of the quantitative analysis in the book can be related to this formal approach. Here we see that Lashley presented no real theory of intelligence (note Gould's comment); he merely used his intuition to offer a defini- tion of sorts which could be stated as Hypothesis 1. Yet in the tests of the implications of this and the second hypothesis we do have elements for a better understanding of intelligence. Theorems 2 and 3 are testable as experi- mental hypotheses. Both were tested and supported to a very high degree of confidence by the evidence; the results are summarized in Appendix II of the book. This enables us to return to our two hypotheses, which we may now consider to be supported by the evidence. The logical arrows do not necessarily point both ways, however, and I have not shown (or attempted to show) that Theorems 2 and 3 could not have been derived from other premises. The approach could be challenged, but not falsified, if that were shown; nobody had done that, to my knowledge. The approach would have been falsified, that is, proven 414 C U RRE N T A N T H ROPOLO G Y</page><page sequence="13">Jerison: EVOLUTION OF THE BRAIN AND INTELLIGENCE untrue, if the analysis in Appendix II had shown no differences in the distributions of EQ among the various samples of living and fossil mammals. The most elegant support for Theorem 3, which is at the heart of the book, came from the analysis of the evolution of encephalization in carnivores and ungulates, as several of the reviewers point out explicitly without necessarily accepting the analysis that led to this theorem (Andrew, Doty, Gould, Radinsky, Washburn). Here the relation between theory and "experiment" is quite clear, because the theory directed both the selection and the analysis of data. I particularly enjoy the paradoxical form of the logic of this approach. As a psychologist I am, of course, interested in understanding intelligence (including its evolution and natural history). Yet the approach has been to make a quick jump from intelligence to morphology (not the other way around-which would have been even more perplexing, as Moss notes), and the jump was made by accepting Lashley's statement as a testable hypothesis. My contribution was to follow through as completely as I could in the analysis of the evolutionary implications for the morphological trait (EQ) as if it were "intelligence." These turned out to be consistent with one's expectations if the trait behaved as "intelligence" would behave if it were an evolving biological trait, and this led back to the affirmation that the information gained about the history of EQ was also information about the history of intelligence. The unusual logic was to use hypotheses that related the evolution of intelligence to morphology, and then transfer the inferences from morphology back to intelligence as the evolving trait. As long as the logic of this procedure is appreciated, it is unlikely to lead to idle or absurd conclusions. Rather, it provides a new perspective on the evolution of intelligence, which can then be compared with (and tested against) the implications of other perspectives. The concept of perceptual worlds. The formal approach provides the bare bones for the analysis of intelligence as a biological phenomenon. These can be fleshed out by an appropriate amalgam of speculation, analysis of behav- ior, and considerations of the biological significance of human consciousness or awareness. Although he challenges my exposition of the concept of perceptual worlds, Andrew is fully aware of the significance of this part of the analysis, especially for primate evolution. I am pleased with the approval of this view that I read in Count's elegant prose, in Welker's concise evaluation, and in the explicit agreement expressed by King. I would like to reassure Wind that the approach is neither reductionist nor anthropomorphic in the negative sense of these terms. This may become clearer if I respond in detail to Andrew's criticisms of my discussion of perceptual worlds. I should say, however, that there are no firm answers that I or anyone else can offer, and the most desirable outcome of this discussion is a better appreciation of the questions that have to be asked. I have summarized my view of biological intelligence in the second, third, and fourth paragraphs of my precis. The measure of intelligence in the between-species sense would be of the quality of the perceptual world typically created by the brain of a particular species. This quality would involve the complexity of events that could be handled at a particular time and the extent to which a world is created and maintained which is consistent with the requirements of life and reproduction. I introduce the concept of perceptual worlds with von Uexkiull's (1934) idea of Urnweltas a species-specific percep- tual world. I immediately add to that Craik's (1943) concept of thought and explanation as the construction (by the mind) of a model system (usually mechanical for those brought up in Western culture) in which cause and effect are related in the same way that they appear to be in the thought-system or in whatever system we seek to understand and explain. This is not the same concept as Umwelt in biology (e.g., Wilson, 1970:197), which can be applied to the "world" as "perceived" by any animal and is, essentially, a catalogue of sensory acuities interpreted as if these were sensory capacities of a human observer. The crucial difference is that my concept of "perceptual world" implies a kind of consciousness, or at least an intervening process that transforms stimulus-information into action. Andrew, and others, should realize, first, that I am presenting a new analysis, not reviewing an old concept. I am also suggesting that a model is really constructed by the brain to make sense of an enormously complex neural input and to produce the equally complex neural output that we see as simple or complex behavior. Even the simplest of human or animal acts (such as moving the eyes to follow a target) may involve (in mammals) millions of identifiable events in the nervous system. These many events must be broken down into manageable "chunks" (Simon 1974), which, in this case, are the elements and dimensions of a perceptual world: space, time, objects, etc. Another way to think of the concept is to recall Tolman's (1935) discussion of the role of "intervening variables" and "hypothetical constructs" in the development of a scientific theory. His point was that in writing the equations of the theory to relate systems of responses to systems of stimuli, it is often necessary to assume a set of constructs that have some unusual properties and that also have roles in the equations. Rather than write that a response is some function of the stimulus, one writes that it is some function of the construct, as determined (in turn, and in part) by the stimulus. We can think of the brain as a theory-building machine that creates a "perceptual world" as a hypothetical construct in order to do an otherwise impossible job in transforming information. In this sense King is right in saying that I view mind as an epiphenomenon of brain, although it might be more accurate to say that I see it as a phenomenon of brain which occurs when the brain's capacity to handle information becomes greater than some (perhaps small) specified amount. Given this analysis, it may be clearer why the fly-catching response of the frog (Ingle 1970) and topographical "learn- ing" in the toad (I suppose that Andrew has Ewert's [1974] work in mind) do not imply the formation of perceptual worlds in the sense that I have just described. There is nothing in that work that implies the requirement of anything beyond relatively simple stimulus-analyzers that would control the animal's response. The most dramatic examples remain those cited in my book, in which no correction is ever made by a frog for the inversion of its visual field by the rotation of its eyeball in its socket. Humans do make the correction to long-term inversion of the retinal visual field and report it as a righting of the world of their immediate experience. The more recent citations provide other evidence for approximately the same phenomenon. Ewert, for example, analyzes most of the complex neuronal circuit for visually guided behavior in the toad, including eye and brain. Although he uses familiar meta- phors of human experience to describe objects as "predator" and "prey," he shows quite clearly that the analysis of topography by the toad's eye and brain can be described in exactly the same terms as the discrimination of signals by computers and other machines. For example, he writes (p. 41): "The basic filtering process for prey-enemy dif- Vol. 16 No. 3 September 1975 415</page><page sequence="14">ferentiation can be conceived of as passage through a series of 'window discriminators,' each stage of which analyzes a particular aspect of the object in question." (The term "window discriminator" is common in descriptions by phys- iologists of one method used in the computer sorting of electrophysiological responses according to voltage, fre- quency, and other characteristics.) Ewert continues (p. 42): "If the filtering process described above has identified ['sorted'] the object as prey, then the appropriate neuronal system is activated. . . If an experimental prey object is removed at the instant when it is fixated by the toad, the entire normal prey-catching routine proceeds. The toad snaps, gulps, and wipes its mouth, in spite of the 'situational vacuum.' " I interpret this work, Ingle's (1970) work on frogs (cited by Andrew), and especially the work that I cite in my book on displaced and rotated visual fields as evidence that the frog's and toad's brains do not construct model "real worlds" to intervene between stimulus and response, but act, instead, as complex reflex machines. The human brain almost certainly also has neuronal systems that analyze information in ways comparable to the "window discrimi- nators" discussed by Ewert, because that is the way neural information tends to be analyzed. The results of such analysis can be in the form of summary information about what we consciously experience as edges, extents, and directions of motion. But these summaries can be given very abstract codes. It is only if they are translated into objects, which maintain their identity regardless of their motion or the point from which they are viewed, that one must begin to discuss perceptual worlds as I used the term. Brain and intelligence. There remains the problem of showing why Lashley's jump from intelligence to encepha- lization turned out to be scientifically respectable. From the naturalistic analysis of perceptual worlds just presented, and from the definition of intelligence and encephalization in the precis, it follows that intelligence requires the in- tegration of information from many sense modalities (in- cluding feedback from motor systems). According to my theory, it is this which results in the construction of perceptual worlds as models of possible realities. Radinsky points out that one normally looks at the brain as comprised of many parts in which there is a form-function correlation. He is emphasizing localization of function. I must argue, on physiological grounds, that it would be impossible to localize the function of "creating of perceptual worlds" in any useful way. One might exclude some obvious reflex centers in the midbrain and hindbrain, but even this is hazardous in view of the extent to which the parts of the waking brain interact. There must be some kind of "mass action." I do not quote Lashley to justify the theory of mass action, as Andrew states; rather, I summarize the concept "as currently conceived" (p. 9) and merely cite Lashley because his work is historically associated with the doctrine. The doctrine is appropriate for the analysis of intelligence, in particular as I state it (p. 9): "Complex behavioral functions tend to be governed by an extensive and diffuse network of neural structures." I doubt that any neuroscientist would challenge that statement (Jerison 1975). From the point of view of the evolution of intelligence, one must seek measures that involve the whole brain. It is true that the whole brain does not actually function as a unit to produce the perceptual worlds of animals, the world of human conscious experience, or the world of the unconscious defined psychoanalytically. Each of these "perceptual worlds" (all would fit my definition) is created by the brain as a whole in the sense that the "wiring diagram" for this function of the brain must be a very elaborate and extensive one. The measure of encephalization, such as EQ or NC, does not include the whole brain, although in a highly encepha- lized creature like man it includes a very large fraction of the brain-something of the order of 85% according to the formila for NC that I presented in my book, but probably significantly less than that if one used a more complete theory of brain size to derive Nc (Jerison, unpub- lished). The important thing is not the fraction, however; it is the fact that the encephalized fraction of the brain is not described as localized. In discussing the quantitative analysis fundamental to the concept of encephalization, I point out that when the parameter N for total number of neurons (of which NC is one fraction) is computed "the sampling of brain cells could be random with respect to location, providing only that large numbers were sampled" (p. 71). The idea was to specify how much neural tissue is available for the job of creating perceptual worlds, that is, for "intelligence," not to say where the neurons are. It is appropriate to respond specifically here to Radinsky's criticisms about my use of brain size, my "exaggeration of what total brain size tells us," and my ignoring approaches to brain evolution that emphasize internal reorganization (Holloway 1968) or use of the localization of function analysis based on the morphology of the fissural patterns of endocasts (Radinsky 1968, etc). I do not exaggerate what total brain size tells us, but outline the information in some detail in my Chapter 3. Other reviewers do not make an issue of the "false dichotomy" that Radinsky sees in my analysis, and the reason, I suggest, is that the "dichotomy" is not false. One gets different kinds of data from gross size and from detailed analysis. These should not be contradictory. I discuss all of these issues elsewhere (Jerison 1975) and will only indicate here where I see reorganization and localization as fitting into my analysis. I discuss internal reorganization in statistical terms by reviewing various multivariate analyses of the relation of organization to gross brain size (pp. 72-77). Holloway's (1968) work on internal reorganization, cited by Radinsky, is also cited in my book, but it offers only naive speculations about the evolution of organization, based on the data of quantitative comparative neurology, without analyzing the data in a useful way. I discuss Radinsky's work on localization of function from the data on endocasts at many points and indicate there my reservations about his inter- pretations, although I also report his interpretations (pp. 295-98, 365-72). In addition, I present brief morphological analyses of many of the endocasts for which there are good analyses in the literature and cite the relevant works of morphologically inclined paleoneurologists such as Deschaseaux, Edinger, Reperant, Russell, and Sigogneau. I think of Radinsky as one of the best of these morphologists, although I reject his quantitative analysis of encephalization (pp. 374-78 and Appendix III). Localization is a peripheral issue for me, because it can be used only in conjunction with the principle of proper mass to suggest the evolution of specialized functions in a species. It normally contributes to a cladistic analysis, though it may occasionally be used to suggest an advance in function. My main difficulty with the analysis of localiza- tion of function on an endocast is that there is no localization on the endocast. It exists on the brain, and even on the brain one is often hard put to identify localized regions on the basis of gross morphology if one has not also mapped the regions electrophysiologically (Woolsey 1960). Since the latter mapping will never be done on the brains of the fossil mammals, I tend to be more conservative than Radinsky about using those data. This is not true for the data on gross brain size, in which there are clear parallels between the analyses of fossil and living forms, and there is usually no question about the comparability of the 416 C U RRE N T A N TH RO POLO G Y</page><page sequence="15">Jerison: EVOLUTION OF THE BRAIN AND INTELLIGENCE analyses. Finally, from the point of view of the evolution of intelligence, the evolution of specialized functions may actually distract one from the main line-that is, the evolution of additional information-processing capacity. In one special sense, reorganization, unlike localization, is quite central to my analysis, because one cannot have encephalization without reorganization. There is more tissue in the system available for "extra" work, and even if that consists of merely doing some job slightly better, that is also a variety of reorganization. If one defines reorganization in strictly morphological terms, as changes in the relative sizes of the parts of the brain, the point is made even more simply. The encephalization factor does not contribute equally to the sizes of all parts of the brain. It contributes hardly at all to the size of the medulla and paleocortex. This means that if there is encephalization, some parts of the brain necessarily become relatively larger than other parts, which means that reorganization is a necessary consequence of encephalization. When such reorganization is defined quantitatively and statistically it can be derived from brain:body analysis. Speculations based on observed reorganization of the brains of living animals without support by quantitative methods provide much less adequate evidence, and the evidence is potentially quite misleading. I must note finally, and somewhat regretfully, that contrary to Radinsky's remark I do not really cite Rensch as a source of evidence on the relationship between brain size and intelligence. I merely indicate that one outcome of my theory of brain size predicts a result published by Rensch. One of my regrets about the book is that I have not cited Rensch's (1959) great work sufficiently, or with sufficient respect. This is entirely because of my skepticism about his analysis of intelligence, which I think is off the mark. To go into my reasons would involve too much of a digression here, but a careful discussion would certainly have been warranted in my book. It would have required a different kind of speculation, philosophical rather than scientific, and I am afraid that such speculation is, at least at present, not much to my taste. EVOLUTrIoN The variety of views that one can take of the evolutionary process explains the diversity of remarks on this issue by the various reviewers. Coon enters into the spirit of my book with his poetic review of its thesis, and Count correctly identifies my position as accepting the neo-Darwinian syn- thetic theory as the framework for thought about evolu- tionary processes. I did not make a serious effort to present the theoretical framework, however, and assumed that most readers would have sufficient background on evolution for my purpose. A serious analysis would have required an extended treatment of issues in population genetics and the development of a theory that would relate brain:body "allometry" to my analysis of the meaning of brain size. To do this one must have data on within-species variation, and these are simply not available in enough of the fossil record. Gould (1971, 1975b) states the problem precisely and suggests the direction for its solution. Evolution can be viewed as fact as well as theory, and my effort was to present the facts of brain evolution analyzed in a way to be relevant to the evolution of intelligence. Those facts come from the fossil record and necessarily involve one in the study of endocasts. There are related facts derived from comparative neurology. These are evolutionary, in a sense, but their status depends on evolutionary theory and they do not present evolutionary evidence in an unequivocal way. (This is one of the issues considered by Count.) Their evolutionary analysis requires the combination of theories of homology of neural struc- tures and a kind of scala naturae (Hodos 1970). They are clearly relevant to the understanding of cladistic evolution- ary trends, because they must be interpreted as evidence of the present diversity of species with respect to the brain. As a source of information about anagenetic trends, in which one identifies "grades" rather than "clades" of evolu- tion, comparative data on living species must be used with great care in that one must identify relict species with respect to brain evolution. These are not necessarily the same as the species identified taxonomically as relicts (pp. 6-7). The distinction between evolutionary facts available di- rectly from the fossil record and those available by inference from the diversity of living animals is somuetimes difficult to maintain. A number of the criticisms offered by the reviewers run into difficulties because of this problem. In other cases, criticisms involve the interpretation of evolu- tionary facts about which there is an incomplete consensus. In still others, the criticisms are to the point, well-taken, and probably correct. Let me review the criticisms of my evolutionary statements in more or less chronological order with respect to the earth's history. This will take us a bit out of the range of the usual anthropological discussion, but it may be useful as illustration of conceptions and misconceptions in evolutionary analysis and how they can confuse unsuspecting authors, critics, and readers. The first criticism is on the evolution of teleost fish. I review the evolution of fish in Chapter 5 and summarize it sketchily in the introduction. The latter is mentioned by Andrew when he criticizes my statement about the absence of major changes in the fish brain since the Devonian period (about 400 million years ago). Andrew is, of course, right to point out that the teleost radiation was largely a phenomenon of the last 100 million years, but we lack fossil data on their brains. The "major" changes to which I was referring in the introduction were in relative brain size. The special lesson here for anthropologists is in the distinction between cladistic and anagenetic evolution, an issue with which anthropologists are now well acquainted as a result of the work of, e.g., Campbell (1972) and Tobias (1973). When Andrew criticizes me for stating that there was "no major change" in the fish brain in its post-Devonian evolution, he is referring to the truly major cladistic change, that is, the adaptive radiation. The criticism is not warrant- ed, since I did report, and even illustrated, those adaptive variations in the brains of living fish (fig 5.6, etc.). The proposition that there has been no significant anagenetic change in the fish brain in the class Osteichthyes (bony fish), however, is very nearly true in that the same approxi- mate "grade" of relative brain size was maintained through- out that long period of geological history. The only excep- tion to this may be the mormyrids and other electric fish (Bullock 1969, and personal communication), which I discuss briefly in Chapter 5. We should now move to the evolution of the earliest mammals, about 200 million years ago, but in order to keep the discussion of mammals (including the primates and man) in a single sequence I will first respond to two other criticisms: Doty's on the early birds and Wind's on the major reptilian extinctions at the end of the Mesozoic era. Doty's inference from my conjectures about the selection pressures faced by the first birds illustrates the difficulty of maintaining an appropriate historical perspective. The selection pressures that produced an enlarged brain in Archaeopteryx, the earliest bird, did not result in a brain that had reached the grade of encephalization of any living Vol. 16 No. 3 September 1975 417</page><page sequence="16">bird. It is the comparison between this early bird and the reptiles that one must keep in mind in the analysis of the role of the visual environment. Once an avian pattern was established, the further evolution of the birds was likely to be within that pattern (according to conservation princi- ples). Such further evolution could have been effected by adaptations to other niches, and other factors might explain the further and differential enlargement of the brain in later birds, including living birds (see pp. 278-80 and also Ostrom 1974). Wind's discussion of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic transition is close to views formerly held but now rejected by most paleontologists. The time relationships that I described were not my conjectures; rather, they are consistent with the present "canon" in vertebrate paleontology. I will, of course, look forward to Wind's (1975) more detailed analysis. Present evidence supports the view that the reptilian extinc- tion was completed before the significant adaptive radiation of mammals into niches for large herbivores and carnivores, and that there was a time gap between the major reptilian extinction and the first major mammalian adaptive radia- tion (Olson 1972, Tappan 1974). There is evidence against Wind's suggestion about atmos- pheric oxygen (Tappan 1974). I did not discuss the issue because it is complex and somewhat uncertain, but I will try to answer specific points he raises. First, although "oxygenation" does not appear in my book, "oxygen" may be found on the ordinate in fig. 12. 1A, which compares lower and higher vertebrate muscle with respect to oxygen consumption at different body temperatures. To illustrate the problem of interpreting such data, however, we should note that many reptiles are capable of anaerobic metabolism (Bennett and Licht 1972, Bennett and Ruben 1975). Reptiles might, therefore, be more capable than mammals of surviv- ing reduced atmospheric oxygenation. Tappan (1974) dis- cusses this issue and presents the same kinds of explanations for the reptilian extinctions that I did. She also points out, as does Olson (1972), that the extinctions at the end of the Mesozoic were very extensive, and included many families of fish and mammals and many reptiles other than the dinosaurs and other archosaurians. I reviewed the evidence on homoiothermy in my book (pp. 259-61, etc.), and there is more in Olson (1972), Hammel, Crawshaw, and Cabanac (1973), and Tappan (1974). The evidence favors the evolution of endothermy or homoiothermy in the earliest mammals, and perhaps even in the mammal-like reptiles, and there is also evidence for at least homoiothermy in the large reptiles and in the pterosaurs. Tappan has charted the change of phytoplank- ton, which should be positively correlated with atmospheric oxygen, during the past 600 million years. Phytoplankton levels during most of the Cretaceous were higher than they are today, and although there was a precipitous drop at the end of the Mesozoic, followed by a rapid recovery, the levels never fell as low as those typical of the Triassic period, when the exuberant adaptive radiation of the archosaurians began. Wind's suggestions are ingenious, but they may have to be more comprehensive if he is to provide a genuine alternative to the conventional paleontological account. Mammalian evolution. We can now go on to the evolution of the mammals, and here I have generated some sharp reactions. The first problem involves the initial enlargement of the mammalian brain, at least 150 million years ago, according to the evidence of Triconodon. Was the brain really enlarged? In attacking me for a "a general lack of methodological rigor," Radinsky shows that EQ in this specimen could have ranged from 0.11 to 0.49. He has used my equations, tables, and graphs to make these computations, and I am pleased that he found these sufficiently complete to enable him to do so. The reason for computing EQ was to decide whether Triconodon was beyond the reptilian range, in which the maximum EQ is about 0.07. One must conclude, either from the range of values offered by Radinsky or the single value (EQ = 0.28) that I offered, that Triconodon was mammalian in brain size. Its value(s) fell pretty much in the range of the archaic Paleogene mammals of 40 to 60 million years ago (0.11 &lt; EQ&lt; 0.37 in my sample of 13 species). Next we consider why the brain became enlarged. Andrew and Doty take me to task for assuming that the earliest mammals were surviving "reptiles," as it were, that had become unusually well adapted to nocturnal niches, an adaptation that enabled them to coexist with the dominant diurnal Mesozoic reptiles. For rather different reasons, both object to my hypothesis, which would relegate vision as a fine distance sense to a lower status than audition and olfaction. This is an elegant hypothesis because it explains the evolLtion of an enlarged brain as the solution to a packaging problem rather than as an evolutionary novelty related to "intelligence." Doty's objections are both less serious and more interest- ing than Andrew's. Doty's basic point is based on Lende's (1963) work showing a somewhat more extensive visual than auditory cortex in the Virginia opossum, the former mapped by evoked (electrical) responses by the brain to an "electronic light flash" and the latter by evoked responses to clicks from a loudspeaker. In all instances the opossums were anaesthetized. The procedure was similar to those used for most cortical-mapping studies of that period, and is subject to the usual criticisms of electrophysiological mapping of the brain. One may question a mapping of auditory cortex with evoked responses to clicks with unstated wave forms and energy distributions. One may also question the validity of comparing these maps with a mapping of visual cortex in which evoked potentials are elicited by what I judge to have been the intense broad-band spectrum of something like a "Grass Instruments" photostimulator. There are related problems because of the unusual audiogram of the opossum, which indicates poor sensitivity and flat "peak" sensitivity between about 2 kHz and 32 kHz (Masterton, Heffner, and Ravizza 1969). There is even a problem with the behavioral study that measured the audiogram, in that electric shock to the paws provided the reinforcement. Anyone (myself included) who has ever used shock rein- forcement with opossums can tell interesting tales about the uncertain effectiveness of the conditioning procedure. There is, finally, the unknown (to me), but presumably typical, scotopic (or photopic?) sensitivity of the opossum and the relationship between sensitivity and acuity to the brain maps. These are standard questions, but they illustrate the reason for concluding so many reports with a statement about the need for more research. Assuming that Lende's work is accepted without ques- tions, there is still no serious challenge to my hypothesis, which does not state that all vision was "replaced" by audition and olfaction. It is concerned with "fine" vision, that is, vision by the cone system of the eye. There is clearly a role for vision by the rod system in nocturnal animals (see pp. 20, 271-75, etc.). In fact, it is essential to the analysis that there be significant visual representation in the brain of the earliest mammals. I used the requirement for integration of information from these two modalities to explain the encoding of stimulus-sources as "objects" when they are represented by massive neural inputs through the auditory and visual channels at the same time (p. 20, etc.). My intention was to discuss the evolution of fine distance senses, and nocturnal rod vision is an order of magnitude less fine in resolving power than diurnal cone 418 C U RRE N T A N TH RO POLO G Y</page><page sequence="17">Jerison: EVOLUTION OF THE BRAIN AND INTELLIGENCE vision (Fite 1973). It is the fine distance sense that has to be supplemented by audition and olfaction, because of the reduced resolving power of the visual system when the cone system (normal for reptiles) is no longer functional. This is the situation for nocturnal mammals today, and their condition is therefore an appropriate model for that of the earliest mammals with respect to the minimum necessary sensory equipment. It is more difficult to phrase a constructive reply to Andrew's criticisms (paragraph four of his review), because they may involve misinformation about the status of the reptilian and mammalian eye and ear in the early Mesozoic era when the transition from mammal-like reptiles to mammals occurred. Like Doty, Andrew apparently does not realize that I was referring to the evolution of fine distance sensing systems, which followed the loss of cone vision for color sensitivity and fine acuity, despite the emphasis on rod vision that now is characteristic of the mammals. On specific issues: (1) The "eutherian eye" was about 100 million years in the future when the evolutionary events that I discuss occurred. (2) The statement about nocturnality is exactly the same as mine-my contribution was to look for implications of nocturnality for the evolving mammalian brain. (3) Andrew's example of the mouse is fine, although I suspect that the earliest mammals had less corticalized vision than the mouse. It would be interest- ing to map visual fields in didelphids, insectivores, and rodents to provide a clearer statement of the "proper mass" of a visual field, and to do the same for tonotopic auditory and tactile fields. (4) The issue of homologies of functional and structural systems in the brain is a difficult one (Hodos 1970). Nevertheless, one does not question the fundamental idea that homologies, e.g., of the tectal system, should be present, and this would be an example of "conservation" as discussed in the text. But this is not really relevant for my analysis of the evolving visual system. (5) The way in which the auditory areas may have been used as models for the visual system is discussed on pp. 412-15. One may think of the auditory system (in this case of archaic mam- mals) as setting performance specifications that had to be met by the visual system, e.g., with respect to the length of time that information is stored in a "short-term memory." (6) Andrew has the therapsid-mammal relationship con- fused, perhaps from a careless reading of Manley's (1973) discussion. The therapsids (mammal-like reptiles) had much reduced stapes, and some were apparently well on their way to freeing the "extra" reptilian jaw and skull bones to make up the other bones of the middle ear. The statement about "unusually dominant" vision in therapsids makes no sense to me. My assumptions are generally conservative (in the evolutionary sense), and I assume no more than that a late Permian or early Triassic reptile was likely to have normal reptilian vision, which is retino-tectal cone vision, unless it was evolving toward adaptations in noctur- nal niches. I should note here that Coon caught the sense of my argument quite clearly, and I do not think that my exposi- tion was to blame for these errors. Despite my rather harsh response to Andrew on this issue and my only slightly less blunt response to Doty, for me this is the most productive kind of debate, since it forces the "antagonists" to marshal the available data, which are now considerable, and to take fresh critical looks at some "classic" experiments. This is a good place to correct my statement (p. 273) that mammalian cones evolved from rods. I found this in Walls (1963, originally published in 1942) and used it to support the idea of reevolution of cone vision in newly diurnal Tertiary mammals. Recent research (Young 1970) shows that there are fundamental properties in the ultrastructure that probably distinguish all vertebrate rods from cones. The difference between these two kinds of photoreceptors must have appeared early in vertebrate evolution and was conserved thereafter. The reevolution of good diurnal vision in mammals must, therefore, be explained in terms of selection pressures to increase the density of cones in certain parts of the retina as well as the number of cones in the retina. Predator-prey relations. We can now discuss (with less debate) the matter of predator-prey relations as these are related to brain size. All of the reviewers who consider this issue recognize the importance of the result that suggested a "positive feedback loop" (to use Gould's phrase) in which carnivores were "racing" with their herbivore prey and maintained a slight lead in EQ. Doty uses this as a point of departure for some interesting speculations about the early hominids as predators with themselves as prey. This will certainly be a contribution (perhaps not welcomed by all paleoanthropologists) to the question of the several species of australopithecines and habilines ranging broadly over the same area. Gould (1975a) also indulges in interest- ing speculations on this theme, suggesting that it might help us understand the much greater encephalization of some living sharks (as major predator species) relative to the bony fish, and the somewhat greater encephalization of- the predatory dinosaurs relative to their prey species. Both Radinsky and Washburn recognize the importance of principles developed from the carnivore-ungulate bal- ance, which could be analyzed because of the excellent fossil record that was available. Andrew challenges the validity of my interpretation of the absence of progressive encephalization in the South American ungulates as due to an absence of strong selection pressures by progressive predators. My analysis involves a careful interplay between quantitative analysis, theory, and naturalistic explanations and makes testable quantita- tive predictions. His alternative hypotheses contribute no predictions (or understanding) about the evolution of the brain and are heavily dependent on purely naturalistic reasoning from present ecological conditions. It would require a long essay to respond to each of his specific points, and I must agree that his position and argument are quite reasonable as ethological, ecological, and general biological statements. Their principal weak- nesses arise from their inconsistency with the paleonto- logical evidence on the adaptations of various archaic mammals, such as the arctocyonids (which are classified with the archaic ungulates) and the creodonts (which are now classified as a separate archaic order of carnivorous mammals, distinct from the order Carnivora). Present ecological balances are uncertain guides to paleoecology, because uniformitarianism can be an uncertain guide to the life of the past (Gould 1965). The early Tertiary mammalian radiation was, apparently, poor in predatory species, and this may help account for the exuberant diversification of ungulate species that had both herbivorous and carnivorous habits. Whether the latter were active predators is uncertain, but, as I reported, paleontologists tend to doubt it. Such an ecological imbalance is not unique in the fossil record; it occurred in the lower Permian, when the carnivorous and very large mammallike reptile Dimetro- don (with the sail-like spinal "fan") seems to have had no obvious land tetrapod species on which to prey (Olson 1972). With respect to nonmammalian predators and brain size, there is no argument. I make the same kind of point as Andrew's in my analysis of selection pressures on early primates (p. 412). But the question is more subtle and is analogous to the neural control of flight. Very little neural Vol. 16 No. 3 September 1975 419</page><page sequence="18">tissue is required by insects for this purpose, whereas the same general adaptation by vertebrates requires consider- ably more tissue. The fact that lower vertebrates can be specialized to prey successfully on mammals does not mean that predatory mammals can be at a "lower-vertebrate" grade with respect to brain size. The quantitative analysis in my book led to the (for me) surprising discovery that predation in mammals might be associated with selection for enlarged brains. I tested that "discovery" as a hypothesis, using the South American ungulates as my sample, because the paleontological evidence indicated the absence of pro- gressive predator species. rhe test was an "evolutionary experiment," and it supported the hypothesis. It is only after the fact that Andrew offers his hypothesis about the lack of diversity and isolation of habitats to explain the result. I know of no evidence for this hypothesis, and it seems to me that the unusual parallelisms between the morphology and apparent adaptations of South American mammals and those of their Holarctic counterparts argue against Andrew's point. The marsupials developed their own sabretooth "cats"; the species of one of the families of the South American order Litopterna were horselike in appearance and even more clearly than the equids progressed from three-toed to one-toed evolutionary grades. Many more parallelisms are discussed in various references cited in Chapter 14. Andrew chides me because I do not seem to use the evidence of teeth, skull, and limbs. I do use that evidence, usually by using taxonomic criteria for my comparisons and citing the paleontological literature to suggest behav- ioral adaptations. It should not be necessary to redevelop or rediscover the work of a major scientific discipline when it is already easily accessible. Primates. Because of its obvious interest to anthro- pologists, I should reply to criticism regarding primates in greatest detail. But the reviewers themselves carry the debate, and I think I can restrict myself to a few points, mainly those raised by Radinsky, who has done the most with primate endocasts. References to his most recent work and to work on fossil hominid endocasts, as well as my interpretation of the evidence on encephalization and reorganization in the primate and hominid brain, are included in my recent review (Jerison 1975), which updates the book in these areas. The first question is: when did the primate brain begin to change its shape? This is a question that can be answered more easily by a picture than by verbal argument (see fig. 1). An important element here is the difference in size of the specimens. The largest of the Eocene primates with known endocast is represented by Smilodectes (fig. 1 a), which is traced from a specimen in which most of the zygomatic arch is absent but which is complete from snout to occipital condyle. It obviously was a much smaller animal than Plesiadapis (fig. 1 b) or the living opossum (fig. 1 c). In the latter two specimens the zygomatic arch was present, and I indicate its anterior and posterior portions on the skulls. The obvious error in Radinsky's judgment (assuming that I saw the braincase correctly in Szalay's [1971] stereoscopic photograph, from which fig. lb was traced) can be understood as an error in accounting for differences in gross size. In photographs, one enlarges or reduces illustrations to make them aesthetically pleasing, and similar in apparent size. This can result in serious misinterpreta- tions of evidence, as I pointed out in my discussion of Mesozoic mammals (p. 214, n. 3). When scale factors are maintained, we can see that the braincase of Plesiadapis was comparable in shape to and probably somewhat larger than that of Smilodectes, though it occupied a smaller fraction of the skull. This is a typical finding when animals are of different size, and one would need more information 2 cm ........... . ................... .......... .. .... ..... FIG. 1.

Note scale at top. (on brain:body and brain:skull relations) to determine how large a braincase would be expected in Plesiadapis if it were encephalized to the same extent as Smilodectes. The comparison with the opossum, on the other hand, is unequivocal. The 60-million-year-old primate Plesiadapis clearly had a much larger and more rounded braincase than does the living opossum. The comparison is direct because skull size is about the same. Radinsky's statement about comparability with rodents is inappropriate. Typical living rodents are at about the same grade of encephalization as Smilodectes (EQ-0.6), and it would be much more difficult to judge the shape of the brain from the braincase alone. The comparison with the opossum (EQ 0.25) is more appropriate, since the opposum is quite similar to archaic mammals with respect to the general appearance of skull and endocast. In this case it was especially appropriate in view of the similar gross size of the skulls of Plesiadapis and the opossum. Figure 1 supports my view as quoted by Radinsky. Radinsky's odd statement about the primates as an order compared to other progressive mammalian orders, in his comment on my citation of Clark, may refer to the matter of convolutedness. I quoted Clark to summarize a point of view, and it would have been awkward to replace three words by dots. It should be plain from other parts of the text that I consider convolutedness to be related to brain size independently of taxon (e.g., my discussion on pp. 297-98). Clark, too, recognized this relationship, and that phrase in the quotation was clearly inappropriate. What is important is the relatively large primate brain, and my chapter presents the evidence confirming his assertion on that point. It is possible that Radinsky does not accept the evidence on brain size, because his analyses of encephalization, in which the foramen magnum is used as the statistical "control" for body size, lead to somewhat equivocal results on this matter. It was for this reason that I devoted so much space (pp. 374-78 and Appendix III) to the statistical analysis of his method. I showed that if the foramen magnum was used instead of body size it would control (in the statistical sense) both the encephalization and the body-size factors, leaving residuals that could not be inter- preted as adequate measures of encephalization. I discuss 420 C U RRE N T AN T H RO POLOG Y</page><page sequence="19">Tertson: EVOLUTION OF THE BRAIN AND INTELLIGENCE possible biological reasons for this in Jerison (1975). Primates do differ and have always differed from other progressive orders of land mammals with respect to en- cephalization as measured by EQ. Gould's comment on this is correct and Radinsky's is wrong. The other orders have values of EQ -1.0, whereas living primates have values of EQ -2.0. A statistical analysis of the phenomenon is given in Appendix II. I am grateful to King for pointing out the problems in my discussion of brachiation in hominid evolution and directing me to the appropriate literature. It is clear that I have some homework to do on biomechanics. The idea of brachiation was attractive to me because it helps account for the way hands and tools interact: a tool user can swing a free tool with a hand attached to a fixed body by using the same mechanical system that evolved to enable a "free" body attached to a hand to swing on a fixed branch. It is too bad that not all elegant ideas are necessarily true, and I hope that King can suggest some way to salvage this one. A number of reviewers (Andrew, King, Washburn, Wind) express interest in a further discussion of the evolution of language. I discuss it a bit more in Jerison (1975), but the problem for me arises from the inadequacy of fossil data. I did not find the Lieberman and Crelin (1971) article convincing, despite their excellent anatomical analysis of where the voice box would be placed and how that would affect the producible sounds of Neanderthals. Their analysis of brain shape was inappropriate for this issue. The only useful evidence that I have seen is from reported asymmetry of the sylvian fissure in one Neanderthal endocast (LeMay 1975). I agree strongly with Washburn's comment on this issue, in particular his reservation about functional equiva- lence. As a comparative and physiological psychologist I remain somewhat skeptical about the articles mentioned by Wind on language in chimpanzees. (There is no issue about language in microencephalic humans; Doty's analysis is entirely appropriate.) I cited only Premack because I think his work is the most thoughtfully and carefully performed and states the problems most clearly. One often underesti- mates the capacity of animals to learn and perform complex tasks. The effect of the study of animal "language," in my judgment, is to force linguists to define language more precisely rather than to demonstrate "language' in chimpanzees. We must, after all, know what it is that we are trying to demonstrate. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES A host of issues raised by the reviewers can be described as methodological, if one includes in this category problems ranging from the quality of the illustrations (Doty: a quick answer-we will try to improve in future editions) to the philosophy of science (Welker, Wind, et al.). In this section I comment on questions of rigor raised by Andrew and by Radinsky, on the measures of encephalization, discussed especially by Coon, Count, Moss, and Washburn, and on the methodology of evolutionary studies. As a general point in the philosophy of science, I am especially pleased that Welker sees in my theoretical frame- work something to "provide guidelines within which more specific [hypotheses] can be formulated." This can correct the "dichotomy" to which Radinsky objects, because the various cladistic trends evident in the evolution of fissural patterns actually are easier to understand within the frame- work of the presence or absence of trends toward encepha- ization. The diversity of style and substance in the various reviews is material for the sociology of science as well as its philosophy. I wondered as I read Andrew's description of his irritation with my "idiosyncratic" work whether I might not have reacted in exactly the same way had I maintained only my original activities in studies of brain function (e.g., Jerison and Neff 1953, Yellin and Jerison 1973), or worked entirely on attention (e.g., Jerison 1957, 1968, 1970) or in the various other areas that have been my "other life" while indulging my special passion for the dusty drawers of paleontological collections. Having learned some of the tools of the trade in several disciplines, I probably have less respect for the "accepted canons" that Moss mentions, although there are few things more elegant for me than real technical expertise as it is exercised in those disciplines. The accepted canons are necessary if we are to keep our bearings in our individual disciplines, and we are sensitive to apparent violations, especially when they touch on what we think of as fundamentals. In raising the very questions that Andrew recognizes as important, my book was bound to be irritating to some readers, and perhaps most irritating to readers like Andrew, who have thought deeply about some of the same issues (Andrew 1962) but reached different conclusions. I take as a great compliment Coon's comparing my book to D'Arcy Thompson's, but I am also aware of the unusual history of that great work. Only now, with the development of multivariate methods and computer graphics, does it seem about to enter the mainstream of science. Ideas do not really have lives of their own, and it is well to be aware that they are, in a sense, collective properties of human minds. In order to provide a properly nourishing environment for my ideas, I am obliged to defend their scientific respectability. I appreciate Gould's accolade on my contribution to paleontology and the special remarks by Doty and by Welker, which are testimonials by leading neuroscientists that I did not strain the limits of neurophys- iology and neuroanatomy in my theoretical analysis and speculations. They are joined by almost all of the other reviewers in judgments ranging from mild to enthusiastic approval of my methods. But two of the reviewers, Andrew and Radinsky, challenge my work on the grounds of accuracy and rigor, and my first response on method must be to the issues that they raise. Accuracy and rigor. Andrew's challenge will be considered first. I have already discussed the concept of perceptual worlds, which he finds inadequately presented. I will not discuss his other questions on perceptual worlds or his questions on brain size; these seem to me misunderstandings resulting from a somewhat hasty reading of my book. I must respond, however, to his assertion about my cavalier treatment of complex processes, which he claims I sum up "briefly and inaccurately" and with out-of-date or inadequate references. Andrew offers three examples to support his charge. The first is on the evolution of teleost fish; this has already been discussed. The second is based on the following statement (p. 161): "Is an insect's reflex system fundamen- tally different, in a way, from the hypothetical vertebrate system that creates maps of possible worlds? I suspect it is." My statement was made to provide a contrast in illustrating my analysis of vertebrates, but it is supported by Wilson's superb monograph on social insects (Wilson 1970:197-224, especially his figure 11-6 and the discussion on pp. 216-19). I have discussed this question many times with my colleague Stephen Bernstein, occasionally while watching his ants run their mazes (see Bernstein and Bernstein 1969; Wilson 1970:223). Bernstein argues against my view, but Wilson's discussion and illustration indicate why I was "suspicious" when I wrote the passage and remain Vol. 16 No. 3 September 1975 421</page><page sequence="20">so. I chose my words carefully and stand by them. Finally, it is not only "helpful" to cite Lashley (he is not quoted), but would be unthinkable not to, when first mentioning mass action. For the unwary reader I must say that, despite its great reputation, Lashley's work is vulnerable on some points, and his personal reputation has been attacked in the discussion in Diamond (1973:232- 33). In may view the best defense is in the body of his work (Beach et al. 1960) and in the continuing interest in his concepts. It is obviously important to integrate mass-action effects such as the "expectancy wave" in the human and animal electroencephalogram (Donchin et al. 1973) with the basic organization of the brain according to "wiring diagrams" (John 1972, John and Bartlett 1973). If these are typical examples of my "inaccuracies" and inadequate citations, Andrew's charge is clearly inappro- priate; it reflects hasty reading and the confusion of bias with judgment. The only example with any substantive merit is the question about insect worlds, and this has no merit as a criticism because my statement of a "suspicion" is not the summing up of "complex phenomena and processes." To cite Wilson's work or any other work to support my view would have misled the reader about my certainty. Radinsky charges that my book suffers from "a general lack of conceptual rigor." He implies such lack of rigor in his question on my estimate of brain:endocast relations in reptiles and amphibians. Let me answer: In addition to the iguanid illustrated in my figure 2.1 (p. 29), Ralph Molnar and I dissected Ctenosaura pectinata. I based my estimate on these, the literature cited on pp. 28-30 and p. 144, and the data in my table 6.1. I discussed the weakness of this evidence on p. 144 and suggested this as an easily solvable methodological problem. Radinsky's colleague, James Hopson, is now planning to make the necessary measurements on young and adult crocodiles and other reptiles. I would argue that it is a virtue of the book that it raises and explains this issue, and I doubt that Hopson would have undertaken his study otherwise. Radinsky's discussion of the variability of estimates of EQ in Triconodon is an instance of misplaced meticu- lousness. For me rigor is the application of an amount of precision appropriate to one's measure and to the problem. As I have shown above, the "imprecision" that Radinsky finds in EQ for Triconodon demonstrates that, despite its apparent unreliability, this measure is actually sufficiently reliable for the questions raised. I also provided enough information for a check on my computations and method. I do not expect Radinsky to be able to criticize my analysis of intelligence from an expert position, but his questions about brain size and intelligence are important. Although these were answered in the book in much the same way as in this reply, the basic questions are so difficult that it is always appropriate to review them. I have done that here, presenting a new twist by outlining the logic of my approach. That was directed at Radinsky as well as the other morphologists who raised questions about brain and intelligence, and I hope that it helped indicate the level of rigor that can at present be applied to this issue. Radinsky misunderstands the problem in the comparison of giant Pleistocene mammals with their Recent relatives. The point was to describe how EQ failed when it was applied to closely related species. This is really done in figure 15.7, which graphs brain:body data (not EQ) on log-log coordinates. Variability or "error" was likely to be of the order of magnitude of the size of the data points (actually small circles) drawn on the brain:body coordinate system. It is extremely unlikely that significant changes in the pattern of relations shown in figure 15.7 would have arisen had I been able to find other living species which could be matched appropriately to the fossils. The most complete misfiring of Radinsky's criticism is on the comparison of the size of the olfactory bulbs of archaic mammals with those of living mammals. Here he chides me for not matching my Recent mammals to the archaic forms with respect to ecological niche when testing the hypothesis that "primitive mammals had relatively larger olfactory bulbs than recent mammals have" (p. 252). This hypothesis is almost a cliche in evolutionary thought, and the concept of ecological niche is not relevant to the hypothesis. In fact, the superficiality of the hypothesis is revealed by the fact that it ignores ecological niche. The true situation is that the size of the olfactory bulbs is significantly affected by ecological niche just as niche is the major determinant of all brain specializations (see p. 15). I should add that (as Radinsky can probably guess), had I included data of ungulate endocasts now available to me (Bison, Camelops, Dama), exactly the same results would have been obtained. These results, which demon- strated an allometric relation of olfactory bulb size to body size, showed that many living progressive mammals had larger olfactory bulbs relative to their body size than did the archaic sample. The hypothesis quoted earlier could be rejected. Elsewhere (pp. 221-24) I had shown that other large progressive mammals (e.g., Homo sapiens) had much smaller olfactory bulbs, and I discussed the relationship of the size of the olfactory bulbs to ecological niche (rather than primitiveness) at that point. There is a hint in the data that there was "encephalization" of the olfactory bulbs in the evolution of mammals in "macrosmatic" niches. This is worth further study, and for this problem ecological niche would have to be carefully controlled. A more cogent criticism Qffered by Radinsky is that the book is insufficiently concerned with variability. This is true of those parts of the text in which the evidence on variability is too inadequate for the purpose of the exposi- tion (as in the earliest mammals) or irrelevant for the issue (as in the Pleistocene-Recent comparison). I emphasize between-species variability in the analysis of the evolution of diversity (Chapters 13 and 14) and give data on between- species variability, with less emphasis, in all of my other substantive chapters, including that on primates. I also use such data in the statistical analyses in appendices II and III in more or less conventional ways. But I do not stress variability as a source of error, because I believe that it is a minor problem for this between-species analysis. Esti- mates of within-species variability will become much more important in future work, not so much to control error of measurement as to contribute to a better mathematical model for the evolutionary process by introducing methods of population genetics (Gould 1975b). If Radinsky is to provide constructive criticisms for those like myself who rely on his research, he might do well to rethink his views on size as a biological variable. Un- derestimating or misunderstanding the importance of this variable (a fairly typical condition of many biologists) can lead to elementary morphological errors. These are cor- rectable by taking size and scale into account. The problem and its solution are nicely illustrated in the analysis sum- marized here in figure 1. Measurement. Almost all of the reviewers refer to the measurement of encephalization, either in general terms or in terms of the encephalization quotient EQ or the extra-neurons parameter NC. Rather than comment on all of the statements, I shall limit myself to a few remarks relevant to most of them. Both EQ and N, are technically "residuals" in an analysis in which a theoretical allometric equation is used as if it were a regression equation. The use of these indices to measure encephalization implies 422 C U RRE N T AN TH RO PO LO G Y</page><page sequence="21">Jerison: EVOLUTION OF THE BRAIN AND INTELLIGENCE some hypothesis about what makes for equal degrees of encephalization in different species. When the EQ measure is used, it implies that mammals are equally encephalized if their brains are some multiple of the brain size expected according to the allometric equation for theoretical average living mammals. (This equation is, of course, estimated by curve-fitting to the data of actual living mammals.) It is thus a ratio of measured brain size to expected brain size. The NC measure is an absolute number, not a ratio. When it is the index, mammals will be rated as equally encephalized when their brain sizes would be sufficient to pack NC neurons added to the brain size that is expected according to a theoretical allometric equation for primitive mammals. (The latter equation is also estimated from data, either on living or on fossil forms.) This approach never results in meaningful data when used to compare individual animals of a single species. The analysis is between-species. The contrast between the utility of EQ for comparisons at or nears the ordinal level but not below the family level and the uitlity of NC for comparisons among genera or species within the order Primates poses a scientific problem that is yet to be resolved. The justification for this kind of analysis is that it states precisely what might otherwise be stated vaguely in descrip- tions of species as having large or small brains. Furthermore, as a result of performing many analyses one gets a fair sense of the probable form of the theoretical mammalian or vertebrate allometric equations, which can then be analyzed for dimensional implications and biological signif- icance. One also gets a clearer idea of the significance of the concept of encephalization in empirical studies and as a statistical concept. (The usage of "statistical" in the latter instance is as in "statistical mechanics" and does not involve issues of hypothesis testing, statistical inference, or descriptive statistics.) Because of the technical structure of the indices, one should normally use cranial capacity directly rather than an index for most comparisons in hominid evolution. This is because of the small range of body sizes in living and fossil hominid species and the relatively small fraction of the total brain size in highly encephalized mammals (such as hominids) that would be accounted for by body size. Almost no information is added by using an index in place of cranial capacity, and one may even be misled by the index to the extent that the assumptions underlying it are inappropriate. The EQ index, for example, is a very poor one for the study of phyletic change in hominids, because it will be overly sensitive to errors in the estimation of body size, and it will be inversely related to body size in equally encephalized species. The NC index is less mislead- ing, mainly because it is relatively insensitive to the effect of body size, but also because it probably reflects the changes in the brain that are assumed to have occurred: differential enlargement of parts of the brain rather than the magni- fication of the entire brain. (The NC index is factorially equivalent to indices using allometric exponents of the order of 0.2-0.3 for primates.) The only instance in which I would prefer the NC index to a direct measure of cranial capacity in the analysis of hominid evolution is where body size is treated as a major variable. I would then follow the procedure reviewed in Jerison (1975) and be very tentative about conclusions based directly on the values of this index. Washburn's point about the components of body size is well-taken as a general principle, although it probably does not affect most of the analyses in the book. Because they were between-species analyses, usually at the ordinal level, these analyses were unusually insensitive to error, as Gould recognizes. My greatest reservation in this respect is in the analysis of encephalization in groups under selection pressures toward small or light bodies, in particular the birds, bats, and flying reptiles. Other interesting exam- ples occur in very small mammals, in which gravid females may weigh more than twice as much as other adults, male or female. Instead of allometric equations I prefer to use minimum convex polygons, if these permit a sufficiently discrimi- nating analysis. In response to Moss's query, I will review the mathematical and biological advantages of the polygons. The mathematical superiority of the method arises from the fact that fewer assumptions are required to determine the polygon from the data, and some of the questionable assumptions of curve-fitting used in allometric analysis are avoided. The questionable assumptions are that "errors" are random, that the function is continuous, and that the (log) function is linear. The allometric function also carries some questionable theoretical baggage for between-species analysis, which results from the original development of allometry to handle the problem of relative growth, as summarized by Moss. Count's willingness to table his "un- enthusiasm over the Dubois encephalization index" is a generous way of putting his skepticism about the linearity of the allometric function. He could have no comparable objection to the convex polygons, which merely show where in brain:body space a group of points (species) is to be found. The biological advantages of the polygons parallel the mathematical ones. The use of polygons requires no as- sumptions about the details of encephalization-it is merely an upward displacement of a polygon. The points in brain:body space are not random deviations from a line; they represent best estimates for the species that provide data. The biological process that produces the points is a discrete process, only approximated by continuous func- tions, and the "finite mathematics" suitable for the analysis of the polygons may also be best for the biological correlates of the numbers on the graphs. The polygons provide more useful information about the nature of the relationship between brain and body size, in showing an array of points that presents information about diversity directly rather than in the form of a line with an assumed "normal" scatter of points about it. There is another positive side to the use of minimum convex polygons. The polygons can be analyzed with set-theoretical methods, which are usually used with more concern about the logic of their construction than the more familiar methods involving continuous functions. This dis- tinction is not as important for those very sophisticated with respect to mathematical methods, but the less sophisti- cated student can be helped to think more directly about the data and is less likely to be misled by the routine application of formulas and indices. Furthermore, by stating the problem first in terms of the polygons and then working from them to the more familiar linear systems, one begins with a simple true picture of the data and advances to other useful approximations. The advantage here is a psychological one, in bringing the scientist closer to the data while providing a significant amount of summarizing and analysis. To be able to visualize (and thus comprehend) one's data is an advantage not to be underestimated, and it is one that those concerned with multivariate methods have especially appreciated (Chernoff 1973). Evolutionary methods. The reviewers raise issues of within- versus between-species comparisons, of the evolutionary basis of brain shape and fissurization, and of the use of certain evolutionary principles. These are technical issues that were not considered in depth in the book, and I will comment on them only briefly here. Vol. 16 No. 3 September 1975 423</page><page sequence="22">When Doty points out that microcephaly implies that small-brained "hominids" (Homo sapiens would have been more accurate) could have been capable of speech, he is using within-species information for judgments about be- tween-species effects (see p. 428). Although as "experiments of nature" the data of such pathologies are often extremely important for the discovery of functional principles, they are distracting for the main theme of the evolutionary analysis. The apparent exceptions that they provide are in the role of outliers in statistical analyses, and we often have no way of dealing with them other than ignoring them. They are not even truly within-species measures, but form a separate population for analysis. At the present time I cannot deal with such data from an evolutionary point of view and certainly not in the context of between- species analysis. One valuable contribution, however, is to emphasize that in computing measures like EQ or NC the data must be typical for a species, and one cannot, at present, use these measures for within-species analysis (cf. Gould's review). Doty's discussion of microcephalics and the difficulties they present for an analysis based on species norms illus- trates the dilemma that one may face in the use of Rubicon models for the analysis of brain evolution. Count and Coon both refer to this issue, and it should be recognized that the true meaning of a Rubicon is a decision-criterion or rule. With respect to the brain, this has been of the form: 'a cranial capacity of x ml will be used to make the decision whether a particular hominid is to be classed, e.g., as sapient or nonsapient." Although such a rule may be biologically naive, it is a very respectable way of making scientific decisions. It would be more correct to apply the criterion to an assemblage of data, where an independent classifica- tion is available. Thus, one might take all of the pithe- canthropine data, determine a distribution for them, and do the same for a large sample of sapient data (cf. fig. 16.11). The statistics of these distributions might help one determine criteria for various grades of brain evolution. The problem is on the borderline of my analysis, and I do not regard it as adequately resolved. The idea of "chronospecies" as suggested by some writers seems to me to skirt the issue. Coon, Count, and King raise the question of the evolution of morphological traits such as sphericity or fissural patterns of the brain, and Count puts it into its critical form by questioning how this morphological information was deter- mined for evolutionary purposes. In my discussion I am almost Lamarckian in emphasizing the mechanical "advan- tages" of advanced adaptations: sphericity to maximize the volume and fissurization to maximize the cortical surface, or at least to fit the necessary surface onto the volume of the brain. There is, of course, no question that both shape and fissural pattern are genetically coded, but the step from the genetic code is as much a mystery for brain morphology as it is for all other morphological traits under genetic control. There is obviously no question about the genetic control, which is evident in the common patterns seen in large groups of mammals. There would be no errors in distinguishing a sample consisting of the brains of all known species of monkeys and apes from another sample drawn from the carnivores. Within the carnivores, one finds the least weasel's brain ratlike in size but with the characteristic fissures (in miniature) of most carnivores. The "law" that the degree of fissurization is a function of gross brain size is violated in this case (although the principle generally holds). The same genetic rule undoubt- edly holds for the general shape of the brain, and I have implied as much in my discussion of figure 1 of this reply. One is certaina that the evolutionary effect is on the genetic instructions. But the step from gene to structure is not yet understood in biology; it is not a problem unique to the evolving brain. In his summary of my analysis, Count mentions the principle of proper mass, which is presented as a principle of brain structure:function relations necessary to under- stand the evolutionary process. An equally important prin- ciple (p. 15) relates the direction of brain evolution and the adaptations controlled by the brain to the niche of the species. I have discussed this earlier in arguing the case of the role of ecological niche in the evolution of the olfactory bulbs. Several reviewers also noted the conservation principle, Count most ingeniously in his phrasing of it as "Nature is more interested in bestowing D-grades than A-grades." It is this principle that makes encephalization so odd a phenomenon. One seeks conservative explanations for early steps in the evolution of the brain to a new grade-the solution of a packaging problem is more conservative an idea than the discovery of a behavioral novelty, like "intelli- gence," as a method of coping with selection pressures. The idea that one sensory system in the brain evolves after the model of another sensory system (p. 410) is a version of the conservation principle, and may be helpful for understanding a number of common features of the sensory systems of living brains. All such principles have a comfortable 19th-century feeling about them. One of the challenges at present is to convert them into precisely stated hypotheses with precise predictions which meet the criterion of yet another modern cliche of science, that they be falsifiable. CONCLUDING REMARKS Although we (reviewers and author) may be a biased sample in that we were willing to make the effort to do the book, to read it, and to write about it, I think it is correct to see one item on which there is consensus: the problems addressed by the book are of major importance and have not been given their due before. Were I critic rather than author, I would have chosen a few other features to emphasize. Some of my criticisms of method would have been fairly picayune (too many "significant figures" in the data of table 16.3, etc.), and some of my broader criticisms might have been directed more toward the theory of intelligence and the concepts used to develop it. But on the whole I would have agreed with the reviewers on the major items. Was I presenting a black box, as Noback suggests? Not really. I do have one "flow chart" of information as it is channelled through the nervous system (fig. 12.2), but I count a total of twenty little boxes distributed among four bigger boxes, with the arrows drawn more carefully than many readers may realize to represent the actual points of communication. The nervous system has to be seen through a glass appropriate to the picture one needs, and for my analysis a twenty-box system was sufficient. I have seen equivalent charts showing the energy flow in a single neuron, and these too are "black boxes" at their level of analysis. Despite the consensus about the importance of the issues, there is some disagreement about how to approach them. Gould predicts that my book "is bound to inspire contro- versy," and some of this is already evident in several of the reviews, in particular those of Andrew and Radinsky. It is perhaps inevitable that arguments arise, because of the special commitments that one develops to a particular approach to one's data and to the canon of one's discipline. The arguments may be, in part, defenses of those commit- ments and not necessarily a rejection of the other view. But whatever their source, they may be a necessary part 424 C U RRE N T AN TH RO PO LOG Y</page><page sequence="23">Jerison: EVOLUTION OF THE BRAIN AND INTELLIGENCE of the development of a scientific field. Dispassionate science on fundamental issues is one of those fictions that we maintain in order to keep talking to one another. The strong positive evaluations of so many of the review- ers are due, I think, to the fact that the problem of the evolution of brain size was ready to be handled by modern statistical and scientific methods. There is a reasonable rationale for a psychologist's doing such work, because of the place of "intelligence" in the analysis. One must first see a problem as interesting before undertaking it. (It also helps to have a reasonably strong obsessive-compulsive streak-though I am not the kind of psychologist who can say much about such things.) By citing some of my nonevolutionary research in psychology, I tried to indicate the range of my interests. Those interests contributed in many ways that a casual reader might miss to the way I approached the problem. The style of thinking is, of course, special. But some of the methods of psychometrics and psychophysics, and of multivariate analysis, which are all part of the stock-in-trade of at least some research psychologists, could be applied almost unchanged to the question of brain size. I might note here, while writing in this personal way, that my interest in the problem as an approach to intelligence actually began when I read Lashley's presidential address to the American Society of Naturalists on "Persistent Problems in the Evolution of Mind" (see Jerison 1955). It was, therefore, appropriate in several ways to present the quotation from that address (Beach et al. 1960:463) on the first page of the book. The solution of the problem that I set for myself was not entirely satisfactory, in my judgment, because the analysis of intelligence has to advance beyond the conceptual stage into deeper and more critical experimental analyses. I cannot yet suggest better methods for testing animal intelligence than those now being used with uncertain success. But my analysis is clear enough, I think, to enable one to recognize a successful procedure when one is proposed. My guess is that this will require a combination of physiological and behavioral methods, to provide more information about what is going on inside the head. I cited Donchin et al. (1973) to suggest to this audience the kinds of measurements that might be available. One also needs to know where the eyes (and ears, and nose) are pointed, and what sort of information is coming into and out of the head. In these concluding remarks I have temporarily left the domain of fossils to look at the behavior of scientists and the status of otner living and behaving organisms. The book, though, was an integrative look at the fossil record, with a major part of the integration coming from the contribution to and from psychology rather than anthro- pology or ethology. As I wrote earlier, my aim as a psychologist was to understand better the nature of intelli- gence. The reviewers could not address themselves easily to that issue because it is largely refractory. It is difficult to decide how much progress was made in the book toward clarifying it. But it seems clear, from the tone of most of the reviews, that at least some progress can be recorded, perhaps less on the history of intelligence than on the history of and the forces that shaped its organ, the brain.
