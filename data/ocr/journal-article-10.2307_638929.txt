<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARIADNE'S FEARS FROM SEA AND SKY (OVID, HEROIDES 10.88. AND 95-8) In Ovid, Heroides 10.79ff. Ariadne starts to consider various dangers which to her mind threaten her life as that of any deserted woman (80). She lists some of these dangers in the following catalogue (83-8): lam iam venturos aut hac aut suspicor illac, qui lanient avido viscera dente lupos. Forsitan et fulvos tellus alat ista leones? Quis scit an et saevam tigrida Dia ferat?1 1 This seems to be the best emendation of this line; see Palmer's apparatus criticus (A. Palmer, P. Ovidii Nasonis Heroides [Oxford, 1898], ad loc.).</page><page sequence="2">SHORTER NOTES 555 Et freta dicuntur magnas expellere phocas; quis vetat et gladios per latus ire meum? Wolves (83f.), lions (85) and a tigress (86) serve as examples of wild animals on land; in line 87 Ariadne turns to the sea, expressing her fear of 'magnas ... phocas'. All commentators and nearly all scholars seem to agree that in line 88 she suddenly changes the topic and talks about human beings, probably pirates (Palmer).2 However, a reference to 'homines' would be rather odd here, especially because Ariadne stated before that there is no trace of other people: 'vacat insula cultu; non hominum video, non ego facta boum./ Omne latus terrae cingit mare; navita nusquam./ Nulla per ambiguas puppis itura vias' (59ff.). Accordingly, many scholars tend to delete line 88 and much more of the passage.3 Birt supposes a lacuna after 87, assuming the loss of a longer catalogue of sea-animals.4 I do not think that a whole catalogue is necessary here, but would like to suggest another solution: to translate 'gladius' with 'sword-fish'. The only scholar who to my knowledge considers this possibility is J. Gilbert,5 without, however, arriving at a decision and obviously without influencing later interpretations (probably because of his obscure place of publication). The sword-fish (gladius Gr. Lfd'aSg) is mentioned by Aristotle ;6 in Latin literature the elder Pliny knows about its ability to pierce even ships.7 The Encyclopaedia Britannica confirms that the swords of these fish 'are most formidable weapons of aggression. These fish never hesitate to attack whales and other cetaceans, and, by repeatedly stabbing them, generally retire from the combat victorious:... they follow the instinct so blindly that they not rarely assail boats and ships in a similar manner'.8 Thus the sword-fish makes good sense in the passage discussed here, and the couplet aptly rounds off the catalogue. Ariadne's immediately following statement, that she fears slavery even more than being killed by the animals mentioned before, appears to be much more comic. After this amusing climax Ariadne resumes pondering over possible threats (93-8): Si mare, si terras porrectaque litora vidi, multa mihi terrae, multa minantur aquae. Caelum restabat; timeo simulacra deorum; destituor rapidis praeda cibusque feris. Sive colunt habitantque viri, diffidimus illis; externos didici laesa timere viros. In line 95 she expresses her fear of 'simulacra deorum' (for the phrase cf. Met.1.73 'astra tenent caeleste solum formaeque deorum'). One may see here a non-technical and humorous comment on an issue discussed, for example, in Philodemus, De Dis: 'the idea that the sun and moon and certain other heavenly bodies each have an anthropomorphic god attached to them and occupying the same portion of space as they do' (P. G. Woodward, 'Star Gods in Philodemus', CEn. 19 (1989) 29-47, p. 29). 2 Palmer, op. cit. (n. 1), comm. ad loc.; for the whole passage, see, apart from Palmer's commentary, W. Schmitz-Cronenbroeck, Die Anfdnge der Heroiden des Ovid (diss. K61n, 1937), p. 25; G. Peters, Observationes ad P. Ovidii Nasonis Heroidum Epistulas (diss. Leipzig, 1882), pp. 28-30. ' For example Peters, op. cit. (n. 2), deletes 88, 93-5 and establishes the sequence 85-7, 96-8, 89-92; Schmitz-Cronenbroeck, op. cit. (n. 2), p. 25, ejects 86-95; Palmer, op. cit. (n. 2), inclines to eject 89-96. 4 Th. Birt, De Halieuticis Ovidio Poetae falso adscriptis (Berlin, 1878), p. 40. J5 . Gilbert in Jb der Fiirsten- u.

For the 'ferae', the constellation of K?770S comes first to mind, and Ovid himself depicts in his Metamorphoses the frightening appearance of other monsters when narrating the story of Phaethon: 'per insidias iter est formasque ferarum!/ utque viam teneas nulloque errore traharis,/ per tamen adversi gradieris cornua tauri/ Haemoniosque arcus violentique ora Leonis/ saevaque circuitu curvantem bracchia longo/ Scorpion' (Met. 2.78ff.). The 'homines', too, can be looked upon as inhabiting the sky, as there are many tales attributing human origin to figures in the sky, e.g. Perseus. Woodward (art. cit. p. 33) counts 34 human beings as being catasterized in Eratosthenes. Ariadne thus refers to animals and human beings in the sky, pointing out that she cannot trust 'externi viri' (98) after her experience with Theseus. 'Externus', which normally means 'coming from another country' (e.g. Prop. 1.2.20, Pelops and Hippodameia), is humorously extended to mean 'from another world'.
