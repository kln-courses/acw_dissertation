Its condi- tion is precisely that of the heavenly bodies in the system of Anaxa- goras; like these it is carried between the upper heaven and the earth by the vortex. It is a Pf8Aoq, a "clod" or "nugget," as well as a stone; this term and the derivation "from Olympus" make best sense if the phrase refers to the formation of the stone by agglomeration high above the earth. This corresponds to a possible interpretation of Anaxagoras' cosmogony: the heavenly bodies, owing to the greater coldness, congealed from earth particles at a point very far from the center of the cosmos (Earth); falling toward the center, they were sus- tained in their present positions by the centrifugal force of the IEarly allusions to the stone: Alcman 79 PMG, Alcaeus 365 PLF, Arch. 91.14-15 West, Pindar Is.

The passage thus raises a number of questions about Euripides' sources and inten- tions. Whether or not the body here described is the sun, the descrip- tion offers a strange mixture of science and mythology. Did Euripides spontaneously connect the myth of Tantalus with the theories of Anaxagoras, or had they already been linked? In Orestes, the effect of the juxtaposition is to magnify the sufferings of the Tantalids, apparently making them part of the cosmic order, but one naturally looks for a more tangible reason for connecting Tantalus' stone with a stone in.the Anaxagorean sky. Three other sources link Tantalus with Anaxagorean cosmology, but they may all be dependent on Euripides.3 In D.L. 2.3.8 the sum- mary of Anaxagoras' opinions begins o0ros EXEyE rbOvy '~Lto p'8pov EvaL 8ta'rvpoV KVa E/LEco - 7  7T InokrovvP'cov" oi 8 'OaaL TrTakov.

The difficulties of Anaxagorean cosmogony, however, are only marginally relevant here. General accounts of Anaxagorean cosmology are found in G. S. Kirk and J. E. Raven, The Presocratic Philosophers (Cambridge 1962) 382-385, 391-392, and W. K. C.

Eustathius' version is evidently an attempt to clarify the version of the Pindaric scholium.4 The story is identical, except that the sun no longer serves as the stone of Tantalus; instead the stone, with its gol- den chains, symbolizes the sun god, whom Tantalus has offended. The difficulty of having the sun both an angry god and a piece of inert matter is thus removed. The golden chains come, of course, from Euripides, and are interpreted in accordance with the allegorical identification of the "golden rope" of II. 8.18-25 with the sun, an allegorization found as early as Plato's Theaetetus 153c-d (to which Eustathius elsewhere explicitly refers).5 Diogenes Laertius also avoids self-contradiction by offering only Tantalus' opinion about the sun, without the story of his punishment. His report that "some" attri- buted Anaxagoras' most infamous belief to Tantalus surely rests on knowledge of the story found in the scholium; the unlikely image of Tantalus as a natural philosopher must be based on the identification of the stone with the sun. D.L.'s ultimate source could be the same commentary on Pindar from which the scholium is derived, and at any rate is not evidence for an independent tradition. Both he and Eus- tathius may be dependent on the Pindaric scholium; is the scholium independent of Euripides? The story given by the scholium is fundamentally self-contradictory, as Eustathius saw, for it requires that the sun be at once a god and a stone. It also seems somewhat confused: "About the sun the physi- cists say that the sun is called a stone" is not an easily intelligible expression. The scholiast seems to be using, besides the text of 4Examples of Eustathius' use of Pindar scholia in M. van der Valk, Eustathii commentarii ad Homeri Iliadem pertinentes I (Leiden 1971) XC. 511. 695.9ff.

The commentator on Euripides glosses the technical, Anaxagorean term p,'8pos, and the commentator on Pindar (who adopts the term) seems to confuse this gloss with the actual explication of Euripides. This bit of muddle confirms his dependence on Euripidean scholia and text, which together provide his description of the punishment of Tantalus. The only element in his note which is not to be found in this source is the one adopted by D.L., the identification of Tantalus' crime with the impious beliefs of Anaxa- goras. This could, however, be an extrapolation from the offense Euripides attributes to Tantalus, the possession of an arK6kactroS yXh~cora (10).6 Euripides is the first writer known to have defined the crime of Tantalus in this way, and while later authors repeat this vague formulation, it is not surprising that only in the three passages cited is this specified as the teaching of Anaxagorean doctrine.7 While by itself Euripides' description of Tantalus' offense would hardly sug- gest dabbling in physics, it could be taken this way in the light of Electra's monody. Euripides himself curiously mingles myth and sci- ence; it was only a step to make his Tantalus, associated with Anaxa- goras through the stone, a duplicate of Anaxagoras. While it cannot be proven that Euripides and commentaries on 982 of Orestes are the only sources, whether directly or through intermediaries, for the story as it appears in Sch. Pind. O0. 1.91a, there is certainly no need to assume such other sources. Euripides, once interpreted as alluding to Anaxagoras' theory of the sun, suffices to explain the Pindaric scho- 6F. Welcker, RM 10 (1856) 250-251, argued that this was actually Euri- pides' intended meaning; Euripides deliberately conflated the beliefs of the phy- sicists with those of their superstitious opponents. This is not impossible. C. W. Willink, "Prodikos, 'Meteorosophists,' and the Tantalos Paradigm," CQ 33 (1983) 25-33, in discussing the joke on Prodicus-as-Tantalus at Plato Prot. 513b-c, suggests that an equation of Prodicus and Tantalus predated Orestes. The Anaxagorean tendency of Orestes, however, seems very clear; if the joke has a special point, Plato may have substituted one famous atheist for another. Prodicus was not especially famous for his opinions about the sun but did apparently include the heavenly bodies in his theory of men's deification of the useful (Sex. Emp. ad. math. 9.18: 84 B5 D-K7). 7J. E. Hylen, De Tantalo (Uppsala 1896) 32-35, lists the numerous passages where his offense is said to have been an uncontrolled speech of some kind.</page><page sequence="5">Tantalus and Anaxagoras 17 lium, and the scholium in turn is sufficient origin for the remarks of Diogenes Laertius and Eustathius. Nevertheless, the later story, in showing in a clearer form the illogi- cality of Euripides' conception, offers some support for the possibility that Euripides did not invent his myth. He is, of course, capable of undermining the mythology on which his plots depend.8 In Phaethon, where Anaxagorean doctrine would be most disconcerting, since a fully anthropomorphic sun god is central to the plot, he calls the sun Xpvcrra fO3Ao' (fr. 5 Diggle, 782 N2). At least in Phaethon, however, the prominence of the sun could explain why Euripides' mind should have turned to contemporary astronomy. Tantalus, however, does not traditionally belong in the sky.9 The only reason imaginable for putting him between earth and heaven is the identification of his stone with a heavenly body. There are, therefore, two linked problems. If the myth of Tantalus had already been allegorized, Euripides was certainly capable of combining this allegorized, cosmological Tantalus with a traditional, mythical one. The problem, since no such allegory is extant, is to supply at least a plausible context for it, by showing how the allegorical elements in the Euripidean passage fit what is known about allegorization in the late fifth century. Second, whether or not a pre-existent allegory is involved, Euripides' skyborne Tantalus will 8There is a good discussion of Euripides' self-undercutting in A. L. Brown, "Wretched Tales of Poets: Euripides, 'Heracles' 1340-46," PCPS n.s. 24 (1978) 22-31. J. Diggle, Euripides: Phaethon (Cambridge 1970) 187, points out that D.L. 2.10 cites Euripides' phrase as Euripides' response to Anaxagoras' prediction of the Aegospotami meteorite (on which see below). This suggests either that Anaxagoras discussed the sun and the meteorite in close proximity, or that Euripides used the phrase for Phaethon's fall, which resembled that of a meteorite: in either case, it is evidence, though remote, for associating Euri- pides' use of Anaxagoras with the meteorite. 9Some later authors follow Euripides in putting Tantalus aloft; see Hylen (n. 7 above) 53. Athen. 7.781B refers to an epic, the 'ATrpELMV KaGoSo' (Nostoi fr. 10 Allen), for a version in which Tantalus wished to live like the gods and was punished by the gods with the stone, which prevents him from enjoying the fulfillment of his wish; whether this epic was identical with the Nostoi, in which Hades was described (fr. 3 Allen), is disputed. D. Comparetti, "Die Strafe des Tantalos nach Pindar," Philologus 32 (1873) 227-251, argues that the Nostoi, followed by Pindar, must have placed Tantalus on Olympus, amid the happiness of which the stone deprived him; U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Homerische Untersuchungen, Philol. Untersuchungen 7 (Berlin 1884) 157, 201-202, insists on a separate epic with a Tantalus in the air, in a symbolically mediate position between gods and men. There is no evidence either for Olympus (the idea is grotesque) or for Wilamowitz' grand but overintellectual image. Tantalus belongs only on Mt. Sipylus or in Hades.</page><page sequence="6">18 Ruth Scodel make more sense if a plausible link between the myth and the theory of Anaxagoras can be found, a reason for the association of ideas. A first step is to look more closely at Euripides' stone. That it is the sun is not certain; there are many stones aloft in Anaxagorean theory, some invisible to us.1' The identification with the sun found in the scholia is natural, given the particular fame of Anaxagoras' opin- ion about the sun, the parallel with Phaethon, and the brightness implied by the "golden chains," but it is not inevitable. The stone itself is not said to be golden, and the chains do not symbolize the sun itself, if the stone sun is attached to them. Their function is indeed somewhat obscure (so the evidently slightly perplexed scholiast on 982 comments El 8' &amp;pa 7.cvT G8taropotL irc2 r E' d?avEcu trpprlptrrvoq Ircpcl-o-Lv 0 jl-oW;, yLVCOOKETOO'aV OTL Ta' 4VlLK 0LTO^ yLv0LKO v KaTaxItyvvOwLv 6 Ei)pLdart8'). Since the chains attach the stone to the vortex, they should represent the centrifugal force that prevents the heavenly bodies from falling. They are golden perhaps because the brightness of the heavenly bodies is a result of the fric- tion of the bodies' movement. At the same time, they mark Euri- pides' use of Iliad 15.18-21. Here Zeus reminds Hera of how he once punished her: ?1 o0 I.LEL VY OTE T' e KpLWLO V1O6EV, E'K 8E rTOGOLLV aiK.ovath 7JKa8 go W, a rTEpu XEpl 8E g8E.LV t 'rlh7)a XpVioEov &amp;pp'qKTOV; OV 8) V v atG'pL KU vKi vEo'XLv EKpAOW ... Euripides' dependence here can hardly be doubted: not only are the golden chains and the heavenly locale found in both passages, but the context is similarly punitive." Homer's gold chains are literal chains, golden because objects con- nected with the gods are usually of gold, while those of Euripides represent physical forces. The Homeric chains, however, were also treated allegorically. In the standard allegorization of the Binding of Hera (ps.-Plutarch Vita 97, Heraclit. All. 40, Cornutus Theol. graeca 1059 A 46.6 D-K7.

I"So di Benedetto (n. 1 above) ad loc. Euripides was also probably influenced by II. 8.18-27 (see below), which is treated as his main source for the golden chains by L6v6que (n. 5 above) 19, and by N. J.

Empedocles named the four elements after gods (31 B6 D-K7): Zeus was fire (which would make him aether in a cosmology), NEstis water; whether Hera represented air and Aidoneus earth, or the reverse, was already a problem in antiquity.13 Diogenes of Apollonia identified Zeus with the aer of his theory, and claimed that Homer's poetry showed the same view (64 A8 D-K7, cf. Eur. Tro. 884-887 and the Derveni Papyrus XV.3-4, XIX.3). Euripides speaks of a divine aether in contexts showing Diogenes' influence (Diogenes does not contrast aer and aether): Helen 1015-16, Supp. 532-534 (cf. the Potidaea inscription IG 12 945.6 and Frogs 892).14 In frs. 839 and 941 N2 he explicitly identifies Zeus with aether. Hera's name is first positively given an etymology from &amp;ap by Plato, Crat. 404b-c, but she is interpreted as aer in Homeric allegories other than the Binding, including her inter- course with Zeus on Mt. Ida (Heraclit. All. 39.3-12) and the theomachy (Sch. B on II. 20.67 = Porphyry Quaest. Hom. II 240-241 Schrader), which is generally accepted to have been allegorized along physical lines by Theagenes of Rhegium in the sixth century.15 The binding of Hera must have been a pre-eminent candidate for allegori- cal treatment. It is easily converted to a physical allegory, and the myth it offers as its surface meaning is patently offensive (it was deleted by Zenodotus).16 Indeed, it is probably in origin a nature 12See F.

There is an admitted circularity in arguing that Euripides' apparent use of an allegorized interpretation of the Binding of Hera confirms that the interpretation already existed so that such use is possible, but there is at least plausibility in putting the allegory early, and his golden chains, like those of the allegorized Homer, represent a force that holds segments of the universe together. Euripides thus seems to have used an allegorized myth for this one detail. Allegorizing and rationalizing mythology were familiar pro- cedures by the late fifth century.'8 If more than the golden chains came from allegorized myth, the source would be the circle of Anaxa- goras, whose cosmology is the basis for Euripides' Tantalus. There is some evidence for Homeric and mythological interpretation by Anaxa- goras and those associated with him. Diogenes of Apollonia (64 A8 D-K7) praised Homer on the grounds that the poet's presentation of Zeus as omniscient showed that Homer recognized that Zeus and air were the same. Anaxagoras himself is said (D.L. 2.3.11 = 59 A 1.29-31 D-K7, citing Favorinus) to have been the first to show the Homeric poems as teaching virtue and justice. A few fragments indi- cate possible interpretations of the poems in accordance with physical theory: so he seems to have argued that water is called "black" at II. 16.161 because it is black by nature (A 91), and his explanation of the rainbow (B 19 = Sch. bT on II. 17.547) may have been designed to explain the passage where the scholiast cites it, since it refers to the rainbow as a sign of storm rather than an indication of storm's end. against the authenticity of both, while admitting that Zenodotus' objections were probably based on decorum rather than external evidence.

An allegory of the Tantalus myth from the "school" of Anaxagoras is not, therefore, unlikely. Serious fifth- century philosophers used allegorical methods, and the Derveni Papyrus reveals an only slightly later eclectic using Anaxagorean ingredients, among others, in his allegorical treatment of a poem of Orpheus.20 If we turn to the second problem posed by the monody, that of what connects the stone of Tantalus to the sky, the analogy seems obvious. Tantalus' punishment by the stone is his eternal fear lest it fall, and one of the most famous and conspicuous features of Anaxa- goras' theory was its explanation of meteorites. His name is prom- inently connected with the famed meteorite that fell near Aegospo- tami in 467, and he is actually said to have predicted its fall (59 A 11 and 12 D-K7). This probably means only that his theory allowed for the likelihood that stones would sometimes fall from the sky. It is possible, however, that the appearance of a comet (possibly Halley's) shortly before the fall led him to a lucky guess that the celestial bodies were in an unstable condition, making a meteorite fall likely.21 In any case, his discussion of the phenomenon was celebrated and central to his theory (Plut.

Only very rarely does a stone actually fall from the sky. The possibil- ity, however, is always present, and the myth of Tantalus is a natural analogy. If the myth of Tantalus was allegorized as a representation of meteorites, the next question is naturally how Tantalus himself was treated. While it is possible that only the stone was allegorized or used an analogy, Euripides' placement of him in the sky suggests that he represented something more elaborate than an Everyman afraid of the sky's falling. As a guess, Tantalus could have represented the earth. Anaxagoras adopted the theory of Anaximenes, in which the earth is held suspended in its position both by its weight, which keeps it in the center of the cosmos, and by the great masses of air both above and below it (59 A 42.3, 88, 89 D-K7).

While the earth is somewhat more stable than Tantalus' name would connote, the name is at least a possible tool. An identification of Tantalus with earth would make the allegory a reason- ably complete, if extremely oversimplified, image of the Anaxagorean world. If the stone is one of the Anaxagorean heavenly bodies, and a potential meteorite, the anxious victim over whose head the stone hangs should be the object of a meteorite's fall. Euripides probably based his image of Tantalus on an allegorical interpretation of the myth. Even if he did not find, but invented the "Anaxagorean" Tantalus, the originating link was probably the 22Hyln (n. 7 above) gives a list of attestations of the proverb, 28-32.</page><page sequence="11">Tantalus and Anaxagoras 23 similarity between the stone of Tantalus and a potential meteorite. Making again partially literal what had been allegorized, he added an element from another allegorized myth, the gold chains. These have no connection with Tantalus and indeed make no sense in a literal reading; if the stone is held by golden chains, Tantalus has nothing to fear. As representing the bonds between aether and air, however, they could easily be adapted for the bonds that hold the heavenly bodies in place, though these are not so secure as those symbolized in the Binding of Hera. Also in Euripides' mind may have been the similar golden rope of II. 8.18-27, by which Zeus threatens to attach earth and sea to Olympus and suspend them all.23 This image is not unlike the allegorized version of the Tantalus myth that seems to lie behind Euripides, with its emphasis on how all things hang suspended. There is one further possible source for Euripides' version in a vari- ant of the Binding of Hera, a variant that may help explain the gold chains. Sch. bT on II. 15.22 (and Eust. II. 1003.12) preserve two lines that are alternative to the present lines 22ff.: 7rpiV TOTE 8 7'' 0&amp;'rihv'a rTem8v, p{'b8pov; 8' Evi Tpo11, Kaf8f8akov, o6pa 7TEXOLTO Kal EOM o/LEVOLUL 7rvEca0aL.24 The scholiast adds that the local guides showed these anvils. These lines, acceptably Homeric apart from the un-epic word so often found in contexts of Anaxagorean cosmology, b'8poq, are undatable but fit the general pattern of fluidity in the early Homeric text, at its greatest when rhapsodic transmission was prevalent and disappearing after the middle of the second century B.C.25 The idea of the falling anvils resembles the image of Hes. Theog. 722, and the connection between these anvils and some presumably meteoric rocks in the Troad may be a survival of a belief that meteorites were thunderbolts.26 In any case, 23Leveque's Aurea catena Homeri (n. 5 above) describes the many and varied allegorizations of this passage; cf. Leaf (n. 16 above) ad loc.: "It is curious that this line . . . should have been made the base of all sorts of mystical interpreta- tion and esoteric myths from the earliest times." 24With Heyne's conjecture 7rrE6v for mss. 7roSov. 250n the variant version see Bolling (n. 16 above) 151-152, who, while regarding the entire passage as interpolated, prefers 21ab to the longer text; see also A. Ludwich, Aristarchs homerische Textkritik (Leipzig 1864) 384-385. 26See A. B. Cook, Zeus III (Cambridge 1940) 924-927. That this is the original meaning of &amp;KLtwv is supported by its IE cognates; see the articles in H. Frisk, Griechisches etymologisches Worterbuch (Heidelberg 1954), and F. Chantraine, Dictionnaire ?tymologique de la langue grecque I (Paris 1968). Contra M. L. West, Hesiod: Theogony (Oxford 1966) on 1. 722.</page><page sequence="12">24 Ruth Scodel this version of the Homeric passage, if treated allegorically or com- pared to the allegorization of the vulgate, would make Hera's anvils meteorites, whose fall coincides with the loosing of the golden chains. The variant of the Binding is thus even closer to Euripides than the vulgate. In sum, then: Euripides' Tantalus is suspended in air beneath a stone that is described as an Anaxagorean heavenly body because such bodies, held aloft by a balance of forces, may slip and fall like Tantalus' stone. Euripides represents this balance of forces with the golden chains attached to the stone; the golden chains are borrowed from Iliad 15, which had already been interpreted allegorically, and a variant version of which actually makes Hera's anvils meteorites. His evident borrowing from allegorical interpretation of Homer makes it more likely that the allegorical treatment of the stone of Tantalus was not his own invention but was created by one of the practitioners of allegorical interpretation from the school of Anaxagoras.
