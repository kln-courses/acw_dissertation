<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marc Bensimon The significance of eye imagery in the Renaissance from Bosch to Montaigne The eye, perhaps because it serves his most important sense, vision, occupies a significant place among the few essential symbols of man. During the period which extends roughly from 1470 to 1570, vi- suality takes on such importance that no artistic, literary, intel- lectual, or even musical activity can be discussed without reference to it. A few examples will illustrate some of the changes in attitude which occurred during the Renaissance not only with regard to the importance granted the eye, but also in vision's relation to man's other senses, to his fantasies, anxieties, and transcendental occu- pations, to his sense of space and, indirectly, time. I.-"Cave, cave, Deus videt," admonishes the legend of Hiero- nymus Bosch's Seven Deadly Sins, a tondo painted on the center of the famous table top, where the sins are housed in seven "man- sions" representing the eye of God and encircling the luminous iris of the All-Seeing divinity (fig. 1). Little can be added concerning the painting's possible hidden meanings, as, for example, the 128 rays of the iris in which some see evidence that Bosch belonged to a sect of heretics; but several simple observations can be made concerning this theme and its orchestration. Most obvious of course, is that the eye of an all-powerful God mirrors men's actions: should one look at the image of God, one will see the reflection of His creatures. The tondo is here a window open upon a spherically mirrored reality, an oculus like Botticelli's and Filippo Lippi's Madonnas. The caption's admonition, "Beware of the eye of God," contrasts ironically and somberly with the small scenes dramatically repre- senting man hopelessly sinning, the victim of his passions. Under the 266</page><page sequence="2">Marc Bensimon luminous eye of God, a tragic sense of uselessness and inescapability prevails. No heroic, willful attempt to confront reality appears here; there is rather a silent dialogue between lucidity and moral and physical dejection. Man is viewed as an object, just as in Villon's "Debate of the Heart with the Body," Saturnian melancholia is evoked as a possible excuse for self-devaluation and for the comedy of self-pity in which he prostrates himself. Man's daily gestures "in the home" or nearby appear equally absurd, vain, and guilt-ridden. The moral or didactic significance of this painting and its caption (which gives it its full meaning) is expressed in terms of space: the composition leads the viewer's eye in an endless circle. This motion around the "mansions" with the rays like so many spokes in the center conveys the implacable futility sensed when destiny is expe- rienced as a merry-go-round or, to use the symbol then current, the wheel of Fortune. I It should, however, be noted that the painting itself does not represent the illusion of movement nor give to the mind the sense of a chronological sequence of events or a "moment" arrested in time, which would evoke the preceding or following moments. One can thus talk of a "scenic," "static" representation. Yet, while the eye with its plastic representation implies a visual apprehension of reality, consciousness when viewing it must resort to mental motion as if this were the only way to transcend the dra- matic spectacle of the human condition. Consciousness links together the heterogeneity of life's events through ceaseless circular movement. One is thereby constantly brought back to the point of origin. The mind adopts a transcendental and englobing perspective to find, perhaps, the center, the unity of being it yearns for. Oneness, absolute, is also the goal of Bosch's contemporary, Nicholas Cusanus, whose thought E. Cassirer singled out as the focal point of quattrocento philosophical efforts. Cusanus defines oneness as the ultimate, unattainable "coincidence of opposites" where the 1 Cf. the central position of the wheels of Bosch's Hay Wagon of Life; cf. also Cusanus: Movement ("the connexion between form and matter") is compared to "an intermediate spirit" called "atropos, clotho, and lachesis." 267</page><page sequence="3">Yale French Studies absolute minimum equates the absolute maximum, where the triangle becomes a circle, where the trinity becomes unity, and when move- ment and repose become synonymous. In this abstract, mathematical world, notions of time and space seem vain. Visual representations should have no place. To be sure, there are geometric figures in his work, and he does allude to the earth, sun, and stars. Yet their use, as will be seen, is subordinate to a very special attitude, a movement of the thought itself. This dynamic mental process is the only means by which Cusanus can transcend a reality conceived in terms of irreconcilable opposites. Relationship is the term which constantly recurs under his pen, not watch, split, or oppose, but link (relatio, nexus). Consciousness thus becomes aware of its own secretions, its own thinking processes of forming relationships. Cusanus' perpetual quest is best expressed by the circle or sphere which, like the snake of time biting its own tail, evokes an eternal round, a merry-go-round similar to the mental process involved in his imaginary attempts to square the circle (a favorite pastime of his) 2 or to reconcile opposites: "The circle is the perfect figure of unity and simplicity.... This unity is infinite like the infinite circle... and its duration is so perfectly one that the past is ... but the future .... In effect, so large are the contents of the beginning itself that the end is its beginning." 3 The very structure of this thought suggests a circular path. One of the best examples of this process is, of course, the analogy of the polygon within a circle. This static figure has no meaning unless one imagines the motion caused by increasing the sides of the polygon. Even if infinitely mul- tiplied, they will never coincide with the circle. It is obvious that with such a dynamic concept, Cusanus could not accept a static view of mystic fusion in the restful bosom of God. 4 God is unknowable, save 2 Cf. Gaston Bachelard's comments on the "Jonas complex": "Whoever draws a circle is dreaming... of a womb; whoever draws in it a square, giving it symbolic value, is building a shelter...." in La Terre et les reveries du repos (Paris, 1948), p. 148 ff.

Theos is only the name of God-as-an-object-of-quest by man; yet this name suggests to the seeker a "method": "Theos comes ... from The'ore6 or from Theo, i. e., from the Greek verbs contemplate and run. He who seeks must indeed run by means of sight in order to be able to reach the Theos in the vision of all things." 5 Another image which deeply fascinated Cusanus as an analogy to "edify" his "brothers" is a portrait by a contemporary, Roger de la Pasture which he describes at great length in his De Visione Dei. This portrait is unfortunately only preserved as a copy on tapestry in the Berne museum. According to Cusanus, the All-Seeing One on this painting had the extraordinary ability of seeming to focus his gaze upon the onlooker regardless of the latter's position in the room. Should he move about, the gaze would follow him and "he will be astonished when he realizes that this motionless gaze was moving, and his imagination will not be able to comprehend how the gaze can at the same time be in a different motion." 6 Cusanus goes on to describe the ultimate qualities of the vision of the Omnipresent. He states explicitly that to see this hidden God is to be seen by Him. The same mirroring relation found in Bosch's tondo emerges: "By seeing me You enable me to see You, You who are a Hidden God.... To see you is but to be seen by You.... You tend to show Yourself to those who seek You, for Your eyes are open and never turn away from them.... Should I wander off, You allow me to have Your gaze upon me." 7 Further, Cusanus conceives of his life as a "voyage" with God as a "faithful companion." There again, sight and motion are inti- mately connected: "Wherever I turn my steps, I am always before You. Now, to see and to move are in You one and the same. You move with me, and You are in continual motion when I walk." 8 It is clear that when sight is used by Cusanus and perhaps Bosch to support mental and spiritual speculation, it signifies motion.

While there is no doubt as far as the history of ideas is concerned that the two philosophers are closely associated, it must be admitted, as Cassirer himself later recognized, that Cusanus' influence on the Florentine Academy was not as great as he had held. The De Docta Ignorantia and Theologia Platonica differ in spirit as well as in form and contents. Fundamentally, Cusanus spirals up freely from relationship to relationship towards the inaccessible. The physical universe and the world of geometry are mentioned and used chiefly as a point of departure for his abstract, ever-moving thought. Ficino's thought, on the other hand, presents a series of different facets, of new analogies which, though clear and most symmetrical in themselves, complete or halt the progression of thought. 10 Essentials can be distinguished only with difficulty from the multiplicity of minute details. Ficino's world is ordered symmetrically and hierarchically. To the twelve souls of the spheres (eight for the planets and four for the elements) corresponds a spatial hierarchy of beings: first comes matter, or the body, multiple and divisible; then the soul, mobile and indivisible; higher, the angels, immobile and divisible. Finally over the whole edifice rules God, immobile and indivisible. He corresponds to the single soul of the universe. Obviously, reality here is quantita- tive; space ordered anagogically and antithetically, e.g., division vs. oneness, motion vs. immobility, is indispensable to this system. One cannot sufficiently emphasize the importance of separation, of schism for the imagination of the XVIth century man and his relation to the cosmos. The notion of duality, of separation, is of course inherent to all Platonic epistemology; but more than an intellectual concept, with its practical spatial application-symmetry-it becomes a deep- seated irrational mode of confronting reality, as we shall see below. In 9 Ibid., p. 381. 10 Cf. Paul 0. Kristeller, Renaissance Thought (New York, 1961), p. 16. 270</page><page sequence="6">Marc Bensimon Ficino, imagination wanders up and down a timeless scale ordered with metaphysical language; it expands quantitatively. Quantitative space notions also dominate moral yearnings. As- trology plays a leading role, giving, so to speak, a "psychological face" to the planets and constellations and serving as a mirror of conscious and unconscious aspirations and conflicts. Further, the cosmos is interiorized just as much as consciousness "travels" in space: "Totum in nobis est coelum," Ficino claims. Purification rites, worship of the sun and light (where darkness reigns, the eye cannot penetrate), elevation, mountains, flying imagery, the cult of white, gold, angels, etc., are often summoned as though they were magical: "Seek yourself outside of the universe.... To find yourself,... fly yonder, and what's more, look yonder. For when you're yonder, you embrace all things with a glance." 11 An attribute of the Supreme Being, ubiquity or rather omni- presence, which in its strict sense means the desire not only to be present everywhere but to be there at the same time, is the ultimate sought here. The real problem is, perhaps, Time, but it is cleverly masked by the illusions of Space. One can venture that whereas formerly consciousness of time passing had been translated into a circular, rhythmic motion, it is now transformed into spatial per- spectives. Witness the vogue of astronomical clocks showing the movement of the planets and the signs of the zodiac, etc., although it must be recalled that Time, or rather Death, is still present (e.g., Strasbourg's astronomical clock where Death strikes the hour with a femur). Music also underwent a similar and significant change in conception, as Lowinski's excellent commentaries on the expansion of tonal space in the "Concept of Physical and Musical Space in the Renaissance" 12 describe. Naturally, music happens in time; but Leonardo notes, for example, that music is "inferior" because it is "harmony in duration" rather than harmony "unraveling" in space. He seeks simultaneity of perception, a "harmonic view of the whole" 11 The'ologie platonicienne, Md. Raymond Marcel (Paris, 1964), I, p. 227. Cf. Andre Chastel, Marcel Ficin et l'art (Geneva, 1954); Art et humanisme a Florence (Paris, 1961), especially his admirable chapter on images, p. 195 ff. 12 Papers of the Association of the American Musicological Society, 1941. 271</page><page sequence="7">Yale French Studies which can be seen "simultaneously, at one glance." Yet, with the vogue of Neo-Pythagorean philosophy, "mundana" (cosmic) music had become fashionable; the movement of the spheres was resounding in space while new "commensurable intervals" were being explored. That the Renaissance was a "noisy age" is indisputable; yet, as Chastel remarks, Febvre is wrong in claiming that Renaissance men were "governed much more by hearing than by sight because of the intensity of their emotional reactions." 13 The basis for the error, as Chastel defines it, is the fact that sight is regarded as "the intellectual sense" and the others, especially hearing, as emotive. From a psychological viewpoint, voyeurism, sadism, and other "intellectual" distant pleasures seemingly devoid of feelings can actually be dictated by or give rise to intense emotion. In effect, some of the activities of the imagination described above, while "intellectual," are motivated by deep irrational forces. It should be noted, however, that during the second half of the XVIth century hearing and the other senses at least equalled or even surpassed vision in importance; and melodic music progressively replaced the canons and polyphonic orchestration. To come back to Ficino, the following statement can hardly be called "intellectual": "Imagine that your mind grows to the point of occupying your whole body,... that the various limbs have disappeared, and that your whole body is but an eye.... It will receive a greater abundance of light; it will embrace all things at one glance; ... it will see them all together equally without moving." 14 The cosmos comes under the power of this single eye which takes on a Cyclopean proportion. Man here is not under the eye of God; he is God, omnipresent. Simultaneity and quantitativeness, visibility or immanence supplant then the realm of abstraction and transcen- dence. The invisible or infinite world, once yearned for, disappears under or is reduced to visible, symmetrical, or antithetical schemes of conquest and possession. This attitude is true in fact for Ficino and for many ideal models, theories, hypotheses in art, politics, science, and religion in the XVIth 13 Chastel, The Crisis of the Renaissance (1520-1600) (Geneva, 1968), p. 34. 14 'd. R. Marcel, I, vi, p. 69. 272</page><page sequence="8">Marc Bensimon century, especially systems which "embrace the wind," as Montaigne will note. It may appear paradoxical to speak in the same breath of Ficino and Calvin (or Luther); yet, recent scholarship destroys the older notion of a glorious pagan Renaissance of which austere theologies would be but the counterpart. 15 Without alluding to the intellectual or spiritual contents of Calvinistic or Lutheran doctrine, one may easily conclude from their rigorous code of ethics that self-humiliation does not exclude Promethean aspirations. With the notion that failure signifies not being among the elect, the moral self is mobilized to conform to an austere pattern. Stiffness of will parallels other heroic attitudes of the age. An enraged Luther will call to arms: "The hour of the sword has come." An intransigeant Calvin will also take up his pen to fight the real foe: the spiritual libertine, not, as one might think, the Catholic. Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion is filled with images concerning the eye and allusions to the sun. He blends a feeling for infinity and simultaneity. He speaks of the "multiplicity of stars" and marvels how they could have been created "in one moment." A long account of the greatness of God is particularly relevant in this concern: it describes the relativity of whiteness: Just as the eye, which only sees black things, decides that what is actually of a dark-whitish color or else half-grey is the whitest thing in the world, ... for if we look on the ground or if we contemplate the things around us, we are convinced that our sight is firm and clear; but, should we raise our eyes straight towards the sun, the power exercised by our sight on this earth is confounded and dazzled by such a great light ... that we must admit our good sight is weak and feeble to look at the sun. Thus it is with our intellectual faculties: ...what pleased us before under the color of justice will seem to be soiled with very great iniquity; ...what deceived us miraculously in Wisdom's shadow will show itself to be extreme madness. 16 This passage summarizes many of the aspects of the theme we have been describing: the eye, space, whiteness, the sun, dualistic or antithetical modes. The latter process is also somewhat disquieting: 15 Cf. J. Boisset, Erasme et Luther, libre ou serf-arbitre (Paris, 1962). 16 Ed. Pannier (Paris: 1936), I, p. 41 ff. 273</page><page sequence="9">Yale French Studies there may be mention of this "beautiful masterpiece of the universe" which can be contemplated at one glance in its length and width, but aside from this one infallible "mirror," God is invisible. Closer to Calvin both chronologically and intellectually than is usually realized is St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order. With his Spiritual Exercises (1540) codified devotion reaches its peak. His voluntarism is also expressed, not by a sword but by the principle of obedience "like a stick in the hand of an old man," or by the motto "contemplation in action," which signifies a fusion of sight and action. To be sure, Loyola continues a mystic tradition familiar to him. The Flemish Mombaer had already utilized visual disciplinary devotions to encourage prayer, witness the use of a chiropsalterium or psalmodic hand or that of a cantichordium where each musical note corresponded to a vowel. What also occurs in the Renaissance is that thought itself and memory, as Yates showed, become dependent on spatial points of reference (loci and imagines). Cusanus uses the portrait of the All- Seeing for didactic spiritual purposes, yet with Loyola these exercises acquire special importance: for him, abstract concepts are to be visualized. Actual places must be seen with the eye of the imagination: "Viendo el lugar," as he puts it. The composicion de lugar, or composition of place, allows one to summon to the imagination, by means of each of the five senses, Hell, Paradise, or Eternity. Consciousness then finds in the visualization of eternity a means of satisfying temporal preoccupations. Later Saint Theresa of Avila will insist upon the importance of visualizing every word of a prayer, complaining that all too often a recitation degenerates into a mechanical ritual. "If you recite 'Our Father, which art in Heaven,' visualize the Father, the Heavens.. ." she admonishes her disciple. Another means of visualizing abstractions is naturally to project them onto the innumerable figures of the classic Pantheon. The interest in the Androgyne, for example, is most noteworthy because it signifies a visual and symmetrical response to an abstract concept. The yearning for the Golden Age of the Creation, for Oneness, for Love is expressed not by abstract and dynamic thought, not by a 274</page><page sequence="10">Marc Bensimon linear vision of pre-historic ages, but by the magical evocation of this symmetrical, bisexual figure. By its presence, it negates time and chronological thought. While the Androgyne is a symbol of predilec- tion, similar fascination was exercised by all of Antiquity and its mythology on the minds of Renaissance painters and poets. A few examples suffice: Antoine Heroet's poem L'Androgyne, Ronsard's "Ode a Michel de l'Hospital," one of his most famous, which describes at length Mount Olympus with its gods, and Antoine Caron's paintings, bizarre settings which mask an absence of concern for linear historical order, past and future. Another symmetrical symbol offered as substitute to deify this abstract concept-one's relation to past and future time-is Janus, a favorite of the Renaissance. This solar god and god of war gazes simultaneously at past and future. Thus, the real concern-that of Time-is suppressed, externalized as it is in space. Further, the symmetry of his twin heads expresses the ambivalent, antithetical forms given the conflict. Seen in this light, the remarks made by Carolus Bovillus, whom Cassirer calls one of the most "curious and characteristic products of Renaissance philosophy," acquire new dimension. This disciple of Lefevre d'Etaples (indirectly influenced also by Cusanus and the Platonic Academies) strives to show man as being not just a part of the universe, but a mirror, an eye. Yet he not only receives images but shapes them too. Further, Bovillus asserts that while reason is the power used by Nature to return cyclically to itself, once the initial severance has occurred, real unity of self can only be achieved schizogenetically, that is, when the ego divides itself into two parts and reconstitutes itself through this division. Splitting is thus the way to subsequent unity (De Sapiente, 1509). 17 Argus is another favorite in the Renaissance; he is sometimes called bifrons and represented with two heads. He can see behind his back; thus, he symbolizes in a very specific way a negation of the oneiric. Daylight and action typify his domain (like Hercules, he 17 Cf. Ernst Cassirer, The Individual and the Cosmos (Oxford, 1963), p. 89 ff. 275</page><page sequence="11">Yale French Studies is an invincible giant); but this all-seeing divinity (Panoptes) depends for his strength on his state of wakefulness since he must be charmed to sleep to be slain. Sleep and darkness are here synonymous with death, a common enough Virgilian view but one which Renaissance poets will not forget. In Pintoricchio's painting (fig. 2), Hermes is lulling Argus, the keeper of the nymph Jo metamorphosed into a cow, to sleep. The scene recalls in its peacefulness a pastoral from Sannazaro's Arcadia. The symmetry of the composition is emphasized by a forked tree. Situated in the middle of the painting, the tree expresses plastically the conflict between the forces of nature (Hera) and of Jupiter, the supreme power. But victory, it must be noted, can only come about through deceit. The sword in the corner of the painting suggests deceptive calm. The episode portrays a moment last- ing in time, "the lulling of Argus," and the consequential death of Argus is only intimated. Thus again chronology is subordinated to space and to the plastic representation. It suffices to contrast Ru- bens' versions of the same theme (Dresden) and (Antwerp, fig. 3) to grasp the different relation to chronology and to reality. Rubens' Hermes has just drawn his sword and his body and arm are ready to plunge it into Argus's slumbering form sprawled against a tree. The assymetrical baroque composition enhances the dynamism of the ac- tion and its imminent violence, thus rendering pictorially the narra- tive element. Moreover, the symbolism of Argus's loss of power, or the triumph of the oneiric (or of blindness and death), is further emphasized by the fact that Argus has lost his monstruous attributes: he has but two eyes. Pintoricchio's Argus, on the other hand, has a body completely covered with eyes (fig. 2a). No less than Ficino's evocation of the limbless creature metamorphosed into a gigantic eye, the sight of an anthropomorphic Argus with a hundred eyes antagonizes the mind, which rebels when confronted with a human figure covered with apertures suggesting the lips of as many wounds. Does the artificiality of the treatment, its lack of integration, not suggest the factitious nature of the mythical experience? Does its ludic nature not indicate that the symbol has become an object of fascination in itself? 276</page><page sequence="12">Marc Bensimon This hypothesis explains perhaps the vogue of poetic games and contests. In some of them, indeed, as in the Blasons du corps feminin, a part of the body of a lady is isolated. Poets thus laud the attributes of an eye, eyebrow, mouth, or breast by repeated analogies. Obviously the eye, symbolizing as it does love, is the gate to the soul and a choice object of worship. These esthetic constructions express distance and alienation rather than intimate possession. For Saint-Gelais, for example, the eye of the lady is synonymous with the sun, and the poet's soul becomes nature; the forty lines of the poem describe the power of this solar goddess to regulate in the poet's soul the various seasons with their prevailing meteorological conditions. The multiplicity of visual images in this poem obviously destroys somewhat narcissistically the object it wants to capture, and this regardless of the effect of the incantations: CEil, non pas ceil, mais un Soleil dor6. CEil comme Dieu de mes yeux honnore. CEil qui feroit de son assiete et taille Durer dix ans encor une bataille. CEil me privant du regard qu'il me doibt Me voyant mieulx que s'il me regardoit. CEil sans lequel mon corps est inutile. CEil par lequel mon ame se distille. ................................................... CEil bel et net comme ciel azure. 18 What the poet captured is surface, not depth, just like the painters or even, for that matter, the alchemists, whose complicated and secret formulas mask an essential alienation from inner reality. Their anxious scrutiny wanders from surface to surface apprehending reality from without, from the "tip of the eyes," so to speak. It never focuses on an organic center or establishes intimacy with it. 18 Antoine Herodt, "Blason de l'ceil," in Albert-Marie Schmidt, Poe'tes du XVIe siecle (Paris, 1953), pp. 311-312. "Eye, not an eye, but a golden sun. / Eye, like God, by my eyes honored. / Eye which could with its position and shape / For ten years more cause a battle to last. / Eye depriving me of the glance owed me / Seeing me better than were it looking at me. / Eye without which my body is useless. / Eye through which my soul is distilled. / .... / Eye beautiful and clear like the azure sky." 277</page><page sequence="13">Yale French Studies One is reminded of the intricate and bizarre cubistic figures of Direr. In his Geometria (fig. 5), Lorenz Stber gives reality such a geometric and abstract quality that it no longer represents any object at all; rather it becomes an object. The surfaces of walls and ceilings are invaded by grotesques and ornamentation which-though clearly defined, symmetrical, and geometric-have no focal point (fig. 4). The eye cannot rest or make distinctions between object and background. This "mad vitality," as Chastel puts it, rejects depth from which it is alienated. Alienation from depth or from certain feelings is in effect synonymous with the desire to possess not only space with the eye but also, by implication, nature and time. Travel leads to a form of exile. One could venture to say that, in the Renaissance, exile-whether voluntary or not-was fashionable. Geographical alienation is rendered by Rabelais when he isolates various ways of life on so many islands. Social and even psychological alienation are frequent among poets and artists of the Renaissance although the tendency is to "normalize" folly by generalizing and internalizing more and more: exorcism wanes as madness is no longer conceived in terms of outside demons who enter the soul to possess it. 19 Witch burning and torture do not cease, however, and obsession with death which accompanies alienation takes on the special form of having to see beneath the flesh, through it. If the fascination with anatomical dissection which in fact developed during this period must be called accidental, it can at least be said that those illustrations which "map" the human body take on as fantastic an appearance as the contemporary navigators' surface representations of the earth (fig. 6). Even the hereafter is visualized in what is considered one of the masterpieces of French Renaissance sculpture: Ligier Richier's standing figure which is but a view of bone through flesh. It shows as late as 1544 (almost 100 years after Villon) Rene de Chalons' desire to be portrayed, not as he appeared peacefully on his deathbed, but as he would look three years hence with the bones through his decayed flesh. 19 Cf. Michael Foucault, Histoire de la folie (Paris, 1961). 278</page><page sequence="14">Marc Bensimon It could be objected that anatomical dissection also served life. This is true, but it is coincidence that the scalpel is the instrument of the miracles performed on human life by Ambroise Pare, one of his- tory's most famous surgeons. That he devised new medical instruments and methods to remove cataracts comes as no surprise. Indeed, in addition to his accomplishments as a pioneer oculist, Pare is known also for practising plastic surgery. For the facial symmetry of those who have lost an eye he suggests "another eye artificially made of gold or silver, counterfeited and enamelled, so that it may seem to have the brightness or gemmie decencie of the naturall eye." Thus the eye is everywhere present in the enterprises of Renais- sance man. It would indeed be an endless task to analyse, for example, all the montages of contemporary love imagery and psychological discourse where the eye plays a dominant role, both in veneration of the lady from afar and in the lover's submission to her lethal gaze, so prevalent in Platonic and Petrarchean verse. This activity is usually rather narcissistic, for the poet does not really see the lady whose charms he supposedly wishes to praise. One of the first poems of his Delie presents a summary of Maurice Sceve's situation: L'ceil trop ardent en mes jeunes erreurs Girouettoit, mal cault, a l'impourveue: Voicy-o paour d'agreables terreurs !- Mon Basilisque avec sa poignant'veue Percant Corps, Cceur, et Raison despourveue, Vint penetrer en l'Ame de mon Ame. Grand fut le coup, qui sans tranchante lame Fait que, vivant le corps, l'Esprit desvie, Piteuse hostie au conspect de toy, Dame, Constituee Idole de ma vie.20 The poet's eye has no specific direction (girouettoit 'was turning like a weathervane'). The glance of the beloved, like that of the sight of 20 "My eye, too ardent in errors of youth, / Moved freely about, hardly prudent, unawares: / Behold-O delightful fear of fears! / My love's gripping sight, like a Basilisk / Piercing Body, Heart, and Reason destitute, I Penetrated into my very soul. I Hard was the blow which, though no sharp- edged blade, / Makes, the body still alive, the Spirit lifeless, / Pitiable offering before the sight of thee, 0 my Lady, / Now become the Idol of my life." 279</page><page sequence="15">Yale French Studies the Medusa, transforms the lover into a petrified worshipper of his lady. The latter, despite allusions to the moon, is a solar divinity. Here she is identified also with a mythical snake whose sight is lethal. As if those symbols did not suffice, her glance is also compared to a penetrating sword. As already suggested, there is indeed a relation between possession with the eye, distance, and sadistic activities, especially when the sword is involved. The cruel imagery in Sceve's poem, by no means exceptional, arises in the context of an idealized love. The same cruelty occurs in its natural counterpart, sadism, voyeurism, necrophilia, for example, which flourish in misogynic works of this period. These two extremes are frequently juxtaposed in Marguerite de Navarre's ambivalent Heptameron. Witness, as a product of idle travelers' imagination, the story of a valet who fancied he could obtain by force the favors of the lady of the house and who stabbed her some 20 times in the kidneys before raping her. The whole episode was, of course, viewed by a child hidden under a bed. In its realistic dimension, M. de Navarre's work mirrors the two attitudes of her contemporaries toward women: idealization and debasement. Ample evidence can also be found in literature and art of growing fears of succumbing to the domination of the opposite sex. Women are portrayed sword in hand, whether they are Amazonians, well-armed virgins, priestesses, or witches; whether they are Judith (fig. 7), Salome, or Delilah. There is also Alexander's mistress who humiliates Aristotle as in a XVIth century representa- tion of the old fabliau (fig. 8); and again Mad Meg, moving about sword in hand (fig. 9), towering completely out of proportion with the other figures: the incarnation of elemental malevolence. It is beyond the scope of the present study to discuss one of the favorite myths of the Renaissance, cosmic flight. Mention should be made, however, of the desire to kick the earth with one's heel and soar to view it in "monarchical contemplation." This wish is directly connected with the eye and space. Imagination and drugs like aconite or other "flying ointments" may be responsible for the cult of flying which was in such vogue among Renaissance witches. Indeed, in 280</page><page sequence="16">Marc Bensimon some courts it was debated whether flying to the sabbat constituted a greater offense than merely walking to it. "It was reported that witches attending the larger assemblies sometimes darkened the sky as they passed overhead." Participation of the learned in such practises is difficult to assess. It is nevertheless true that Ficino's theories on divine rapture and contemplation of the spheres and heavenly regions were often used not only by his disciples such as Nesi in his poema-visione, but also by French poets who exploited the theme of ascension through love and strongly emphasized contemplation of the cosmos in their love sonnets. Towards the 1550's interest in France seems to shift towards cosmic literature: hymns and poems expose scientific knowledge, especially meteoro- logical phenomena, one of the main pastimes of the XVIth century. For example, in his Amours des Amours, Second Part, Peletier du Mans finds satisfaction in contemplating the sky from above, thus understanding fully the causes of lightening, hail, rain, and frost, for which he gives detailed lyric explanations. As early as 1551, Ronsard himself gives Queen Marguerite of Navarre's body the same honor Ovid had given Caesar: she is trans- formed into a star and thus allowed to continue contemplating Fran- ce. Her soul, however, returns to take its place near God. Unlike us, "poor and weak" without knowledge of our birthplace, she can see the earth below and know the causes of cosmic phenomena. This is her ultimate felicity, her final and eternal reward. Happiness here seems to be equated with rational knowledge and understanding of the cosmos. We can thus understand the popularity enjoyed by Macrobius' commentary on the Dream of Scipio in the XVIth century. Ronsard indeed drew on Macrobian tradition for his lines on the cosmic voyage undertaken by the soul when it leaves the body (during sleep) to "learn all the secrets of the heavens including how lightening is made, as well as the clouds, hail, frost, etc." It is not specified whether these aerial dreams were physically induced or poetic fictions. In any case, little room is left for fusion with a God of Love. Rather, this intellectual program implies distance, possession with the eye. Personifying Philosophy in a hymn of praise, Ronsard 281</page><page sequence="17">Yale French Studies describes her as she who "spies on the nature of the Great God," who can with one "single clever glance" grasp the whole endless expanse of sky. Just as a witch pulls down the moon with her charms, he says, philosophy brings the sky to earth and places it in our hands like a toy. Here also, Ronsard lingers on the merits of a philosophy which was able to discover the secrets of nature, particularly those concerning the weather. In another hymn there is mention of the holy life of philosophers who can chase flatterers from the king's table. To illustrate this, Ronsard evokes with beautiful imagery the combat-by sword-of the winged, golden-haired twin sons of Boreus against the flying Harpies trying to starve poor Phineus, hungry and blind. III.-In the early 1550's DuBellay had proclaimed a new poetry and had called language written in a "higher and better style" the "wings" of heavenly immortality. Only three years after the publica- tion of Ronsard's quasi-epic hymns, he presents in his Regrets (1558) a collection of mournful sonnets expressing plaintively a new form of melancholia and dissatisfaction. Heroic defiance of Fortune, im- mortal glory, cosmic exploration are now no longer valid for the poet. His frequent poetic use of terms like now, no longer indicates real changes. DuBellay conceives of present reality as a series of unpleasant, incoherent, insignificant events. They are experienced passively or suffered. Past activities have been rejected. The future is far away, both in time and space. As for Antiquity and its heroic mythology with figures like Perseus who dared to kill the Medusa, Hercules, the twins, and others "formerly" so heroic in love and war, its evocation only serves to magnify his own shortcomings, to "make the problems more real" in "love's games." Elsewhere, com- paring himself to Ulysses and other heroes, DuBellay deplores his own vulnerability. He chooses to identify not with the twin heroes but rather with blind Phineus and deplores not having someone to chase the Harpies. Qui chassera de moy ces Harpyes friandes? Qui volera pour moy encor' un coup aux Cieux 282</page><page sequence="18">Marc Bensimon Pour rapporter mon sens et me rendre mes yeux? Et qui fera qu'en paix je mange mes viandes? 21 The tone differs radically from Ronsard's triumphant hymn of "Calays et Zethes." In a corrupt and decadent Italy which bears little resemblance to the ideals forged by enthusiastic French humanists and whose ruins are no longer viewed with the interest of an archeologist but as a sign of decay, DuBellay, voluntarily exiled, yearns with nostalgia for his parents' home. The suffering and frustrated traveler is like the mariner who "as his only treasure brings back herrings instead of gold ingots." He lives his alienation in two modes: temporal and spatial. Around 1558 in The Fall of Icarus, Bruegel expressed in a coherent and harmonious "semi-natural" landscape a mosaic of elements belonging to different times and places: a XVIth century ploughman, a rocky Mediterranean coast, imaginary mountains, a caravelle, Icarus, etc. A sense of organic unity between man and nature is conveyed to the estranged viewer through the plastic quality of the painting itself, its rhythm, and especially the subject in the foreground: a man of the earth. Antithetical to this is the presentation of a Lilliputian Icarus whose ambitious flight is no longer placed high on the scale of values and whose fall goes indeed unnoticed, as Auden said so beautifully in his "Musee des Beaux-Arts." Another curious element is the lighting: the foreground is sunlit while the sun is already setting on the horizon. Sunless days, dark days, twilight characterize this particular moment. Daylight is less and less valued as heroic attitudes are replaced by the nostalgic presentation of former heroes, Icarus, Phaeton, Ixion, Prometheus, with emphasis placed on their passivity, their humiliation, or their defeat. Desportes uses the theme of Icarus but emphasizes how desirable is the fate of the hero fallen into the sea. In contrast to previous treatments, the theme is presented as a narrative along chronological lines. 21 Les Regrets in Schmidt, ed. cit., p. 480. "Who will chase from me these greedy Harpies? / Who will soar for me once more towards Heaven / To bring back my senses and return my eyes to me? / And who will enable me to eat my food in peace?" 283</page><page sequence="19">Yale French Studies New meaning is given the hackneyed theme of the blinding glance of the lady. Unlike the eagle, the poet closes his eyes and solicits the dark cover of sleep, night, or death. The complicity of night allows for passivity and ambiguity. Visibility and action, as we have seen, had been ultimate values; negation of sight shows the deflation of heroic attitudes, self-emasculation. In a contemporary play, Robert Gamier's Les Juifves, the king of the Jews is at the mercy of Nebuchadnezzar, the cruel Babylonian king, who identifies himself with the sun and God: Quelque grand dieu qu'il soit, je ne serai pas moindre Ii commande aux eclairs, aux tonnerres, aux vents, Aux gresles, aux frimats, et aux astres mouvans.22 The inflexible Nebuchadnezzar selects a refined torture for his victim, privation of sight. Even Ronsard, inevitably caught up in the fury of religious hatred, calls upon God's wrath to strike the "guilty" with blindness: Donne que les serpens des hideuses Fureurs Agitent leurs cerveaux de paniques terreurs; Donne qu'en plein midi le jour leur semble trouble, Donne que pour un coup ils en sentent un double, Donne que la poussiere entre dedans leurs yeux.23 Earlier, language had been descriptive of the cosmos. It had served to name visible objects; words themselves had become visible objects. Rhythm provided an imitative support for plasticity. Ronsard's sentences explode with thunder or wave sinuously like golden curls around the head of his Venus or his Cassandra. The poets, inspired by the gods, even the hermeticists, had had faith in the creative, magic power of language, a humanistic instrument of knowledge, of re-creation of the world. The Tower of Grammar, the lofty Temple of Virtue, are now replaced by the symbol of confusion of language, 22 "No matter how great the Lord is, I shall be no lesser; / He commands over lightening, thunder, winds, hail, / frosts, and moving stars..." 23 "Grant that the serpents of the hideous Furies / Stir in their minds panic terrors, / Grant that in full daylight their vision be troubled, / Grant that each blow as two blows be felt, / Grant that dust becloud their eyes." 284</page><page sequence="20">Marc Bensimon the Tower of Babel. The persistent evocation of the destruction of soaring symbols in DuBellay's dream evoking the fall of Rome in his Antiquitez de Rome of 1555 already intimated this shift. Critics have not failed to note that the lack of vigor and incisive- ness in Desportes' love sonnets reduces all imagery to mere rhetorical verbosity. They have pointed out, however, how the musicality of his verse saved him from oblivion. Indeed, language achieves an autonomous melodic rhythm independent of meaning. It becomes a charm; it lulls the ear. The aural takes precedence over vision. When vision remains the privileged sense, it is made to serve the cause of outrageous sadism, violence, or exhibitionism, as in those savage poems of Agrippa d'Aubigne where, for instance, he rips open his stomach. Often, fear and guilt dulls the eye, or else introspective interests find vision less useful than darkness, tactile sensations, or silence as means of finding oft-unnamed intimacy. St. John of the Cross, in his ambiguous Noche Oscura, evokes the secrecy of night which prevents seeing and being seen. For him, night leads more surely than daylight to the sensuous pleasures of the blind caress of the wind, to the rustling scent of the cedars. These feelings culminate in the suspension of all senses; they end in total abandon and oblivion. The mysterious and mystic world of St. John is permeated with an obscurity which "gives more reality to what is hidden." Antonymy or even ineffability replaces enumeration, so frequent earlier: "I penetrated there, I knew not where, and I remained, unknowing, surpassing all knowledge." St. John's strange Mountain of Perfection is a paradoxical admonition: To arrive at tasting everything, desire to taste nothing To arrive at knowing everything, desire to know nothing of anything To arrive at being everything, desire to be nothing of anything. No less paradoxical is his graphic version of Mount Carmel. Its resemblance to a mountain is dubious; it suggests depth rather than height. Language and visuality are defeated or bypassed in this kingdom of darkness; blindness becomes a value. 285</page><page sequence="21">Yale French Studies In his religious Stances of Death, Jean de Sponde orders his eyes sealed to worldly life: Mes yeux, ne lancez plus vostre pointe esblouye Sur les brillans rayons de la flammeuse vie, Sillez-vous, couvrez-vous de tenebres, mes yeux; Non pas pour estouffer vos vigueurs coustumieres, Car je vous feray voir de plus vives lumieres, Mais sortant de la nuict, vous n'en verrez que mieux.24 D'Aubigne's long poem, Les Tragiques, narrating the martyrdom of the Protestants, culminates in a Last Judgment where the Catholics in Hell are deprived of their five senses. The Elect, bodies fully resurrected, shall regain their five senses, now purified. Ainsi dedans la vie immortelle et seconde Nous aurons bien les sens que nous eusmes au monde, Mais, estans d'actes purs, ils seront d'action Et ne pourront souffrir infirme passion: Purs en subjects tres purs, en Dieu ils iront prendre Le voir, 1'odeur, le goust, le toucher, et 1'entendre. 25 In his last paragraph, in the best mystic tradition of late XVIth and early XVIIth century baroque literature, the poet suddenly enters into a state of total ecstasy, of fusion with God; he is completely blinded, deprived of all his senses, in a swoon. Chetif, je ne puis plus approcher de mon ceil L'ceil du ciel; je ne puis supporter le soleil. ............................................................... Mes sens n'ont plus de sens, l'esprit de moy s'envole, Le cceur ravi se taist, ma bouche est sans parole: 24 "My eyes, dart your dazzled gaze no more / Upon the shining rays of the flaming life, / Be sealed, be covered with darkness, 0 my eyes; / It is not to suppress your habitual strength / For I shall make you see lights much brighter / But, emerging from darkness, your sight will be far greater." 25 Thus in this second life, immortal, / We shall have the same senses we had, / But, being of pure act, they will be made of action / And shall not bear infirm passions. / They shall be pure and belong to pure subjects, / to God they shall go to take / Light, smell, taste, touch, and bearing." 286</page><page sequence="22">Marc Bensimon Tout meurt, l'ame s'enfuit, et reprenant son lieu Exstatique se pasme au giron de son Dieu.26 Bruegel's painting, which is much earlier (1568), illustrates the Biblical parable that "the blind led by the blind are doomed to fall," blindness is more negative and pessimistic (fig. 10). In fact, the blind are shown falling into a ditch or river where they will presumably drown. This work has been compared to a futuristic painting or even to a slow motion film sequence. Both in the Noche Oscura poem and in Bruegel's painting, supposedly the first in the XVIth century to express "acceleration of motion," what seems to have become important is the chronological dimension. (The use of clocks, in- creasingly common, also reflects growing concern with duration, the existential "passing," the flow). The disproportionate length of the painting, the strong oblique descending lines, colors, and rhythms also lead the imagination to deny individual differences, to assume the same person is captured at different moments in time and in different places in space. The blind are cut off from the sky. The vacuity of their eyes expresses tragic hopelessness. Their walking sticks lead them only towards inevitable doom and mark the futility of man's endeavor. But there is more to the painting. It is also truly futuristic because of its prophetic nature. In it, consciousness becomes identified not only with motion in time, but also with time to be. The blind symbolically calls upon his other senses in vain: his fall is bound to occur. Future time is thus telescoped, made imminent. D'Aubigne achieved the same curious effect by his sudden shift from prophetic narration to the present tense in the final linal of Les Tragiques where ecstasy and spiritual truth replace abruptly sensory knowledge. It is as if the Apocalypse and the beatific vision predicted for a not too distant future (1660!) were suddenly upon him. 26 "Wretched that I am, no longer can I to my eye I Bring down the eye of Heaven; I cannot bear the sun. / ................ ................ / My senses have no senses, my spirit from me flees away, / My ravished heart falls silent, my mouth is without words: / All dies, the soul flies away, and, taking anew its place / In ecstasy it swoons in the bosom of its God." 287</page><page sequence="23">Yale French Studies History replaces the panoramic screen of mythology on which nations had viewed their antiquity. Ronsard loses enthusiasm for his Franciade, for example, and for the legend of Trojan ancestry. Speculation on the philosophy of history and teleology are substituted for poetic reveries about the Golden Age and the Creation. When consciousness cannot face the force of time, it can at least flee with it. It can even run ahead of it. Because of this new linear awareness of time, melodic music becomes important. Simultaneous perspective, ubiquity, is condemned by Montaigne: "The soul which has no established viewpoint gets lost; for, as they say, he who is everywhere is nowhere." Visual perception is less important than tactile and digestive imagery in another passage of the Essays where Montaigne condemns curiosity: "I fear our eyes are bigger than our stomachs, and our cu- riosity greater than our ability. We embrace all, but grasp nothing but the wind." This ability is tested by the author of the Essays and expressed in terms of movement, that of a groping blindman: "My conception and judgment walk only gropingly, staggeringly, ... limpingly, and when I have advanced as far as possible, yet, unsatisfied, I see more coun- try, with clouded and troubled eyes, and I can't make out anything." Movement is often oriented downward. Slow motion with increasing momentum, anticipating Galileo's formula of constant acceleration, like that of Bruegel's painting, appears frequently in Montaigne's Essays: "Since you are in the ditch, it matters little who set you amotion; you always go to the very bottom: the fall stirs itself, rushes itself, and precipitates itself, all by itself." Even self-knowledge is described as an inner movement on oneself: "The others always look outward; I turn my sight inward, I plant it, I entertain it there; others look in front, I look into myself. I study myself un- ceasingly, I keep watch on myself, I savor myself. The others are headed elsewhere ... they always go forward; ... as for myself, I roll myself into myself." Not only does Montaigne emphasize descent into oneself, he also vehemently opposes all attempts at ascension, condemning them 288</page><page sequence="24">Marc Bensimon as presumptuous and bestial. "Fanatic madness," he calls the urge to substitute complicated machinery, colored wheels, and ropes for an adequate scientific explanation of the cosmos. Striving to be angelic results in beastlike behavior. As for cosmonauts, he remarks, "The most fragile and yet proud creature is man: he feels and sees himself lodged here in the mud and excrement of the world, tied and nailed to the worst, the deadest, and most rotten part of the universe, at the lowest level... of the celestial vault, . . . and yet he goes and in imagination plants himself above the circles of the moon and brings the cosmos under his feet. It is by the vanity of this same imagina- tion that he equates himself with God." Little hope is left to man. He cannot rise towards God. God is invisible. When Montaigne does speak of divine grace, he always refers to it as descending upon man without the latter's participation. The instrument of God's grace is His hand usually piercing through a cloud from above as shown in so many emblems, engravings, and paintings. Alone then, since divine grace is normally not his lot, man cuts a pitiful figure. He is lost at sea with a broken helm: as DuBellay, Desportes, Sponde, Montaigne, and even Ronsard in his later years will lament, he is exposed to the winds of passion and strife. Thus humiliated, man waits in darkness for the spiritual sun to rise. It will do so, with a new and dazzling radiance, on the Baroque altar, but that is another story.
