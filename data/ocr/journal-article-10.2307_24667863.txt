<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIAL IDENTITY AND RELIGIOUS RITUAL IN THE KURA-ARAXES CULTURAL COMPLEX: SOME OBSERVATIONS FROM SOS HÔYÛK Antonio Sagona Preamble The concept of human identity is at the nub of the continuing debate within the discipline of archaeology on the nature of material culture and its interpretation. To what extent archaeological assemblages are the material residues of intentional human behaviour, or action, and the extent to which archaeologists can infer from them social structure or ideology have become concerns of central importance to the discipline.1 Since its early days archaeology has used the visible manifestations of past societies as evidence for the existence of specific peoples and ethnic groups. Writing in 1929, V. Gordon Childe defined explicitly for the first time, in The Danube in Prehistory, the concept of an archaeological 'culture', embodying the notion of social totality. A word or two must next be said on archaeological concepts. We find certain types of remains—pots, implements, ornaments, burial rites, house forms— constantly recurring together. Such a complex of regularly associated traits we shall term a 'cultural group' or just a 'culture'. We assume that such a complex is the material expression of what would to-day be called a 'people' ? The formulation of this culture-historical concept, with its stress on materialism and the supposition that communities could be seen as 'functioning wholes' producing assemblages that may reflect their distinctive social identity, was one of Childe's most decisive and enduring contributions to the discipline.3 This conventional view was taken a step further by C. Hawkes, who outlined four levels of archaeological inference.4 According to Hawkes, to infer the level of technology from material remains was relatively straightforward—objects can be weighed, measured, and have their constituent parts chemically analysed; the subsistence economies of past societies were likewise fairly accessible. But to infer the nature of social and political organization, especially of text-free societies, was considerably more difficult, though not as inaccessible as belief systems, religion and ritual which are at the top of his ladder of inference. For Hawkes, therefore, matters of the human mind were abstract and intangible, and could not be extracted from the physical vestiges of past activity. The implication here Was not that religion and spiritual life, for instance, were unimportant, but that without the aid of texts our understanding on such matters would be necessarily uninformed. The avenues of investigation used in the interpretation of the archaeological past received a surge of optimism with Middle Range Theory, a conceptual framework developed initially ' For a historical overview of the various approaches, see B. Trigger, A History of Archaeological Thought (1989). Among specific studies, cf. S. J. Sheenan (ed.), Archaeological Approaches to Cultural Identity (1989); P. Graves-Brown-S. Jones-C.

Sagona as a central concern of New Archaeology of the 1960s and later of the processualist school.5 The study of formation processes (how material culture is formed and subsequently modified) as a system of thought transformed the way archaeologists viewed identity. Material assemblages were no longer connected to 'cultures' that corresponded to 'peoples', rather they were seen as products of past human behaviour that required a new epistemology to render them meaningful. Thus for Lewis Binford, a central figure of this movement, human behaviour 'is the by-product of the interaction of a cultural repertoire with the environment'.6 Fundamental to early processualist reasoning is the functionalism and materiality of this 'by product', and the need to provide general laws of human behaviour to explain the change and variability of physical remains.7 In this sense, the approach to artefact analysis promoted by the prehistorians of the 1960s and 1970s was as materialistic as that of Childe's generation. Moreover, like culture-historical archaeologists they did not address issues that concerned customs and beliefs, maintaining that religious institutions and spiritual life were determined by infrastructure and thus epiphenomenal. The archaeological record is not made up of symbols, words or concepts, but of material things and arrangements of matter.8 Against this background of thinking and despite the growing sophistication of scientific analyses, it has become increasingly evident that more useful interpretative tools are required in our assessment of the distant past. Two rival paradigms have emerged in recent years that have attempted to extend our understanding of the nexus between material culture and identity. Described as cognitive-processual and post-processual, their principles have been influenced by semiotics, psychology, and the writings of social and literary theorists.9 Archaeologists from both schools have argued that the functional materialism advocated by the early processualists should be abandoned, and that the study of culture must include a study of the meanings of symbols and symbolic actions. The concept of symbolism certainly has had a profound impact in anthropology, especially as it figures in theories of culture. M. Sahlins, a leading writer on symbolism in anthropological theory, for instance, states, so-called material causes must be ... the product of a symbolic system whose character it is our task to investigate; for without the mediation of this cultural scheme, no adequate relation between a given condition and a specific cultural form can ever be specified.10 Although both of these current approaches have expanded our perception of social identities in the prehistoric past by opening up ritual behaviour as a field of study, their procedures of evaluation and framework of inference are markedly different. Post processualism, a collective term for several perspectives, is characterized by a number of 5 L. M. Raab-A. C. Goodyear, American Antiquity 49, 1984, 255-8.

According to this outlook, identity is to be found in the specific social context through an exploration of symbolic link between individuals and the products they manufactured. Critics, in particular the cognitive-processualists, maintain that theories must be supported by empirical evidence and, accordingly, that without a systematic method of discrimination post processualism lacks validity. . ' These brief comments hopefully serve to illustrate, however summarily, that although the growing number of conceptual approaches often have distinctive and contradictory premises, they are not mutually exclusive. No matter how one views the nature of material culture, whether as tangible products of human interaction with the environment, or as a part of a semiotic system that needs to be decoded, or even as text that has to be subjected to a number of readings, one point on which most archaeologists would agree is that for theoretical principles to be formulated and theoretical problems to become evident, some sort of contextual and formal analysis of material assemblages is necessary. The purpose of this exercise is to identify and interpret in very general terms certain modes of culturally patterned behaviour in the archaeological record of a span of the late prehistoric period (c.3500-1600 bc) of Trans-Caucasus, eastern Anatolia and north-western Iran, which at the very least suggest the presence of some sort of network of interacting people (an identity) participating in a culture system. More specifically, it offers some tentative insights on the ritual behaviour of these peoples of the highlands by focusing on a general contextual analysis of data emerging from Sos Hôyuk, an ancient mound site near Erzurum, in north-eastern Turkey. The Geographical Setting The most conspicuous single geographical feature of this region is division, the result of a complex terrain partitioned by complicated mountain chains.11 In Trans-Caucasus, the major physical component is the mountain range of the Great Caucasus that stretches from north west to south-east between the Black and Caspian seas, and defines the north-central boundary of the ancient Near East. To the south, the combination of central lowland plains, a subtropical littoral along the Black Sea coast, and highland plateaux punctuated by lakes and lofty volcanoes is responsible for the extreme environmental diversity of Trans-Caucasus. North-eastern Anatolia has an equally complex geographical structure and although its relief has a pronounced east/west orientation, its highland is divided in an intricate fashion. Steep sided valleys and basins incise this land, which rises to more than 2000 m above sea level. The most important traffic axis in this region is the longitudinal Kelkit-Çoruh trough, which straddles the southern foothills of the Pontic ranges, a formidable mountain chain that filters communication to the sub-tropical Black Sea coastal fringe. Despite their rugged geography and extremes of temperature, these large mountain masses of Trans-Caucasus and eastern Anatolia offered a range of ecological options for both pastoralists and farmers. In the central plains of Trans-Caucasus, the light-chestnut soils of the Kura depression, although not the most fertile land in the' area, seem to have been favoured by the earliest Neolithic settlers presumably because of their proximity to stands of wild cereals.12 Later settlements began to spread upland into the thin podzolized soils that are most suited to grazing. The enclosed basins of eastern Anatolia were also a focus of 11 J. C. Dewdney, Turkey: An Introductory Geography (1971); J. C. Dewdney, A Geography of the Soviet Union (1971). 12 G. Ν.

Sagona agriculture practice, though as modern land-use statistics indicate, much of this mountainous territory is unsuitable for the cultivation of cereals. Stock breeding, on the other hand, had more potential in this environment, and promoted the adoption of a nomadic element in subsistence economies, as it still does today. Vast tracts of timber, an abundance of minerals and metals, and a plentiful supply of obsidian must have also attracted the attention of ancient peoples. The Material Culture Prehistoric communities of Trans-Caucasus, eastern Anatolia and western Iran appear to have engaged in a considerable amount of cultural interplay. Yet despite this contact and the region's natural resources, centralized authority was slow to develop. Cultural change in this extensive highland region during the late prehistoric period should not be gauged by the rapid transformations of material assemblages, but through multiple regional adaptations of an enduring fundamental character which was tenaciously preserved for nearly 2000 years. The terms Kura-Araxes, Early Trans-Caucasian, and Karaz are used interchangeably to designate a material culture complex that has a vast distribution, stretching across Trans Caucasus to western Iran and eastern Anatolia. Its chronological spread is equally immense, spanning some 2000 years, though not uniformly across the highlands, from c.3500-1600 bc, as indicated by radiocarbon dates, especially those from Sos Hoyuk.13 A closely related artefact assemblage occurs in north-western Syria (Amuq H-I) and northern Palestine, where it is named after the type site, Khirbet Kerak. Shared features of the Kura-Araxes assemblage include rectilinear, subrectangular, and circular architecture constructed from a variety of techniques; portable and fixed hearths; a wide range of distinctive black and red burnished pottery; well crafted bone implements; standardized horned animal figurines; a simple range of metal objects; and a stone tool repertoire manufactured primarily from obsidian. I do not wish to present a periodization of the aggregates of this assemblage, but to comment on the spatial contexts of the house as the principal mode through which religious identity was expressed during the period in question. Three broad types of settlement and house layout are represented in the Kura-Araxes complex. One group features a squarish room with a narrow forecourt at one end (megaron like) that in plan approximates to a rectangle with rounded corners. Although houses of this type were built of mud bricks, the preferred medium of construction was wattle-and-daub supported on a framework of posts. These houses are well-known from Trans-Caucasus, in particular Georgia, but no examples have been reported from the west Iranian sites.14 Wattle and-daub houses are a common form of architecture at Sos Hoyiik, and are also represented at sites in the Turkish Upper Euphrates region.15 Interestingly, houses of this room-with forecourt plan are found in the Neolithic of south-east Europe and in western Anatolia during the Early Bronze Age, though no connection can be assumed with their appearance to the east of the Euphrates.16 13 The clustered radiocarbon determinations emerging from Sos Hoyiik are causing us to rethink the chronology of the Kura-Araxes cultural complex, which in north-eastern Anatolia extended well into the second millennium bc, see A. Sagona et al., Anatolica 24, 1998 (in press); Anatolica 23, 1997, 181-223; AnatStud 56, 1996, 27^8; A. Sagona-C. Sagona-H. Ôzkorucuklu, AnatStud 55, 1995, 193-218.

The high density of houses and limited amount of unbuilt space would have placed a constraint on outdoor activities. Apart from House 1, a circular structure of 6 m, there is remarkably little evidence for differentiation among the houses. The internal layout of these houses tended to be standardized, and generally furnished with a central circular hearth, the clear visual focus, and a bench along the back wall on which were spread some of the household possessions. The antechamber at the front of the house appears to have been used as a storeroom. It has already been pointed out by some that the plan and floor space (25-40 m2) of these wattle-and-daub structures bear similarities with certain types of nomad tents, suggesting that, as in a modern tent, domains of activities would have been well defined. Settlement plan data also suggest that these and other house types dating to the late prehistoric period in Trans-Caucasus may reflect a vacillating nomadic element in their subsistence economy. The limited area so far exposed at Sos precludes any conclusion on settlement layout, but internally the houses display certain differences to the basic Kvatskhelebi plan. At Sos houses sometimes lack the back bench and central built-in hearth, preferring instead a range of portable hearths (fig. 2). Annexes are not necessarily located at the front of the house, but can be found attached to their side. It also appears that the open space between houses is slightly greater at Sos than at Kvatskhelebi, with one level containing three circular plastered surfaces. The purpose of these surfaces is unclear, but the absence of any trace of burning appears to suggest that they were not used for activities involving hearths.

Clearly the visual focus of the interior, hearths were positioned in front of the bench that ran along the back wall, facing the entrance. Pulur houses were juxtaposed and arranged in a circle around a central courtyard that is redolent of west Anatolian settlement plans such as Demircihôyuk F-H. It is not clear from the report exactly what facilities were found in the yard at Pulur, but to judge from the number of artefacts found indoors around the hearths it appears that many activities were private and domestic. At Sos Hôyiik a single room of this type was exposed. It was built of mud bricks on a foundation of stone and had a circular hearth with raised central horns placed in front of a bench. Interestingly, and perhaps ritually symbolic, a small black burnished bowl had been deliberately inverted over the centre of the hearth. The third type of house is circular and predominates among the eastern sites. As a structural concept, the Near Eastern round dwelling that either stands alone or is attached to a rectangular annex appears to have its roots in the tradition of Neolithic circular hut compounds though the connection is unclear.19 The most extensive Early Bronze Age settlement of round houses has been uncovered at Yanik Tepe, in north-western Iran, where 57 were reported (fig. 3: below).20 Circular structures of varying diameter (2.3 to 7 m) have also been exposed in considerable numbers at Shengavit, in Armenia, and at other sites in Trans-Caucasus and eastern Anatolia. Presently, they have been exposed in the latest Early Bronze Age levels at Sos, continuing well into the second millennium bc.21 At Yanik Tepe, houses were built of mud brick and may have been beehive-shaped, although there is no firm evidence for the construction of the roof. Domestic facilities included hearths, bins, niches, a platform, and a bench around the entire wall. So dense was the cluster of round houses and interconnected walls in level 4B, that alleyways are not easily discernible. The final type of settlement plan is found in the Malatya-Elazig. in the Turkish Upper Euphrates region, which since the Late Chalcolithic owed much to the co-mingling of several cultural traditions—Syro-Mesopotamian, central Anatolian and Trans-Caucasian. During the Early Bronze Age III period these influences, especially those from Syria and Mesopotamia,, were responsible for the transformation of village agglomerations into urban centres that were part of the extensive commercial network of the Late Protosyrian period. At Norguntepe, in the Altanova plain, excavators exposed an impressive complex comprising a palatial structure, storage magazines and residential quarters inter-connected through a network of alleyways (fig. 3: below).22 The largest building, the 'palace', was two-storied and built of mud-brick walls up to 1.8 m thick set on stone foundations. Some one hundred large jars, many found neatly arranged in units, attest to the storage capacity of this complex. Although the concept of these imposing, multi-roomed public buildings was no doubt inspired through contact with the cities of Syria and Mesopotamia, they were not templates in terms of layout. The large 18 Η. Ζ. Kojay, Keban Projesi, Pulur Kazisi 1968-70. Keban Project, Pulur Excavations 1968-70 (1976).

It has massive stone foundations that measure about 2.5 m across the top and a maximum height so far of nearly 2 m. Given that the floor has not as yet been reached and that only a quarter of the structure has been exposed, we must refrain from drawing conclusions at this stage. 22 H. Hauptmann in: S. Pekman (ed.)

Sagona curved hearths at Norjuntepe, comparable to those found nearby at Korucutepe, and other fitments, such as benches, reflect a vigorous upland element with regard to social space and identity. If we assume that ritual behaviour is intentional and highly patterned, then we may well ask what arrangements are suggestive of the sacred at Kura-Araxes sites. One feature is striking at all settlements, irrespective of layout and house type, namely the prominence accorded to the hearth, not surprising given the harsh winters of the uplands. Yet hearths appear to have a significance that extends beyond pure function. They can be permanent, taking the form of a circular plastered depression with central projecting vessel supports or, at Yanik Tepe specifically, a shallow rectangular depression. Hearths may also be portable. Referred to as andirons, they are manufactured from clay and usually in the shape of a horse shoe (fig. 4: 5). Nearly thirty years ago, Steven Diamant and Jeremy Rutter correctly drew attention to the correlation between the distribution of these hearths and Kura-Araxes pottery, but did not venture an opinion on their possible ritual significance.23 Evidence of hearths is plentiful at Sos Hoyiik, and hearth structures and andiron fragments have survived well. In many cases, hearth remains are the best preserved components of a house, indicating that a considerable amount of energy was invested in their production. The built-in variety is always well plastered, often with a well-defined kerb. Portable hearths have three projections and come in a wide range of dimensions, and are associated with ashy deposits in all building levels at Sos. Their projections are sometimes sculpted as realistic or stylized representations of human faces; zoomorphic representations are rarer, with only one example so far from Sos found on the surface in a field adjacent to the mound. While horseshoe-shaped andirons lend themselves to portability, the ultimate design for transportation and adaptability are the three props that can be arranged to accommodate any vessel type (fig. 4: 6). Although distributional and quantitative analysis of the finds has not been completed, a preliminary contextual analysis of artefacts in houses at Sos indicates that the hearth may have had various functions, ranging from utilitarian (profane) to ritual (sacred) purposes. This judgement is based on several observations. First, the largely undifferentiated architecture at Sos does not reveal any special construction that may have been used specifically for sacred functions, nor do the arrangement and contexts of courtyard space suggest an open/public arena for ritual behaviour. Second, the attention demanded by the hearth as the focal point of a house is obvious. Positioned in or near the centre of the house, its sturdy manufacture and anthropomorphic or zoomorphic qualities suggest that the hearth was accorded special significance. Third, the repeated careful deposition around the hearth of certain items is suggestive of ritual patterning. A single standardized horned animal figurine is often associated with an example of the better-crafted items of bone and stone, usually projectile points such as the tanged obsidian type (fig. 4: 2). In quantity formal well-crafted stone tools constitute a very small percentage of the lithic assemblage which is overwhelmingly obsidian and represented mostly by unspecialized, expedient scrapers. Finally, and perhaps most telling of all, is the conspicuous absence of human figurines, a feature which Sos shares with other Kura-Araxes assemblages, but which stands in sharp contrast with contemporary sites in western and central Anatolia. While perishable materials could account for the invisibility of figurines, an alternative explanation involving an interpretation of the significance of the hearth and associated items appears to be more plausible. To evaluate the last observation we must address two concepts: (a) the unnecessary distinction that is generally made between symbolic and utilitarian artefacts; (b) the possible 23 AnatSt 19, 1969, 147-77.</page><page sequence="11">Social Identity and Religious Ritual 23 Figure 5.

Sagona ceremonial and votive significance of Kura-Araxes pottery. Let us turn first to the pottery. The cultural development of the Kura-Araxes complex has a strong focus on ceramics, which are highly distinctive, abundant and diverse, showing many regional variations that demonstrate, more than other artefacts, rapid change. Vessels are invariably handmade, manufactured using either rings or slabs of clay, and come in a range of sizes and shapes from small cups to large vessels with tall necks. The wide variability in terms of size and shape of vessels can be associated with a low level of craft specialization that one can expect to find in domestic production. This idea is based on the assumption that domestic production generally involves a greater number of potters than a commercial, or centralized industry resulting in a greater variety of vessels.24 On the exterior, vessels are usually black, brown or red and often burnished; some have a lustrous black polish and bear a silvery, almost mirror-like surface (fig. 5: 5-7). A high level of ornamentation is not uncommon with a wide range of relief, fluted and incised designs. While some motifs such as rows of running triangles are universally spread, many are region specific. The variety of ornaments can also be shown to have a chronological development that, in very broad terms, tends to move from bold to fine. In terms of social context another generalization can be made that bears on Kura-Araxes pottery production, namely that its manufacture by hand and its decoration with complex designs would have required more time than producing relatively simple undecorated vessels on the wheel. This investment of energy suggests that hand-built, complex vessels are likely to reflect seasonal, or part-time domestic production, rather than full-time commercial industries.25 Although decoration can be elaborate at Sos, it is restricted to specific ceramic types. Noteworthy among the ornamented repertoire is a distinctive tray, which appears to be localized at sites in the Erzurum region (fig. 5: 1-4). The trays have an apsidal-shaped base, with a flat, high and elaborately decorated front; the back and sides of the tray are low. Clearly, the complex designs and fine finish of these trays, and the lustrous polished surface other vessels bear, indicate that the items were meant to be seen and appreciated. In addition to ornamentation and surface treatment, the combination of colour may have been symbolic. Kura-Araxes vessels can display distinct, clearly delineated zones of colour, usually black and red. A good example of this contrasting colour scheme is seen on a large biconical Martkopi type jar, found in a pit (originally probably a burial) datable to the end of the third mill ennium bc (fig. 6). Stylistically, the jar probably derives from metal prototypes, which were deposited in the kurgan burials of the Trans-Caucasus.26 The jar is black burnished except for the everted rim which is red-brown; the incised decoration in the upper part of the body includes a series of concentric lozenges that are emphasized with red ochre after firing. To achieve these visual and surface qualities was labour intensive and deliberate, and suggests a concentrated effort to produce a vessel of meaning and use. Drawing on worldwide ethnographic data, I have argued elsewhere, in relation to the multifarious uses of ochre, that colour symbolism, especially as it relates to the basic colour triad of black, white and red, is fundamentally linked to the human perception of colour."* I shall not reiterate those points here, suffice to say that as we gather together evidence for the interpretation of ritual behaviour, let us not overlook the potential symbolic significance of specific colours that carry deep meanings in many different societies. 24 D.

Decorated Martkopi-type jar. Scale: 1:5. In conclusion, the collective evidence suggests that within Kura-Araxes society religious ritual would have been private and domestic, and centred on the hearth, an 'attention-focusing device', to quote Colin Renfrew.28 Moreover, the absence of human figurines at Kura-Araxes sites is not accidental, rather it is indicative of a mode of worship where the presence of the deity is reflected not in a realistic human images, but, at Sos Hoyiik at least, in the hearth and its ritual paraphernalia—elaborately decorated and highly burnished vessels, a horned animal figurine, and a well crafted item of bone or stone.29 The patterns displayed by the association of these cultural items appear to reflect behaviour associated with a system of belief concerned with the transcendent or sacred. Although the meaning of this symbolism escapes us, one is reminded of V. Turner's view that ritual symbolism is both complex and ambiguous, and has the requisite qualities for social manipulation. In his classic account of the ritual ceremonies of the Ndembu of Zambia, he states: I found that I could not analyse ritual symbols without studying them in a time series in relation to other 'events', for the symbols are essentially involved in social process. I came to see performances of ritual as distinct phases in the social processes whereby groups became adjusted to internal changes and adapted to their external environment. From this standpoint the ritual symbol becomes a factor in social action, a positive force in an activity field. The symbol becomes associated with human interests, purposes, ends, and means, whether these are explicitly formulated or have to be inferred from the observed behaviour. The structure and properties of a symbol become those of dynamic entity, at least within its appropriate context of action.30 28 Op. cit.
