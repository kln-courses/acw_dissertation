<plain_text><page sequence="1">Luo Ye's Zuizveng tanlu and the Culture of Romance Alister INGLIS Simmons College This study approaches Luo Ye's work as a collection of romantic stories and poetry produced within the "culture of romance" that arose during the Mid-Tang and, by the late Southern Song/Yuan period, had developed into a literary sub-genre. After an overview of its textual history and salient contents, a close reading of selected narratives analyzes themes that were unexplored in earlier works. Finally, hitherto thorny questions about its use and authorial intention are addressed. Ever since its rediscovery in 1940, Luo Ye's §!j|I Xinbian Zuizveng tanlu SfÜiSfára i&amp;iS ( New Edition of the Record of a Drunken Man's Talk, hereafter the Drunken Man's Talk) has been recognized by scholars of Chinese literature as an indispensable source for professional storytelling during the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279). The work is a collection of chuanqi , gong'an fiction, jokes, anecdotes, and poetry. Its prefatory chapter imparts a wealth of knowledge about the storytellers' sources and subject matter, their modes of performance, their audience's reception and the like. Its catalogue of 107 professionally told stories has spurred studies on the identification of individual titles.1 It furthermore corroborates and supplements information found in a handful of similar Song and Yuan sources.2 Yet despite its significance, few specialized studies have been undertaken that would facilitate our understanding of the work itself, especially given several *Tan Zhengbi, Huaben yu guju (Shanghai: Shanghai guji, 1956), pp. 2-37; Inada Osamu "Suiõ danroku to Taihei kõki" ¿ in Kanda Hakushi kanreki kinneti shoshigaku ronshü # ffl (Kyoto: Kanda Hakushi kanreki kinenkai, 1957), pp. 517-29; Zhao Jingshen, "Yin Zuiweng tanlu de faxian chonggu huabende shidai" B'8? in Zhongguo xiaoshuo congkao (Jinan: Jilu shushe, 1980), pp. 80-84; Jaroslav Prusek, The Origins and Authors of the Hua-ben (Prague: Prague Oriental Institute, 1967), pp. 64-77.

That is, the controversy over whether it served as a prompt- book for professional storytellers, the disparity some scholars have observed between the prefatory chapter and the remaining contents, in addition to its generic affiliation.3 In this study, I propose to analyze the text by viewing its author as a collector of literary artifacts and, by scrutinizing what he collected, arrive at a clearer understanding of his possible authorial purpose, his intended readership and how we might contextualize the material contained therein. In this way, understanding the first chapter in light of the collection as a whole rather than the other way around is, I believe, a more productive approach to this exciting text. A dedicated study of the Drunken Man's Talk is furthermore instructive as to the "culture of romance" that Owen and others have written about in relation to Tang Dynasty (618-906) literary culture.4 That is, the discursive practice that arose from 3 For major studies that utilize the Drunken Man's Talk as a source for understanding professional storytelling not cited above, see Uemura Kõji "Suiõ danroku o tõjite mita Sodai no setsuwa ni tsuite," £ il D X JL ft CO ą&amp;fg COUt Yamaguchi bungaku l~Lí P 4 (1953): pp. 48-58; Cheng Yizhong, Song Yuan huaben 5)c7niSł (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1980), pp. 59-63; Wang Qiugui, "Lun 'huaben' yicide dingyi jiao houji" in Zhongguo gudian xiaoshuo yanjiu zhuanji, (Taipei: Lianjing chuban shiye, 1981), 3: pp. 49-68; Tian Yuchi, "Lun Songdai xiaoshuo jiyide wenti xingtai," "XWWïîfe Beijing shifan daxue xuebao (shehui kexue ban) 3 (2005): pp. 73-79; Zhang Yong, "Quqide xushi: 'Xinbian zuiweng tanlu' xiaoshuo lilun yanjiu," Yunnan shifan daxue xuebao (shehui kexue ban) žSffi 38 (2006): pp. 95-98.

While the hypothesis that the Drunken Man's Talk acted as a prompt-book for storytellers remains tenacious, Wilt Idema has argued convincingly against it. See his Chinese Vernacular Fiction : The Formative Period (Leiden: Brill, 1974). Foccardi also doubts the prompt-book theory. See Gabriele Foccardi, The Tales of an Old Drunkard (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1981), p. 2.

Daniel Hsieh, however, dates the rise of the "love story" earlier - to the late eighth century for which he identifies the An Lushan Rebellion (755) as its catalyst.

This dissertation is also extremely informative regarding romantic stories as a discursive</page><page sequence="3">INGLIS Zuiweng tanlu 99 approximately the early ninth century valorizing one's romantic life. Accordingly, in regards to prose fiction, literary love affairs between young male elites and beautiful but lowly courtesans were often used to explore questions of inter-class marriage, financial dependency, male anxiety, fidelity to a lover and so on. Besides poetry, many of the most famous Tang chuanqi stories have been read in light of this framework, including the "Tale of Li Wa," "The Tale of Huo Xiaoyu," "Ren's Story" and the like. These tended to focus on love affairs between mortal men and women in which little, if any, attention was given to "supernatural" elements, "Ren's Story" being a notable exception. As we will see below, the Drunken Man's Talk reflects the endurance of such a culture well beyond the Tang. The present study will, therefore, help us understand how this cultural phenomenon developed in the late Southern Song or early Yuan (1279-1368) period.5 After a brief discussion of the work's textual history, I will outline its salient contents for the sake of readers who may be unfamiliar with them. This will lead to a close reading of three selected narratives that illustrate distinctive aspects of the culture of romance in the text. Finally I will address the questions raised above. Apart from the information on the first page that its author was a native of Luling (modern Ji'an in Jiangxi), virtually nothing is known about Luo Ye, suggesting that he was an obscure man of letters outside of the civil service. While one might expect the zuiweng or "drunken man" of the title to refer to the famous scholar and poet, Ouyang Xiu (1007-1072), given that this was Ouyang's sobriquet and- like Luo Ye- he too hailed from Luling, the lack of any significant reference to him throughout the text suggests that the phrase was probably intended as a generic cultural construct unrelated to the great man. Largely due to internal evidence, scholars agree that the Drunken Man's Talk was compiled either during the late Southern Song or Yuan Dynasty, yet disagreements persist as to a more precise dating. While it was initially judged to be Southern Song, the presence of two personal names corresponding to Yuan personas, in addition to two poems found in Yuan anthologies, have since been thought to indicate a Yuan Dynasty provenance.6 Nevertheless, as Li Jianguo points out, both narratives in practice in the ninth century. See also Hong Yue, "A Structural Study of Ninth Century Anecdotes on 'Original Events'," Tang Studies 26 (2008), p. 22; "Romantic Identity in the Funerary Inscriptions ( muzhi ) of Tang China," Asia Major 21, no. 1 (2010), pp. 33-62. 5 As I will discuss below, given that the precise dating of the Drunken Man's Talk is uncertain, it is not possible to speak of either Southern Song or Yuan in relation to the text. 6Nagasawa Kikuya and Usui Kyõichi determined it to be a Jian'an edition from the late Southern Song period. See their "Shimpen Zuiõ danroku ni tsuite," Shoshi gaku 15, no. 4 (1940): pp. 6-12. Others concur with this. See Tan Zhengbi, Huaben, p. 2; Chen Ruheng, Shuoshu shihua (Beijing, 1958), p. 58; Yan Dunyi, Shuihuzhuan de yanbian (Beijing: 1957), pp. 57-58; Xiao Xiangkai, Xiaoshuo shi, pp. 3, 357-60. Nevertheless, several scholars have argued for a Yuan Dynasty provenance. See Zheng Zhenduo, Chatuben Zhongguo wenxue shi (Hong Kong: Shangwu, 1961); anonymous ed., Xinbian</page><page sequence="4">100 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 35 (2013) question mention the "National University" ( Taixue ;fc*P),7 clearly indicating a Song Dynasty provenance (at least in regards to these two pieces) since the Taixue ceased to exist under the Mongols.8 Similarly, the existence of poetry found in the Yuan compilation, the Yuanshi jishi tēh^pIē^ , fails to establish Yuan provenance as many Song Dynasty poems have clearly been preserved in Yuan and later anthologies. Furthermore, the presence of supposed Yuan Dynasty personal names in one of the stories is insufficient evidence given that two people at different times may have shared the same name. Indeed, one of the supposed Yuan names, Wu Bogu ^fSES, may be found in the title of a poem by the famous Song Dynasty poet, Zheng Xie (1022-1072).9 While we cannot be certain whether this was the same person referred to in the Drunken Man's Talk , it certainly undermines the argument for Yuan provenance even though it does not help establish that of the Song. Precise dating of the compilation, therefore, remains uncertain. The work's prefatory chapter, dealing with professional storytelling, informs us that "new stories" featured the exploits of celebrated twelfth century generals, such as Zhang Jun (1086-1154), Han Shizhong (1089-1151), Liu Guangshi (1089-1142) and Yue Fei éfflt (1103-1141).10 This strongly suggests a mid- to late twelfth century provenance at least for this chapter given that stories about these generals abounded in the miscellaneous notebook literature of the era. Furthermore, had the chapter been written later, one would expect the author to have mentioned later personas or military exploits, such as Han Tuozhou's (1152-1207) ill-fated campaign against the Jin in the early thirteenth century. Nevertheless, while this chapter seems to have been written in the late Southern Song, we do not know if it was written by Luo Ye during the same period he compiled the remainder of the work or by another person, or else compiled long after its initial composition as was done with much of Luo Ye' s other material. I will return to this point later. The scant citation of the Drunken Man's Talk in private and imperial bibliographical catalogues throughout the imperial period regrettably prevents a dedicated study of its textual history. Despite the possibility of its having been compiled during the Southern Song, no record of it may be found in the Song dynastic history's bibliographical catalogue, the Song yiwen zhi. Assuming that the Zuizveng tanlu (Shanghai: Gudian wenxue, 1957), p. 1; Y. M. Ma, "Kung-an," p. 202n9. Some scholars have avoided either choice, simply acknowledging it as a Song-Yuan compilation.

The earliest known reference to the Drunken Man's Talk may be found in the early fifteenth century encyclopedia, the Yongle dadian . The surviving chapters of this once monumental compendium contain two items belonging to a work entitled the Zuiweng tanlu . Since one of these is a poem, it is unclear whether it originally belonged to Luo Ye's text or another work of the same title, Jin Yingzhi's álSŽ. (1100-1175) Xinbian Zuiweng tanlu which we know to have been compiled during the Southern Song. The other item, however, is a chuanqi story entitled "Su Xiaoqing" ^ /JnJBP about a woman who turned to prostitution following the death of her parents.11 As the cited source of this story is the Yanhua qiyu (extraordinary rendezvous with the women) sub-section of the Zuiweng tanlu, we can be confident it was derived from Luo Ye's work given its close similarity to one of his subtitles.12 Since the Yongle dadian was completed in 1409, we therefore know that a copy of the Drunken Man's Talk was in the imperial library collection in the early fifteenth century. Whether this was a printed edition or a manuscript, as well as how many juan it contained, nevertheless remains unclear. Since "Su Xiaoqing" cannot be found in the extant imprint, we may further infer that the Ming imperial library copy differed somewhat to the received text and probably contained more. While it is possible that the received imprint is a newly printed edition based on it- which would imply a Ming or later date of editing and printing- there may alternatively have been two different versions in circulation at the time. Zhu Youdun (1379-1439), Ming imperial prince and playwright, mentions a work in his private collection which he referred to as the Luo Yejiwen Zhu mentions this as one of two sources for his play, the Qujiang chi (Serpentine pool), an adaptation of the famous Tang chuanqi story, the Li Wa zhuan . As Zhu' s narrative corresponds largely verbatim to the Li Wa story found in the received edition of the Drunken Man's Talk , we may be sure that Zhu had access to its source at least in regard to this story. Therefore, as Dudbridge observes, we do not know whether Luo Ye wrote two works with overlapping content or whether the Drunken Man's Talk circulated under an alternate title.13 There is also a third possibility: that 11 Yongle dadian (Taipei: Xuehai, 1971), pp. 1122-23. 12 The extant text of Luo Ye's work contains two categories entitled Yanfen huanhe and one each entitled Yanhua pinzao SÍÊiSSI and Yanhua shiji respectively. While the Dadian reference does not correspond exactly to these, it is however remarkably close. Furthermore, Jin Yingzhi's work of the same title, while topically arranged, does not exhibit categories that remotely resemble the Dadian citation. 13 Glen Dudbridge, The Tale of Li Wa: Study and Critical Edition of a Chinese Story of the Ninth Century (London: Ithaca, 1983), p. 9.</page><page sequence="6">102 Chinese Literature : Essays , Articles , Reviews 35 (2013) Zhu may have incorrectly cited the title or else referred to it in an informal sense. Nevertheless his preface, dated 1409, coincides with the date of the Yongle dadian's completion. Therefore his evident access to the received edition's source proves that the text existed at this time, regardless of the title under which it circulated. Zhu may have even accessed the imperial library copy. One of only two other references to the Drunken Man's Talk may be found in the late sixteenth century private bibliographical catalogue, the Baowen tang shumu H 0 • This catalogued the collection of Chao Li MSR and his son, Chao Dongwu Ují ^ (1532-1554) of Kaizhou (modern Puyang, Henan). Besides the title and author, unfortunately no further information is given, yet it does indicate that the work had found its way into at least one private collection by the mid-sixteenth century. The other reference comes from Chao Dongwu7 s contemporary, Li Xu (1505-1593), author of the biji work entitled Jieyan laoren manbi who briefly mentions the Drunken Man's Talk.u This is all that is known about the text's transmission until an imprint was found in the Date collection by Usui Kyõichi - , co-author of Nagasawa's paper that first analyzed the text.15 As this was published in 1940, presumably the discovery occurred shortly before then. Unfortunately, Nagasawa gives no details about the circumstances. This is the only known imprint. A facsimile edition was published by Bunkyúdõ JcMlk (Tokyo) in 1940 which served as the basis for two typeset ones: a traditional character version by Gudian Wenxue of Shanghai in 1957 and a simplified character one by Liaoning Jiaoyu 3Ü in 1998, edited by Zhou Xiaowei i Immediately after the Second World War, straightened economic conditions throughout Japan forced many private collectors to sell their rare books to American collections and Japanese public libraries. Under such circumstances, this imprint of the Drunken Man's Talk came to be purchased by the Tenri University Library, probably in the late 1940's. The Tenri organization commanded extensive funds at the time given hefty donations made to its church and so it was able to build an extensive collection that included several extremely rare Chinese books.16 Examination of this imprint reveals only one collector's seal on the title page of the first juan of the first volume as well as at the beginning of the second: Ēt Date haku Kanrankaku tosho in " (Kanrankaku Collection seal of the Date Clan Chieftain). The Kanrankaku refers to the considerable Chinese language collection of the Date clan who had been famous in Japan's northeastern region since 14Luo Ye, Zuiweng tanlu, p. 1. 15 Nagasawa Kikuya, "Zuiö danroku," p. 6. 16 Yan Shaodang, Hanji zai Ribende Hubu yanjiu ÎXI8Â B (Jiangsu: Jiangsu guji, 1992), p. 328.</page><page sequence="7">INGLIS Zuiweng tanlu 103 the late sixteenth century. This seal was supposedly impressed on their Chinese books around 1878-1888.17 The family's book-collecting is thought to have commenced with its clan founder, Date Masamune (1567-1636), a renowned warlord who sent troops to support Toyotomi Hideyoshi's HË^îÉï (1537-1598) invasion of Korea between 1591- 1598. Collecting on a larger scale is said to have commenced under Date Kõmura as Japanese clan leaders from the late seventeenth century onwards generally began to exchange books as gifts. In 1949 most of the Date family's book collection was donated to the Miyagi Prefecture Library, besides those that went missing during the early Meiji (1868-1912) power transition. Since the Drunken Man's Talk was not among those transferred, we may infer that it had, by then, entered the Tenri University Library. Unfortunately no year of publication appears on the Tenri imprint or any other indication of its age. Were it of Song or Yuan provenance, we would expect to see several seals that would help date and establish its pedigree. The presence of only one seal, however, tentatively suggests a relatively recent imprint. Alternatively, were there to have once been a preface now lost or decayed, any older seals would have perished with it. Given that the Date book collection began with Masamune, it is feasible that the imprint could have entered the collection during the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century. If so, this would not only explain the dearth of seals but it would also place the imprint close to the time of the Baowentang catalogue whose compiler, Chao Gongwu, died in 1554. This opens the possibility that it may have been the same edition as Chao's. Nagasawa tells us that it supposedly entered Japan through Korea, although no such record may be found.18 It might have, therefore, been among the war-booty taken by Masamune's soldiers between 1591-1598 that was known to have been added to his collection. Nevertheless, while this must remain speculation, no evidence for a history of ownership traceable to the Song or Yuan period is apparent. There are, however, numerous indications that the wood-blocks from which it was printed were considerably older than the imprint itself. One may observe even from the facsimile edition that the blocks for numerous pages were slightly cracked. Others exhibited major cracks that required joining.19 Several pages furthermore reveal traces of wood-worm. Consistent with this is its decidedly poor printing quality. Some characters appear almost blurred while, on the same page, others are 17Kayaba Takeyuki introduction to Gõko Yasuo et al., Date Bunko mukuroku Ē IS (Miyagi: Miyagiken toshokan, 1987), p. v. I would like to acknowledge the kind assistance of Shizunaga Takeshi and Ihara Hiroshi of Kyushu University regarding the identification of the seal. 18 Nagasawa Kikuya, "Zuiõ danroku," p. 6. 19 On the manner in which woodblocks were joined, see Lucille Chia, Printing for Profit : The Commercial Publishers of Jianyang, Fujian (11th - 17th Centuries) (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2002), pp. 31-33.</page><page sequence="8">104 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 35 (2013) only faint, symptomatic of worn blocks from which a great many impressions have been made.20 Hence, the received imprint is almost certainly a reprint taken from an older set of wood-blocks; how old is, unfortunately, unclear. Nagasawa considered it a Jianyang imprint of the Song dynasty given, among other considerations, its dense placement of characters in addition to the presence of numerous simplified characters.21 While this is consistent with surviving Masha imprints of the Yuan period, it is clearly inconclusive. Therefore, as Lucille Chia has surmised (private correspondence), the blocks could conceivably have been carved at any time between the Southern Song up until the Qing. Copious annotations have been made throughout the 1957 edition noting the numerous textual and editorial errors- not to mention lacunae- that riddle the Tenri imprint. A casual perusal of this edition will, therefore, reveal the extent of the problem. In addition, one of the poems has been incorrectly divided by the Tenri imprint's anonymous editor. Furthermore, the chapter sub-titles do not always follow their own logic.22 All this strongly suggests that the received imprint has been heavily re-edited based on either an earlier printed edition or a manuscript that had long since deteriorated over time. Therefore, had Luo Ye compiled his work during the late Southern Song, it would not be implausible that a Yuan editor may have produced the received imprint based on such an earlier copy. If, however, Luo Ye himself was working during the Yuan, the Tenri imprint could not have been printed before the Ming given the time necessary for the earlier imprint (or manuscript) to have deteriorated to the extent that it evidently had. The existence of the Ming imperial library copy on which the Yongle dadian entry was based further complicates matters since it was clearly different from the received imprint. We cannot, therefore, be certain if one was based on the other or if two different versions existed. Unless another copy re-emerges, however, all this must unfortunately remain unclear. Nevertheless, the prefix "Xinbian" (newly edited [edition]) in the current title likely refers to an actual recension of an earlier text. I would now like to turn to the collection itself. What did Luo Ye, as a collector of stories, collect? How did he arrange his collection? What may we infer about his authorial intent and his interests as an author-collector? In regards to this, even a cursory reading of the text reveals that he was primarily interested in stories of 20 This indicates the texťs popularity shortly after the edition was first published, despite the lack of bibliographical citations. This paradox itself poses an interesting question whose resolution must await further data. 21 Nagasawa Kikuya, "Zuiõ danroku," p. 6. 22 Most of the poem attributed to Madam Qian on page 20 of the 1957 edition originally belonged to the following one attributed to Madam Wu on page 22. When compared to Madam Wu's poem as preserved in the Yuan shijishi, we can see that much of the latter was erroneously attributed to the former. See the Yuan shi jishi (Shanghai: Shanghai guji, 1987), p. 828. Furthermore, as noted above, the category of Yanfen huanhe appears twice on pp. 12 and 55. This is a clear indication of later erroneous editing.</page><page sequence="9">INGLIS Zuiweng tanlu 105 romantic love and sexual encounters. Moreover, the overwhelming majority are refreshingly free of overt didactic sentiment reflective of conservative Neo-Confucian mores. The theme of romantic love pervades diverse genres of which chuanqi are particularly numerous. There is also much anecdotal fiction (in the traditional sense of xiaoshuo /M£, or "small talk"), as well as several jokes. Gong'an or "detective" fiction, so profuse from the Song Dynasty onwards, intersects selected chuanqi that exhibit a Song temporal setting. Related to this is an entire juan reserved for judicial verdicts pertaining to women and sexuality. Furthermore, as might be expected, numerous poems are interspersed throughout the prose stories or else framed within a brief prologue in the benshi shi manner. While dating individual stories is often problematic, many romantic narratives and poems are, however, clearly of Tang provenance. This is perhaps not surprising given the Mid-Tang "culture of romance" and the many romantic stories and poems it generated. Such material certainly compliments Luo Ye's collection and indicates his profound interest in such a topic. In fact, Tang narratives and poems are somewhat more numerous than those bearing Song temporal settings. Certainly many Southern Song authors exhibited a deep interest in Tang culture and history. Therefore had Luo Ye lived during this period, his interest in the Tang would have been comparable to other men of letters. Many of his other narratives exhibit either a Northern or Southern Song temporal setting discernable from internal dates. Whether these were composed during the Southern Song is, unfortunately, unclear. No narrative, however, exhibits a temporal setting later than the twelfth century. A smaller amount of material does not specify a time period, while a few anecdotes feature well known women from the Six Dynasties. Finally, one juan focuses on a story bearing a date from the Five Dynasties. Among the Tang narratives are some extremely famous chuanqi, such as "The Tale of Li Wa," "The Tale of Liu Yi" and the dragon-king of Lake Dongting's daughter, "Princess Lechang and the Broken Mirror," "The Tale of Wushuang," the tale of Mistress Liu and Han Hong, "The Tryst of Crimson Silk" and similar romantic tracts. As these tend to resemble their Taiping guangji antecedents, minor textual variants notwithstanding, the Guangji may have been Luo Ye's source for this group.23 All have been extensively studied as reflections of the Mid-Tang "culture of romance." Accordingly, they often narrate love affairs between young men of the ruling elite and courtesans- women of a decidedly lower social rank, during sojourns in the Tang capital where abundant sensual temptations corresponded to their removal from immediate parental jurisdiction. Typically the young men, having enjoyed a whirlwind sexual affair, either remain faithful to or else spurn their courtesan-lovers. In this way the narratives explored themes of inter-class marriage, marital free-choice, sexual expression, fidelity in love and the tensions this created vis-à-vis filial piety, 23 For a study of narratives from the Drunken Man's Talk that have a parallel text in the Taiping guangji, see Inada Osamu, "Suiõ danroku."</page><page sequence="10">106 Chinese Literature: Essays , Articles , Reviews 35 (2013) family honor and social expectations. Some plots became so formulaic that Hong Yue has identified an "erotic triangle" story-type featuring a young male whose sweetheart is snatched away by a more powerful male rival.24 Indeed, several of Luo Ye's stories exhibit such as plot. There are also several famous chuanqi stories about encounters with immortal maidens, such as that of Zhao Xu and the Lady of Green-Youth, Guo Han and the Weaver Maid, Feng Zhi and his refusal to mate with an immortal woman, Xue Zhao's resuscitation of Yunrong, in addition to Peihang's union with an immortal whom he met at the Blue Bridge. The earliest story of this type narrates Liu and Ruan's famous encounter with immortal women during the Six Dynasties. Again, most of these closely follow parallel versions found in the Taiping guangji. Prior to the emergence of love stories between mortal protagonists during the Mid-Tang, encounters with immortal women constituted the bulk of romantic tales in which sexual themes were developed relatively free of Confucian sexual morality, such as Cao Zhi' s IffjË (192- 232) fu poem about the goddess of the Luo River, as well as the encounter between King Xiang of Chu (r. 298-263 BCE) and the goddess of Witch's Mountain (Wushan ZE LU). Such stories proved perennial favorites throughout the imperial period. The story of Guo Han and the Weaver Maid is perhaps the raciest in Luo Ye's collection in which the goddess blatantly disregards the fidelity owed to her immortal husband, the Oxherd, as she sustains an affair with a mortal lover. Such behavior certainly defies traditional Confucian expectations of female sexuality, yet this type of story apparently frees both the human and immortal protagonist from the social mores against which they would have otherwise been judged. The famous folktale about a poem sewn inside a battle jacket by one of the Xuanzong emperor's (r. 712-755) palace ladies is a good example of Luo Ye's anecdotal fiction in which the narrative acts as a frame for the central poem, yet the plot itself is sufficiently developed to sustain interest. There are also, as noted above, two chapters of poetry written by Weng Yuanguang (dates uncertain) who, during a visit to a patron, composed heptasyllabic quatrains inspired by individual courtesans whom he encountered. Unfortunately, lack of biographical data about the poet prevents us from dating his poems. Finally there is a chapter corresponding to much of Sun Qi's (A. 880) Beili zhi JhM^ (Record of the northern quarter). Textual omissions and rearrangement suggest that Luo Ye had discovered an old, poorly preserved copy of the text and attempted to reconstruct it. The Beili zhi was written as a memoir about its author's experience, ostensibly first hand, of the bordello area in the Tang capital Chang'an during the mid-ninth century. It describes the courtesans' backgrounds and early training along with the circumstances under which they entertained men and the constraints under which they lived. Anecdotes about famous men's encounters with them were also included. That Luo Ye would wish to incorporate material from the 24 Hong Yue, "Romantic Love," p. 22.</page><page sequence="11">INGLIS Zuiwerig tanlu 107 Beili zhi should not be surprising given that this, even today, is the only extant factual source about the courtesans of Chang' an during the Tang. It therefore complements nicely the "fictitious" narratives he collected. And given his reconstruction of a badly preserved and probably rare text, we can well imagine the joy he must almost certainly have felt at having added it to his collection. This recension of the Beili zhi also compliments the narratives Luo collected about the renowned Song Dynasty lyric poet, Liu Yong (990-1050). Following a brief introduction to Liu and his peccadilloes with courtesans as well as his poetic talent and Daoist inclinations, Luo presents two narratives about his visit to courtesans in Jinling (modern Nanjing) and Kaifeng. These stories are also free of moralistic grandstanding and seem to have been collected for their rhetorical and entertainment value. All the material outlined above shares an overriding theme of romantic love and sexuality. The presence of these literary artifacts within a single collection indicates the author's deep interest in romantic encounters as well as the admiration that he and others of his generation evidently held toward the Tang Dynasty. And to be sure, the act of collecting such material shows that the Mid-Tang culture of romance had far from diminished by the thirteenth or fourteenth century- if the Drunken Man's Talk had indeed been compiled so late. On the contrary, this theme was still being used to explore the new concerns of a new generation. This brings us to an important point about the collection's place in Chinese traditional literary history. Long before the compilation of the Qingshi (History of affection), that a Song or Yuan author would exclusively collect romantic stories is, I believe, significant. While the romantic encounter as a discursive practice- particularly in relation to chuanqi stories as well as poetry- has long been recognized by modern scholars, romance as a literary category in its own right, collected almost exclusively for intrinsic value without didactic import, has garnered insufficient recognition. And to be sure, Luo Ye was not the only one to collect romantic stories; the anonymous Song Dynasty author of the Lüchuang xinhua (New tales from a green lattice window) was another such collector, in addition to Zhang Junfang's (jinshi 1005) Liqingji SSWU. The Mid-Tang period was a particularly fertile one for the production of similar works, such as Meng Qi's (fi. 841-886) Benshi shi and Fan Shu's ÎBÛ (fl. 875-888) Yunxi youyi Feng Menglong's (1574-1646) Qingshi is a prime example from the Ming, while many such works were compiled during the Qing.25 The writing of specialized collections of romantic stories is, I would argue, no less analogous to the writing of zhiguai (anomaly and "supernatural") accounts which Hu Yingling ifìMWì (1551-1602) recognized as a "genre," if they were not so regarded much earlier. The dedicated collecting and writing of romantic stories 25 See for example Wang Xingqi, "Lun Qingren biji xiaoshuode yanfenlei zuopin," IftiÂÀiïlB'h aft fàSh Ming Qing xiaoshuo yanjiu 2 (1991): pp. 205-17.</page><page sequence="12">108 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 35 (2013) may, therefore, be considered something akin to a hitherto unrecognized literary "genre."26 Also relevant to the texfs generic affiliation, as Dong Shangde has observed, the Drunken Man's Talk may be partially viewed in the tradition of the leishu MWt (encyclopedia) given its topical arrangement.27 Luo Ye, or the anonymous editor of the Tenri imprint, has divided the text into ten major sections according to the heavenly stems and, as each stem comprises two juan, there are twenty in all. As was done with many leishu, each juan bears a sub-title based on plot. This itself is a valuable guide as to how Luo Ye and his contemporaries understood the narratives vis-à-vis generic story-types and, given the lack of systematic theory for this type of fiction, may inform future studies. Both juan 1 and 2 from the gui series, however, contain two such sub-titles. Since this departs from the pattern discernable elsewhere, we must assume that it is the work of a later editor. Yet thanks to the Yongle dadian citation, we know that the Ming imperial library copy was arranged categorically, therefore categorical arrangement per se was not a later editor's invention. I will now turn to a close reading of selected stories that bear a post-Tang temporal setting since these, unlike the Mid-Tang chuanqi, have not been extensively analyzed as literature and are instructive as to the thematic changes that the romantic tale had undergone. The story of Lian Jingnü's MffÄ affair with Chen Yanchen WM Ë illustrates several key elements shared by other narratives.28 The judge that appears at the story's conclusion, Wang Gangzhong ŽEHU,® (1103-1165), indicates a Southern Song temporal setting. Wang passed the jinshi examinations in 1145 and, according to the Song shi (History of the Song), his first appointment was that of a judge although the locality is not specified. Hong Mai, however, records that he served in Mingzhou (modern Ningbo, Zhejiang) in 1147. 29 The story, therefore, is set in the late 1140's. 26 1 use "genre" in the traditional Chinese sense of wenti (which emphasizes literary style or form), conscious that it differs from the Western tradition. On this term, see Benjamin Penny, "Early Daoist Biography: A Study of the Shenxian Zhuan" (Ph.D dissertation, Australian National University, 1993). 27 Dong Shangde, "Lun Zuiweng tanlu," p. 104. 28 Luo Ye, Zuiweng tanlu , pp. 14-17. A parallel text may be found in the Liichuang xinhua IS (Shanghai: Shanghai guji, 1991), p. 57. Given that Luo Ye mentions this work in his introductory chapter, the story analyzed here is therefore a later version regardless of whether it was directly or indirectly derived from the Liichuang xinhua. The additional details of Luo Ye's version suggest another source, perhaps an oral one. 29 For Wang's traditional biography, see chapter 386 of the Song shi , jfe vol. 35, Ershiwu shi "hi jfe (Taipei: Wenyi), pp. 4778-79.

One of their neighbors, Chen Yanchen who was also of the scholar-official class, unsuccessfully sent a matchmaker to propose marriage, thereby joining a host of other would-be suitors whom the mother had already rejected. Nevertheless, the pair were subsequently able to flirt face-to-face while poetic correspondence, sometimes written on lamps and delivered by pliant waiting women, served as both a means of communication and a display of their literary talent. This, furthermore, coincided with the Oxherd Festival- the celebrated once-a-year meeting of stars in Vega and Altair that were anthropomorphized as the mythical Oxherd and Weaver Maid. In the context of the narrative, this reinforces the idea of separated lovers destined to meet. Indeed, allusions to the folktale are plentiful in the protagonists' poetry, thereby identifying the human lovers with this longstanding archetype of the romantic encounter. And so, through poetic communication, they arrange a rendezvous and consummate their mutual affection with sexual intercourse. On the third such occasion, however, they are discovered by Jingnü's mother who promptly hauls them before the local magistrate; i.e., Wang Gangzhong. The narrative then transforms into a gong' an piece in which the judge, impressed by the lovers' poetic prowess, rules that they be allowed to marry. The gong' an conclusion conforms to what Y. W. Ma considers an early form of this fiction-type since substantial attention is paid to the recording of legal documents.31 Furthermore, the judge does not play an instrumental role throughout as he does in the gong' an fiction of the Ming period or, indeed, in many Southern Song pieces. The author's interest, rather, seems more centered on the poetry as well as Wang's "flowery verdict" (huapan Tb^!l) than the narrative per se which, at this point, serves as a frame for the verdict's witty verses.32 Unlike ninth century chuanqi that invariably featured love affairs between protagonists of glaringly disparate social stature, both lovers are of comparable status; i.e., offspring of the elite, educated, scholar-official class. Nevertheless, elite and educated families during Sung times often used marriage as a means of social mobility given the disparity that existed even among their own class. In Jingnii and Chen Yanchen's case, whatever social discrepancy there was- if any- remains unclear since the basis for the mother's objections to either Chen or the other suitors is not explained. Perhaps she considered none a fitting match for her daughter on the 30 Yanping was commonly used during the Yuan; during the Southern Song, it was known as Nanjian zhou This, therefore, may indicate either Yuan composition/retelling or else Yuan period editing of an earlier text. 31 Y. M. Ma, "Kung-an," p. 205. 32 Dating from the Tang period, flowery verdicts were written in parallel prose and often touched a humorous note.

Post-Enlightenment scholars may easily forget how serious a consideration this was vis-à-vis arranged marriages during imperial times although, in regards to Chen, the mother's objection appears more substantial We will return to this point later. Since she was widowed, however, we may reasonably infer that her financial circumstances would have been somewhat strained, certainly in comparison to when her husband was alive. Therefore she would understandably have wished to marry her daughter on a financially sound footing along with high social status. Unfortunately the lack of details regarding her refusal prevent us from understanding the relevant financial considerations and, therefore, the protagonists' social power-dependency. Attention is, therefore, drawn to the lovers' hard-won freedom to arrange their own marriage, even if this should involve illicit sexual relations. To be sure, it is the lovers' disregard of society's sexual prohibitions that looms large in this story yet, despite their violation of it, they attain judicial sanction to be married. Furthermore, such success is gained despite staunch opposition by the mother whom society recognized as possessing full authority over her daughter's sexuality and obedience. The lovers' behavior certainly constitutes a serious challenge to traditional social mores. One and a half year's penal servitude was the penalty for illicit sex according to the Song penal code.34 The offending couple were furthermore thought to accrue other-worldly demerits according to the Daoist tables of merit and demerit (gongguo ge ïfjàSfê)-35 Their behavior also constituted a violation of Buddhist codes of chastity. Jingnii and Chen also violate the long established custom of using a matchmaker. Since this was based on no less an authority than the Li ji HttĚ (Book of rites) in which was written, "Without a go-between men and women have no contact,"36 their act of non-conformity constitutes a fundamental challenge to the sacrosanct Confucian rites that underpinned proper social regulation. The couple's filial impiety aligns the narrative with the great chuanqi romances of the Mid-Tang in which the elite male's filial duty invariably outweighed loyalty to his 33 See Patricia Buckley Ebrey, The Inner Quarters : Marriage and the Lives of Women in the Sung Period (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), pp. 61-62. 34 Quoted in Brian McKnight, Law and Order in Sung China (Cambridge, Eng.: Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. 104. Also see Patricia Ebrey, Inner Quarters, p. 49. There did, however, appear to be a discrepancy between the enforcement of centrally sanctioned legal codes and local practice. In other words, imperial law was not always strictly enforced. This may well have been the case here. On this in the context of marriage laws, see Christian de Pee, The Writing of Weddings in Middle-Period China (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2007), pp. 187, 194-212. 35 On this, see R. H. van Gulik, Sexual Life in Ancient China (reprinted, New York: Barnes and Noble, 1996), pp. 246-51. 36 Quoted in Ebrey, Inner Quarters , p. 75.</page><page sequence="15">INGLIS Zuiweng tanlu 111 courtesan-lover. In this way tension between social expectation and private space could be explored. To resolve the tension, either the male abandoned his beloved or else the latter must have been elevated into elite society and thereby naturalized, as was the case with Li Wa. Yet while the Tang stories inevitably reaffirmed society's control over individual protagonists, Jingnii and Chen Yanchen successfully assert their freedom. That freedom of choice, the basis for all romantic fiction of the period, triumphs despite formidable social barriers is, to me, what most renders Luo Ye's stories refreshing and exciting. It is this element that distinguishes them from the numerous didactic tracts that filled notebook and zhiguai works. And the reasons that enable the protagonists to do so are, to be sure, equally exciting. In this regard, the literary talent displayed by both lovers appears a significant factor in the judge's favorable decision. Each was able to ad-lib a poem on a mundane theme set by the judge that they used as a means to plead their cause; a bamboo blind in Jingnii's case, while Chen was asked to utilize the trope of a butterfly caught in a spider's web. This he wittily crafted into a metaphor of his own plight. And to be sure, in the verdict, Wang evokes the well established notion of how a beautiful woman and a man of talent make a fitting match. As we shall see below, wittily wrought rhetoric as a mitigating factor in cases of sexual misconduct reoccurs in other of Luo Ye's stories. Nevertheless, a much more significant circumstance exists that justifies the couple's promiscuity; i.e., the idea that their marriage was somehow divinely ordained. To be sure, when Chen comes to Jingnü for their first sexual encounter, the author tells us how he was "as if Heaven sent." Then, just prior to their second tryst, the voice of the third person narrator asks: "If they were not a match made in Heaven, then who was?" The notion that human marriages were divinely sanctioned by an anthropomorphic Heaven is first found in the Shi jing gvflf (Classic of poetry), Mao number 236: Heaven looked down upon the earth; On King Wän its summons lit. Heaven for him, soon after birth, Had prepared a consort fit.37 In the last two lines, "Heaven ... had prepared a consort fit" could alternately be translated as "a match made by Heaven." Hence from ancient times, this idea seems to have gained currency throughout Chinese society. In this story, then, divinely sanctioned marriage is what largely excuses and ameliorates the lovers' transgressions. And, as Patricia Ebrey observes, if marriages were made in Heaven, 37 Trans. William Jennings, The Shi King (London: Routledge, 1891), p. 280. For the original Chinese, see Qu Wanli, Shijing quanshi IÍÂÍÈÍI (Taipei: Lianjing, 1983), p. 455.</page><page sequence="16">112 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 35 (2013) matchmakers were superfluous.38 So too, in some cases, was parental consent. This idea further provides the loophole through which illicit sex could be justified and condoned. In this light, were it assumed between author and reader that Jingnü's other suitors were rejected due to incompatible horoscopes and, therefore destinies, it would fit nicely with the narrative's theme of conjugal predestiny. Condoning illicit sex, therefore, blurs the distinction of the formal and informal, questions the universal validity of institutionalized ritual, and sanctions informal consummation that may later be normalized through social recognition. The author- collector skillfully deconstructs the inherent contradiction found between the cherished ideas of marital predestiny and those underpinning formal Confucian wedding rituals. This unique stance reminds us of Owen's contention that, when comparing the Mid-Tang writers of romance with the intelligentsia of the Song, "the great Song intellectuals" were given to "singular interpretation, as opposed to the restatement of received knowledge."39 This narrative, therefore, calls for a radically different approach to upper-class marriage from that generally adhered to throughout the Song and Yuan- one that could disregard the very cornerstones of Confucian practice. The concept of predestiny in marriage occurs in other post-Tang stories that Luo Ye collected. And while its importance is not overt in Jingnü's story, it is more so in others. Indeed, although the story of Weaver Maid and Star Brother exhibits no explicit temporal setting, identical thematic elements are developed.40 The plot is simple: a young woman's scholar-official grandfather, while accepting a new appointment in the capital, promises her in marriage to a powerful official's son, thereby causing her to elope with her cousin with whom she had been betrothed since birth. That a marriage agreement was made in this manner, along with its gong'an conclusion, cautiously suggests that the story might be of Song Dynasty provenance given that many Song narratives of a similar theme drew on the same device; i.e., influential officials exerting influence to arrange marriages for their offspring. After the powerful official hears that the lovers have settled in faraway Sichuan,41 he has them tried by an anonymous judge, thus bringing the narrative to its conclusion. Numerous details that develop the theme of marital predestiny enliven the plot. Furthermore, much attention is given to the couple's written testimony for their trial. This, written from each protagonist's point of view, introduces a large degree of psychological depth to the story. 38 Ebrey, Inner Quarters , pp. 53, 57, 58-59, 61, 262. 39 Owen, End of the Chinese Middle Ages, p. 7. 40 Luo Ye, Zuiweng tanlu, pp. 6-11. 41 Sichuan was also the destination of Sima Xiangru and his lover, Zhuo Wenjun, in addition to that of the lovers in the eighth century chuanqi story Li hun ji This, therefore, might be an inter-textual marker. See chapter 358 of the Taiping guangji (Shanghai: Guji, 1990), vol. 3, pp. 551-52.</page><page sequence="17">INGLIS Zuiweng tanlu 113 The tension between the young man, Star Brother, and the powerful official over marriage rights demonstrates how the "erotic triangle" that Hong Yue has written about in relation to ninth century chuanqi continued to be explored by Song-Yuan storytellers. It is this that brings the plot to its crisis, allows for a gong' an resolution, and exposes a paradox related to conjugal predestiny that Luo Ye so often explored; i.e., between free choice and social obligation. As with the above story, both Star Brother and Weaver Maid are not only of the same social class, they are first cousins. While this may perplex many modern readers, marriage between relatives or cousins who did not share a surname was common as Ebrey has carefully documented;42 cousins who shared the same surname, however, were prohibited from marrying. Nonetheless, in this narrative the theme of loving cousins accentuate the predestiny element that is developed in several ways. Firstly, before they were born, the couple's mothers betrothed them on the understanding that they were of the opposite gender. Given that Star Brother's mother and Weaver Maid's father are brother and sister, their intended marriage constitutes the second marriage in their family- what Patricia Ebrey terms a "repeating" marriage- which is a further sign of predestiny in the context of the story.43 And, indeed, when the babies are born, the boy is born a little earlier than the girl. This is, as may be inferred from Weaver Maid's deposition, yet another sign of Heaven's sanction. That the mothers name their children Star Brother and Weaver Maid again demonstrates their intention while linking the couple to the famous myth about the Oxherd and the Weaver Maid. This intertextual marker is made explicit in Weaver Maid's legal testimony when she rhetorically asks if their names were chosen at random. Then, as with uxorilocal marriages, Star Brother was "adopted" by Weaver Maid's parents and even studied with her in school- at the same desk. This too points both to marital predestiny and provides a vivid image of their harmonious childhood companionship. Furthermore, during their childhood and adolescence, the narrator tells how they conveyed mutual affection through body language. The reader's attention is specifically drawn to this as Star Brother's mother would remark how the children were a "match made in Heaven" when seated side-by-side. Such are the multiple signifiers of marital predestiny. Predestiny in this narrative is largely premised on parental consent, unlike Jingnü's case in which the couple opposed the mother's will. It is, therefore, much more "conservative" and correct vis-à-vis a strict Confucian moral code. Indeed, the couple conform to almost every aspect of orthodox social expectation. Nowhere does illicit sex occur and, when Star Brother expresses his wish for it during the elopement, Weaver Maid refuses. 42 Ebrey, Inner Quarters, pp. 66-73. Hong Mai, also, records a case whereby a young man wished to marry his cousin although his hopes were eventually dashed. See his Yijian zhi, Ding 4: p. 564. 43 On marriages between relations, see Ebrey, Inner Quarters , pp. 66-71.</page><page sequence="18">114 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 35 (2013) It is only when the grandfather, awed by a metropolitan official's influence, belatedly agrees to another marriage that the tension between predestined and arranged marriage is exposed. And as the couple belong to the same scholar-official class, thematic tension is not caused by glaring class discrepancy. Nevertheless, the grandfather's action does suggest that his intended match was socio-politically advantageous. As noted above, this was a fairly common theme during the Song. The story therefore reflects the dependence of lesser politically and, no doubt, financially influential families on the goodwill and patronage of stronger ones and reveals the anxieties of collectors and authors of chuanqi stories during the period- presumably the Southern Song. Hence the underlying reasons of the class tension implicit in this story are not unlike those that fuelled the Mid-Tang chuanqi . The conflict between the belated and original betrothals expose a further problem: who took priority in such a dispute? The mothers who initially arranged the marriage, or the senior male patriarch who was favored by Song marriage law? Although the narrative does not specify, it appears that the initial agreement was verbal. It furthermore involved neither traditional matchmakers nor the exchange of betrothal gifts. The agreement, therefore, may well have been considered informal and, consequently, its legality became questionable. This is undoubtedly why the grandfather could agree to another betrothal and the metropolitan official able to lodge a suit. Yet, despite the power he wielded and the legal proceedings he enacted against the young couple, despite the lovers' disobedience to patriarchal authority, they eventually emerge triumphant due to the idea that their initial marriage was divinely sanctioned and marked with numerous signs of Heaven's blessing. Indeed, the presiding magistrate at the story's conclusion considers this when he rules that "Star Brother and Weaver Maid are as though they have long been related," citing the prenatal marriage contract. And to justify his decision, he evokes a legal precedent that there were those among the "ancients" who took wives without proclamation. And so he ruled in their favor even though no matchmaker was involved. Given this logic, it was hardly surprising that Jingnü and her lover could choose freely despite the failings of multiple matchmakers sent by other suitors. Yet one is left with the impression that this was more authorial wishful thinking than a reflection of contemporary reality. As with the previously analyzed narrative, the anonymous judge's role is restricted to the story's resolution. Unlike the previous narrative, however, the couple's legal depositions are quoted in full. To be sure, the author-compiler seems more interested in their rhetoric than anything else. The narrator tells us how these were written in perfectly composed parallel prose. Presumably this display of literary talent contributed to the lovers' eventual release. The depositions, therefore, fulfill a similar function to the poetry in Jingnü's and many a Mid-Tang story. Valued for their literary skill, they help to resolve tension. Certainly the retelling from each protagonist's first person point-of-view is something fairly rare in this type of story.</page><page sequence="19">INGLIS Zuiweng tańlu 115 Also reminiscent of ninth century stories is how the woman- Weaver Maid- assumes control over the action. She initiatives negotiations with her lover, executes a plan of action and, while instigating the elopement, she tells Star Brother that her motive is to "fulfill the happiness of a hundred years"; this again points to marital predestiny. As observed above, she also rebuffs his sexual advances during their flight and, when they complete the final stages of matrimony, all is done according to her will. In her decision to elope, she is therefore not simply conforming to her parents' wishes but consenting to the marriage of her own free will. Significant also is how the families' womenfolk initiate and forge the verbal marriage agreement. Although the men also presumably consented, it is not made clear. This supports Ebrey's remarks about women portrayed in literature as primary decision makers vis- à-vis their children's marriages.44 Finally, the story of Liang Yiniang and her cousin, Master Li, is set during the Five Dynasties, although the version that appears in the Drunken Man's Talk was most likely retold during the Song.45 The narrative itself is fairly terse and, like the benshi shi form, serves more to frame the several poems that follow rather than present a fully developed narrative. The well established abandoned woman trope features copiously in these verses. Some individual pieces are introduced separately, giving the precise circumstances of their composition. In the narrative, a neighbor's wedding feast afforded the pair an opportunity to engage in sexual intercourse which, the narrator tells us, was the basis on which their union was considered divinely sanctioned. The affection they subsequently displayed for each other led to discovery by their families after which they were separated for a year. The poems, songs, and correspondence that follow were apparently written during this time. As with the above narratives, Yiniang's initiative is highlighted as only her correspondence to her lover is recorded and, to be sure, we are told how it was she who consented to sleep with Master Li. Li would, no doubt, have played a part in all this but his role is minimized and he remains a shadowy figure whose actions and motives may only be surmised. Indeed, there are hints in Yiniang's poetry that he may have abandoned her at one point. Unlike the two stories analyzed above, this couple were not summoned before a magistrate; it was their parents who, citing Confucian wisdom, historical precedent and- not surprisingly by now- conjugal predestiny, consented for them to marry. Firstly they discuss how sexual desire is natural to humankind, based on no less an authority than the Mengzi īĒī1: "That men and women should live together is but a basic human desire."46 This is juxtaposed to a quote from the Yangzi fayan that advocates human conformity to naturalness: "When heaven and earth coalesce, 44 Ebrey, Inner Quarters, p. 64. 45 Luo Ye, Zuiweng tanlu, pp. 55-59. 46 A slight variant character notwithstanding, this is a quote from the "Wanzhang shang" SS _L chapter of the Mengzi ŽÍŤ. See the Sishu duben 0 lísSÝ (Taipei: Mingshan, 1952), p. 490.</page><page sequence="20">116 Chinese Literature : Essays, Articles , Reviews 35 (2013) everything in the natural world is born; when man and the Way are matched, merit is thereby perfected/'47 On a more practical level, the parents mention the desirability of stifling gossip by allowing them to marry; this also occurs in another of Luo Ye' s stories.48 And, as noted above, they recognize the desirability of bending to Heaven's will. Finally, historical precedent is cited: the intermarriages between the Liu JglJ and Fan &gt;Ě families recorded in the Zuozhuan that spanned several generations, those between the Chen and Zhu families from Bai Juyi's É3jiíj| (772-846) poem entitled "Zhu Chen cmť^Ktfí (Zhu Chen village), and the marriages between the warring states of Jin # and Qin ^|.49 Hence a fairly nuanced argument justifies free choice in marriage and, at the same time, condones illicit sex. Nevertheless, the discrepancy between the parenťs eventual consent and their initial opposition is brought to the fore. This is reminiscent of the father's behavior at the conclusion of the "Tale of Li Wa" when he eventually accepts the courtesan as his daughter-in-law and thereby naturalizes her into respectable society yet, unlike Li Wa, Yiniang and her lover do not perform any feat of scholarship (passing the examinations as did Li Wa's lover) or concede to traditional Confucian morality so as to gain respectability. Yiniang and her cousin seem to share similar social status, although we have even less information about this than in the previous two narratives. Besides the fact that Yiniang was an educated woman and that Master Li was her maternal cousin, the narrator says nothing more. This forces us to speculate: was she the daughter of an impoverished scholar or was the family well off? That they had sufficient surplus capital to spend on a daughter's education suggests financial surplus, yet the degree of their affluence is unclear. Also, was Li's family wealth and status equal to that of his aunt's? If not, this might help explain the basis for the parents' initial objection if conflicting horoscopes did not play a part. Nonetheless, the two lovers' comparable social status accentuates the theme of conjugal predestiny. This is developed in several ways. As mentioned above, an explicit narratorial comment tells us that the couple's destiny commenced with their illicit sexual encounter. Furthermore, a line from Yiniang's song speaks of her tying a double heart-knot to symbolize their union during this encounter. Presumably this constituted an informal marriage ceremony as tying knots was an integral part of wedding rituals during the Song and other periods. And as noted above, the parents speak of conforming to the will of Heaven in their deliberations. Therefore Heaven's will is consummated by sexual intercourse. As with the previous narratives, the lover's freedom of choice is valorized while the importance of matchmakers and parental arrangement is simultaneously diminished. 47This is a quote from section 3 of the "Xiushen" chapter of the Yangzi fayan jSŤŽfcíí . See ed. Dong Zhi'an and Zhang Zhongwang, Yangzi fayan (Shandong: Shandong youyi, 2000), p. 39. 48 Luo Ye, "Yin xiong jie decheng fufu" in Zuiweng tanlu, p. 26. 49 For Zhu-Chen village, see the Quan Tang shi (Zhengzhou: Zhengzhou guji, 2008), 433: p. 1. For a brief explanation of this poem and its allusion in English, see Patricia Buckley Ebrey, Inner Quarters, p. 71.</page><page sequence="21">INGLIS Zuiweng tanlu 117 While Luo Ye, as a compiler-collector of literary artifacts, seems to condone premarital sexual encounters premised on the idea of marital predestiny, he does not appear to celebrate it for its own sake. Yet, if marriage was considered predestined, then traditional society's taboo regarding premarital sex was seriously undermined. Similarly, some stages of the wedding ritual generally considered essential could be rendered superfluous, such as s final wedding ceremony conceived as a familial and public ritual (as we saw in Weaver Maid's case), or else the earlier stages involving go-betweens. Alternatively, informal ritual undertaken by the couple themselves, as when Yiniang tied a "double-heart" knot to symbolize conjugal unity, could be equally important when performed with sincerity by a divinely sanctioned couple. Finally, the lovers' own agency in their marriage seriously undermined the authority of arranged marriages and, by extension, those who arranged them. Nevertheless, this surely must have been a somewhat extreme stance even before the advent and consolidation of Neo-Confucianism and the stricter social mores that it ushered. It would not be until the early twentieth century when, as part of the May Fourth Movement, authors would advocate the abolition of traditional arranged marriages in favor of Western style courtship. Seen in this light, we may more fully appreciate the boldness of the themes Luo Ye developed. By now we may understand the Drunken Man's Talk as a collection of love stories, anecdotes and jokes concerned with the literate man's relationship with women, whether she be wife, lover, courtesan or mistress. We may furthermore appreciate the care with which Luo Ye compiled his collection and the discrimination he evidently exercised in his choice of material. While some stories must have been well known to his readers, others- such as the Beili zhi accounts, were carefully reconstructed from old works that must surely have been rare at the time. We are now in a position to draw conclusions and address some thorny questions about the text. Y. M. Ma has noted a disparity between the prefatory chapter and its relation to the whole.50 Given that this chapter discusses professional storytelling, it creates an expectation that the remaining contents will include a wide sampling of storytelling sub-genres. The extensive catalogue of titles and its categorical schema reinforce this impression. Nevertheless, while a handful of Luo Ye's chuanqi stories are found in the catalogue, the majority are not. Furthermore, the diversity of genres- poetry, jokes, short anecdotes and so on- have no obvious connection with storytelling and have somewhat obscured the underlying theme of romance. Post-modern readers in particular, trained to expect homogeneity in literary works, have therefore perhaps misunderstood the work's intent, especially since the idea of romance as a literary category was not posited by traditional literary critics. Yet recognizing the Drunken Man's Talk as a collection of romantic stories enables us to consider the question from another angle; why did Luo Ye introduce his collection of romance with a discussion 50 Y. M. Ma, "Kung-an," p. 204.</page><page sequence="22">118 Chinese Literature: Essays , Articles , Reviews 35 (2013) of storytelling? Before answering this question, I would like to consider whether he wrote the prefatory chapter himself or else copied it from an earlier work. As I observed above, the prefatory chapter is almost certainly of late twelfth century composition given that the examples of "new stories" it cited were limited to the exploits of generals who fought the Jurchen invaders in the mid-twelfth century. Yet, were the Drunken Man's Talk to have circulated during this period, we would expect to find references in bibliographic catalogues or else citations in biji works of the period. No such record survives if it indeed existed. And, as I have shown above, the earliest reference to the work stems from the early fifteenth century. Hence while we may be confident that the chapter itself was written in the latter half of the twelfth century, we cannot be so certain as to when Luo Ye compiled his collection as a whole. This leads me to question the prefatory chapter's authorship. Had Luo Ye been active during the Yuan and selected the chapter from its original context to preface a collection of stories that were marginally related - chuanqi and gong' an narratives, jokes and poetry, then the disparity Ma observed may be readily understood. Even had Luo Ye compiled the work in the Southern Song, the same possibility applies. Given that he evidently copied much of his other material, it is somewhat likely that this chapter also was transcribed from another souce. While lack of sufficient evidence prevents me from proving this, it can at least act as a useful hypothesis until further evidence- if any - emerges. Regardless of whether Luo Ye composed or collected his introduction, his reasons for introducing his collection with it may be understood as follows. The chapter opens with a poem whose last two lines read: I have compiled 3000 scrolls of breeze and moonlight To spread among kindred spirits who would speak of the past and present. Since "breeze and moonlight" (JE£} fengyue) is a well established metaphor for romantic encounters, I would cautiously interpret this as a subtle statement of authorial intent; i.e., his intent to collect stories pertaining to romantic and sexual themes. It certainly corresponds to the work's overriding theme while the references to stories about the "past and present" is also consistent with the Drunken Man's content; i.e., stories ranging from the Six Dynasties to the Southern Song. Furthermore, the reference to compilation also reflects Luo Ye' s activities as a collector-compiler of literary artifacts. Interestingly enough, the term "breeze and moonlight" was also part of the Lüchuang xinhua author's sobriquet: Huangdu fengyue zhuren MfPSHÌA (Breeze and Moonlight Master of the Capital).51 Given the shared content of this work and the Drunken Man's Talk, the choice of "breeze and moonlight" cannot be coincidental and may possibly be understood as an intertextual marker. Immediately after the poem, the author embarks on a discussion that reduces humanity to two major types: the sagacious and the ignorant. Following this is an 51 For an explanation of this pen-name, see Zhou Lengqie, Lüchuang xinhu, p. 3.</page><page sequence="23">INGLIS Zuiweng tanlu 119 outline of the nine schools of literature that virtually mirrors Ban Gu's in the Yiwett zhi of the Former Han dynastic history.52 Indeed, Hu Yinglin included a similar summary in his Shaoshi shanfang bicong Luo Ye' s inclusion of xiaoshuo- best understood in this context as professional storytelling as opposed to written "fiction"- albeit last in the list, enables the author to contextualize storytelling Within the traditional literary canon and thus normalize its status. His focus then turns to its role; its position as an adjunct to history and the cathartic benefit of popularized historical accounts for contemporary listeners, in addition to its didactic aspect. To illustrate this, he summarizes human and political history from the beginning of the world as he and his contemporaries understood it. Then, in the second part of the chapter, he discusses storytellers' professional training, their technical proficiency and sources before returning to the didactic and educational effect of their stories. In this discussion is enmeshed thè much studied catalogue of story titles listed under eight sub-categories of xiaoshuo. As I observed above, collecting primarily romantic stories was certainly no orthodox literary activity for a thirteenth or fourteenth century author-compiler. While the cultural elites of the imperial period extensively engaged in reading and writing xiaoshuo, it was never an activity in which they felt entirely sanctioned to engage. When they did so, they tended to justify their endeavors. To be sure, the prefaces of many a zhiguai collection hit a decidedly apologetic note, citing histórica! precedent and the desirability of broad knowledge by way of defense. We must also remember the pre-eminence that historiography claimed over literary production and its influence on "fiction"; what Gu Ming Dong has succinctly termed the "tyranny of history."54 Accordingly, the recording of anomalous and unorthodox accounts was often justified on the basis that events related therein may have plausibly occurred; this is particularly true of the Song Dynasty.55 It should be no surprise, therefore, to find a similarly apologetic tone in Luo Ye's prefatory chapter. To be sure, the author carefully highlights the storytellers' erudition, arguing that they were not "mediocrities of superficial knowledge." His extensive discussion of the benefits brought to their listeners implies that there were those among his constructed readership who might have disagreed. His explanation of the models at the storytellers' disposal and their technical prowess seems crafted to inspire the admiration of his constructed readership. That he spills much ink to contextualize storytelling within the canon of orthodox literature reveals his efforts to legitimate it as a worthwhile literary-cultural pursuit. And, lastly, the careful presentation of storytelling as a supplement to history explicitly links it to a revered 52 See Chapter 30 of the Honshu (Taipei: Yiwen), pp. 890-914 passim. 53 Hu Yinglin, Shaoshi shanfang bicong Sili (Taipei: Shijie shuju, 1963), pp. 344-46. 54 Gu Ming Dong, Theories of Chinese Fiction (New York: State University of New York Press, 2006), p. 5. 55 On the influence of Song historiography on the fiction writing of the period, see Zhang Zhuping, Yijian zhi lungao ĪĀSLīfei&amp;i! (Beijing: Zhongguo wenshi, 2002), pp. 5-23.</page><page sequence="24">120 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 35 (2013) genre, thereby offering further rationalization. All this makes sense had Luo Ye felt the need to apologize for his collecting what many would almost certainly have considered "frivolous" stories. This is why he likely either wrote the introduction himself or else copied it from elsewhere. One may also question the inclusion of the extensive catalogue. That a consistent number of 16 are given for each category suggests they do not constitute an exhaustive list, nor would one expect this. Surely contemporary readers must have known at least some of the titles, so why would the author discuss what they must have already known? Given that this catalogue is framed within an apology for an unorthodox activity, perhaps he simply mentioned some of the better-received ones so as to garner affirmation, much as movie advertisements mention productions already familiar to potential viewers? I would, for these reasons, argue that the prefatory chapter both introduces and justifies the author's endeavors to collect what would have been widely considered a fetishistic collection of literary artifacts. Influenced by Lu Xun's theory, several scholars have understood the Drunken Man's Talk as a prompt-book used by professional storytellers. Indeed, Prusek extravagantly claimed that the existence of prompt-books could not be doubted after the rediscovery of the Drunken Man's Talk.56 Yet when we consider how Luo Ye carefully selected literary artifacts on a similar theme and, furthermore, extensively apologized in the prefatory chapter, we can see how his apparent intention undermines the plausibility that the Drunken Man's Talk was ever intended or deemed suitable as a prompt-book. Had he or his printer-publishers wished to provide a prompt-book, surely they would have included a much wider variety of stories so as to reach the widest possible customer-base? To be sure, devoting the entire first chapter to an apology for the unorthodox would have been both a waste of space and a futile gesture to the storytellers who supposedly relied on his book. His constructed readership, therefore, does not appear to have been professional storytellers. Proponents of the prompt-book theory furthermore fail to explain why Luo Ye, assuming he intentionally compiled a prompt-book, would have included many lengthy chuanqi stories, some of them longer that their Taiping guangji counterparts. Yet nobody has claimed that the Taiping guangji was intended as a prompt-book. And while a comparison of parallel texts between the two works occasionally reveal slight textual variations, this would not, as Dong Shangde has argued, indicate an attempt to modify the text for a storyteller's needs.57 On the contrary, were the prompt-book theory at all plausible, we would expect to see brevity of plot and expression a consistent feature of the Drunken Man's Talk ; this is not the case. It is true that some of Luo Ye' s stories are less fully developed than others. Yet in regards to many of the shorter pieces, the author's interest is apparently focused on 56 For Prusek and other proponents of the prompt-book theory vis-à-vis the Drunken Man's Talk , see note 1. For Lu Xun's articulation of his theory, see his Zhongguo xiaoshuo shiliie in Lu Xun quanji (Beijing: Renmin wenxue, 1981), 9: 112. 57 Dong Shangde, "Lun Zuiweng tanlu," p. 103.</page><page sequence="25">INGLIS Zuiweng tanlu 121 the poem or judicial ruling rather than the narrative that frames it. And this, clearly, may be understood as part of the benshi shi literary tradition. Therefore any attempt to view them as storytellers' prompts would seem fraught with difficulty. That Luo Ye would devote two entire juan to poetry about women from an obscure poet further speaks against his work having been intended or deemed suitable as a prompt-book. As he tells us in the introductory chapter, professional storytellers had recourse to the "fine lines" of great poets, such as Li Bai (701- 762), Du Fu tfcļf (712-770), Han Yu (788-824), Liu Zongyuan (773-819), Ouyang Xiu RNMi (1007-1072), Su Shi BU (1037-1101), Huang Tingjian (1045-1105) and Chen Shidao (1053-1101). Therefore, were the Drunken Man's Talk suitable as a prompt-book, one would expect it to contain poems of these major poets, not those of a virtual unknown. Furthermore, in his introductory remarks to the two chapters of poetry, Luo states that he included them due to their popularity; i.e., they were in circulation at the time. No mention is made about their use or suitability for professional storytellers. This is not to say that other texts may have been "prompt-books/' yet their existence must surely be called into question by the very information that Luo Ye conveys in his prefatory chapter. Given that professionals were literate and could access sources such as the Yijian zhi and the Taiping guangji, surely they would have felt little need for specialized prompt-books? To suggest otherwise is to overlook their professional capacity for memory. To be sure, in a period when oral literature was undoubtedly as popular as its written counterpart and in which scholars would routinely memorize vast tracts of Confucian texts, a professional storyteller could have easily memorized a considerable repertoire. And, should they have needed to "brush up," there was a plethora of classical-language sources to consult. The prompt- book theory therefore, somewhat ironically, over-emphasizes the written text over the oral. Scholars generally recognize that oral stories develop "lives" of their own, undergoing numerous subtle variations with each retelling.58 A comparison of the "Tale of Li Wa" in the Taiping guangji and the Drunken Man's Talk is a good example. Among other details, the latter omits the funeral director's competition that the former spilled considerable ink to describe. Accordingly, the idea that professional storytellers might have relied on prompt-books does not adequately account for the malleable nature of the oral story as it implies that the plot would have been fixed or else overly influenced by the written text. For this and the reasons discussed above, contrary to Prusek' s statement on the matter, I would argue that the rediscovery of the Drunken Man's Talks in no way proves the existence of "prompt-books," nor was the work itself likely to have been used as one. 58 See, for example, Michael Bakhtin, Speech Genres and Other Late Essays, trans. Vern W. McGee (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1986).</page><page sequence="26">122 Chinese Literature : Essays , Articles , Reviews 35 (2013) Finally, recognizing works such as the Drunken Man's Talk as part of their own literary category helps explain the existence of the Qingshi and similar works in the Ming and Qing. So as to account for the "emergence" of the Qingshi, Lee Mowry has argued that in the "romantic, liberal atmosphere" of the late Ming, given the rise of Wang Yangming (1472-1529) and Li Zhi's (1527-1602) philosophy, it "was only natural that at such a time, an anthology dealing with ch'ing should appear, that anthology being the Ch'ing-shih Z'59 While the late Ming intellectual context may well have proven conducive to the writing of romantic or even erotic works, we must also consider other factors to explain their "emergence," not least of which is the generic literary legacy inherited from compilations such as the Drunken Man's Talk . To be sure, the Qingshi' s stories were largely adapted from much older ones. Therefore author- compilers of later romantic collections already owed a significant debt to author- compilers such as Luo Ye. 59 Hua- Yen Li Mowry, Chinese Love Stories from the Ch'ing-shih (Hamden, Conn.: Archon, 1983), p. 5.</page></plain_text>
