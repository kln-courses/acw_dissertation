Noting that the Rebbe himself was childless and that his death is denied by the meshichistim who keep viewing him as the designated Messiah, I seek to deconstruct these stories by exploring the implications of his exalted messianic status. The narratives in which the Rebbe' s power to grant new life is particularly evident involve dreams, visions, and the Rebbe' s pictures. One of the Rebbe' s iconic portraits, designated "the picture with baby," recurs in stories connected to childbirth because the believers detect a baby face in the Rebbe' s raised hand there. Various associations connect the baby in the Rebbe' s hand with babies born following his blessing, thus forming the impression that in the believers' inner lives the Rebbe may assume the role of the child's progenitor. This notion is discussed in the context of the connection between creation and procreation in Jewish mysticism and of the Rebbe' s messianic ideas. Keywords Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson • Habad messianism • Childlessness • Procreation • Creation Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson (The Lubavitcher Rebbe), the charismatic seventh Rebbe of Habad Hasidism, increased the messianic fervor among his Hasidim after he took on his role as Rebbe in 1951 (Berger 2001; Dein 2010; Y.

Though, over the course of his career, he avoided explicitly identifying the individual who would become the Messiah, the messianic fervor which he cultivated became focused upon himself, and many of his Hasidim began to see him as the King Messiah. Given this background, when the childless Rebbe, who had not appointed a successor, died on the third of Tammuz, 5754 (June 12, 1994), the movement was deeply shaken, and many doubted whether it would ever recover (Friedman 1994; Shandler 2009, pp. 255-256). Today, eighteen years after the Rebbe's passing, Lubavitcher Hasidism continues to function vibrantly, despite the conflicts that have spread between different sub-groups. Many Hasidim continue to believe that the Rebbe is the designated Messiah and while not denying that he passed away, they expect him to return from the dead to fulfill his messianic destiny. A significant minority of the Hasidim, referred to as meshichistim [messianists],1 believe that the Rebbe "is alive and exists with a body and soul, precisely literally" (kepshuto mamash ), and that he continues to live in his home, 770 Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.2 The meshichists do accept that, due to human shortsightedness, the Rebbe has become invisible, "in occlusion," since June 12, 1994. But they insist that he will soon be revealed as the ultimate redeemer (go yel a 'harorì), just as Moses, the first redeemer (go yel rishon) was encased in the cloud on Mount Sinai for 40 days before returning with the Torah (see, for example Sasson 1998, pp. 523, 547). This study focuses on the meshichist Hasidim in Israel. In terms of background and sensibilities, the Israeli messianists differ quite markedly from veteran Lubavitchers in America. Many of them are new Hasidim, whether religious returnees (ba'alei teshuva) or immigrants from other religious communities. As against the Ashkenazi background of veteran Habadniks, many of the meshichists are of Mizrahi (Sephardic) extraction. Relatively distanced from Habad' s rabbinical establishment, they glorify the Rebbe and embrace his messianic vision with the zeal and conviction typical of newcomers and returnees (cf. Szubin 2000). We still lack the historical perspective to evaluate the implications and consequences of Habad's messianic ferment; but in certain ways it is reminiscent of key moments in religious history, when the disappointment following the death or disappearance of the designated Messiah led to crisis and from there to religious creativity and expansion. In this essay, I intend to examine the echoes of the religious imagination among radical Habad circles in the context of what might be called "popular culture." I am less concerned here with either Habad theosophic mysticism (Elior 1993; Schwartz 2010) or with the Lubavitcher Rebbe's messianic 1 It is difficult to evaluate the size of various factions in Habad. The meshichistim are certainly not numerically insignificant in terms of the global Habad Chabad collective and they make their presence felt very strongly both in Crown Heights and in the Habad communities of Israel (see Kravel-Tovi and Bilu 2008, pp. 67-68; Kravel-Tovi 2009, p. 256), where this study was conducted. 2 The denial of the Rebbe's disappearance among the meshichists is supported by the fact that in gematriah (numerical equivalents) 3 Tamuz, 5754 equals "the Messiah is still alive" (od mashiah hai). The word mamash in the expression "quickly and immediately, in actuality (tekhef umiyad mamash)," which the Rebbe used regularly in his sermons when claiming that the redemption is imminent, is explained by the meshichists as an abbreviation for Menachem Mendel Shneerson ( Matna"sh ). Also, the expressions "the house of the Messiah" (beit mashiah) and "spread out" (paratztah ) equal 770. â Springer</page><page sequence="3">Childlessness, Procreation, and Creation in Messianic Habad 113 doctrines (Dahan 2008; Gotlieb 2009; Wolfson 2009), though they do provide important background. Rather, I will focus on the Rebbe's ability to perform miracles, and the practices which derive from that, by examining stories in which the Rebbe's intercession allows childless couples to be blessed with offspring. These stories, circulating among the Hasidim as personal accounts, combine day-to- day events with dream and revelatory experiences, and weave them into elaborate narratives. The stories are orally transmitted among believers before eventually taking a written form. Stories of a tzaddik (righteous and saintly person, the spiritual leader of a Hasidic community) whose blessing grants children to believers are common within the Hasidic orbit, since the tzaddik' s primary worldly task is to provide his followers with offspring, particularly sons (Dan 1999, p. 155). Hence, it is not surprising that among the two hundred miracle stories which appeared between December 1994 and June 2000 in Habad' s messianic Sihat HaGeulah - a pamphlet devoted to parashat hashavu'a, the weekly Torah portion read on Saturday's morning service in the synagogue - nearly one fifth of the Rebbe's interventions concerned fertility and pregnancy problems (Reinitz 2001). These were the most common problems for which people turn to the Rebbe for help according to meshichistic sources. In itself, this should not surprise us. Yet, within the broader field of Hasidic hagiography, these stories stand out due to the acute messianic context in which they are grounded. Three interrelated aspects of these stories are distinctive in this respect. First, the chronological aspect: all of the stories relate to the period after the Rebbe's "occlusion." The tzaddik' s continuing influence after his death is not itself novel, since according to believers, the spiritual force hidden in his soul does not diminish. They enlist the Talmudic statement that "the righteous even in their deaths are considered alive" (BT Berakhot 19b), to support their claim. Some sources even suggest that this spiritual force may grow when it achieves freedom from the bounds of flesh and blood (Dahan 2008, p. 258; Goldberg 2009, pp. 152, 192). Still, as we shall see below, the claim that the Rebbe is literally alive in body and soul implies that his body is involved in the giving of the blessing in a direct and tangible way. Those who turn to the Rebbe generally approach him using the "Oracle of the Holy Letters" ( Iggrot Kodesh) (Bilu 2009).3 Second, the biographical aspect: the one 3 Reports on the use of the "Oracle of the Holy Letters" to contact the Rebbe first appeared in the messianic press at the end of 1994, six months after his occlusion. While the system was derived from a time-honored Jewish tradition of bibliomancy, there is no evidence that it had been widespread in Habad during the Rebbe's reign or before. The system is based on the Rebbe's "Holy Letters" {Iggrot Kodesh ), the vast epistolary exchange in which he was involved during his tenure of fifty-odd years. This correspondence, encompassing tens of thousands of letters of reply by the Rebbe, was published in 29 volumes by Habad' s central publication organ, Otzar Chasidim ("Hasidic Treasure"), based in Crown Heights. To receive the Rebbe's advice or blessing, the supplicant randomly inserts the written petition into an available volume, opens it, and looks for an answer by scrutinizing the two to four letters in the two adjacent pages bordering with the petition. Given the rich data that these pages provide, the vast overlap in problems between the current supplicants and those who actually wrote the petitions, and the endless interpretive associations that can be used to close the gap between the supplication and the reply, it should not come as a surprise that the system has become quite popular in wide circles of Habad, as this paper amply demonstrates. Special centers for writing to the Rebbe have been established in Israel, with new standardized avenues for using the Holy Letters through telephone, fax, and internet services. A pocket-size edition of the Holy Letters renders the oracle mobile and portable, thus making it available â Springer</page><page sequence="4">1 14 Y. Bilu whose blessing opens the womb of the infertile and offers children to the childless is himself childless. Third, the cosmological aspect: the Rebbe is viewed as the universal Messiah, a rare occurrence in Hasidism.4 This aspect includes the other two previously mentioned. Chronologically, the Messiah is eternal: "The Last Redeemer must live for ever" (Dahan 2008, p. 303). From a biographical perspective, "the absence of a successor is an almost necessary aspect of the messianic figure" (Dan 1999, p. 195). The complex relationship between the Hasidic tzaddik and the world of divinity, which will occupy us below, becomes exponentially more explicit and weighty as soon as he is declared the Messiah. This blurring of boundaries is a common feature of messianic movements, and it reaches its peak when the Messiah attains a divine status. The theme of the divinity of the Rebbe appears at the margins of the meshichist camp in Habad, despite opposition which arose both from within Habad and from outside (Berger 2001; Dahan 2010). To conclude, the messianic status of the Rebbe makes the fertility stories distinctive, as I illustrate below, even though such stories in the Jewish tradition appear more explicitly linked with a tzaddik rather than a Messiah. This essay builds primarily on stories in Sihat HaGeulah, a pamphlet with a particularly important place among the growing number of Habad messianic publications. "The Weekly Pamphlet for the Messianic Age," to quote its subtitle, is published in "Bat Yam, city of the redemption" by the "Organization for the True and Complete Redemption," edited by its director, Rabbi Zimroni Tzik.5 The pamphlet, with a circulation of some 30,000 copies a week (Caplan 2006), has within its format fixed columns dealing with the Rebbe' s teachings, his status as eternal Messiah, the miracles he performed, and the organization's activities in spreading the message of the redemption. Most of the stories of the Rebbe's miracles appear in the column "Miracles Now." The pamphlet began to appear about three weeks after the "event of the third of Tammuz, 5754," the Rebbe's occlusion, as a direct response to it. The pamphlet - of which there have been 888 issues up until the beginning of March 2012 - offers an opportunity to examine prospectively and systematically, on a weekly basis, how the absent Rebbe is made present in the consciousness and in the life spaces of believers in the years that have passed since his disappearance. In addition to Sihat HaGeulah , in this article I have also made use of the messianic collection entitled To Open the Eyes (2007), as well as interviews conducted in 2007-2010 with 20 Hasidim from Kfar Habad, Jerusalem, Safed, Bat-Yam, Beitar-Ilit, and Pardes Hana. Most of the interviewees Footnote 3 continued for multiple consultations regarding an ever-growing array of problems. For the meshichists the growing accessibility of the Rebbe through correspondence is another indication that he is "with us more than ever." 4 Breslav is the only other Hasidic sect where a tzaddik, in this case the group's founder Rabbi Nachman, was accorded a messianic status (though less explicitly than in contemporary Habad), an attribution which barred the possibility of a successor. For a comparative analysis of Habad and Breslav, see Bilu and Mark (forthcoming). 5 Bat Yam, a working class town south of Tel-Aviv, is designated "city of redemption" simply because the "Organization for the True and Complete Redemption" is located there. Ideologically it resonates with the notion that the messianic aura is universal and omnipresent. Meshichists liberally attach idioms of redemption to various plebeian places in Israel (e.g. Givat Olga = Givat HaGeulah). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="5">Childlessness, Procreation, and Creation in Messianic Habad 115 were males and of Ashkenazi background, who defined themselves as meshichists. More than half of them were religious returnees, three of whom served as emissaries in Habad Houses. The first interviews were conducted in Bat-Yam, with activists associated with Sihat Hageulah , and proceeded from there using a "snow ball" method. Most of the interviewees were willing subjects, eager to share and dispatch the messianic vision and pleased that their experiences were being given scholarly attention. Did the Rebbe Choose to be Childless? As noted above, the fact that the Rebbe was childless is consistent with his attributed status as the last savior. Joseph Dan has expressed this clearly and acutely: "Schneerson denied the limited and partial messianism of the Hasidic dynasty, and replaced it with a messianism of one individual, childless, and therefore an eternal savior whom death cannot control" (Dan 2000, p. 312). The Messiah, as the ultimate Redeemer, is meant to seal history through an apocalyptic process which would bring perfect salvation. Hence, it would be inappropriate for him to have successors. Furthermore, a long-standing Habad myth determined that the movement - to be precise, the Lubavitch brand of Habad - would have seven leaders, the last of whom "would be without sons, and he will be the Messiah who will bring the redemption" (Dan 1999, p. 195; Kraus 2007, pp. 25-33). The fact that the childless Rebbe matches this description perfectly, and that in his old age he did not reprimand his followers who identified him as the Messiah - he even hinted that he might be such6 - led Dan, and following him Alon Dahan, to raise the possibility that the fact that the Rebbe had no children did not stem from a physiological problem. Dan determines unequivocally that: Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson could not establish a successor, neither in a physiological nor theological sense, without shattering the story of the 'seven leaders,' thereby denying his own destiny, which had been determined well before he took upon himself the mantle of Habad leadership. (Dan 1999, p. 195) Dahan offers a more detailed presentation, but reaches the same conclusion (Dahan 2008, pp. 293-296). He explains the myth of the dynasty of Habad leaders, according to which the leaders, as general souls, represent the Sefirot of the Godhead. According to this doctrine, Rabbi Israel Ba'al Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, represents the Sefirah of Keter or Hokhmah ; his student, the Maggid of Mezritch, is identified with the Sefirah of Binah ; and the founder of Habad Hasidism, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Lyadi, represents the Sefirah of Da' at. 6 A hint at such messianic self-understanding appears in one of the Rebbe' s Sihot from 27 Shevat, 5752, which the Rebbe ended by saying, "such shall it be for us, in actuality, really ( mamash ), quickly and immediately, in actuality, with all the interpretations of mamash, the word mamash understood in its simple meaning, mamash, mamash, mamash " ( Devar Malhut , Mishpatim, 9th Chapter, Third Gate, p. 1 1 , my emphasis). In adding "with all the interpretations of mamash The Rebbe seems to allude to the popular reading of the word as acronym of Menachem Mendel Schneerson. Springer</page><page sequence="6">116 Y.Bilu Following this logic through, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson represents the Sefirah of Malkhut , the tenth and final of the Sefirot, which in turn symbolizes exile and the end of days. This analysis became possible, according to Dahan, only after Schneerson appointed his predecessor, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak, whose years of leadership correspond to the Sefirah Hod , to a second period of leadership after Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak' s death (corresponding to the first years of the later Rebbe's own presidency), which would correspond with the ninth Sefirah, Yesod. While this extreme move was not announced explicitly by the Rebbe, Dahan notes that the Rebbe stated several times that the soul of his predecessor was united with his own, and that he demanded that the Hasidim attach themselves to Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak who, he claimed, continues to lead them as before. The appointment itself hints at the Rebbe's desire to speed up the redemption and to place himself on its threshold and testifies to his profound messianic conscious- ness. Furthermore, Dahan finds hints that the Rebbe maintained a deliberate discipline of sexual abstinence, which derived from that messianic consciousness (Ibid., pp. 306-309). Dan's and Dahan' s bold claim, that the Rebbe remained childless as a result of his deliberate mystic-messianic meditations, depends upon the assumption that the Rebbe's messianic vision had driven him for many years, long before he took the position of leadership of the Habad movement. The Rebbe himself made such a claim (Ibid., p. 243), but the "elusive years" of his younger life weaken the claim. After his marriage, the young Schneerson distanced himself from his father-in-law's court, and during the 1930s he studied science and engineering in Berlin and Paris, while looking for work as an engineer in France (Heilman and Friedman 2010, pp. 83-148). Is it possible that during this period, when he was not identified as his father-in-law's future successor, he maintained a discipline of sexual abstinence due to his messianic vision and fervor? When he became the leader of the movement in 1951, a year after his father-in-law's death, the Rebbe was already almost 50 years old, and his wife was even older, certainly no longer of childbearing age. Following Heilman and Friedman, who noted that in Paris "the anxiety of their childlessness weighed heavily on the couple and their parents" (2010, p. 128), one could claim that it was not his messianic consciousness that led the Rebbe-to-be to be childless, but the opposite; his lack of children accelerated the development of his own messianic consciousness. In either case, it remains certain that the Rebbe did not appoint a successor for himself, whether one from within the family or outside it, a fact which supports the claim that he saw himself, at least toward the end of his life, as the one assumed to be the Messiah.7 Despite the significant role that the Rebbe's childlessness might have played in constructing his status as the final Redeemer, I did not find in the messianic writings 7 Wolfson (2009) and Dahan (2010) claim that the Rebbe's image of the redemption was less focused on his own personality, and more on raising the messianic spark in each and every one of his Hasidim and in the rest of the Jewish collective. Indeed, the Rebbe expected that "revealing the uniqueness of the soul of each and every Jew - that is the messianic parts in each and every member of the Jewish people - . . . that will reveal the collective Messiah" (Devar Malhut, Korah , 28 Sivan, 5751, 19). Putting the responsibility on the community, within the expectation that each Jew will rise up and become Messiah-like in the messianic age, might also explain why he did not appoint a successor. Also see Garb (2005, p. 127). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="7">Childlessness, Procreation, and Creation in Messianic Habad 117 an explicit discussion of his childlessness. Also, the meshichist activists who I interviewed also did not bring up this topic of their own initiative. In and of itself, this is not surprising. When I encouraged one interviewee to talk about the issue, he explained that the Hasidim hesitate to discuss it due both to "their fear of heaven," their concern about boldly trespassing on the Rebbe's intimate life, as well as "a son's love for his father" that prevents the son from raising sensitive and painful issues about the father. This latter image - that the one who refuses to discuss the Rebbe's childlessness is presented as his son - contains a certain internal contradiction, but fits nicely with the parallel Hasidic idea that all should view themselves as children of the Rebbe. Indeed, the claim that all Hasidim are the Rebbe's children surfaced regularly in interviews as a way of justifying the fact that the Rebbe was left without children. This also resonates with claims about the Rebbe's status as universal King Messiah. Not only would children-successors stand in tension with the apocalyptic foundations and eternality of the Rebbe as King Messiah, but the attention that children require within the immediate family is inconsistent with the total dedication and absolute commitment which the messianic figure must bring to spreading the message of salvation at the spiritual and public levels (a dedication and commitment which, according to his followers, the Rebbe fully possessed). In any case, the question which will occupy us as we proceed touches on the messianic climate, which allows the crossing of epistemological borders from viewing the Rebbe as the metaphoric father of the Hasidim to a mental region where the father image becomes more concrete. Contrary to some of the Hasidim interviewed by Dahan (2008, p. 292), the majority of the meshichist interviewees did not accept a natural explanation of the Rebbe's childlessness, disconnected from the messianic context. They repeated the theme that "everything is calculated." One even presented the Rebbe's childlessness as the end of a three-generation historical drama, which had been determined from above. As opposed to the first four leaders, who had many children, Rabbi Shalom DovBer had no children for quite some time before his only son, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak, was born. The miraculous nature of the birth is emphasized in a story about a dream told by Rabbi Shalom DovBer' s wife, regarding three old men who came to visit her in her home. When she related the dream to her father-in-law, Rabbi Shmuel, he explained to her that the old men were his three predecessors - the "Old Rebbe" (Schneur Zalman), the "Middle Rebbe" (DovBer), and the "Tzemah Tzedek" (Menachem Mendel) - who came to tell her that she would be blessed with a son, much as the three angels had visited Abraham and Sara. Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak, the son, who was born following the dream, had three daughters but no sons; his son-in-law, Rabbi Menachem Mendel, who married the second of those three daughters, Chaya Moussia, and eventually became the seventh and final leader, had no children at all. The Childless Rebbe Provides Children Whatever the reason for the Rebbe's childlessness, this paper focuses on the dialectical relationship between the fact that the Rebbe himself was childless and â Springer</page><page sequence="8">118 Y.Bilu the reputation he developed as one whose blessing could provide fertility. We have mentioned the Rebbe's frequent miracles related to childbirth, but these stories focus not only on the frequency of the Rebbe's child-giving, but on other aspects as well. In many cases, the Rebbe made a married couple fertile after a long period of childlessness - eight, ten, and even twenty years - and even though the couple had consulted doctors and undergone frequent fertility treatments. In contrast to the lengthy and ineffective medical interventions, the Rebbe's blessing works immediately. In some cases the child is born after precisely nine months. The potency of the Rebbe's blessing is expressed also in multiple births - twins, triplets, or more. Sometimes this potency affects several women simultaneously or one after the other. This kind of collective pregnancy appears in the story of a spiritual advisor from B'nei Brak. Having been childless for ten years, she took it upon herself to organize Torah classes for women in a similar situation, in order to make them worthy of "live and established seed and to hasten the true and complete redemption." The number of participants in these Torah classes gradually reached forty. At this point, the holy blessing [through the Iggrot Kodesh ] of the Rebbe shlita [acronym for 'may he be worthy of a long and good life,' a common accolade for a great living Rabbi] arrived: 4 Blessing and wishes that each and every one , may she live , shall be blessed with live and established seed' Within a few months, good news began to pour in, including the birth of healthy children, one after the other. Those involved clearly saw that the blessing of the Rebbe shlita , the King Messiah, had been fulfilled (emphasis in original). When word spread about the success, another female activist decided to establish a similar class in her town of Kiryat Gat, which attracted "a number of couples in the town who for years were desperately waiting for children." After the first class, she recalls: I wrote a letter to the Rebbe shlita, King Messiah, and inserted the names of the participants in Iggrot Hakodesh, and I emphasized that we are requesting a promise that each and every one of the women would be worthy of live and established seed. I quickly received a wondrous response: ' May it be His will that this promise shall be kept for each and every one , completely.... And mazal tov to the sons' From that moment on, we knew that we were on the right track. The good news came quickly: "The most important and joyous thing is the fact that since the holy blessing of the Rebbe shlita, King Messiah, several of the participants have been blessed with children" (Sihat HaGeulah, 211, 8/21/1998, 4; emphasis in the original). The connection between the birth of children and the appearance of the redemption, which was emphasized in the initiative in B'nei Brak, receives here a theological rationale, based on the commentary of Rashi regarding the statement of the Sages that "the Messiah son of David does not come until all the souls in the body have been completed" (BT Avodah Zarah 5a). Rashi explains that, "There is a storehouse called the body, and at the time of creation all of the souls which will be born in the future were formed and put there." Several of the interviewees â Springer</page><page sequence="9">Childlessness, Procreation, and Creation in Messianic Habad 119 connected the Rebbe's numerous miracles regarding fertility with his standing as the Messiah. His actions were designed to hasten the redemption by bringing about a situation in which all of the supernal Jewish souls would be born. In the Rebbe's thought, the redemption itself is perceived as a cosmic birth.8 In the story, "When the Miracles Roll," emphasizing the ways in which the blessing for fertility "rolls" among infertile women, familiar objects within Habad messianic ecology appear, particularly the "dollar of blessing." Such dollars - which the Rebbe would personally distribute on Sundays to those who gathered at "770," in order that they use the money for charity - circulate widely even today, and they serve an important function in alleviating a wide range of problems and troubles. As such, they are true indexical representations of the Rebbe, much like his Torah scroll, the chair upon which he sat, the goblet upon which he blessed, the ritual bath in which he bathed, the etrog in his sukkah , and other similar objects. These items make the Rebbe present not only because he owned or used them, but more importantly because they preserve the touch of his body (this is particularly clear regarding the mikveh water in which he immersed himself). Such objects, along with iconic images of the Rebbe such as photographs or films of the farbrengens (Hasidic gatherings) over which he presided, are part and parcel of a wide variety of ritual practices of embodiment or re-presenting. In these ceremonial practices, the Rebbe plays the role of an active participant, much as he did during the period of his actual leadership. Hence, the Rebbe continues to be called to prayers (and he is regularly called to the Torah, as well) and is invited to farbrengens and celebrations such as weddings. Dollars continue to be distributed in his name on Sundays, and pieces of cake and cups of wine ostensibly coming from him are distributed at the gatherings following Shabbat and holidays. This thick ritual-messianic ecology helps the Hasidim overcome the fact that, since the third of Tammuz 5754, the Rebbe has been hidden from them. They can continue to be with the Rebbe and to "live" the Rebbe - to feel his close presence, particularly in his house in Crown Heights, but also in other places (Kravel-Tovi 2009; Kravel-Tovi and Bilu 2008). In the following example, when a young and childless neighbor speaks about her problems, the narrator recalls the "dollar of blessing" which she has in her possession. Her suggestion points to the ritualized nature of the petition to the Rebbe: I explained to her in clear words the virtues [of the dollar], and I suggested that she hold the dollar and look at the picture of the Rebbe shlita, King Messiah , 8 The expression "birth pangs of the Messiah" hints at the connection between birth and redemption. In Sihat HaGeulah of the weekly portion of Tazria, the editor, quoting the Rebbe, explicitly makes the equation between birth and redemption and, more specifically, between the delivery of a male child and the coming of the Messiah. The Rebbe is quoted (without reference) as saying, "It is known that birth hints at redemption (as it says in the verse, 'Zion has given birth to her sons'), and birth of male children hints at the strengthening of the power of the true and complete redemption, an eternal redemption after which there is no more exile ('a new song,' stated in the verse in masculine), brought about by our righteous Messiah. Thus, the verse 'and she shall give birth to a boy,' hints at the birth (revelation) of the soul of the Messiah, which is at a particularly high level, coming from [the Kabbalistic] World of the Male" ( Sihat HaGeulah, 643, 4/20/2010, 1, emphasis in the original).

Not only did the neighbor become pregnant quickly and give birth to a son, but as a result many other women in need came, and they all had children. Another woman arrived, and she also held on to the dollar of blessing, looked at the [picture of the] King Messiah , requested a blessing, and.... at the next meeting already told me the "good news." And then another one, and then another one, with God's help. The chain ended with a friend from work, who had been childless for more than a dozen years. Nine months after the ritual petition from the Rebbe, she also had a son. (Sihat HaGeulah , 786, 2/19/2010, 3, emphasis mine) Looking at the picture of the King Messiah fulfills an important function in the cult of the Rebbe, particularly in miraculous stories which relate to childbirth. In the context of the unprecedented visual culture which has developed in messianic Habad (Balakirsky Katz 2007, 2010), this cult has reached levels of iconophilia, grounded in mutual gazing. Did this kind of mutual gazing, in which both the petitioner and the Rebbe look at one another, occur in the story of the dollar of blessing? It is believed that the potency of the Rebbe' s sharp gaze, which during his life could even revive those on their deathbed {Sihat HaGeulah, 380, 1/18/2002, 3; Sihat HaGeulah , 383, 2/8/2002, 3), is preserved in his pictures after his disappearance. The hypnotic power of the Rebbe's gaze, the compulsion to look back at the picture, and the expressive quality of his piercing blue eyes, which seem to send a clear message, amounting sometimes to a kind of speech - all were common themes in the stories and interviews. "The Picture with the Baby" The central photo in Habad' s visual cult is directly connected to nursing. Habad' s hagiography highlights the great emphasis which the Rebbe placed on educating Habad children, their role in bringing the redemption, the attention and fatherly love which he showered on them, and his enthusiasm for addressing them directly at summer camps, conferences, and parades (Kraus 2007, pp. 183-223). On one of these occasions in 1977, as the Rebbe was observing a student Lag Ba'omer parade, he was photographed as he hailed the marchers with a glance and an encouraging wave of the hand. This photo became very popular, and it gained iconic status in Habad' s visual culture (Balakirsky Katz 2007, p. 70). In Israel, the photo gained popularity during the Rebbe's life and was printed on billboards, distributed in hundreds of thousands of copies, and published in public relations materials ("A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words," Sihat HaGeulah , 26, 1/6/1995, 4). Since the Rebbe's disappearance, the picture's popularity has only grown, and it appears prominently in public places, in Habad institutions, on messianic publications, and on the walls of the homes of Hasidim. The mythical aura that surrounds this picture developed further when some began to find in it hidden faces, similar to the hidden faces in images of Christian saints (cf. Belting 1994, Morgan 1998, 2005): â Springer</page><page sequence="11">Childlessness, Procreation, and Creation in Messianic Habad 121 This picture, which is referred to as the "picture with the baby," earned its name because of an interesting photographic effect. When one looks at the fingers of the [Rebbe' s] waving hand, one sees an almost perfect image of a cute baby's face... Interestingly, the Rebbe, our righteous Messiah, had declared that year as the year of the child, which was to be dedicated to the topic of educating Jewish boys and girls on the path of faith and Hasidism. {Sihat HaGeulaĶ 26, 1/6/1995, 4) Another issue describes the child's face: The picture has been called "the picture with the baby's face," since an examination of the Rebbe' s open hand reveals the image of the face of a sweet baby, with black eyes, a cute and pug nose, a small mouth, and round cheeks. 0 Sihat HaGeulaĶ 476, 12/12/2003, 3) There have been various speculations regarding the identity of the baby. Befitting a universal messianic vision, some identify the Rebbe' s wave of the hand as a blessing for the future of humanity, as exemplified by the baby who emerges from the hand (Balakirsky Katz 2007, p. 70). Others claim that the picture represents the image of the Rebbe' s own face when he was an infant. But the most common explanation is that the image represents the baby who was or will be born to childless couples who had asked the Rebbe for a blessing for children. As I will try to argue in the conclusion, the messianic imagination might connect the last two explanations. The next story explicitly connects the "picture with the baby" to the way that the Rebbe' s blessing cures infertility. A thirty-year-old woman, who had been childless for six years of marriage, and who according to the doctors had no chance of ever giving birth, poured out her troubled heart to a Habad woman. The latter informed her of the possibility of writing to the Rebbe by using the Iggrot Kodesh , and thereby having a child: I gave her a poster with a passage from Psalms and the Rebbe' s photo which I had put in our own son's stroller, and I pointed out to her that a picture of a baby emerged from his holy hand. A year later, the woman greeted her own son. ( Sihat HaGeulaĶ 394, 5/3/2002, 3) Between a Photo and Apparition A closer connection between the Rebbe' s picture and the theme of fertility appears in the story of a participant in a weekly class on Hasidism, who had communicated with the Rebbe through the Iggrot Kodesh and had requested an unspecified blessing. Much to her surprise, the Rebbe blessed her in reply with a healthy pregnancy and birth: "I don't understand. To the best of my knowledge, I am not pregnant," she said to the teacher of the class, who rebuffed her doubts. "If the Rebbe shlita , the King Messiah, wrote to you as a pregnant woman, then you are pregnant, and you have nothing to worry about, since he blessed you that everything should be smooth and easy." ^ Springer</page><page sequence="12">122 Y. Bilu Indeed, she became pregnant shortly afterwards, but the pregnancy came with complications which led her to have an ultrasound in the hospital. The results were unambiguous: the fetus had died and needed to be removed surgically. When the woman heard the news, "She returned home crying and confused. 'How could that be? I was told of a healthy pregnancy and an easy birth, which means a living and healthy child. What happened here?'" The teacher came to comfort her. "You have an explicit promise, and you have nothing to worry about." When the woman arrived at the hospital she was sent for another ultrasound prior to the operation. Much to her surprise and wonder, "When the nurse began to prepare the ultrasound machine, I suddenly saw on the wall across from the bed the Rebbe shlita , King Messiah, with his hat and blue eyes. With a wide smile, he told me, 'Don't worry. Everything will be okay.'" As she tried to absorb this vision, the nurse surprised her with the news that the fetus was alive and breathing, and that she could go home. Three months later, the narrator gave birth to a healthy baby girl. But the story does not end there. During the weekly class one of the women mentioned, "as she pointed to the giant picture of the Rebbe on the wall," that "in the Rebbe's hand there is the image of the face of a baby." The narrator and her friend began to scream: "That is just how my daughter looks, with those cheeks..." (Sihat HaGeulah, 533, 2/4/2005, 3, my emphasis). This complex story needs to be read closely. First, it teaches something about Habad messianic epistemology, according to which, when there is a contradiction between the Rebbe' s answer in the Iggrot Kodesh and the apparent reality, the holy words of the Rebbe are viewed as absolutely valid (Bilu 2009, pp. 195-197). The Rebbe' s words are prior to and even create the facts. This becomes clear both from the teacher's firm response to the gap between the Rebbe' s blessing of pregnancy and the absence of signs of pregnancy, and also from the interaction between the teacher and the upset woman, faced with the contradiction between the blessing of a healthy pregnancy and the difficult reality of the first ultrasound. More important for our purposes are the two instances of making the Rebbe visually present, in both apparition and picture, and the relationship between that and the blessing of fertility. The climax of the story is the Rebbe' s appearance before the narrator in the examination room. This is a dramatic experience but not idiosyncratic or uncommon in Habad' s messianic climate, given the very many reports of the Rebbe' s apparitions to fully conscious men and women. These apparitions can be divided by context into two categories: (1) "Ritual apparitions," which generally occur in 770, or sometimes in Habad houses in Israel or other countries during prayers and holidays, a time when the Rebbe' s presence is particularly felt, (2) "Mundane apparitions," which occur in ordinary, non-ritual settings often during a time of crisis. This story belongs in the second category and demonstrates the close connection between pictures and revelation. Despite Habad' s vast visual culture, pictures are not a necessary condition for apparitions. Still, the ubiquity in the messianic landscape of pictures and video clips of the Rebbe makes him particularly visible and fixes his image in the mind of the Hasidim as a salient visual schema that can be easily retrieved. There is not a great distance between accessing the mental image of the Rebbe and experiencing him as revealing himself, particularly when the revelation is mediated through techniques of visualization, which are â Springer</page><page sequence="13">Childlessness, Procreation, and Creation in Messianic Habad 123 commonplace in Habad. Given the richness of Habad methods to make the Rebbe present and the diverse background of those who see the Rebbe and continue to function normally, it seems that in Habad' s messianic climate we should understand apparitions as reflecting normal cognitive processes, rather than as a symptomatic expression of deep psychological distress (hallucinations). The story, "Revelation in the Examination Room," adds a significant layer to the connection between pictures and apparitions. The fact that the Rebbe appeared on the wall perhaps hints at the subjective process in which the picture's two-dimensional image becomes a three-dimensional figure in the apparition. This transformation was made explicit in an interview with a newly observant woman who recalled how she had turned to the giant picture of the Rebbe in her living room with a request for help, and was shocked to see him step out of the picture and stand beside her for a short time. The fact that in our story the Rebbe on the wall speaks to the narrator brings us toward another group of stories which blur the connection between photo and revelation, stories in which the Rebbe speaks from inside his picture. Beyond the connection between the picture and apparitions, for our purposes it is important to focus on the excited reaction of the young mother and her friend to the large picture of the Rebbe with the baby. I would like to suggest that the resemblance between the daughter who was born as a result of the Rebbe' s blessing and the "Rebbe' s child" in the hand may give an inkling of the mother's fantasy that the Rebbe is the baby's father. Two more stories will help expand on this possibility. "The King Messiah's Baby" The first story, "The King Messiah's Baby," appeared in Sihat HeGeulah (299, 6/8/ 2000, 3) and in a more detailed form (which will be analyzed here) in the collection entitled To Open the Eyes (pp. 126-130). This story is one of the most complicated in the corpus of miracle stories, both in terms of the plot development and of the diverse ways in which the Rebbe is made present. The story's protagonists are a young newly observant Sephardic couple from Herzilya. When doctors told them that "as a result of serious medical complications, they will be unable to have children," they began writing to the Rebbe using the Iggrot Kodesh. In response, they were told to be very careful about the laws of "family purity." Though they heeded these words, their request was not granted, and, having given up hope, they began the process of adopting a child. Under these circumstances, when the frustrated husband began to doubt the messianic status of the Rebbe, he was visited by the Rebbe in a dream. I entered the holy room of the Rebbe shlita , King Messiah, for an individual meeting iyehidut) with him. I stood next to the Rebbe shlita , King Messiah, and even touched him. I felt the warmth of his holy body. Overcome by emotion, I began to shiver and cry uncontrollably. Through my tears, I asked the Rebbe shlita if he was King Messiah and I requested a son. The Rebbe shlita , King Messiah, responded to me, The wellsprings shall burst forth.' Ö Springer</page><page sequence="14">124 Y. Bilu The individual meeting with the Rebbe, echoing the famous encounter of the Baal Shem Tov with the Messiah,9 is rich with expressions of intimacy and ends with deep emotional catharsis. The speculative nature of psychodynamic hypotheses notwithstanding, it is still tempting to suggest that the latent content of the dream experience alludes to homoerotic urges, given the intimacy of the meeting, the physical touch, the heat, and the ecstatic shivering. The expression of wellsprings bursting forth, as an image of male potency, fits within this framework, especially given the request for a male child. When the dreamer learned about the notion of wellsprings bursting forth in Hasidism, he established a website to spread Hasidic teachings, and he even adopted Hasidic dress and appearance. At the same time, his wife also experienced "a special dream of the Rebbe shlita , King Messiah, in which he passed a baby to her and informed her that she would give birth in the month of Tishrei." Dreams in which the Rebbe passes a baby to the believer have recurred in other stories as well. In this case, the promise in the dream was reinforced in the Iggrot Kodesh : "May it be God's will that He will fulfill his heart's request, as well as the request of his wife's heart, and she shall have live and established seed soon, in actuality." Still, the couple remained disheartened, and their frustration grew as the months passed. Under these circumstances, the husband experienced another meeting with the Rebbe, this time while he was awake. One evening in the month of Shevat 5759, at approximately 9:30 PM, I returned home from my weekly class [on Hasidism]. I went into the building and began climbing the stairs to my apartment. Suddenly, I felt that somebody was standing behind me and looking at me. I turned and stood silent, disbelieving what I was seeing. The Rebbe shlita , King Messiah, stood there in the stairwell, looking at me with a penetrating gaze, examining my innermost thoughts [bohen kelayot valev]. In his left hand, the Rebbe shlita, King Messiah, held a small baby, with blond hair, blue eyes, and light skin. The baby, too, looked at me. I was filled with fear and terror. I do not know how long I stood there, but then I fled upward, entered my apartment, and closed the door behind me. Here we have an apparition of the second, mundane kind, just like its predecessor. It occurs unexpectedly, in an ordinary space, and creates a feeling of fear and terror. But the message is clear, and it echoes the woman's dream. The fulfillment of the repeated promises - in the letters, in the dreams, and in the apparition - came quickly: On Sunday the 23rd of Tishrei, 5760, we became parents to a healthy baby. When I went to see my wife and the baby, I was shocked to see that this child 9 In this story, the Ba'al Shem Tov asks the Messiah when he will reveal himself and receives the following answer: "When your teachings will become publicized and revealed in the world and your wellsprings shall burst forth." Thus, the Rebbe' s similar answer in this meeting in the dream is, in and of itself, a positive answer to the Hasid's question as to whether the Rebbe is the Messiah. See Shivei HaBesht (1975). â Springer</page><page sequence="15">Childlessness, Procreation, and Creation in Messianic Habad 125 looked just like the baby which the Rebbe shlita , King Messiah, had held in his holy hand nine months previously! This story does not mention the picture of the "Rebbe with the baby." Still, it seems possible that the baby who the Rebbe held in his hand was understood in the protagonist's imagination to be the Rebbe' s own child, both because he looked like the Rebbe and because he was given the Rebbe' s own name, Menachem Mendel. I would like to suggest that the baby with the Rebbe' s name, who shares the Rebbe' s blue eyes, light hair, and light skin, and who like the Rebbe, stares at the narrator, is in fact the very image of the Rebbe, writ small.10 The Baby in the Hand The last story to be discussed here returns us to the explicit connection between the picture of the Rebbe with the baby and the granting of children. The story tells of a woman from the town of Bat Yam in her seventh month of pregnancy. The doctors suggested she end her pregnancy since they suspected the baby had Down Syndrome. She returned home upset, and "prayed in her heart - from whence shall my help come?" As she fell asleep, immersed in painful thoughts, she saw the Rebbe in a dream. In her dream she saw herself across a large, long table, full of good food, with the Rebbe shlita , King Messiah, sitting at the head. "Though I had never seen him face to face, I recognized him instantly. His picture appears everywhere," she said later on. "He looked at me and said that I have nothing to worry about and everything will work out. Then he stretched out his hand and spread out his palm and fingers. A great light burst forth, and from it emerged... a baby. I became very excited, and when I turned around to leave, he turned to me and said: 'Wait. You have a happy and healthy child; you will give birth normally.'" Though the story does not explicitly mention the picture with the baby, there is no doubt that this picture served as inspiration for the emergence of the baby from the hand in the dream narrative. The dream's promise was indeed fulfilled two months later, when the woman gave birth to a healthy baby boy. Shortly after the birth, the Rebbe appeared to her again in a dream: "You see, the birth was fine. You see that you have a healthy son, and he will be one of my Hasidim." Indeed, the baby maintained a special relationship with the Rebbe. "His stroller and crib contain many pictures of different rabbinic figures, but he was only interested in the picture of the Rebbe shlita, King Messiah. He would pick it up and kiss it." The baby's particular fondness for the Rebbe should come as no surprise, since in the dream the baby had emerged from the Rebbe' s very hand.11 Whether to soften the concrete image of male giving birth, or to highlight it, the editor emphasized in the opening 10 The couple's other children, a son and a daughter, were born after the woman dreamed that she received the Rebbe' s blessing while waiting on line to receive a dollar. The daughter was named Haya Mushka, after the Rebbe's wife ( Sihat HaGeulah, 432, 1/31/2003, 3). 1 1 The connection between birth and creation in the dream is strengthened by the image of light which surrounds the hands. In the dream, the light emerges first from the Rebbe's hands, and the child emerges Ô Springer</page><page sequence="16">126 Y. Bilu of the story the general connection between the Rebbe and every Jew, wherever he may be. One of the primary characteristics of the leader of the Jewish people is the connection that he has with each and every Jew. It really is like that. He is connected and unified with each individual, without distinguishing between them. When this connection is revealed each time anew, someone experiences a salvation in his life. (Sihat HaGeulah, 432, 3/31/2003, 3) In this story, the dream emphasizes a connection between a child and his progenitor. Discussion: Between Birth and Creation The stories discussed here are important not merely because of the faith in the Rebbe' s power to grant children to those who ask for his blessing. This contribution, after all, is the basic obligation of the leader of any Hasidic group to his followers. The dialectical process, which gives the power to grant children to the childless Rebbe, is also common in the hagiographie logic.12 Still, the stories before us grow in a "hot" messianic climate, in which the Rebbe is described as the universal Savior, who lives an eternal life, and as a kind of supernal essence which has taken on a bodily form. The mystical conception of the tzaddik grants him a place within the system of the Godhead, but the lofty metaphysical status of the King Messiah blurs even further the boundaries between him and the upper worlds.13 These stories open a window onto the ways in which the messianic imagination makes this status present and translates its power into practical action. In these stories, particularly those which reflect special states of consciousness such as dreams and visions, the boundaries between birth and creation are blurred. We will now examine the more concrete expressions of the Rebbe' s power to grant fertility in light of his status in Habad's mystical theosophy, while seeking to understand them at the psycho- cultural level. It is worth emphasizing the fact that in many of these stories the Rebbe' s image is present in a very concrete way, particularly given that the Rebbe's miracle stories deal with the period after his "occlusion" on the third of Tammuz, 5754. The standard procedure for appealing to the Rebbe is through the oracle of the Iggrot Footnote 11 continued from the light. Creation of light is the first event in the biblical story of creation, while the creation of man closes that story. 12 A common hagiographical motif concerns saintly figures who developed reputations as miracle workers precisely in areas in which they themselves were lacking. For example, in contemporary Israel's cult of tzaddikim, Yonatan Ben Uziel, buried according to popular belief at Amuka near Tzefat, plays a major role in matchmaking, despite (or because of) the fact that according to the tradition he had been single his entire life. The matriarch Rachel, to whom many turn with problems of fertility and childbirth, had been childless for some time and died giving birth to her son, Benjamin. 13 Publications of more radical meshichist groups, in the possession of the author, address the Rebbe with the following declaration: "May the honorable and holy Rebbe, our master, our teacher, and our Rabbi, King Messiah, live forever, the very essence of the Blessed One, our Creator, our Maker, our Redeemer." Ô Springer</page><page sequence="17">Childlessness, Procreation, and Creation in Messianic Habad 127 Kodeši i, in which the Rebbe's response is textually mediated. But in many stories the Rebbe's picture plays a central role. Sometimes this involves the pictures without: on the wall of a house, on a video screen, in the pocket or wallet; at other times it is the pictures within : the image of the Rebbe which is carried in the consciousness and imagination of the believers (though the external pictures of the Rebbe nourish this internal imagery). The stories in which the Rebbe appears and is seen in a concrete and tangible way allow us to understand the ways in which the Hasidim imagine the Rebbe's intervention which grants them children.14 These stories identify two of the Rebbe's body parts as being linked with his intervention: his eyes and his hands. Even during his life, there were many stories about the power of the Rebbe's blue eyes. His gaze was described as penetrating, piercing, hypnotizing, shocking, electrifying, and even life restoring. Messianic Habad' s iconophilia implies that the same powers can be granted to the Rebbe's eyes in a photo. From a psychoanalytic perspective, admittedly speculative, the penetrating and forceful nature of his glance in these stories seems to convey phallic-sexual implications. Freud emphasizes the symbolic parallel between the eye and the male sexual organ in his classic analysis of the myth of Oedipus, in which blinding oneself is interpreted as castration (Freud 1954 [1900]). But one can see similar themes in the Midrash15 and in Kabbalistic sources, as Wolfson has shown (Wolfson 1994, p. 104; Wolfson 2009, p. 366, n. 143). The Rebbe's penetrating glance focuses on men too, in ways that arguably have a homoerotic element, such as in the story of the man meeting alone with the Rebbe in the story entitled "The Baby of the King Messiah." But it is important to point out that in that story the woman also receives a baby from the Rebbe's hand. The Rebbe's blessing of fertility affects men and women alike, thus blurring gender boundaries in ways that may be related to the unique ontological status of the King Messiah. The Rebbe's waving hand, the limb which plays the central role in the fertility stories, may also be interpreted psychoanalytically as a symbolic expression of phallic potency. In the iconic picture, the baby in the Rebbe's hand strengthens the connection between the hand and fertility. Emerging from the Rebbe's hand, the baby palpably appears as the Rebbe's offspring. Indeed, sources from the messianic 14 Pictures can express subversive or antinomian content that cannot easily be articulated verbally or in writing. In this example, we are speaking about a process of aggrandizement of the Rebbe's image as the ultimate Redeemer, to the point of making him divine. For example, in each issue of the radically messianic magazine Ezrahim Bimedinat Hamashiach ("Citizens in the Messiah's State") the front cover shows a picture of the Rebbe looking down upon a panoramic view from on high. The Rebbe's place in heaven gives him an almost divine status. The visual presentation does not make this explicit, avoiding the blatant and controversial equation of the Rebbe with the creator (such as "Long live our Master, our Teacher, and our Creator"). Dreams and revelations based upon visual presentations can play a similar symbolic function, as we learned from Freud. My thanks go to Ganit Ankory for pointing this out to me. 15 The Mishna connects blindness with a punishment for sinful male sexual desire. In discussing Samson, it states: "Samson followed his eyes, and therefore the Philistines poked out his eyes" (Mishna Sotah 1:8). The Midrash makes the symbolic equation in the context of sexual self-control. "Rabbi Matia ben Harash saw a beautiful woman and was concerned that his desire would get the best of him. He took a white-hot nail and poked out his eyes" (Midrash Tanhumah, Vol. 2, "Addition to Parshat Hukkat Based on the Second Oxford Manuscript," 138; Yalkut Shimoni, Genesis, 247, 181). My thanks go to Tzvi Mark for pointing me to these two sources. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="18">128 Y. Bilu circles in Habad emphasize the penetrating masculine power of the King Messiah.16 But, even with these sources, there is more to the symbolism of the picture with the baby then merely viewing the hand as a symbol of male potency.17 The baby is located in the hand, and, at least in the last story, is presented as emerging from (being born from) inside it. In the experience of believers, the Rebbe appears both as one who gives fertility to others, but also as one who is himself fertile and even pregnant. The visual image of the child emerging from the iconic picture of the Rebbe - which echoes the dreams, visions, and inner lives of believers - appears related to the theme of "male birth." This theme, recurring in myths and folklore, identifies the creative process of birth with masculinity (Bilu 2003) and is expressed boldly in these stories. If Midrashic and mystical sources emphasize the idea that teaching Torah is comparable to childbirth, and if similar pseudo-procreation ideas appear in other cultures, then here we are dealing with an example of more literal childbirth. This is not a metaphorical childbirth, in which male creation (equated with cultural creativity) takes the place of the lesser female creation, namely childbirth (Hiatt 1971; Shapiro and Linke 1996). In the messianic imagination, the baby can be born from the Rebbe' s very hand, much as Athena emerged from the head of Zeus and Eve was created from the rib of Adam (Dundes 1976). The association in the popular imagination of the Rebbe with both male and female functions fits neatly with his identification with Sefirat Malkhut in the Godhead (Dahan 2006, pp. 205-235; Weil 2009, p. 75). Malkhut is a strictly feminine Sefirah, which absorbs and contains the divine overflow from the higher divine structure. Yet, it also acts in a masculine way, as its name suggests, controlling and holding power over the world below it. Dahan points to the parallels between the dual nature of Sefirat Malkhut and the dual gender tendencies in the personality and activities of the Rebbe. On the one hand, he took a stance of complete self-deprecation relative to the previous leaders of Habad, in particular his father-in-law. On the other hand, he assumed the role of leader of the people of Israel, charged with the task of "imposing the authority of God and the Torah upon the earth and all it contains, with complete authority" (Dahan 2008, p. 227). Following Dahan, we have mentioned that the Rebbe appointed his father-in-law, after the latter' s death, to a second term as leader, thereby making him the leader of the ninth generation, such that the Rebbe himself would become the personal representative of Sefirat Malkhut , which is associated with the tenth and final generation. This move, which developed in the context of known mystical claims that the soul of a presiding Hasidic tzaddik includes the souls of all of his predecessors, here reaches its culmination: by appointing his deceased father-in-law 16 The editor of Sihat HaGeulah cites the statement of the Sages, "The male ( zakhar ) way is to conquer" (in the original, "the man's [ish] way is to conquer," BT, Mo' ed Qatan 28a), and explains that "[t]his trait is particularly required of the Rebbe shlita, King Messiah, in order to fulfill his task, [which is] to conquer the world [and lead it] to serve God." The editor also distinguishes between the previous Rebbe' s efforts to maintain the spark of Jewishness and the Rebbe's task, which is "not to fight to maintain what exists, but rather bursting forth , with the power of the divine message, and the conquest of the entire world" {Sihat HaGeulah , 643, 4/20/2007, 1, emphasis mine). 17 The symbolic parallel between the hand and the phallus appears in the Midrash which describes how Yosef confronts his desire for the wife of Potifar. "He dug his hands into the earth, and his semen emerged from under his fingernails" (BT Sotah 36b). Yosef is identified with the phallic Sefirat Yesod. â Springer</page><page sequence="19">Childlessness, Procreation, and Creation in Messianic Habad 129 as leader (implicitly inhabiting the Rebbe' s own body), the Rebbe turned himself into the existential extension of his predecessor. In the context of the suggestive notion of Kabbalistic ibbur (impregnation), in which a soul becomes dressed up into the body of another, we will mention that appointing the father-in-law as leader of the ninth generation associated him with the male Sefirah , Yesod, the phallic component in the Kabbalah's anthropomorphic vision of the Godhead.18 In more general terms, the integration of masculinity and femininity in the upper worlds reflects an androgynous, double-faced image of God {du partzufin), which in many central mystical sources is understood as ideal (Idei 2010, pp. 161-191). In this context, it is important to mention Wolfson's claim that the messianic breaking of borders in the Rebbe' s thought includes the radical idea of a transition to an androgyny which rises above the oppositions between masculinity and femininity (Wolfson 2009, p. 220). With regard to the men and women whose stories are presented here, it is difficult to determine to what extent they are familiar with Habad' s theosophic mysticism in general, and the Rebbe' s messianic thought in particular. Still, the connection between the male and female functions of the Rebbe in these stories need not depend on a detailed acquaintance with Habad' s esoteric doctrine. In the fertility stories, the phallic quality in the Rebbe' s piercing gaze and waving hand, combined with the female ability to bear children who look like the Rebbe, hints at some vague understanding of fertility and childbirth in these cases as a process of self- creation. This is not far from the way the act of creation by forces in the upper worlds is understood. Are the believers' experiences, dreams, and visions driven by fantasies of the Rebbe as creator? Keep in mind that the childless Rebbe was understood as the "head of the People of Israel," the spiritual leader of all of the Jews, whose followers-emissaries are completely connected to him (Habadniks maintain that "the leader is everything"). It is no surprise that those followers describe his connection with them and with their offspring by using the idiom of father and children.19 Given the sense that Habad children are as attached to the Rebbe now as when he was alive, some interviewees were amazed that the next generation has developed "an independent and immediate relationship with the Rebbe" (in the words of one of the interviewees) though they had never met him. Meshichist fathers repeatedly declared that they worked hard to convey to their offspring that they are as much children of the Rebbe, "our father, our king," as they are children of their biological fathers. How much has this feeling transcended the level of verbal convention? The fertility stories discussed here, particularly those in which the Rebbe appears to his followers, whether in pictures or in visions, include several repeated themes: (1) The baby is born as a result of the Rebbe' s blessing, (2) The baby is located in 18 The mystical idea which connects the sixth and seventh Rebbes is spatially expressed in the Habad burial plots in the Montefiore Cemetery in Queens. The graves of the two Rebbes are side-by-side, while the graves of the wives are relatively distant. 19 The Rebbe refers to the students in Habad yeshivas as "my sons" (Sihat HaGeulah, 803, 6/25/2010, 3). He used similar terminology regarding his emissaries. When his wife's doctor called to report her death, his first reaction was, according to some reports, "We must tell the children, the emissaries" (Heilman and Friedman 2010, p. 222).

Bilu the Rebbe' s hand, and at times even emerges (is born) from within it, (3) The Rebbe passes the baby to the father or mother, (4) The baby looks like the Rebbe, (5) The baby receives the Rebbe' s name. It seems that, in the messianic discourse, the Rebbe reproduces himself through a process of self-creation rather than through sexual reproduction. The faith in the status of the Rebbe as the Messiah is congruent with his state of childlessness, in the sense that the Messiah lives eternally and is ever present among his followers. But the Rebbe' s disappearance on the third of Tammuz, 5754 left a painful vacuum which could have threatened his messianic identity. The numerous fertility-related miracles in messianic Habad not only contribute to bringing the redemption closer ("the Son of David does not arise until all of the souls in the body have been completed"), but also compensate for the fact that the Rebbe himself had no children. Some believers experience the Rebbe' s intervention in bringing children as if the Rebbe had fathered the children. The children become miniature replicas of the Rebbe. Two trends in messianic Habad might help to make this "reproduction theory" seem less speculative. First, the Rebbe is replicated in countless ways beyond the sphere of fertility. We have mentioned the iconophilia in Habad, which is supported by new visual technologies. These create a virtual Rebbe, albeit one accessible, visible, and portable, a Rebbe who is present in numerous images and presentations in the messianic ecology. These images appeared not only after the Rebbe' s disappearance, but even beforehand, when access to the Rebbe was also limited. During the later years of his leadership, "the years of salvation," the 1980s and 1990s, when messianic enthusiasm reached its climax, the elderly Rebbe rarely left his house, and even canceled the practice of meeting alone with individuals which had been one of the few opportunities for followers to meet with him face-to-face. Paradoxically, the new methods of making the Rebbe present transformed him after the third of Tammuz, 5754, into a hyper-visible and widely accessible figure. Or, in the language of the Hasidim themselves, the Rebbe is "with us more than ever."20 We have mentioned that some of the interviewees identified a three-generation process of decreasing numbers of children among Habad leadership; a process that began with the fifth Rebbe, Shalom DovBer, continued with his only son, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak, who had only daughters, and ended with the seventh, childless Rebbe. Yet, photographs of these leaders show the opposite trend. There is only one image of R. Shalom Dovber. Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak was immortalized in many pictures, but they hardly compare to the endless images of the Rebbe, the King Messiah. This phenomenon relates closely to the claim of art historian W.G T. Mitchell, who sees pictures as "vital signs, by which I mean not merely signs for living things but signs as living things" (Mitchell 2005, p. 6). Mitchell's bold claim, which refers to pictures in art in general, is relatively easier to apply when dealing with iconic pictures of saintly figures, since "[t]he image... not only represented a 20 In addition to the photos of the Rebbe, most of the other ways of making him present can be easily mass-produced, more so than when he was alive. The dollars that he distributed continue to circulate among believers, and new dollars are distributed in his name on Sundays at 770. They also help in performing miracles. The water from the Rebbe' s mikva is diluted with regular water and distributed; it loses none of its efficacy. Anyone in any place can use the Rebbe' s writings for the oracle of the Iggrot Kodesh, and they are guaranteed an immediate answer.

In fact, stories in which the Rebbe spoke from within the picture or emerged from the picture exemplify the picture as a kind of life form. Second, the idea that Hasidim see in the Rebbe an exemplary model of appropriate Hasidic behavior, which they try to imitate, is very common in Habad. Interviewees mentioned repeatedly that they try to be like the Rebbe, not necessarily in the physical sense - though the uniform Habad habitus assists in this as well - but as a deliberate process of identification. Learning his thought, trying to fulfill his will and follow his instructions are part of these attempts to emulate him. Recall that in the Rebbe' s view, the institution of shlihut (emissaryship) is the most important enterprise in preparing the ground for the redemption. The Rebbe defined the role of the emissary with a maximalist reading of the Halakhic concept that "a person's messenger is like him." According to the Rebbe, the emissary is supposed to identify completely with the one who sends him. As Kraus explains, "This identity is defined in Hasidic language as " bitul " [self- diminishing]. That is to say, the emissary abnegates his independent existence and identifies completely with the goals of the one who sends him, namely the Rebbe" (Kraus 2007, p. 115). At the end of the day, the Hasidim who try to "live the Rebbe" are the emissaries- representatives-presenters-sons of the missing Rebbe. They make him present through their actions. When an emissary in the southern settlement of Shibolim was asked about his work, he first explained that the word shabal (Shibol without vocalization) has the same numerical value as the name of the Rebbe shlita , King Messiah ( Sihat HaGeulah , 802, 6/18/2010, 4). The equivalence between the name of the place and the name of the Rebbe leads to a straightforward explanation of the larger goal of emissary's work: " to make many more Menachem Mendels , Shibol in plural, to bring satisfaction to the one who sent me." Many Hasidim are named Menachem Mendel, and in any given family with more than one male child, it is likely that one of them will have that name. Still, even those who have another name are often viewed as the Rebbe' s children and as his emissaries-representatives in the world.21 Elliot Wolfson, in a riveting account of the Rebbe' s messianic theosophy, claims that the Rebbe strove toward a messianic state of complete nullification of self and essence and a total obliteration of differentiations between God and the world, such that the world becomes an all-encompassing divinity. This contemplative under- standing of the messianic state emerges from the dialectical and paradoxical mysticism in Habad, the doctrine of the unification of opposites. Thus, if the Rebbe perceived himself as the Messiah, this view would be within an esoteric tradition which does not tend toward clarification or becoming exoteric, but rather remains a secret within a secret - a secret that can be revealed only on condition that it remains concealed. This perspective is a far cry from the way in which the meshichists interpret the Rebbe' s messianic enterprise. They offer a concrete 21 The Rebbe, backed by the Sages' statement "do not touch my anointed one" (BT Shabbat 119b), insists regularly that children should be educated such that "their entire existence is 'Messiah,'" and that "Jewish children of our generation are clearly particularly 'messianic.'" This also emphasizes that the Rebbe saw the children as his successors. ( Devar Malkhut , lectures delivered on the night of Simhat Torah prior to dancing, 5752, Ninth Chapter, Third Gate, 3-4). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="22">132 Y. Bilu interpretation that both denies his death, and is built on a messianism which can be measured by a defined historical timeframe, by objective criteria, and by the "signs of redemption" in the world. Wolfson perceives the meshichists' efforts to make the Rebbe present as a vulgarization of the Rebbe's esoteric messianic doctrine, and he claims that seeing the Rebbe in visions and apparitions is no less than spiritual blindness. This blindness causes them to miss the Rebbe's true esoteric vision since "true vision consists of seeing the invisible in the visible and not of seeing the nonvisible as visible" (Wolfson 2009, p. 276). Wolfson's elitist claim illustrates the gap between an esoteric messianic doctrine, which derives from a mystical theosophy replete with contradictions and paradoxes, and a folk messianism expressed in miraculous stories, dreams and visions, which sees the Rebbe, the King Messiah, as an all-powerful Redeemer. Still, if according to Wolfson the Rebbe saw himself less as a personal messianic figure, and more as one who strove to create a collective messianic consciousness which would encompass each and every one of his followers (and ultimately each and every Jew) by kindling the messianic spark in their souls, then it is possible that reproducing in this world "many Menachem Mendels" is the meshichists' concrete expression of the Rebbe's vision.
