The general is to exact the money and hand it over to the priest. But with regard to the rest (of the money), that from the volunteers, let individuals, of their own accord, hand it over to the priest. The priest is to give account to the Boule annually and to hand it over to the incoming priest. The epistatai are to record what the generals themselves got and the rest (that) whoever campaigns (got). And let the prytaneis in office during the month of Artemision hold a sacrifice for Enyalios. Sacri fice to Enyalios a boar, a dog, and a kid. If it is (so) counseled ... let the Boule start the procession and let as many hoplites as the Boule decides accompany the offerings. Build an oikos for Enyalios, whenever it is possible for the Boule to collect the money privately. Let the generals who do not exact the money from the soldiers be guilty of sacrilege against the god, and let him be liable. And the same applies (for) however many campaign at private expense. The general and the individuals are to deposit the money with the priest within a month of their arrival. Inscribe the decree on a stone stela and place it beside the altar of Enyalios. As the following epigraphic commentary makes clear, the stone's surface has suffered since Accame's time, much of the damage appearing to be the effects of water. Nevertheless, close examination of the stone and a good squeeze allow for clarification and confirmation of Accame's doubtful readings and restorations at several points. Many letters read clearly by Accame are now indistinct and some have been completely lost. These have been conventionally noted in the text and will not merit detailed commentary. For matters not touched upon below, see Accame. Line 1: Restored by analogy to a Lindian inscription adduced by Accame 221-222. The decree must, therefore, date to a time before the creation of the federated Rhodian state, whose executive officials, the mastroi, appear in the prescript of Rhodian decrees which post-date 408. Accame (222) dates the decree ca. 440-420 on the basis of the letter-forms and historical considerations .</page><page sequence="3">New Observations on the Lindian Cult-Tax for Enyalios 123 Line 2: Iota of introducer's name clearly discernable on squeeze. Lines 4-5: It seems likely that the last letter of the secretary's name appeared in the first stoichos of line 4. Blinkenberg, op. cit., restored Ay[a]cxpXoq as the proposer's name; cf. Accame Ay[6o0]cXpXo;. Line 6: Bottom of the right leg of the alpha in the deity's name can just be made out on the stone and squeeze. Line 7: -v'cxt clear on stone. Epsilon of ?K, difficult to make out for Accame and now essentially an indentation on stone, reveals its features more clearly on the squeeze. Tips of slanting hastas of kappa just discernable on stone and squeeze. Eta's upper left hasta and beginning of left portion of crossbar visible on squeeze. Accame read 6[oc]g[o-, but a right slanting hasta, visible only in streifiicht on stone and squeeze before the clear mu, is better positioned to be an alpha than a delta, producing 6]cg[o] Line 8: f i&amp;' ct clearly visible in streiflicht and faintly on squeeze. Line 9: Round depression approximately 5 cm before the clear terminal nu may represent the omicron of ?4K]o[6v. Line 10: t6[n]piyv - middle portion of very worn lower horizontal of zeta appears faintly on the squeeze. Cf. Cretan np86&amp;o and 6IK66&amp;o - IC IV 72, lines 8, 21 and 36-37; IC IV 78, line 5, etc. Line 11: crpxouy0- is relatively well preserved, with the last four letters clearly visible in streiflicht, and faintly on the squeeze. The subsequent characters have apparently suffered greatly since Accame's time, but the loop and hasta of rho at the end of the line appears clearly on the squeeze. Line 12: The left side of the infinitive's final omicron, mostly destroyed by a divot, is just discernable on the squeeze. Line 14: Accame's reading Xcoo- is crucial for any interpretation of the text and while he ultimately decided to publish the first letter after lambda as an omega, his notes betray some trepidation. In the commentary, he admits the possibility that the first letter after lambda could conceivably be an alpha, producing to &amp;it6 XziCv "the money from the (mercenary) soldiery",1 and although he eventually rejected this reading, Sokolowski has revived it, in modified form.2 But close inspection of the stone and its letterforms seems to vindicate Accame's judgment. The legs of our masons' omegas have deeply cut "feet", which are regularly and firmly planted on the ground line, but there are some exceptions, such as the second omega (fo)X') in line 33, which is not as deeply cut and lacks the defined feet of the omega of Fro60o immediately below in line 34. Moreover the longitudinal axis of the second omega in line 33 appears slightly "rotated", in a clockwise direction. This omega can be profitably compared with the doubtful letterform of line 14. It too lists to the right and lacks deeply cut feet. It is true that certain alphas cut by this mason also tend to lean right, such as the first alpha of G-CpUcwyo'v in line 11, but even the traces of very worn and "round" alphas, like that of t6cv in line 9, still retain a hint of their angular top and/or their cross-bar. No such traces are to be seen above the rounded top of the letter after lambda in line 14, nor is the stone above it gouged or worn. On the whole, omega is the preferable reading. Accordingly, there is no reference to either mercenary soldiers (kocXv) or loot (Xx(i)ov) in this line. Line 19: iota, alpha and rho of ifxpfji, apparently indistinct for Accame, stand out clearly on the squeeze, as does the final tau. Line 20: The circular outline of phi in ypw(povm, restored by Accame, is just discernable on the squeeze. Line 27: The name of the month, some of which was apparently clearer to Accame, is much fainter now, but on the squeeze, one can make out the apex and left leg of the initial alpha, confirming Accame's restoration [Ap]tzg[tiov. Fragment two, front face: Line 32: I was unable to detect any traces of this line, read by Accame along the broken upper edge of the stone. Line 33: Although the initial portions of this line were better preserved for Accame, the squeeze clearly confirms Accame's restorations near the end of the line. On the squeeze, both legs and apex of alpha stand out very clearly after tau of the article. Near the end of the line, the mason has crowded the final preserved letters of no~4[n-, with omicron somewhat better preserved in the upper half of the letter. Line 34: Accame dotted the second epsilon of the verb and could not see its theta. Both are clearer on the squeeze, the theta a shallow circular depression between the clearer sigma and omega, as Bliimel indicates. Delta has almost perished in a divot, but the slanting sides of the letter are visible on the squeeze. The following epsilon is clear in streiflicht and the line's final iota stands out clearly at the edge of the stone. We may therefore read: igtEcdow ? 6_ OX-ruxt, cf. Accame ?Oa[0]o) [6]? 'ntXicoct and Bliimel F'Ineow [8]i 6x2&amp;iccLi. Line 39: t5tc- clear on squeeze, but between this alpha and the last iota of the line, both of which are secure, little can be made out with certainty. The very top of the final iota of i6ioct may be at the same level as the apex of the faint but legible alpha. Lambda and iota of [Af]V6Oy have perished in a divot, but the long left leg of nu appears clearly on the squeeze. Line 44: Omicron is clear after the initial nu. Line 48: Before 6&amp;, tau's vertical and right horizontal tip are preserved on the squeeze before a perfectly clear omicron. The beginning of the line may therefore be read: ro 6? apy-Sptov; cf. Accame io] 6? expy-ptov. Right Face, Fragment 1: Line 52: The bottom of rho's hasta is visible on the squeeze, as read by Bluimel. Accame's historical commentary remains fundamental and, in general, his observations retain much of their cogency. Accordingly, the present study will limit itself to three areas: I) issues attending the inter 1 Accame, op. cit., p. 215. 2 Sokolowski, LSCG Suppl, p. 148, proposes ?nb ?,a(i)?v "from loot".</page><page sequence="4">124 M.

I. Payment of misthos at public or private expense and levying of the cult-tax This remarkable document records the institution or regularization3 of a tax to expand the cult of Enyalios in the Rhodian polis of Lindos and similar levies instituted to defray the costs of new or expanded cult activity appear elsewhere.4 To this end all Lindian soldiers who campaign from Lindos are bid to contrib ute one-sixtieth of their pay to Enyalios. Commentators had long presumed that the opening provisions of lines 6-10 differentiated between Lindians who fought in official campaigns accompanied by Lindian generals (6oict(xt) and those who sought mercenary service overseas (i'6ia).5 But Pritchett, focusing on the implication of the participle woowtcowv, argued that the communis opinio was mistaken and adduced epigraphic and literary testimonia establishing that the decree draws a distinction not between those serving on campaigns in public or private interest, but between those who serve in campaigns at public or private expense, i.e. 6tocdi( xt i6loxt (6awtvij). "The meaning seems to be that whereas the soldiers who serve at public expense are to have the assessment deducted from their pay by the general who then turns it over to the priest, those who serve voluntarily are to pay to the priest direct a sum equivalent to the one-sixtieth. Volunteers and those who serve for pay are both committed to paying the assessment, although strictly speaking the volunteers received no wages."6 The misthos (wage) of fifth century soldiers was a very modest subsidy, averaging perhaps as much as three obols,7 meant to subsidize the soldier's provender.8 Given the already small amount of money in the typical misthos, such an extra imposition by the state might seem burdensome, especially to volun teer citizen-soldiers who, as Pritchett notes, had already foregone their usual (higher) incomes during the campaign. This concern is mitigated to some extent by the likelihood that any such unpaid volunteers would most likely have been relatively wealthy. But a more serious difficulty arises when we consider that the decree clearly indicates, in four separate clauses (lines 6-10, 13-16, 23-24, 46-47), that those who campaigned from Lindos but were not paid at public expense nevertheless apparently could expect to receive payment for their service and were therefore liable to pay the tax to Enyalios, just as those who campaigned 6cctoidcwt.9 Thus both major lines of previous interpretation encounter separate difficulties. The majority opinion does not account for the common usage of i&amp;oixt referring to private expense and has not adequately explained how mercenaries serving abroad can meaningfully be termed volunteers, while Pritchett's view does not account for the fact that those who campaign i6ict and are styled volunteers apparently received payment. But perhaps, in light of other considerations, another interpretation of the 6ciOidt,o( i i6icx clause is possible. Before we begin to treat the language of this document in detail, we should note that a strong concep tual dichotomy established early by 6to(7icxt iq i6iOxt continues throughout the document. The sections detailing levying of the cult-tax, recording of income received by individuals, and penalties for non 3 W K. Pritchett, The Greek State at War (GSW), vol. Ill, p. 326, following M. Launey, Recherches sur les arm?es hell? nistiques, vol.

The procedures to be followed by the strategos, as the official responsible for the fiscal, as well as strategic and tactical conduct of any campaign, stand on the 6aRgoafc side of the balance, while "those who campaign ... at private expense (i6Pxi)", "individuals", "whoever campaigns ...", and the "volunteers", belong to the other. That is, for the fiscal purposes of the decree, there is to 6a0o10ov and things performed 6atoaifa on one side, while on the other stands -o6 Xot6Ov, a smaller remainder; T6 2out6ov cannot easily bear the sense "in the future, henceforth" in this decree.10 Rather, as is common in ancient financial documents, t6 2otn6v simply indicates a smaller remainder of funds,11 in this instance those associated with private individuals (itC&amp;vrtC), volunteers (Wi)v kCo)vtCow), and whoever campaigns at private expense (oY( Kct otpc &amp;vrnl ... i6ix1). The adjective functions substantively in lines 13-14, with the adversative particle signaling the differing procedure to be followed in the case of "the rest" of the tax money,12 and the adjective functions identically in lines 23-24, which provide for the official recording of sums dispensed for military wages. In each case, this division implies a conceived total sum of tax money to be collected (11. 13-14) and wages paid out (11. 23-24). The collection and dispensation of funds under the control of the strategos apparently accounted for most of this activity, with the remainder consisting of receipts and expenses involving private funds. This somewhat basic observation should be kept in mind as the discussion proceeds. Our understanding of the terms i6icd and i&amp;dc0rr in this document constitute the basis of any expli cation. Those who prefer to see the terms as a reference to Lindians in mercenary service abroad focus on the clauses in which i6ioct functions adverbially with o[( KOC] a-pw?[1xo]vatc and mrpxtcuovrat respec tively. But as already noted, Pritchett has demonstrated, with compelling epigraphic and literary parallels, that i6iLlt most likely refers to expense, not interest.13 In many of the examples collected by Pritchett, we are clearly dealing with genuine "volunteers" who campaigned at their own expense, receiving no misthos. But it is perhaps significant that these instances regularly employ not i6ict but C9&amp;?kovTil or ?K tJOv i86iv explicitly contrasted with misthos, which makes perfectly clear that the individuals concerned campaigned "from their own" resources and did not receive misthos from another source. In any event, focusing only on lines 6-8 and 47 ignores the provision for the collection of building funds i8ict (38-40). The usage in this instance clearly lacks the semi-reflexive sense the adjective often carries, for it is difficult to imagine how the Boule could collect funds given "at its own expense". A more understandable trans lation would be "separately" or even simply "privately", more usually expressed by KXWt' i6iaV.14 The sense seems clear - the proposer envisions the collection of additional funds from private citizens under the recognizance of the Boule. Such "voluntary" individual contributions solicited by poleis officials fall under the broad rubric of subscription, a concept which has come to include a broad range of terminology and institutions - epidoseis, leitourgiai ethelontai, etc.15 - denoting private donations to the state, often 10 Cf. Accame, op. cit., pp. 215, 218. The translation "in the future" no doubt shaped the views of Launey and Pritchett (cited above, note 3) that the Lindian decree normalizes an already existing practice.

See also V Gabrielsen, The Naval</page><page sequence="6">126 M. Gonzales for military purposes. What deserves attention is how that process has been expressed in fifth-century Lindos. The Boule, as a public body, is not the logical referent of i6ica, but the private individual(s) who would do the giving, and Accame readily identified the sums so raised as epidoseis. 16 As we shall see, this peculiar usage of i6icxi makes sense in the other two contexts as well. Private donations in military contexts are well-attested throughout the ancient Greek world, with wealthy individuals defraying the military costs of the state by donating money, weapons, or ships, as well as voluntarily undertaking military liturgies like the trierachy. In some instances, citizens even recruited and/or paid for additional forces to serve their polis. Among the Athenians who served in the naval battle at Artemision, Herodotos (8.17) singled out for praise Kleinias, son of Alkibiades, who campaigned with two hundred men and his own ship, making provision from his own means. Such extraordinary private outlay by individuals seems to have been the exception in fifth-century Athens, with its abundance of imperial revenues, but became more common in the fourth century, with the polis increasingly reliant on the trierarchic liturgy to defray naval expenses.17 Even so, such compulsory service did not, apparently, dissuade rich Athenians from making additional voluntary contributions, even when already serving as trierarch. Of special note is the claim that Pasion not only fulfilled a volunteer trierarchy, but simultane ously made an epidosis of five triremes and filled them iRxp' x{toi3,18 which clearly indicates that the rowers were paid by him at his expense.19 Likewise, the Athenian metic Euxenides, who voluntarily embarked twelve sailors during the Lamian war, presumably paid for their wages.20 Would not rowers so paid be considered to campaign i6i'a 6oucivp as opposed to &amp;igoGifi? They were not being paid at public expense, or even by funds dispensed in the normal course of a liturgy, but by individuals who chose to provide additional resources to the state. In the Lindian decree at least, given the usage of i6icfi in connection with the Boule's collection of building-funds, it seems highly likely that the clause acRgoaift il iioat does not distinguish those who were officially mustered and received public payment from unpaid volunteers, but rather those who received their misthos from public funds disbursed by the strategos and those who received it from private outlay. The initial lines of the decree make clear that those who campaigned either 6c0gooiat i I6tat could be expected to receive misthos, while the provisions for recording the sums received by the strategos and that received by "whoever campaigns" (lines 21-24) explicitly states that the latter were expected to get (CTX0ov) 21 recompense for their service. Indeed, the decree's provisions for recording the sums that "whoever goes on campaign got" would be completely otiose if "whoever campaigns" were not receiving payment from some source.22 Although the qualifying iioat is not express in these lines, i'6it04)r, both here and in line 49, serves the same function, Aristocracy of Hellenistic Rhodes (Oxford 1997) 34-35, 163 notes 91 and 93, with discussion of Lindos II, no. 419 and other inscriptions. 16 Accame, op. cit., p. 222 and 228-229, who notes this as the earliest example of the practice in the Greek world. Note that Accame does not qualify such religious epidoseis as rare, pace D. Morelli, / culti in Rodi. Studi classici ed Orientali 8 (Pisa 1959) 133, note 3. 17 V.

See Gabrielsen, Funding, pp. 199-206. 19 Gabrielsen, Funding, p. 203. Although the Athenians did make naval use of slaves, identifiable in literary and epigraph ical sources by the terms hyperesia and therapontes, such evidence as exists suggests that any slaves so employed were paid, albeit at a lower rate, viz.

See Jordan, Athenian Navy, pp. 210-225. 21 The verb ea%ov cannot mean simply "had" in these lines, for that translation would assign to the Lindian epistatai a responsibility already designated in lines 15-17 as belonging to the priest, i.e. the receipt and accounting of the funds received from the generals and others. 22 As the commentary to line 14 (above) makes clear, the parsings taxcov or tax(?)cuv cannot be supported by close analysis of the inscription's orthography.</page><page sequence="7">New Observations on the Lindian Cult-Tax for Enyalios 127 standing in opposition to the strategos, who deals with monies dispensed and received 6oafiaow.23 If the decree envisions that some Lindians serving i6ica would receive misthos, these individuals would not be volunteers in the sense that Pritchett proposes, but rather individuals who chose to serve of their own accord and had their wages provided by private individuals. The prominent involvement of the Lindian epistatai, who were to record "whatever (money) the generals themselves got and the remainder (that) whoever campaigns (got)", also tends to suggest that this private outlay took place under some sort of official subscription procedure, as the epistatai appear to have been the general overseers of all public business, financial and otherwise, on Lindos.24 Financial accounts maintained by the epistatai might take several forms. Recording the amounts disbursed to strate goi from state funds would not involve an overly elaborate accounting structure, and Athenian records for various major campaigns from the 440's and 430's25 no doubt preserve a rough analogue for records of campaign expenses available to the Lindian epistatai. Accounting for the amounts paid out to "whoever campaigns" would have been somewhat more involved, however. The Hellenistic subscription lists from Kos,26 which record the private "gifts" solicited and bestowed by upon the polis during the Cretan Wars, fought under Rhodian leadership, are well known.27 Of particular note in these documents are the occa sional notations indicating that certain donations were specifically allocated for military pay.28 On the analogy of these (later) Koan lists, the Lindian epistatai of our inscription would probably not have been charged with recording the misthos of each individual soldier or sailor, an unnecessarily burdensome procedure given a probable standardized rate of pay for various types of service at Lindos and katalogoi of those enrolled for any particular campaign.29 Rather, the overseers were to record both the sum of money dispensed by the Boule to the general 68%oatit and "the rest" of money raised i6ioax and dispensed to the soldiery. Indeed, as the epistatai oversaw the election of priesthoods and other religious offices, they would seem the appropriate board to keep record of dispensations to the generals and "private" soldiers, for they could then readily produce a total upon which the Boule could base its appraisal of the priests' mandated annual accounting of cult-tax receipts. Such concerns tend to further undermine the notion that the terms i6ftxi and it9&amp;60tct refer to Lindians involved in mercenary service overseas, for how could Lindian officials learn with any certainty and record the wages or terms of service for a Lindian mercenary serving abroad?30 If we accept this line of reasoning, the participle kXwdwvv, so perplexing to previous editors, finds a somewhat more comfortable context. The Lindian usage of the Doric X&amp;iv31 roughly approximates the more familiar Attic OcE%ovTi;, which, as we have noted, can denote those who serve on campaign 23 Xenophon (Anabasis 1.3.12) draws a similar distinction between those whom Cyrus charged with military leadership (strategoi) and those individuals (idi?ta?) who chose to serve under his standard; cf. Xen. Oik. 20.6.5. 24 As attested in this inscription and later documents such as IG XII(l) 761,762, 890, etc., the epistatai of Lindos appear to have had wide-ranging oversight, including the daily business of the Boule and Assembly (see line 3 of the present inscrip tion and Accame, op. cit., p. 227), as well as the election of various religious offices and priesthoods. 2^ IG I3 363-366, recording funds dispensed to strategoi charged with operations around Samos, Corcyra, Makedonia, and elsewhere. 26 W Paton and E.

Gonzales without misthos32 and it is difficult to imagine how individuals so labeled, whether paid or not, could be understood as mercenaries in foreign service. One might presume, for the sake of argument, that citizens of Lindos serving in the Athenian fleet for pay, but of their own accord, might be styled "volunteers", even though they were "really" mercenaries. Four concerns raise fatal obstacles to such a view: 1) Allied service in the Athenian fleet cannot be considered mercenary service without unacceptably diluting the meaning of the term "mercenary";33 2) Thucydides' indication (1.31.1) that citizens of poleis allied to Athens might find employment in the fleets of either Athens or her enemies34 raises the prospect that those who served the latter would not be covered by the terms of our decree; 3) while Thucydides (1.121.3 and 1.143.1) and Xenophon (1.5.4) clearly do not recognize such service as volunteerism, bluntly ascrib ing primarily financial motives to those non-Athenians (4?Vot) enrolled in the service of Athens, such employment remained conceptually separate from mercenary service;35 4) Pay was a reward for all who served in fleets, citizen and non-citizen, conscript and "volunteer" alike.36 How, then, are we to understand the role of these "volunteers"? At its most basic, ?08X0ovtir simply refers to those who do something voluntarily, as opposed to under compulsion. In contrast, citizens who served at public expense were officially called up for duty by the polis, legally obliged to serve, and subject to public sanction if they failed to do so.37 Thus any individual citizens who chose to serve for pay even when not conscripted could, conceivably, be styled "volunteers", since they had not been called up from the official lists.38 But here we encounter an interesting temporal dichotomy in our sources, for all explicit associations of ethelontai with monetary payment come from Roman imperial authors recording the histories of Alexander and the diadochoi, and even then such paid volunteers are conceptually separate from mercenaries.39 As we have already seen, fifth and fourth century sources, by contrast, explicitly and consistently distinguish those who serve as ethelontai and those who serve for pay, and the Attic orators most often employ the adjective to denote not voluntary military service per se, but voluntary monetary contributions (epidoseis) to the state in time of military need. 40 In light of such comparanda, the participle X vtwO)vTcov in our decree seems more likely to refer to the individuals who provided the money for others to serve at private expense. 32Thuc. 1.60.1, 2.96.2; D.

It would seem, then, that oi i&amp;t Cor are those individual soldiers who were paid ii5c'i, i.e. those who served at private expense. Accordingly, if we understand o 6 &amp; Xot6Ov o TaO Xoxov-cov referentially, instead of as the direct object, the particle signals the contrast between the responsibility of the strategos, who exacts the money from the wages provided at public expense, and the obligation of soldiers whose wages were paid "from the volunteers". These soldiers are bid to turn over the money to the priest of their own accord (Ucnuoi). The somewhat emphatic UclXoi i9i1tcad41 draws attention to the responsibility of such individuals to pay the new cult tax, even though their pay had not been provided to them through the public funds disbursed to the general, but from the largesse of private individuals, i.e. OwV ?oovtwov. Indeed, a passage from Strabo strengthens this understanding of the 68aR0o6cit il' 16iot and kXoxvtv clauses, while also placing them in the appealing context of Rhodian tradition. Commenting on the Hellen istic Rhodian republic, the geographer states that the wealthy of Rhodes made it their business to supply the demos with the means of subsistence.42 Three points of Strabo's analysis deserve special attention here: 1) this practice was motivated by "a certain ancestral custom" (iEOCI rtiv RUcrpi(p) suggesting that the practice may pre-date the Hellenistic period; 2) some of this largesse took the form of liturgies which provided a salary ( t1oiupyica1 0 oviua46tVo1)43 for the poor; 3) this private expenditure focused on the republic's military needs, in particular, the maintenance of rowing manpower for the fleet (KOca gXtckta cpO; t&amp;; Vc'it0oX1c5). Such a system would be even more militarily advantageous for the smaller, pre synoikism, Rhodian poleis, allowing for larger numbers of troops than could be provided by more tradi tional volunteerism, which only wealthy individuals could afford. Strabo indicates that, in the Hellenistic period, private individuals fulfilled this ancestral practice through established liturgies filled by those of means.44 Whether the process was so regimented in the period before the foundation of the Rhodian federal state is unclear, but in any event, it seems at least plausible that Lindians participating in this ancestral Rhodian custom of private military financing are among those referenced in our inscription as o'i' KOC yxpcXtxovtcu ... i6ioi, 2 wotvGov, and i8tcxii. As a passage from Aineias Taktikos illustrates,45 some of those paid through the generosity of wealthier Lindians could, hypothetically, have been foreign merce 41 Alternatively understood as haplography for the expected amoi xoi i?icoxai as Accame, op. cit., p. 215 suggests. 42 Strabo 14.2.5 ?ripoicn?ei? ?' eioiv oi To?ioi Ka?rcep ov ?ripoKpaxoupevoi, ovv?%ziv ?' opco? ?oi)^opevoi x? xcov 7i?vfiTcov 7i^fj0o?. oiiapxeixai 8f| ? ?fjpo?

In this passage, Strabo has already noted that the demos received grain rations or subsidies (sitometrialsiteresion) at public expense. The Rhodian liturgi cal provision of opsonion therefore seems to complete the well-attested practice of providing soldiers and sailors with rations or payment for measures of grain (sitometrialsiteresion) and a "salary" for other comestibles and personal needs (opsonion).

Gonzales naries hired to serve Lindos.46 But given the testimony of Strabo on the Rhodians' "ancestral custom" of private military finance, and our interpretation of the "volunteers" of our inscription, it seems more likely that prosperous Lindians in the fifth-century defrayed the cost of their compatriots' service. We may assume that Rhodes' major 5th century cities, Kamiros, Lindos, and Jalysos, all subject to Athens until the winter of 412/1, contributed appropriate resources to Athens' various military ventures in the second and third quarters of the fifth century.47 Our decree, however, seems to fall in the more turbu lent period of League relations following upon the defeat in Egypt and subsequent restlessness among some allied states, many of whom, it is generally presumed, had ceased contributing ships to the allied fleet and so contributed money instead.48 The major Rhodian poleis regularly paid phoros to Athens until persuaded to revolt in 412/1, but the amount paid by Lindos, Kamiros, and lalysos varied over time, becoming heaviest in the period immediately preceding their ultimate revolt in 412/1.49 It may, therefore, come as a surprise to find the Lindians of this decree contemplating the prospect of public military serv ice, which would presumably mean Lindian detachments serving under Athenian leadership. Any public outlays for such campaigns might have been facilitated by the lowering of Rhodian tribute assessed for the years ca. 440-433/2. Even more surprising, in light of the much higher tribute amounts attested during and after the Archidamian war, should be the presence of two Rhodian pentekonters and 700 slingers50 in the invasion flotilla of 415. As Thucydides does not list either Rhodian contingent under the rubric of mercenaries, they would seem to be officially recognized detachments of some sort, and not simply individual rowers and marines hired by the Athenians. But why would Rhodians serve Athens when their cities were paying a historically heavy burden of annual tribute, presumably in lieu of providing ships or troops? Some of these Rhodians may have chosen to serve driven by either economic or even political consid erations. While the question of the "popularity" of the Athenian Empire remains notoriously controversial,51 the disaffection of Rhodian aristocrats is well attested.52 Indeed the Rhodian Dorieus served with the Spartans, personally commanding a detachment of the Peloponnesian fleet and presumably providing material support as well.53 But more democratically oriented Lindians, poor and otherwise, may have been willing to support Athens as the guarantor of Lindos' democratic regime, 54 perhaps even serving in or defraying the expenses of Lindian detachments participating in expeditions led by Athens. If we are correct to interpret the usages of i6ict and XbvtOV in this decree as early evidence of the Rhodians' 46 Although Ducrey, op. cit., provides instances illustrating the financial burden and political dangers of small states hiring even relatively small numbers of mercenaries. 47 ATL III, p. 242 48 See Thuc. 1.96-99 with Plut.

Meiggs, Athe nian Empire 90-91; cf. von Classen, Thukydides, vol. 6 (Berlin 1881) 78. 4^ In the initial assessment of 454/3, the Lindian aparch? of 845 drachmai corresponds to an annual tribute of almost 9 talents. When next securely attested (448/7 at 1000), the Lindian tribute has grown somewhat to around ten talents, including that of their dependents at Oiai. From 445/4 to 440/39 the city paid at a substantially lower rate (ca. 6 talents). On the eve of the war with the Peloponnesian League the amount had grown back to 10 talents and during the Archidamian War the aparch? rose substantially to an amount corresponding to an annual tribute of 15 talents. The other major cities, Kameiros and Ialysos, show comparable levels of tribute and corresponding fluctuations over time. See ATL I, pp. 290-291, 296-297, 334-335, and III, p. 349. 50 The integrity of the number transmitted in the MSS has been questioned. See Gomme, HCT, vol. 4, p. 310. 51 See de G.

II. The Shrine of Enyalios and its Topography In addition to a festival, the decree specifies that the new cult-tax is to fund the construction of an oikos for Enyalios, with provision made for the collection of private donations toward the new building. The oikos would be a small structure to shelter a cult image of the god55 that stood, in all likelihood, near his altar. The stele itself may be able to provide a few details concerning the embellishment of the shrine of Enyalios and its topography. The stone of our decree, like that of the many other Lindian inscriptions which litter the site, was hewn from the distinctive gray limestone of the Lindian acropolis and judging from the mason's treatment of the stele's sides and back, it seems likely that the sanctuary of Enyalios stood somewhere on the rocky slopes of the Lindian acropolis.56 The rear of the stele is roughly picked, indicating that it was not visible. The lateral faces of the stele exhibit anathyrosis, though the treatment of each side differs.57 While the anathyrosis of the left side runs the entire preserved length of the stele, indicating that it abutted another orthostate, the smoothed and inscribed upper portion of the right face shows it to have been only partially covered by its neighboring slab, which might suggest that the inscrip tion was displayed as part of an altar parapet or temenos wall that may have run down a slope, with each successive element founded at a slightly lower level than the last. The bottom of the stele is outfitted with a tenon, finely smoothed on the front and two lateral faces, no doubt meant for insertion into a stone socle of some sort, which tends to suggest that the area near the altar of Enyalios was paved with stone. III. The Cult and Festival of Enyalios, God of the War-Shout The funds collected by the priest are to finance a festival for Enyalios. While a comprehensive study of the worship of Enyalios is obviously beyond the scope of these focused observations, a few short remarks may help place his Lindian cult within a wider Hellenic context. Despite the epic conflation of Ares and Enyalios, the Rhodians, like most Greeks, clearly distin guished the two deities, as a Rhodian dedication from Tenos attests.58 The proof that Ares and Enyalios were originally distinct deities in the realm of cult is relatively straightforward. Ares and Enyalios had separate priesthoods of vastly different prestige-levels at Erythrai.59 The two are clearly listed separately on an Ephesian dedication of the Roman Imperial period.60 They also appear separately in the Athenian 55 The basic function of the temple is, of course, to house the cult image. See W Burkert, Greek Religion (Cambridge 1985) 88-92. Various religious structures termed oikoi, some of which contain sacred objects, are explicitly attested elsewhere, e.g. Chios (F. Sokolowski, Lois Sacr?es des Cit?s Grecques (Paris 1969) no. 118) where a familial group is responsible for taking hiera from their house to a communal sacred oikos within a t?menos. Pausanias 1.32.7 speaks of oikoi in the sacred cave of Pan near Marathon. 56 The stele's find-spot, on the Turkish coast opposite Lindos, should not dissuade us from positing its original context on or near the Lindian acropolis. See L. Robert, Pierres Errantes ..., Berytus 16 (1966) 5-39 = Opera Minora Selecta, vol. 7 (Amsterdam 1990) 637-671. 57 Left lateral (un-inscribed) face: frontal smoothed band ca. 0.04 m wide, toward the back ca. 0.025 m wide, each running the preserved length of the stele, which on this side is all but perhaps four or five inches of the intact length.

Gonzales Ephebic Oath,61 and the same may hold true in a fragmentary oath from Crete.62 In Peace, Aristophanes invokes the two deities separately, and the cults of Ares and Enyalios at Athens were originally distinct, having separate focal points and cultic associations.63 The only epigraphic sources that conflate the two deities in the realm of cult are scattered and all Roman in date.64 Even so, the Byzantine lexicographic traditions, which generally identify the two deities, were still aware of a separate genealogy for Enyalios, according to which he was of the Titanic generation.65 Thus when Pausanias mentions one sacrifice to Enyalios, one statue of the same deity, and one temple of Ares at Sparta, he is not, in all likelihood, simply resorting to variatio.66 A plotting of the cults of Ares and Enyalios on the map of the Greek world shows an unmistakable pattern that tends to reinforce the picture of two, originally separate, martial deities. Ares predominates in the north and east, while cults of Enyalios are focused almost exclusively in the south and west.67 Rhodes is no exception to this pattern and the worship of Ares per se is not attested on the island. Athens and Erythrai alone of the Ionian cities worshipped Enyalios. The historical reasons for this appar ent geographical schism remain obscure, but it cannot be easily explained by the traditional understanding of a Dorian invasion ca. 1200 B.C., for both Ares and Enyalios were already revered by the Bronze Age Greeks well before that time.68 61 SEG 16.140, lines 17-18.

The distinction continued into the realm of cult, as evidenced most clearly at Athens, where the cult of Ares was focused at Acharnai (SEG 16.140 and 21.519) by the fourth century at the latest, and was later moved to the Agora in the Augustan period - W B.

Xenophon explicitly connects Enyalios with the hoplite battle cry proper,69 as opposed to the paian, raised to Apollo as the averter of present dangers.70 We have noted above the mythological tradition surrounding Enyalios, the Aloadai, and Apollo and at Mycenaean Knossos Paian and Enyalios appear on a single tablet from an overtly military context, the Room of the Chariot Tablets. 71 In the historical period Paian was an epithet of Apollo, and is, of course, the name by which he was invoked in the homonymous cry before battle. The connection of the two deities with military affairs appears again in an inscription from the sanctu ary of Apollo Korythos in Messenia, where a certain Praxias apparently dedicated to Apollo a statue of Enyalios Thearios.72 The war-god's epithet raises particular interest, for Apollo bears the same epiklesis in an especially ancient cult at Troizen.73 Likewise, at Sparta, a statue of Enyalios stood in the Phoibaion, a sanctuary whose name recalls one of Apollo's well-known epithets, though in this case the shrine's name most properly derives from Phoibe,74 the titanness-grandmother of Apollo and Artemis.75 While the precise nature of the connection between the deities remains nebulous, the warrior's desire to avoid and/ or survive wounds while simultaneously dealing them out effectively is so basic that a very early origin for the ritual pairing of Enyalios and Paian/Apollo seems only natural. The animals to be sacrificed to Enyalios at his Lindian festival also forge connections with the worship of the god elsewhere. Boars, dogs, and goats are all explicitly attested as the victims of rituals in honor of Enyalios at both Sparta and Athens. Although KiCn]pov (11. 29-30) is restored by Accame, Pausanias' testi mony on a Spartan ephebic ritual makes it attractive. According to the Periegete, every year, the Spartan ephebes were divided into two divisions for a brutal ritual combat in the Plane Grove. Before the encoun ter, each moira of ephebes sacrificed a puppy to Enyalios in the sanctuary known as the Phoibaion and then fought a pair of trained boars. Pausanias notes that the moira whose boar won was usually victorious in the Plane Grove on the next day, which might indicate that the ephebes viewed the animal combat as a kind of divination or oracle.76 Athenian ephebes too attended the cult of Enyalios. On the 6th of Boedromion, the Athenian ephebes assembled in the sanctuary of Artemis Agrotera on the banks of the Ilissos witnessed a particularly lavish 69 Xen.

In the Iliad, Apollo releases the plague upon the Achaians (1.43-52) and Paian heals Ares' wound (5.899). 72 ?7t]oMov[i] I [K]opu0[oi] I [?v]?OeKe I 'Evua?ul[ov] Geapiov I npa^ia?. Cf.

W Burkert, Greek Religion (Cambridge 1985) 263 attributes the sanctuary to Phoibe on the strength of the rendering of the shrine in Herodotos (Ooi?fpov). See also A. Garvie, A Note on the Deity of Alcman's Parthenion, CQ 15 (1965) 185-187. The separate manuscript traditions of Pausanias and Livy (34.38.5) do not support the conjecture that Phoibaion is a corruption in the MSS for an original Phobaion, i.e. a sanctuary to Phobos, pace S. Wide, Lakonische Kulte (Leipzig 1893) 276. E. Kourinou, IT1APTH (Athens 2000) 199-205 has plausibly identified the remains of a monumental altar in the modern district of Psychiko with the site of the ancient Phoibaion. The shape of the altar in Psychiko is similar to that of Apollo's well-known sanctuary at Amyklai. Ch.

Gonzales goat-sacrifice to the goddess and Enyalios in thanks for the victory of Marathon.77 This Athenian offering to Artemis and Enyalios makes perfect sense in view of both deities close ritual ties with the various stages of a campaign and battle. Enyalios, as we have seen, was invoked to stoke the Greek warrior's martial fury in actual combat, but Artemis' involvement was arguably even more fundamental, for she oversaw and protected the transition of the army over the wild borderlands and received the sacrifice marking the tran sition into battle itself.78 The month of Enyalios' Lindian sacrifice, Artemision, would, therefore, seem to be more than a coincidence and their ritual associations here probably reflects both deities' involvement with the opening phases of combat. While there is no known parallel for the Lindian triple sacrifice of boar, dog, and kid to Enyalios, Hesychius knew an Athenian sacrifice known as the tpIKtepOC79 made to Enyalios. The term, and others closely related, appears in a variety of religious contexts, denoting a different type of sacrifice in each case,80 the only universal commonality being the number three - three animals, three-year-old sacrificial beasts, etc. Goats or pigs of various sorts are mentioned in each case as well. The Lindian sacrifice to Enyalios of a dog, a boar, and a kid may, accordingly, be interpreted as a TpIKTh?1pcX.
