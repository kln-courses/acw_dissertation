<plain_text><page sequence="1">IsMEO ACTIVITIES Centro Studi e Scavi Archeologici in Asia The archaeological excavations of the Centro Studi e Sea vi Archeologici in Asia of IsMEO, of which a brief survey is given below, were carried out thanks to the cooperation of and a grant from the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR). Archaeological Mission in Iran Isfahan, Masgid-i Gunfa. In the frame of the collaboration between IsMEO and the Service for the Restoration and Preservation of the Historical Monuments of Iran, an Italian Archaeological Mission was invited to conduct a series of re? searches in the Masgid-i Gum'a at Isfahan, work? ing together with the Italian Restoration Mission directed by the architect Eugenio Galdieri, which has already been operating there for some time (see below). The archaeological mission in the Masgid-i Gunfa, led by Prof. Umberto Scerrato of the Istituto Universitario Orientale in Naples, has up till now worked on three separate occasions; in December 1972, from 20th February to 31st March 1973, and again from 5th October to 20th December 1973. The mission was com? posed of the following persons: the archaeologists Dr Bruno Genito, Dr Maria Vittoria Fontana, Dr Ugo Bisteghi and Mr Francesco Noci, with Dr Giovanna Vassallo, finds assistant, the architect Dr Luca Mariani, assistants Mr Manlio Valen tini and Mr Gabriele Graziani, and Miss Silvia Baroni, restorer. Mr M. Hashemi of the Archae? ological Service of Tehran, the architect Mr Ro sario Paone and the restorer Mr Camillo Tarozzi of the Civil Service also gave their collaboration. The mission also had the advantage of the con? stant and valuable aid of Mr Hoseinabadi, direc? tor of the Masgid-i Gunfa restorers, whom it is our pleasure to thank most warmly and sin? cerely. The mission's project is to resume and com? plete the work already begun by Dr Galdieri, whose first exceptional results include the identi? fication of the pre-Seljuk mosque of the classic "Congregational" type and the recognition of an important Buyid phase, as well as the inde? pendent development of the dome of the sanc? tuary. These results have already been made known in these columns, as well as in the reports by E. Galdieri, published by the Centro Restauri of IsMEO, Isfahan: Masgid-i Gum'a, I, 1972 and II, 1973.' The main project of the mission, however, is to carry out a series of trial excavations whose objective is to establish the static condition of the foundations of the building, which will be estimated by the technicians, and also to com? plete our historical, archaeological, and artistic knowledge of the monument itself and of the site on which it stands (?g. 1). Exploration was begun first in the northeast? ern half of the North portico (according to Schroeder's numeration, 148-153, 157-161, 165-169, 181-185) in the northern part of the North tw?n (186). Investigation was also started in the northwestern half of the same portico (356-357, 364-365, 372-373, 380-381, 392-394, 404-405, 383). Research was then extended to a part of the so-called Muzaffarid extension (409-411, 414 415, 425, 437, 444-445, 435, 480-481). Two small trial-trenches were opened in the East portico (143-144). At the same time exploration also began in the area of the prayer hall ? in the eastern half of the sanctuary (190) and in the sections 196-197, 208-209, 220-221, 232-233, i.e. in the western half of the prayer hall, and also in the western extension of the mosque which corresponds to the present-day Sah cAbb?s I room (203, 215, 227, 239). The results of these investigations have been most encouraging, even though they give rise to a whole series of problems which will occupy us for a long time. The excavation enabled us to ascertain that all of the round pillars which are out of plumb owe their condition to the precariousness of the foundations. These are not very solid and no? where rest on virgin soil. In fact the mosque, as was to be expected, was not built on an unoccupied surface, but rests on a close web of mud-brick structures which are oriented ob? liquely, nordieast-southwest, with respect to the axis of the qibla. In every case that it was pos? sible to ascertain, the foundations rest on fallen remains or on insufficiently solid ground, and never on natural soil. This largely explains how the round pillars came to move in every direc? tion and why they are consequently so far out of plumb ? not because of possible earth move? ments, but mainly because of the poor and pre? carious state of the foundations (figs. 2-4). The close web of structures in mud brick which were revealed almost everywhere that trial excavations were carried out seem to us, as a tentative suggestion, to be attributable in part to the Sassanian period and were built upon and re-used, even quite extensively, in the Islamic period. The structures must belong to the ancient town of Yahudiyya. The presence under the sanctuary of a fairly important construction, mark 416</page><page sequence="2">.41 ? ? 1 ? 2 3 4 557*9 ??????IM tt 12 t3 . if " 15 16 17 18 30 31^ 32? III!? ?

General plan showing excavated areas (1972-73). 417</page><page sequence="3">ed by a column decorated in stucco which had already been identified by Galdieri and dated by him to the Sassanian 'period, leads us to think that the courtyard of the mosque most probably corre? sponds to a formerly-existing open space. In order to verify this hypothesis, as well as to determine the presumed subsequent expansions of the mosque, the research campaign for 1974 has as its object the cutting of a wide trench across the width of the courtyard. The excavation in the area of the sanctuary (190) has ascertained that the column of Sas? sanian type is certainly in position and that its base rests directly on the foundation plinth (fig. 5). Thus two factors of considerable interest have come to light: A) neither the base nor the founda? tion of the supposed column of the Arab network, corresponding to I 1 in Galdieris scheme, was found, but in its place there is a huge fall of unbaked bricks; B) a wall was discovered which is orientated obliquely and belongs to a fairly important building with polychrome stucco deco? rations which are comparable with the stuccoes of the Friday Mosque of N?yin and with those discovered recently in the Sir?f mosque (cf. D.B. Whitehouse in Iran, VI, 1968, pi. VIII b) (fig. 6). The floor-line of this wall is much higher than the base of the "Sassanian" column, which, hovever, could have been "utilized" in the later construction. The wall with polychrome stucco decoration was intersected at its southern end by the foundations of the Seljuq sanctuary. These factors lay open to debate the theory that the Abbasid mosque of the first third of the 10th century extended as far as the pre? sent southern boundary. This was perhaps not definitely included in the mosque until the Seljuq period. The excavation in the sanctuary area has also yielded up fragments of mud plaster with painted decoration, unfortunately in rather bad condition. The decorations consist of vegetal motifs and Kufic inscriptions painted in blue, various shades of red, black, green, and gold. These fragments, judging from the 'position in which they were found, probably belong to the pictorial decoration of the mosque before the interventions at the time of Malek Sah. We are also of the opinion that some interesting stucco fragments executed in a vigorous and sensitive style, which come from the "sanctuary" area as well, may likewise belong to the pre-Seljuq mosque (figs. 8-10). The excavation in the zone southwest of the prayer hall has enabled us to confirm that the original floor level in this area was at least 50 cm. below the present one, that is, about the same as the Seljuq level in the sanctuary (fig. 7). The restoration of this level would regain the original superb spaciousness of the mosque, and therefore ought to be taken into consideration. Finally let us mention the results of the ex? cavation in the so-called Muzaffarid extension to the North. A construction of considerable inter? est has begun to be revealed ? perhaps a small palace with central courtyard and iw?n. The decoration attributable to this building presents a combination of remarkable features which in some ways are reminiscent of Sassanian art, while other technical aspects and the choice of deco? rative motifs closely recall proto-Islamic art. Our present hypothesis is that it must be a proto Islamic monument which paves the way for the subsequent development of the Buyid architec? ture, as is known to us, for example, in the Gorgir portal. Chronologically the building is without doubt earlier than the Abbasid mosque, on the evidence of the walls of the precinct in mud brick (which up till now we have good reason to believe belong to the first third of the 10th century) since some of these walls have been incorporated in the large perimeter wall which marks the northern boundary of the mosque. Shahr-i Sokhta. The Italian Archaeological Mis? sion conducted a research campaign in Sistan in the period October-December 1973 under the leader? ship of Prof. Umberto Scerrato. In the absence of Dr Maurizio Tosi who was detained by other en? gagements in Italy, Dr Marcello Piperno was ap? pointed acting Field Director in charge of the ex? cavation at Shahr-i Sokhta, with the archaeologist Dr Raffaele Biscione and the anthropologist Prof. Edoardo Pardini, as well as Mr Sebastiano Tusa, student; Mr Gabriele Graziani, assistant; Mr Gui? do Regoli, restorer; Miss Patrizia Zolese, photo? grapher; the architect Dr Luca Mariani, topogra? pher and draughtsman. The Iranian Archaelogical Service offered, as usual, its valuable aid. In this campaign its representative was Dr Ahmid Khatib Shahidi who took an active part in the excavation and gave his efficient collaboration on every occasion. During his sojourn in Sistan with the Mission, Prof. Scerrato, together with Mr Graziani and Dr Khatib-Shahidi, conducted surveys at Qarah-i Sam, Qaleah-i Tepe and Dahan-i Ghul?m?n in order to control certain points and to programme additional research in view of the final publication of the excavations which he has carried out there in previous years. The main centre of activity in this campaign at Shahr-i Sokhta was the area of the necropolis, where the excavation of the trenches begun in the 1972 campaign was completed, that is the exten? sive excavations in the area IR and in the square 418</page><page sequence="4">IPV-IUB. In addition, two new trenches were opened in the areas HTW-HYC and IR, to the south of the square IPV-IUB and to the west of the extensive excavation respectively. The area HTW-HYC was chosen on account of a concen? tration of potsherds found on the surface as well as a slight prominence in the soil at the centre. The area IR was chosen to extend a trench which was believed sterile when begun in 1972 (fig. 12). During the 1973 campaign a total of 50 new burials was discovered. They can mostly be dated to Periods II and III (phases 7-3 of the new sequence), though there are two graves attribu? table to phase 2 (the phase of transition between Periods III and IV) and some to phases 10-9 (Period I). The graves discovered are no dif? ferent from the types already identified in the 1972 campaign. The extensive excavation and the area IR are completely homogeneous as regards both the typology of the graves and the furnishings. Shaft graves, catacomb graves, and shaft graves with a lengthwise partition wall are common to both the areas. The furnishings consist mostly of pear shaped beakers, polychrome vases, components of lapis lazuli and turquoise necklaces. A new shape, a goblet with a low foot and a wide base, was found in grave 37. In some graves, which in 1972 were thought to have been disturbed or to be without skeletons, the real burial has been revealed underneath (e.g., in grave no. 14). This burial contained the skeleton, of male sex, with the furnishings next to it. Therefore the items of grave-furnishings found in the 1972 campaign (a bronze bowl, a dagger, a pottery bowl, a small jar, a necklace) must be regarded as offerings placed on the tomb. In the area IPV-IUB, which is characterized by graves dug in gravelly soil, there is a remark? able concentration of graves, 21 in 100 sq. m. (fig. 13). The most common type is very similar to the shaft graves with a dividing wall such as were revealed in the extensive excavation. The graves were orientated in an east-west direction, with the skeletons and furnishings placed north of the wall. The earliest graves so far discovered at Shahr-i Sokhta can be attributed to this type. The furnishings generally consist of large bowls, jars with painted decorative patterns of the Na mazga III type (fig. 15), bronze disks ? probably mirrors, necklaces made of alabaster, cornelian and calcite. Lapis lazuli and turquoise are almost completely lacking. These furnishings are re? markably homogeneous. It is surprising how well organic substances are preserved in this trench, especially in the case of grave 112. This is a double burial, that of a male of the age of 45-50 and a female of about 25 years. They were wrapped in two dif? ferent sudaria, of which a good part is still pre? served. In the zone which had already been used in the more archaic phases, two more recent graves were dug which can be dated to phase 2, the transition phase between Periods III and IV. The more noteworthy of the two is grave 118 (fig. 14). This grave is bounded on the north side by a large wall running in an east-west direction and on the other sides by a thin wall in the form of a semi-circle, built of bricks placed on edge. On the inside of the north wall there is a niche, and all the other sides of the tomb and the floor were plastered with clay. At the head and feet of the skeleton, that of a man of more than 50 (one of the oldest persons buried in the graveyard) 19 vessels were arranged. These contained a great deal of organic material, includ? ing a large proportion of grape seeds. The trench which was dug in the squares HTW-HYC reveals features which can be linked with both the extensive excavation and the area IPV-IUB. In fact, in the western part the soil is sandy and gravelly with graves of the type brought to light in the area IPV-IUB; in the eastern part the soil is compact and sandy with shaft graves, catacomb graves, and shaft graves with a dividing wall. The furnishings of these tombs dug in the sand wholly resemble those found in the extensive excavation. There is however a peculiarity in grave 406: in this grave, of the shaft type with a dividing wall, the skele? ton was buried as usual on the north side of the wall but the furnishings, instead of being placed beside the body, were placed in the southern part of the grave. The principal aim of the restorations carried out in the 1973 campaign was to preserve the most interesting graves uncovered in the last two campaigns. Graves 19 and 44 were reinforced and protected by the building of structures in unbaked brick with roofs of Iranit. Grave 118, mentioned above, on account of its singular con? struction, was enclosed in a man-high structure of bricks and Iranit. The four sides of this structure have been fitted with large glass panels which allow complete visibility of the interior. The skeleton and the furnishings have been rein? forced and left in situ. One of the most promising results of the 1973 campaign is the outcome of the anthropol? ogical researches carried out by Prof. Pardini of the Florence University. The osteological ma? terial gathered has been the subject of every possible Osteometrie and morphological examina 419</page><page sequence="5">tion in order to identify the somatic characteristics of the ancient population of Shahr-i Sokhta and, by means of the analysis of the anthropological type, to inquire as far as possible into their likely origins. At the same time Prof. Pardini carried out an anthropometrical and haematological examina? tion of the people of Zabol and the surrounding villages, particularly of the three ethnic groups, the Persians, the Beluci and the Brauhi. They turned out to be quite clearly distinguishable, even from the anthropometrical viewpoint, and notably different from each other in some fea? tures. Both these examinations are clearly very im? portant, especially in view of further researches which will be determinant for the study of the genesis of the population of Shahr-i Sokhta. Archaeological Mission in Afghanistan In the period October-November 1973 the Italian Archaeological Mission visited Afghanistan to carry out a very restricted programme of activity. The Mission consisted of the Field Director, Prof. Maurizio Taddei, with Mr Nicola Labianca and Mr Elio Paparatti as draughtsman and restorer respectively. The Afghan Institute of Archaeology kindly assigned Mr Muhammad Ehsan Aram as assistant to the Mission which once again this year was able to avail itself of the help of the Works Supervisor, Mr Ghulam Naqshband, of Ghazni. The main purpose of the Mission was to check and ? where necessary ? repair and strengthen the roofing covering the various ex? cavated areas, and also carry on the work of cataloguing and restoring the Tapa Sard?r finds housed in the store-room. Nevertheless, it was possible to proceed with (though not complete) the cleaning of niche no. 76 (see EW, XXII, 1972, p. 383, fig. 14) from which were extracted some fragments of a stucco figure in the round and various heads in unbaked clay including that of the main image. These heads reveal copious traces of painting and gild? ing superimposed on each other and thus relat? ing to different periods. Study of them is very important for increasing our knowledge of the life of sculptural monuments at Tapa Sard?r and the activity of craftsmen producing them (figs. 17, 18). As regards the protection of architectural monuments excavated by the Mission in the past, the usual operations were carried out on the Palace of Sultan Mas'?d III and at Tapa Sard?r; and in addition, work on chapel no. 23 at Tapa Sard?r (see EW, XIX, 1969, p. 545, figs. 6, 7; XXII, pp. 383-84; M. Taddei, in South Asian Archaeology. Papers from the First International Conference of South Asian Archaeologists held in the University of Cambridge, London, 1973, pp. 203-13) has almost been completed by means of a screen of movable wooden planks. During the winter season this ensures that the interior is protected during bad weather and can also be seen (fig. 16). As in former years the Mission acquired a number of objets d'art, mainly Islamic. Others were given to the Mission by private citizens, and among donors we should like, gratefully, to record the names of Dr Muhammad Yakub Sul tani of the Ghazni Military Hospital, Mr Muham? mad Yunus and Mr Wali Muhammad, of Ghazni. During the Mission's period of activity at Ghazni, Prof. Taddei, together with Dr Zemariale Tarzi, Director General of Archaeology in Afghan? istan, paid a visit to the main architectural mon? uments in the Ghazni area to choose those for the restoration of which the IsMEO will be responsible, according to an agreement subse? quently signed. According to the same agreement an Archae? ological Museum will be built by the Government of the Republic of Afghanistan and IsMEO in the town of Ghazni. It will house most of the finds of the Italian Archaeological Mission and other objects from that region. Archaeological Mission in Pakistan In October-November 1973, in collaboration with the University of Trieste, the Italian Ar? chaeological Mission of IsMEO resumed work in the Aligr?ma area of the Sw?t Valley where ground soundings and excavations have been carried out ever since 1966 (see EW, XVI, 1966, p. 385; XXII, 1972, p. 384). The excavations were directed by Prof. Gior? gio Stacul with the valuable cooperation of Mr Nazir Ahmad Khan, Curator of the Sw?t Museum and representative of the Archaeological Depart? ment and of Mr Abdul Ghafur, Supervisor at the same Museum. On the hillsides which slope gently down towards the valley bottom where the Sw?t river flows, two excavation soundings were made: trench C (6X 3.50 m.) and trench D (9.50 X 3.50 m.) (figs. 19-22). The purpose of these trial trenches was to ascertain the extent of the pro tohistoric settlement that had been discovered 420</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 2 - Isfahan, Masgid-i Gum'a.

On the basis of finds visible on the surface as a result of erosion, the settlement was believed to spread over a large area (see EW, XVI, 1966, p. 385; XXII, 1972, p. 384). The digging of the two trenches some 300 m. downstream from the area where the previous ex? cavations are situated revealed a number of masonry structures dating back to different cul? tural periods, which demonstrates that the site was occupied, perhaps uninterruptedly, from about the mid-II millennium B.C. up to historical times. Of particular interest were the data obtained from trench D which was dug to a maximum depth of nearly 9 m. through different archae? ological layers and ground levels. Here masonry and materials dating back to the 2nd-1st centuries B.C. (layer @) were brought to light; these were followed by underlying structures with pottery very similar to that which was common during the middle period of the protohistoric graveyards of Sw?t (layer (3)); then further structures and finds dating back to the archaic period of the same graveyards (layers (4) - ?). In the deepest archaeological layer (layer @), at the bottom of which a large hearth was found, the remains of black-grey burnished ware and fragments of red ware with painted black bands were found. With reference to the stratigraphic sequence of Ghaligai and the succession of cultural phases in the Sw?t Valley during the protohistoric period (see EW, XIX, 1969, pp. 44-91), the potsherds and other finds from @ may be assigned to Period IV (black-grey burnished ware phase); those of 0 - ? to Period V (disk-base ware phase); those of (3) to Period VI (grey incised ware phase). Particularly well documented is the development of ceramic forms during Period V, which confirms and makes more precise data previously obtained from the graveyards of Loe banr, K?telai and Butkara II (see C. Silvi An tonini, G. Stacul, The Proto-historic Grave? yards of Sw?t (Pakistan), Rome, 1972). In addition to pottery also a number of partially preserved anthropomorphic terracotta figurines, fragments of stone maces with shaft-holes and stone querns and pestles have been gathered. The various structures are all of dry masonry consisting of irregularly shaped blocks of stone. A well similar to those unearthed during the 1972 campaign is to be assigned to the later phase, which demonstrates the long persistence of this kind of structure (storage pits?) in the settlement. Charcoal samples for radiocarbon dating were gathered in layers @ and @. Centro Restauri The Italian Mission for Restoration of IsMEO continues its activity in Iran, under the director? ship of Prof. Giuseppe Tucci, President of IsMEO and of the Centro Restauri, in the field of a fruitful and cordial collaboration between the Ira? nian Government, the Archaeological Departments of Isfahan and Shiraz, the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and IsMEO. Prof. Guglielmo De Angelis d'Ossat, Engineer and Architect, and Prof. Giuseppe Zander, Architect, work together in carrying out the Mission's projects. Dr Euge nio Galdieri, Architect, is the superintendent responsible for all the work of the Restoration Mission in this country. Persepolis The Italian Mission for Restoration at Per? sepolis, headed by Mr G. Tilia and Mrs A. B. Tilia, with the assistance of Mr Enzo Bigliazzi, Mr Aldo Di Pede and Mr Biagio Trezza, has supervised the execution of the following works in the course of the year 1973.

The south ramp was greatly damaged; the blocks of the parapet had shifted 35 cm. out of place, together with the retaining wall, and the upper surface had sunk. After the dismounting of the whole, earth and roots were removed and the blocks were reassembled in their correct position (fig. 23). The external wall has yet to be erected and the foundation under the flags of the land? ing floor must still be laid. Gate of Xerxes, east side. A part of the crowning cornice has been recomposed from frag? ments. "Unfinished" Gate. The northern part of this gate was discovered in 1971 during excavations carried out by Iranian archaeologists in order to prepare the site for the erection of platforms for a son et lumiere show. The Italian Mission has completed studies and drawings. Apad?na. In August 1973 the fifth and last drum of the north column in the East Portico, reassembled from many fragments, was raised into position (fig. 24). A capital with double Hons is being recomposed from fragments. The shaft of another column of the same portico has been almost completely reassembled. In the West Portico, from October 1973, attention has been given to the restoration of the column which is leaning 16 cm. from the vertical, thus endan? gering the capital. This capital is being completed with the fragments discovered in 1971. Similar work is being carried out in other parts of the monument. 421</page><page sequence="19">Tripylon. The paving, which was laid sub? sequently to the archaeological excavations, was composed of a fabric in which were mixed a great number of sculptural and architectural fragments. It was therefore removed and a large quantity of the fragments identified, joined, and restored to their original position or else classified, grouped, and stored (fig. 25). Hall of a Hundred Columns. In September 1973, after many years of research, it was pos? sible to reconstruct the entire shaft of a column in the Portico. The shaft is composed of four drums, and the exact height of the capital is known. The column up to the surface between the two heads of the capital is 13.12 m. in height; with the addition of the androcephalic protomae which are about 0.90 m. high, the total height reaches 14.02 m., that is to say, more than a metre higher than previously calculated. With the addition of about 2.70 m. for the architrave on the facade of the Portico and the wooden beams which rested on it to support the roof covering, the total height is calculated at about 17 metres. This information is important for the study of the parts in stone and in unbaked brick of the large pilasters at the sides of the Portico, especially for the recomposition of the blocks on the back and shoulder of the bull. Considerable strengthening and integrating operations have been carried out in the hall. The architrave of the Western Gate in the south side was dangerously broken in four pieces, one of which had remained in place on the gate-post. This architrave has been reassembled and joined by means of perforations (done in 1972), the insertion of double T-shaped iron beams, injec? tion of cement, and minor surface integrations (figs. 26, 27). The two gate-posts were dissas sembled and then replaced, in order to give greater stability and strength to the stone con? struction. It has been possible to recompose from matching fragments which have been discovered the figure of Ahura Mazda from the western gate? post. Traces of colour have also been discovered and are being documented for the purposes of a general study of the ancient polychromy of the sculptures of Persepolis. Treasury. Behind the mud-brick wall against which rests the bas-relief of Darius, a wall of baked brick, with air space and adequate pro? tective covering, has been built. After this, con? tinued the systematic task of putting back into place the stone fragments after their exact original position had been ascertained. Palace of Darius. The restoration work, which has lasted almost ten years, has been com pleted with the identification of the original posi? tion of a large number of fragments recovered in the immediate vicinity, and with further re? covery, integration and study. For example, in the biennium 1972-3, during the restoration of the staircase at the western entrance to the palace, it was possible to ascertain that a closed room existed here under the wall of the podium, and was entered by a door from the north. A drain? age system for water has also been studied. Palace of Xerxes. A good many blocks which had fallen from the terrace were raised and re? placed in their original position, after an ac? curate study of the correspondence of measure? ments and of the traces of cramps. Small jobs of strengthening and of integration were carried out here and there with the usual methods. Palace H. During the spring and summer of 1973 a more thorough investigation of previous evidence made it possible to establish the ex? istence of three superposed constructions in the south-western corner of the Terrace: the most recent in date is post-Achaemenian. The descrip? tion of the architectural elements discovered can? not be given briefly, but will be the subject of a preliminary report which will be published as soon as possible. In November 1973 the restora? tion of the parapet along the western side of the Terrace, to the west of the Palace H, was com? pleted. The parapet, whose restoration was begun several years ago, is characterized by horn-shaped elements. Naqs-i Rajab. In the latter months of 1973 the restoration of the Sasanian high-reliefs, carved in the rock some kilometres north of Persepolis, was begun. Naqs-i Rust am. The restoration of the so called Ka'ba-i Zardust was continued. The re? mains of an ancient wall in mud brick, covered with a greenish-grey plaster, were found. The wall, which dates without doubt to Achaemenian times, once surrounded the building. Taht-i Gohar. An Achaemenian palace was discovered in August 1973 as the result of a tractor running into the base of a column during work in the fields of Dast-i Gohar. In the months of October and November the general plan of the palace was ascertained by means of sound? ings and trenches. It consists of a central rectan? gular hall with at least 4x8 columns, a portico on the south-west side with 2 X 14 columns, a shorter portico towards north-west with a row of 8 columns. The area of the palace has been fenced off to protect it from damage, and a re? port of the discovery has been sent to the Author? ities in Tehran. 422</page><page sequence="20">Bag-i Fir?zi. In November 1973 another Achaemenian palace was discovered about 5 km. west of the terrace of Persepolis, near the vil? lage of Fir?zi and the Bag-i Fir?zi. There are twelve column bases with torus moulding, 82 cm. in diameter and 39 cm. in height. The surround? ing area has been fenced and the ground cleared. Not far off remains of other Achaemenian build? ings have been observed. Pasargadae. The task of searching for, iden? tifying, recomposing and fixing with adhesives various architectonic and sculptural fragments belonging to the two palaces P and S has con? tinued. It has thus been possible to replace many elements in their ancient [positions. Dor?dzan. The small bridge-dam, named Sang-i Duhtar, which years ago was removed from its original site on the east bank of the river Kor, is now being reassembled in the new place chosen, about three kilometres further down the valley of the same river, in front of the modern Darius Kabir Dam. Because of the rising level of the water, it was decided to remove the bridge in order to save this ancient monument, whose blocks are worked with a technique which, after careful examination, turned out to be simi? lar to the Achaemenian technique in use at Per? sepolis. The work, begun in November, will con? tinue in 1974. Other localities. The Italian group based at Persepolis, in friendly collaboration with their colleagues and with the Authorities of Iran, has also acted as consultant in other places where problems concerning the restoration of archaeo? logical monuments have arisen. This has been the case at Bis?p?r in the province of F?rs, at T?q-i Girrah, Kang?var, Blsutun and T?q-i Bust?n in the province of Kermansh?h. Isfahan During 1973 it was planned to continue with the form of collaboration which had already been experimented in preceding years, i.e. with the presence of the Italian experts of the Resto? ration Mission of IsMEO as technical advisors, while some members of the local staff who have been trained from 1965 have been put in charge of the various sections and are responsible for one or more monuments. The results of the preceding year, although often showing a lack of organization with the consequent imperfect collaboration of the Authorities immediately con? cerned, were on the whole satisfactory and thus recommended the continuation of the experiment in 1973. As in the past, the activity of the Restoration Mission at Isfahan has been concerned with the following eight monuments: C?H Q?p?, Cihil Sut?n, Hast Bihist, the Royal Square and Portal complex of the Qais?riya Bazaar, the Masgid-i 6umca, the Mausoleum of Pir-i Bakr?n at Ling?n and the Friday Mosque at Bersi?n. The Italian technical staff engaged at Isfahan consisted of the following persons: The architects, Dr Eugenio Galdieri, co-ordinator of the whole restoration programme, and Dr Roberto Orazi, director of restoration work. From 1973 the Mission no longer counts among its members Mr Roberto Cerbino, diploma'd restorer, who, on account of preceding engagements, has for the moment left his position as supervisor of the section in charge of painting. The two young Italians from the ranks of the Civil Service who joined the Mission in 1972 continued to take part; they are the architect, Dr Rosario Paone, in charge of documentation, and Mr Camillo Tarozzi, diploma'd restorer. In addition Mr Pao lo Castellani and Mr Piero Pieri, both diploma'd restorers, were asked to collaborate for short periods. In 1973, in accordance with the agreement between IsMEO and the Istituto Universitario Orientale in Naples, the first campaigns of the Archaeological Mission, whose scientific backing is indispensable for the delicate restoration opera? tions, took place. The Archaeological Mission was led by Prof. Umberto Scerrato, who enjoyed the collaboration of various archaeologists and scholars (see above). c?ll Q?p?. In the palace of c?li Q?p? a particularly important job was tackled in the past year, i.e. the restoration of the columned t?l?r which faces on to the Royal Square. As in the t?l?r at Cihil Sut?n, here too the wooden structures gave rise to a great deal of anxiety because of the ageing of the wood, as a result of exposure to atmospheric conditions, and also on account of wood parasites which had reduced the load-bearing section of the sustaining columns. The job of reinforcing the wooden columns by means of the insertion of a vertical iron rod proved to be a particularly complicated one on account of the remarkable slenderness of the shafts in proportion to their height and also owing to the strong inclination, especially in those of the external perimeter. (At the top they were found to be out of plumb as much as 25 cm. for a height of 10.50 m.!). At this stage of the work it is also planned to tie some of the columns together at the foot by means of iron chains stretched horizontally just under the floor level. At a further stage, that is, when the columns 423</page><page sequence="21">have been reinforced, the problems regarding the static condition and the architecture of the roof? ing will be tackled. During the year the construction of wooden gratings, similar in design to the original ones, has continued and for the most part the new frames for the openings on the south side of the top floor are now ready. Pictorial restoration went on chiefly on the top floor where the central cruciform room and the entire part south of it have been completed. In addition the restoration of the small rooms of the second mezzanine of the t?l?r level was continued while that of the lower part of the room at the same level as the t?l?r was begun and completed. Cihil Sut?n. This is the pavilion where the most progress has been made in restoration work. The greatest attention was given to the eastern part of the pavilion, i.e. in the t?l?r and the so-called Throne Room, and in the southern part where the restoration of the wooden t?l?r has been begun and that of the paintings of the vault and the whole southern wall has been completed. In the East T?l?r the reinforcement of the wooden columns (a similar operation to that described for the t?l?r of cAli Q?p?) is almost finished, while the construction of the wooden gratings, similar in design to the original ones which once adorned the Throne Room, is well under way (fig. 29). The work of repairing the floor of the Throne Room was also carried on, and at the same time the task of searching for and collecting all the fragments of wall paintings, probably belonging to the first phase of the pavilion, which came to light bit by bit in the earth underneath. There were no particular difficulties attached to the restoring of the South T?l?r, since it was a matter of repeating the operations already car? ried out in the identical North T?l?r, but the complicated nature of the work prevented its completion before the end of the year. For its part, the North T?l?r (fig. 30) is gradually assuming its finished look. The pictorial restoration is well under way, especially on the upper part of the walls, and the construction has begun of one of the wooden balconies which were present. Thanks to some traces which have remained on the walls it has been possible to reconstruct the whole structure. As regards the pictorial restoration, a great deal of progress has been made, as mentioned above, in the southern part of the Great Hall while, because of unexplainable delay in the acquisition by the local administration of suitable metal scaffolding, the restoration of the central vault in the Great Hall, which was in the pro gramme for 1973, was not able to be carried out. Finally, the most satisfactory results have been obtained in the graphic reconstruction of the system of channels surrounding the pavilion and the fountains which decorated the garden (fig. 28). This was possible thanks to the numerous traces still in situ just underneath the present ground level. These have been temporarily cov? ered up again until they can be repaired defini? tively. In view of the restoration of the whole system of channels which pass through this part of the complex, Iranian technicians who are ex? perts in this field have been approached and the preliminary plans have been drawn up for restor? ing the water-courses which, probably in the Safavid period, ran between the gardens of Hast Bihist and Cihil Sut?n and from there to the Mayd?n-i Sah. Hast Bihist. Considerable progress has also been made with this monument. Here too the graphic reconstruction of the channels and of the fountains, both inside and outside, which once adorned the pavilion is practically complete. In fact, traces have been found both of the perime trical channel and of the ponds, nearly 70 m. long, which were situated on the east and west sides of the garden. In the immediate vicinity of the pavilion work continued with the con? struction of the external stone paving and with the replacing of the original stones which had been found in situ and temporarily removed for technical reasons (fig. 31). On the north and south sides the reconstruction of the wooden cornice which once ran all around the outside wall was carried on so that, with the completion of restoration on the north, east and west walls, the pavilion is gradually resuming its original appearance. A definite contribution to this result has been made by the graphic con? struction of the gratings which adorned the walls. The whole structure of the original gratings is known, thanks to the discovery of fragments of the wood. The restoration of the painting has been continued uninterruptedly on the inside of the monument, with particular attention being given to the octagonal rooms on the entresol. Here, besides the original Safavid decorations, the sub? sequent Qajar additions and restorations have also been restored and preserved. Considerable progress has also been made on the upper floor where the chief concern was the reinforcement of the plaster which was coming away from the walls, and also of the delicate stalactite-like formations (muqarnas). Mayd?n-i Sah. In this important complex the executive role has been entrusted, as has been 424</page><page sequence="22">mentioned, to the Iranian technicians of the local Department of Archaeology from the time when 'the 'restoration project presented by IsMEO was approved in 1969. The work is continuing at a good speed, following the directions given by the experts of the Italian Mission, and has been chiefly concentrated for the moment on the re? construction of the external Bazaar, of which a large part of the west side shows good progress. On the same side the walling which, near c?li Q?p?, interrupted the continuity of the pas? sage has been taken down, with the result that for quite a long stretch the Bazaar can now be seen as it originally was. Criticism should be made, however, of certain finishing techniques which the experts of the Italian Mission have advised against more than once, such as a certain carelessness in the reconstruction of the brick wall-facing, or even the method of covering large surface areas of this facing with plaster. Neither has it been possible this year to resume work on the entrance Portal of the Qais?riya Bazaar on account of the shortage of sufficiently qualified Iranian staff. Indeed, some of the more capable staff members, after having worked for some time under the guidance of the Italian Mis? sion experts, have now been awarded scholarships to enable them to further their studies by attend? ing the courses of the Istituto Centrale del Restauro in Rome. The few remaining members, who are also waiting to be awarded scholarships, are fully taken up by the responsibilities with which they have been charged. Masgid-i Gum"a. During 1973 a considerable amount of study and restoration work has been carried on in this monument (figs. 32-35). In the North-West quadrant of the toge Sanctuary work has continued to remove the traces of oxidization and to reinforce the brickwork, the plastering, the "seals" and all other types of decoration. The job of strengthening the less solid vaults of the roofing continued, especially in the area east of the South iw?n. The k?hgel which has ac? cumulated on the vaults throughout the years is being removed, together with all "fillings" such as loose pieces of brick or earth, so that the whole bearing structure is revealed. Once this is strengthened a new protective covering will be provided, over which a finishing layer of k?hgel is applied. The study campaign was concentrated chiefly on the area of the .'roofing adjacent to the dome of the large Sanctuary and a great deal of progress has been made towards our understanding of the appearance of that part of the Mosque in the Seljuk period. As in past years, the results of this study will be published collectively in a volume which is to appear shortly. Pir-i Bakr?n at Ling?n and the Friday Mosque at Bersi?n. In 1973 the photogrammetric survey of the two monuments was begun, and the first part completed, though with not altogether satisfactory results. At the same time the Italian experts have made numerous visits to the two monuments for study purposes, in order to be able to prepare the restoration project. Cultural Missions, Italian Cultural Centres in Asia, Lectures, Schools, Publications The President of IsMEO, Prof. Giuseppe Tucci, visited Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran, where archaeological campaigns have been con? ducted under his direction. The Government of Pakistan has granted to the Italian Archaeological Mission of IsMEO the renewal for a three-year period, of the excavation licence, in force until September 30, 1976. Prof. Tucci has been in contact with the Authorities of the countries visited, as well as with the Italian diplomatic representatives. In Tehran, in agreement with the present Director of the Italian Cultural Institute, Prof. Raimon do Pizzuto, who succeeded Prof. F. Caruso on the latter's retirement in September 1973, he has established on broad outlines the programme of cultural events to be held in the course of the coming year. ?k -k -k Within the frame of the programme of cult? ural exchanges between Italy and Asian coun? tries, the following missions have taken place, entirely or partially supported by IsMEO: Prof. Gianfederico Micheletti ? Director of the Institute of Mechanical Technology of the Polytechnic of Turin ? visited Tehran in the month of April, where he held a number of lectures at the Iran College of Science and Tech? nology. He was thus able to meet the Rector, the Dean, and the professors teaching in the said College, for a fruitful exchange of ideas and sug? gestions, with the scope of establishing a lasting collaboration between it and the Polytechnic of Turin. Prof. Lionello Lanciotti ? professor of Chi? nese Language and Literature at the Faculty of Foreign Languages and Literatures at the Univer? sity of Venice ? and Prof. Luciano Petech ? professor of History of East Asia, Faculty of Letters, University of Rome ? took part in the 425</page><page sequence="23">International Congress of Orientalists in Paris in the month of July. Dr Giovanna Galluppi Vallauri has taken part in a Conference on studies on Central Asia, spon? sored by UNESCO, which was held in Paris in the month of July. Prof. Corrado Pensa ? professor of Religion and Philosophy of India and the Far East, Faculty of Letters, University of Rome ? visited the United States during the Summer, for pur? poses of research and study. During his two month stay at Berkeley, Prof. Pensa took part in an interdisciplinary seminar theoretical and practical on the techniques of meditation at the Nyingma Institute; he subsequently visited Mon? treal, where he participated in a Congress on Humanistic Psychology; he then spent ten days in New York, where he carried out bibliograph? ical researches on the same subjects. Prof. Raniero Gnoli ? professor of Indology, Faculty of Letters, University of Rome ? car? ried out a mission in Southern India, between December 1973 and January 1974. Prof. Gnoli visited various private and public libraries, in Madras, Pondicherry and Trivandrum, in search of ?gama Shivaite manuscripts, and of comments on the same. He has thus collected and set in order a vast amount of material, for future study and publication in the SOR, on the diffusion of Shivaism in Southern India. Prof. Giorgio Salvini ? professor of Gen? eral Physics, University of Rome ? has completed a cultural mission in Japan from November 4 to 18. Prof. Salvini visited there the most important Institutes and Laboratories of physics, delivering lectures and holding seminars, to pro? mote and further the cultural relations already established between Japanese and Italian research scholars in the course of missions formerly car? ried out by Profs. Amaldi, Conversi and Radieati. On November 12, a seminar was held on the problems concerning the teaching of physics at the High School and University levels, in Italy and in Japan. Prof. Salvini further made a sojourn in Bom? bay, where he visited the Tata Institute, and exchanged views with Indian physicists concern? ing the methods of research and teaching of physics in Italy and India. Members of the Italian Archaeological Mis? sions in Afghanistan and Iran attended the Second International Conference of the Association for the Promotion of South Asian Archaeology in Western Europe, held in the University of Amsterdam in July 1973 (see EW, XXII, 1972, pp. 389 f.). Reports on recent research were read by Dr Maurizio Tosi (? The Hilmand Civi? lization: Methods and Results of an Extensive Research Programme in South Asian Archae? ology ?), Dr Marcello Piperno (? Lapis Lazuli, a Functional Approach to Its Trade and Manufac? ture in the 3rd Millennium B.C. ?), Dr Raffaele Biscione (? Spiral Stratigraphy at Shahr-i Sokhta ?), Dr Grazk M. Bulgareiii {?

Prof. Giuseppe Zander ? professor of History of Architecture, Faculty of Architecture, Univer? sity of Genoa ? took part, in the month of November at Granada, in an international Con? vention on the preservation and restoration of historical gardens, dedicated in particular to Islamic gardens. The Convention was organized under the auspices of ICOMOS. * * * In Iran, under the auspices of the Italian Cultural Institute of Tehran ? to which, as for the Institute of Tokyo, is granted annual financial support by IsMEO, according to an agreement established with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs ? the following events have taken place: In March, two lectures were delivered by Prof. Angelo Filippuzzi, Superintendent of Edu? cation at Pordenone, on compulsory schooling and the school building industry in Italy. In April, a series of manifestations for aid to Venice were held in Tehran, concurrently with the establishing in Iran of a pro-Venice Committee, that has taken charge of the restora? tion of a monument in Venice, under the pat? ronage of H.I.M. Empress Farah Diba Pahlavi. On April 26, 1973, the Empress inaugurated three exhibitions: ? ? The Republic of Venice and Persia ?, a collection of documents from the State Archives of the city of Venice, and the Biblioteca Mar ciana; ? ? Venetian Prints of the 18th Century ?, comprising 288 prints, belonging to the Collec? tion of Dr Riccardo Selvatico; ?? ?New Forms in Italy ?, a display of industrial design, organized by the Mostra Trien nale of Milan.
