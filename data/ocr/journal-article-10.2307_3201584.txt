<plain_text><page sequence="1">"II Giudeo di voi": Contiguity and Conflict in Dante's Paradiso CATHERINE S. COX DANTE'S COMMEDIA HAS LONG BEEN ADMIRED FOR ITS ASTUTE AND pervasive incorporation of theological references and exegetical motifs into a richly allusive yet profoundly innovative poetic nar- rative.' An important, albeit oft ignored, component of Dante's poetic enterprise in this regard is the Commedia's representations of Jews and Judaism, particularly as they correspond to Dante's concern with interpretive subjectivity and its relationship to scrip- tural authority and truth. One such moment, the focus of my analy- sis to follow, is Beatrice's warning in Canto 5 of Paradiso, which instructs the attentive Christian to be wary of an unseen infidel's derisive laughter. As we shall see, Dante's laughing Jew, with its heuristic roots in Pauline christology, foregrounds and problematizes issues of Judeo-Christian contiguity and subjectiv- ity in context, making an important contribution to the Commedia's larger engagement with intercultural and intertextual ideological munperatives. The souls who inhabit Dante's otherworldly realms are said to comprise corpifittizi (fictive bodies), aerial manifestations of shadow and semblance, which, as impressions of their former selves, con- vey a mimetic essence and serve the christological imperatives of contrapasso and salvation upon which Beatrice's warning and its exegesis will rely.2 While Dante localizes a range of distinctions in form and function-the grotesquely dismembered bodies of In- ferno, for instance, or the luminary forms of Paradiso-the under- lying principle is consistent: the once-living body assumes, for the interim between death and Judgment, a nonmaterial but mimeti- cally corporeal form, ombra.3 Bearing the corporeal markers of somatic history-for example, Manfred's scars-and registering</page><page sequence="2">18 Catherine S. Cox physical sensations imposed by punishment, requisite to penance, or concurrent with blessedness, the corpofittizio recalls the body's former presence while signifying its interim eschatological absence: souls disguised as bodies, the spiritual as, and as not, carnal. That this fiction is articulated self-referentially by (dis)embodied souls, themselves fictive constructs, to the pilgrim Dante-who, in his capacity as audience, both is and is not similarly fictive ("Colui non par corpo fittizio" ["That one does not seem a shadowy (fic- tive) body"] [Purg 26.11-12])4--affirms the complexity and multi- valence of Dante's corporeal tropes and the dialectics of absence and presence with which they coincide.5 And, more to the imme- diate point, this motif of (non)corporeal representation is locally, and more abstractly, reconfigured in Beatrice's theological excursuses of Paradiso 4 and 5, as she sets forth her somewhat startling, and ambiguous, warning regarding Christian infidelity and its consequences both in this life and the hereafter. Beatrice prefaces her warning with a brief excursus on the alle- gorical character of corporeal representations, expounding upon an essential, and familiar, figurative dimension of scriptural ex- egesis whereby the invisible, made visible through metaphor, must be interpretively reconceived as invisible.6 "Convenit etiam sacrae Scripturae...ut spiritualia sub similitudinibus corporalium proponantur, ut saltem vel sic rudes eamrn capiant, qui ad intelligibilia secundum se capienda non sunt idonei" ("It is also befitting Holy Writ...that spiritual truths be expounded by means of figures taken from corporeal things, in order that thereby even the simple who are unable by themselves to grasp intellectual things may be able to understand it") (1.1.9), Aquinas asserts, echoing Maimonides's Guide: "Hence the description of God by attributes implying cor- poreality, in order to express His existence; because the multitude of people do not easily conceive existence unless in connection with a body, and that which is not a body nor connected with a body has for them no existence" (1.26).7 Beatrice's own attentive phrasing-"la Scrittura condescende / a vostra facultate, e piedi e mano / attribuisce a Dio e altro intende" ("Scripture condescends to your capacity, and attributes hands and feet to God, having</page><page sequence="3">South Atlantic Review 19 other meaning") (4.43-45)-both concretizes and abstracts the absent and the present in conjunction with, and in relation to, each other, and accounts for the essential reality of Dante's vi- sion: that what he sees are "di lor vero umbriferi prefazi" ["shad- owy prefaces of their truth"] (30.78-79). Taking into consider- ation the limitations of the human intellect in general and, like Aquinas, of the ignorant or simple in particular, Beatrice, in the manner of the Bible and the paradisaic signs, condescends to hu- man capacity, expounding eschatological doctrine and clarifying anthropomorphic tropes for those who might otherwise miss their inherent meaning or, from her perspective, cling ignorantly to the literal---or, in Pauline terms, carnal, and thus by extension, Old and Jewish-imagery. Should the dread of infernal damnation prove insufficient mo- tivation for Dante's, and the reader's, doctrinal understanding, Beatrice provides a more immediate and pragmatic rationale as she comments on the problem of fidelity in relation to oaths and vows: Avete il novo e '1 vecchio Testamento, e '1 pastor de la Chiesa che vi guida; questo vi basti a vostro salvamento. Se mala cupidigia altro vi grida, uomini siate, e non pecore matte, si che '1 Giudeo di voi tra voi non rida! (5.76-81) You have the New Testament and the Old, and the Shep- herd of the Church, to guide you: let this suffice for your salvation. If evil greed cry aught else to you, be you men, and not silly sheep, so that the Jew among you may not laugh at you. Foregrounding the hierarchical contiguity of Old and New, Beatrice affirms a typological hermeneutics requisite to Christian salvation, a reversed reading of the Old through the New and the New as a fulfillment of the Old (that is, the Old as always already anticipa- tory of the New through which it has always already been read).</page><page sequence="4">20 Catherine S. Cox Augustine's oft-cited dictum makes the relationship clear in its rationale to the christological reader: "Quia et Novum in Vetere est figuratum, et Vetus in Novo est revelatum" ("Because the New is figured in the Old, and the Old is revealed in the New") (Contr Adv 1.17).8 This Augustinian formulation finds contemporary ex- pression for Dante in Pope Boniface VIII's notorious address to the Roman Jews: Sanctam Legem, viti Hebraei, et laudamus et veneramur, utpote quae ab omnipotenti Deo per manus Moysi patribus vestris tradita est: observantiam vero vestram, et vanam interpretationem damnamus atque improbamus. The Holy Law, O Hebrew men, we praise and revere, since it was given to your fathers by Almighty God, by the hand of Moses. Your observance of it, however, and foolish interpretation we condemn and reject.9 Despite the contempt that both Dante and Beatrice evince for Boniface owing to political differences and perceived abuses of position,10 this Shepherd of the Church does seem to guide, or at least to anticipate, Beatrice's, and Dante's, doctrinal perspectives. For Boniface's pithy statement of christological supersession, which dismisses as foolish or vain any readings of scripture that do not support the Church's christology, acknowledges a Jewish exegeti- cal tradition while subordinating it to that of the Apostolic Faith. The "Holy Law," or Hebrew Bible, retains validity only as the "Old Testament," a subordinate and anticipatory precursor whose truth is manifest in, and contingent upon, its sequel.11 But while the co-opted scriptures of the Old Testament are given the Church's public endorsement, "il Giudeo di voi tra voi" ("the Jew among [within?] you") elicits fear and contempt.12 Si- lently lurking, his identity unrecognized, this hypothetical inter- loper haunts Christian society, awaiting the opportunity to deride the unwitting Christian whose ignorance is exposed. The furtive presence of this infidel is accepted by Beatrice as a given, without</page><page sequence="5">South Atlantic Review 21 empirical evidence and thus as a matter of faith.13 Beatrice's pre- supposition has its origins in the Augustinian doctrine of witness set forth in a popular Christmas sermon- Propter hoc enim illa gens regno suo pulsa est et dispersa per terras, ut ejus fidei cujus inimici sunt, ubique testes fieri cogerentur." On account of this the Jews were expelled from their kingdom and dispersed throughout the earth: so that they might be compelled to become witnesses in all places to the faith that they hated. -which places Jews, talion style, in the role of ineluctable ob- server, perpetually compelled to see the truth of that which they refuse to embrace. Augustine accordingly asserts, O Iudaei, ad hoc ferentes in manibus lucernam Legis, ut aliis viam demonstretis, et vobis tenebras ingeratis.1" O Jews, you carry in your hands the torch of the Law, and while you light the way for others, yet you yourself are enshrouded in darkness. (De Sym 4.4) In bearing witness to the Christian truth of the Old Testament, Augustine's Jews provide a vital service to the Christian even if they are themselves unable to benefit owing to their specifically Jewish benightedness. In addressing Jewish and Christian, Old and New, Augustine finds his metaphoric lexicon in the descriptive characterizations of the Pauline Epistles, particularly the images of carnality and blindness16 that correspond to Paul's conception of a carnal Is- rael, Israel in the flesh, that so captures his attention in the Tractatus adversus Judaeos: Videte Israel secundum carnem (1 Cor 10.18): istum autem Israel scimus esse carnalem. Sed ista isti non capiunt, et eo se ipsos carnales esse convincunt.17</page><page sequence="6">22 Catherine S. Cox Behold Israel according to the flesh: this Israel, how- ever, we know to be the carnal Israel. But the Jews do not grasp this meaning, and as a result they prove them- selves to be carnal. (7.9) Augustine articulates here a paradox of carnal insubstantiality not unlike that which Dante reconfigures as Beatrice's laughing Jew: Jews are, according to Augustine, relentlessly and indisputably car- nal, yet at the same time insubstantial in their radical alterity. As Daniel Boyarin notes in his Carnal Israel, a study of Jewish and Christian discourses of the body, Augustine knew what he was talking about. There was a difference between Jews and Christians that had to do with the body.... Augustine here argues with the fine paradox that Israel according to the flesh--i.e., the Jews--by its very insistence that it is the true Israel dem- onstrates that it does not understand that there is both a carnal and a spiritual sense to scripture, and by this demonstration, this people condemns itself to remain forever and indisputably carnal and not spiritual. (1) Blind and carnal, Augustine's Jews witness the truth of the supersessionist Christian spirit from which they have absented themselves and yet for which their presence is instrumental.'8 This underlying Pauline christology, hardly unique to Dante, provides for Dante not only a theological hermeneutics, but an exegetical poetics through which we are invited to approach the Commedia as well.1" The attentive reader of both scripture and po- etry will necessarily make subjective interpretive decisions about what words and images might mean or convey, even as the biblical text itself, Beatrice insists, like all other reflections of God's Truth, cannot itself be false, even if its literal imagery--the figuratively corporeal "piedi e mano," for instance--operates as spiritual, "veritade ascosa sotto bella menzogna" ("truth hidden under a beautiful lie") (Cony 2.1.6).20 In this regard, Beatrice's Giudeo re- calls the core metaphor of Statius's impassioned encomium to Virgil:</page><page sequence="7">South Atlantic Review 23 Facesti come quei che va di notte, che porta il lume dietro e se non giova, ma dopo se fa le persone dotte. (Purg 22.67-69) You were like one who goes by night and carries the light behind him and profits not himself, but makes those wise who follow him. Virgil's text provides readers who can see spiritually its prophetic message a religious experience so powerful, Statius claims, to ef- fect conversion: "Per te poeta fui, per te cristiano" ("Through you I was a poet, through you a Christian") (22.73-74).2I Emblematic of the spiritually motivated, non-carnal reader, Statius is saved by his christological interpretation, while Virgil, torch-bearer and porter, fails to teach himself. Dante's own position parallels Statius's, with Virgil serving as literary model and as Beatrice's chosen spiri- tual guide; Dante of course expresses great respect and gratitude for Virgil's literary achievement, even as, from a thematic point of view, Dante seems to insist, self-consciously and self-reflexively, that poetry itself is insufficient without a christological dimen- sion, a point reinforced by his assigning to Virgil's voice a crucial Augustinian ontological allusion that ushers Dante to his own spiri- tual quest: "'A te convien tenere altro viaggio,' rispuose" ("'It be- hooves you to go by another way if you would escape,' he an- swered") (1.91-92). Within the fictive parameters of the Commedia, then, Virgil assumes the christological role of "Jew," effectively bearing witness to Dante's own spiritual, as well as literary, achieve- ment. Beatrice's warning situates the derisive Jewish witness outside the Commedia's parameters, however, in proximity to Christian as- sertions of faith and ideally to be subjugated into silence. As such, it aptly conveys the Christian dread of Jewish ridicule that con- cerns Aquinas in relation to Augustinian doctrine. As John Hood notes in his discussion of Aquinas's attitudes towards Jews and Judaism, "Aquinas relies on the principle that the honor of the Christian faith must be upheld, even when there is no danger of</page><page sequence="8">24 Catherine S. Cox apostasy. Like many medieval churchmen, Thomas had a horror of Jews laughing at Christians" (97). It is this fear that Beatrice exploits: the basic human fear of humiliation exacerbated owing to the antagonistic and presumably inferior religious identity of the derisive offender. For to be men, Beatrice asserts, is to abide conscientiously and consistently by the Church's exegesis (and re- lated doctrine) of the Old and New-this alone should suffice, she insists. In likening wayward Christians to sheep and distin- guishing them from men, Beatrice sets forth implicitly the anal- ogy that since men are Christians, not-men are not-Christians and, conversely, not-Christians are not-men.22 As such, then, Beatrice sets forth the Jew and, by extension, Judaism, as marginal, subor- dinate, and inferior in contrast with the normative and dominant Christian. The Christian, Beatrice exhorts and Dante reiterates, must therefore arm himself with a commanding knowledge of scripture, since the hidden infidel's own knowledge of the Bible is perhaps that of an insider, a rival who might exhibit the exegetical means and interpretive ability to shame the ignorant Christian and who might use the Christian's own texts as a weapon against him. Beatrice's warning therefore allusively calls to mind the spec- tacle of late-thirteenth-century theological polemics. Public de- bates ostensibly performed to ascertain the truth of Christianity overJudaism (most notoriously the Paris Disputation of 1240 and the Barcelona Disputation of 1263), the disputations were con- ducted not to attract proselytes or to forestall apostasy, but to provide a public affirmation of the truth and authority of the Church and the faith;23 carefully orchestrated with rehearsed par- ticipants and scripted discussion, and confined largely to purported proofs of Christianity in the Jewish writings, the disputations rarely, though occasionally, elicited unscripted derision, but usually pro- vided a kind of intellectual entertainment for an audience already predisposed to accept in full the correct christological positions. Although Aquinas cautions that such contests pose the risk of compromising the faith of those intellectually or spiritually ill- equipped to withstand a challenge-"Quorum fides ex hoc est firmior quod nihil diversum audiorunt ab eo credunt" ("The faith</page><page sequence="9">South Atlantic Review 25 of the ignorant is firmer if they never hear anything that conflicts with what they believe") (2.2.10.7)-a knowledgeable audience predisposed to find strengths rather than weaknesses in the Chris- tian tenets could enjoy the intellectual engagement and spiritual affirmation that such mock contests afforded. Scriptural exegesis in this context becomes a discursive spectacle performed for an audience both fictive and referential, reassuring the Christian ex- egete and his like-minded audience as he pretends to defend him- self before the hypothetical derisive infidel and God. Hence Dante's own staged examinations in Cantos 24-26 on the three theological virtues: the format provides Dante with an opportunity to set forth what appear to be logical arguments for matters of belief, while the pilgrim experiences an affirmation of truth and faith in the accolades and jubilation with which his care- ful phrasings are received. Dante asserts, in the mode of Pauline tautology, that for the faithful Christian, one's belief in the truth of the gospels thus substantiates, as truth, all that the gospels con- tain.24 Similarly, Beatrice's doctrinal tour de force in Canto 7, in which she sets out to explain why "ch'a Dio e a' Giudei piacque una morte" ("God and the Jews were pleased by one same death") (7.47), aims not to persuade the nonbeliever-"e tu ascolta, che le mie parole / di gran sentenza ti faran presente" ("and do you listen, for my words will make you the gift of a great doctrine") (7.23-24)-but to bolster the faith of those who, like Dante, al- ready accept the Church's tenets and identify themselves as Chris- tian but who wish further detail regarding the faith's more ab- struse issues, such as why God chose the Incarnation as the ulti- mate remedy for original sin. And thus even if isolated moments in Dante's own text seem cryptically heretical or contradictory, they ostensibly compel the Christian reader25 to find a christological affirmation always already in place, however subtly so; it is per- haps germane to note, for instance, that Paradiso's Adam subtly and cryptically undermines the authority of Hebrew as the originary language of creation and fiat in his attempt to explain to Dante the trajectory of nomenclature associated with God: "Pria ch'i' scendessi a l'infernale ambascia, / I s'appellava in terra ii sommo</page><page sequence="10">26 Catherine S. Cox bene / onde vien la letizia che mi fascia; / e El si chiam6 poi" ("Before I descended to the anguish of Hell the Supreme Good from whom comes the joy that swathes me was named I on earth; and later He was called El") (26.133-36); while emphasizing the evolution of human language over time, Adam recalls a fictive idiom ("I") that displaces and subordinates the Hebrew ("El"),26 ironically mimicking the supersessionist tendencies of christological hermeneutics by way of an anticipatory, and self-fulfilling, rever- sal. But Beatrice's exhortation raises some challenging questions about Dante's christology and the Commedia's attitudes toward Judeo-Christian contiguity and subjectivity. If, as Sylvia Tomasch has recently argued, Dante scholars have been too eager to ignore the significance of Jewish absence and presence in the Commedia owing to their own "christianist blindness" (262), then we should identify and engage the troubling insinuations of Beatrice's laugh- ing Jew. For Beatrice's Jew and its alterity threaten to disrupt the Christian hegemony and its presumptive normativity, tensions origi- nating in the nexus of contiguous texts and divided traditions of scripture and scriptural exegesis to which Beatrice's inflammatory imagery alludes. Just as the christological spiritual supersession of the carnal is contingent upon a Pauline reconfiguring of the body/ spirit dualism ultimately validated by faith-"Non est Iudaeus, neque Graecus: non est servus, neque liber: non est masculus, neque femina" ("There is neither Jew nor gentile/Greek: there is neither slave nor free: there is neither male nor female") (Gal 3.28)27-so, too, Dante's laughingJew simultaneously insists upon a body that isn't carnal, a spirit inextricable from somatic repre- sentation, and a tautological concept of essential truth. And so too the specter of the laughing Jew conveys a threat contingent upon and substantiated by an audience's acceptance of a supersessionist authority predicated upon its antagonist's forfei- ture of scriptural authority and, with it, God's implicit approval.28 Beatrice's "Jew" therefore threatens to expose the discordant suppositions at the core of Paradiso's supersessionist doctrine. For, as Jill Robbins notes in her study of Augustine's anti-Judaic invec-</page><page sequence="11">South Atlantic Review 27 tive, "the self-understanding of Judaic exegesis would give the lie to the figural assertion that the Old Testament discredits its own authority and transfers it to the New. It would disrupt the dyadic and hierarchical oppositions such as carnal and spiritual, literal and figurative, that structure every figural claim" (11-12). If Beatrice's Jew indeed has an insider's perspective-as she implies, contrary to patristic orthodoxy-then this self-understanding of Judaic exegesis gives the lie to Paradiso's assertion of Christian supersessionist tenets;Jewish blindness and carnality would thereby be exposed as Christian constructs that signify tautologically within the parameters of the very christological interpretation that cre- ates and sustains them.29 And yet, if Beatrice's Jew is a patristic one-who actually hasn't such understanding, contrary to Beatrice's implications---then she willfully sets out to dupe the Commedia's Christian audience by inciting their fear of a phantom bogeyman, a rhetorically constituted Other who embodies their deepest anxi- eties about their own intellectual inadequacy and its public expo- sure, as well as any lingering doubts about their faith and its ex- pectations (and a decidedly uncharitable prevarication, given that it is voiced by Dante's purported conduit of Divine truth). Moreover, the ambiguous phrasing of Beatrice's warning not only complicates the theology whose authority ostensibly under- writes this rhetorically constituted witness, but also hints at an unsettling simultaneity of normative and Other. If Beatrice's Jew is hypothetically among the Christians-unrecognized and hence passing, as it were-then he poses a challenge to normative as- sumptions regarding essentialist modes of categorical identifica- tion; the Christian, she implies, cannot determine with certainty the enemy's presence owing to the latter's ability to camouflage himself by way of silence: by simply refusing to call attention to his status as Other. And her hinting that the infidel resides within poses the even greater threat of an internalized contagion, coex- istent with-and thus inextricable from-the Christian that seeks its eradication by way of subsumption, its exclusion by way of inclusion; in this regard, Beatrice's phrasing implies, the Christian is perpetually in the presence of an enemy within himself: ineluc-</page><page sequence="12">28 Catherine S. Cox table and unrecognized, perhaps, but present nonetheless.30 In at- tempting to sharpen the demarcations that underlie Christian au- thority and identity-Christian versus Jew-Beatrice instead be- trays a sense of apprehension and anxiety that effectively collapses the categorical distinctions, exposing their flawed underpinnings and revealing their very constructedness. Accordingly, Beatrice's ambiguity here contributes to the Commedia's larger engagement with issues of identity and ideology; her ambiguously determined imagery, if construed as an exegetical troping, effectively conveys in anthropomorphic terms the cultural and ideological tensions deriving from the contiguous texts and divided traditions of the Old and New, transferred or displaced onto human rivals within a society whose dominant structures and illusory subsumption sub- ordinate, but never quite eradicate, its troublesome Other. Paradiso's theology keeps bumping up against this dilemma, as Dante seems to insist upon the authority of scripture as revela- tion and fulfillment, even as he finds its appropriated applications beyond his ability to comprehend in logical, intellectual, or even ethical terms. Indeed, when Dante, apropos of the apparent dam- nation of Virgil,31 voices doubt to the celestial Eagle-"Sapete come attento io m'apparecchio / ad ascoltar; sapete qual e quello / dubbio che m'e digiun cotanto vecchio" ("You know how eager I prepare myself to listen; you know what is that question which is so old a fast to me") (19.31-33)-and reiterates the Pauline "veil" trope that seems to distance himself from accusations of carnal- ity and blindess-"che '1 vostro non l'apprende con velame" ("you here do not perceive it through a veil")'-the christological agenda of the Paradiso hints at Dante's own underlying ambivalence, his own perception of an irreconcilable and tautological fallacy, a hermeneutic circle of sorts, at the core of his larger agenda. Per- haps he merely protests too much, anticipating his readers' dis- comfiture at the unmitigated rigidity that his eschatology, and its implicit damnation of Virgil, would otherwise seem to endorse; perhaps Dante sees in the manner of scriptural contiguity and, by extension, exegesis, his own interpretive and representational di- lemmas of faith and art. In either case, it is fitting that the Eagle's</page><page sequence="13">South Atlantic Review 29 response echoes the scriptural episode of God's intimidating Job into submissive silence-"Or tu chi se', che vuo' sedere a scranna, / per giudicar di lungi mille miglia?" ("Now who are you who would sit upon the seat to judge at a thousand miles away?") (19.79- 80)32--a moment of evasion and irresolution extraordinaire. In grappling with issues of subjectivity and authority, Dante betrays an ambivalence toward his theological, if not literary, pre- decessors. Liberally appropriating the texts of classical antiquity, both pagan and Jewish, in creating his own poetry-much as the Christian exegetes appropriate the Hebrew Bible in creating a christologically motivated Old Testament-Dante must contend with the problem of how to engage in a meaningful intertextual poetics without compromising the singular accomplishment of his own art-"E quel che mi convien ritrar testeso, / non port6 voce mai, ne scrisse incostro" ("And that which I must now tell, never did voice report nor ink record") (19.7-8)-or the atten- dant substance of his theological, and overtly evangelical, agenda. "Poca favilla gran fiamma seconda" ("A great flame follows a little spark") (1.34), Dante acknowledges, but however great the flame, the underlying contingency perpetually signifies its indebtedness to the originary spark,33 a phantom presence that implicitly yet relentlessly affirms textual contiguity and contingency while de- nying, or at least questioning, the legitimacy of supersessionist tendencies as a valid means of ideological affirmation. Dante, who reads and writes as both Christian and poet, urges of his intellectually equipped and spiritually motivated readers a willingness to accept as truth the truth as it is offered.34 But if Dante the Christian is convinced of the truth hidden under his belle menzogne, Dante the poet seems decidedly less so.35 University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown NOTES 'A useful bibliographic note on the Commedia's biblical allusions and the more general issue of Dante and the Bible is provided by Kleinhenz 58-60; see also the collection edited by Barblan, esp. Artom. Dante's own, or attributed, writings offer clues to his citational purpose, albeit inconsistently so; see, for example, Convivio 2.2.2- 6 and Epistolae 10.7 (see also Padoan, and n.20, below); see also relevant entries in the</page><page sequence="14">30 Catherine S. Cox Enidclopedia Dantesca and, for an extensive search on related subjects, the Dartmouth Dante Project, coordinated by Hollander. Barolini's discussion of Dante's self-ful- filled aims is useful in this regard (esp. 1-20); see also Colish 152-220; and Franke. 2Of the many recent analyses of Dante's treatment of the body and the Commedids corporeal tropes, especially insightful are Jacoff, "Our Bodies"; Freccero, "Manfred's Wounds"; and Shapiro. Dante's corpi correspond to the paradoxical theology of resur- rection, somewhat inconsistently and idiosyncratically rendered; on resurrection the- ology and the problem of the interim body, see the excellent discussion by Bynum, esp. 291-317. As Jacoff, "Legend(s)" observes, "What are we to make of the fact that Dante both sees the blessed in their bodies and also lets us know through his exchange with St. John that they are not yet in their bodies? This constitutes, I think, a 'double truth' not dissimilar to others that we learn to hold in our minds as readers of the Paradiso" (54). 3Purgatorio's Statius explains, "cosi l'aere vicin quivi si mette / e in quella forma ch'e in lui suggella / virtualmente l'alma che ristette...e chiamata ombra" ("so here the neighboring air shapes itself in that form which is virtually imprinted on it by the soul that stopped there.., it is called a shade") (Purg 25.94-96. 101). Quotations of Dante's Commedia in this essay cite the Singleton version of the Petrocchi edition; locations are provided in the text. 4Bakhtin's observation regarding two narrative levels operating simultaneously, "one, the level of the narrator, a belief system filled with his objects, meanings, and emo- tional expressions, and the other, the level of the author, who speaks (albeit in a refracted way) by means of this story and through this story," seems apropos in this regard (314). 5 In a provocative and insightful discussion, Tambling considers Dante's corporeal imagery in terms of the Derridean trace, "used to suggest how the forgetting of writing marks Western philosophy"; Tambling observes, "The trace is something dual, for it is not unambiguously there, recording as it does absence, non-presence at the origin. Such an ambiguity, a play of presence and absence, marks out this canto from the moment the shades speak of Dante-'colui non par corpo fittizio' (26.12), as not a shadowy fictitious body, which is what they are as traces-though within the text he is indeed 'fittizio"' (410-11). See also Campbell, who notes, "The 'shadowy bodies' of the souls in the afterlife are then just exactly what they are in Dante's poem: figures of speech, metaphors" (23). 6 As articulated in the Pauline Epistle to the Hebrews, "Fide intellegimus aptata esse saecula verbo Dei ut ex invisibilibus visibilia fierent" ("By faith we understand that the world was framed by the word of God, that from invisible things visible things might be made") (13.3); translations of Latin are my own here and throughout except where otherwise noted. On Paradiso's moral topography and corresponding semiotics, see Pertile; Cogan 149-52. 7 Originally written in Arabic during the late twelfth century, Maimonides's Guide appeared in Latin translation during the early thirteenth century and circulated widely; Aquinas's indebtedness to "Rabbi Moyses," as Aquinas identifies him, is substantial; see Hood 38-61. 8 See also Simon 70-75. On the relevance of christological typology to Dante's poetics, see the landmark study by Charity; see also Singleton, "In Exitu." But, as Robbins correctly asserts, "Yet Augustine's formulation itself occults and conceals the truth claim of the Hebrew Bible that would be independent of the Gospel. It excludes</page><page sequence="15">South Atlantic Review 31 consideration of the Hebrew Bible apart from what Harold Bloom calls its 'captive' existence as the 'Old Testament.' Christian hermeneutics, in its very inclusion of the Judaic, also excludes it" (1; citing Bloom, "Original" 3). 9Text and translation in Grayzel 193-96. 10 See, for instance, Inf 19.46-54 and Par 30.128-38. " Accordingly, the label "Judeo-Christian" is in reality and practice synonymous with "Christian," and therefore a misnomer. On the significance of nomenclature related to the Hebrew Bible and the "Old Testament," see Levenson. SBeatrice here draws off of ubiquitous tropes of the Jew as not quite human; hence the associations with demons, lepers, prostitutes, and beasts so widely depicted in literature and the visual arts. On these tropes and conflations, see Rubin, "Person in the Form" and Gentile Tales; Lipton; Baron; and van Court. 13"Est autem fides sperandarum substantia rerum, argumentum non apparentium" ("Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not appar- ent") (Heb 11.1), as Dante will himself reiterate in response to St. Peter's query, ex- pounding further, "La larga ploia / de lo Spirito Santo, ch'e diffusa / in su le vecchie e 'n su le nuove cuoia" ("The plenteous rain of the Holy Spirit which is poured over the old and over the new parchments") (24.63-64, 91-92). 4" Cox, "Neither Gentile Nor Jew," discusses this sermon and its relevance to liter- ary representations of anti-Judaism; see also Jeremy Cohen 19-65. Augustine, like other patristic writers, expresses perplexity at the Jews' unwillingness to see the truth of Christianity, which is to Christians so patently obvious (hence Dante's recurring use of Pauline tropes of sight and seeing to reinforce his own Christian vision); see, for instance, Par 1.4-12 and its evocations of St. Paul's raptum as he describes it in 2 Cor 12.3ff. A useful consideration of blindness and vision in the Commedia is Warner; on the in aenigmate passage in relation to Dante's theological references and allusions, see Cook. 15 Augustine here draws off St. Paul's assertion, "Si autem tu Iudaeus cognominaris ... confidis teipsum esse ducem caecorum, lumen eorum qui in tenebris sunt... qui ergo alium doces, teipsum non doces" ("But if you are called a Jew... be confident that you are a guide of the blind, a light of them who are in darkness.. . you teach another but teach not yourself") (Rom 2.17-19). '6 As delineated in Paul's famous letter and spirit passage, whereby the letter corre- sponds to the Old Law and the spirit to the New, he likens Jewish observance to Moses's veil; see Cook, who considers the "veil" in relation to Paul's in aenigmate trope: "we may say that the New Testament is troping on the Hebrew Scriptures .... All the Hebrew Scriptures are read as if they were 'under the veil,' to repeat Paul's expres- sion.... In typological terms, the Hebrew Scriptures become the Old Testament by this reading, wherein they shadow forth what stands clear in the New Testament" (2). See also the pointed analysis of the Pauline "veil" in Boyarin, Radical Jew 86-105: "The metaphor of the veil is exact. Midrash, the way the Jews read Moses, is a hermeneutics of opacity, while Paul's allegorical/typological reading is a hermeneutics of transpar- ency. Paul can boldly go where no Jew has gone before and reveal the true telos of the text because of the spiritual condition of his listeners who, protected by the Spirit, need not fear death" (101). 7 Cf. Paul's formulation: "quoniam sapientia carnis inimica est Deo...qui autem in carne sunt, Deo placere non possunt" ("Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to God...they who are in the flesh, cannot please God") (Rom 8.7-8).</page><page sequence="16">32 Catherine S. Cox 18 "The Jew" as a rhetorically constituted imaginary construct therefore serves Beatrice's christological imperatives, in that the infidel's latent hostility provides incen- tive to the Christian to be knowledgeable and savvy with regard to scripture and scrip- tural exegesis, much as Augustine's Jew serves an ancillary function in Augustine's conception of Christian eschatology: "Codicem portatJudaeus, unde credat Christianus. Librarii nostri facti sunt, quomodo solent servi post dominos condices ferre, ut illi portando deficiant, illi legendo proficiant" ("The Jew carries the book from which the Christian takes his faith. They have become our librarians, like slaves who carry books behind their masters; the slaves gain no profit by their carrying, but their masters profit by their reading") (Enarationes 56.9). 19Much has been written on Pauline/Augustinian semiotics and the carnal/spiri- tual trope. See, for instance, Besserman 8-26; Smalley 1-26; Chenu 120ff; Vance 312- 25; Boyarin, Radical Jew 86-105; and, specifically in relation to Dante's treatments, Freccero, "Medusa"; and Gellrich 139-66. 2oAs per the contested Epistle to Can Grande, there are several layers of meaning, rooted in the literal but to be comprehended figuratively in order to locate the hidden truth: "sciendum est quod istius operis non est simplex sensus, immo dici potest polysemos, hoc est plurium sensuum" ("it should be understood that in this work there is not a single sense; it might rather be called polysemous, that is, having plural senses") (10.7). 21 For an insightful discussion of Statius's Augustinian allusion and Virgil-as-prophet, see Mazzotta 192-226, esp. 220-22; see also Picone; and Cecchetti. 22The (anti)feminist nuances of Beatrice's speech-her use of masculine pronouns and categories-are beyond the scope of this essay, but it should be noted that I reproduce her usage out of fidelity to Dante's text and not owing to any personal allegiance to its conventions. On Judaism and alterity, see Kruger; Mark Cohen; Nirenberg; Moore; Goodich. 23Ironically, the content of the debates often focused on corporeal issues, in par- ticular biblical anthropomorphism and the Christian doctrine of Incarnation; see the intriguing analysis by Abulafia. On the disputations, see Berger; Chazan; Horbury; Krauss; Maccoby; Lasker; and Dahan. 24Benfell notes, "The circularity of Dante's justification of his faith in the Bible, in other words, is another version of the hermeneutic circle" (98). See also commentary in Bosco and Reggio, especially useful for their attention to Dante's privileging of scripture over theology. 25 Botterill explains that "assent [to Christian beliefs] was the principle that gov- erned Dante's own understanding of the linguistic activities in which he was engaged, and that we overlook it at our peril" (174n4); while Dante's readership has of course extended well beyond medieval orthodox Christendom, I find it difficult to fathom how Dante's depiction of Christianity could make Christianity attractive as a religious faith to non-Christians, and I agree with Shoaf's succinct observation, "In attempting to understand the poet's theological position in his historical moment, I do not, im- plicitly or otherwise, forfeit my privilege to disagree with his theology or its conse- quences in my own life and time" ("Noon" 202). On Dante's intended audience and his influence beyond it, see Colish 219-21. 26While the Commedia, like other theologically informed late medieval literary texts, distinguishes between "Hebrew" that is, the typological precursors of Christianity, and "Jews," the stubborn infidels still present in the current world, Dante here dis- credits the Hebrew language in a way that accords, it seems, with his ambivalently anti-</page><page sequence="17">South Atlantic Review 33 Judaic perspective. This of course conflicts with his earlier stated position in De vulgari eloqutntia, in which the originary authority of Hebrew is unchallenged (1.4); see the discussion in Cervigni esp. 150-53. 27 On the hermeneutics of Paul's (pseudo)egalitarian communal unity-in which identity categories collapse and are subsumed within the normative communal ethos, unum in Christo-see Briggs. Boyarin, RadicalJew, considers the hermeneutics in rela- tion to the letter and spirit dichotomy; Cox, "Neither Gentile Nor Jew" and "Genesis and Gender," takes up the applications of performative utterances in relation to con- structed identity categories. It is fitting, I believe, that Paradiso culminates in an elusive and paradoxical affirmation and destabilization of the corpofittizio in the illusory rep- resentations of glorified bodies and hint of human effigy in the second circle, given its recurring reliance upon a radical duality throughout (for example, absolute and con- tingent will, the act and content of a vow). 28 A compelling model for this kind of discursive closed circuit, accessible only to the privileged readership for which it is intended, is St. John's gospel; Fredriksen pro- vides a pithy assessment that seems to suit Dante's own christological poetics: "If they knew, they would not need to ask; since they ask, they can never understand" (21); see also Meeks, which informs Fredriksen's discussion. While such discourses serve the closed circuit, they are of questionable utility outside it; as Hood notes, "The spectacle of some of the greatest minds in European history devoting their lives to the system- atic misinterpretation of ancient texts is truly one of the wonders of intellectual his- tory" (3). 29Religious identity and perspective are, like gender, not essentialist per se; as such, while Dante himself reads and writes as a Christian, readers of the Commedia can choose to read like a Christian, that is, according to Dante's exegetical poetics but without commitment or conversion to Dante's medieval orthodox Christianity. Butler's observation, "There is no gender identity behind the expressions of gender; that iden- tity is performatively constituted by the very 'expressions' that are said to be its re- sults" (25), seems apropos, as does Dinshaw's suggestion that "reading like a man" need not correspond to reading as a man, and that "like" signifies a "gendered re- sponse, socially constructed.... The first step toward the formulation of alternatives to a monistic reading strategy is to recognize the existence of such a strategy" (29); see also Burger on discourses of the body in relation to identity. 3 On the issue of "passing" in relation to racial, ethnic, and sexual categories, see Kruger, who notes that such identity categories operate in conjunction with, not iso- lated from, each other; see also Cox, "Neither Gentile Nor Jew," on the problem for Christian society of Jews passing for gentiles; and Tomasch on cultural attitudes to- ward hidden Jewishness. 31The Virgil problem has been the subject of numerous analyses, some advocating his salvation, others refuting it on the grounds of Dante's christology; an insightful contribution to the debate, advocating salavation, is provided by Iliescu. Given the Eagle's cryptic hints of chosenness and Christian hypocrisy-"Ma vedi: molti gridan 'Cristo, Cristo!' / che saranno in giudicio assai men prope / a lui, che tal che non conosce Cristo" ("But behold, many cry Christ, Christ, who, at the Judgment, shall be far less near to Him than he who knows not Christ") (19.106-08), an echo of St. Matthew's Jesus asserting, "Non omnis qui dicit mihi, Domine, Domine, intrabit in regnum caelorum" ("Not everyone who says "Lord, Lord" will enter the kingdom of heaven") (7.21)-it is not unreasonable to interpret the possibility within Dante's idio- syncratic and fictive system, however much based upon orthodox eschatology.</page><page sequence="18">34 Catherine S. Cox 32This is the gist of chapters 28 and 39 of Job, in which God, his theophany mediated by the tempest, silences Job's challenging questions and compels Job to re- cant his desire to learn; St. Paul reiterates the line of questioning in Rom 9.19-23. 33 Dante here suggests an "anxiety of influence," as it were, attempting to come to terms with his predecessors and his relationship to them; on the general psychoana- lytic concept in relation to literary criticism, see Bloom, Anxiey, for an excellent recent consideration of Bloom's theory and medieval poetics, see Shoaf, Chaucer's Body. 34See Paradiso 2.10-15; cf. Inferno 9.61-63. Critics of the Commedia are often in sync with Dante's theology; Hawkins, for example, asserts, "It is impossible for me to disregard the religious core of the poem or discount what I take to be the poet's genuinely evangelical impulses" (10). But see also Tomasch's compelling argument, which notes that "The invitation to join him in his stellarward movement is very powerful indeed," hence the tendency of critics to favor a "conversional poetics to which they themselves can aspire" (262-63). 3 An earlier version of this essay was presented at the Modern Language Associa- tion (MLA) annual meeting, in Washington, DC, on 27 December 2000.
