<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOWARDS A GENERATIVE VIEW OF THE ORAL FORMULA MICHAEL N. NAGLER Uniiversity of California The last few years have seen a dramatic and gratifying upsurge of interest in the Homeric formula.I This new interest has gradually come to focus on the real nature of the formula as a mentat template in the mind of the oral poet, rather than on statistical aspects of " repetition" found among phrases in the text.

NAGLER [I967 heart of the problem, but it is proving to be so difficult and subtle that it has divided theoreticians of the oral formula into a number of non-too-friendly camps and seems to have brought most aspects of the study of oral poetry in general to an impasse.2 One group, recently called "soft Parryists"3 and represented by Hainsworth, Russo, and others, has been demonstrating more and more kinds of resemblance among phrases or parts of phrases in the text and interpreting these resemblances as additional criteria for " formulaicness." Others, while presumably not contesting the statistical significance or general interest of the resemblances in question, refuse to broaden their criteria for formulaic resemblance beyond those implied by the famous but no longer standard definition of the formula by Milman Parry: " a group of words which is regularly employed under the same metrical conditions to express a given essential idea" (Studies I 80; and cf. Hainsworth, Structure and Content i55). The issue is not merely semantic: when does the echoing of one phrase by another indicate that the poet has employed a formula common to both, which most critics even today still regard as a kind of detraction from his "origi- nality," and when is such resemblance to be explained on some other grounds, e.g. coincidence? Or, to look at the evidence of the texts from a centrifugal rather than centripetal viewpoint, in an array of phrases which are progressively different from one another in various ways, which is a formula, which a "modification" of the formula, and which no formula at all? Our uncertainty as to when we can reasonably decide that a formula has been used rests on a prior uncer- tainty as to the nature of the formula as a mental entity: we cannot be sure how or when the thing behaves, to say nothing of its poetic value, until we have a much better idea what it is. Neither "hard" nor "soft" Parryism will, in my opinion, bring 2 Kirk, for example, writes recently that "little has been achieved since Parry died" (SH 68), while McLeod, in his superb review of Hoekstra's Homeric Modifications, cites that work as "the first book in nearly forty years on the Homeric formula," and concludes that, "despite the ground won by Hoekstra's efforts, we still do not know enough about the development of formulas " (in Phoenix 20 [I966] 333 and 339). Recent differences of opinion between Kirk and Van der Valk, though of great interest, sound in part like the age-old "Homeric Question" slightly sophisticated by knowledge of the oral formula (Van der Valk, AC 35 [I966] 5-70). 3 Cf. T. G. Rosenmeyer, "The Formula in Early Greek Poetry," Arion 4 (I965) 297.</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 98] A GENERATIVE VIEW 27I us much closer to an answer to this central question.4 Those who admit of any kind of resemblance between phrases-resemblance of meter, syntax, diction, or the like-as being formulaic can point to the fact that Parry himself had suggested that his criteria were provisional and would need to be expanded (e.g. at Studies I I26), but they are then faced with the problem ofjust how far to expand them, in other words, of inventing a reason for drawing the line at a given point. If one goes as far as Russo, for example, in saying that metrical-grammatical V Nz N patterns such as 1- or v for single words are "in themselves formulaic" (p. 240) irrespective of their dictional content, the suggestion is likely to be considered hopelessly broad; what, exactly, is the relation- ship of this " formulaicness " to the word-for-word inevitability of the noun-epithet combination or the imposing rigidity and thrift of the schematized "formula systems" which we, somewhat unfairly, con- sider the salient features of Parry's work? And similar problems arise with the question of diction: for example with Ruijgh's contention that the occurrence of a lexical item such as vv is formulaic in certain metrical positions, as well as with other criteria.5 Those, on the other hand, who have cleaved to the hard definition ofthe formula and its operations cannot account for these newly discovered kinds of correspondence in any way other than to deny, explicitly or by implication, that the Homer of our texts was "merely" an oral poet.6 4 One can make a further distinction among "soft" Parryists, between those who view the received formula as having one form which "our" poet could vary (Hains- worth) and those who view the formula itself as a (fixed) pattern of some sort which the poet fills in (Russo); theview to be developedherewould resemble that of the latter group, but only superficially. The former, along with the "hard" Parryists (Pope, Minton), tend to oversimplify Parry's own view as "a rigid and pervasive schematization of the diction" (Hainsworth, Homeric Formula 64); cf. Hoekstra I3. 5L'Ele'ment Acheen dans la langue epique (Assen 1957) 57-67, cf. Russo 243; Kirk, SH 67; Hoekstra I5. The problem has become the more acute in the metrical area with the rewarding studies in word-localization and colometry that have been under- taken since Parry's time. Russo's error of logic in failing to distinguish between oral and written hexameter poetry does not vitiate the importance of his work for theories of the formula; cf. his more recent statement in YCS 20 (I966) 223, note I3.

NAGLER [I967 This lack of unanimity about such fundamental matters as the formula and formulaic repetition is particularly unfortunate at the present time for several reasons. It is not unlikely, for one thing, that the use of electronic computers will soon be adding a good deal to the amount of statistical evidence already compiled on formulas or suspected formulas in Greek hexameter poetry.7 As Prof McLeod has ably shown (above, note 2), this effort may only compound our difficulties if no solid conceptual framework can be constructed for the evaluation of such data. For another thing, "formulas," by various criteria, have now been discovered not only in Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, Delphic oracular utterances, and the fragments of Panyassis, but in such widely disparate areas of literature as Old and Middle English, Medieval French epic, Old Testament verse, Babylonian and Hittite epic, Toda ritual songs, Coorg dance songs, Spanish and English ballads, and still others.8 It is my impression that in many if not all of these areas the progress of oral formulaic studies has by now run aground on the same problem-the investigators cannot agree as to what is formulaic about their formulas; once they attempt to go beyond statistical observation of the verbatim repetition of phrases or lines in a given 7 Cf.

The far-reaching connotations of these terms for the aesthetic appreciation of any oral poetry, not only on the level of the formulaic phrase but also on that of the motif, type-scene, and whole plot, are apparent; and this is another reason why the theory of the formula must be thoroughly re-examined. It is very doubtful whether we are justified in discriminating between " traditional" and "original "-to say nothing of making value judgments based on such discriminations-until we have a clearer idea just what these terms may imply in an oral context. Furthermore, it is an unfortunate fact that, despite many suggestions and some preliminary attempts, no coherent aesthetic theory has as yet emerged which would equip us to understand or appreciate the special nature of oral poetry as poetry. Unlike Parry himself, some students of the formula have tended to regard it as a "phrase type" or "metrical type," without complicating the issue with meaningful- ness or aesthetic value-a simplification which, as I shall try to show, throws the baby out with the bath water. On the other hand, literary critics of the poems have understandably not been able to assimilate the concept of formulaic diction, as presented in an incomplete form by Parry, into their theories of poetry. This perplexity was implicit in the following dictum of Meister, whose concept of Homer's "art language" influenced Parry greatly: "Der homerische Kunstdialekt dichtet fur seinen Dichter." IO What kind of art is imnlied bv closed 9 For the appearance of formulas in literary texts and the vexed question of the " trans- itional text" as a common problem, cf.

NAGLER [I967 and invariable systems of phrases, fixed and meaningless epithets, inapposite similes, and dead metaphors? What is needed is a theory of the formula which accounts for the irrefutable statistical facts that distinguish the texts of Homer from those of poets known to have composed by writing, yet does not close the door on the free play of creativity and genius that is so obvious throughout the Iliad and the Odyssey to every unprejudiced reader of the poems. We may go one step further: a sound theory of the formula, consonant with the research on oral creativity carried out by modern anthropologists, should better enable us to understand the beauty and meaning of the poems than any theory designed to explain written epics. For whatever one's views of the recension and trans- mission of the text, it is obvious on statistical grounds alone that Homeric poetry was fundamentally oral poetry. This study will put forward in outline a theory of oral composition answering to the above criteria. Among other things it is hoped that this theory may facilitate some reconciliation of the rather divergent schools of thought that have arisen on this subject since Parry's time. I We may begin by re-investigating the type of corresponsion which Parry called calembour, as seen, for example, in the following pair of phrases: dlto-Av0Ev -Uso aJv-rqi (Od. I2.369) dltoqAv06E 6rAvs acv-r4 (Od. 6. I I2), about which he remarks: "d4uo4AvOEv, employe pour decrire l'odeur du sacrifice se repandant dans l'air, convient aussi bien a decrire un son qui semble remplir l'air."" II ET 9I; there is no implication of humorous or other word-play, or even suggestion that one phrase in any way echoes the other, although Parry does imply that there might be some chronological priority of one or the other. See below, pp. 286-88, and, for chronology of the v-movable, McLeod's review of Hoekstra (above, note 2) 337-38. These are the only two usages of cqLE,pEOpXo,LaL in Homer (Hesiod uses 7rEpLEpXo,uaL in this sense), so it is difficult to know the "semantic scatter" of the word in the archaic period (for the inscriptional evidence cf. LSJ9).

But sometimes phrases in non-oral poetry sound alike in this way, for example the intriguing "corresponsions," etc. cited in earlier commentaries on Pindar.I2 Are any of the factors here, as Parry assumed, indicative offormulaic similarity, and if so, which ones? Let us take a more extensive group of phrases, part of which could be considered a formula-system by Parry's definition.I3 This group involves-among other things-an interplay of &amp;XHioS and 8&amp;yo'&amp; in the dative case combined with the adjective 7rriwv to realize that portion of the hexameter falling after the bucolic diaeresis, which Porter would call the C I form of the final colon and which we shall refer to for descriptive purposes as the adonean clausula.I4 These combinations give end-line phrases such as 7TlOVl 8uC "(hidden in) rich fat" (Od. I7.24I) and rn'ovt 8&amp;jup "(amid the) flourishing populace" (9 times). Whatever difference the pitch accent may have made in actual pro- nunciation during an epic performance, few scholars would deny that the overwhelming similarity of rhythm and phonetic sound among these phrases is "formulaic." Yet is is obvious that they do not express one "given essential idea." One may wish to rescue this part of Parry's definition by considering them two sets of formulas in the same system rather than ten examples of the same formula (and the 12 " Corresponsion " was the term used by Mezger and Bury, " tautometric recurrence " or "echo" by Famell. Professor Bundy brings the following examples to my attention from different epinikia: Pythian 2.6-8, 3.30, I.84, 4.200. Cf. 0o EIT acpoadKTd (II. 2.3 I2); in different position,7Oo t &amp;ET' aKporacrv (II. 4.484); with different syntax, aypov EIT EaXarL7)v (Od. 4.5I7); and II. 20.328, Od. I2.I5, 9.382, I9.389, I5.552, H. 7.38, 45 (further examples inEdwards, I28), alongside Sappho, fragment io5 (Page). The whole problem of formulaicness in non-oral poetry and its relation to the same in oral verse cannot be treated here, but it is raised most pointedly by Russo. I3 "A group of phrases which have the same metrical value and which are enough alike in thought and word to leave no doubt that the poet who used them knew them not only as a single formula, but also as formulas of a certain type" (Studies I 85). The subjective element of this definition is to be contrasted with the impression of rigidity made by the visual impact of the actual schemata chosen; cf. ET I9, Formules 22, 50 for other definitions. I4I mean to imply nothing here about the ethical value of the terms "adonean," or even "clausula" (Porter [above, note 5] I3); note that the phrases are sometimes preceded by enclitic E'vt' or Ev, sometimes by metrically and semanticaly "heavier words" (Frankel [above, note 5]), so that the adonean portion as such can be more or less detachable from the rest of the verse.</page><page sequence="8">276 MICHAEL N. NAGLER [I967 doubt is itself instructive), but no very positive purpose would be served by such a maneuver. It has already been adequately demon- strated by a number of writers that the criterion of the "same es- sential idea" does not always apply to those phrases, even those noun-epithet combinations, which are sufficiently similar to be regarded as allomorphs of a single template, whatever we may choose to call it.I 5 Whereas the phrases cited thus far are true noun-epithet combinations, there are other examples in the 6rjpos group where the adjective 7Tl()V is not in the dative but in the accusative (singular or plural), modifying some noun which occurs earlier in the verse. In these cases the final 6-(O also fulfills an entirely different syntactic function than it does in Od. I7.24I: V/LL Em7Tl /fl7pta K7E, KaAvbaS rdovt &amp;8p4 (Od.

I6 Note punctuation before the adonean section in the second, but not in the remain- ing, examples. This question is similar to those raised by Parry's famous article on "The Distinctive Character of Enjambment in Homeric Verse," TAPA 6o (I929) 200-20. The overall rhetorical structure of oral-formulaic verses in general is a subject calling for much study, to which Kirk (YCS 20.76-I52) and Edwards have provided an excellent beginning.</page><page sequence="9">Vol. 98] A GENERATIVE VIEW 277 group is almost always preceded by Ev (or E v).'7 -lETo certainly sounds enough like mr-ovt for the resemblance to be called formulaic on subjective grounds, but the former is a different part of speech and stands again in a different syntactic relationship to the final word of the verse than the adjective. iTdovt 8&amp;pkco and r7'lE7o &amp;j/up, therefore, confront us with a strong resemblance not accounted for by even the "soft-Parryan" concept of the structural formula. Only the very broadest and, one would think, most fundamental criterion for formulaicness remains-that of the metrical pattern itself, that is, the recurrence of metrical cola in the same position and with the same internal distribution of word-end (cf. Russo 239). But there are phrases connected in some way with the present group whose resemblances to it pass the boundaries set by even this criterion, in much the same way that ideational boundaries are over- reached by foiv ... .Tlova 6r)yu. We can show this by arranging the following end-line phrases as a series, with 7Tdovt 8&amp;j,Ucip as arbitrary starting point and progressively greater variation in phonemic and then in various metrical features: I. ovt &amp;rp (9 times) 2.

I do not think the traditional (Alexandrian) sevenfold division of the parts of speech can have been the functional one in Homeric language; cf. J. A. Russo, "The Structural Formula in Homeric Verse," YCS 20 (I966) 230 and note 25 (though he does not try to extend the point from "local influence" to formulas in general), and Edwards I28. Simpler divisions have evidently now been devised by linguists and might well be adapted for formula studies.</page><page sequence="10">278 MICHAEL N. NAGLER [I967 word-end of the pattern is one step more recessive, although E'v is like rE in being a semantically " light," or functional, word (see above, note I7). We now take a crucial step to example 7, where the phrase itself has outgrown the adonean clausula by two morae, and with our final examples we are carried clear back to the midline caesura-or rather first to within one mora and finally to the caesura itself: x 'TPe TotoLOV vtOs 0 &amp; a'AAoiT Evt S r7/up (II. 19.324) toy,EV 7g SO8vorE?v a'AAoyvdno e'vit &amp;4'L (Od. 2.366) +k51a KacTaKrTELVas cLAAWv ECKETO 87LOV (Ii. 24.48I) If any additional caesura is to be sought between the midline and the end of the verse on a basis of word-end in these first two lines, it would have to be placed after position 9 (note the absence of correption), which would separate the group E'v j3u from the preceding adjective. This was not yet clearly so with the "transitional" examples 4-7 (note elision in 5 and 6). On the other hand, there are almost uncanny phonemic "corresponsions" between the adonean segments of each of these last three verses and one of the first three phrases:I8 f '7Jlovt &amp;mp f TIETO 7NL@ { lKETO 5S7(OV -'7TCZ EVL 5 7Jp -TW EVm 8l- -CE ETO S?[ZOV This fact raises as a rather startling possibility the notion that formulas, whatever they are, may not necessarily be made up of word-groups at all. More generally, considerations other than our present concept of word-end may contribute to feelings of subdivision within the epic hexameter. At the least, these corresponsions should suggest the operation of psychological cola or rhythmical groups of some sort, having hitherto undetermined relation to formulas, and based upon factors which are not always statistically quantifiable, indeed, not always readily apparent to modern readers of the text. Whatever may be the larger implications of these observations for metrical theory, it is clear that objective metrical criteria as we now know them will not provide an indispensable diferentia for each I8This kind of corresponsion involving vowel-and-consonant patterns is in fact present to some degree among all of these examples, as it is in the S-6uo's group: ayE__ 87/UCs, S&amp;7rAaKt 8-qtut4 (II.

However, one is justified in feeling that the resemblances among the phrases in these two groups is something more than merest coincidence, in other words that they are groups of something; and that if some of the resemblances do follow criteria which have actually been put forward for formulaicness while others do not, this fact may be an accident of our present method.2o Can we justify this subjective feeling of coherence in any other way ?

Provisionally, the word "formula," since it means different things to different people, might well be avoided and an entirely new concept employed in its stead. It seems to me that one is available and already in use in certain other disciplines, and that it promises to suit the facts better than that which has been the basis of study until now. With the conceptual framework in question, a group such as the ITtOVt 8&amp;mpuc (87qjuWi) phrases would be considered not a closed "system" but an open-ended "family," and each phrase in the group would be considered an allomorph, not of any other existing phrase, but of some central Gestalt-for want of a better term-which is the real mental template underlying the production of all such phrases. The Gestalt itself, in our case, would seem to exist on a preverbal level of the poet's mind, since we have found it impossible to define other than as a comprehensive list of all the allomorphs which happen to exist in the recorded corpus. But to approach accuracy this would have to be made an infinitely open-ended list, leaving room for all the allomorphs that escaped recording (the vast majority!) and even all possible allomorphs; it would not really be a definition at all. The imprecision of this notion can hardly be welcome in an area where imprecision has already caused such a troublesome diversity of opinions; but I suggest that it is inevitable if one wishes to come closer to the actual operations of the mind in its creation of oral epic verses, a process which Parry and Lord recognized to be the production of a language like any other.21 An analogous imprecision-that is to say, unwillingness to impose unwarranted precision on phenomena-has by now come to character- ize nearly every comparable field of inquiry. An absence of objective, classificatory definitions and the technique of description by family rather than class resemblances are keystones of the linguistic philosophy of Wittgenstein, for example. He uses this metaphor to describe the concept: And the result of this examination [of activities included under the label 21 Studies II 12; ST 22, 36, etc.; see below, note 27.</page><page sequence="14">282 MICHAEL N. NAGLER [I967 game"] is: we see a complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of detail. 67. I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than "family resemblances"; for the various resemblances between members of a family: build, features, colour of eyes, gait, temperament, etc. etc. overlap and criss-cross in the same way.. .. And I shall say: games' form a family. And for instance the kinds of number form a family in the same way.... And we extend our concept of number as in spinning a thread we twist fibre on fibre. And the strength of the thread does not reside in the fact that some one fibre runs through its whole length, but in the overlapping of many fibres.22 Here the individual fibres of the thread sound exactly like our various objective criteria for formulaic resemblance, which seldom seem to stretch from one end to the other of a series like 7lOVt 8D@- ... 4AA)v Ef 'KETO c377LOV or TEvXE KVVESclV ... OCKEV 'Tatlp ... &amp;OKE bOp7J vat ... aAyE' 6'OTKEV (Russo, with additions). From a generative, as opposed to a merely descriptive, point of view these "fibres" are the several parameters which, by themselves or in various combinations, can make a preconscious Gestalt present to the mind of the singer and enable him to realize that Gestalt in the form (metrical, lexical, etc.) appropriate for the moment of utterance. In linguistics proper, the notion of an underlying "deep structure" from which a potentially unlimited series of "surface structures" (i.e. spoken sentences) can be realized has long held the field, and in fact is now being modified in the direction of less rigid classification of the surface structures and less rigid definitions of the base structures (we refer primarily to the brilliant work of Noam Chomsky).23 And in a field which is perhaps more germane to the study of Homer as an oral poet, despite some lingering prejudices against oral "song" 22 Philosophical Investigations, tr.

Levi-Strauss himself has referred to the " singularity of myth among other linguistic phenomena. Myth is the part of language where the formula tra- duttore, traditore reaches its lowest truth value" (" Structural Study of Myth," ?2.5). Unlike a preverbal Gestalt, the structural model of a myth or folktale can in fact be deduced from a given array of allo- morphs by simply eliminating as ornamentation those features which are not invariably present in each allomorph, and then deducing the basic similarities underlying the variations of what remains. Thus, as Levi-Strauss explains, whether Kadmos kills a dragon or Oedipus the sphinx, a pattern clearly emerges which can with some certainty be stated as "denial of the autochthonous origin of man" (op. cit. ? 4.5, 4.8). No such clearly expressible pattern emerges from the welter of rhythmic, phonemic, ideational, and other parameters of even limited groups of phrases such as those we are now considering. Other folklorists, however, have encountered this difficulty and have not shrunk from the idea of abandoning ironclad definitions of basic 24 Lord and his co-workers have already applied structuralist concepts of linguistics and anthropology to studies of the theme and to overall notions of oral tradition; the novelty of the present argument consists only in applying them specifically on the level of the phrase.

NAGLER [I967 structures on levels where such definitions seem inappropriate or are simply not attainable. B. H. Bronson, after exhaustive compilation of certain ballad tunes and their "variants," expressed this situation with particular clarity in I954: It is moreover to be kept in mind that the folk-memory does not recall by a note-for-note accuracy, as a solo performer memorizes a Beethoven sonata. Rather, it preserves a melodic idea in a state of fluid suspension, as it were, and precipitates that idea into a fresh condensation with each rendition, even with each new stanza sung. There is no correct form of the tune from which to depart, or to sustain, but only an infinite series of positive realizations of the melodic idea.26 All of these precedents from other areas of inquiry do not prove that a preverbal Gestalt generating a family of allomorphs must be the best conceptual framework for the Homeric formula, but they do show that it is at least a possibility that the prevailing concept of the fixed and determinable structure, be it superficial (the completed phrase) or relatively deep (e.g. the localization of a metrical sequence), is not a priori the only working model for the production of phrases in oral epic composition. Before examining further the concept of the preverbal Gestalt, which in the author's experience has already proved more useful than the prevailing view, let us be perfectly clear about the significant ways in which this concept differs from the latter. First of all, it is an ahistorical view in many areas where hitherto the major emphasis of research has been on diachronic change and even on the establishment of relative and absolute chronologies to mark that change. In some respects this will make but little difference, for example with the three stages in the making of an oral poet as described by Lord (ST, Chap. 2). In our view, as in his, the aspiring bard is not to be thought of as memorizing phrases which he hears from older singers, gradually stockpiling large numbers of such phrases in his memory, and then merelv linkino them tooether to form whole verses (cf. Notopoulos. 26 "The Morphology of Ballad Tunes," JAF 67 (I954) 5-6 (italics added). It is appropriate that Eric Havelock (Preface to Plato [Cambridge, Mass., I963] 147) has cited the improvisatory methods of jazz as a parallel to Greek oral composition, as Robert Stevick (above, note 8) has for Anglo-Saxon; lest the analogy be discounted on the grounds of artistic quality, as that of the South-Slavic songs often is, we may suggest as well the classical music of India.</page><page sequence="17">Vol. 981 A GENERATIVE VIEW 285 [above, note 8] 5o). But more than this, he is not even memorizing "prototypes" which for dialectal or other reasons he must sometimes "modify" for his own use before linking them together in this way. 12 It is not a question of hearing mdovt 8 4t, committing the phrase to 12 memory, and then simply uttering mdov 8&amp;m,Upt wherever it fits the ." N 212 economy" of his "systems"; nor of deducing I - - from such phrases as 7Lrovt &amp;4 tcp, apyE'Tt 8mqHuw, etc. and then "inventing" or "substituting" to produce, say, rnTovt vqcw; it is not a simple question of phrases at all. Rather, in a more complicated and subtle, because more intuitive, way, the poet takes in many hundreds of lines contain- 12 12 ing units such as mlOvt 8Sp, GOE 8' US Tt7ETO 8&amp;', aAAo8a,n EVt 12 5 3Wc, -t t ev JAAo8a&amp;ci,etc.,from all of which he develops an intui- tive "feel" for a fluid Gestalt which he retains in his unconscious mind, probably in the same unknown way that the phrasal impulses of any language are retained in the mind when not in use. He then tries to realize that Gestalt at appropriate times and in appropriate ways- i.e. into the appropriate forms of its various parameters-in his fledg- ling attempts at verse-making (Lord's second stage), further securing the patterns in his mind by actually practising them.27 Eventually (the third stage) he is ready for interaction with a highly critical and highly appreciative audience. What he learns is a method rather than its products; his own usage of the traditional Gestalt will be somewhat different from that of his teachers as it will be from that of his own contemporaries (ST 63-64), but the Gestalt itself he cannot profitably be said to adapt or change, for a very simple reason: the Gestalt itself is undifferentiated into any of its possible parameters. There is no 27 For some of these parameters the appropriate form in any given realization may be the "zero grade" (see below, p. 303), i.e. they may not appear. The crucial importance of practice is explained by Lord: "It may truthfully be said that the singer imitates the techniques of composition of his master or masters rather than particular songs" (ST 24). "[The singer of tales] does not 'memorize' formulas, any more than we as children ' memorize' language. He learns them by hearing them in other singers' songs, and by habitual usage they become part of his singing as well. Memorization is a conscious act of making one's own, and repeating, something that one regards as fixed and not one's own. The learning of an oral poetic language follows the same principles as the leaming of language itself, not by the conscious schematization of elementary grammars but by the natural oral method" (ST 36).</page><page sequence="18">286 MICHAEL N. NAGLER [I967 need for him to make change in, say, the phonetic configuration of a certain phrase, since that configuration is not determined until the moment of utterance. For this reason also, Lord and others are correct in saying that his usage of traditional patterns is no more mechanical than the speaking of a natural language (e.g. ST 35-36). Thus far the preverbal concept, despite its ahistoric orientation, can be easily accommodated to current views of the formula. In other respects, however, this orientation will make for a markedly different approach, most obviously perhaps with the question of "early and late" in Homeric language.28 A generative view should make it somewhat easier to understand the occurrence of earlier and later forms side by side in the Homeric texts without recourse to multiple authorship, or to the rather vague and inconsistent attempts to create a special place for Homer outside of his own tradition, which are the most recent forms of that ancient heresy.29 To take perhaps the best- known chronological sequence of forms, we would not say that pre- Homeric bards of the Dark Ages had memorized a formula-prototype including Mycenaean genitive singular in -ojo (&lt;-osyo) and then changed this prototype so that it now ended in -oo, which later bards in turn (or later scribes) contracted to -c or -ov.30 Rather, all these singers acquired the "feel" of a general impulse, included among the parameters of which was a preverbal notion of the second declension genitive singular masculine; the particular reflex of the notion, -oto, -00, or -ov, which the singer produced on any given occasion must have depended primarily on its metrical position in the verse (Chan- traine [above, note 30] i65, I94, Meister [above, note IO] passim), 28 The following remarks are intended merely as illustration; space forbids attempting to establish this point in detail. Questions of orthography (-ov for uncontracted -oo) and textual corruption will be left aside. 29 Even scholars fundamentally sympathetic to the idea that Homer was an oral poet have not always been able to avoid recourse to qualifications of the latter kind; cf. Kirk, SH 97 et passim; Bowra, Tradition and Designi in the Iliad (Oxford 1930) 66; C. H. Whit- man, Homer and the Heroic Tradition (Cambridge 1958) 13. Having no Indo-European oral poetry prior to Homer, and none subsequently of quite comparable quality, we may never be able to decide this question with any assurance. My own prejudice is to align myself with Parry and Lord in regarding Homer as a typical oral bard in every- thing but his genius; but in any case the generative approach, which facilitates this view, may be considered on its own merits. 30PRuijgh (above, note 5) I14-I5, 126, 140; Hoekstra 132; Chantraine, Granmnaire Hoineriqtte I (Paris 1942) 44-45.</page><page sequence="19">Vol. 98] A GENERATIVE VIEW 287 combined with other factors such as his dialect, the "horizontal" or "local influence" of neighboring usages, and of course various aesthetic considerations, some of which are beyond our understanding if not beyond our ken. Retention of the linguistically oldest form I2 in the phrase 7TToA4toLo tyEq pas (4 times)-to take a particularly recalcitrant example3I-is not so much due to the fact that the whole phrase was fixed and passed on as such in the minds of singers from generation to generation, as to the fact that no other form of the word I2 was metrically possible in the final position-cf. ToA4Lpov aKOp7j-wT I2 ( .335), and similarly ava ToA I 2 07MTIEVEL 7TOAE1LOLO )EpVpas (k'. 4.37I). The point is not that earlier forms were not being constantly reused in oral tradition after they had dropped from ordinary speech, nor that Homer did not tend to use certain of these archaic (or archaizing) allomorphs in a somewhat less fluid way than he did their linguistic- ally contemporary reflexes-there is some evidence that this is so 2 but the point is that these differences are relatively superficial; on a more fundamental level, early and late forms (and, for that matter, various dialectal forms) were used in quite the same way by the poet of our texts. As long as the tradition flourished, the creative process was always a question of realizing particular, appropriate allomorphs of the same general ideas that the poet's predecessors had employed in 3' Page, History and the Homeric Iliad (Berkeley 1959) 243. The repeated use of iioA4- /olto in theBatrachomyomachia, on the otherhand, probablyis more of a conscious archaism, whereby the word is being artifically retained and not spontaneously recreated (cf. lines I23, I34, and 20I for this metrical position). 32 The cases assembled by Ruijgh (above, note S) with regard to aviracp/ardp are the most impressive, but the statistical samples become dangerously small in much of his subsequent discussion. Similarly, to Hoekstra's sparse examples (38-4I) of "depar- tures from the traditional course" which show the metathesis assumed to be linguistic- ally contemporary with Homer, we must add II. 7.94, which does not: o0e 8E 87) MevEAaos avd6raro KaL ,J_4e-ee7re; and cf.

P. Shipp, Studies in the Language of Homer (Cambridge I953). For the use of late linguistic forms in passages of early content, cf. Webster, From Mycenae to Homer (London I964) 46 and Hoekstra I6, note i. All of this is not to say that our text must be quite free of inter- polations, only that chronological differences in forms need not in themselves be evi- dence of multiple authorship.</page><page sequence="20">288 MICHAEL N. NAGLER [I967 comparable situations; if forms from other eras or other dialects provided additional avenues of expression for these ideas, he was likely to use them, exercising the same instinctive control over them as a poetic artist that he did over any other realizations.33 A genera- tive view is thus consistent with the features of the epic dialect as the product of an oral tradition. Furthermore, it obviates the necessity of creating a special category for the poet of our texts on linguistic grounds. If Homer was-as I believe-a real cot&amp;o's-, he never "departed" from his tradition. The exact form of the epic singing tradition at any point prior to Homer we shall never know, but if it was like any comparable one in human history it must have been a continuous stream from its beginnings somewhere in the Mycenaean era (?) to its end sometime after the composition of the Homeric poems. Homeric reflexes of it are the appropriate ones for their time and those performances, and what we may be glimpsing of it in the cyclic fragments, the hymns, Hesiodea, and fragments of Panyassis are the forms appropriate to their times, their individual poets, their genres. Thus the view being put forward is synchronic with regard to the text of Homer, which is seen-aside from the difficult questions of corruption in the written recensions-as an instant in the continuous flux of a living tradition. Therefore, a series of phrases like those compiled above, e.g. from 'iovt 8X &amp;t through WAAo3armt5 E V 4u, is not put forward as an historical series: no attempt need be made to guess which of these phrases is the "original form of the formula," for the simple reason that no actual examiple is taken to be the origin of any other, not even in the analogical sense often implied by Parry.34 The generative aspect of our position is totally different from "hard Parryism" in looking vertically to a deep structure underlying the production of two similar or identical phrases rather than horizontally 33 See below. The aesthetic irrelevancy of early and late language has been very well brought out by Dodds in Platnauer (ed.), Fifty Years of Classical Scholarship (Oxford I954) 22: "The present writer was inclined to regard the different linguistic ingredients as so many colors on the palette of the artist; the history of the pigments, it might be argued, has little relevance for the critic concerned with the design and composition of the picture." 34 ET, etc. As far as chronological priority is concerned, it must be noted that, whereas Parry considered that there was some definite sequence for the formulas in an analogical system, he was not foolhardy enough to establish it.</page><page sequence="21">Vol. 98] A GENERATIVE VIEW 289 from one phrase to the second. Moreover, it is only apparently similar to contemporary "soft Parryism," for it holds the deep structures in- volved to be not yet differentiated enough to be verbally definable. N " V iz2 The fact that concrete patterns like _ V - - can be deduced from large numbers of existing end-line phrases is considered merely a statistical phenomenon. Yet, a flexible and generative viewpoint is not necessarily a non- Parryan one. Parry himself stated that a fully detailed, concrete description of Homer's formulaic technique would be unthinkably complex (Studies I I26) and that "that moment which criticism must seek to create [is] the instant when the thought of the poet expressed itself in song." 35 Wherever this view may fit among ever-burgeoning controversies about formulaic style, its application to the subject has immediate repercussions in the questions of unity and originality. For one thing, noun-epithet combinations need no longer be set apart from other expressions simply because they do not vary as much from one another as do the latter. This may now be considered a secondary matter, having to do with their most frequent poetic functions as bearers of generic rather than particular meaning, and their most frequent syntactic-metrical functions as musical counterpoint to expressions bearing the main ideas of the narration. Nor is there any inevitability about this, as we see from 'dova 8-quo'v, idov&amp; 8rqcu versus gorv... -iLova 8rnqli, and Am7capoOKp 7&amp;pvos- versus Acrapa' Kpj8,Ewuva. Noun- epithet combinations, like other expressions, are produced anew from some unfinished source each time they are used. Similarly, within any set of identical noun-epithet combinations, complex phrases, whole lines, or even whole passages, absence of variation from one another need by no means imply a fixity in the tradition which hampered the poet's creative urges, or, for that matter, made his creativity unnecessary. The real "variation" is in the process which transmutes pre-verbal Gestalt into utterable phrase, line, or scene, and compared to this process the resemblances among given allomorphs are, again, quite secondary. 35 From the unfinished "Cor Huso: A Study in Southslavic Heroic Song," quoted by Lord in Serbocroatian Heroic Songs i (Cambridge I954) 5.</page><page sequence="22">290 MICHAEL N. NAGLER [I967 If this much be granted as a provisional framework, an old ghost which has been exorcised time and again but continues to pervade our thinking about oral composition, particularly on the level of the phrase, may be laid to rest at last. I refer to the formulation, "tradi- tional versus original," which in statistical discussions can take the form, " norm (i.e. frequent) versus variant (i.e. infrequent)." 36 Perhaps the most unfortunate forms of this dichotomy are those it assumes in the area of criticism. For it seems to follow inevitably from the con- cept of tradition held by most literary critics (many of whom would surely disavow this view if it were proposed explicitly) that "tradi- tional" implies "faded," while "original" implies "artful, meaning- ful," in oral poetry as well as in written. Thus, in this view, only those original efforts which can be seen to break away from the traditional background can be the loci of the great creative power in the poems,37 despite Parry's observation that "the fame of a [good] singer comes not from quitting the tradition but from putting it to the best use" (Studies II I4; cf. above, note 29). It is a telling fact that the same dichotomy can equally well result in the opposite evaluation, namely that only pure, traditional bards could have created the great poetry in our texts, and that original contribu- tions are the products of rhapsodes or other interpolators who were attempting to imitate their oral predecessors, with little 36 This troublesome idea is as pervasive in the area of metrics as in that of the formula proper; the use of quotation marks in the following statement of O'Neill's ([above, iiote 5 ] I I6) shows how uncomfortable he himself felt with the value-judgments which he nonetheless felt constrained to impose on his statistical evidence: " to what extent does each poet localize his word-types; i.e., how many of his longer words are in the 'right' and how many are in the 'wrong' positions ? " 37 The following examples are chosen almost at random: Charles Marrot, "Les Origines du poete Homere," REH 4 (I934) 32; Tilman Krischer, "Die Entschuldigung des Sangers (Ilias B 484-93)," RhM io8 (I965) 9-IO; Russo 242. Cf also Kirk, SH74, I67 et passim; Whitman (above, note 29) I2; but cf also I4-I5 et passim. The emer- gence of this view in Edwards' " General Conclusions" (I75-79) seems to me to follow more this long-standing habit of thought than his own brilliantly developed arguments. It is particularly regrettable that he adds some rather striking conclusions on the differences between Homer and oral poets on the same basis (cf. above, note 29). For examples of the same thinking with regard to Old and Middle English poetry, cf. A. G. Brodeur, The Art of Beowuif (Berkeley 1959) 70, and R. A.

In reality, lines beginning co ob1Aot, avEpESo E'UTE and those beginning avEpES EGrTE, ht'Aot are allomorphs of the same idea, appropriate to different syntactic situations, much as E'7TEa lrrEpoEvTa formulas, as Parry demonstrated,39 are syntactic allomorphs on a par with other loquitur phrases. Once we view Homer as a traditional oral poet, producing his own poetic reflexes of his tradition along the lines indicated above, then within the text of one performance, or even a series of them, no distinction between traditional and original need be drawn, and this plaguey critical dilemma ceases to exist. The terms "traditional" and "original" do have legitimate appli- cations in a theory of oral poetry, but not as conflicting polar opposites. Rather, they describe two stages of the same creative process, Gestalt and realization. Since the former is always traditional, furthermore, and the latter by definition always original, these terms merely desig- nate the natural condition of those two stages in true oral composition; they are not in the least controversial and need not enter into any discussion of artistic quality. A modern linguist would no doubt put it this way: "All is traditional on the generative level, all original on the level of performance."40 38 Both evaluations have been expressed in rather prejudicial, value-loaded vocabulary in recent years. Thus, one writer " assumes " that all things traditional are " faded " and " ossified remains," while others refer to "variations," i.e. departures from the tradition, as "contaminated, degenerate, decomposed," even "perverted." In my view, as stated above, until some degree of unanimity has been reached on a theory of the formula, it will be hazardous even to decide what is traditional and what original, to say nothing of making value-judgments based upon such decisions. 39 Cf. G. M. Calhoun, "The Art of Formula in Homer: Epea Pteroenta," CP 30 (I935) 215-27, and Parry, "About Winged Words," CP 32 (I937) 59-63. The phrase avEpEs Ea-re, XLAot serves as opening for the second line of an invocation of which the first begins with 2 +vocative; the phrase c' XAot (and hence that line-rhythm) cannot be repeated for reasons of style. 40 As Professor Chomsky has said (verbally) in this connection, "Every sentence I utter is original; " cf. above, note 23, and Cartesian Linmuistics (New York io66) -1 I - IO*</page><page sequence="24">292 MICHAEL N. NAGLER [I967 II Although the main emphasis of the present study falls upon the theory of the oral formula as a word or word-group, we must attempt to enter into the extremely difficult and sometimes desperately subjective questions of denotative and poetic meanings of the traditional Gestalt and its realizations. The necessity to do so arises from the above-mentioned fact that in the area of aesthetics it is particularly true that "little has been achieved since Parry died" (cf. above, note 2). It is no great exaggeration to say that, just as there has been no generally accepted theory of the formula since then, perhaps because of this there has been no successful aesthetic criticism of Homer as an oral poet. We are loath to sacrifice the objectivity of Parry's formula-systems or the structural formulas of later scholars, for they are among the most scientific achievements of Homeric philology, but we are understandably incapable of imagin- ing how poetry of any quality, to say nothing of the Iliad and the Odyssey, could have been created "by the numbers" in systems of such apparent fixity. In the absence of a positive answer to this question, most evaluations of the oral formulaic style still proceed from the vantage point of written literature, so that they have in- evitably tended to be negative, or at best apologetic.4' But a beginning of a concrete analysis of oral style on its own grounds was made by Parry in his preliminary study of the kinds of meaning expressed by phrases in poetic diction,42 and it is this lead that we shall attempt to follow in extending and supporting the theoretical viewpoints put forward above. It has become obvious, even to those who view oral-traditional language as a repertoire of "stock formulas," that this view offers no 4I Thus it is understandable that Combellack finds the greatness of the oral style "paradoxical" ("Some Formulary Illogicalities in Homer," TAPA 96 [I965] 41-56). Cf. Lattimore's introduction to his translation of the Iliad (Chicago I961) 40: "He did not inake this style, he used it. It needs no defense. Padded, adjectival, leisurely, routine, it works." Whitman provides exceptions to the above, e.g. (above, note 29) 14-15: " The poet's task is, and always has been, to transform the serviceable into the symbolic, and for this purpose Homer's medium is no more restrictive than any other. In fact it has distinct advantages." 42 "The Homeric Gloss: A Study in Word-Sense," TAPA 59 (1928) 233. The third level of meaning, which he called "sense" and I shall be calling "(poetic) signification," is not far from what he initended by the "essential idea" of epithets (see below).</page><page sequence="25">Vol. 98] A GENERATIVE VIEW 293 automatic solution to the problem of poetic meaningfulness or its absence in Homeric diction, not even if one arbitrarily limits the scope of his inquiry to true noun-epithet combinations.43 And the problem becomes increasingly complex with longer or more variable syntactic structures. Consider the verse a'AA' orE rO(uoOV a&amp;iTv 3ucrvov rTE YEyCOVE fo0Iuas (3 times), one of a group of more or less similar expressions used as poetic ways of saying "but when ... a certain distance off," when a person is approaching or leaving someone or some place at various points in the narrative.44 Sometimes the allomorph in question has no other special denotations or connotations as far as we can tell: e.g. at Od. 6.294 when Odysseus is directed to Alcinous' private temenos (ro'ruuov adro7 Tro'Atosg oYOV TE yEyWvE g fortas), and we could para- phrase "a longish distance" rather than "within earshot," for all the line has to do with actual shouting. A few books later, when Odysseus is rowing away from the Cyclops' island, he stops just still within earshot-JaAA' JTE TO'(J(JOV dbnTv O'(J(JOV TE yEOJYVE flo4oasg (Od. 9.473) -in order to shout his identity to his former captor; but even here the literal meaning of the last phrase could not have intruded very forcibly into the poet's consciousness, for he says only a few lines later, when the ship has been jolted further seaward (Od. 9.49I-92): aAA' O'TE 87 &amp;S Tooroov aAa iTpfYUororovTEs arL7T7Ev KaL TOT EY( AvKAVAWTca '2TpoUor)VOV. On the other hand, the same expression is used when Odysseus is floundering in the sea within earshot of the Phaeacian coast (Od. 5.400-I): aAA' OTE Toorov alrI7v oaaov TE yEyovE /o3oUags Kat - &amp;7OVTOV aLKOVrE ITOTL UrLA a a oror aAJursr. Here there is an explicit connection with hearing, in that he has come close enough to hear the surf pounding on the dry land, and there may also be an underlying suggestion, unconscious perhaps, that he is close 43E.g. Whallon (above, note i5), Hoekstra I3, Edwards ii8. See above, p. 276. 44 As a kind of Zeitangabe (cf. W. Arend, Die typischen Szenen bei Homer [Berlin 1933] Table 5) the line functions as a transitional device between portions of narrative, but in addition to this function the verbs at the end of the line may be pregnant with some idea of human contact (see below). Bowra (above, note 29) 88, recognizes the "sign- post" function of certain whole lines without looking for any such implicit ideas and with a merely negative evaluation that they "relieve the mind of some effort."</page><page sequence="26">294 MICHAEL N. NAGLER [I967 in enough to shout for help if it came to that. In the final example in the Odyssey, the explicit meaning of the phrase is not only conscious but definitely pregnant with poetic signification, for it occurs as Odysseus and his men are drawing near the island of the Sirens (Od. I2.I8I-83): aAA' OTE Toorov a'-1T-LEv oorov TE yEywVE /3o-qoas PC/4a 8WUKOVTES, TagS 8 ov' AaOEV dUiKvcaAos g vVis EyyVOEv 3pvvLJdv7), Atyvjpnv o' EvTvvov ao0t8v. In the face of this flexibility, who could still claim that "the" formula regularly does or does not have a single, intrinsic meaning? (Nor should such an oversimplification be conveniently laid in Parry's lap, as advocates of both sides have tried to do.)45 But a tentative explanation may be suggested rather naturally along the lines of the generative rather than separatist theoretical framework we have been developing here: some kinds of meaning, including at least literal denotation ("be heard") and poetic suggestion (" contact") may be latent in the traditional Gestalt and may be left latent or allowed to shine forth in various shades and connotations with each particular realization. Let us make a precautionary observation before testing this theory in the more extensive dTovt 53q'[Lq or Kp773E/ILVOV groups: whether or not a possible shade of meaning emerges with a given realization cannot be a simple question of diction. Od. 5.400 (= 9.473) and I2.I8I differ only in the conjugation aJ7rrjv!a'7rrVEv (and the interesting metrical realizations of ua(a)ov), while 6.294, -rC ruov c7T n 7TT-Atos &amp;raov TE 7EyCOVE ,8o4uas, has an entirely different initial half-line; yet this last could be grouped with the first two and opposed to I2.I8I in terms of the poetic meaningfulness of the phrase in its context. Clearly, above and beyond the diction of an individual allomorph, the relation of a phrase to the narrative situation can play a role in its overall mean- ing. A striking case of the effect of the context can be seen in the utterance of the following lines at II. 2.453-54 and II.I3-I4: roZort S' a'qap 7T0'AE,L05 yAVKlCV yeVET' 77E vEEoraL Ev v-qvor yAawvp-at bA'qv es 7raTpC`pa ya?av. 45 Cf. Whallon (above, note i5); Hainsworth, Homeric Formula 64, Hoekstra 13; with Studies I I26. The unfinished state of Parry's work leaves a somewhat ambiguous impression in the key areas of fixity of idea and expression.</page><page sequence="27">Vol. 98] A GENERATIVE VIEW 295 The first occurrence is very poignant, coming as it does after the ex- hortations of Odysseus and Nestor have barely rescued the expedition when it was all but embarked for the voyage home; the second is simply a straightforward response to one of a series of martial exhorta- tions. Another case, to enlist a noun-epithet combination, is the following line, famous alike for its onomatopoetry and the metaphor of the final phrase (Od. II.598): aVrts EITElTa 7TE`OV&amp;E KVAVSErO Aaasa aJvacls.. This phrase also occurs, however, in a usage which may be regarded as less specialized and one in which the anthropomorphic power of the figure is certainly far less salient (II. 4.52I-22) :46 acFoLrEPw &amp;E rEVOVTE KaU OUTELa Aa&amp;a avat&amp;qg axpts arr)qolratEV .... On the other hand, some evidence seems to suggest that poetic signification can go hand in hand with diction in a curious way, by- passing denotative meaning. Various forms of yEywva occur five times in the Odyssey and eleven times in the Iliad unconnected with any TOaaOV ... oJuov correlation to express the idea, "to make oneself heard" in various narrative situations.47 Only once is the verb of shouting a participial form of floa'c (cf.0d. 8.305), and it is only in this line that a notion of difficult or urgent contact similar to that in some of 46 Cf. Aaav aEdpas-, 3 times. Further examples in Hoekstra I3. For discussion of the onomatopoetry of the line in the Sisyphus story, cf. Stanford, The Sound of Greek (Berkeley I967) 107-8, and Kirk, YCS 20.96-97. It is remarkable that in the Iliad example, where there can be no question of onomatopoetic mimesis, we have exactly the same rhythm and remarkably similar phonemes-it is questionable whether a person not knowing Greek, upon hearing the two lines, would consider the first one "bouncier." We can only conclude that the "bounce" in the sound of the line-type as used in military situations most commonly (one must not assume "traditionally," "normally," or the like-note its appearance also when Polyphemus is stoning Odys- seus' ship, Od. 9.537) was a parameter which Homer knew could either be realized effectively in conjunction with the sense or left latent without such support. It is gratifying to find that Edwards (I3 8-48) has presented much the same picture with regard to other metrical effects, such as positional stress. It is not a very large step from this view to that of the presence or absence of meaning put forward below. Meter is to poetry what inflection is to spoken language-a set of signals for the conveyance or stress of potential meanings resident in words. 47 But cf. the disjunctive expression in II. 8.223-27 and ii.6-io.</page><page sequence="28">296 MICHAEL N. NAGLER [I967 the above-mentioned passages seems to be stressed:48 Menestheus is trying to alert the Ajaxes to the oncoming attack of Sarpedon and Glau- cus. Moreover, the word roororov occurs in the line following this one, albeit without the correlative sense it has in the group discussed above (Ii. I2.337-38): a'AA' OV' ov Ot E?71 pwcxtvro a EyWyVElV' / \ / ^ )1 3.. % c) I 8 f TOauOros 'yap KTV'7OS 7EV, aVT-1 ovpavov LKE. This concurrence of participial g3o4w, ,ycycova, and 'orc6ov may appear to be mere coincidence, even against the background of the 7-o'uJov... ota(cov expressions in the Odyssey, but it is also possible that the Gestalt of that group has played a part in the production of the lines from Iliad I2, and it may even be proper to say that that Gestalt is in fact realized in these lines without its accounting for all of the diction that is finally produced. If so, then the "agglomeration" of these dictional signals is not merely a gratuitous reflex, as Ruijgh uses the term ([above, note 5] 2I)-interesting as that may be as an insight into the free-associational process of oral composition. It is also another indication that poetic meaningfulness inheres in the preverbal Gestalt, and further that its realization does not depend upon the simultaneous realization of all other parameters, suclh as literal meaning, syntax, rhythm, etc.49 Inspection of the meanings involved in the more extensive groups we have been considering may help to clarify these conclusions. The most elaborate example of 7dtovt /S- diction is to be found in the Theogoniy, in connection, naturally enough, with Hesiod's account of 48 yEywova by itself does not necessarily imply calling. Fisk (s.v.) connects the verb with ytyvWG)KWO, probably rightly; aside from Odysseus' fateful address to the Cyclops, it can be translated "make known" in at least the following passages from the Odyssey: 8.305, I2.370, I7.I6I. Strikingly parallel to the passage at hand is R. I7.246-53, where the contact is difficult for visual reasons. Note -ro'ua (253) and the use of a common noun-epithet combina- tion with obviously apposite significance: /0o)v a&amp;ya6os MEvEAaos5 (246). 49 All this does indicate that a significant aspect of Homer's artistry is associative, i.e. unconscious; but to deplore this is mere literary prejudice (cf. above, pp. 276-77). In her contribution to YCS 20, Anne Amory takes refreshing exception to this prejudice: "The question of how conscious a poet is of his art is equally irrelevant for bard and for writer" (p. 38). It should be added that she sometimes (but not always: cf. p. 36 with p. 58) avoids the assumption of a dichotomy between "traditional" and "poetically significant."</page><page sequence="29">Vol. 98] A GENERATIVE VIEW 297 the irreversible trick played upon Zeus by Prometheus at Mecone, the aetiological foundation-myth for all animal sacrifices. Since the phrase in question is deeply and intimately connected with the poetic idea of sacrifice,50 two reflexes of it are used by the poet here, in a man- ner familiar from Homer as well, as a ring-compositional bracket around the passage (Theogony 538-41) :5I TO) [Lv yap cLapKaS TE KaL EyKaTa 7-ova 8rqtu; EpIV t KaTEC/E7KE, KaAVaC ya}cTpl /OELl, TOS O3' aViT' o'3rTcE AEVKa PoOS SoYA17 EM TEXv EVOETLcLaS KacT E%KE KaAv'Za/cpS cip yta- .5 ,52 The same formulaic Gestalt had already been realized some lines earlier, with the other noun (477; cf. 972): 'n44av o' 'S AtKTOV, Kp'rrjS- 'S 7dova &amp;n)ov. This agglomeration, if it is not sheer coincidence, must mean either that the phrase came to the surface at 477 because at that point Hesiod knew he was leading up to a major sacrifice scene, or that that scene itself was touched off by his usage of the phrase in the earlier context. In either case, neither the apparently mechanical (i.e. phonemic- metrical) connection of the two sets of usages nor the structural anaphora of the phrases within the sacrifice scene prevented the poet from deploying his words in different syntactic patterns, or from expressing subtle and effective nuances of meaning in the latter case. Whereas 7-n-iwv and apyrqs express the same "essential idea" in connec- tion with 8-jtoS, namely " good for sacrificing " (c? Studies I 8o), note 12 50 Cf. ircova pIjpt' EK77a II. I.140, etc. This root idea is realized almost explicitly, with striking poetic effect, as an index to Achilles' attitude towards his Trojan victims at the height of his rampage; note II. 2I.I26-32, AVKaovoS apyE5a aruov, followed by unusual references to animal sacrifice to Scamander. Sometimes the association re- mains latent (e.g. IR. iI.8i8). Hesiod, of course, is not certainly an oral poet, but in his flexible and imaginative handling of some Homeric themes the technique would seem to be substantially the same. Particularly close to the present passage is Od. I4.425-28. 5i Bibliography on ring-composition as a means of organizing more or less brief passages will be found in Van Groningen, La Composition litte'raire archarque Grecque (Amsterdam I958) 50 ff.; on the same structure as large-scale organizational plan, cf.

NAGLER [I967 that -riovt is used to describe the hidden part of the offering, which is really succulent, while acpy&amp;Tt modifies the "flashy" exterior, or hiding part, which only appears so. The fact that both phrases stem from the same Gestalt and convey the same meaning on one level in no way prevents the poet from giving his realizations the proper nuances, the imagistically right connotations which make the difference between vivid and pedestrian narrative. But these connotations would seem to depend on the denotative meanings of the two words, "fat" and "bright"; and we are thus left with the very puzzling problem implied by 7rtnova 3/i.ov at 477, where phonemic similarity is not matched by denotation and the agglomeration may or may not be poetically significant. The KpT)8E/VOV group will help to clarify this problem. The word KpTSE.LiVOV itself has but one etymological sense, " top-, or head-binder" ( &lt; Kpas+ ?Eco), but is used with roughly three denotative meanings in the Homeric corpus, as shown above (pp. 279-80). These three meanings are not distributed into different formulaic patterns; indeed, as we have said above, it would be inappropriate to subdivide the group by any of the prevailing criteria of formulaicness. Some of its "family resemblances" would be very difficult to objectify, e.g. Av?opEv At7rapa KpIpSELva beside Kvirrpov KpYcE/jva AEAoyXEv, and no single family resemblance runs as a fil conducteur through the entire group save the lexeme -Kpr?86VOV, which, of course, we have chosen for the purpose. Interestingly enough, poetic signification turns out to be more consistent than any other parameter, including denotation, within this group. In its most common and least controversial poetic usage, the word Kp'8EVOV occurs as one detail-which could be called a motif for these purposes-within what I would like to call the "chastity" branch of the "attendance type-scene." This signification is most obvious in the four cases in which the whole line av-ra 7Tmpetacov oxo,uEv- Arapa Kp770EJVa is realized in exactly this dictional form; it in fact appears thus in con- texts of very similar if not identical lines and the same narrative situa- tion-Penelope's confrontations with her suitors.

Similarly for all other cases of Kp j8E,..va in the denotation "veil," "mantilla," or whatever physical object the poet has in mind,54 there is a poetic signification "chastity." However, no simple equa- tion "veil = chastity" will get us very far into the poetic artistry of the relevant passages. The interaction of word and context, the precise comment the motif offers upon the character or situation of the personnage(s) involved, is not fixed in a single function. The Kp7flSqVOV is an active symbol that can be realized with a great variety of nuances. Thus, for example, Leucothea actually hands her Kp 78,ELVOV over to Odysseus in a series of lines in Book 5 of the Odyssey, and only the immediate interposition of a poetic substitute (i.e. an allomorph of the same token) saves her from sexual compromise (Od. 5.35I-53) :55 Qsapac qV'caorTa OEc Kprp3E1tVOV ESWKEV, av1r-) ' ay Eg 7ToV OV EOvcTUEO KviLatvovra cdOv&amp;' E'cvKcV ,av 8E e K - a KcLAVWEv. We can understand, I think, why the poet should have set up this suggestive detail only to counteract it immediately afterwards, if we consider the next occurrence of the motif (Od. 6.IOO) as part of a series with this one, keeping in mind the place of the series in the narra- tive as a whole. Odysseus has for many years regularly gotten into trouble with female temptresses and is now on his way towards overcoming such a temptation in the form of the eminently marriage- able Nausicaa.56 This vrErpa, since it breaks with his earlier experiences, 53 Cf. Od. I.207-I0, Od. i6.413-i6, Od. 2i.63-65. Van Leeuwen in his edition notes on Od. 1.334, "Velamentum sumpsit. eandem ob causam duas ancillas comitari se iussit." 54 Cf. W. Helbig, Das Homerische Epos aus den Denkmdlern erldutert (Leipzig I887) 2I9-26. 55 For the diction, see below, p. 30I and note 59. 56 The courtesan who detains Enkidu in his progress towards Uruk in the Gilgamesh Epic would seem to be the first surviving example of this type, as Vergil's Dido is the one who interferes most explicitly with the hero's destiny. Note his use of the Artemis simile for her (Aeneid I.498-502; cf. note 57, below).</page><page sequence="32">300 MICHAEL N. NAGLER [I967 may be considered crucial to the overall change in fortune which leads to the climactic resumption of his total identity in all his proper roles at home in Ithaca. Thus the poet makes temptation suggestively present in the giving of the veil here, as he does in the casting off of that gar- ment by Nausicaa and her companions at 6.ioo; and then as pointedly avoids the temptation by concealing Ino in the waves as he does by concealing Odysseus' nudity with the branch, comparing Nausicaa and her aJkt'rroAoL to Artemis and hers in an effective simile, and other ways.57 But there are persons in Homer for whom the KpfI3E[LVOV and all it signifies is truly and irrevocably lost, and one case at least in which that detail is expanded to serve as a climax to one of the mnost poignant scenes in the Iliad: this is the frenzy of Andromache upon witnessing the dragging of Hector's body before the walls (II. 22.460-72): Qs2 ?abEvq) 1LLEyapoto OtEYuVoro jLLaLvaLS tor) -ITaAAojEKYpa) Kpa&amp;tRv* a4a 3' Jj aiToA0oL KLOV Ktlov a. avcrap E7TEt 7TVp)IOV TE Kat avSpJiv L6EV o'ttAov, gE71-71 ITcrl?vaLu CMT TEtXEL V ~E V07)UTEV caz2 rarzrRavc7t rex, ovsvr1et EAKOLEVOV 7TpOcEV ITALS" TcXEES E /LtV CTTOC fAKOV aKYO`TW!S KOtAaS Jt v tas 'XaXcLjv.

Here we may gain arresting insight into the poet's awareness of the meanings inherent in his traditional language, as well as his freedom in bringing them to expression. In this case he vividly realizes the 57 Note explicit mention of her attendants at I09, where she is called 7r p0Evos- 'Jtrs, and II5-i6, alongside equally explicit reference to the fact that she remains behind oC's7 when they flee. Actually, the band of female attendants itself is no guarantee against rape: cf. H. Cer. 5; H. Ven. II7, I20; Moschus, Europa 28-32, the first part of which seems to be based upon Od. 6.I-255 or a pattern common to both; cf. Fraenkel's Horace (Oxford I957) I95. It is not too far-fetched to regard Odysseus' nudity as he sleeps in the bushes and Nausicaa's casting off of her Kp7S1tW,0ov as allomorphs of the same idea. At any rate, the former fact gains significance as dramatic background for the latter.</page><page sequence="33">Vol. 98] A GENERATIVE VIEW 30I etymological roots of Kp JSE1LVOV by spelling out, as it were, the coni- ponents of the word, arro Kpacros' PaAE 3Eoa-ra (468) ;58 elaborates that idea by three more words of doubtful denotation but obviously of the same signification (469); then climaxes the whole with a realization of Kp48EuvOV itself in a stressed metrical position as runover word and leading idea of a whole verse (Edwards 138-48; the remainder of the verse is a genealogical amplification whose precise significance we shall consider shortly). With this gesture Andromache, who a moment before had ordered two a4kotwroAot to follow her to the walls (450), now painfully pre- dicts and enacts her certain downfall in every sense, including that feeling of sexual violation so cruelly developed in the Trojan plays of Euripides.59 These lines are surely among the most inspired and most beautiful in Homer.

Amory (above, note 49) S. 59 Since writing this analysis I notice the diction of 465, which surely functions as an allomorph of the idea expressed by the words ,zEAav 8e' e Kv/Jta KaAv#ev in the case of Ino (Od. 5.353)-thus Andromache has some protection from dva&amp;8ELa after all. The poet's delicacy on this point has been praised often, but never his use of traditional materials (e.g. Eustathius, Scholiast "B" ad loc; Scott, The Unity of Homer [Berkeley I92I] 2I4-I5; Bassett, The Poetry of Homer [Berkeley I938] 230, cf also I29). Cases like these, in which the evocative power of the traditional diction is realized to the full, bring home the profundity of Parry's grasp of originality in oral poetry: "the highest sort of oral verse-making achieves the new by the best and most varied and perhaps the fullest use of the old" (Studies II I4). 60 The realization of the velamentum idea as KaAVL7rp-7 points up the arbitrariness of taking any single allomorph as a starting-place. In fact, KaAV7TTp-q is probably a metrical allomorph of Kp 'SEtLVOV in the final position, where the former is always found (II. 22.406, Od. 5.232 = IO.545). On the object itself cf. Helbig (above, note 54), Leaf and Bayfield edition (London I9OI), notes to lines 407, 468.</page><page sequence="34">302 MICHAEL N.

Each of the two passages above sheds some light on an additional facet of oral-formulaic artistry. In Hecuba's case it is particularly clear (and in Demeter's tolerably so) that the lines in question are simultaneously part of another motif than the one under discussion, namely the tearing of hair and clothing, scratching of the cheeks, etc. conventionally associated with lamentations for the dead (e.g. II. 24.71I-I2). The indications would seem to be that, precisely because the traditional Gestalt is not itself differentiated into any one fixed set of parameters and these parameters themselves have no one fixed form apiece, a given passage, even a single detail, may be the outlet for more than one idea. The oral poet can achieve the same amount of am- biguity, i.e. the same rich density of meanings, as the writing poet; indeed, provisions for this would seem to be deeply embedded in the methods and materials of his tradition. We as critics must turn first of all to the traditional Gestalt, then, if we hope to analyze the meaning of his poetry; and it appears from the dual significance of the preceding example that a generative rather than a strict, classifying approach would again be the most fruitful. A more familiar and more vexed question is involved in the series of Kpr/SetVa verses in the Hymn to Demeter. Here the actual detention of Persephone in the lower world forms a long, central portion of the poem which is bracketed by the appearance of a sympathetic person- age each time referred to as 'EKaTTJ AtTapOKp 'SEtWOS (25 and 438). The noun-epithet combination cannot be without poetic signification- indeed structurally crucial signification-in these places.62 But the 61 Here, as with Ino, Nausicaa, and Andromache, there is a mitigating use of diction for the velamentum idea nearby. In this case, as in that of Andromache, there is an associated idea of mourning (see below), for Demeter throws a KVaVEOV KacAv-La around her shoulders in the very next line, as does Thetis mourning in advance the death of Achilles; note the glossing ornamentation there (II. 24.93-94). 62 The ring-composition serves as a psychological, or rhetorical, transition into and out of the underworld portion of the poem, exactly as it does for the nekuia of the Odys- sey; cf. Whitman (above, note 29) 288; Lord, STi68. Iwould agreewithWhitmanin this case, since Lord seems to me to be making a distinction between structure and meaning which is not linguistically and anthropologically sound; see above, note 44,</page><page sequence="35">Vol. 98] A GENERATIVE VIEW 303 same epithet in the same position is also applied to Rhea (4s5), and the word KpIJE(LVa crops up once more in the poem with a different denotative meaning and in a different syntactic structure (i5i): &amp;)/LUOV -e 7TpovXovaUv, tL Kp7)E LvQ IToA7)OSX These additional occurrences of the Gestalt could be considered gratui- tous associations; that is, one could say that, since the poet of the hymn was keeping the Gestalt near the surface of his mind in order to realize it effectively as an integral part of the poetic narrative whenever appropriate, it also cropped up once as mere duplication of a poetic function already served by another personage (459), and once with no particular poetic relevance (I 5 I)-just as 'rdova 8&amp;4tov at line 459 of the Theogony may be poetically irrelevant to 7riova br5 a&amp;pyE&amp;&amp; ryi later. But to answer a question like this satisfactorily would involve inordinately difficult problems of audience expectations, the meaning of repetition, conscious or unconscious purposefulness, and the like: in a word, the psychology of the creative process.63 These questions have never been answered even for written poetry, leaving aside the com- plication of oral performance, in which creation and aesthetic apprecia- tion are a simultaneous, vital interaction between poet and audience. There may always be some doubtful cases, therefore, in which the exact degree of poetic activity of a latent idea will be outside our competence to judge (cf. Edwards I39-40). Certain it is that poetically important meanings can be very deeply associated with that which we have been calling the oral formula; and it would perhaps not beg the question to borrow another concept from linguistics and say that the signification "chastity " is present at the "zero grade " in H. Cer. I5I. At any rate, it is evident from a juxtaposition of H. Cer. 25 - 438 with 459 and with Ativapa Kp7)aE,qva in the epics that to consider the epithet of the noun-epithet combination a mere metrical spacer is a and Dorson (above, note 25). Many dialogues of Plato use ring-composition in a similar way to set off the special, sometimes revelatory, nature of a central portion; cf. Eva Brann, "The Music of the Republic," Agon i (I967) I-II7. 63 It is possible-to mention but one unexplored and perhaps unexplorable aspect of these complexities-that the mere usage of relevant diction from time to time keeps the Gestalt in question from sinking too far below consciousness to be perceived appro- priately when it is to be realized with full poetic significance.</page><page sequence="36">304 MICHAEL N. NAGLER [I967 drastic oversimplification (see above, p. 276). The same is true of traditional metaphors which Parry designated as "fixed" ("The Traditional Metaphor in Homer," CP 28 [I933] 30-43), a judgment which has led to the mistaken notion that a poetically active metaphor (like a meaningful epithet) must be atypical and untraditional. That this, too, is in fact an unfortunate oversimplification will be clearer in the next examples to be considered. We must first of all observe, with regard to our initial inquiry into the relationship of denotative and poetic meanings, that because Kp?)8a,Eva denotes "battlements" or the like, rather than "veil," in the line just quoted (H. Cer. i5i), it is not at all disqualified from bearing the signification "chastity." It is definitely possible for the word to have this poetic impact without denoting "veil"; indeed to deny this would be to miss the point of the two lines from the Iliad and the Odyssey which bring out most poignantly and with such remarkable economy the same "rape" of Troy which assumes personified form in the gestures of Hecuba and Andromache (Ii. i6.ioo and Od. I3.388): p' otot Tpot',S' tEpa Kp-O78E(VEL AVW-L'EV. otov 0-rE Tpo1rjS AVOFEV AmTapa Kp7J8e4Lva. To the Greek mind the idea of rape for the women followed naturally enough upon that of apiTay4 of a city; and, after all, it is partially the artifact of translation which separates Kp7 EjLva "battlements" from Kp2J&amp;(LVa " veil," and at&amp;sw " pride of chastity" from ad8&amp; meaning roughly "pride of status." The former is ati&amp;s' as upheld by thc women in wearing veils and bringing their attendants when they must go into mixed company; the latter is at3cso as upheld by men in battle, especially in defense of their native city. Thus, in the trad- itional language of the heroic poems, idea and diction are so closely linked that, as Parry often implied (cf Studies I I26), the use of English as a descriptive tool may be self-defeating. All this does not mean, of course, that the poetic signification of the word KpTpEJVOV is completely independent of its denotation in any and all narrative situations. At Od. 3.392, for example, where Kp 287E(VOV appears to denote the seal or stopper of a wine-pithos, any notion of a loss of at'3s' must be quite inactive. One may easily</page><page sequence="37">Vol. 98] A GENERATIVE VIEW 305 imagine, however, that if it were the suitors who were "broaching" (Av'Etv) the Kp 'SE11VOV of a wine-jar for their own feasting, and not Nestor for a libation to Athena, just this signification could emerge most forcefully.64 One further group of examples must be considered in this compli- cated interaction of diction, meanings, and narrative situations. It would seem at first glance that the use of the word in question in line 2 of the Hymn to Aphrodite would again be a case in which no notion of sexual chastity or related type of atS&amp;s' could profitably be read into the phrase (I-2): AL'Solvv XpvuorE'bavov KaAcXv 'Abpo&amp;C'r7v it n% / ; /O \ ,acro/iat 7 u Kv'rpov Kp7 %cpva AEAoyxEv. The denotation here is most uncertain (and not very important for our purposes), the syntax that of the periphrastic expression for a city we have seen above (cf. also Hesiod, Sc. io5); in all, the phrase itself does not seem to connote chastity. On the other hand, we have at3otjv in the preceding line, and of course the particular goddess involved is suggestive. Whereas we tend to think of Aphrodite as representing the reverse of chastity, by the principle, ELrTpr)q,u Kat &amp;'valus vav-t'wv 7 a 3r4,65 she is also the goddess who had given Andromache 64 "Die Ubertragung des Wortes Kp '83EpvOV auf den Kp'q-rp war um so leichter, als das Rand des Gefasses als sein Haupt bezeichnet ward" (Bechtel, Lexilogus zu Homer [Halle, I914]). Compare dKpo'-roAts: 7ToACov KacrEAVCE Kapqva (II. 2.II7). An especially striking example of the use of the stem a18- in an exhortation of Tyrtaeus, fr. 6, 7 Diehls, lines 9-I2 and 2I-25, links the sexual and military connotations we have been discussing. Edmonds' emendation of the word in the latter passage (his Loeb edition) is based, as far as one can see, only upon our modem inability to understand this connection; cf. Cauer, Grundfragen der Homerkritik3 (Leipzig I92I) 650-53. 65 Cf. Arist. Nic. Ethics I I29A4, and Heckscher, "Aphrodite as a Nun," Phoenix 7 (I953) I05-I7. Here the situation is complicated by what might be regarded as another motif or as another set of associations within this one: a toilette scene is basically a feminine allomorph of an arming scene, and xapts can be explictly mentioned with either sort as a summarizing or capping detail of the cosmetics/arming sequence, sometimes followed by the notion, "other(s) admire her/him going forth"; cf. especially II. I4.i83 (= Od. I8.298, in a different narrative situation), also Od. 2.I2=I 7.63, 6.235 = 8.I9. H. Ven. 6, except for the introductory and closing conventions, consists entirely of a toilette scene (capped i5-i8) and includes, as we might expect, elaborate allomorphs of the velamentum. For some reason, however, Hesiod uses Athena rather than Aphro- dite in a parallel scene (Theog. 57I-84). For preliminary discussions of the arming scenes, cf. Arend (above, note 44) and J. I. Armstrong, "The Arming Motif in the Iliad," AJP 70 (I958) 337-54.</page><page sequence="38">306 MICHAEL N.

The diction involved in the latter scene is instructive: Kpr8E1VLW 8' E'VIEpGE KaAv1aJTo 8tLa OEacLv (I. I4.I84, cf 22.470). 7), KaL acT6 Ur70EcrTcw EAv'oraTo KECUTOV i4avra (214).

These conceptions of the veil as projector of sexual xa'pt (note its visual epithets Atrapos, uLyaAo Ets66) and as hider of these attractive qualities for purposes of modesty (KaAvpta, KaAVl7T-1p?7, etc.) are polar opposites. That a given realization can "break" one way or the other in its particular emphasis is further evidence that the underlying Gestalt is itself undifferentiated into either pole, retained in that part of the mind where polar opposites are conceived of as unities. It is on this preconscious level that Aphrodite is linked to the Gestalt as its most appropriate personification. Thus it is quite natural that the word Kp J8E/IVOV (regardless of its denotation) should emerge in the opening lines of her hymn in an expression of one of her attri- butes, q' vaio-u Kvrpov KpTpSE,(Va AEAoyXEV, just as in the surviving fragments of her epic the nymphs and graces, who are (probably) called her dJ4b[ioAot and who are helping her to dress, place crowns of flowers on their own heads and are referred to as OEatAt-7rapoKp47- S6EvoL.67 We do not mean to suggest that Kv'ipov Kp778E(Lva or QEat ALtrapoKpij8E,pvoL are conscious puns of any sort. Again, the poetic value of such associations for the traditional audience (and for the modern reader) must remain a somewhat open question for the time 66 Cf. H. Ven. 5.82-90. For factitious explanation of these epithets, cf. Helbig (above, note 54) 2i8; Leaf and Bayfield, note on 406. In my view these natural explanations, which abound in the commentaries from Eustathius onwards, usually complement poetical explanations of the same details. That is, the fact that real veils were probably made of linen and were really shiny in Homer's world by no means supersedes what we have said above with regard to the poetic function of this idea in the epic context. Homer's technique was not usually to depict the marvelous, but to transform the ordinary, through the medium of his "art language" (Whitman [above, note 29] Chap. I). 67 Cypria, Frags. 5, 6; the same function is fulfilled by the "Qpat in H. Ven. 6: cf. esp. lines 8-Io.</page><page sequence="39">Vol. 98] A GENERATIVE VIEW 307 being. But it is still tenable as a general principle, applicable even to passages such as the Kp '8EtVOV, "stopper," of Od. 3.392, that poetic signification is always latent, if not active. It is inherent in the tradi- tional Gestalt but not necessarily brought into play-into obvious resonance with the poetic context-each time that Gestalt is realized. We are thus enabled to formulate concisely one of the obviously crucial skills in the artistry of oral verse composition: when and how to bring into play the meanings inherent in the traditional diction. Whether or not this theory of the latency of poetic signification in some or all Gestalts of epic formulas be accepted, I think one must recognize that, on a statistical basis, meanings of various kinds seem to behave exactly like any other parameters of the Gestalt; to recur to the metaphors suggested earlier, they are like any other feature of the family, or any other fibre in the thread. Neither the denotation " veil" nor the poetic signification "chaste" is fully present in each and every appearance of the word Kp '8EpVOV in Homer; by the same token, there are other ways of denoting "veil" (0Oo'v-, &amp;avo's, KaAv1tLta, KaAV'7Tp7q, etc.) and there are passages involving chastity in which no such object occurs. In these latter passages, finally, the idea may be channeled into some expression of "veiling" (KaAv'rr-ro; see above, note 6o) or simply remain implicit in the situation without giving rise to any diction whatever.68 In other words, poetic signification behaves like any other parameter of a Gestalt in this also, that it can appear independently. Just as the metrical parameter - _ 2 11 can be realized with no diction even remotely like -ritvt 8r,c4o or meaning associable with the idea of " rich fat" or sacrifice in general (a'yyEAos 'AOEv etc.), so these significations can appear without this rhythm or this diction; just as the rhythmical impulse - - - - can appear without the words Atrrapa Kprq8E(va or any idea of chastity, so the idea can appear without support from rhythm or from diction. 68 For the latter group, to take only close parallels to the situation of Hecuba and Andromache, cf. II. I.345-48 (note that Briseis follows the two heralds, not vice-versa), and Ilias Parva, Frag. xix. I have been assuming that the hymns and cyclic fragments, if not texts of purely oral performances, represent artistic practices close enough to be useful parallels. Sometimes they are especially useful to indicate the Fortleben of a phenomenon beyond Homer, and thus most likely a part of their common tradition.</page><page sequence="40">308 MICHAEL N. NAGLER [I967 At this point the objection could be raised that the foregoing dis- cussion largely depends not upon a " typical formula" (such as S KE U ot, aAyE' E'OKEV, etc.) which merely advances the narrative, but upon a single, emotionally pregnant word, that is, a motif. A good deal more discussion would be required to give this objectioni the adequate treatment it deserves, but space forbids our undertaking this here. My own investigations of this question, though only prelimin- ary ones, have led to the conclusion that the amount of poetically neutral diction in Homer-phrases which are mere space-fillers or which merely advance the narrative-is far less than we would ordin- arily suppose. Despite its semantic modesty, even a unit like a4tc - dative by itself can, in the proper context, be powerfully evocative of all the honor that accrues to a person attended by chaperones or other followers; even a -rot can be pregnant with all the minatory signification of the formula (motif) 163 L U rot a4yEAos Ettt.69 Such a conclusion is not improbable in itself: If the Homeric style is as great as almost all critics have felt it to be, surely there ought to be something great about it, some explanation for its power to cast ordinary narration in a transformed medium of art-language. In our own age, according to Professor Lord,70 a South-Slavic singer will occasionally omit a structurally significant portion from one of his songs. When confronted with such an omission, his first reaction will be to deny it outright, "Of course I sang that part." Could this not mean that to the singer and his regular audience, for whom the total effect of his performance is real and the fact (or printed record) of his actual words unimaginably abstract, the "missing" part was there, implicitly sensed because part of the total Gestalt? If so, 69 For the former, cf. my dissertation (above, note i) 8I; for the latter, II. I.239, 7.48 (note az1 in 47 and Eustathius ad loc.), Od. 2.286. 70 Cf. "The Marks of an Oral Style and Their Significance," in the forthcoming Proceedings of the Fifth Congress of the International Comparative Literature Association (Belgrade I967). My own recordings in the field (made possible by a generous grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, June-August, I967) have corroborated the well known fact that Cretan singers often break off a performance of a song, not only long before the end of the piece, but even in the middle of a sentence, with resulting loss of intelligi- bility. Of course, their concentration on the music partially explains this catalexis of the words, but it is also to be explained by the presence of the omitted portion in the memory of the hearers.</page><page sequence="41">Vol. 98] A GENERATIVE VIEW 309 how much more likely that a singer with the tradition and the genius of Homer, qui nil molitur inepte, was exploiting similar potentials for implicit meanings. It is always dangerous to read meanings into poetry, but there are times when one must take the plunge. The only possible safeguard is to learn from the errors of the allegorists and other schools not to look for the kinds of meaning which would be outlandish in oral tradition, but to seek to understand Homer's greatness in its own terms. The present article has attempted to suggest that this greatness, this richness of signification, is not to be comprehended by any conceptual framework which continues to divide allomorphs into " traditional" and "original" (etc.) or which insists upon categorizing fixed "formulas," "formula systems," or even "prototypes" and "variants" on the generative level. Professor Lord stated in his conclusion to The Singer of Tales: "The real meaning of a traditional poem ... cannot be brought to light by elaborate schematization, unless that schematiza- tion be based on the elements of oral tradition, on the still dynamic multiform patterns in the depth of primitive myth." And indications would seem to be that, the more one pursues an anthropological approach to these elements of oral tradition and oral creativity, the less any elaborate schematization is likely to be useful. Even distinctions between structure and meaning (cf. above, note 62) or between (narrative) function and artistry, to say nothing of the more un- warranted dichotomies we have discussed, can obscure more than they clarify. With an organic approach of this kind it is obvious that imprecision is unavoidable. Not only are we prevented from verbally defining any Gestalt within our theoretical framework, we cannot even define satisfactorily its boundaries (if there are such) with other Gestalts as a simple matter of method. As we have seen (cf. above, note 65), there will always be cases, actual or potential, which link any series we may draw up with some other series by one or more common parameters.7' 71 Another series -mentioned above (note I2) similarly exhibits a point of contact in its final example with a different (?) series described at length by Edwards (I28): ?eE 8 EIT EaXaTrlXv (II. 20.328, cf.

The result of these potentially illimitable connections is that we can say, "such and such a group (family) of phrases has a Gestalt in com- mon," but we cannot say, " this Gestalt is . .. and is not . ."; in other words, we are debarred from classification and definition. The disadvantage cannot be argued away; and there will doubtless be other problems that have occurred to the reader, so that it may be in order to summarize in conclusion the advantages of the foregoing theory: I. It brings our concept of the psychological processes involved in Homer's versemaking into line with those most widely accepted at the present time in analogous areas of non-literary composition. Simi- larly, it puts teeth into the statements which hitherto have had to be offered as supposition by Homerists: that oral-formulaic composition is a language, that the training of the oral bard is more like the ac- quisition of a linguistic skill than the memorization of a fixed content. 2.

Thus, the polarities "normal versus variant" or traditional versus original" are subsumed in a general principle which seems to make better sense and may bear repetition: all is traditional on the generative level, all unique on the level of performance. The creative process itself may now be seen not as a struggle between the "restraint" of the past and the "needs" of the present, but as a single movement from a central Gestalt outward, if you will, along appropriate lines to the desired realization for the purposes of the moment. The necessity of determining diachronic sequences, especially where no evidence could possibly be forth- coming, largely disappears. More importantly, when all phrases are regarded as "variants," even-as with the notorious noun-epithet combination-when conditions of meter and meaning make the form of the final product all but inevitable, the unity of the style becomes clear. A theoretical groundwork is gained for the strong impression of consistency we feel in almost any Homeric passage, whatever its peculiarities of dialect. 3. Since the "purposes of the moment" just referred to potentially include poetic nuances of any subtlety and poetic meaningfulness of any density, we have a theory of oral poetry that is more than just receptive to aesthetic considerations; it is truly incomplete without them. The most challenging and compelling aspect of these remarks rests in their suggesting a less artificial framework in which to view and from which to enjoy Homeric poetry.</page></plain_text>
