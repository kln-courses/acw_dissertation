<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC ASPECTS OF STRUCTURE IN ANNENSKIJ'S "VERBNAJA NEDELJA" David Borker, The Ohio State University For admirers of the poems of Innokentij Annenskij, the lyric "Verbnaja nedelja" stands out as a work of particular aesthetic appeal. The poem is cited by Setchkarev as a striking early example of surrealist methods in Rus- sian poetry and by Karlinsky as a poetic masterpiece which alone would justify Annenskij's high reputation.' The poem presents a complex chain of metaphorical collisions producing a richly evocative polysemous message which is difficult to decipher. Nevertheless, it is rewarding to interpret the poem through a detailed analysis of the interaction of internal structures within the poem, consisting primarily of semantic and sound patterning, and of external, or extratextual structures, consisting of allusions to other literary and cultural texts. "Verbnaja nedelja" was first published in the journal Iskra in 1909 (No. 3) under the title "Subbota." It then appeared posthumously in the volume Kiparisovyj larec (1910), retitled "Verbnaja nedelja." The text is dated 14 April 1907, which corresponds to the actual day of Palm Saturday (Verbnaja Subbota) in that year. The poem is dedicated to Valentin Xmara- BarsBevskij, Annenskij's grandson through his elder stepson Valentin. Little Valja, to whom Annenskij also dedicated the unpublished poem "'ZaveSban'e," was apparently a favorite of the poet. The poem is printed as follows in the 1959 Bol'Saja serija edition of Annenskij's poetry: B )KIenTbIJ cyMpax MepTBOrO anpenI, HonpomaBstmcb c 3Be3nHOIo nycTblnHOi, Ynnblsana Bep6HaR HeuenH Ha nocne~Hseg, Ha HorH6jOi CHe)KHOI nbRaHHe; YnbIBana B abIMaX 6narOBOHHbIX, B 3aMHpaHbH 3BOHOB IOXOpOHHblX, OT HKOH c rny6oxHMH rna3aMH 14 oT Jla3ape 3a6bITbIX B MepHOf HMRe.

The poem consists of three quatrains rhyming ABAB, CCDD, and EFEF. The metrical pattern of the poem is generally trochaic, consisting primarily of ten-syllable lines of trochaic pentameter (lines 1-3, 5-7, and 10) which alternate at points with twelve syllable lines of trochaic hexameter (lines 4, 8, and 9). The final two lines of the poem deviate from this trochaic pattern: Ix x _x 2 X X X 3 X X X 4 X X X X 5 X X X 6 X X X 7 X X X 8 X X X X 9 X X X X 10 X X X 11 X X X X 12 X X X As can be seen from this metric scheme the pattern of alternation be- tween lines of trochaic pentameter and trochaic hexameter is regular within the first two stanzas. For lines 1-8 every fourth line (or final line of each stanza) is hexametric. In the final stanza this pattern is broken. The hex- ametric line here is, however, still an exterior verse within the stanza, although the initial rather than the final verse. The irregularites in the final two lines of the poem consist of a deviation in stress position in line 11 and a deviation in stress location and irregular syllable count (11) in line 12. With regard to the rhyme structure, it should be noted that all the rhyme pairs in the poem are feminine, which is a relatively infrequent practice in Russian poetry, the alternation of masculine and feminine rhymes or the exclusive use of masculine rhymes being more frequent. The use of exclusively feminine rhymes in trochaic verse would appear to facilitate an impression of continuous flow between individual verses that would not be achieved to the same degree if masculine rhymes also were employed. Two types of stan- zaic rhyme patterns are found in the poem. Stanzas I and III consist of quatrains of alternating rhyme (the form in which one most frequently finds the alternation of masculine and feminine rhymes), while the middle stanza consists of two rhymed couplets. Such an alternation of stanzaic rhyme</page><page sequence="3">Annenskij's "Verbnaja nedelja" 493 schemes in a three stanza poem may be expected to set off the middle stanza and indicate a relationship of parallelism between the two exterior stanzas. The choice of couplets for the middle stanza may also suggest the possibility of seeing the entire poem as divided into two symmetrical halves (lines 1-6 and lines 7-12). Regarding the poem's title, if nedelja is taken in its more modern mean- ing ("week"), the title can be viewed as referring to the Russian Orthodox Holy Week ending with Palm Sunday (Verbnoe Voskresen'e). On the Church Calendar it is the final week of the forty-day Lenten period (Velikaja Cetyredesjatinica) and directly precedes Passion Week (Strastnaja nedelja). Palm Week commemorates the week narrated in the gospels during which Jesus resurrects Lazarus from the dead and arrives triumphantly in Jerusalem. In keeping with these themes the holiday is a joyous occasion - one of the svetlye prazdniki of the Orthodox calendar. In the Russian folk tradition the coming of Palm Week is associated with the beginning of spring and the revival of activity, as is indicated by such sayings as "Skotinu vygonjajut v pole v pervyj raz verboj s verbnogo voskresen'ja" or "Plotva tretsja v pervyj raz na verbnoj."3 The following week in the Church Calen- dar, culminating with Easter Sunday (Pasxa), recalls Christ's arrest and crucifixion in Jerusalem and his ultimate resurrection. There appear to be various reasons for Annenskij's substitution of the word nedelja for the word subbota, used in the poem's original title. The term nedelja, if taken in its modern meaning, refers to a longer time period than subbota. This broader time reference would fit in with the notion of viewihg the evening service of Palm Saturday which is depicted in the poem as a final stage in a longer process of departing or passing, which is the un- folding of the entire Holy Week. Furthermore, as suggested, the entire Palm Week may be viewed as the final phase of the unfolding or passing of the forty-day Lenten period. On the other hand, we must also consider the im- plications of interpreting the word nedelja in its archaic meaning as a sub- stitute for voskresen'e, and hence as a specific reference to Palm Sunday. From this perspective, the events of the Palm Saturday evening service alluded to in the poem may be seen as representing the beginning of the process which could be labelled as the passing of Palm Sunday. Such a no- tion is in harmony with the purpose of the Saturday evening service of Palm Week which, not unlike the Easter service of the following week, is to celebrate the content of an important Sunday holiday on its preceding eve. It should be stressed that such an interpretation of nedelja is complementary to and, for the most part, in harmony with the associations generated by the modern meaning of the word. Several considerations must be taken into account in the in- terrelationship of these two alternative readings of nedeja. It should be noted first that the archaic meaning of nedelja (as Sunday) complements its</page><page sequence="4">494 Slavic and East European Journal modern meaning in that Sunday, as the last day of the recorded week, is the completion of the week, and thus may stand as a metonymic label for the unfolding of the entire Holy Week it completes. Such a figurative substitu- tion is in fact often the principle upon which Holy Weeks are designated. Another factor that should be taken into account are certain connotations that nedelja may be said to take on, at least indirectly, if we view the form as at least potentially alluding to the term voskresen'e. As will be seen in the analysis to follow, the idea of resurrection, which is contained in the etymology of voskresen'e, the most common term for Sunday, operates as an important latent countertheme against which the poem's more prominent fatalistic themes must be weighed. On this basis it is possible to examine the metaphorical development of the poem viewed as a linear process from beginning to end. The poem opens with a depiction of a setting at dusk in April. The yellow color of the twilight sky, in conjunction with the word mertvyj, "dead" in line 1, attributes a tone of morbidity and desolation to the setting. The morbid, sickly connotations of yellow are here consistent with Annenskij's general use of this color term in other poems, both as an adjective and in verbal forms such as pofeltel or pofeltevsij. The combination mertvyj aprel', "dead April," conveys an im- pression of the seeming lifelessness or dormancy of the early April landscape still chilled by frosts and not yet in bloom. Such associations, however, con- trast with culturally established associations connected with the poem's title in view of the Palm Week's symbolic connections with spring and revival. The temporal setting-dusk-is furthermore a time frame frequently chosen by Annenskij in his more somber elegiac poems. In line 2 the existence of an animate agent is suggested by the verb poproSrat'sja 'to take leave of,' implying an animate sentence subject. The pustynja 'desert,' which the subject has taken leave of, echoes the tone of the previous line with its basic associations of bareness and emptiness. When considered against the background of the title, however, the notion of departing from the desert also evokes rich Biblical associations. The forty days of Lent, culminating in the week of Palm Sunday, is a period of spiritual purification modelled after Christ's own pilgrimage in the desert (or wilderness) depicted in the Bible. This Biblical parallelism might lead the reader to anticipate a spiritual pilgrim observing Lent, or even Christ him- self returning from the desert, as the animate agent yet to be revealed. The combination zvezdnaja pustynja, interpretable as either the "star-covered desert" or the starry expanse of the sky itself, might accordingly suggest the celestial kinship of this agent with the starry realm he has taken leave of. The noun subject and main verb of the sentence revealed in line 3 con- tradict our expectations from the preceding lines of an animate agent in- volved in spiritual departure. Verbnaja nedelja is a segment of time, and, as such, is only capable of temporal departure. The verb uplyvat' 'to float</page><page sequence="5">Annenskij's "Verbnaja nedelja" 495 away' thus also takes on its temporal meaning as in such expressions as dni bystro uplyvajut. The result of the metaphorical collision of these two lines is that both lines are rendered more polysemous. The Palm Week which is passing away becomes personified as a person who is floating away on a journey, while at the same time the departure from the wilderness in line 2 is seen figuratively as the temporal transition from Lent as Palm Week (or Palm Sunday, which begins on its eve) draws to a close. This tension between spatial and temporal meanings of uplyvat' shifts again toward the spatial pole in line 4, where the Palm Week becomes con- cretized as an actual figure resting on a block of ice. The image of the ice block, presumably floating downstream along a river, incorporates itself as part of the earlier concrete setting at dusk in the wilderness, which is now clearly identifiable as a northern landscape. The modified poslednij 'last' identifies the ice block as a last chunk of ice departing downstream during the spring thaw. Such an image complements folk associations about Palm Week according to which the flowing away of the last ice block in the river is taken as signalling the arrival of the Palm Week and the coming of spring. The use of the adjective pogiblyj 'lost, perished,' although colloquial in style, introduces an unexpected note of pessimism not customarily associated with these themes. The adjective further personifies the passing of the Palm Week by metaphorically equating the ice block's journey and final melting with the process of dying. By this metaphorical association of melting with dying, the final line of the stanza introduces an additional non-spatial meaning of uplyvat' -namely, the process of metaphysical departure, or ceasing to be. Taken as a fateful journey which will ultimately end in death, the ice block's journey may be viewed as symbolizing Christ's own journey as narrated in the Bible. Following his arrival in Jerusalem, celebrated at the end of the Palm Week, he will be arrested, judged, and crucified. An- nenskij's pessimistic reference to the ice block may thus be seen as-an an- ticipation of the more somber mood of the Biblical events which will be commemorated during Passion Week (Strastnaja nedelja)-a mood which is in contrast to the celebration normally associated with Palm Week. At the same time, line 4 can be interpreted as characterizing the actual temporal passing of Lent, which itself can be seen as symbolized by the departing block of ice. Palm Week is itself the last week (and Palm Sunday the last day) of Lent, and its passing away may be viewed metaphorically as perishing. Thus, through the tension of spatial, temporal, and metaphysical notions of the process of uplyvala, the poet achieves a polysemous synthesis of meanings which dramatizes the unity of the Holy Week with the events it commemorates. Viewed against the formal features of the stanza, the development of the poem thus far can be seen to reveal a striking and suggestive correlation of rhyme, meter and assonance. The correlation stems from the fact that the</page><page sequence="6">496 Slavic and East European Journal assonantal pattern of the stanza's rhymes-/e/ /i/ /e/ /i/-is identical with the pattern of successive stressed vowels in line 4: "Na poslkdnej, na pogibloj sneinoj l'dine." This occurrence in a line already marked off from the rest of the stanza by its greater syllable content allows the line to echo or recapitulate the entire preceding assonantal rhyme pattern, both of which are culminated with the final word l'dine. What are the implications of such complex sound patterning for the in- terpretation of the stanza'? Generally these features set off the line in thematic juxtaposition to the rest of the stanza. By juxtaposing line 4 to the lines preceding it, we first observe a certain thematic continuity shared by all of the lines in the stanza. Line 1 represents the passing of a day into night, line 2 the impression of a human departure, and line 3 the passing of the Holy Week. All of these lines share with the final line the theme of temporal or spatial departure. On the other hand, only in line 4 are all these related motifs brought together in the single metaphor of the ice block's irrevocable journey towards death. By echoing the rhyme pattern of the preceding lines, line 4 marks itself off from the rest of the stanza as its thematic culmination or outcome, separate from but organically connected to what has preceded. The juxtaposition of the ice block metaphor, the only clear allusion to metaphysical departure, contributes a certain restrospective thematic weight or coloring to the preceding description. The metaphorical and sound organization of the stanza's internal struc- ture discussed above is complemented by an instance of extratextual literary allusion occuring in line 4. The image of the ice block floating downstream with its metaphorical associations of dying is reminiscent of a Tjutciev poem in which the metaphor is expanded to the dimensions of an entire poem. In his 1851 poem "Smotri kak na reinom prostore" Tjutiev equates the flow of countless ice blocks ("l'dina za l'dinoju") floating downstream during the spring thaw with a journey towards death. Death is symbolized both by the process of melting ("vse neizbeiimo taja") and by their ultimate destination - "Vo vseob"emljusZee more." Although at the beginning of their journey, the iceblocks are depicted as shining brightly in the sun, their inevitable end is portrayed as a process of annihilation and the loss of personal identity. In the final two stanzas of Tjutiev's poem this fate is juxtaposed to that of the individual human personality: Bce BMeCTe - Manlbe, 6o0abiHe, YTpaTHB npe)KHHH o6pa3 cBso, Bce 6e3pa3nHJIHbI, KaK CTHXHR,- COnbROTCH c 6e3,aHOf poxosoB!..

In Annenskij's poem as in Tjutiev's, the floating away of the ice block dur- ing the spring is equated with a journey toward death. The lexical and thematic overlap of the two texts suggests that Tjutiev's poem may function as a subtext for line 4 of "Verbnaja nedelja." The allusion to the earlier text underscores the existential issue of self-annihilation raised in the Tjutiev poem and also sets Annenskij's image of the final solitary ice block in thematic contrast with Tjutiev's imagery of impersonal mass death. The result is a subtle new poetic tension in which the reader senses both the per- sonal, intimate nature of a solitary departure to one's fate, perhaps modelled on Christ's own journey, and the general, impersonal nature of death as humanity's common fate. Annenskij's allusion to Tjutiev is not the only example of the influence of Tjutiev's poem on the Russian Symbolists. A 1902 poem by Blok begins with the lines "Vesna v reke lomaet l'diny / I milyx mertvyx mne ne fal"' ("In the river spring breaks up the ice blocks/ And I am not sorry for the dear dead") in which Blok contrasts his own more traditionally optimistic attitude toward such imagery with that ex- pressed in Tjutiev's poem.5 Annenskij was no doubt aware of this poem. The second stanza of "Verbnaja nedelja" continues the theme of the complex journey or movement portrayed in the previous stanza. Here, however, the setting has shifted from the outdoors to the interior of a church, perhaps during the Palm Saturday service. Within the stanza the dominant meaning of uplyvala is that of the temporal passing of the Holy Week, or more specifically the final day of that week. The events of the ser- vice are represented in terms of concrete aspects of church ritual (ringing bells, incense, icons) as well as allusions to a major theme of the liturgy read at this time - the Lazarus tale. Of these references, lines 5 and 6 present im- agery of diffusion suggestive of temporal and metaphysical passing from presence to absence and non-being. Lines 7 and 8, on the other hand, por- tray the theme of humanity, represented by the faces of the icons and by the Lazari, who are seen as, in a sense, abandoned by the departing week. Clearly, this latter notion of abandonment reactivates for the reader the no- tion of spatial displacement in terms of Christ's imminent departure from earth which will be commemorated during the following Holy Week. All the images in the stanza are connected on the sound level by complex sets of sound chains-blagoVONnyx . . . zVONov poxorONyx . . . ikON S GLubokimi GLAZami. . . LAZarej ZABytyx-which create an impression of a unified thematic movement. The unusual plural reference to Lazarus juxtaposes a new general notion of lost humanity to the single Biblical character whom Christ singles out for salvation. The reference need not be taken as obviously ironic or antireligious, as the critic Fedorov suggests.6</page><page sequence="8">498 Slavic and East European Journal The association is, however, in distinct discordance with the mood of the Palm Week celebration and the function of the Lazarus text within the liturgy of Palm Sunday eve. It reflects more, perhaps, the poet's anticipation of the feelings of apprehension and desolation experienced by believers as they relive the events commemorated in the Holy Week to follow - Passion Week. The final stanza opens with a new visual and temporal setting, again in the outdoors, which is similar to the one portrayed in the first stanza of the poem. The time frame would seem to have shifted to later in the evening, as is indicated by the rising of the moon, not mentioned in the first stanza. The reference to the moon's waning phase at the end of line 9 recapitulates the theme of dissipation and dying present in the preceding stanzas. However, by its cyclical nature, the imagery of the moon's phases introduces the im- plicit countertheme of cyclical renewal, dormantly present in the dead April of the first stanza. The reference to "I za vsex, c'ja izn' nevozvratima," in line 10, returns us to the theme of the forgotten dead, or Lazari, here iden- tified in universal terms as all who have died. Specifically, the use of the ad- jective nevozvratima underscores the motif of the journey - "irrevocable" journey towards death - which resonates throughout the poem. The preposition za, anticipating some gesture or expression in honor of the dead, stands in contradistinction to ot in line 8 of the previous stanza, characteriz- ing the abandoning of the dead. The final two lines of the poem seem to portray in a curiously indirect, disembodied manner an emotional response to separation by death. In line 11 the tears running down the willow branch (slezy po verbe) would seem to suggest an animate agent who is crying for the dead and whose tears have fallen onto the willow branch which he is holding. In terms of such an expec- tation, the rumjanye gceki xeruvima, "rosy cheeks of a cherub," in line 12 would seem to be an appropriate source for the tears, were it not for the strange placement of the preposition na which precedes it. Rather than suggesting that the tears have fallen from the cheeks of a cherub (child) onto the willow branch, the poet reverses the expected order of things and depicts the tears flowing from the willow onto the cherub's cheeks. The use of the verb plyli 'floated' (rather than the more expected tekli 'flowed') is perhaps in the idiomatic sense of overflowing or melting into liquid. A possible inter- pretation of these lines is that they depict a rosy-cheeked child (much like Annenskij's grandson Valja) carrying a willow branch home from the church service. During the Palm Saturday service children traditionally carried willow branches which were blessed with holy water by the priest. Thus the tears falling from the willow branch could refer to drops of holy water dripping from the branch onto the child's cheeks. And of course, plyli echoes uplyvala in lines three and five.</page><page sequence="9">Annenskij's "Verbnaja nedelja" 499 In such a reading the source of the flowing "tears" is from the world of objects rather than animate beings, while the role of the animate figure (the cherub) is actually portrayed as passive and inactive. Annenskij's allusion to the realm of physical objects reflects the dominant role of inanimate object imagery throughout the poem. The allusion is, however, more a comple- ment to rather than a continuation of what has preceded. Previously, the surface meaning of the poem has been dominated by inanimate imagery with strong anthropomorphic undertones. Here the surface impression of a human reaction is revealed to be in an inanimate context. The pattern emphasizes the problematic nature of the relationship of man and the realm of physical objects, which, as several critics have noted, is a major preoc- cupation in Annenskij's poetry.' To better understand the full significance of the poem's conclusion, it is necessary to scrutinize the symbolic value of the objects portrayed in the final lines within a Russian religious context. The pussy willow, the first tree to bloom in the spring has since pre-Christian times been symbolic of regeneration and fruition in Russian folklore. As part of the Palm Sunday (Saturday eve) ritual, the willow branch is substituted for the palm branches which were held by the welcomers of Christ on his triumphant arrival into Jerusalem. The palm, symbolic in Biblical symbolism of the lifegiving force of rebirth and rejuvenation, celebrates the word of Christ's miraculous resurrection of Lazarus, which was spread among the people. In the liturgy of the Palm Saturday and Palm Sunday services, narra- tion and celebration of Christ's resurrecting Lazarus occupies an important place. In recounting the actual deed, the liturgical text singles out two im- portant gestures on the part of Christ, which symbolize aspects of his dual nature. First, as a man, he sheds tears over his dead friend and, second, as a god, he orders him to stand: ". . . jako 'elovek, vladyko, slezisi nad Lazarem, jako Bog ie xotja voskresaesi 'etverodnevnago . . ." ("'... like a man, Lord, you shed tears over Lazarus, like a god, though, you resurrect him who has lain for four days.. .").8 Of these two gestures, only the human tears of compassion are alluded to in the poem. Another image from the poem prominent in the liturgy is that of the cherub. During the service a parallel is repeatedly drawn between Christ's triumphant entrance into Jerusalem on a donkey and his victorious entrance into heaven later, where he is welcomed by the cherubim: "Na prestole xeruvimstve, in na zrebjati vozsled nas radi" ("On the throne of cherubim and on a donkey you have entered for our sake"; 423-27). In addition to asserting the triumph of Christ, the comparison implicitly likens the faithful believers who receive Christ on earth to the faithful cherubim in heaven. The connection between the two is suggested by a particular motif of the Orthodox liturgy by which the welcomers of Christ are consistantly depicted as children and infants:</page><page sequence="10">500 Slavic and East European Journal "..*. iz ust ssulaix i mladencev nezlobivyx ... mnozestvo mladenc' izydosa dens', v rukax vaja derziase, osanna tebe vzyvajugde. . ." ("from the very lips of mild babes ... a multitude of babes came out today, carrying palm leaves in their hands, calling out Hosanna to you. . ."; 428-29). The point of the liturgy is to set the example of the innocent child as the model for the true believer in Christ. The verbnyj xeruvim, a doll crafted in the form of a rosy-cheeked child with angel wings which was traditionally sold in local bazaars during Palm Week in Russia, carried with it from the spirit of the liturgy the underlying association of the innocent faith of children and in- fants. In view of Annenskij's dedication of the poem to his little grandson Valja, it is not surprising that he should underscore this association. Such dedications are infrequent in Annenskij's poetry and can thus be assumed to have greater intrinsic thematic significance than they might have for some other authors. The flowing of the tears onto the cheeks of a cherub can be interpreted as symbolizing the ideal of an innocent child crying com- passionately for the dead and is clearly reminiscent of the crying altar boy at the end of Blok's 1905 poem "Devu'ka pela v cerkovnom xore," a poem ex- hibiting many similarities to "Verbnaja nedelja" in theme and style. Furthermore, the motif of the child is itself symbolic of the process of renewal traditionally associated with the Palm Week. The falling of the tears onto the cherub can thus be taken as symbolizing as well the bestowal of a lifegiving baptismal blessing onto a newborn child. Such an association is all the more plausible in view of the willow's symbolism of renewal and regeneration as well as the traditional association of holy water with Christ's tears. In this manner the themes of dying and renewal are both unified in the poem in the image of Christ's tears, expressing compassion for the dead and dying and spiritual invigoration for those to come. The initial and most frequent metric line in "Verbnaja nedelja" (lines 1- 3, 4-7, and 10) is trochaic pentameter. This is a relatively infrequent meter in Russian poetry, particularly before the late nineteenth century. Taranovsky divides the history of trochaic pentameter in Russian poetry into two periods, which may roughly be defined as the periods before and after Ler- montov's 1841 poem "Vyxoiu odin ja na dorogu."9 In the first period this meter appears very infrequently in the written literature, reflecting primarily the metrical tendency of Russian oral verse forms such as the byliny. During the second period, a new tradition is established for the meter stimulated by the popularity of Lermontov's poem, which was frequently set to music. Taranovsky characterizes the tradition as being defined by a certain thematic coloring associated with the meter since Lermontov's poem. The basic features of this thematic tradition are, according to Taranovsky, the presence of the "dynamic theme of the journey" and often an elegiac preoc- cupation of the lyrical subject with questions of life and death. As examples</page><page sequence="11">Annenskij's "Verbnaja nedelja" 501 of poems in trochaic pentameter reflecting this tradition, he cites poems of Tjutiev, Blok, and others, but none from Annenskij. The themes of "Verbnaja nedelja" appear to fit Taranovsky's definition of the traditional thematic coloring of trochaic pentameter. The dominant motif in the poem is the metaphor of the journey, specifically a spatial and temporal journey towards death, represented by the verb uplyvala. More striking is the similarity of actual imagery in Annenskij's poem to that in the first stanza of Lermontov's "Vyxoiu odin ja na dorogu": Bbixowy OAHH A Ha Aopory; CKBO3b TyMaH KpeMHHCTblIJ nyTb 6iYeCTHT; HOqb THxa. IHycTbIH BHeMJIeT 6ory, 14 3e3sa c 3BsesoIo roBopHT.'0 In addition to sharing the motif of a solitary journey, both poems open with a depiction of the same basic setting - a desert or wilderness covered by a starry sky. These thematic and lexical coincidences do not in themselves es- tablish that Annenskij was actually alluding to the beginning of Lermon- tov's poem. The image of the desert in both poems is ultimately derived from the imagery of the Bible, where the desert represented a special place for the solitary reflection and self-purification of the prophets. However, we might perhaps correctly claim that it would be difficult not to notice these similarities in theme and setting in a poem also written in trochaic pen- tameter. In accordance with Taranovsky's hypothesis of the existence of a traditional thematic coloring associated with trochaic pentameter, we might speculate that Annenskij's selection of this meter as the dominant pattern for "Verbnaja nedelja" subliminally evokes in the reader a mood or set of thematic expectations more or less in harmony with the poem's actual themes. If Lermontov's poem is itself interpreted as a subtext for "Verbnaja nedelja," then we must consider the implications for Annenskij's poem of juxtaposing it to Lermontov's poem. No doubt an important contrast to come out of such a comparison is the absence of any reference to a lyrical subject in Annenskij's poem, as opposed to the presence of an extremely self-oriented lyrical subject in Lermontov's. The effect achieved by this jux- taposition is, as in the case of the Tjutiev reference, a unique lyrical mediating or balancing of personal and general motifs which is charac- teristic of the poem's structure. In contrast to the clearly delineated "I" of Lermontov's poem, Annenskij's lyrical subject remains to a large degree concealed behind the poem's metaphorical surface. Although the initial stanza clearly evokes a mood of solitary departure, in keeping with the desert/prophet motif employed by Lermontov and in the Bible, the absence of an explicit speaker or any specifically identified animate protagonists (save through the subjective filter of the poem's object imagery) results in a more impersonal generalized tone of poetic expression.</page><page sequence="12">502 Slavic and East European Journal On the level of the poem's interstanzaic structure "Verbnaja nedelja" reveals both symmetrical and asymmetrical compositional patterning which further shape our understanding of the poetic message. The most obvious signals of these two types of compositions are to be found in the poem's rhyme pattern and the relative positioning of metrically deviant lines within the stanzas. The location of the poem's three longer hexametric lines in- dicates an asymmetric division of the poem into a first movement, consisting of stanzas I and II, in which the hexametric lines appear consistently as the last verse of each stanza, and a second movement consisting of the poem's final stanza. In this second movement we find a contrasting mirror image of the preceding pattern in that the longer hexametric verse occurs initially in the stanza. Such an asymmetric division is further suggested by the fact that only in the final stanza (lines 11-12) do we find deviations from the domi- nant trochaic pattern of stress realization. The asymmetric composition in- dicated here foregrounds the thematic pattern of action-reaction or stimulus-response within the poem, discussed earlier, in terms of which the poem's first movement (stanzas I and II) is seen as dealing with the event of something passing away (Palm Week, Christ, life in general) while the second movement (stanza III) serves as an emotional response or counter view to this event. A symmetrical tendency in the poem's composition is indicated by the existence of an alternating rhyme pattern in the two odd stanzas as opposed to rhymed couplets which form the middle stanza. Such a pattern, suppor- ted by the organization of other levels of the poem's structure," suggests both the division of the poem into two equal parts, each consisting of a stanza and one rhymed couplet, as well as a parallel (equivalent) relationship existing between stanzas I and III. This patterning foregrounds within the poem a smooth process of development moving from a beginning (the setting out) to an end point, which is implicitly compared to it, and mediated by a middle or transitional stage. While the asymmetrical com- position discussed above highlights the psychological theme of stimulus/ response, the poem's symmetrical composition brings into focus the theme of temporal transition and the process of change. This impression of change becomes clear when one considers various sorts of parallelism evident in the juxtaposition of stanzas I and III. Time references in the first line of these stanzas reflect the change from twilight to night. In the latter stanza the white moon has already risen, which is contrasted to the sickly yellow of the evening sky. The morbid yellow of the first stanza is also opposed to the "rosy" color of the cherub's cheeks, associated with health and youth. The juxtaposition of the two stanzas with its various oppositions of positive and negative values foregrounds not only the temporal change from evening to night but, more importantly, a shift from the perspective of human passing to one where death has passed and we look ahead to the question of</page><page sequence="13">Annenskij's "Verbnaja nedelja" 503 regeneration. The symmetrical division of the poem thus attempts to por- tray a turn or transition in the cycle of human mortality in which the fulfill- ment of death, which dominates in the poem, is set in poetic tension with the tenuous hope of regeneration and perhaps resurrection after death. Em- blematic of this cyclic pattern is the shifting of light references in the poem from white, in the first stanza, to black, at the end of the second, and finally to white again in the final stanza. "Verbnaja nedelja" can be seen as Annenskij's expression of the flow of his subjective impressions on the eve of Palm Sunday, when he and his grandson Valja most probably attended the holiday service. These impres- sions are strongly colored by aspects of the actual setting within and outside of the church as well as by literary and religious associations from the poet's past experience. Specifically, the alternation between the outdoor and in- door settings from stanza to stanza would seem to indicate the chronological sequence of arriving at the church (stanza I), standing through the service (stanza II), and departing from the church (stanza III). The impressions of this experience are organized into a cyclic art pattern ex- pressing the poet's feelings of both fatalism and compassion in response to the inevitability of passing and human loss. Beyond his pessimism, however, we sense in this pattern a larger vision of life as the constant alternation of phases of decline and renewal from which we can derive at least some faint hope of the possibility of resurrection. Thus, behind the seemingly irrational and noncontextual surface of the poem's linear development, which led Setchkarev to call it surrealistic in style, we find a highly organized and meaningful verbal construct of great semantic density. The revealed richness and purposeful organization of the poem can best be accounted for by an analysis of both the internal axes of the poem's internal configurations (paradigmatic and syntagmatic axes) and the external structures within this network, which include subtextual connections of various kinds.

Stressed vowels in stanza II contrast markedly with those in stanzas I and III with respect to the relative frequency of vowels of low tonality and the ratio of diffuse to compact vowels in each stanza. Stanza II also contrasts with the odd stanzas with respect to the ratio of sharped to unsharped consonants in each stanza. For details see D. Borker.</page></plain_text>
