On 18 December 1967 Ronald Callvert and Francis Murphy, guided by chiclero Crescencio Uc Pech, visited a Maya ruin in the Rio Bec région, south of the village of Xpuhil, Campeche, Mexico. The ruined building encountered was a structure with a roof comb decorated with distinctive "bird masks" (Fig. 1); for this reason the building was named the "Bird Mask Temple". §* &amp;L i -f JI3S mmMPXTT iS7 Hi I &gt;- I »wppi Fig. 1. The south façade of the Bird Mask Temple. (Photo: F. S. Murphy, 1967) Three of these masks were in fine condition, the fourth had crumbled. Callvert and Murphy were unable to find any indication that the structure had been reported previously. In 1968 Murphy published the first account of this visit in a newspaper ("In Quest of Temples at Rio Bec", Northwest Magazine, The Oregonian, Portland: 28 Jan. 1968, pp. 8-9,11) and included a photo of the decorated roof comb. One year later, Callvert published a brief report on this discovery, also illustrating it with a photo of part of the roof comb ("Search for Maya Temples at Rio Bec", Explorers Journal, vol. XLVII, no. 2: 142-148). In neither report was an exact location of the structure provided, beyond mention of its being south of the village of Xpuhil. In written communications (1986) Callvert stated that he believed the structure stood about 15 km south of Xpuhil, while Murphy estimated the distance at approxi mately 10 miles. In 1988 Murphy published his book "Dragon Mask Temples in Central Yucatan" (Scribe Ltd., Hong Kong), with some information on and three colour photos of the Bird Mask Temple, mentioning that its location was about 1.5 km south of Xpuhil. David Potter ("Maya Architecture of the Central Yucatan Península, Mexico", New Orleans 1977:4,93) reported for the first time in print the existence of a site approximately 1 km south of Xpuhil which he designated Xpuhil, Group II. Potter wrote that this site was discovered by Jack Eaton in 1966,</page><page sequence="2">basing his information on personal communication from Eaton Moreover, it was discovered that the building was the same as and on unpublished field notes written in 1971 by Anthony P. the one reported by Potter, namely Structure 1 of Xpuhil II.

No formal reports have been published to date. Eaton prepared detailed architectural drawings and Andrews con ducted a series of test excavations in the terrace in front of the structure and cleared out the sub-terrace vaults in the southeast comer of the platform, which had previously been exposed by looters. The test pits revealed various ceramic types, and date the construction of the terrace, and obviously of the whole structure, to the Late Classic period, more specifically to the Bejuco (630-730 A.D.) or Chintok (730-830 A.D.) phases.

In a letter dated February 27, 1994, three residents of the small settlement of La Máquina de nounced to the head of archaeologists of the Guatemalan Instituto de Antropología e Historia (IDAEH) at the camp of Yaxha the looting of an archaeological site on their property around La Máquina. In this letter information was given on several mounds which were illegally excavated by several local and foreign persons. Düring the looting masks had been discovered. In order to protect the site, IDAEH archaeologists were invited to inspect the ruins, which were probably un known to them. La Máquina lies in the municipality of Flores, in the Guatemalan Department of Petén; it is located along the road from Flores to Melchor de Meneos, approximately 2 km west of the intersection of the road leading to the ruins of Yaxha. On March 15, 1994, IDAEH personnel, led by Oscar Quintana, Director of the Proyecto Nacional Tikal and techni cal coordinator of the Triangle Project (Yaxha-Nakum Naranjo), consisting of Gonzalo Galindo, Miguel Ordóñez, and Fabián Berganza, accompanied by Karl Herbert Mayer of mexicon, visited the hitherto unrecorded Maya site.
