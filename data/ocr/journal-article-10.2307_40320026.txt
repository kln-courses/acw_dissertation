The so-called Principle of</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 417 Perspective has no entry. Its absence from Part I, "The Speculative Scheme", of Process and Reality indicates that it is an invention of Stephen David Ross'. The same can be said of Ross' 'Cosmological Principle'. Whitehead does, of course, identify numerous types of existence, categories of explanation, and types of necessity or 'obliga- tion' which various levels of actual occasion must satisfy. In all this Whitehead formulates the principles of Process, of Relativity and the Ontological Principle and, later, the Subjectivist Principle. The aims of Ross' discussion include showing that what he calls 'The Principle of Experience', 'The Cosmological Principle' and 'The Principle of Perspec- tive' are at odds in a number of ways and that all would be better, if not well, in the Organic Philosophy if all such principles gave ground to the so-called Principle of Perspective. Since these are not notions Whitehead himself defines, the problem of coherence among these 'principles' must come out in the details of Ross' discussion. These details are many, too numerous for a short review to cover. In what follows I will argue, though not prove, that in the representative cases I have space to discuss, Ross never succeeds in making the problems clear, and, thus, that their 'solutions' are unforthcoming by repeated invocation of "perspective". The so-called Cosmological Principle is supposed to be something Whitehead adopted, along with other Principles in Process and Reality, and is supposed to create problems for the organic philosophy. These problems are eliminable by appeal to the favored 'Principle of Perspec- tive'. So far as I can tell, the only light Ross gives his readers on this supposedly troublesome principle occurs in glosses such as 'the cos- mological principle - that the universe is unified and complete", (p. 265) Whitehead is to be taken seriously when he writes "There is no reason ... to conceive the actual world as purely orderly, or as purely chaotic .... The belief in a final order . . . seems to be due to the prevalent fallacy that all types of seriality necessarily involve instances. It follows that Tennyson's phrase '. . . that far-off divine event to which the whole creation moves' presents a fallacious conception of the universe." (PR, p. 169) Elsewhere, "Neither God nor the world, reaches static com- pletion." (PR p. 529) These, together with the absence of identi- fied Cosmological and Perspectival Principles in the Organic Philoso- phy, make it very hard to find the problem Ross' book addresses.</page><page sequence="3">418 Book Reviews Ross fails to show that the 'Principle of Perspective' has anything like the same status Whitehead gives the explicit principles in Process and Reality. Ross tells us that this is the claim that "to be is to be in per- spective." But it is doubtful that the fact of perspectives could be raised to the level of principle, consistently with the Organic Philosophy. These are, rather, facts Whitehead undertakes to explain. One could 'raise* all explananda to the status of principles, thereby creating a theoretical map standing in one-to-one correspondence with the facts to be ex- plained. But this would defeat the very idea of a theory. The traditional omniscient deity might have perfect knowledge of the universe, but one thing such a 'thinker* can't have is a theory. Furthermore, many types of existence are partially characterized by their perspectival and relational features, e.g., nexus, when these are not fundamental or ultimate types of actuality, i.e., not themselves actual occasions. Nexus are vacuous actualities. And, perspectival features go to explain various metaphysical fallacies, e.g., the fallacy of taking the relatively abstract for the concrete, as when the perspectival features of nexus, viz. extensive continuity and presentational immediacy ex- plain the sense data theorist's fallacy and the substance/ attribute theo- rist's mistake. Accordingly, there is reason to think that the existence of perspectival features is a consequence of the Whiteheadean view and not itself a principle of such a view. Ross gives no textual, hard evidence and no systematic evidence for any such principle. Perspectives are only consequences of the Principle of Process, the Ontological Principle, and the Subjectivist Principle. Worse still., Ross nowhere provides a clear account of the idea or ideas of perspective, though he finds perspectives lurking throughout White- head's organic philosophy. For instance, Ross proposes that White- head's view has been criticized on the grounds that the past cannot be real, since concrescent processes which are 'completed' in their satis- faction suffer the loss of subjective feeling, the keystone of actuality. Ross writes: "This criticism ... is based on a misunderstanding, over- looking the principle of perspective .... Being is perspectival, that is, significant." (p. 32) But if one thing is clear in Process and Reality it is that subjectively perished occasions are objectified (immortalized, as it were) in occasions in their future and are, in that sense, the real</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 419 past, relative to present processes. Further, it is also reasonably clear that Whitehead thought that the objective immortality of the past has at least two forms, i.e., prehension in the form of causal immediacy in which present occasions 'feel the feelings' of past occasions with rela- tively little loss, and prehensions of a more 'conceptual' sort, in which present occasions reproduce salient features of the past. All of this is, I think, about as clear as anything in Process and Reality. What is not clear is how perspectivity adds to or clarifies these basic features of the organic philosophy. I have similar qualms about Ross' appeal to 'The Principle of Perspective' in connection with the other problems it is supposed to solve, e.g., novelty vs. repetition, freedom vs. causation, metaphysical notions satisfied by any cosmic epoch vs. notions ap- plicable in this epoch, determinateness vs. indeterminateness, etc.. In the application of the Categoreal Obligations to the analysis of concrescent processes, the charge of anthropomorphism is likely to arise, as Ross notes in Chapter Four. Ross' reply, in behalf of Whitehead, is that these and other features of the organic philosophy can be under- stood by appeal to the so-called Principle of Perspective and not the so-called Principle of Experience. Thus, actual occasions are perspec- tives but are not, in the same way, constituted by experience. Thus, too, one need not attribute experience to lower grade occasions, thus blocking the charge of anthropomorphism. Ross' argument seems to be that one can resist saying occasions constituting the nexus of a clod, say, are anthropomorphized if they do not involve features of exper- ience but do involve features of perspective. This, however, seems rather more than less human-like, given that perspective is a matter of a point of view, significance, etc. And, Whitehead is rather careful in his claim that certain categoreal requirements of concrescence only apply to the higher level, less clodish occasions (Cf. PR, p. 388f.) What the occasions of other cosmic epochs, with alternative forms of energy, might require is, of course, another matter. The ubiquitous but ill-defined principle of perspective is, of course, also called upon to explain Whitehead's account of the role of God, in God's primordial nature, in PR. Novel eternal objects get going and get the occasion going in new ways, by means of the Categoreal Obli- gation of Conceptual Reversion. Whitehead's idea is that a new pos- sibility for concrete realization can arise if there are contrasting pos-</page><page sequence="5">420 Book Reviews sibilities, some arising from the actual world and others arising secondar- ily, as relevant alternatives, given the subjective aim of the occasion in question. The idea of reversion is used to explain how it is possible (or one way in which it is possible) for occasions to enjoy new possibilites, novelty; it is by means of contrasts in part of the past, reverted concep- tual feelings "only indirectly derived from the members of the original nexus" or past. These feelings have reference to only part of the past of an occasion. Occasions, then, are under no obligation or necessity to merely reproduce the features of their past. Thus relative novelty is possible. Whitehead says, clearly, that "The question how, and in what sense, one unrealized eternal object can be more, or less, proxi- mate to an eternal object in realized Digression ... is left unanswered only by reference to some actual entity," (PR, pp. 381-2) i.e., God in God's primordial nature, the ordered realm of possibilities. Ross sees a problem here. If unrealized possiblities are provided by God's primordial nature, novelty, Ross thinks, is in jeopardy. 'The Principle of Perspective' comes, as always, to the rescue. "Whitehead's claim that conceptual reversion is abolished through God is cosmological, effectively bringing all determination into a single order. Yet the princi- ple of perspective is essential to the uniqueness of point of view (sic) of every actual entity, a point of view irreducible to any and all condi- tions outside itself." (Ross, p. 73) In so far as this is clear, it seems to be a way of saying that every occasion at the appropriate level of com- plexity (capable of 'conceptual' complexity, for instance) has its own subjective aim. We did not need the 'Principle of Perspective' to tell us this story, however. These themes on perspective are repeated over and over in Perspective in Whitehead's Metaphysics. It is made clear that Ross likes perspectives and dislikes 'cosmology', likes relatedness and dislikes concreteness, likes the equi-basic and dislikes priority, etc.. But it remains to the end unclear how real light on Whitehead's own views are thus shed by the proliferation of perspectives. The book is difficult to read, often awkward and dense in expression. Ross began with quotations from one of Arthur Murphy's excellent es- says on Whitehead. I close with a quotation from Murphy's review of Whitehead's Symbolism, apt for this review: "A philosophy which would amplify the scope of the investigation, grasp firmly the princi-</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 421 pies involved and employ them in the solution of traditional problems, seemed immanent . . . (But) instead of mastering the complexities and ambiguities of contemporary metaphysics ... he has been mastered by them." University of Cincinnati Donald Gustafson</page></plain_text>
