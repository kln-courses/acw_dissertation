Roy Flannagan The question to ask a reviewer of a thick and rich bibliography is "Did you read every word?" and the answer is "Of course not." That's not how you use a bibliography. If you are an egocentric, you look at the index and then trace your books and articles through the book. I didn't do that. If you are looking to write a grumpy review, you master Korean, then check all the Korean items for accuracy in translation. But you might well read a Milton bibliog raphy to see what is happening in France, or Germany, or Bulgaria. Or you might look for what is happening in biographical studies. Or what is happening with Milton and Lutheranism, or monism, or anthropomorphism. I was trained as a reference librarian, once upon a time when I was a graduate student, so I would look for authority, for clarity of presentation on the page, and for ease of access and ease of reading. In that respect, the third Milton bibliography under the name of the deceased Calvin Huckabay represents an evolution whereby the various editors and subeditors have learned to correct the errors, the inutilities, and the sometimes poor design of the past volumes. I should say now that the current bibliography published by Duquesne University Press under the name of Huckabay is much improved over the first. It is more complete, more authoritative, more useful, and it has style. It is presented in a format that makes it easier for the reader to identify the various kinds of information in a recognizable order, and the reader can easily follow the various trails of information from titles to paragraphs or from the index to the source of the entry. Duquesne University Press, for many years under the wise guidance of Albert C. Labriola, and now under his longtime assistant editor, Susan Wadsworth, has produced the most useful and complete Milton bibliographies. Also, great bibliographies need editors with abnormalities.

Milton has been fortunate after death to have biographers like David Masson and editors like Henry John Todd, scholars who didn't miss a trick but had the good judg ment and good taste not to leave out anything important or substantive. Paul Klemp is sweetly obsessive and unassuming, in that he has quietly worked to preserve the integ rity of Milton bibliography as long as he has been associated with the Milton Quarterly, which probably borders on twenty-five years by now. When Calvin Huckabay was ill, Klemp helped him finish the revised 1968-88 Annotated Bibliography (Duquesne UP, 1996), "compiled by Calvin Huckabay, edited by Paul J. Klemp." Klemp had produced his independent Essential Milton for G. K. Hall in 1989, for a series under the general editorship of the great Shakespeare bibliographer James L. Harner; and "P.J. Klemp" had also produced Paradise Lost: An Annotated Bibliography for the Magill Bibliogra phies in 1996, part of a series originally published by Scarecrow Press. Paul Klemp had the integrity never to repeat himself in print: his rule was to write a fresh entry for any new bibliography he was writing. Meanwhile, Klemp was learning from his own for matting, and one notices the subtle differences in presentation of his work from 1996 to 2011. Duquesne University Press was learning as well. For the current ten-year bib liography for Duquesne, David Urban adds his own kind of obsessiveness, which is attuned to theological nuance, among other things. David Urban is not going to confuse an Adamite with a Dipper. Meanwhile, in another part of the forest In another, unique area of Milton bibliography, John Shawcross was doing his own thing, historical bibliography starting from the Restoration and documenting all books or journals that mention Milton, in various languages and cultures. Shawcross's indefatigable scholarship added layers and layers to the understanding of Milton's influence, by copying what authors like Thomas Ellwood wrote about Milton's life or work in Milton: The Critical Heritage (New York: Barnes and Noble, 1970), as well as providing a narrative about the heritage of Milton criticism. After that initial volume, Shawcross kept working on similar bibliographies, in print and in digital formats, until his death in March of 2011. Shawcross also produced bibliographies for the Center for Medieval and Early Renaissance Studies at SUNY Binghamton (aka Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, aka MRTS), starting with Milton: A Bibliography for the Years 1624-1700 (Binghamton, NY: Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 1984). Shawcross used the principles of descriptive bibliography formulated by Fredson Bowers to describe the physical make-up of the early books he catalogued. Meanwhile, Edward Jones, working with MRTS and its Director Mario Di Cesare, produced the definitive bibliography of Milton's sonnets, Milton's Sonnets: An Annotated Bibliography, 1900-1992 (Binghamton, NY: Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 1994). I should add the disclaimer that Edward's dissertation describing the critical reception of the sonnets was written under my direction at Ohio Univer sity. Other bibliographies were planned by MRTS, but they did not get into print. Catalogues of Great Libraries Yet another kind of bibliography can be produced by the collector of Miltoni ana or a cataloguer, as with the Katherine Coleridge 1977 volume about the Alex ander Turnbull Milton collection at the National Library of New Zealand or © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="3">242 David K. Anderson Robert Wickenheiser's catalogue of his own private collection, now housed as part of Special Collections at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. Part of the fun of examining that kind of bibliography is participating in the joy of the collector trying to locate a rare illustrated edition of Milton's masque from, say, 1810. It is the joy of bidding in an eBay auction or of making a discovery of value, as on Antiques Road Show. Milton Studies Comes of Age about 1970 The Huckabay, Urban, Klemp bibliography covers the last decade of the twenti eth century, still part of the flourishing of Milton studies that began in the late '60s and that caused various conferences like the Milton Symposia or the Murfreesboro gather ing, most of which have contributed volumes of scholarship on one theme or another. The "publish or perish" mentality has still not finished with American or European scholars, and now with Australasian academic publishers, even though books and serial publications may be on the way out, thanks to the Kindle or iPad or the Inter net itself. The world of book publication has evolved into the world of digital publi cation; thus Milton Quarterly can be accessed electronically (to save shelf space) through Project Muse or through Blackwell or Pearson. The world of information is one huge database. Producing a dedicated bibliography, with or without annota tions, can be done by a clever reference librarian from a computer at a library, say, in the upper peninsula of Michigan. But still, books like the Annotated Bibliography, 1989-1999 are necessary. The books that remain useful on my own shelves are apt to be reference books such as concordances (Oxford for poetry, MRTS for prose) and bibliographies, pro ceeding up to and recently concluded by the work of Huckabay, Urban, and Klemp. They are comforting because for me at least they remind me of the company of old friends at various conferences in Chicago, San Francisco, Houston, Toronto, Cam bridge, Florence, Grenoble, or Tokyo.
