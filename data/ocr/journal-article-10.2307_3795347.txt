<plain_text><page sequence="1">Siva Bholiindtha, c. 450-550 In grave and indefinable detachment, the face of Siva, the Great God, absorbed in meditation in a state comprising and beyond all knowledge, or steeped in bliss or convulsed in furor, is known in Indian sculpture on the basis of human appear- ance, and transcending it, by means of proportions dictated by an underlying geometry through which the sacred announces its presence. While the praise of the god resounds in more than a thousand names in the texts of the Ma- hibharata and the Siva Purina over a thousand years,' the countenance of his images is essen- tially of two kinds. It is inscrutable in its majesty of yogic self-absorption, bliss, and grace in the majority of images and it is unescapable in its tension as the face of the Destroyer-Creator. Ico- nography classified the many manifestations of Siva by the shape in which the god showed him- self in his manifold actions. These are rendered mainly by the positions of his body and limbs and by their attributes, as well as by the accompany- ing figures. The variations of the god's counte- nance, however, are beyond iconography; though no passing thought or emotion is recorded by its features, the nuances of their interrelation are countless. The iconometric restraint observed in the traditional form of the stone and metal images of deity was less valid for sculptures in clay or brick even where these were part of a temple. Imme- diacy and spontaneity had their play in these ma- terials as figures are quickly formed of them. The brick temples of Bhltargdon and Ahicchatrd in Uttar Pradesh (both from the fifth to sixth cen- tury A.D.) abound in figures having animated physiognomies. They are without the iconic re- straints that impress themselves on the hieratic conventions that the image of deity demands. The abounding vitality of the sculptural creations in clay comes from a seething reservoir of creativity whence the canonic discipline of the images in stone distilled the form of the cult im- age, or allowed its purity to accept a greater immediacy. Irregularities in symmetry and proportion would then enliven the divine counte- nance of the image of deity when modeled in clay. The iconography of the anthropomorphic images of India's great religions, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, was evolved from the first century B.C. in Mathura, the "city of the gods," under a Scythian dynasty, the Kusinas. Although in the sculpture of Mathurd the posture of the seated yogi for the image of deity was an accepted formula by the first century B.C., the open-eyed face of the deity, short-featured and with a trace of an archaic smile around its small mouth, is bare of any sign of introspection or inner realization by which it would show its sacredness.2 Half a millennium later, the faces of stone and metal images from the fourth century of the present era reveal the being of divinity in their hieratic, more than human, physiognomies. Nonetheless, the open-eyed round-faced type of the image retained its validity into the Gupta age (fourth century A.D.), when the transfigura- tion of the human face into that of deity was to become paradigmatic for Indian sacred art of all time to come and when, on the other hand, the artist working in clay infused this facial type with spontaneous vitality. The open-eyed face also re- tained its hold on sculptors working in perma- nent materials in regions of "folk art:' There, anthropomorphism fulfilled its needs by a sche- matic allusion to the human figure, and the face functioned essentially as locus only and frame for the staring fixity of overly large, wide-open eyes of anthropomorphic images, whose countenance in principle was meant to be a cognizance and evocation rather than a representation of an envi- sioned likeness of deity.3 These four factors contribute to the complex- ity of the effect of this mask of Siva.4 They are seen in the commingling of the achievements of two "schools" or historical phases, the one of Mathurd of the centuries around the beginning of the present era, the other, from several centuries later; the first, an archaic facial type of noncom- mittal mien, the other, the ideal, formal equiv- alent of a state of inner realization shown by a meditative mien with half-closed eyes, looking in- ward, the tense arch of the brows vaulting over them. Both the archaic and the esoteric physiog- nomies underly the arresting face of the mask of Siva. Its wide-open eyes, however, are far from looking outward, while in their spellbinding fix- edness they are also far from conveying intro- spective absorption. The other two elements that combine in the mask of Siva are a spontaneity of modeling equal to that of sculptures in clay and the rigidity of hieratic folk art. Spontaneity in rendering the fleeting expressions of a great variety of unidenti- fied characters appears to be an end in itself in a 4</page><page sequence="2">Northern India, Himachal Pradesh, Chamba Siva Bholdndtha Chamba school c. 450-550 Brass 11x9x3" (27.9x22.9x 7.6 cm) 1980-99-1 5</page><page sequence="3">series of terra-cotta relief figures from Bhitargd- on5 that look out from semicircular "windows" arrayed in two ranks on the superstructure of the brick temple above a row of larger niches oc- cupied by images of deities and scenes from their "lives." Obviously, the characters are meant to represent celestials. Because they are shown looking out of a window, their portraits include only head and shoulders. This thematically ac- counted-for rendering of the celestials by their head and shoulders alone is similar to the con- ception of the Siva mask. The eyes of these ce- lestial denizens, though generally large and open, are in each instance but part of the total physiog- nomy that reveals the individuality and ethnic origins of each figure. The sculptors of the terra-cottas of the brick temples, such as those of Bhitargdon, were schooled in the same traditions as the masters who created the stone images of the other tem- ples. The terra-cottas, in their powerful imme- diacy of modeling and suggestion of lively move- ment, however, allow also for dissonances of proportion and sketchy execution. Dissonance of proportions, moreover, is an essential quality of the small, usually metal, images ubiquitous throughout India and of no definitely ascertaina- ble date, labeled as folk art. Their hieratic rigor maintained from the first millennium B.C. to this day confines within an attenuated, abbreviated, anthropomorphic shape their numinous nature. They confront the worshiper and address him out of their overly large, unseeing eyes. (The pupils generally are not indicated.) These eyes are not organs of sight but of power. In its erect, symmetrical verticality, the mask of Siva par- takes both of the stark spellbinding rigor of the small metal images of folk art and of the hieratic splendor of stone images of the great gods. The mask of Siva is wreathed by cognizances of the god: the matted hair piled on the crown of the head cinctured by a serpent and carrying the crescent moon, the third eye of the god cutting vertically across the forehead and into the coiffure. The strands of hair are engraved with closely drawn wavy lines of radiant energy (many rubbed off by frequent worshipful touching over the years). The serpent's head is raised, as is its tail, coiling up in a circle whose sleek loop is re- peated in gliding locks falling along the ears of Siva. Within this frame the face rises above, and is supported by, three mighty volumetric cres- cents. They suggested themselves to the sculptor by the convention in early Gupta images of show- ing the fleshy folds of the neck, considered marks of well-being and beauty.7 Here, volumetrically amplified, their sequence raises the head of the god and makes it tower over shoulders and chest. The flat expanse of the latter is punctuated by nipples, which identify the chest just as the arm- lets clasping the vaulting edge of the metal sheet indicate the arms of the image. The outline of the head is separated from the shoulders by an inci- sion and triangular, peaked shapes (the ends of a head cloth?) stabbing into space and widening the base for the head. While the cognizances identify the image as that of Siva, its countenance suggests none of the names in the litanies of a thousand names by which the god is invoked and praised. Most of these names are epithets or they are derived from the god's actions and attributes; none an- swers the features of this mask, which its artist knew how to implement and reinforce by his rendering. In this young, short, and full face, wide-open eyes are turned upward under arching brows. The seemingly floating shapes of the eyes are an- chored and steadied by the third eye, the vertical eye. Their trinity is given one symbolic shape, its stem ending at the tip of the nose, whose bold- ness projects above forcefully modeled lips. Al- most socketless, the wide-open eyes float across the expanse of the face. The pupils are high up, about to disappear under the upper lids. The un- steady fixedness of their glance absorbs the smile of the lips. They are as sensuous in their overly accentuated fullness as is the almost natural- istically modeled nose. A firm, short chin rounds off the provocative countenance of this image of Siva. Although the face is modeled in high relief, the image is conceived as a plaque. To this day in the Himalayan Kulu Valley, images of similar 6</page><page sequence="4">shape, clothed and in groups, are carried on pal- anquins in procession on festival days from the temple where they are housed. This practice may go back to the time when temples were first built in the valley. Before that, and continuing along- side this practice, a stone in its unhewn nat- ural shape, but sometimes with a metal sheet placed on it, would have been known as a numinous mark of the presence of deity. Sim- ilarly, in other parts of India where an aniconic unhewn stone is the object of worship, its numinous power is exposed only on a moonless night, when the metal mask and the garments that cover it are removed and the bare stone con- fronts the devotee.8 On the basis of its style, the Siva mask may be assigned to the century between 450 and 550 A.D., although the extremely formalized and ex- aggerated triple striation of the neck is also seen in later Gupta bronzes.9 Their volumetric bold- ness here harmonizes with the swell of the lower lip, whose salience in turn is assimilated to the roundness of the beads of necklace and earrings. In tense coherence, the buoyant features of the image are structured so that the compactly de- tailed entourage of the face enhances the projec- tion of nose and lips, allowing the vault of cheeks and forehead to display the eyes. While the pursed lips voluptuously savor the smiling smug- ness in which the eyes are floating, their calm yet inebriated glance, daring, self-satisfied, self- mocking, and commanding, hypnotizes. In Vedic times, the great hymn to Rudra/Siva, the Satarudriya (early first millennium B.C.), praised the Lord of Creatures in his many forms. He is the Lord of the Living, the Lord of the Dead and of the Immortals. With him it praised the high and the low, the hunters, fowlers, and fisher- men, the potters and ironsmiths. He did not rec- ognize social barriers. In later days the Brahmins thought ill of him because he taught sacred knowledge to the suidras, men of low birth, and because he was intoxicated and roamed about like a madman.10 It also was common knowledge, which the people enjoyed, that like themselves he was fond of consuming bhihga (cannabis) and getting "high" on it. They sang of his addiction in poems and looked at it in pictures, where they saw the holy family help prepare the drink and witness the god's intoxication. This euphoria, a divine euphoria, the poor and lowly could share; they could afford this transport. They could trust their lord and enter his world of bliss. To this day Bholanatha, Lord of the Simpleminded, is the name of Siva in this aspect. Many are the paintings from the last three centuries that celebrate Siva's addiction," par- ticularly in the Himalayan mountains where one and a half millennia ago, this image of Siva as Bholdnitha was created by an unknown sculptor in an immediate vision. Although this name of Siva is not included in the litanies of a thousand names in the Mahiibharata and Purdnas, one sin- gle passage in the Siva Purdna tells of Bhol5- natha, a "storehouse of compassion.?"12 The ambiguity of this image lies also in these words. As Lord of the Simpleminded, in his com- passion he is one with them, while being Siva, the Great God. As Lord of the Humble and the Way- ward, he was exalted in Vedic times;'3 despised and rejected by the "establishment," the Brahmins, in later ages; and dear to the heart of the people to this day.14 Blissfully inebriate, of smug mien, exalted by its structure, the mask contains an uncanny power that lurks in the con- voluted locks and glides in serpent shape along the crown of Siva's hair.

In the title poem of his book Sisu Bholdniitha [The Child Bholhinthal, first published in 1922, Ra- bindranath Tagore praises Siva's dance of cosmic de- struction as child Bholdndtha's play. "The dust from smashed playthings flies out in all directions." His clothes are "cast off torn, they fall on the dust:' The child is "unclothed, penniless, self forgetful:' The images of the destitute inebriate and of the playing child in its abandon merge in Tagore's poem. It ends with a prayer, "Give to my mind that intoxication of forgetting all?'
