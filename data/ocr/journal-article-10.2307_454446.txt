<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS METAPHOR AND MIND Metaphors We Live By. By George Lakoff and Mark Johnson. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980. Pp. viii + 242. Reviewed by MICHAEL K. SMITH, University of Tennessee ARLY IN HIS ESSAY "Metaphor as Mistake" (1958), Walker Percy relates the following incident: I remember hunting as a boy in South Alabama with my father and brother and a Negro guide. At the edge of some woods we saw a wonderful bird. He flew as swift and straight as an arrow, then all of a sudden folded his wings and dropped like a stone into the woods. I asked what the bird was. The guide said it was a Blue Dollar Hawk. Later my father told me the Negroes had got it wrong: it was really a Blue Darter Hawk. I can still remember my disappointment at the correction. What was so impressive about the bird was its dazzling speed and the effect of alternation of its wings, as if it were flying by a kind of oaring motion. [p. 79] Why should the young boy have been so delighted by the "wrong" name for the bird and so disappointed by its more logical and "correct" coun- terpart? Percy feels that the mysterious name, Blue Dollar Hawk, is both the "right" name-since it is given in good faith by a Namer-and the "wrong" name-since Blue Dollar is not a modifier at all but refers to something else besides the bird. "Blue Darter tells us something about the bird, what it does, what its color is; Blue Dollar tells, or the boy hopes it will tell, what the bird is (1958, p. 87)." This ontological pairing of word and thing, which always exists in a specific context and occurs as an act of symbolization between a Namer and a Hearer, is what enables metaphor to be, in Percy's opinion, "the true maker of language" (1958, p. 96). Percy is not alone in describing metaphor as an ontological aspect of speech rather than a semantic error of language. Aristotle in The Rhetoric remarks that "strange words simply puzzle us; ordinary words convey only what we know already; it is from metaphor that we can best get hold of something fresh." Giambattista Vico, writing in the eighteenth cen- tury, felt that metaphor was not an artifice of language but a natural way of expressing and talking about the world-in fact, since metaphoric uses of language must precede literal uses, language is composed of "dead" metaphors which, if properly used, can tell us the intellectual visions of a people (discussed in Berlin 1976). Coleridge felt that the power of metaphor could impose reality, a process reaching its culmina- 128</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 129 tion in the poet who "brings the whole soul of man into activity" (quoted in Hawkes 1972, p. 43). In the present century the power of metaphor has often been recognized: Greenough and Kittredge describe "lan- guage as fossil poetry which is constantly being worked over for the uses of speech. Our commonest words are worn-out metaphors" (1912, p. 11); I. A. Richards described metaphor as the "omni-present principle of language" (1936, p. 92); Max Black argued against the assumption that "metaphor is incompatible with serious thought" (1962, p. 25); Stephen Ullmann suggested that "the paramount significance of metaphor as a creative force in language has always been recognized" (1972, p. 212); and most recently Paul Ricoeur has presented detailed studies of metaphorical theories in poetry and philosophy (1977). The list could be much longer; in fact, anyone who has thought seriously about speaking and language in the last 2500 years has had to deal with metaphor. Against the background of this tradition, we have a new book on metaphor by the linguist George Lakoff and the philosopher Mark Johnson based on the premises first that "metaphor is pervasive in every- day life" (p. 3) and secondly that "Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature" (p. 3). In a truly ebullient book of 242 pages and thirty chapters, the authors attempt to describe numerous examples of metaphor in everyday speech, to show that metaphor is an ontological phenomenon of speaking and not mere linguistic deviance, and finally to offer a philosophical alternative of understanding, based on metaphor, which is radically different from the Western philosophical traditions of OBJEC- TIVISM and SUBJECTIVISM. Defining metaphor as "understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another" (p. 5), Lakoff and Johnson describe three major categories of the metaphors we live by: orientational, ontological, and structural. Orientational metaphors have their basis in "our physical and cultural experience" (p. 14) and seek to organize systems of concepts with respect to one another. For example, many concepts are metaphor- ically represented through the spatial relations of UP and DOWN: HAPPY IS UP, SAD IS DOWN; CONSCIOUS IS UP, UNCONSCIOUS IS DOWN; GOOD IS UP, BAD IS DOWN; and so forth. In fact, Lakoff andJohnson claim that "most of our fundamental concepts are organized in terms of one or more spatialization metaphors" (p. 17). Ontological metaphors represent events, activities, or emotions, as entities or sub- stances, i.e., act in viewing abstract phenomena as concrete entities, two examples of which are INFLATION IS AN ENTITY and the MIND IS</page><page sequence="3">130 AMERICAN SPEECH 57.2 (1982) A MACHINE. Lakoff and Johnson suggest that personification is a frequent example of metaphors produced in this category. Finally, structural metaphors typify one concept in terms of another, such as in ARGUMENT IS WAR or TIME IS MONEY. There are numerous clich6d and slang examples, in the first part of the book, of orientational metaphors; ontological and structural examples tend toward differing common and novel metaphors for the abstract concepts of ARGU- MENT, THEORIES, IDEAS, LIFE, or LOVE. That novel metaphors are not mere ornaments of language but ac- tually "create realities" (p. 145) forms the basis of Lakoff and Johnson's theory of human understanding. The production and comprehension of a single metaphor cannot be explained as the sum of the logical components (features, markers, etc.) of its parts (words or concepts) as most previous generative or logical semanticists would have us believe (see Katz and Fodor 1963, Chomsky 1965, Bickerton 1969, Abraham 1975, and Levin 1977 for examples of this approach). Thus words or concepts are best viewed as representing prototypes (Rosch 1975) or "experiential gestalts" (p. 81), and not as a set of features, properties, functions, or set-theoretical notions. Since metaphor is neither logically determined nor a deviant expression of language, the understanding of metaphor must proceed like the understanding of any normal sentence. In other words, even though metaphor may create new realities, normal language competence is adequate to handle this novelty since neither speaking nor understanding take place in a linguistic vacuum but are grounded in the physical, cultural, and perceptual interactions of speak- ers with the world. Thus, a theory of truth and meaning cannot be purely OBJECTIVE, i.e., independent of use, nor strictly SUBJECTIVE, i.e., private, but must be based upon the "experientialist alternative," in Lakoff and Johnson's phrase, a position which abandons absolute truth and places an emphasis on people and situations to determine meaning and truth. As the preceding summary shows, Lakoff and Johnson are attempting a theory of human understanding grounded in the vitality of human speaking and experience and not constrained by such narrow logical and absolutist approaches as are engendered by current linguistic theory. Within the limits of current American linguistics, their approach is not only novel but perhaps even revolutionary. Considering the broader fields of Western philosophy and language of the entire twentieth cen- tury, however, their critiques of both OBJECTIVISM and SUBJECTIVISM are extremely sketchy and do not use to full advantage the more detailed criticisms of these positions which have been made by much of modern</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 131 philosophy. Thus Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, and Wittgenstein do not appear to any great extent in the book; in fact the authors ignore the whole core of modern phenomenological and ordinary language phil- osophy. At one point, they admit "It should be obvious ... that there is nothing radically new in our account of truth" (p. 181). Not only is there nothing new, but the authors fail to expand upon these phenomenolog- ical notions as they would apply to metaphor and overlook earlier work in linguistics (e.g. Stern 1931, Ullmann 1957), philosophy (Cassirer 1953, Ricoeur 1977), and psychology (such as the early Gestaltists Werner and Kaplan 1963, or more recently Pollio et al 1977) which do attempt this extension. Metaphor does pose a severe problem for any "objective" account of language, and an experiential or phenomenolog- ical account would seem a workable alternative; however, the mere re- discovery of this fact is not enough. Lakoff and Johnson do present many examples from their three cate- gories of metaphor, but even here the lack of concern for prior research is evident. In their preface, the authors concede that "our claims rest largely on the evidence of linguistic examples. Many, if not most, of these have come out of discussions with colleagues, students, and friends" (p. xii). As a result of this research strategy, the authors empha- size heavily metaphors dealing with such topics as ARGUMENTS, THEORIES, IDEAS, LIFE, and LOVE, i.e., exactly those topics which seem to be most important to them and their colleagues. The limitations of this approach in terms of one of their most specific key metaphors, ARGUMENT IS WAR, has been argued by Butters (1981). In his article he demonstrates with numerous examples that contemporary metaphors for argument are just as likely to concern aspects of games or of dances as they are of war. Thus, without a systematic strategy for collecting evidence, Lakoff and Johnson seriously undermine the gener- ality of their own arguments. More importantly, however, the work of previous researchers which could have supported and even expanded Lakoff and Johnson's work is missed, particularly Stern's book on change of meaning (1931) and Ullmann's work on semantics (1957, 1966, 1972). Ullmann outlines sev- eral major categories of metaphor which he feels are universal, includ- ing CONCRETE-ABSTRACT (Lakoff and Johnson's ontological category), ANTHROPOMORPHIC (part of their structural category) and TRANSFERS from the human body (most of the orientational metaphors). Stern's masterful book has an excellent discussion of metaphor which includes a much broader taxonomy and numerous examples of each type. In many places Stern is theoretically close to the authors and even applies the term</page><page sequence="5">132 AMERICAN SPEECH 57.2 (1982) "gestalt" to the relationships between words and concepts. These two books are not only broader and better researched discussions of metaphor, but they also emphasize one aspect of metaphor that Lakoff and Johnson don't give full scope to: the importance of the human body in many metaphoric transfers. While Lakoff and Johnson do note the use of physical features in orientational metaphors, they see nothing systematic in body metaphors: foot of the mountain, head of cabbage, etc. are merely "idiosyncratic metaphorical expressions that stand above and are not used systematically in our language or thought" (p. 54). Vico long ago noted, however, that "Ignorant man makes himself the yard- stick of the universe" (cited in Ullmann 1972, p. 214) and together with Ullmann's analysis suggests that bodily transfers are probably universal. As for the importance of bodily functions (seeing, hearing, etc.) in de- scribing mental processes metaphorically, there are excellent discussions of this in Snell (1953) and Edie (1963, 1976). More recently, the use of the body as a universal vehicle in metaphoric expressions is argued by Smith, Pollio, and Pitts (1982) in their study of several hundred novel figures of speech that have occurred in American literature over the past three hundred years. Aside from researchers listed earlier in the review, other writers have examined the use of metaphor in specific domains: Sperber (1929) and Schon (1963) in philosophy; Ullmann with synaesthesia in symbolic poets (1957); Asch for metaphoric use of adjectives to describe people in various cultures (1955); Brown et al. (1957) for music terminology; Stelzner (1965) for rhetoric; Dreistadt for science (1968); Turbayne (1962) for mechanical metaphors; Safire (1978) for politics; and Pollio et al. (1977) for psychotherapy and education. This list presents only a few major examples in English and certainly does not include examples of metaphor which could be culled from collections of slang, idioms, or proverbs, none of which, seemingly, were consulted by Lakoff and Johnson. As a serious scholarly work, then, this book has shortcomings, with the most important a lack of adequate appreciation for prior research which would allow the reader to generalize the We of the Metaphors We Live By to an audience larger than the authors themselves. However, as a stimu- lus to research into the exciting and important problems that metaphor poses for an understanding of language and thought, we can only hope that Lakoff and Johnson's enthusiastic treatment of the role metaphor should play in current linguistic theory may prove more productively generative than the theoretical attempts of their transformationalist and post-transformationalist predecessors.</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS 133 REFERENCES Abraham, W. 1975.
