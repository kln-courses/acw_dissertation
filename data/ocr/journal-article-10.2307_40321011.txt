<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vital Liberties in American Democracy KrzysztofPiotr Skowronski Although it has always thought itself in an eminent sense the land of freedom, even when it was covered with slaves, there is no country in which people live under more overpowering compulsions. G. Santayana1 Introduction It is a widely-held opinion that the United States is the country of democracy. Unfortunately, its history does not seem to be essentially different from the histories of other countries in this respect. Many of its most crucial arrangements, political and social, were not undertaken democratically at all. Its very emergence meant the merciless conquest of the Native Americans' lands and their ruthless extermination. The shape of its borders was the aftereffect of wars, annexations, and business transactions, like everywhere else. Slavery and racial segregation, practiced for centuries, were abolished not as the result of democratic procedures, but rather by prolonged clashes, massive demonstrations, often accompanied by violent riots. On the other hand, such pillars of the American social order as private property rights, the right of inheritance, compulsory education, the monogamous family, even conscription have been thought to be obvious enough to have avoided serious debates or nationwide referenda through decades. One may claim, then, that the situation where freedom is preconditioned by such definite and unsubvertible principles, resembles the impotent freedom to use one's native or favorite language in places where only English is official and commonly spoken. The question arises how to cope with the paradox - if we accept its premises - that "in a country where all men are free, every man finds that what most matters has been settled for him beforehand (COt/5, p. 211)?" Even more interestingly, in the preface to Character and Opinion in the United States (1920), George Santayana's major book dedicated to American affairs, one can read the author's note that seems more accurately addressed to readers under some anti-democratic regimes rather than to the free people of a free America: I suspect that my feelings are secretly shared by many people in America, natives and foreigners, who may not have the courage or the occasion to express them Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Summer, 2004, Vol. XL, No. 3</page><page sequence="2">5 14 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski frankly. (COL/5, p. vi) What is the range, then, of liberties in American democracy?2 - the answer to this question will be searched for in the present paper; however, I would like to look at it in the light of Santayana's concept of vital liberty^ that is, the "exercise of powers and virtues native to oneself and to one's country."3 I do so in the hope that I may understand more such reserved and chilly attitudes toward American democracy as the one expressed in the motto above; after all, sharing even the strongest sympathy for American democracy does not preclude studies on its, possibly, weakest points. Santayana devoted much of his attention to the problem of liberty in the America he knew from his own prolonged observations, and from active participation in her intellectual life. The sensitivity of his criticism, the depth of his insight, and, finally, the stance of an America-loving foreigner he assumed - make his voice unique and pregnant with meaning at the same time. Like Alex de Tocqueville almost a hundred years before, Santayana views America from without, from a detached horizon, from a visitor's perspective, from a certain distance in order to give us some reflections, observations, and clues, although neither a social theory nor a whole embracing picture of American life. In contrast to de Tocqueville, however, he tries to maintain a more cosmopolitan position, that is, free from comparisons, meaning: better types of political ideologies, religious convictions, social orders, and historic traditions existing simultaneously someplace else, unless in one's imagination. Vacant Freedom and Vital Liberty It is a common experience of all children as well as many revolutionaries that a decisive, strong, and vigorous willingness to break free, to ease the discomforts, and to destroy the present oppression is followed by a vague idea of what to do next, that is, after freedom from restraint has been achieved. A negative type of thinking, i.e. a devotion to fight against^ to get rid of the burden, to shake off the inconvenient crust, is essentially different from striving for the realization of a desired state of affairs, the fulfillment of one's inner potentiality, and the introduction of one's vision into reality. The former is usually concluded by a vacuum or a space waiting to be filled, the latter is an attempt to fill this emptiness by some definite substance, to materialize a given state of things according to a more or less definite plan, and to arrange the reality in some chosen way. These two can be - although, logically taken, they do not have to - mutually connected.4 Vacant freedom may be a precondition of vital liberty and does not require vital liberty as its necessary complement. For example, the American pioneers sought in the New Land an asylum from European persecutions, that is, they wanted vacant freedom; this wish, however, was assisted by another wish, namely to cultivate their own traditions, customs, and values - to put it very briefly, they wanted their vital liberties5 to thrive. For</page><page sequence="3">Vital Liberties in American Democracy 515 many of them, America was the place where they were able to prosper, materially and spiritually, side by side with other groups or communities and to enjoy their own ways of living according to their own faiths and habits. From this viewpoint, America was indeed a uniquely friendly and liberal land, especially for those who did not have to face the perils from the natural environment or the Native Americans. A full exercise of vital liberties means the activation of the people's latent energies and evoking their inner potentialities,6 all in the name of the moral autonomy of each of them. This also means a better recognition, appreciation, and exploration of the traditions, heritages, arts, philosophies, cultures, and customs, sometimes centuries old, by means of which human self-fulfillments, perfections, and happiness can be achieved. If these have been neglected and vital liberties reduced to removing obstacles without being stimulated by a definite impulse or filled by positive substance, then vital liberties stay meaningless. That is why Santayana emphasizes that his notion of vital liberty refers to the distinct types of human (as well as non-human7) excellences that are realized by those for whom these excellences are the articulations of their deepest needs and passions. Santayana tries to avoid an anarchic egoism and sees the individual as someone rooted in one (or more) of many groups whose unities are based upon profound and integral principles: national, religious, communal, professional, ideological, philosophical, etc. They constitute separate, yet noble, fine, and eminent traditions, each with its own long and beautiful inspirations, symbols, and wisdom, whose diversity and qualities manifest the abundance of the natural variegation of life. Ideally, almost each of them is worthy of being followed for good; they are not like products to be consumed, or masks to be taken on for a while, and then, thrown away when they become boring, or unnecessary; instead, they constitute the indelible set of standards, sympathies, and norms. Practically, each of them, if perfected and not distorted or abused, somehow shows a unique and a special sort of an outstanding life, lofty aims, and, moreover, can give their followers happiness and a sense of life. They have, then, a deeply moral and axiological meaning; they do not refer to shallow and momentary satisfactions, but rather to those vital predilections, desires, needs, ambitions, and expectations that are latent in one's nature, and wait for the realization when external conditions permit. One could wish human nature(s) were appropriately and briefly defined for cognitive, legal, political, or social reasons; then, all human beings might be embraced, classified, and apprehended according to a few common standards. Their developments could be put into clear frameworks, and those who violated, or trespassed, upon such frameworks would be swiftly dealt with, and, thus, the safety, happiness, and liberties protected. However, the debates on the metaphysical foundations and the anthropological assumptions are far from any final conclusions. From the standpoint of Santayana's anthropology, human natures and their demands are differentiated and cannot be - unless by the force</page><page sequence="4">516 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski of external compulsion - narrowed down to a limited range of the defined descriptions, codified norms, and classified standards. He emphasizes the fact that morally all of us "exist by distinction, by integration round a specific nucleus according to a particular pattern"8 and the realization of the vital liberties makes people still more different and unique, rather than more anonymous and similar. This pluralism of values refers to the states of affairs too: in truth good qualities are all different in kind, and free lives are different in spirit. (...) In reality, at the center of every natural being there is something individual and incommensurable, a seed with its native impulses and aspirations, shaping themselves as best they can in their given environment. (COUSy p. 166) In his "Marginal Notes on Civilization in the United States," he adds: "Anything good intrinsically, anything loved for its own sake, is its own standard, and sufficient as it is;"9 and he makes it clear that only blindness or ignorance can make them stay in remote obscurity. American Democracy Against Vital Liberties The notions of liberty and democracy do not have to be, as they often are, closely related. Monastic communities, for instance, can obey democratic procedures (voting, the respect which should be given by all members to the rules and regulations, the limited time of the given governing bodies), but they are closed, or perhaps even hostile, to the incompatible lifestyles and the un- orthodox manifestations of vital liberties. Likewise, American democracy with its optimism and hope for nationwide cooperation is, according to Santayana, based upon the theoretically fragile and practically unconfirmed assumption that, at the very bottom, everyone - including Native Americans, Puritans, Orthodox Muslims, businessmen, Communists, or hippies - wants the same thing. A completely different approach towards this issue is the reason why he says the following: I will venture this assertion, which may seem a paradox to the reader: that to be liberal is contrary to the genius of democracy. Liberalism is individualistic, respectful towards things alien, new, or unknown; it welcomes diversity; it abhors compulsion; it distrusts custom.10 In Character and Opinion in the United States^ the position stating that democracy is, essentially, exclusive and non-democratic itself, has been expressed quite openly:</page><page sequence="5">Vital Liberties in American Democracy 517 In a hearty and sound democracy all questions at issue must be minor matters; fundamentals must have been silently agreed upon and taken for granted when the democracy arose (COC/S, p. 206) ... If they ever became a real distinction and variety of life, if they arrogated to themselves an absolute liberty, they would shatter the unity of the democratic spirit and destroy its moral authority. (COUS, p. 208) Santayana's terms liberalism and liberty must not be mixed up with the ones related to a political doctrine or a form of government; the notions used by him do not refer to any specific existing models of a social order, nor any definite political party's program of any country. This ambiguity in terminology can be illustrated, for example, by juxtaposing liberal arts, which Santayana strongly advocates, with industrial or commercial liberalism^ which he strongly criticizes; the former expresses free mind, while the latter militates against it. Liberalism in its former meaning takes on its tolerance from the acceptance of the fact that all kinds of living beings - unless (self)destructiveu - strive to preserve and to reproduce different sorts of the perfections they cherish, they love, and they have been dedicated to. It tries to understand these perfections and look at them as the manifestations of the unique souls of their exponents, without any tendencies to dominate them and to impose on them any external rules. The acceptance of such an approach towards the variegation of life requires a "subjective principle of thought", which throws the mind open to all alternatives, and which is friendly, within the limits of common sense, toward all types of societies and communities, as well as toward the common good that is to be realized by them or for them. This "liberalism in thought," as an attitude or an intellectual position, is the "impartial philosophy,"12 that is, the one that does not favor one hierarchy of values over another nor advocate one order at the cost of another, at least ideally. Impartial or disinterested philosophy avoids engagement in promoting some vested interpretation of the world and elevating some local prejudices, social stereotypes, and biased opinions over others. Characteristically and interestingly, Santayana strongly rejects the claim that he is interested in the introduction of his own partisan political concept or a clearly defined vision of a social order; in many places he assures his readers that he welcomes other thinkers' ways, the more if they are complete, coherent, and bear witness to the authentic depths of the creators' souls If any community can become and wishes to become communistic or democratic or anarchical I wish it joy from the bottom of my heart. I have only two qualms in this case: whether such ideals are realisable, and whether those who pursue them fancy them to be exclusively and</page><page sequence="6">518 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski universally right: an illusion pregnant with injustice, oppression, and war.13 That America activates human capacities there is no doubt, and discussion is unnecessary; Santayana joins the innumerable voices treating America's soil as fertile for any sort of seed to be planted. The factual narrowing down of these varieties into one sort - this seems to be Santayana's accusation of the American democracy; it activates the human energies within a closed range of possibilities within the commercial sphere of action and shuts down others. From the point of view of the impartial philosophy, the moral justification of such an imposition is doubtful. To assert that one such political or vital interest, say the Jewish or the Anglo-Saxon, coincides with the total inspiration of the universe, is egotism in excelsis, and a plain illusion of animal vanity and egotism. (7, p. 492) In his opinion, the field for the realization of human nature(s) in America has been reduced to the realizations of different variants of only one type of human development, one type of aims and standards, that is, those leading to material prosperity. The highlighted and promoted variety of goods has been limited to one type of object, that is, the goods to be consumed. One can illustrate this scarcity or narrowness by means of the simile where the supermarket is believed to be the place of free choice for an unlimited variety of goods. There, the number of departments is curtailed only by the number of customers; one can order or choose, if rich enough, anything one wants. The dissatisfaction with certain types of products can easily be overcome by the satisfaction gained elsewhere. However, the supermarket is a place for the promotion of one type of mentality, one type of need, one type of expectation, and one type of freedom. In the area of this type of human growth, people are free, indeed, almost unimaginably in the American democracy; the freedom from constraints in doing business seems the greatest among all the countries existing in history. However, "[i]f you refuse to move in the prescribed direction, you are not simply different, you are arrested and perverse."14 The liberties, sciences, virtues, religions beyond the prescribed areas are marginalized, if tolerated at all, ostracized or scorned. Instead, then, of dealing with the wide spectrum of hierarchies of values, American democracy deals with a wide spectrum of one hierarchy of values emerging from one type of vital liberty. Therefore, what Santayana wrote on America in his "Genteel American Poetry", seems to be, in this context, less shocking: if the country was not dominated by any church or aristocracy, it was dominated no less rigidly by</page><page sequence="7">Vital Liberties in American Democracy 519 democracy and commercialism. (GSAy p. 148) For Santayana democracy as a system having a single soul is disfavored in the name of democracy understood as a sort of "procedure" where there is ample space for many orders - an ideal that can possess even aesthetic qualities.15 If we understand democracy as an ideal where there is space for possibly all of the vital liberties, Santayana is a genuine democrat.16 If, however, democracy means that the ruling demos or "average men" execute their own vital liberty at the cost of others - he is not such a genuine democrat. His claim that there are many rival realizations of human perfection possible is assisted by his deliberation about the conditions that should provide enough room and stimulation for many vital liberties to thrive, as if in a paradisiacal garden in which there is space for all types of plants to grow, each in its own way, each appreciated individually, and each seen as an unrepeatable beauty, not just taken collectively and superficially as flora. Santayana had expected from democratic Americans openness to the richness of the world before and beyond America: "It was what I might call the sporting mind, unbiased intelligence, spreading freely from youthful curiosity to the interests of the world in general, including the adventures of the philosophers: a sporting mind found in the old wits, in Montaigne and Voltaire, in Hobbes and in Dr. Johnson, but seldom found anywhere nowadays, least of all in America" (7, p. 342-343). In other words, Santayana had expected the ideals of, what he calls, classic liberty to be implemented in the ordinary practice of American life. Classic Liberty The term "classic liberty" does not denote another type of liberty but rather it indicates that there were periods of time during the classic era when vital liberties materialized or were at least understood better than they are, in Santayana's opinion, in American democracy. The extraordinary fertility of Greek culture - from the Ionians down to the Neo-Platonists - resulted in the emergence and functioning of a number of popular, yet divergent, complete, and noble systems of ethics (e.g. Pythagorean, Platonic, Aristotelian, cyrenaic, cynic, stoic, epicurean), fully manifesting the genuine needs and desires of distinct human beings; on the other hand, these systems offered separate, equally fine, and morally good ways of dealing with the unpredictability of fate, and they showed the possibilities of the harmonious coexistence of one with another. This was not confined to the individual life, but also spread to many areas of the public one; competitive forms of political systems (Spartan rigor, Athenian democracy, Macedonian monarchy), diverse theologies (Homeric, orphic, epicurean, stoic), discrepant concepts of love (sensual, ascetic, intellectual, aesthetic), specific articulations of the aesthetic sensitivities (e.g. by the notion of Kalokagathia)^ and the multitude of artistic expressions with their enormous impact upon the character of the polis. Here, human natures and human liberties</page><page sequence="8">520 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski were free to appear, develop, and collect many followers among the members of the public. Another type of classic liberty could be found in the Middle Ages. In the Franciscan idea of democracy, the liberties of separate natures were taken for granted and their dignities not reduced to one, prevalent or preeminent type of genius. Instead of the militant imposition of one will upon the others, there was an understanding of and an affection towards the various standards existing within the earthly life. This sense of brotherhood, so beautifully articulated in Fioretti, with the distinct forms of life, however alien, gave a secure position in a genuine home, with an appreciation for the many other forms of existence. In Dante, mankind was a kind of unity of those who live, those who have ceased to live, and those who are to come. In his Comedia Divina, there were many dimensions through which life could be approached, appreciated, and savored; each was respected as a unique and special world in itself - one can even assert, that this variegation of types of life, of the incompatible predications, of the diverse perfections, and of the different loves was a pre-condition of a worthy community taken as a whole. Another form of classic liberty can be seen, although in a very special way, in the Buddhist idea of the karman, that is, the pilgrimage of souls. This transmigration is not confined to the same forms of life, for instance, the anthropomorphic one, but stretches to all the species possible. The souls of the deceased, depending upon the deeds committed during the past life, can visit the bodies of other animals; the confines of the biological species as well as the limits of time and the borderlines of geographical space - so essential for the anthropocentric minds of modern Westerners - being easily transgressed and believed to be of secondary importance. Here, the unity of life is confirmed, if not strengthened, by the great variety of its forms; the potential area of the liberty is, therefore, much vaster than the one restricted to this body, this generation, this place, thisúmc, and this ]ob to be done. In the Renaissance, the ideals of freedom and liberty gained a special tint. The comprehension of one's own subjective world is as if in a microcosm in which objective reality focuses, assumed a form of seeing life as an art. It was Micheal de Montaigne's vital liberty to devote himself to a variety of actions and professions. Apart from the active participation in the solutions of social conflicts, he became, as we know from his Essays, a full-scale humanist who recognized, appreciated, and meditated on religion, history, politics, geography, and philosophy. The consciousness of one's own separateness, the beauty of one's originality as well as the individual's right to cultivate such ideas, reached its climax. The Renaissance-type of attitude was close to Santayana's father, Augustin; he studied law and philosophy, painted Goya-school pictures, wrote a book on one of the Philippines' islands, translated Seneca's writings into Spanish - all this apart from being, for some period of time, a Governor of the Batang Island in the Philippines.</page><page sequence="9">Vital Liberties in American Democracy 52 1 One of the most characteristic features of all these concepts is an indifference to the multiplication of money and to the endless accumulation of material wealth. In due time, however, this type of mentality changed, although not everywhere. The prosperous and ultimately tolerant type of social order was foreshadowed by Francis Bacon's New Atlantis, where the balance between means and ends of human activity was adequately kept. The material and technological progress was seen to be the means (not an end in itself) for the exploration of human potentialities, even if not utilitarian in any sense, in all directions possible. The appreciation of the beauties around, the delight in rival sorts of nobility and splendor, as well as the curiosity about the fruits of foreign traditions, inventions, and minds lacked a will to dominate other people, to conquer other lands, and to discredit other ways of life. Bacon, as Santayana puts it, "nursed the classic ideal of a hierarchy of the arts, with a magnificent pageant of virtues and dignities, like the celestial choirs come down to earth. His New Atlantis was not to be merely prosperous, but solemnly ordered, glorious, and beautiful" (/, p. 201). Classic liberty was not absent on the American soil in the first days of her modern history. The spontaneous democracy of the pioneers existed side by side with the theocracy of the Puritans, and this, in turn, side by side with other denominations; the merchants could ply their vocation without interrupting the lives of hermits or vagrants. The immigrants from the English speaking countries coexisted linguistically with those from Scandinavia or Eastern Europe - all having room enough to thrive freely in their own ways. However, since the days of industrial liberalism that leveled everything down to "a single cheap and dreary pattern" (DP, p. vii), the country has changed for good. Progress started to mean "vast numbers, material complexity, moral uniformity, and economic interdependence" (SE, p. 180), all based upon a conviction about the uniformity and compatibility of human needs and interests, these interests being "to exploit business opportunities and organise public services useful to all" (COUS, p. 197- 198). Then came the imposition of one kind of social and political order rather than the protection of a variety of orders; just one denominator, that is money, at any price was introduced, a prosperity-oriented society was formed, and the influence of the unsuitable marginalized. Whose imposition it was and who was responsible for the modeling of this situation is the question that remains to be answered. Is Self-Made Man Really Self-Made? One of the icon-terms of Americanism, "self-made man," suggests that an individual is free to select the values, goods, and lifestyles according to his/her particular preferences, vital interests as well as ambitions, tastes, and sentiments. That this is not really the case is Santayana's point in his reservations about American democracy. He states that each individual in the U.S. is under constant social pressure to be successful in one direction and is stimulated by one type of</page><page sequence="10">522 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski career from the very beginning of the process of upbringing and school education. These compulsions make an individual accommodate, by any means, to the prevailing system rather than focus freely on his/her vital liberty, unless they, more or less accidentally, dovetail. In The Last Puritan: A Memoir in the Form of a Novel Santayana writes: It is unfortunate to have been born at a time when the force of human character was ebbing, while the tide of material activity and material knowledge was rising so high as to drown all moral independence. (7F, p. 143) In the realm of matter there must be clashes between the agents and Santayana knows it very well; the material needs and spiritual ambitions of each living being must be met and satisfied. The problem is, however, that the richest country and the one with the widest opportunities does not make enough space for all types of self-creation possible, evoking instead stereotypes of social behavior that lead to the conviction that "a man is useless unless he makes money" (7, p. 216) and forming a type of mentality according to which u[t]he great and good men were in themselves no better or wiser than the failures: they merely happened to be on the winning side" (TV, p. 129). The accumulation of material wealth does not make liberty more classic and more natural at the same time, that is, more and more variegated and does not - although it could - secure the progress and development of divergent vital liberties. There are many instances of this "democratic intolerance" (7F, p. 131) that Santayana gives of his relations and friends who - although enormously intelligent, keen, sensitive, and simply good people - suffered from a lack of place in free and democratic America. Let me present just a few of the examples, all taken from his autobiography Persons and Places^ not just to illustrate the problem but also to show Santayana's sarcastic tone while writing about American democracy. Thus, two of his relatives, having artistic predilections, gave them up being "without money enough to be important men about town. Superfluous persons who felt themselves superfluous" (7, p. 72-73). For another, the "fact that he was a Jew and that his father kept a "dry-goods store" cut him off, in democratic America, from the ruling society" (7, p. 217). Still another one, married overseas to a black woman, with whom he was not able even to travel in the U.S. for she could not even enter a hotel (cf., 7, p. 386). Another one, a "typical Yankee" from Boston, planned a music career, yet "[m]usic would be an acceptable profession [only] if you could begin by being famous. It was not acceptable if you were to begin at the foot of the ladder, and perhaps remain there" (7, p. 255). Santyana was even "satisfied" with Professor Norton's nephew's fragile health, for if he had been thoroughly healthy he would have had to go into business, "because according to the ruling code, this would have been his duty to society" (7, p. 225). However, there was one, who, due to his artistic and aristocratic manners, "could feel and actually be perfectly free, even in a</page><page sequence="11">Vital Liberties in American Democracy 523 democracy" (J, p. 349). Santayana generalizes upon the obligatory character of the social life in America that he knew himself: If, for instance, I am compelled to be in an office (and up to business, too) from early morning to late afternoon, with long journeys in thundering and sweltering trains before and after and a flying shot at a quick lunch between, I am caught and held both in soul and body; and except for the freedom to work and to rise by that work - which may be very interesting in itself - I am not suffered to exist morally at all. My evenings will be drowsy, my Sundays tedious, and after a few days' holiday I shall be wishing to get back to business. Here is as narrow a path left open to freedom as is left open in a monastic establishment, where bell and book keep your attention fixed at all hours upon the hard work of salvation - an infinite vista, certainly, if your soul was not made to look another way. (...) Even what is best in American life is compulsory - the idealism, the zeal, the beautiful happy unison of its great moments. You must wave, you must cheer, you must push with the irresistible crowd; otherwise you will feel like a traitor, a soulless outcast, a deserted ship high and dry on the shore. (COC75, p. 210-211) Self-made man, then, is not free enough to reject aiming at material success with the risk of being pushed outside the mainstream of social life along with its privileges, prestige, and respect. To be poor in order to be simple, to produce less in order that the product may be more choice and beautiful, and may leave us less burdened with unnecessary duties and useless possessions - this is an ideal not articulate in the American mind. (COC/5, p. 188) On the other hand, self-made men appear to be not autonomous enough to resist some disadvantageous consequences of this wholehearted devotion to prosperity. Wealthy people so easily become subordinate to business commitments that it is difficult to see any borderline between the freedom they constantly declare, and the addiction to material goods. When you possess things without being possessed by them, freedom from this type of slavery is assured; however, this, unfortunately, very often is not the case. While in America you can</page><page sequence="12">524 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski freely abandon or renounce your religion, your original nationality, your native language (unless English), and your traditions - you can never give up material prosperity, which is too essential for existence there. Santayana, himself originating from a poor country, perceived it with acuteness and distaste. Free choices are really free when sufficient self-knowledge on the one hand, and the knowledge of the world on the other, make it possible to select and rationalize the ways of getting what one is genuinely looking for. If this is lacking, that is, if the choices are unnecessarily reduced and when the lures of some goods are propagated and the attractions of others neglected, the people's consciousness of these choices is limited or distorted and the question of any moral justification of such a system is open. For instance, the extremely high level of the institutionalization of social life delineates the clearly restricted areas for a free realization of the postulates, wishes, and the methods to materialize them; those who undermine the basis of such delineation, or who just do not fit are, as if a priori^ out of the mainstream of public life, unless somehow rich anyway. Although social institutions have been invented to serve, it is a common experience of ours that it is the anonymous power of big corporations and omnipresent institutions that become the subject rather that the object of the actions. We are not treated as separate human beings, independent entities or the centers of existence, like Leibniz's monads or Socratic individuals, with our uniqueness, unrepeatable qualities, and special capacities, but rather we are reduced to the instruments, the links in the chain, and the role players: laborers, taxpayers, and clients. The growing significance of institutions - that are not democratic or liberal in any sense - has already made them stronger than many medium-size independent countries, and most probably they will become the global centers of influence and power soon. Looking at things from this point of view, one can say that self-made man in modern America is really self within the strictly delineated confines imposed as if from above. Again, it is a part of Santayana's own experience of commercial liberalism in America and elsewhere that: a man finds his life supervised, his opportunities pre- empted, his conscience intimidated, and his pocket drained. Every one he meets informs him of a new duty and presents him with a new subscription list. At every turn he must choose between being incorporated or being ostracized. Indeed, the worst and most radical failure in his fabled liberty of choice is that he never had a choice about his environment or about his faculties, and has to take his luck as to his body, his mind, his position, his country, and his family. Even when he may cast a vote his vote is far from decisive. In electing a government, as in selecting a wife, only two or three</page><page sequence="13">Vital Liberties in American Democracy 525 candidates are commonly available, and the freeman's modest privilege is to declare hopefully which one he wants and then to put up with the one he gets. (S£, p. 175) In addition to that, the vulnerability of millions of people to the contagion of public opinion - most clearly seen in the powerful sway of mass media presentations - becomes a standard for mass communications nowadays. Advertising, which uis the modern substitute for argument, its function is to make the worse appear the better article" (5£, p. 187), can be used or even abused and lead to the exposure of some vital liberty at the cost of the depravation of others. Then, the panorama of choices to satisfy the needs and aspirations is somehow regulated, not to say, manipulated. The Declaration of Independence - A Salad of Illusions It was the aspiration of the young America to declare outright that a particular people, with its specificity, its passions, its uniqueness, its ideals, and its ambitions cannot be imposed upon by foreign dominations17 thwarting its attempts to thrive. According to The Declaration of Independence^ it is "the consent of the governed" that secures the inalienable rights of a given nation and only a government that respects that has a legal and a moral mandate to represent the people. It was also understood very well that those who love their own country must not deviate from the sense of patriotism and from the sense of justice: independence should be had by all nations aspiring to assume "the separate and equal station" on earth, not only by some of them. Santayana offers a sort of natural, if not biological, interpretation of this political issue, that enables him to explain the various approaches towards such ideals as national independence amongst Americans. When individuals organized in a nation or a tribe are vital and strong enough to assure their detachment and to confirm their uniqueness, they break the restraints imposed on them from outside and try to establish their own home rules, and, after some time, if circumstances permit, to impose them on others. Thus, it may be presumed that the Founding Fathers' longing for vacant freedom, i.e. the rejection of external oppression and control, was followed by the will to realize their vital liberty, i.e. self-governing, and the cultivation of the American way. The Declaration was the articulation of these tendencies. When the Americans started to be strong enough to reject the cramping ties with Great Britain, they simply did it, justifying it by stating that they had a right to self-government. However, it was not long after that when the independence of other territories (Native Indians', Mexico, Texas, the Philippines) were taken by the Americans themselves and those other peoples' hopes for self-government and independence were politically ignored, morally rejected, and militarily stifled. The American ideal of national independence seemed not ideal enough to be promoted and secured amongst the</page><page sequence="14">526 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski US's neighbors, or these adjacent territories that could be easily annexed. At the same time as the annexation of the Philippines by U.S. President McKinley and his refusal to grant the Filipinos their right of independence in 1898, Santayana described The Declaration of Independence as aa piece of literature, a salad of illusions" (i, p. 404); this document covers, under the layer of rhetoric and eloquence, the real, natural factors that incline, precipitate, push, and stimulate the growth, dynamics, and - depending also upon the circumstances - the direction of the development of the nation. The "vices" or "injustice" of the British monarch, enumerated in The Declaration^ were not the factual causes but rather the excuses for the detachment; the factual cause was the strength of the newborn nation to decide about its presence and its future, the evidence for that being that the justice in the name of which the newly emerged body politic vindicated its self-assertion was not translated into fair treatment of others that, although militarily much weaker, wanted exactly the same as the newly born U.S. did, that is, their own independence. One may observe that since Americans have assumed hegemonic power in the international arena, the methods they use, at least in some cases, can be said to have taken on the style of divide and impera or, to use Santayana's crude words - while talking, among others, about this "cast-iron" document - , "they [Americans] summoned every man to become free in exactly their own fashion, or have his head cut ofP' (COUS, p. 218). If we look at the global scene of modern times, we can see that it is the United States that has practically established the criteria according to which vital liberties should be classified and arranged as well as some political orders rearranged in a number of countries, often without regard to their citizens' and governments' deepest wishes about such exertion. It is the U.S. that crushes some political systems (e.g. Iraq) and saves others, no less despotic (e.g. Saudi Arabia); it calls some of them evil (e.g. Iran) and makes others, no less tyrannical, friends (e.g. Uzbekistan), it isolates some communist regimes (e.g. Cuba) and fully cooperates with other communist regimes (e.g. former Yugoslavia, China), it disregards some military regimes (e.g. Burma) and supports others (e.g. Pakistan), it condemns injustice in some places (e.g. the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait) and tolerates exactly the same type of injustice in others (e.g. the Indonesian invasion of Timor), it supports the independence of some nations (e.g. former Soviet republics: Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia) and does nothing as regards analogous aspirations elsewhere (e.g. the Kurds, the Tibetans, and the Palestinians), it calls coup d'etats non-democratic and unacceptable in the civilized world, but it supports them financially and politically "when needed" (e.g. General Pinochet's Chile). In addition to that, U.S. presidents, elected by a portion of all American voters (lately even in doubtful circumstances in Florida) practically exert their powers, militarily, politically and/or economically upon the rest of the peoples around the globe, who, naturally, do not participate in American elections at all. Thus, the vital liberties of the residents of Warsaw, Baghdad, Nazareth, or Quito</page><page sequence="15">Vital Liberties in American Democracy 527 are very deeply affected, directly or indirectly, not only by, say, Floridians' political sentiments, but even by their (un)willingness to vote; the Floridians, in turn, might not have even heard of such exotic places, nor do they have to care, in any sense whatsoever, about any kind of political sentiment or kind of election in those distant lands. The problem of justice and democracy as executed by the American administration overseas is gaining its momentum as never before. Santayana concludes that American democracy is not an imperialistic system that crushes blindly all the countries around, like the innumerable regimes in the past; it has a rather "commercial and missionary quality, and is essentially an invitation to pull together - an invitation which many nations may be incapable of accepting or even of understanding, or which they may deeply scorn, because it involves a surrender of absolute liberty on their part" (COÍ75, p. 200-201). Lincoln's Ideals Undermined In the Gettysburg Address of 1863 Abraham Lincoln uttered his famous words on the "government of the people, by the people, for the people" that constitute one of the fundamental ideals about the relation between the governing and the governed in America. Santayana, however, undermines the very existence of government as a body that rules and dominates the sphere of the vital liberties within the area of the social, political, and cultural life. In Dominations and Powers we may read: It is more natural to say that a horse is useful to his rider than that the rider is useful to his horse; yet with a strange egotism, peoples ridden by governments talk of the uses the government may have for them rather than of the uses they have for their government. (£&gt;P, p. 325- 326) The assumption upon which this statement is based is that the government's main task is to protect, defend, and facilitate vital liberties, by minimizing the inevitable conflicts among the real agents of social life - that is, individuals - , harmonizing their coexistence, and assisting in dealing with hostile circumstances. The government's role, then, is to preserve disorder rather than impose order.18 Instead of exerting pressure upon society, and throwing a net of obligations and limitations upon its members it should arrange, stimulate, activate, encourage, and promote various kinds of vital forces by means of creating the propitious conditions for them, thus, making the government a benefactor and protector without being an oppressor. Santayana the individualist and the cosmopolitan does not see a particular need for governing institutions, and he appreciates more a variety of the spontaneously emerged unities, under the condition that their members are not abused or deviated, and the very existence of these bodies does not lead to social anarchy, destruction, and</page><page sequence="16">528 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski chaos - which, as has just been mentioned, is one of the main tasks of the government to prevent from taking place. Santayana is very skeptical about unconditionally accepting the practical implementation of a given policy of a given government because of his extraordinary sensitivity to the discrepant hierarchies of values that are passionately created and carefully cultivated by groups of individuals, too numerous and too different from each other to be peacefully covered by the umbrella of any state government.19 Democracy is not an end in itself but rather a means to an end, that is to a possibly full realization of the vital liberties; otherwise, it can mean domination over some vital liberties, perhaps including the ones that are as morally justified, intellectually tempting, and socially worthy as the others. Or democracy would turn out to lack moral superiority over other social systems whose purpose is to impose an arbitrary track, not to say, a dark tunnel for human development. That Santayana felt himself, at least sometimes while living so long in the United States, at the edge of a free life, we can know from his notes in which he confesses that he u was unfit to live under a free government, where other people voted as to what I should do" (/, p. 356). Santayana felt that the democracy that he witnessed in the United States was not the one that he had expected to see or had fancied as the ideal: prosperity- oriented lifestyle, ruthless instrumentalization of the aspects of human life, and the institutionalization of social existence - all this was unbearable for such a humanist and artistic philosopher. He became a critic of American democracy which, in the name of freedom, practically restricts a whole number of various forms of liberty, making it not of the people, by the people, nor even for the people, but rather of the some, by the some, and for the some - Lincoln's declaration becoming impotent rhetoric rather than a guideline. Who are those some} According to Santayana, the government, and the establishment in general, in America, is an emanation of the most suitable form for the commercial, mercantile, and materially expansive sort of individuals: The people that counted in Lincoln's world, and especially in his party, were self-made men like himself, and it was natural to assume that they knew their own interests and if left alone would spontaneously secure them. (DP, p. 426) It may be claimed that the term uself-made man" does not apply to those who think of self-creation by means of speculative thinking like Socrates, of liberal arts like de Montaigne, of a monastic life like Thomas Merton, or of impartial stoicism like Santayana - these are perfectly idle and superfluous types of self- made creatures in America, unless taxpayers or book selling authors. This position was, for example, clearly corroborated, as Santayana reports, by the governor of Massachusetts, Roger Wolcott, who without concealment detested</page><page sequence="17">Vital Liberties in American Democracy 529 the openness of the professors and literati as captious, supercilious, and unpatriotic (cf. I, p. 368-369). If, then - Santayana concludes elsewhere - "a man is born a poet or a mystic in America he simply starves, because what social life offers and presses upon him is offensive to him, and there is nothing else" ( JF, p. xxii); America can seem neither for them nor theirs. Let me add one more thing, one indicated by Santayana in many places in his writings. There is a very thin borderline, sometimes very difficult to catch at all, where a given policy is not done in the name of the governed any longer, but in the name of the interests of some groups or institutions, for instance, a political party, the political establishment, the military, big corporations, the mass media, etc. - all somehow connected with the people in power. A system of salaries, patronages, and prestige make the representatives become the professional politicians, that is, a group, not to say a caste, that lead a type of life that is to some degree detached, separated, and qualitatively different from the people they are to represent. In addition to that, the power of the biggest TV corporations, owned by a limited group of those having access to the governing elite, makes it possible to propagate the "required" ideas and shape the people's opinions on a bigger scale that ever before. The danger is that the institutions that are to serve people can easily turn into the institutions that make people subservient. Then, they hover over the heads of the people, as if the separate bodies that influence or control public life benefit most from its fruits. This division between the ideas of the people who have happened to be within the governing bodies and those who have chanced to be under them can lead, still further, to the question how much and to what degree the government is for the people outside of the establishment at all. Harvard - Illusions of Self-Government Harvard University occupies a special place in intellectual America, having from the beginning the leading position among the institutions of higher education; also its role in shaping American political and social life has been enormous. It is true that Harvard's government and its policy cannot be seen as a representative miniature of the whole Republic, because the government of Harvard University is sui generis and eludes any descriptive title invented for political societies.20 Nevertheless, it has been a place for the political education and for the training of social responsibility for a great number of young people, irrespective of their fields of study, who, entering public life, as if at a preparatory stage, learn its mechanisms and recognize their own roles in it. From this angle of view, each university, the more the one that gives the Presidents and Nobel Prize Winners, represents and manifests the ideals and the principles that cannot be drastically different from the ones that constitute the framework of the country's political system and its social order. Santayana, for decades bound with Harvard - first as a student and later as a professor - gives us some interesting remarks on the University in the light of vital liberties and democracy.</page><page sequence="18">530 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski While a student, Santayana had a traumatic experience there; namely, six of his friends, all having philosophic keenness and moral fiber, committed suicide not being able to stand the down-to-earth atmosphere of the emerging capitalism. Stickney, who was the one I knew best, could never, I am sure, have prospered in the American air. Although he was a Harvard man, he had been well taught privately first, then afterwards for many years studied in Paris. When he returned to Harvard to teach Greek, he was heroically determined to take the thing seriously, and to share enthusiastically the life of his country; but the instrument was far too delicate and sensitive for the work; his imaginative (yet exact) learning, his spiritual ardour, his remote allegiances (as for instance to Indian philosophy) could not have survived the terrible inertia and the more terrible momentum of his new environment. (GSAyp. 171-172) As an instructor and professor afterwards, Santayana's experiences were intellectually stressing and his philosophical development was far from free. The production of his first book on philosophy ( The Sense of Beauty) was imposed on him for the reason of the necessity of him becoming an expert in a defined discipline; his ancient and speculative type of philosophizing being treated as suspicious or ignored. Harvard's President and, at the same time, the then reformer of the University, Charles Eliot, was on the point of getting rid of the contemplative aesthete who, like ancient Greeks, cared more about the cultivation of his own mind than about his participation in the success of the University. President Eliot's accusations against Santayana were very telling: "He does not dig ditches, or lay bricks, or write school-books; his product is not of the ordinary useful, though humble, kind."21 The criterion of the professional teacher was now how many students enrolled in the course rather than their intellectual development; the wisdom, sophia, that is, the ideal of classical philosophy was ousted by the instrumental knowledge, techne, which was given the status of the serious field of intellectual activity and seen as a product to be sold. The philosopher, instead of being a master or a sage, had to become an expert on a given subject; the intellectuals en masse had to become the merchants of applied knowledge and the specialists in practical information, dependent upon the call of the clients, that is, the students (or rather their rich parents) and the donors. Perhaps this was the reason for the sarcastic comments about the narrowness and the bias of philosophical education in the U.S.; for example, speaking of the German education of his life-long friend, C. A. Strong, he mentioned that it included "that strict training in all subjects which was not to be</page><page sequence="19">Vital Liberties in American Democracy 531 expected in free America" (I, p. 240). Also in the sphere of Harvard's political and administrative life, his observations are far from enthusiastic. The faculty meetings, for instance, were for him an object lesson in "the futility of parliamentary institutions" (/, p. 396). It was so because of the impotence of the faculty body to direct themselves fully, both spiritually and materially, at the university, i.e. independently of the donors, sponsors, and, naturally, of their expectations or even their demands. In other words, the intellectual impartiality of the university - the prerogative coming from the original and essential meaning of the idea of universitas - was regulated by the free-market economy, as all the other commercial institutions in the country. This made Harvard - despite its social uniqueness, its declared liberty, its intellectual powers, and its spiritual meaning - in fact, just like an industry. For Santayana, the alleged independence of the University was an illusion: "If there was a vote, it revealed not the results of the debate, but the previous and settled sentiments of the voters" (I, p. 396). President Eliot's reforms strengthened the role of the University, instead of being an end in itself, even more as "service in the world of business" (7, p. 396), resulting in the common ignorance of the faculty as to what had gone before and what was beyond as regards business. The Harvard professors apparently gave up responsibility for promoting the values of beauty and truth as they saw it in the depths of their souls, in favor of those that were prevalent in the commercial society around. Moreover, they found an excuse and solace in "letting an anonymous and irresponsible majority be responsible for everything" (J, p. 397) - an approach not understood by Santayana whose mentality was deeply rooted in the aristocratic and classic model of society on the top of which there should be at least some space for the intelligentsia and their ideas. Perhaps this attitude made him disappointed with the elite in America and led him to the following conclusion that was boldly expressed in his "Marginal Notes on Civilization in the United States": Isn't democracy built on the experience and the conviction that superior people are dangerous, and that the instinct of the common people is a safer guide? (GS4,p.l65) A free and genuine engagement in speculative thinking was lacking among the Harvard thinkers and their tolerance became a sort of supermarket approach, the one just mentioned above - they being tolerant "as you are tolerant of all the kinds and sizes of shoes in a shop window" (I 392), which, in turn, could hardly provide the propitious intellectual conditions for liberty to thrive there. Instead of breaking through the surrounding conventionalities, the governing arrangements, and the most influential fashions, these were justified and thought as obvious while the rest, however ancient, however valuable, or however</page><page sequence="20">5 32 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski respected elsewhere, were disregarded, if not scorned. The role of the university, that is, a shrine for fully independent thought, that offers a panorama of valuable options to the public, failed to be fulfilled. Partial Tolerance in Religion and Morals "American life is a powerful solvent" (COC/5, p. 47) Santayana once wrote on the conditions that await immigrants from different backgrounds; their ability to cope, in America, with the things they were unable to do in their home countries, i.e. shaking off the yoke of their suffocating and oppressive traditions, was to him amazing. America, he continued, as uit stamps the immigrant, almost before he can speak English, with an unmistakable muscular tension, cheery self- confidence and habitual challenge in the voice and eyes, so it seems to neutralise every intellectual element, however tough and alien it may be, and to fuse it in the native good-will, complacency, thoughtlessness, and optimism" (CO175, p. 48). The adaptability into the commercial and democratic society made by those whose traditions are not commercial and not democratic in any sense whatsoever, is to him amazing. Considering the heritage that was especially close to his heart, that is, Catholicism, he writes that it is ancient, metaphysical, poetic, elaborate, ascetic, autocratic, and intolerant. It confronts the boastful natural man, such as the American is, with a thousand denials and menaces. Everything in American life is at the antipodes to such a system. Yet the American Catholic is entirely at peace. (...) It is wonderful how silently, amicably, and happily he lives in a community whose spirit is profoundly hostile to that of his religion. (COLtf, p. 47-48) He seems to suggest that the freedom of religion in America is guaranteed indeed, although it must be within the conditions imposed by the governing authorities and the moral climate prevailing in the country. Seeing these things from today's perspective, one can risk the opinion that, except for such groups as the Amish - a closed community without any influence upon the outside world whatsoever - religions are free within the limits prescribed not by these religions themselves but assigned to them externally; if these boundaries are trespassed (e. g. Mormons' polygamy), the believers are persecuted immediately as law-breakers and fiercely attacked as barbarians. To put it in other words, the freedom of religion in America is possible because, among many other reasons, religion no longer means what it used to mean in Europe, and as it still does in some Asian countries, especially in the Muslim ones: a separate and a unique way of life that includes political, economic, moral, and intellectual matters - everything incompatible with the ideals of a lay society, and even much more, a rival to it.</page><page sequence="21">Vital Liberties in American Democracy 533 The freedom of religion in the U.S. is possible, then, because the representatives and the followers of the religious movements, generally, respect the fundamental rules of democracy and accept the religious plurality, giving up their (or rather their forefathers) original fight for their own religious exclusiveness, their moral superiority, and their spiritual priority over others. This, however, makes them evolve from their distinct orthodoxies into more or less similar denominations, disinfected from their incompatibility to the conditions imposed by the lay and democratic society, or else under the threat of becoming a marginal sect. It is for these reasons that they have had to change their teachings on, for instance, the role of women, prosperity, divorces, sexual promiscuity, homosexuality, and many others. There is no place for those religions in America that want to keep fully their orthodox vital liberties, their origin traditions, incommensurable customs, and to extend their influence onto those segments of life which are to be controlled exclusively by the lay authorities; only within these frameworks, can tolerance toward religions take place in the United States. There is one more issue that cannot be neglected here, namely, the freedom to one's sexuality in America. I do not want to deliberate too much on the issue that has caused many controversies among Santayana's commentators, although if we look through all his writings it will turn out that only one remark on it can be found there. Many years later after he left America, talking about someone else's homosexuality, he said: "I think I must have been that way in my Harvard days - although I was unconscious of it at that time."22 Nevertheless, one can only imagine how - if really homosexual, at least passively - it was necessary, at that time to keep the secret at any cost. Let me give one example of how restrictive and oppressing the mood was at that time. After the publication of his first philosophical book {The Sense of Beauty) in which he suggested that artistic expression is somehow derivative from sexual instinct, one of the readers and reviewers, American psychologist and philosopher Christine Ladd Franklin, wrote a letter to Harvard's President, Charles Eliot, demanding that Santayana be thrown out of the university and prevented from giving classes to students: "it is hard enough to make headway against evil without throwing away ground already won"23 - she wrote. Fortunately for him, after a good opinion was given of his morality by the then Head of Harvard's Philosophy Department, William James, to President Eliot, the demand was rejected. We do not know if it was Santayana's skilful conspiracy or merely the absence of homosexual practices that saved his position years before he gave it up himself, at the peak of his Harvard career. Santayana Against James on Un/Happiness in America William James can be seen as one of the most eminent advocates of democracy in American thought; his curiosity for new phenomena, his respect for contrary schemes of life that people can and do enjoy, and his sensitivity to various attitudes towards the universe - all this seems to make him uniquely</page><page sequence="22">5 34 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski tolerant and understanding. Thus, in The Varieties of Religious Experience he is open to a panorama of religious testimonies in the conviction that everyone has a right to his/her religious convictions. In "The Moral Philosopher and The Moral Life" he warns us against the inevitable partisanship of our opinions and assertions. In "On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings" he is attentive to the values of diverse lifestyles, and the excellences that can be obtained in the types of life that we do not understand or the ones that we do not enjoy ourselves. In "What Makes a Life Significant" he notices that the dogmatization of our ideals may cause, and usually does, injustice and harm to those people who have other ideals, ones no less outstanding and beautiful than ours. In addition to that, he was strongly convinced that American democracy is a good means to an end, which is endemonia. The idea of democracy is, first, to get rid of as many as possible unnecessary and unjustified oppressions that some people impose on other people and, second, to facilitate those conditions that make humans thrive, realize their needs, satisfy their desires, and multiply their satisfactions. This melioration of the world can be done in the American democratic social system that combines, as no other social system before, individualism and pluralism at the same time, that is, a possibility for the development of human beings in a variety of ways. He took happiness as one of the genuine indications of how things work and what their real significance is. For these reasons, one may suppose, he must have been a close ally to whom Santayana should have referred on the issue of vital liberties in America. However, it was not the case. What makes them different? What is the bone of contention between them? Defining the principle of happiness as the "spontaneous life of any sort harmonized with circumstances" (SEy p. 70), Santayana entirely agrees that the external conditions to be happy are apparently much better in America than any other place in the world but, surprisingly, this does not result in the happiness of Americans at all, the evidence being the cases of nervous depressions, insanity, and suicides, the number of which does not seem to be lower than elsewhere. Thinking about the factual causes for that, he has two main factors in his mind. First, he suggests that happiness in America has been ousted by achievement and, moreover, a happy life without a material success is odd in America. Second, he notices that work is the American proposal for a noble and a worthy life; it is work - rather than having a multigenerational family, a dedication to religious renunciation, a commitment to intellectual speculations, or practicing ascetism - that is the promoted type of activity and the remedy for a lack of the sense of life: "[d]idn't all my American friends endeavour, with a good conscience, to drown unhappiness in work?" (/, p. 421). Santayana fears that in the richest and freest country the prosperity of the citizens is hardly translated into their happiness directly and a free development of their vital liberties indirectly; instead they are doomed to suffer from "a forced enthusiasm, not really satisfying the heart and destined to end in emptiness" (IV, p. 6).</page><page sequence="23">Vital Liberties in American Democracy 535 The spirit of Jamesian intellectual openness and tolerance was shared in one of the oldest (founded in 1635) and best schools in America, namely the Boston Latin School which Santayana - like Benjamin Franklin and Ralph Waldo Emerson before - attended when a boy. His observations from there give us useful hints for a better understanding of the discomfort he felt while talking about happiness in America. There, the spirit of tolerance, melioration, and the act of aiming for a better future were accompanied by the lack of positive substance, satisfaction, and fulfillment, as if vacant freedom failed to have been followed by vital liberty. Santayana observes: You may say that for the teachers at least, in that age of individual initiative and open careers, a thousand alternatives were, or had been, possible; and you may say that they could not have been altogether insensible of their high vocation and the high vocation of their country, to create gradually and securely a better world, a world free from superstition, from needless hatreds, from unjust inequalities, and from devastating misery. Yes: but all that was negative; it consisted of things to be got rid of and avoided, and in America the more obvious of them had actually been escaped. Officially, especially now that slavery had been abolished, everything was all right. Everybody was free. Everybody was at work. Almost everybody could be well educated. Almost everybody was married. Therefore almost everybody was, or ought to be, perfectly happy. But were the teachers at the Latin School, perhaps the best of American schools, happy? (/, p. 151) The answer to this question is negative; neither the teachers nor the students were happy nor were they conscious of such ideals as great work, the glorious struggle of the American way and its eventual victory. Instead: They had heard of it; but in their daily lives they were conscious only of hard facts, meagerness, routine, petty commitments, and ideals too distant and vague to be worth mentioning. (I, p. 151) The same kinds of doubts was uttered about Santayana's teacher and, later, colleague at Harvard, William James; namely, although James had both a good character and the right conduct, his notion of happiness was "thin and barbarous" (COÍ/5, p. 85-86), meaning that James's thought does not include a radical pluralism of values at all; rather it is confined to those inevitably present in</page><page sequence="24">536 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski the commercial and mercantile mentality of Americans. James, according to Santayana, was against various forms of dominations rather than for the exposition of variegation of natural energies, powers, and potentialities. For instance, he excludes (especially in The Varieties of Religious Experience) a priori those "morbid" religions and "moribund" traditions that are not compatible with his notion of "healthy-mindedness", the one whose essential meaning dovetails with the common understanding of this term in America, although absolutely unacceptable in any orthodox country. According to Santayana's observations, such fundamental factors of a happy life as friendship and love, have been somehow stifled or pushed aside in the common practice of American life. Friendship, understood as a "union of one whole man with another whole man" (SE, p. 55-56), was ousted by cooperation or business partnership. Love has been institutionalized and smothered "by earlier vows, by age, sex, class, race, religion, blood relationship, and even fictitious relationship; bounds of which the impertinent Eros himself knows nothing" (SE, p. 184). If, then, one agrees, that happiness and self-fulfillment should be achieved by the realization of one's vital liberty, so the predicament when its growth is channeled into the pre-established direction can lead to the automatization of the agent's everyday life rather than to its spontaneous animation and authentic happiness. Santayana's concern about the commercial uniformization of values and standards makes him constantly return to the topics of "[t]error, and uneasiness of being oneself (POML, p. 259) and "the tragedy of those who do as they wish, but do not get what they want" (£&gt;L, p. 93). He does realize the fact that when thè freedom to choose one's own way is confined to a narrow set of options within definite frameworks, those people who do not adapt to the model, in the name of their own types of vital liberties can become frustrated and their efforts abortive. The necessity to adjust oneself to the mainstream values and standards can result in the artificiality of public life, happiness being ousted by the success in matching the requirements set up by the system of the prevailing domination. Weaknesses in Santayanays View Reading Santayana one may wonder whether any kind of social progress is to be looked for at all; indeed, even slaves, like Epictetus, can live happier and even better than their masters. I think that it is the wisdom by means of which it is possible to define the role and place of particular individuals, with their particular traditions, their philosophies of life, and their habits, that is the main subject of Santayana's attention. This is why he concentrated upon the inner man rather than upon the endless improvement of external conditions; "God - I mean the sum of possible good - is immutable; to make our peace with him it is we, not he, that must change" (SE, p. 102). On the other hand, he does not recognize fully the fact that material progress does contribute to a better or fuller realization of the vital liberties. The achievements of medicine, mass</page><page sequence="25">Vital Liberties in American Democracy 537 communication, transportation, public service, and many others - of which the U.S. is in the leading position - activate innumerable potentialities and initiate new capacities among greater and greater numbers of people, who, in many cases (e.g. refugees from underdeveloped countries), could not have even known of their existence and their applicability a short time ago. I suppose he would be ready to admit today without qualification that TV, for instance, must not be reduced only to the commercial presentations but it should be associated more with a possibility for the rapid reaction to injustice and corruption; that car manufacturing does not mean only luxurious limos but the production of life- saving ambulances; that the Internet is not just for watching adult pictures but it means predominantly a better source of information and more efficient communication between people. One may wonder what Santayana would say to the up-to-date effects of the economic development of the place that was very close to his heart, that is, academia. The colossal progress of institutions of higher education in the United States has made them the best equipped centers for intellectual life and international cooperation, as well as making America herself the country with the widest access to education of any country in the world. One may notice that the commercialization of American universities and colleges makes them offer a much greater panorama of choices than elsewhere, better scholarship, and a more fruitful realization of research projects - all this attracts thousands of scholars from around the world. It should not be forgotten that Santayana himself was able to cherish his intellectual independence due to the good business done by his relations in America (more precisely: by means of skillfully investing his money) and due to the money he got from his books, published and sold mainly in the United States. It is amazing to see nowadays how much technological advancement, especially the Internet, can be used in the preservation, propagation, and the cultivation of traditions, languages, convictions, customs, arts, texts - including Santayana's works - throughout the world. Economic development of a given country - a type of vital liberty itself - can, then, stimulate vital liberties, and it is wonderful to see (and benefit from) the American tradition, where rich people launch foundations, schools, and libraries, which could not exist otherwise. I have not the intention to develop this topic but let me just join the innumerable voices indicating the obvious fact that modern America cannot be criticized without limit in respect of her devotion to business and material progress. If we look at the U.S. we cannot ignore the widening place for various groups, especially that Santayana does not refer to any other modern country in which there is more room for vital liberties.24 It was one hundred years ago when women started to be treated equally with men and now they enjoy the same rights. In the sixties the emancipation of religious groups in public life was manifested by the election of a Catholic as President of the United States of America. The following decades witnessed the end of racial segregation; blacks</page><page sequence="26">538 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski now have access to the highest positions in the American administration. Lately, homosexuals have been given rights which have largely ended same-sex relationship discrimination. The social phenomenon called the "melting pot" seems to have been rejected and many Americans are proud of their original roots, even when they do not speak the languages of their forefathers. These tendencies show how different today's America is and how promising and attractive for many people abroad she is, especially for those who do not have such opportunities in their native countries. This also shows the dynamic changes in America that, happily, did not escape Santayana's attention and admiration. There are places in his writings where he openly admits that America is the freest country in the real world and not in the imagination - first of all because of her dynamism, youth, and vivacity. Nevertheless, American life is free as a whole, because it is so mobile, because every atom that swims in it has a momentum of its own which is felt and respected throughout the mass, like the weight of an atom in the solar system, even if the deflection it may cause is infinitesimal. (COC75, p. 211) It is this mobility toward the direction that he saw as propitious, welcome, and desirable that made him see American optimistically, in spite of all his criticism and qualifications. The moral and intellectual atmosphere everywhere in the United States seemed to be uniform: earnest, meagre, vague, scattered, and hopeful . After I left America, however, I gather that a sharp change occurred, introducing more variety, more boldness, and greater achievements. (7, p. 411) Conclusion For some Santayana may seem an aristocrat who is disappointed with the disappearing beauties of the classic era, a sage missing a group of Socrateses around, a poet whose poetry is commonly ignored, an egoist who builds his philosophy on his personal preferences or a snob neglecting the fate of the millions of immigrants, some from his native Spain, who came to the New Land to live in dignity, to have jobs, and to enjoy peaceful weekends - still, I suspect, a luxury for the majority of the people living on this planet. He also can be said to have reduced the idea of democracy to an idea about commercial liberalism, and ignored a variety of other philosophical and spiritual concepts widely recognized in America, (R. W. Emerson's self-reliance), and failed to understand that the powerfulness and greatness of this country, which he admired, could</page><page sequence="27">Vital Liberties in American Democracy 5 39 have been made only by hard, risky, and challenging work; speculation would not have sufficed. However, one can look at him differently. Despite the fact that Santayana left America forever in 1912, many of his reflections and observations have an enormous validity even today. He highlights the restrictions of liberty in America, he makes us sensitive to how differently it can be perceived overseas, he warns us against the dangers of the confrontation between clashing cultures and traditions, and he pays attention to the responsibility required of an individual, he sets a social melioration not by an endless accumulation of money and by an uncontrollable development of the social institutions but rather by the liberal arts, self-knowledge, and reflection - and this is his main contribution. Characteristically, Santayana's philosophical writing was devoted to many top intellectuals with the traditions and the systems of values they represent: Socrates, Lucretius, Plotinus, Dante, Goethe, Spinoza, and it is by such a lens that he perceived society. Such singleness or distinctiveness, I think, was for him the type of individuality he admired himself and he was afraid that this could be forgotten, marginalized or dissolved in American democracy. I suppose he had expected that the U.S., the richest nation, where the material conditions facilitate the development of the liberal arts in all directions, should be the hatchery of still more eminent personages that would be widely appreciated or even admired, rather than of business people multiplying their riches, of which they have enough anyway, or money making entertainers. However, Santayana is reasonable and disillusioned enough not to forget that reality makes us abandon the ideals of vital liberty for all. Certainly, absolute freedom would be more beautiful if we were birds or poets. (COL/5, p. 232) Opole University, Poland skris69@yahoo.com NOTES 1. G.

Although Santayana prefers the term vital liberty in the singular form, I will use it also in the plural to emphasize the variegation and the multidirectional character of the potentialities within a given body or a given entity. 6.
