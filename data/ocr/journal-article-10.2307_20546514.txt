<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Meadow of Artemis and the Character of the Euripidean Hippolytus * Douglas L. Cairns This article deals with the character of the Euripidean Hippoly tus-, to some extent this will involve the normal (and perfectly legiti mate) business of evaluating what the character says, does, and suf fers, and what other characters say about him. But I shall also contend that the speech in which Hippolytus dedicates his garland to Artemis (Hippolytus 73-87) performs the function of characterization in a rather different way, by locating Hippolytus in a particular cultural milieu as a sociocultural constructi. This is less a matter of the poet's suggesting that Hippolytus is who he is because of his history as an in dividual in society, than of his characterizing (or categorizing) him by symbol and association, in a technique which one might almost call characterization through metaphor 2. Under the orthodox view of the character of Hippolytus, the speech in which he dedicates his garland manifests all the signs of an unbalanced personality 3. But Hippolytus has always had his defend * An early version of this article was presented at the conference, Greek Drama II, Christchurch NZ, February 1992. The final version was written in summer 1994 at the Seminar f?r klassische Philologie, G?ttingen; I am grateful to the Alexander von Hum boldt-Stiftung (Bonn) and to Professor Dr C. J. Classen (G?ttingen) for their support. 1 This is not to say that you and I are not also sociocultural constructs - we are. But the difference between us and the Hippolytus who is characterized by the meadow speech is that for us the social and cultural systems in which we have grown up have been filtered through the experiences of an individual personality in such a way that, in so far as they are traceable as traits of character, they are traits of our character as individuals. 2 For some interesting remarks on forms of/possibilities for characterization in a "world of metaphor", see J. Gould, 'Dramatic Character and "Human Intelligibility" in Greek Tragedy', Proc. Cambridge Philol. Soc. 24, 1978, pp. 43-67. 3 The orthodox view is familiar to all from the edition of W. S. Barrett, Oxford 1964; see his n. on 79-81 and, for the essence of this approach (Hipp.'s unusualness, his puritanical repression), cf. (e.g.) C. P. Segal, Interpreting Greek Tragedy, Ithaca 1986,</page><page sequence="2">52 D. L. Cairns ers, and in recent years the defence has consistently maintained that obvious facts about Greek literature, culture, and religion make it cer tain that the orthodox view is anachronistic and false. M. Heath, for example, in a discussion of the relevance of a character's moral quali ties in determining the emotional engagement of the audience, claims not only that Hippolytus is "morally blameless", but also that "noth ing in [his] behaviour is so presented as to mitigate an audience's sympathies" *. From another angle B. Vickers argues that "the Greeks of the fifth century would ...have regarded Hippolytus' cpurity' as ...a perfectly normal consequence of the cult to which he had dedi cated himself" D; while for E. Segal Hippolytus, far from being "un balanced", is like many normal young men, then as now, who "love sport to the exclusion of all else" 6. But the most thorough recent de fence of Hippolytus is Kovacs's - those who find negative or problem atic elements in the characterization of Hippolytus, and who therefore, in Kovacs's critical terminology, "patronize" or "hate" him, do so be pp. 165-221 (= The Tragedy of the Hippoiytus: The Waters of Ocean and the Untou ched Meadow', Harv.

The above evaluations make more or less explicit use of psychoanalytic categories; but the broad outlines of their approach are older than the fashion for Freud; see U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Euripides Hippolytos.

Heath is, however, wil ling to convict Hipp, of "imprudence', and in a way he is right that Hipp, s fault is more like imprudence than vice; but we part company on the scale of the "imprudence" and the extent to which it (a) ranks as an offence in terms of Greek values and (b) belongs with indications of anomaly which will have proved deeply disconcerting to the original audience. ?

I want to oppose these views by arguing precisely the opposite - that there are facts about Greek literature, culture, and religion which show that the Hippolytus of the meadow passage is, after all, a prob lematic character. This seems to me the obvious import of the text, both here and elsewhere in the play, but signs of anomaly and danger also exist at a deeper level in the conceptual fabric of this opening speech. It is not that I want to privilege these deeper indications over the surface meaning of text and action; my point is simply that the surface indications of strangeness and danger are matched and ex tended by important dissonances set up by the location of the meadow speech in a particular cultural background. In strong contrast to the wholly positive judgement of a Vickers or a Kovacs stands the view of Hippolytus' character enunciated by his father: in the eyes of Theseus (in his denunciation at w. 948-957) Hippolytus' virtue was just a sham - in spite of his claims to be peris sos (v. 948), in spite of the eccentric posturings which Theseus affects to regard as those of an Orphic or Pythagorean (w. 952-954), Hip polytus is a base adulterer, a traitor to his philoi. The point about these lines is not that they give us the last word on Hippolytus' charac ter (obviously they do not), but that they recall in explicit terms the first speech Hippolytus makes in the play. Hippolytus did claim to be exceptional (v. 948, cf. v. 84), did stress his ability to "consort" (xyneinai) with the goddess (v. 949, cf. v. 85), did credit himself with sophrosyne (v. 949, cf. v. 80) 8, and did see himself, like the meadow from which he gathered the material for his garland, as akeratos (v. 949, cf. w. 73, 76) 9. Hippolytus, in his turn, is made to make these points again, himself drawing on the terminology of the meadow speech, at w. 993-1007: there is no man more sophron (by birth, ysya?, v. 995, also v. 1007, cf. w. 79-80), for he understands euse beia (v. 996, cf. v. 83), associates with those who possess aidos (v. 998, cf. v. 78), not with kakoi (w. 996-1001, cf. v. 81) 10.

Segal, Interpreting Greek Tragedy (n. 3), p. 172. 10 The elements of eusebeia and sophrosyne are rehearsed once more in the lament at w. 1364-1369.</page><page sequence="4">54 D. L. Cairns acterization set up by the meadow speech is clearly an issue in the agon between Theseus and Hippolytus. But of course Theseus is wrong about his son: his virtues are not superficial but deeply rooted, and his character is such as to make the crime of which he is accused unthinkable; perhaps, then, we are to recall the meadow speech at these points precisely in order to appreciate how wide of the mark Theseus really is - the traits of character that he despises as signs of eccentricity, it might be argued, have already been used to establish Hippolytus' nobility in the eyes of the audience, and it is this positive impression that Hippolytus recalls in his own allusions to the meadow speech. But it remains possible that Theseus seizes on aspects of Hip polytus' character which the audience will also have found problem atic when first introduced to them. What is clear is that the speech which Hippolytus makes in dedication of his garland is a significant one, one that an audience can be expected to remember and reflect upon at later points of the play. Let us begin with sophrosyne (and aidos, with which it is closely associated); Hippolytus claims sophrosyne "in all respects forever" (v. 80), but it is clear that the primary reference of the quality in the meadow passage is to chastity n. Sophrosyne is the woman's virtue par excellence 12, and in the context of women's conduct its sexual sense is inevitably to the fore, for, as the chorus of I.A. observe, the central imperative of women's arete (to which aidos and sophrosyne contribute) is resistance to illicit sexual activity, whereas the excel lence of men can take countless forms and is exercised in the public arena of civic affairs (I.A. 558-572) 13. So the use of sophrosyne and 11 On the partiality of Hipp.'s sophrosyne, see A. K?hnken, 'G?tterrahmen und menschliches Handeln in Euripides' Hippolytos\ Hermes 100, 1972, pp. 186-187; A. Schmitt, 'Zur Charakterdarstellung des Hippolytos im "Hippolytos" von Euripides', W?rzb. Jahrb. Altertumswiss. 3,1977, pp. 17-42; C. Gill, 'The Articulation of the Self in Euripides' Hippoiytus, in A. Powell, ed., Euripides, Women and Sexuality, London 1990, pp. 76-107. On his aidos and his sophrosyne in general, cf. D. L. Cairns, Aldos: The Psychology and Ethics of Honour and Shame in Ancient Greek Literature. Oxford 1993, pp. 314-320. 12 See F. M. Cornford, 'Psychology and Social Structure in the Republic of Plato', Class. Quart. 6, 1912, p. 252 (with refs.); H. F. North, Sophrosyne, Ithaca 1966. pp. 1 n. 2, 21, 37, 71, 129, 252-253, 314. 13 When the chorus say that women's arete is manifested "in the sphere of concea led love" (w. 569-570) they are clearly referring to adultery, which it is the job of their arete to resist; I find the alternative interpretation of H. P. Foley, Ritual Irony, Ithaca 1985, p. 80, and W. Stockert, ed., Euripides, Iphigenie in Aulis II, Vienna 1992, pp. 367-368 (that the phrase refers to moderate and discreet love within marriage) highly implausible. As Stockert himself acknowledges, "In der Regel weisen Ktjjtqi? xpujrc? und ?hnliches auf den Bereich des Verbotenen (Hipp. 154; El. 922; Ion 1524)".</page><page sequence="5">The Meadow of Artemis 55 aidos in the context of chastity and sexual modesty might suggest women's behaviour more readily than men's, and there there is cer tainly something feminine about Hippolytus' use of these terms in building up a picture of his own devotion to Artemis. Hippolytus him self stresses the quasi-feminine aspect of his nature when he refers to his maiden soul (jtcxQd?vov o|wxt|v ?x v) in v. 1006 14. (Compare the words of Artemis at v. 1302 - Aphrodite is inimical to all those for whom partheneia is a pleasure 15; notice that uall those" is ooaioi [no generalizing masculine plural] ; parthenoi are female and it is females who take pleasure in their maidenhood) 16. These (later) concrete indications of quasi-feminity do suggest anomaly (and we should note that Hippolytus' reference to his maiden soul falls in that part of his defence which, as we saw, takes up The seus' reference back to the characteristics first adumbrated in the meadow passage). But possession of sophrosyne, even with this central reference to sexual chastity, does not in itself mean that Hippolytus is eccentrically effeminate. Sophrosyne is used of sexual continence in males; in adult men, however, it does not have the specific and central reference to sexual conduct that it does in women, for the sophrosyne of the adult male citizen is exercised over the desire for sexual pleasure in exactly the same way as over any other desire or impulse: i.e. as an aspect of the ability of the "man of honour" to be master of himself rather than slave to his desires17. So Hippolytus' Artemisian sophrosyne, the sophrosyne of sexual purity, is not quite the same as the sophrosyne which the citizen aner is (ideally) expected to manifest 14 For the phrase, cf. Jtaoftevi? ipvx$ (of the Proetids, re their opposition to mar riage and the cult of Hera) at Bacch. 11, 47-48 (with R. A. S.

But then as a masculine virtue sophrosyne is not typically that of the citizen warrior (his virtue is an dreia)-, the stage at which sophrosyne is the characteristic virtue of a male is that which precedes the transition to manhood 18; and here we find that it is quite normal for the youth to manifest a form of sophrosyne that is in a fundamental way analogous to that of women. The prototype is Telemachus in the Odyssey (e.g. 3, 24; 4, 158-160), whose bashfulness and timidity are described both as sophrosyne and as aidos. In his case no element of sexuality enters the context. But his shyness is a trait that he shares with women, and shyness of this sort is frequently combined in later literature with a form of modesty that is specifically sexual in content. A good example is Plato's Charmides, whose aidos in the company of potential erastai makes him an excel lent interlocutor on the subject of sophrosyne 19; modesty towards erastai is also the ideal offered by the Just Argument in Clouds (w. 973-980); and further representatives of the type of the sophron young man may be found in the Ion of Euripides' play 20, or in the Achilles of I.A. 21. Evidence for the appropriateness of sophrosyne in young men is relatively plentiful; the Athenians prized in their youth both general modesty of bearing and specific resistance to the advances of erastai, and took steps, both in law and in custom, to foster these 22. An exam ple of this was the provision, in the fourth century at least, of ten sophronistai, under the general control of one kosmetes, to oversee the sophrosyne of the ephebes23; and even if the institution of the 18 See Cornford (n. 12), pp. 252-258; M.

The problem lies in his attitude to his sophrosyne; for even where that quality is expected, it is not envisaged as total and perpet ual chastity. The sophrosyne of adults, both men and women, cannot connote total celibacy, because all normal adults are married 26; the sophrosyne of parthenoi, though involving total abstinence before marriage, must give way to sexual activity afterwards 27; and in the case of youths, there are indications that sophrosyne need not require total resistance to sexual advances - a boy can allegedly be sophron in giving in to his erastes, provided his submission is private, discreet, and not immediately forthcoming 28; this may be a strategy promoted by those who stand to gain, but one can nevertheless understand why the prohibition on sexual activity in youths might be felt as less rigor ous than that imposed on girls - an eromenos might risk his civic sta tus through promiscuity or the imputation of having sold his favours, but this is a danger which can be avoided through discretion and mod eration; whereas even the most discreet amatory adventure on the part 24 See H.

But in any case, even if total resistance to sexual advances is to be regarded as the ideal in young males, progression to a stage of sexual activity is once again the norm 29. This means that Hippolytus' determination to manifest sophrosyne uin all things forever" (v. 80), to end his life as he began it (v. 87) constitutes a problem; he is taking sophrosyne fur ther than it is normal to take it30. What age is Hippolytus? He calls himself an aner (w. 994, 1031), Aphrodite calls him a neanias (v. 43), and the Servant says he is neos (v. 114; cf. v. 1098: his homelikes are neoi); the terms are im precise 31, but their general sense is made clear by Aphrodite's com plaint that he "refuses bed and does not touch marriage" (v. 14; cf. w. 1040-1041: the contest of kourai to be his bride is ended by his ex ile). Hippolytus is old enough to marry, and so at least in his eigh teenth year; but since his refusal to marry has become a problem for Aphrodite, he is probably older, though how much we cannot say; most probably he is to be imagined as in his twenties. Thus he is no longer a pais, no longer even a meirakion, even though he maintains the resistance to sexual advances demanded of those age-groups. Rather he is at that age at which the sexual possibilities, for a contem 29 On the rarity of life-long chastity even as a requirement of cult, see Parker (n. 3), pp. 84-94; cf. S. D. Goldhill.

He is precisely at the point at which to tal sexual sophrosyne becomes a problem; the modesty enjoined on the virtuous meirakion is threatening to develop into lifelong celibacy, which is virtually unheard of, and Hippolytus carries the virtue of youth, in extreme form, into manhood. This must strike an Athenian audience as anomalous. The sophrosyne that Hippolytus takes to extremes was a desired quality in youths, especially in the context of their dealings with eras tai. But - and this brings us to another element of danger in Hippoly tus' speech - that same quality was also regarded as desirable by eras tai. The bashfulness of the pais and his modest rejection of the lover's advances made him a more attractive and more challenging quarry.

Hippolytus' sophrosyne thus marks him out as a potential re cipient of erotic attentions (primarily those of men, but as Dover points out35, women seem to have admired the same qualities in youths as did erastai); and so it is suggestive of the (in this case cata clysmic) approach of sexual desire we have been led to expect by Aphrodite's prologue 36. His reference to the very qualities which en 32 On the unlimited sexual possibilities open to young adult Athenians, see Dover, Greek Popular Morality (n. 17), p. 103; cf.

Dover, pp. 68-81; Halperin (n. 17), p. 35. 35 Greek Homosexuality (n. 17), pp. 69, 172. 36 Youthful sophrosyne, of course, also attracts erastai because it makes the chase more thrilling, and so Hippoiytus also bears comparison with the typical elegiac erome nos whose hard-heartedness makes the erastes"1 desire burn all the more fiercely (e.g. Thgn. 237-254, 1263-1266, 1295-1298, 1299-1304, 1319-1322, 1329-1334); esp. interesting in this connexion is Thgn. 1283-1294, where the boy playing hard to get is compared to Atalanta, who, though ripe, refused marriage. Playing hard to get can be attributed to conceit as well as to sophrosyne (e.g. PI. Lys. 205e-206a; Meno 76b); if Hipp, were perceived as a (highly untypical) conceited eromenos this would connect in</page><page sequence="10">60 D. L. Cairns tail both the absence of sexual desire in himself and his determination to remain impervious to that of others in itself suggests that he is a typical and likely target of others' eros. From consideration of Hippolytus' sophrosyne I conclude that there are two problems: (a) he takes an extreme view of a virtue nor mally commended and admired in those somewhat younger than him self, and prolongs his chastity beyond the normal cultural limit; and (b) he reveals the danger of his position as a potential recipient of erotic attentions. Let us develop these points, taking the second first. For Kovacs, the poetic beauty of the meadow passage is a sign that Hippolytus is an admirable and sympathetic character 37. But the density of poetic language and imagery goes far deeper than this, as has been shown by J. M. Bremer 38, using the exhaustive studies of A. triguingly with his semnotes (see below). On the power of the eromenos, cf. Golden (n. 18), pp. 315-316. 37 (n. 5), p. 35; cf. A. N. Michelini, Euripides and the Tragic Tradition, Madison 1987, p. 291 (though she is aware of the complexity of the meadow-imagery, as of the rare intensity of imagery in this, a non-lyric passage). On any account, the meadow is clearly symbolic, and I cannot understand why Schmitt (n. 11), p. 23 n. 27 takes issue with Barrett on this point - that the meadow can have Aidos as a gardner in itself in dicates symbolism, and that the various indicators of purity in the meadow ("undefile d" [w. 73, 76], the bee [v. 77], personified Aidos, running water [v. 78]) parallel the purity of Hipp, is made quite clear by the reference to the meadow's accessibility only to those who possess sophrosyne by nature (w. 79-81). (For what seem to me to be strained interpretations of the meadow's symbols, see J. Pigeaud, 'Euripide et la co naissance de soi', Et. class. 44, 1976, pp. 3-7). On the purity of the bee, see A. B. Cook, 'The Bee in Mythology*, Journ. Hell. Stud. 15, 1895, pp. 1-24; H. Lloyd-Jones, Females of the Species, London 1975, pp. 84, 86 (on Sem. 7, 83 and 90-91); M. D? tienne, The Gardens of Adonis, Eng. trans. Sussex 1977, pp. 79-81; id., 'The Myth of "Honeyed Orpheus ', in R. L. Gordon, ed., Myth, Religion and Society, Cambridge 1981, pp. 95-109; A. P. Burnett, Three Archaic Poets, London 1983, p. 57 n. 11; Par ker (n. 3), pp. 77-78, 83, 95, 101. It is often pointed out that the bee will appear later in the play (w. 563-564) in association with Aphrodite (B. M. W. Knox, Word and Action, Baltimore 1979, p. 226 [orig. pub. 1952]; B. D. Frischer. 'Concordia Discors and Characterization in Euripides' Hippoiytus", Gr. Rom. Byz. Stud. 11, 1970, p. 89; Rankin [n. 3], p. 85; Segal. Interpreting Greek Tragedy [n. 3], pp. 172, 173; Burnett [n. 30], p. 171); perhaps this might just prompt an extraordinarily attentive spectator to revise his initial response to the use of the symbol in the meadow-passage, but it cannot be used to suggest that the presence of the motif in that place might even on first hearing have been perceived as a note of dissonance (Burnett's reference [p. 182 n. 39] to Ar. Eccl. 973 certainly does not prove that the bee was associated with Aphrodite/Eros, for there the association is with the Muse [see Ussher's n. on vv. 973a-975, and cf. n. 55 below]). 38 'The Meadow of Love and Two Passages in Euripides' Hippoiytus \ Mnemosyne 28. 1975, pp. 268-280.

Motte demonstrates, with enough evidence to convince even the most sceptical reader "*?, that leimones and kepoi are persistent erotic images in Greek literature, and Bremer uses his work to relate the Hippolytus to three fragments of Archaic poetry (Sappho 2 V.; Ibycus 286 PMG-, Archilochus 196a West2) 4l. Another excellent illus tration of the theme would be Plato's Phaedrus, in which the location of the dialogue, a lush precinct of Achelous and the nymphs by the banks of the Ilissus, profoundly influences the form and content of the discussion of eros 42. But the closest parallel to the Hippolytus passage is Ibycus 286; Ibycus' uCydonian apples" (quinces) are watered by river water (cf. Hipp. 78), in the undefiled (akeratos, cf. Hipp. 73, 76) garden of the Maidens (cf. Aidos as gardener, Hipp. 78). The re semblance in language and detail is striking 44, and it is hard to imag ine that Euripides does not have this specific poem in mind.

L. Cairns basing Hippoiytus' speech so closely on the language of one previous exploitation of the erotic associations of the meadow Euripides is forc ing his audience to place it firmly in an erotic context. But even if not, the passage still draws on the poetic symbolism of the meadow as il lustrated in the Ibycus fragment and elsewhere. The Hippoiytus pas sage is like the Ibycus fragment in portraying the meadow/garden as inviolate and pure; but this purity is a facet of the growth to maturity - Ibycus' garden, as is normal in poetry, is a place of exuberant fertility; its flowers and fruits are growing to maturity, soon to be plucked. The juxtaposition of the ripening of the fruits in the garden and the violent effects of eros and Kypris is certainly not (as Bowra argued) 4o in tended to contrast the seasonal and appropriate growth of passion in the young with the perpetual arousal of the older poet, but rather sug gests that the result of the storm of passion which strikes the speaker will be the violation of the purity of the garden 46. Cf. Anacreon 417 PMG: the Thracian filly may now sport and play in the leimon, but will soon be tamed (w. 5-6) 4?; again the meadow is the symbol of sexual innocence about to be violated. Motte, indeed, has a tabular summary five pages in length which demonstrates that the meadow is virtually the obligatory locus of deflorations 48. Io 49 and Oreithyia D? are among those virgins abducted from or deflowered in meadows. Even more precisely, for a virgin to pick flowers in a meadow is dan 45 Greek Lyric Poetry, Oxford 19612, pp. 260-263. 46 Cf.

Hippolytus has not only been pre sent in the meadow, he has also picked its flowers to fashion a garland. It is clear that Hippolytus is being presented as a likely sex-object; the meadow's purity is also his purity, but its exuberant growth also sym bolizes his own ripeness 56, and the passage as a whole suggests not the lifelong purity he desires, but one which is inevitably ended by the sudden and violent onrush of another's sexual passion, by the coming of Aphrodite 57.

The meadow is also a place of danger in another sense - it is associated not only with sex and fertility/fecundity, but also with death 58. This as pect of the meadow, however, stands in no sharp antithesis to the asso ciation with life, sex, and fertility, but rather coexists with it as one part of the whole. Meadows are regularly set aside for worship ?9, and the presence of flowers for garlands and running water makes them a typical locus of sacrifice, a process in which life is affirmed in the face of death 60. This antisyzygy of life and death is exploited to particular effect in Euripides' Electra: at 777 ff. Aegisthus is standing in watered gardens, plucking sprigs of myrtle for a garland, as a preparation for a sacrifice to the Nymphs (associated with fertility and childbirth al ready at v. 626) 61, when Orestes arrives and makes him the sacrificial victim 62; the sinister aspect of the meadow as a place of death is high lighted by the contrast with life-affirming ritual and the fertility of the location. This coexistence of vitality and mortality in meadow/garden sym bolism is well documented by Motte 63, with reference to the mystery religions 64 and to eschatological myths in Plato and elsewhere. But we see something of the same order even in specifically erotic passages, involving the abduction and rape of maidens, for in these the rape is itself an act of great violence, something not far short of death, creat ing terror in the innocent, flower-gathering victim. With this belongs the persistent identification of sexual abduction (or marriage pre sented as abduction) and death 6o, most obviously in the myth of 58 See (e.g.) Em.

Hippolytus, innocent and oblivious (like Kore), has plucked the flowers of the meadow of Artemis, and this ominous detail reinforces our knowledge that he is to die as, in some sense, a victim of eros. This brings us back to the theme of marriage. We saw already that Hippolytus constitutes a problem of marriage 68, and that part of this problem was his determination to persist in the sophrosyne which is typical and recommended in those in the stage between puberty and manhood. He is thus a figure in transition who refuses to move on, and his devotion to Artemis, together with the symbolism of the meadow, is a central aspect of this. Just as the purity of the meadow is not asex ual, but rather the preservation of an untamed, exuberantly fertile natural space, so the chastity of Artemis, and of those who associate with her, is not sexlessness, but wild, untamed, inviolate sexuality 69. Artemis herself is the perpetual virgin, but those human beings, typi cally girls, who are her devotees are associated with Artemis now in order that their present wildness may contrast with their later tame ness, with their bending to the yoke of sexual activity 70.

L. Cairns Devotion to Artemis is part of the initiation complex 72; Hippoly tus is already problematic in that he has entered the liminal stage, the stage of danger, and does not wish to progress. He has made his offer ing to Artemis 73, but the aim of his dedication is not to obtain leave to be married, but rather that the goddess should allow him to end his life as he began. He may refer to himself as an aner, but by rejecting Aphrodite in favour of Artemis, by attempting to remain in the meadow of inviolate sexuality, he is refusing to become an aner in the full sense 74; if he is to meet the demands of his culture he must take his place as husband, father, head of an oikos 7o. This is problematic enough, but there is an even greater distur bance of the cultural pattern here; in myth, in tragedy, and no doubt in real life too, it is chiefly the girl, the parthenos, who rejects mar riage, for whom marriage looms large as a sudden and cataclysmic ir ruption of adulthood and sexuality 6.

Brommer, Theseus: Die Taten des griechischen Helden in der antiken Kunst und Literatur, Darmstadt 1982, p. 131, s.v. Frauen"; Sourvinou-Inwood [n. 51], pp. 59-65). and in Bacch. 17 (e.g.) he has to prove himself not only as a future warrior but as as a future lover/husband (C. P. Segal, The Myth of Bacchylides 17: Heroic Quest and Heroic Identity', ?ranos 11, 1979, pp. 23-37); cf. Jason in Pind. Pyth. 4 (C. P.

And at the level of ritual it is true that Artemis, with all she represents, is associated with the transitions of males as well as females 79. But the basic fact reflected in myth, ritual, and tragedy is that the circumstances in which a Greek girl grew to maturity tended to create problems of resistance to marriage 80. It is for the female that marriage is the central rite of passage, and it is for her that marriage marks the definitive transition to adult life - for the male marriage may be a sine qua non, but sexual activity, though im portant, is not as central to the conception of a man's function in soci ety as it is to that of the woman 81. And let us remember that rejection readily associated with girls than youths; cf.

Cairns of marriage is basic to Aphrodite's grudge against Hippoiytus - the problem of marriage is stated early in the prologue 82. If that were all, however, we might be content to see Hippoiytus' rejection of marriage, problematic though it is, simply as an example of a mythical/cultural pattern which, though exemplified more often in women, could none the less be exemplified by a man 83. But this is to ignore the aition which brings the play to a close 8^: the grave of Hippoiytus is henceforth to be the focus for the songs, the offerings, and the grief of girls making the transition to adulthood through mar riage 8o. The girls are to make the gestures appropriate to mourning 86, 82 This is the answer to Kovacs (n. 5), pp. 126-127 n. 13 and others (Heath [n. 4], pp. 52-54 is more circumspect and more accurate) who argue that the dangers of resi sting the forces of human sexuality are no part of the meaning of Eur.'s play, that Aphrodite is merely a powerful anthropomorphic deity to whom Hipp, has caused per sonal offence. True. Aphrodite is no mere symbol, but her demand for real acknowled gement of her sphere of influence (as opposed to purely ritual deference) shows that her status as personification of a powerful natural force is also to the fore (a status ackno wledged in passages such as w. 359-360. 443, 447-450, 555-564); this is not, however, mere metaphor or Euripidean G?tterkritik (E. R. Dodds, 'Euripides the Irrationalist', in The Ancient Concept of Progress, Oxford 1973, p. 87); x? cupoooiaia, after all, is eve ryday Greek for "sex". Cf.

In cultural terms, the norm is restored at the play's close, but in the dramatic economy of the play itself, the ritual (the norm for the future) is instituted as reso lution of the problem that Hippolytus represents. We can now see the extent of the dislocation in the cultural pattern that Hippolytus consti tutes; he is a problem not only in that he rejects marriage, but also in that he subverts the categories of the male and the female; his very pe culiarity is enshrined in his cult, his tomb venerated like those of dead maidens, but around this central reminder of the youth who behaved like a parthenos life goes on as normal; girls, with his example before them as a reminder of the possibilities of deviance, make the transition to womanhood 88. The meadow passage, then, presents dissonance on several levels: the social, as Hippolytus takes his sophrosyne too far, retaining his youthful femininity when he should be becoming a man; the poetic, as the erotic image of the meadow undercuts Hippolytus' determination to remain pure; and the religious/cultural/mythological, as Hippoly tus takes on the character of a maiden and subverts the process of ini tiation. I have treated these themes separately, but the separation is artificial, and the three complexes are all of a piece. So far we have situated the problem of Hippolytus in the cultural material from which the text of the meadow passage is woven. These factors will, I think, necessarily condition an audience's evaluation of Hippolytus as a character, but none is enough in itself to entail that the audience will react unsympathetically to him as an individual. We could leave the matter there, and observe that, on the basis of this characterization, a whole gamut of audience responses, from positive to negative, might be possible. But this would be a mistake, for part of the function of the meadow passage is to supply Hippolytus with a character which motivates his conduct in the play and conditions the responses both of other characters and of the external audience to that 87 Jeanmaire (n. 24), pp. 341-342; Barrett, p. 4 n. 3; J. M. Redfield, 'Notes on the Greek Wedding', Arethusa 15,1982, p. 191; Seaford (n. 65), p. 108; id. (n. 14), p. 124; Dowden (n. 14), pp. 2-4. 88 If the tomb of Hipp, represents the negative possibility of deviance in the cult at Trozen, then the songs of the maidens, commemorating not only Hipp., but also Ph.'s love (w. 1428-1430) reaffirm the norm that Aphrodite must be respected; cf. the asso ciation between Hipp, and Aphr. at both Athens (vv. 31-32) and Trozen (Barrett, p. 5).</page><page sequence="20">70 D. L. Cairns conduct. Thus we should consider how the problems embodied in the deeper levels of the meadow speech are matched by signs of negative characterization on the surface level of action, reaction, and evalua tion. We saw how Hippolytus drew the connexion between his own physis and the untouched purity of the meadow (w. 79-81); his phy sis, from which comes his innate sophrosyne, is contrasted with the plight of the kakoi, who presumably seek or pretend to learn or ac quire virtue. That these are aristocratic sentiments cannot be doubted; the contrast between innate and acquired capacity is a commonplace in the epinicio of Pindar, poetry for performance at aristocratic komoi which praises those with the wealth and leisure to compete in the Pan hellenic games 89; and the antithesis between those of inherited excel lence and the kakoi (however the terms agathos and kakos might be intended) is a typical ploy of the reactionary politics of the Theognid corpus, poetry again designed for the symposia of a leisured class 90. These shades of archaic poetry belong with the lyric colouring of the untouched meadow itself, and help set Hippolytus in a specific social background. Now, it would be crass to suggest that every indication of aristocratic background in tragedy contributes to negative characteri zation, but it is one of the most striking anachronisms of the genre that "good" aristo- or autocrats are made to espouse democratic virtues 91. Few members of the original audience will have entertained doubts about Hippolytus just because he is an aristocrat; but he is an aristo crat who regards the majority of humankind as kakoi, and this is hardly the ethos of the democratic polis. Hippolytus, in fact, rejects the polis 92; he refuses to play his part as an adult head of household, to be a citizen on equal terms with others, and prefers a select group of like-minded philoi to "the mob" (w. 983-989, cf. w. 997-1001; these remarks come precisely at the point where the qualities illus trated in the meadow passage are once again at issue); his ambitions extend to hope of victory in the Panhellenic games, but not to politics - he prefers to enjoy constant eutychia in the company of the "best of 89 See 01. 2. 86-88; 9. 100-103; Pyth. 8, 44-45; Nem. 1. 25-28; 3. 41-42. 90 See, above all, H.

N.b. that part of Aphr.'s grievance against Hipp, is that he alone of the politai of Trozen rejects her (v. 12).</page><page sequence="21">The Meadow of Artemis 71 friends" 93. This contrast between Hippoiytus and his fellows, a small group of aristoi who alone possess true excellence, and everyone else, the kakoi, recurs at crucial points in the drama; our negative reaction to this, I think, means that our feelings are not unambivalent when he is later suspected and accused of being kakos himself (w. 942, 945, 959, 1031, 1071, 1075, 1191) 94. This is a very common word, but the question of who the kakoi are and how we recognize them is an im portant theme (e.g. Phaedra at w. 428-430); and the persistent recur rence of the term in the evaluation of Hippoiytus' character must be thematic; Hippoiytus' horror at being considered kakos and Theseus' conviction that he is kakos remind us of the meadow speech, and though we know that Hippoiytus is innocent of rape, and even though we might not go so far as actually to see him as kakos, we do feel that there is an element of poetic justice in his being considered so. Of the several key terms of the meadow passage that are repeated throughout the play another is eusebeia. Hippoiytus' eusebeia is closely bound up with his worship of Artemis; and his claims to euse beia to a paramount degree are amply borne out by the testimony of the goddess herself at the play's close (w. 1339-1340 9o, w. 1417 1419): Hippoiytus is eusebes, at least towards his chosen deity, and we cannot convict him of any delusions about the closeness of his rela tionship with her 96. But Hippoiytus does not just comment objectively on the fact of his unique relationship with Artemis; he presents it in normative terms as a privilege he alone enjoys because he is innately sophron-, everyone else, everyone who has to acquire or learn sophrosyne (if such is possible in Hippoiytus' view) is kakos. Is it not 93 On Hipp.'s apragmosyne, cf. L. B. Carter, The Quiet Athenian, Oxford 1986, pp. 52-56, 70-71. 94 Cf. Segal, Interpreting Greek Tragedy (n. 3), p. 190; Schmitt (n. 11), p. 21; C. A. E. Luschnig, Time Holds the Mirror: A Study of Knowledge in Euripides' Hippolytus, Leiden 1988, p. 46 (though I doubt that Hipp, ever modifies his sophron/kakos polarity, * as Luschnig, p. 84, argues). 9d N.b. the antithesis eusebes/kakos in vv. 1339-1341; if the gods do regret the deaths of the eusebeis, but destroy the non-eusebeis/kakoi, then Aphr. has every reason for regarding Hipp, as kakos (and for regretting the future death of her favourite, vv. 1420-1422), for she subscribes to the same principle (w. 5-6). The point is that, in terms of the values which they both share, Aphr.'s punishment of her enemy's hybris is as legitimate as Artemis' defence of her favourites eusebeia. Hipp, s eusebeia is as par tial as his sophrosyne; he does not "know how to sebein the gods" (plural, v. 996), he is theoseptor (v. 1364) of one god alone. Greek polytheism (see n. 5 above) does not legiti mize Hipp.'s partial eusebeia; it reveals it to be imprudent and dangerous. 96 Heath (n. 4), p. 85; Kovacs (n. 5), p. 35 (cf. Class. Philol. 75, 1980, pp. 134 135); contrast K?hnken (n. 11), pp. 188-189.</page><page sequence="22">72 D. L. Cairns possible to conclude that along with Hippoiytus' worship of Artemis goes a somewhat too exalted view of himself? According to Kovacs, this line of argument is culturally inappro priate; the Greeks had no word for "smug", and would not have rec ognized the concept to which that term applies 9?. There is, however, the word semnos, which does connote self-importance or exaggerated self-respect. Kovacs denies that semnos could translate "smug", and thus dismisses the question of Hippoiytus' semnotes-, but this is just the fallacy of false alternatives - if Hippoiytus cannot be qualified by some adjective covering exactly the same semantic range as "smug", then there is no question of his being considered conceited or self-im portant. But even Hippoiytus accepts that anyone who is semnos is achtheinos (v. 94); and that he himself is semnos is clearly suggested by the exchange with the Servant (w. 88-120, esp. v. 93) . The Ser vant's concern springs directly from what he has heard in Hippoiytus' dedicatory speech, and focuses on the danger of his master's failure to accord Aphrodite the honour which she deserves, a failure which he represents as a lack of good sense (w. 105, 115, 119), but also as a breach of the rule that gods must be honoured (v. 107). Hippoiytus' "imprudence", then, cannot be separated from his refusual to honour a divinity; and refusal to honour a divinity is "wrong" not only be cause it entails disastrous consequences, but because divinities are by 97 (n. 5), pp. 24, 125 n. 4. 98 The Servant also emphasizes to Hipp, the semnotes of Aphr. herself (w. 99, 103), but this is no criticism of the goddess, nor any suggestion that Aphr. suffers from the same fault as Hipp., (a) because semnos is regularly pejorative of mortals, positive when applied to gods; and (b) because it is a central theme of the Servants speech that mortals and gods must not be judged by the same standards - gods must at all costs be respected, human beings must be deferential (not semnos) in the face of the majesty (true semnotes) of the gods. The traditional interpretation of v. 88 ("for it is the gods that one should call masters", so Barrett, ad loc.) is clearly right {pace M. L. West. Class. Rev. 15,1965, p. 156; 16.1966, pp. 274-275; Bull. Inst. Class. Stud. London 27. 1980, pp. 10-11; Kovacs [n. 5], pp. 128-129 n. 29), for it is answered by the Servants address to Aphr. ob? jto?jcei ?ouXoi? Xeyziv at w.115-117 (n.b. ??ojtoiva Kimoi, v. 117). The same point is made by the pointed ?ooxc?v in v. 4. and by the remarks on the greater wisdom of the gods and their capacity for syngnome at w. 117-120; an audience which has seen Aphr. in the prologue knows that the Servants hope is misplaced, and that the capacity for forgiveness is one of the ways in which gods do differ from mortals (all the more reason to be circumspect and avoid semnotes). That the Servant plays upon two senses of semnos (particularly when the distinction in sense between the divine and hu man applications is so familiar) does not make his argument confused, as Kovacs would have us believe (p. 37; cf. Class. Philol. 75, 1980, pp. 132-133), drawing the highly im plausible conclusion that the Servants confusion "testifies] unwittingly to the correc tness of his master's choice '. Cf. K?hnken (n. 11). 185-186, and, on the pejorative ap plication of semnos to mortals and their pretensions, cf. N. Loraux. L'invention d'Ath? nes. Paris 1981, pp. 324-328 (= Eng. trans. Cambridge Ma. 1986. pp. 319-322).</page><page sequence="23">The Meadow of Artemis 73 definition entitled to honour from mortals (and entitled to complain when that honour is not forthcoming). This is precisely the point made by Aphrodite in the prologue; the gods demand recognition of their su periority from mortals (w. 7-8), and Aphrodite, as any god would, re sents any mortal who "thinks big" against her (w. 5-6). For a man to imagine that he can withhold deference from a god is for him to adopt the misguided conceit that the constraints which apply to other mor tals do not apply to him; and this is "thinking big" (or, as the Nurse quite legitimately puts at at w. 474-476, hybris) . Hippoiytus' con ception of the unique privilege he enjoys in his worship of Artemis is justified by the facts; but as a result of the "more than mortal homi lia" (v. 19) he enjoys with one goddess, he feels able to dishonour an other. This entails the over-developed sense of oneself, one's claims, and one's good fortune that Aphrodite identifies as "thinking big" and which might legitimately be rephrased as hybris-, and the subjective side of hybris, the over-valuation of the self which entails an under valuation of others, might equally be described as semnotes. The con cern of the Servant focuses on precisely the qualities of Hippoiytus which so excite Aphrodite's resentment. But Hippoiytus' rejection of Aphrodite is only an aspect of his complete devotion to Artemis, a devotion in which he prides himself and through which he differentiates himself from the kakoi. This is the point: Hippoiytus, through his worship of Artemis, places himself at the centre of the universe and has little concern for anyone else; sem nos is, of course, cognate with sebas, and it is no accident that the pos sibility of Hippoiytus' being semnos is raised immediately after he has demonstrated and commented on his particular brand of eusebeia. His semnotes, in fact, is his eusebeia viewed negatively. And if we need confirmation of this, we only have to turn once more to Theseus' de nunciation, in which, as we have seen, the qualities of the meadow passage are central. To Hippoiytus' extraordinary wish for the ability to stand beside himself and witness his own tears (w. 1078-1079) 99 Contrast N. R. E. Fisher, Hybris, Warminster 1992, pp. 413-415, who claims that the Nurse's argument here involves a "persuasive definition'' of hybris; the argu ment that resisting an illicit passion is tantamount to dishonouring the goddess of sexual desire may be illegitimate, but the Nurse's equation of "seeking to be stronger than the gods" and hybris is perfectly justified in terms of the everyday understanding of the lat ter term as a way of exalting one's own claim to honour in the face of the legitimate claims of others; in the same way, the "thinking big" of which Aphr. accuses Hipp, is clearly, in her mind at least, hybris {pace Fisher, pp. 416-418); see D. L. Cairns, 'Hybris, Dishonour, and Thinking Big', Journ. Hell. Stud. 116, 1996, pp. 15-16; and, on Hipp.'s ?berheblichkeit, K?hnken (n. 11), pp. 184-189; this, as T. C. W. Stinton points out {Class. Quart. 25, 1975, pp. 247-248), is Hipp.'s hamartia.</page><page sequence="24">74 D. L. Cairns Theseus retorts, "Aye, you're better practised in worshipping yourself (oavxov... ae?etv) than in being just and pious towards your parents" (w. 1080-1081). Theseus' reply has the air of long familiarity with Hippoiytus' ways; it belongs with the same negative evaluation of the qualities set forth in the meadow speech that we considered earlier; Theseus not only sees the element of narcissism in Hippoiytus' bizarre wish, he relates it to his eusebeia, which he sees as entailing too much sebas for himself - precisely, semnotes 10?. If this is psychologizing, it is psychologizing in the very terms used in the play to adumbrate and comment upon the motivation of its characters. At this point in the play, then, the audience, in spite of its appre ciation of Hippoiytus' innocence, and thus in spite of the sympathy it is likely to feel for him in that situation 101, is reminded of the possibil ity of a negative construction of his character; when Theseus catego rizes Hippoiytus as an eccentric Orphic charlatan, when he comments on his son's sebas for himself, we recognize that these evaluations, though they belong with an unjust assessment of his guilt, nevertheless are not entirely without foundation in the character of Hippoiytus as presented so far 102. And, again, when Hippoiytus uses the key terms of the meadow passage as part of his rebuttal of the charges, in an allu sive contrast between his own character and that of Phaedra, although we get the point of the allusion and know that Hippoiytus is right, still we are reminded of the precious exclusivity of the meadow passage, and understand how Theseus can only be infuriated by a further, and apparently irrelevant, indication of his son's semnotes 103. This is one of these "heart versus head" conflicts that are so frequent in tragedy: we know Hippoiytus is innocent, and we are inclined to sympathize with him on that basis, but a certain antipathy has already been aroused, and our emotional response does not entirely align itself with our rational appreciation of the rights and wrongs of the situation.

Hippolytus is certainly not "perfectly" normal; the speech in which he dedicates his garland sets up problems of character on both deep and surface, cultural and individual levels which condi tion our response to him throughout the play.
