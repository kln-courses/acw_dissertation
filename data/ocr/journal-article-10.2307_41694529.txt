<plain_text><page sequence="1">DREAM, MYTH AND THE HINDU CONTEXT* By Sadashiv A. Dange [ Friends, Before I begin my address, allow me to express my thanks to the authorities of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute for inviting me to deliver this address, on the occasion of the Seventysecond Death Anniversary of Dr. Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar. I also pay my respects to the scholars who spoke on this occasion, earlier. ] Dreams : Nature and Formation Suppose I were to ask you, whether at this precise moment you are all in dream, or whether both you and I are awake, you may be surprised if I really mean what I ask. But, this is what exactly Plato had put in the mouth of Socrates in his interesting dialogue between Socrates and Theaetetus. Socrates said, " What proof could you give if anyone asks us now, at this present moment, whether we are asleep and our thoughts are a dream, or whether we are awake and talking to each other in a waking condition ? " Theaetetus, not knowing what exactly to say, said, " Probably we could both be dreaming 'V It is difficult tu say whether Socrates asked this puzzling question just in a whim ; but, looking to the general attitude of the great philosopher towards all humbug and the traditional beliefs of his time ( fourth century B. C. ), it appears that he was rubbing at certain belief he thought to be unwise ; or, may be, he was serious in believing that nothing in our tempo- ral experience was real, and that what we call life is as unreal as the dream. However, at his time, and even later, the cult of Aesculapius was very much in vogue. Aesculapius was a healer of bad dreams and also an interpreter of dreams in the eleventh century B. C., and by the fifth century B. C. he was already deified. In tbat century the first shrine to him was established in Athens, and by the second century B. C. there were already one hundred * R. G.

A myth gathered round Aescula- pius says that he was the son of Apollo. At his shrines rites for incubation and generation of dreams were practised to have desired dreams. He was also symbolized by a snake. Whether the remark of Socrates had anything to do with this tradition has to be a matter of gues$ ; but, it certainly indicates the general interest in dreams and a desire to understand their impli- cation. We may compare another example - that of the Chinese philosopher, Chang Tzu. It is said, that he dreamed once that he was a butterfly and he was quite pleased with this change. When he awoke, he gave a serious thou- ght to the dream. He asked himself, * Am I a man dreaming of a butterfly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am a man ? 3 Here, again, we have a case where the line between dream-experience and the waking state is very thin. This is the case with many thinkers, and philosophers, who believe that this world is only shadow of the Real, whose nature remains a mystery. The Hindu philosophers are no exception to this thought, and believe that the Brahma is alone the Truth, while the temporal world is not true ; it is unreal. On the other hand, the tribais believe that the personalities in the dream are real, which is the basis of the belief that the dead are not gone for ever ; that they visit us in dreams. In Greece a systematic study of dreams was done by Hippocratus ( fifth century B. C ), who also provided the first ever classification of dreams as : ( i ) Prophetic ; ( ii ) Diagnostic ; and ( iii ) Psychologically revealing. About the nature of a dream, Lucretius, the Latin poet ( First century B. C. ), suggested that dreams contain stationary images ; but, that they replace each other so rapidly that an illusion of mo- tion is created. But, in that case, it would have been difficult to see any coherence in any part of a dream. What he, probably, meant was that one segment of a dream does not have any continuity for a long time ; it mixes with another segment, which is from another image. Hence, dreams appear fantastic and away from real life. However, personal dreams recorded by certain modern analysts do show continuity in the segments themselves.4 And, it is common experience that dreams do reflect continuity and fuller epi- sodes, though of short duration. 2 James R.

In other words, they were stu* died and analysed to avert their bad influence. Artemidorus, a roaming Roman soothsayer, who wrote Oneirokritika (Interpretation of Dreams), and lived in the second century A. D., found clay-tablet records of dreams in the library of Ashurtaaipal, dating 3000 B. C In one of the earliest records he found that Gilgamesh had a bad dream. To know the implication of it, he consulted his mother. She told him about the impending appearance of Enkidu, who would be his enemy and turn out to be his friend, later.5 As is well known, Enkidu was the alter ego of Gi'gamesh ; but, a bad one. In real life, Gilgamesh was an unscrupulous king given to wantonness 8 In Mesopotamia, the influence of a bad dream was sought to be averted in the following manner. The person concerned took a lump of clay. He rub- bed it over his body, and addressed it as follows : " In your substance my- substance is now fused ". After this, the dreamer told the lump auout his dream. He then threw the lump into water with the chant, that all the bad influences of the dream should go to the water and disintegrate.7 The belief is, that the bad influences of the dream would contaminate the body and mind of the dreamer. By this method, they are transferred to the ball of clay, and in its being thrown into the water, the body and mind of the dreamer would be free from them. In a variant practice, the dream was told to a reed. It was then burnt to ashes and the ashes were blown off after gathering them Où' the palm.8 The idea in both these practices is that a dream, either good or bad, is not to bs told to any person ; because, one could not be quite sure if a dream is good or bid. In telling it, the person to whom it is told tnay be harmed, or may misuse it to harm the dreamer himself. Hence, there were special persons to whom a dream could bj told. These were beyond harm, as they had special power. One is reminded of a folk-talc from India, in this context. Though it does not concern any dream, it has the same motif. It is said, that a barber of a king knew that the latter had the ears of a donkey. The barber could hardly hold this interesting secret to himself ; but, he could also not tell it to anybody for fear of further divulsion, and the resultant punishment by the king. So, he went into the forest, and told it to a tree. 6 Anthony Stevens, Private Myths, Harvard Uni. Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1995, p. 8. 6 O. S.

When the drum was sounded, it said continuously, " O ! The king has donkey-ears ! ! " 9. The belief behind telling the dream to a clay-lump and destroying it should be clear. Ás we shall see later, the Vedic source attests the point that there were rites and incanta- tions for mitigating the probable influence of bad dreams.10 In ancient Egypt Serpis was the god of dreams, and many temples were dedicated to him. The most important of these was the one constructed at Memphis. In some of these temples there were professional dream-interpreters, who advertised them- selves as having god's mandate to interpret dreams. And, there were also hired dreamers on behalf of a person who could not personally arrive at the temple. In such cases, the dream was conveyed to the person by the drea- mer. Dreams also could be sent for being interpreted, by getting them written down on a piece of papyrus with an incantation. The write-up was then placed on the mouth of a mummy, or in the mouth of a dead cat.11 In modern times the analysis of dreams was used for clinical purposes, to investigate mental abnormalities and psychic problems. The most famous name in this regard is that of Sigmund Freud, who proposed that all dreams are wish-fulfilling. Among his other observations are : ( i ) Dreams indicate repressed desires ; ( ii ) Most repressed desires are infantile in origin ; ( iii ) Details in dreams, in many cases, relate also to the events of the previous day ; ( iv ) The function of the dream is to preserve sleep, by throwing off tormenting thoughts in the form of dream-images ; and ( v ) Dream images have close relation with sexual desires." The last of his observations was not universally accepted ; and, even in his time, there was a grave challenge to it, though he would twist his argument to prove his point of a sexual base for most of the dreams. His followers included such scholars as Otto Rank, Karl Abraham and others. Even this day, the influence of Freudian thought is to be seen when people see loud and boisterous festivities and cinema shows with high sexual note, together with scenes of crime, as an escape for supre- ssed desires.13 The spacious argument is that these relieve the internal pres- 9 From personal communication. 10 A V.

Another, equally famous scholar, who did not go hand in gloves with Freud, though he was the latter's follower for some time, is Karl Jung. The friend* ship of these two great men broke, after just seven years of endurance, at a discussion of the meaning of a dream, just after both were invited to deliver lectures at the Clark University Worcester, Massachusetts ( 1909 ).u Jung proposed that certain universal structures are present in the brain, that are common to all human experience. As these are not restricted to one indivi- dual, and are common to all men, passing through generations, they consti- tute what he called ' collective unconscious There are typical images, or archetypes, that constitute the collective unconscious. The idea of the struc- tures, typical images and archetypes, whicli Jung speaks of, appears to be akin to the Kantian Jconcept of categories through which our experience filters, on the one hand, and with the structures that Claude Levi Strauss speaks of in the context of the myths - a sort of ' bricolage J,15 wherein stiuclured ex- periences go to form myths. In this, the formation of myths and dreams undergoes a similar process. The concept of collective unconscious helps explain such dreams where the dreamer sees images which he has never ex- perienced in his life-time - at least he does not so remember. Jung suggests that such images are settled in the brain of the dreamer at an unconscious level, through the bygone ages ; they get released in dreams. One may not doubt the collective nature of the images from various levels of births in the same family ( through genes ? He does not say so ). But, it is natural for our eye-brows to get curved when he conne;ts the dnam-images of a person from Europe to the mystic symbols from another far off land, or when he speaks of the ' grand old man * of bygone ages showing himself in dreams - anywhere and everywhere. The same is true of his own dream at Worcester (1909), wherein he saw himself in three floors- the top floor with modern furniture, the middle floor with mediaeval things and the underground floor where he saw two skulls. He explains that the top floor reflects the personal conscious ; the middle floor the personal unconscious, while the underground level stands for the collective unconscious, the skulls standing for the ance- stors.16 If we accept this concept of collective unconscious, the ancient buil- dings and such other images of un-modern objects could be safely taken to be the result of long bygone memories reposing in the subconscious. But, is that 14 Anthony Stevens, op. cit. P. 51 where he refers to Memories, Dreams and Reflec- tions (of Jung), p. 155. 18 Clement J. C. Webb, A History of Philosophy, Thurston Butterworth Ltd., Lon- don, 1937 ( 1915 ), p. 192 ; Claude Lèvi Strauss, Mythologiques II, Paris, 1966, p. 22. 18 Anthony Stevens, op. cit. p. 52. 9 I Annals BORI )</page><page sequence="6">66 Annals BORI, LXXJX ( 1998 } so ? Or, could they be mix-ups of objects seen, and situations experienced in the person's own life-time, but since forgotten by the active memory and relegated to the unconscious ? Actually, this suggestion is attested by the Hindu tradition and is recorded in the Upanisads, as we shall see later. An important suggestion in connection with dreams was made by Francis Krick and Graeme Mitchison ( 1983 ), according to which dreams dump out redun- dant information. According to these scholars, a reverse process is in pro- gress in the REM ( Rapid Eye Movement ). The REM is the state when dreams get formed ; and in this state, according to these scholars, this reverse process is at work, which is opposite of learing. This is called 4 Reverse Learning '. Thus, we dream to forget.17 This is something like Freud's suggestion that dreams protect sleep, with the emendation that they do this by throwing out unwanted memories, or awkward desires. However, this is not the case. In many cases, the dreams give suggestive information, in a prophetic way, as in the case of the famous dream of Abraham Lincoln, wherein he saw the ' President's ' coffin being guarded by soldiers in the White House. This was a suggestion ; and he was later murdered. This may be compared with the dream of Caesar's wife which fore-told about his murder. In the Hindu context, this motif was used by the dramatist Bha{tanär3yaiia in his drama ( Vepísamhãra), where the wife of Duryodhana had a dream that a nakula ( ichneumon ) destroyed a group of a hundred serpents ( Act II). She construes it to be indicative of the killing of the hundred Kaurava brothers (who included Duryodhana) by Nakula, the son of PSgdu. Duryodhana ucder-rates the dream saying that dreams show many auspicious and inauspicious things, and they are not to be adhered to- Ultimately, Duryodhana is killed in the battle with Bhîma, the brother of Nakula. Other scholars are of the opinion that dreams do have meaning, and that some of them are of a prophetic nature. They are called ' prodomal * (from Gr. Prodomos, ' going ahead').18 William C. Dement,19 who coined the term REM, proposed that dreams have a great suggestive power. Clinical study of the process of dream has proved that, though dreams are formed during thi REM period, prior to that there is the Non-Rapid-Eye Movement ( NREM ), which itself is preceded by what is called the hypnagogic state. In the hypnagogic state images flicker before the eyes for a short duration and they are disconnected. The NREM state gives out short-duration diffused waves of sleep for a period of nintey minutes, initially. It is tnen intervened by the REM state ; and the sequence goes on, the later REM state being of 17 "The Function of Dream Sleep ", Nature, p. Ill if. 18 A. Stevens, op. ett-, p. 1». « ¡bid. p. 86.</page><page sequence="7">Dange i Ďream , Myth and the Hindu Context 61 longer durations. The latest REM state is longer still ; and, dreams thrown in it get to be remembered more clearly. Events get stored in the memory ; and dots and pieces of these events swim along during the NREM period only to vanish. According to J. Winson, essential information gathered dur- ing the day is reprocessed in the REM state.20 This constitutes the short- term memory of the events. But, such short-term events get fixed into long memory after a period of three years of occasional repetitinn.21 This repeti- tion occurs in dreams. Events thus fixed in the long-term memory show up in dreams even after a long lapse of time. These events, and other infor- mation needed for the survival of the species, stored in the long-term me- mory, constitute what is called the unconscious. They surface to the brain and show up images in the REM state of sleep, to form dreams. This obser- vation is apt to give us a fairly good picture of dream-formation, and would inform us that the unconscious is a store of innumerable images during a whole life-span. To read this observation with that of Jung, we have to belie- ve that an individual's unconscious goes beyond his own experiences and draws on those of the whole humanity, irrespective of the consideration of space and time. This is, rather, a very wide shot ! Even if one brings in here the belief in reincarnation, the events stored will be of the same indivi- dual's experience in former births, or, at the most, of his own family lineage. Even granting that reflections of events needed for the survival of the species are stored in the memory, it is difficult to believe that the dream of a person from Europe, who has had no chance of visiting India, would show a mystic symbol in his dream that is from the Hindu i tantric ' source. There is hardly any doubt about the fact that dreams do involve certain symbols. However, such symbols have to be from the social and religious context of the dreamer, or from his own experience if from a different context. This is not to say that common suggestive symbols do not occur in diverse societies. For exam- ple, a jar may be taken as a general symbol for the womb ; a knife may be taken as a general symbol for the male organ ; a tree may stand for growth or fortune and so on. Thus, a jar, filled with water seen in a dream is said to indicate the birth of a son according to the Hindu belief. Likewise, among the Aztecs, the first boy-girl couple was believed to have been produced from a jar ;aa and so on. 20 "Ths Meaning of Dreams", Scientific American , Nov. 1990, pp. 42-48. " Ibid .

Scholars have seen a close similarity between a myth and d**eam. Joseph Campbell said, that a myth is a public dream ; and that a dream is a private myth,23 Recently, Anthony Stevens authored a book on dreams with the title : Private Myths , with the sub-title - 'Dreams and Dreaming '( 1995, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts ). Earlier, at the begin- ning of this century, Otto Rank ( Myth of the Birth of the Hero , 1903; Eng. tr. 1913 ), said that a myth is the dream of the masses. And even Jung said that myth-makers thought in the same way as we think in dreams ( Symbols of Transformation , 1956 ( 1911 ) ). Whether we think in dream is doubtful, because, a dream is more perceptual than conceptual. However, there is a type of dream, termed « Lucid dream ',24 wherein a dream could be monitered; because, the dreamer knows he is dreaming. Methods practised by Tibetan lamas could create an artificial dream state, or mix the various dream states.15 But, these are to be taken as special and supranormal. The perceptional nature of a dream is a more common experience ; because, a dreamer has no control over his dream, and sees what is presented to him. It is this common type of dream, which is natural, that has certain characteristics of a myth. When Jung says that he does not dream, but that he is dreamt, he has the natural dream in mind. This is exactly similar to what Claude Lévi Strauss says about myths, that myths think themselves in the minds of men.ii6 The implication is that myths are not made ; they come through the tradition. There may be versions of the same proto-myth, which gets evolved in the tradition through ages.27 Likewise, a dreamer does not create a dream ; it gets created. In both, myth and dream, the unconscious is in the process. In a dream it is the uncons- 83 The Power of Myth ( Campbell's dialogues with Bill Moyers ; ed. by Betti Sue Flo- wers), New York, 1988, p, 40.

In the case of a myth, it is the unconscious of the society, or the tribe or the masses - known as the tradition - that has been at work. For Jung, in both cases it is the coll active unconscious. It is the collective unconscious ( if this concept is accepted, or we may simply say tradition ) that evolves symbols ; and, this may happen even in the case of an individual dreamer, where it would be not so much the tradition of the society as the pattern of dreams of that particular dreamer. If a person often dreams of missing a train, it may indicate apprehension about success in any field. Such fear, in any situation, may produce for hi&lt;n a missing train in his dream. But, the the missing train may not indicate the same in the case of another person. A circumstancial dream may indicate the same thing in the case of an indivi* dual, and become symbolic for him. Thus, a person dreaming of swimm- ing in a river, or a pool, may have a cold as an immediate sequence. It is these personal symbols or, better, patterns, that help diagnosis. We could say, that traditional patterns evolve into symbols; in an individual they remain patterns. A pattern, or symbol on the broader level, is suggestive of something other than itself. This is true of a dream as also of a myth. As in the subconscious of an individual a missing train, or swimming, is different from the thing it conveys, so a symbol set in a tradition is different from what it stands for. And, these symbols may be similar in different cultures, or may tally with one another. In the latter case, however, the probability of borrowal cannot be ruled out altogether. In the case of one of my informants ( I mean persons who informed me of their dreams, on my request ; I am not a psychiatrist, far less a clinical one ! ) he often dreamt of ants crawling in his hair ( in the head ) before he got fever. But, elsewhere, seeing of ants in the dream is interpreted as hard work and foresight.38 Another, of my informants, told me that, for a period, he had dreams of a crocodile and he felt uneasy in the dream. On observation, it came out that this was the case when he had tooth-ache or falling teeth, in actual experi- ence. This may be compared with the dream of king Ašoka in the account of his son, Kuijãla. According to it ( in short ), Ašoka was seriously ill. KuçSla's step-mother and the chief queen of Ašoka, named Tisyarak;it3, had a passion for Kunãla, but, the young boy did not accept her advances. So, she decided to do away with him. As a reward for her services and saving him from the dangerous illness, Ašoka had granted her supreme power for seven days. During this period she plotted to send KugSla with a letter to the people of TaksašilS to put out his eyes. She had that letter sealed, 88 James R. Lewis, op. cit. p. 269.</page><page sequence="10">% Annals BORI, LXXIX ( 1998 ) with great difficulty and guile, with the teeth of Ašoka, as was his usual practice for important letters. At Taksasilä, the order was obeyed ; and the eyes of Kunäta were taken out. When Ašoka used his teeth for sealing the letter, he had a dream that his teeth were loosened and were falling off. When he consulted his dreem-interpreters, they said that, if a person sees his teeth falling off, in a dream, it is indicative of the eyes of his son falling out and also of his death. The account, earlier, says that a Buddhist monk had predicted the destruction of Kanäla's eyes, and that was the reason for the boy to take to Buddhist studies and faith. Later Ašoka comes to know the trick of his wife, and puts her to death. The account connects the belief of falling teeth leading to destruction to the account of Kunäla. On the very face of it, the account is more of a myth than a dream, though it uses a dream symbol. The account, cloaked in a mythical garb, lessens the proba- bility of its being a dream. Actually, it seems to cover up a conspiracy hat- ched by Tisyaraksitã, probably, helped by Buddhistic monks, a possibility not noticed by Wendy O' Flaherty, who has mentioned and studied the account.29 How else can we understand the prophecy of a Buddhist monk, which exactly comes true. And, without doubt, the « prophecy ' was inser- ted in the account as a ploy for the propagation of Buddhism. Tûis would also indicate, if the prophecy is a historical fact, that soothsayers, with a religious bias, indulged in such prophecies playing on the beliefs and emo- tions of the common people. The falling of teeth is associated, along with other parts of the body, with the loss of a near one including that of a son.30 The falling of teeth in this dream may be compared with a belief elsewhere. According to it, if a woman sees her teeth falling off in her dream, it is indi- cative of her bearing a child in the near future. And, according to Freud, it is suggestive of adolescent self-ejection.31 This will show how the same symbol carries different meanings for different people. The employment of a common belief regarding dreams to myths, or mythical accounts, to add divine lustre to the birth of a renowned person ( more probably after his death ) is seen also in other accounts. For example, we are told that M Eyã, the mother of Gautama ( the Buddha, later ) had a dream indicating that an illustrious son would be born to her. She saw that her bed was transported by four celestial men to a high Himalayan peak. There she was bathed and adorned with jewels by four divine women. As she lay there, on the bed with her head to the east, all the men and women « W. O • Flaherty, 0p. cit . p. 35 f. 30 Ibid-, p. 21, where she refers to the Atharvaveda-parisista, ■* R&lt; L. Von De Castle, op* cit . pp. 335-339.</page><page sequence="11">Dange i Dream , Myth and the Hindu Context 71 vanished. She remained alone. Now, a small white elephant came down from above along the peak and softly piered her right side with his tusk and entered her stomach. And she realized that she was pregnant. The boy that was born was, later, to become the Buddha.32 If we take away the dream, the account becomes a perfect myth. The earliest mention of his motif of supernatural birth, but without the dream, occurs in the Rgveda ( IV. 18.2 ) where Indra is said to have been born from the side of his mother ; because he had grown so big in the womb of his mother that it was impossible for him to come out along the usual way. This myth indicates that, in the myth of the birth of the Buddha, the dream sequence was an addition in the period of the mythification of the Buddha. The dream-myth of Buddha's birth is an inversion of the myth of the birth of Indra, as in the latter myth there is no entry through the side, but the birth from the side of the mother. The idea in both is of supernatural birth. We may compare the case of Mary, the mother of Jasus Christ. Here also there is no dream, but just a faint sugges- tion of the conception through the ' Holy Spirit ' The dream is for Joseph ( father of Jesus ) in which the angel of the god tells him that he should accept Mary as wife, though she was already pregnant. This myth of the divine origin of the Christ was floated many years after the death of the Christ. Not even Paul knew it ; for, had he known it, he would have surely men- tioned it. The first reference to this supernatural birth occurs in the gospel ofMathew, written long after Jesus had died.*3 The point is, that some accounts recorded as dreams in the tradition can be converted to myth ; and one is not sure if they were dreams at all in the original accounts. Likewise, some mythical accounts can be taken as dreams, though not specifically so mentioned. Take, for example, the account of the birth of Karna. The myth tells us that Kunti got a mantra from the sage Durväsas ; she uttered it and the sun-god arrived on the scene and impregnated her. The son born from this union was Karna. This myth explains the conception of Kunti before her marriage, and gives Karna the status of a divine origin ( Mbh. Adi 67. 133ff. ; 1 1 0.6-20). If peoole could believe that a god could unite with a mortal woman, there would be no difficulty for them to believe also that the god impregnated her in her dream. But, the account does not use the ploy ®3 Cf, As'vaghosa, Buddhacaritam I. 20, where the incident is taken from the Jãtaka - Atthakathã ; also A. Tillard, Spiritual Dimensions , Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1961. Trisalã ( also called PriyakärinT ), the mother of Mahãvira, is said to have seen auspicious objects, prior to the bit th of Mahãvíra, in her dream. Among sixteen of such objects she saw are : a white elephant, a white bull, a white lion, Laksmi, the full moon etc. 38 Richard Sh?nkman, Legends , Li fes and Cherished Myths of World History , Harper Collins, New York, 1993, p. 21$.</page><page sequence="12">72 Annals BORI, LXXIX i 1998 ) of a dream. We have another account where the loving parties are said to unite in dream, though mutually unknown to each other. Later, they actu- ally get sexually united. It is the account of Usã and Aniruddha ( Bhãga - vata P. X. 62. 11 ff ). It is also said that Alexander's mother, Olympias, told bim that he was born to her from her union with a god ( in all likelihood, Zeus Ammon ).84 How this was done is not mentioned. But, in the case of his comrade-in-arms, Selucus, it is said that his mother, Laodice, slept in her dream with Apollo ; thus was Selucus born.S5 Such supra-normal ( or, ab- normal ! ) things happen in dreams ; and they are also chracteristic with myth as seen in a number of cases. In both the real meaning, or message, or content, lies under the flat narration, ^r beyond the images that meet the eye. According to some of the structuralists, myths require what is called ' symp- tomic reading' to find out the ' problematic ' beyond the flat narration.36 The ' problematic ' lies beyond a conceptual structure, that is enclosed by, and forms, the narration. To study a myth, and get to the problematic, it is necessary to identify and separate the various layers of structure, sort out the homologues and arrange them. For this, all available variations and versions of a particular myth have to be studied. The same is true of the dreams of an individual, to find out the workings of his mind, or to decide his mental problem. It is, thus, clear that a myth reflects the mind of a tribe or a society, in that particular period ; and, a dream reflects the mind of an individual. At the stage of the interpretation of dreams, or when pro- fessional interpreters and soothsayers are at work even on a single dream, certain symbols set in the particular society are exploited. The Hindu Context : The earliest record about the belief regarding the dream occurs in the Çgveda ( fi V ). From it becomes clear that dream was a matter of despon- dency, or unhappiness. A seer says, that he is equally unhappy for two things : for a dream and for the wealth of a person who does not enjoy it nor give it for the use of the needy ( I. 120 12 adhã svapnasya nir vide abhuñja- tai ca r evala h ) ; because both - the dream and the wealth - are transient. But, it appears that the concept of the dream being transient is not so much involved here, as that of its causing unhappituss. The reason is, that a dream is something different from the usual experience in the waking state, and one cannot understand its nature and meaning. It is a matter of experi- " Peter Green, Alexander of Macedón, Uni. of California I ress, Berkeley, Lot Angeles, 1991, p. 164. »' Ibid. 3* Miriam Glucksman, op. cit. p. 3 ff.</page><page sequence="13">Dange : Dream, Myth and the Hindu Context 73 enee, that in a dreem even a close friend might cause fear, a thief may lead us astray and a crooked one may do the same thing ( II. 28. 10 ). It should be noted, that the whole thought here centers round the dream. Wendy O* Flaherty®7 sees ambiguity here and feels that this expression is a mixture of the dreaming state and the waking one, the friend being seen in the dream and the others in the waking state. - She compares this place with another one (X. 164 5), which employs the term jõgrat-svapnah ( wakeful dream ), and is prone to feel that the expressions at both places iudicate a mixture of the state of dream and waking. However, this does not seem to be so. In the first place, noted above, there seems to be hardly any ground for her doubt. " Are the thief and the wolf ( she takes the word vrkah literally ; it iodicates a ' crooked person * at many places )3* part of the dream, too, or part of a contrasting reality ? " At the other place, in an earlier verse in the same hymn, a separate mention is made of the dream state and the wak* ing ( v. 3 upa-arima jãgrato yat svapnatah ) and the commentator, SSyana, rightly takes them as separate ( jâgaranãvasthãyãm vartamõnã vayam... yat ca svapnãvasthãm prãptãh ). Even at the place, that has aroused a doubt in the mind of O' Flaherty ( v. 5 ), the expression jãgrat svapnah is an epithet of the word saňkalpah, which refers to the apprehension of sin in the mind. This apprehension of sin in the mind is desired to leave the person, who is pray- ing, and go to his enemy. The rise of apprehension could be relating to a dream or the waking state. SSyana is reliable even here ( jãgrat svapnava- sthayoh sambandhi papah ). The idea is that, as there could be a sinful thought in the dream, there could be so even in the wakeful state. But, the difference is that, in the dream state the dreamer has no control over his thoughts, unlike in the waking state. The point is clear at yet another expre- ssion, where the seer says that one is not in one's own control in dream, and that the case is similar when one is under the influence of wine, anger, out- of-mind condition ( acitti ) and dice ( VII. 86. 6 ). Dream is the « mixer of unrealities' ( Ib. anrtasya prayotã ). Dreams would be most tormenting in a physically unsound state, and the most delicate such state would be pregnancy. A whole hymn alludes to the probable dangers to the foetus in dream, or in the waking state, and they are sought to be warded off ( X. 162 ). The last verse in this hymn refers to the dream-state, and the chanting of this hymn as a charm is supposed to save the pregnant woman from any one ( male ) who might bewitch her into a dream and approach her ( nipadyate ) in that state of dream. Before we go further, it is necessary to see what the ST W. O. • Flaherty, op. oit., p. 14. 88 Cf. $V II. 23. 7 martah s anu ko vrkah, Pani called ; also VI. 51. 14 ; VII, 38. 7. 10 [Annals BOXI ]</page><page sequence="14">74 Armala BORI, LXXIX ( 1998) implication of the word nìpadyate is. Apart from the two places in the hymn ( vv. 5 and 6 ), the word does not occur in $V. Säyana, the commentator, renders it as abhigacchati ( ' attacks ' or * comes down upon ' ). This is not necessarily a sexual advance. Wendy O ' Flaherty takes it to mean " rapes while Oeldner takes it in the sense of ' lying ' or ' sleeping ' ( beschläft ). This might not be unsound if the attacking person ( or the evil ) takes the form of her husband {pati) or a paramour ( jãra ), and the woman could easily be deceived into sexual union. But, how if he does so in the form of a brother ( cf. v. 5 yastva bhrãtã patir bhütvä jaro bhãtvã ñipa- dyate ) ? In the former case, the pregnant woman might not be able to know his real nature, and she would not mind. But, the idea that he tries to " rape " her in the form of her brother is morbid. The sense of the word, hence, is not of " raping " or '' sleeping with but that of agressive advance and harm to the foetus ( cf. SSyag i, garbhaghãtam karoti ). How this parti- cular verse ( v 5 ) indicates that the person " shidej off into the actual person who rapes the woman, by trasforming himself when she is awake '* ( Wendy O ' Flaherty, p. 15) is difficult to jnderstand. The encounter has to be taken as being in the dream, rather than in the illusion or a waking dream. The idea of protection from a dream was from a bad dr¿am, hence, there is hardly any reference to good dreams, or auspicious dreams in Thus, we have Vfsäkapi, the virile ape, sacrificed after being involved in a sexual ritual,39 praised as svapna-namšanah (X. 86. 21, "O destroyer of dreams"; SSyaça, svapnBnãm nãiayitã ). Atone place ( II. 15. 9), Indra is said to have vanquished the demons Cumuri and Dhuni by overpowering them with svapna, which may indicate plunging them in a dream, or just ' in sleep '; because, the word svapna means both ' sleep ' and ' dream At yet another place (VII. 19. 4), the expression is simply asvãpayah, which would mean, "caused to sleep but, svapnenãbhyupya at the fot mer place ( II. 15.9), probably, has tobe taken as indicating a creation of fear in the dream (cf. abhi +/ yap &gt;/ up + ya = abhyupya ). R V does not dwell on the formation, or the nature, of a dream. The Atharvaveda attempts it. According to the Atharvaveda ( AV ), Dream is a deity; and it is requested to avoid bad dreams. It is s.iid to te neither sentient nor dead (^FVI. 46. 1 najlvo 'si na mrtah ), which would indicate Mie belief that it is of the nature of a ghost 1 In other words, it is both real and unreal, 39 Dange, Sexual Symbolism from the Vedic Ritual, Ajanta Books International, Delhi, 1979, p. 172 ff; earlier, Veiio Concept of 'Fieli* and the Divine Fructification, University of Bombay, Bombay. 1971, pp. 48- 66; Towards Under- standing Hindu Myth ».

In contrast to where it is associated with the god Varupa ( II. 28. 10 ; VII. 86. 6 above ), here VaruçSnl ( the wife, or the female aspect, of Varuna ) is said to be the mother of Dream, while his father is said to be Yama, the god of death. Dream itself is said to be named Araru. This word appears as the name of a four-footed demon ; (RVX. 99. 10) and, in this particular context ( i. e. of the dream ), it would indicate the fleeting nature of dream ( cf. Sãyaça, aranašílah) Dream is also said to be the " son of the sisters of the gods " the tool of Yama and death itself ( AV VI. 46. 2 ). At another place, Dream is said to be the " foetus of the wives of the gods" (A V XIX. 57. 3). The belief regarding Dream is, hence, clear. He is divine, demoniac, and is an aspect of death. As an aspect of death, Dream is sleep itself, and, the creative aspect of Dream is experienced in the various fragments of images in a dream. In this aspect, the dream is the tool of Yama, as noted above, and also his hand ( lb. 57. 3 ). We may compare here the belief about dream among the ancient Greeks. Somnus or Hypnos ( cf. Sanskrit svapnas &gt; svapnah ) was the god of sleep and dreams ; both sleep and dream were related to Death, who was their brother. Their abode was the ' Black country " where a cock did not cry. [ The indi- cation is that the cock-cry, and the sun-rise heralded by it, were outside their domain. ] In this domain gently flowing Lethe, the river of forgetfulness, caused sleep with her softly murmering waters. One is doubtful if Coleridge was not influenced by this belief when the following lines rippled down his pen, used to the flight of his subtle imaginatinn i In Zanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree Where Alph, the sacred river ran, Through caverns measureless to man, Down to a sunless sea. The Vedic Hindu idea about the nature of Dream will be clear from the following : " From the domain of Yama you have arrived here; with faultification ( pramadã )40 you associate the mortals. You, the knower ( guide ), move aTong with the solitary one ( i. e. the dreamer, who is accompanied by none under the cover of sleep ), in the womb of the Asura, fashioning the dream. On the one day ( the very first ) before the birth of the night, the all-collect- 10 Whitney (W. D.) renders the word pramadã as "with mirth (?)" (question mark bis ).</page><page sequence="16">% Armais BORI, LXXIX ( 1998 ) ing ' Bond ' ( i. e. the principle that keeps things together) saw you. Thence were you born, O Dream, hiding your form from physicians" ( AVX IX. 56.1-2). The dream was created at the joint of the first day and the first night which implies that it is not totally dark, nor is it totally bright. The dicho» tomy is comparable with the dream being neither sentient nor dead. Its being unfathomable even to the physicians would indicate that, at the period of AV ( even before its composition as distinct from its com pilation-A)m A/lã ) efforts for interpretation of dreams were in practice. It also suggests that these efforts were not fool-proof. In the Upaniçads (about 1000 B. C. ) we have some more traces of investigation into the formation of dreams. The Praina Up. ( IV. 5 ) informs us that in dream, the ' god ' ( devah, the soul ) experiences greatness. Here he sees the same things he has already seen. What is heard before, he hears again. And this experience is unrestricted. Whatever he has seen, heard, experienced before in various lands and quarters, he re-experiences. Not only this ; he even sees, hears and experiences entirely new things. He sees what exists and what does not ( sat ca asat ca ). He experiences all ; because be is all. It is further said ( lb. 6 ) that, when this * god ' gets engulfed with lustre ( tejasäbhibhütah bhavati ) he does not see any dream. The point is, whence is this lustre ? áañkara explains that this ' deva ' ( god ) enjoys the dream through the agency of the mind, which is a perfectly philosophical explanation ; but it overrides the simple psychological experience and the general folk-belief. For áaňkara the soul ( here Puru$a¡deva ), is beyond all faculties of the body including the mind. The soul, by itself, never sleeps nor wakes up. These activities are of the mind, and through it the soul gets their result. In deep sleep these faculties are not working ; because, the soul is engulfed in the lustre in the body itself, and this lustre acts as a blockade for external experience, áaňkara says, that the lustre is of the sun which is stationed in the bile in the arteries of the body ( saurem pittS- khyena íejasã nadišayena ). The ' god ' for áaňkara, now, is in the form of the mind ( manorüpo devafi ). This will show the confusion which the philo- sophical explanation of a purely psychologicl problem brings forth. Further oa, the Prašna Up. clearly states that the soul ( god ), who is the 4 vij nana - ímã purusah ( and experiences the dream ), gets established in the highest indestructible soul ( lb. 9 sa pare akçare ãtmani sam tis f hat e ). The sugges* tion is clear. As, after death, the soul merges in the ' Great soul ' ( parama • õtman), according to the common Hindu belief, so does the 'dreaming soul ' merge in the brilliance inside the body, which is the aspect of the Great</page><page sequence="17">DànGb : Dream, Myth and the Hindu Context 77 soul, áañkara's explanation of this lustre as being in the form of the bile (pitta) is in view of the fact of his philosophical conviction, that there is only one soul in the body - which is also traditionally supported. However, there lurks a belief about there being two souls in the body, as we shall see further. According to the Br hadar any aka Up. ( IV, 3. 9-10 ), of the u this Purusa " ( i. e. the soul ) there are two states. This ( world ) and the other world (idam ca paralokasthãnam ca ). There is also the third joining $tate of dream 9y (sandhyam trtiyam svapnasthänam). In this third state he sees both, this and the other world. According to the order, he should be in the other world ( after death ), but, while in the state of the joint that he stays in ( i. e. in the dream ), he crosses the order and ( in this life itself) sees both, the fruits of his sins and also joys. When he sleeps, he cuts a portion from the all-containing world ( of his experience ) and refashi- ons it with his own lustre and sleeps. In this state the Puru§a becomes endowed with his own lustre ( svayamjyotir bhavati ). In this state, in fact, there are no chariots, nor the horse* etc. that are yoked to the chariots, nor even the paths. There are no joys, nor pleasures, nor bliss ; he creates them all. He creates lakes, lotusful ponds and all. So, in the dream state the soul of the dreamer, who is said to be the deva at the Prašna Up., is said to be in full control of the state. Howevr, at the Prašna the lustre is the cover for warding off the impressions of the outside world, and indicates sound sleep, while here it is the state of lustre that creates the dream-images. That apart, the position that it is the (soul of the) dreamer that controls the images of the dream is not supported by modern research. The fact is that dream is perceptual. The dreamer can only see the images that are presen- ted before him ; he cannot control them, nor guide them. In the type called * Lucid Dream ', and the one known to the Tibetan mystics, by that name» the dreamer makes a conscious effort and is semiconscious. That is not the normal state of dream. The state of the joint, in which dreams are said to get formed, as noted above from the Brhad. Up is suggested to be called " the twilight state of consciousness " by Ranade.41 In any case, it is clear that in a dream impressions from the actual life are presented with a re-arran- gement - a position that is accepted by all. The deification of the soul in the Hindu philosophical context is due to its being considered as the aspect of the Great Soul that is said to control the cosmic activities. The Upani§a- dic explanation seems to have been based on a folk-tradition, as is clear in 41 R. D. Ranade, A Constructive Survey of Upanishadio Philosophy , Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bomfcuy, 3rd ed. 1986 ( 1926 ), p. 91.</page><page sequence="18">% Annals BORI, LIXIX (1993) the words of the Brhad. Up. itself, tad ete Sloka bhavanti. The word iloka indicates the tradition of hearing ( fr. Jíru, ' to hear ' ), and in songs. The purport of the verses ( in these songs ) is as follows : He (the soul-divinity) causes the faculties of the body ( éãrlram ) to swoon by dream. As they sleep he, not-sleeping, beholds them ( abhicãk* siiti). He, the Golden Puruça, dons on lustre and takes his position. Prote- cting the ' lower nest ' ( avaram kulãyam ) by the breaths, he, the immortal One, flies out as he desires. In the state of dream, this ' God ' flies high and tow, creating a multitude of images. He enjoys with women, and laughs, And gets afraid. His wanderings in this state, they ( the dreamers) see ; but, him they see not I They say, people should not suddenly awaken him ( tart I na Syatam bodhayed ityãhuh ) ; because, it ( his visible form, the body ) lies ptostrate ( in sleep ) ; and it may be difficult to restore it, when he ( soul ) suddenly returns to it. In the passage noted above, the word i Bri ra is taken by áaňkara to inean just sari ra ( body ), which is not happy. It is to be particularly noted, that this iloka tradition, which has to be taken as the folk-tradition, on which the philosophical exposition of the Upaniçad is based, says that ( i ) the Puruça goes out of the body and sees things outside ; ( ii ) the faculties of the body, and the body itself, are in the care of the vital breath. The vital breath, in a way, acts as the pseudo-soul to keep the body alive till the Master of the body returns ; and ( iii ) if the person is awakened suddenly, the soul may be in difficulty and the body might be beyond restoration to the original living state. The whole belief is to be found in many tribes. (I personally have knowledge of such a belief from south India. A person was asleep on a whole bench in the crowded train I boarded and was overcrow- ded, as 1 was travelling from Coimbatore to Madras in 1944. Nobody Was trying to awaken him though some people were standing. As I tried to awaken the person, others requested me not to do so. The reason given was that, by suddenly awakening him, he would be out of his mind. I learned later, that even a ticket-checker would not awaken a sleeping person. ) Some of the tribais believe that a person has two souls. In sleep one goes out of the body and communicates its experiences to the second soul that is restri- cted to the body. These form the dream.43 These experiences are true for 42 For example, the Dahomians of West Africa believe that everything, incliding the humans, has a double soul that stays away from the body. The Tasmanians and also the Haida have a similar belief ; for this see J. P. Murdock, Our Primitive Contemporaries, New York, 19S7 (1934), pp. 11, 252,534. For more Information see Dange, Divine Hymns and A noient Thought, Vol. {I, Navrang, New Delhi, 1995, p. 347.

This is why they believe that even the dead are alive some* where; " how else could they be seen?", they ask. The Upanisadic expo- sition is refined, as compared to its popular folk-source. Another point is, that, the folk-source ( or, we might call it a pre-Upanisadic source ) speaks of the Purusa leaving its kulãya , which mean« * nest ' (as Ranide has rightly rendered it). This would give the idea that the soul is conceived as a bird, in the mixed image of a * Bird-Man ' which is common to many tribes and people.43 Even Upanisadic passages elsewhere employ this image, which has its origin in # V in the image of the " Two birds that stay on the same tree 99 ( RV I. 164. 20 dva suparnã sayujã sakhãyã ; cf. Mundaka Up . III. 1. 1; ŠvetQšvatara Up. IV. 6. 7 ). One of these birds eats the sweet fruit ( enjoys the experiences ) ; the othe looks on ( abhicakašíti ), without eating. The word abhicakašlti in fi V, and in the Upani§ads that have taken the verse, exactly tallies with the one from the pre-Upanisadic folk-tradition noted above. The * Birds • that stay on the same tree are similar in all respects, differing only in degrees. There can be hardly any doubt that, in the oiginal image, the souls were ' birds ' It is less important which of the soul-birds is the Great. ..the one that stays in the body or the one that goes out. This would show that, even in the verse from the pre Upanisadic context the Hfe- breath that takes care of the body in the absence of the Great golden * Swan-Man ' ( hiranmayah purusah ekahamsah ) was, at the basic image, a soul-bird ; it was later seen as breath to distinguish it from the Great soul- bird. It will be interesting to note that, according to the ancient Chinese belief, there ere two souls in the body. One is P. O. which regulates the body and ceases with the death of the person. The second soul, called Him, carries with it the appearnce of the body wherever it goes.44 It is this soui that separates from the body and creates dreams. It is also thought, in the Hindu context, that a minute body ( suksma šaríra ), as distinct from the body, causes the emergence of dreams, while the soul remains in the body.40 But, can the « minute body ' have an existence whithout the soul ? In essence, the ' minute body • is nothing but an aspect of the soul - the « double f of the soul - like the Chinese Hun ! In modern terms of medical science, they are not souls ; they are two divisions of the brain - one active, the other According to th; ancient Egyptian belief Ka was the double of the physical body ; and Khu, representing the soul, was the double of the intellect ; it was represented as a bird ; see Donald Mackenzie, Egyptian Myth and Legend, p 90.

This holds good with the Puranic sources as well as with other works. For example, Harça dreams that a lion falls in the forest-fire and is burnt to death ; seeing this, his mate also throws herself in the same fire. Later, he learns that his father, King Prabhäkaravardhana had died, and that his mother had also entered fire ( BSna, Harsacaritam , II ). The period of the early Puräna texts coincides with the Atharvaveda parišista ( 6th century A. D. ), which records and classifies dreams, in some way following Sušruta ( 6th century B. C. ). The Atharava- parišista ( 68 ) mentions also many other dreams not connected with bodily disorders, as does Susruta. Some of the interpretations are as interesting as they are suggestive - and, also funny. Thus, it is said that if a person sees his head severed, blood flowing from his body and also sees a chariot in the dream, he is sure to become an army- chief. This is, obviously, a dream suggestive of valour. It prophesies its reward. Looking below this interpretation, one feels a belief that a dream can be a reality. If one sees his chest or penis cut, it portends happiness. If one sees two bolted doors of his house, or a door-post, or a bed shattered, that is an indication of the loss of wife. If one sees a yellow man mount his bed, the indication is that the dreamer's wife would be raped. 7 Some dreams from the Purägas are equally interesting, suggestive and fantastic. These texts classify dreams as auspicious and inauspicious. If one dreams that he is going through a ship, he would become a minister or a high official. If one sees a mare, a hen or a female heron, he is bound to get a wife. Surpri- singly, if one dreams that he has gone to hell, the indication is that he is soon getting a wife. ( Has it anything to do with the experiences in real life from a wife - at that period ? ). Among auspicious dreams is included sex in forbidden degrees, or with a forbidden woman ( agamy ã-gam ana ). Rid- ing upwards is auspicious. There are many such examples which need not be mentioned here.40 Anthony Stevens, op. cit . p 99 ; there are also thought to be three brains, lb. 100 ff. 47 W. O. ' Flaherty, op. cit . p. 19f. R. L. Van De .'Castle, not being familiar with the Hindu tradition, refers to the material from the Atharvaveda-parisista as from the Atharvaveda ( op. cit. p. 59 ). The former is a work of the sixth century A . D ; the latter {Atharvaveda ) is about 2000 B. C. Obviously, he did not check originals. Hence, his statements are amusing, u In the Vedas it is mentioned that to ride an elephant is a lucky dream, while to ride a donkey is an unlucky one"; also •• Atharvaveda indicates that images of violence and agression were considered to lead to success ".

Visions comprise images that get presented when a person is not sleeping. In other words, a vision is a wakeful dream. We would close with some examples of visions from RV. These examples are from those that stand apart from the general hymns and usual poetry. Like dreams, visions often show a mixture of ima- ges that originate from real life. The mystics who experience visions and express them could be morphists or photists and audiles, as Ranade has suggested ( op. cit., p. 257 ). Morphists or photists are those who see various images. The audiles are those who hear bliss-giving sounds. In RV they mostly verge on the photist-morphist category. In many cases they reflect the sacrificial context, or the working of the cosmos. In these visions, the seer avowedly says, that he has seen ( apaiyam ). In fact, RV suggests gran- des of poets. A poet could be a kãru, who fashions his poetry like an artisan. The other one is the rsi, the ' seer ' who sees different images in his flat experience ; or, past experiences and sights get re-set before his eyes with multiple kaleidoscopic images. Thus, a seer says that he has seen the gan~ dharva-s, with their hair flutteriug in the wind, as he went to the scene with his mind ( III. 38. 6 manosa jaganvSn ). The vision also speaks of the two kings ( Indra and Varuna ) who surround three extensive regions, to protect them. And, this happens in the sacrificial hall. Here is a mixture of the terrestrial sacrifice and the mid- region, the latter being suggested by the ' wind- haired ' gandharva-s. In another vision it is said that the young mother con- cealed the well-formed child in a • secret place ', not ( yet ) giving it to his father. People did not see his face, bidden as it was in an unclear place. However, the seer says that he saw the child as soon as he was released by the mother ; ( he knew ) that the foetus had grown for many years. As soon as the child was born, he saw him, moving out of the ksetra ( birth-place ), wielding his weapons. This is the vision of the fire flashing out of the wooden slab, as SSyaga says, inspite of the later fantastic myth from the Sãtyãyana Brahmano, which also he mentions. There are important images here, which got traditionally used, later. The birth of the fire, wielding his flame-weapons, is used to suggest a divine birth of a mortal ( for ex. of Dhrçtadyumna nnd Draupadi ).19 The other is of the ksetra ( here the woo- den slab, arapi) which, together with the corn-field, came to symbolise the womb; and ksetra- ja is a child produced from one who is not a husband. Yet 48 Mahãbhãrata, Ãdi 166 36-44. The earliest occurrence of this motif is at RV IV. 1-2 ; cf. also the myth of the birth of Aš maka, who became so large in his mother's womb that he could not come out. Hence his mother, Madayantl, had to use a stone to tear a part of her abdomen to take him out ( - a sort of ' ceasarean ' operation ? ). As maka was a k set raj a son of KalmSsapãda through Vasistha ; cf. Ib. 43-47. 11 [Annals BORI]</page><page sequence="22">82 Annals BORI, LXXIX ( 1998) another one is of the foetus getting larger in the womb itself and is reluctant to come out. There are other such visual images ( which I have studied elsewhere). But, we may conclude with a couple of them. In one the seer says t The One Bird has entered the ocean ; This whole creation does he watch ; With a ' ripe ' mind did I see him from close ; Him does the Mother lick, and well, he licks the Mother. ( ÇK X. 114.21) In the other one the seer is thrilled by a unique experience. He says i Where those Birds constantly chirp, Confident at their nectar-share, The Lord Protector of this whole creation - He, the Great, has entered me, the ripe one. (ÇFI. 164.21) The meaning of these visions ? You know, my learn d friends. Thank you.</page></plain_text>
