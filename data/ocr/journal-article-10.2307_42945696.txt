Like Finnegans Wake itself, this is a book about darkness and obscurity. In darkness and obscurity himself, John Bishop has labored on this book for ten or twelve years. Eight or nine years ago, he showed me a section of a very early draft of the manuscript he was working on. Working on a book about Finnegans Wake myself, I immediately recognized Bishop's remarkable orig- inality and suspected that this would eventually become very important work. This work has now evolved- after ten or more years for Bishop of gathering (like Joyce himself) countless little mosaics of detail and information and filling them into a whole of tremendous erudition- and emerged from its long night of obscurity into the wake of day. The starting point in any discussion of it has to be its unquestionable importance to Joyce studies, and the critical hoopla surrounding its emergence is well justified. It perhaps is equally justified to call this (as some have already done) the best book of critical interpretation of Finnegans Wake available; most previous studies of this most difficult and most hilarious of texts have been referential works- guidebooks, lexicons, al- lusion lists, or influence studies limited to a narrow and particular angle of approach- and are not comparable in scope to Bishop's book. Perhaps the only comparable critical work is Margot Norris's seminal deconstructive reading eleven years ago, The Decentered Universe of Finnegans Wake: both books have presented new, coherent, and all-encompassing modes/approaches to reading and interpreting the Wake. The approach that ties Bishop's book together is the basic tenet that, as Joyce put it, Finnegans Wake (in direct contrast to Ulysses ) is "about the night." Bishop writes: "The greatest obstacle to our comprehension of Fin- negans Wake since its publication has surely been a failure on the part of readers to believe that Joyce really meant what he said when he spoke of the book as a 'reconstruction of the nocturnal life' and an 'imitation of the dream- state' " (309); this reluctance "to think seriously about the very strange, literally unthinkable" topic of nighttime modes of experience/consciousness/uncon- sciousness has, Bishop argues, led to interpreting Joyce's comments as mere "impressionistic 'devices' that in [critical] practice have licensed interpretive mayhem on the one extreme hand and pedantic irrelevance on the other" (25); while Bishop himself is guilty of neither of these faults, his method may invite less acute practitioners to both, but more on that later. Bishop's own interpre- tive sense leads him frequently to lovely and illuminating close readings about the night, the period when (for example), "as the Wake puts it, 'there are two signs to turn to, the yest and the ist, . . . feeling aslip and wauking up' (597.10- 12): 'the yesť here is where night fell and where 'yest'erday disintegrated ('the west'), while 'ist' (or 'east') is where the day will break, and where the present always reappears ('is')" (20-21). In his "Introduction," Bishop discusses "the</page><page sequence="2">160 Book Reviews intensity with which Joyce studied dreams, read about dreams, and discussed dreams" (2 1 ); one can say the same of Bishop, who, armed with years of reading about dream theory (scientific, psychoanalytic, classical), scientific sleep studies (modern and traditional), and multitudes of obscure knowledge about the night, takes us to "nightschool" (25). In twelve exhaustively researched, remarkably erudite, and nevertheless impressively imaginative chapters of interpretive synthesis, Bishop applies his consciousness of night (and nocturnal uncon- sciousness) to original and persuasive understandings of the Wake's treatment of (in order): reading itself, the unconscious, the Wake's hero, Egyptology/ thanatology/eschatology, the identity of the dreamer, the Wake's geography, Vico, sight, sound, textuality, infancy, and femininity. In the opening chapter Bishop explains both his subject and his strategy for "Reading the Evening World." To begin with, we should always be con- scious that the imaginary landscape of the Wake is primarily anthropomorphic, the sleeping mass of the dreamer's corporeal body, dead to the world in the darkness of night. And Bishop's modus operandi is associative, focusing on a single association and following out a chain of associations, rather than trying to place details in a traditional sense of "narrative" context: "this associative way of proceeding, far from licensing anarchy, will in the long run capture meaning in a way that no amount of calculating rationalism ever could" (40; this seems to me true only in the hands of as skilled an interpreter as Bishop). The second chapter shows how the Wake, in attempting a presentation of nonconsciousness (or "no"-ing), represents "Real Absence" through "a whole strange language of negation, a system of reference to no experience," signifying "the absence of perception and the perception of nothing" in "the language of nihilation" (48), what Joyce called "nat language" (night/not language; cer- tainly not English). Bishop provides many fine examples: This "blink pitch" [FW 93.4] would in part be the "blank pitch" that gels beneath [the dreamer's] closed eyelids, as if under a "black patch," when they "blink" for "one eyegon- black" (16.29) and pass out of dreams- no matter whether the "eye go black" for one moment (Ger. ein Augenblick) or hours. But since Finnegans Wake . . . [is] suffused with the negative- the same "blink pitch" would also denote the obliterate representation of sleep's "black pitch" in Finnegans Wake on "the blank page." (48) In the Wake, Bishop argues, Joyce was "also exercising the whole twentieth- century fascination with nothingness . . . and the related properties of aborig- inality, prehistory, unconsciousness, and nothingness" (63). The third chapter shows how our hero "Finnegan" is, in the uncon- sciousness of sleep, dead to the world, thus blurring, as in a wake/waking (and in "The Ballad of Tim Finnegan"), the distinction between sleep and death, so that his bed becomes a worm-infested cemetery and this book of the dark becomes a "book of the dead" written in the "vermicular" (FW 82.12; L. vermiculus, worm). Thus, the Wake and the long night's progress toward wak-</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 161 ing become "a survey of world eschatology" (78). The fourth chapter supports this claim by examining the vital presence of the Egyptian Book of the Dead as a conceptual model for Joyce's book of the dark (Joyce tried to get Frank Budgen to write an article on the Wake titled "James Joyce's Book of the Dead"). Detailing hundreds of references in Finnegans Wake to Egyptian than- atology and resurrection myths, Bishop shows how, just as the Book of the Dead (or "The Chapters of Coming Forth By Day") is a guidebook for corpses successfully to survive Amenti (the Egyptian afterdeath) and attain resurrec- tion, so also Finnegans Wake guides its sleeper through his amental night of unconsciousness to the morning's "coming forth by day." This chapter of what Bishop calls "applied Egyptology" is very convincing in showing that, in every- thing from its extraterrestrial geographies to HCE's bed/mastaba-tomb, the Egyptian Book of the Dead "provided Joyce with a richly inflected hieroglyphy adequate to the reconstruction of a calmly sleeping twentieth-century man" (125). In one of the book's weaker chapters, Bishop, discussing the nature of the dreamer HCE (whose daytime self seems to be an older, Protestant male Dubliner of Scandinavian descent who is involved in the pubkeeping business), does usefully emphasize that "concealed beneath every manifest appearance in the Wake's nocturnal universe is the unconscious body of its sleeper. . . . Finnegans Wake ... is a presentation of a human body" (143). The chapter which follows, on the Wake's nocturnal geography," develops that notion per- suasively, showing how the geography of Dublin in which the story takes place is in reality the sleeper's body in which his dreams take place, so that "the two sets of maps, then- one of surface geometries and objective relations, the other of subliminal and emotional relations- might be seen as distortions of each other" (166); thus, for example, the Wake's central "crime" in Phoenix Park is not a real one but a dreamt crime in "Phornix Park" (FW 80.06), in that private part of one's sleeping body. The tension is between modernist subjectivism and classical "objectivism," the distorted perspective of dreams mocking the fabrications of the traditional authorities and axioms of the day- time universe. Thus, the book, Bishop argues, presents a very antiauthoritarian, revolutionary world of rebellious night forces: the night world's "aggressive forces and illicit pleasures" buck the authority of the daytime world of the maps of Dublin and Europe, which depend on "authority as a collective en- terprise and on languages as a system"; "there are no rules down here" (170). Bishop thus persuasively presents the Wake (a "work so anti-authoritarian" as to be outside the fringes even "of any orthodox form of Marxism [171]) as a struggle between day and night worlds, equal and opposite, producing in- cessant tensions on the body politic and on the body of our sleeper. In the brilliant seventh chapter on Vico's The New Science, Bishop shows how Joyce's obsession with Vico (and his claim that Vico anticipated Freud) goes way beyond the simplistic critical commonplace that Joyce modeled the</page><page sequence="4">162 Book Reviews Wake on Vico's cyclical concept of history. In his historical/linguistic/psy- chological interests, Vico argued that individuals and language are both trans- mitters of a culture's history/ideology/psychology (thus going beyond Freuďs individualized psychology); Vico's own dense, punning language in The New Science, like that of the Wake, suggests the relationship between national/ generational struggles and genital struggles, devising "a system of interpretation not unlike dream interpretation" and "treating philology as a protoform by psychoanalysis" (195-96). Vico gave to Joyce "a psychology of the unconscious, an account of dream formation, and a system of dream interpretation . . . synthetically integrated into a social history and a linguistic vision" (209). Thus, in Vico's etymological/historical system, the word is a multilayered pun conveying past history, and the individual is "Here Comes Everybody," and his mind contains all thoughts and all history: Paradoxically set entirely within an individual body, [the Wake] devastates as completely as the condition of sleep the whole notion of discrete individuality. ... As social in its vision of individual personality as The New Science, Finnegans Wake. . . represents [HCE's] mind in the displaced guises of all those others who have made that mind what it is. . . . The "ideal universal history" that Vico discovered beneath the consciousness of everyone born in the enlightened present, Joyce made a living, dynamic world in Finnegans Wake. Its prose is the prose of the world. (214-15) This is criticism at its best. In an important chapter on the subjective "meoptics" of the sleeper's dream "vision" (since there is no light at night and the only "vision " is the internal one of dream), Bishop shows how the Wake anticipated contemporary phenomenology and psychoanalysis "in showing how our hero's seeing is idio- syncratic and subjective": "The Wake's 'meoptics' is an eroticized optics," making "the seer and the seen . . . aspects of each other" (244-45). One central version of this double focus has the dreamer "acting as both the unconsciously canny producer ('Shem') and the consciously baffled consumer ('Shaun')" (247) of the erotic dream spectacle, the latter (as in Ego over Id) trying to censor Shem ("Shames") by "thrusting him back 'down under' into the invisible" (243). Thus Joyce's "meoptics" provide a kind of dream/Unconscious theory of libido expression/repression: Shem scripts his "traumscrapt" (dream-script) on the foolscap of his own eyelids; his "letter" comes from "down under" (the "shame"-ful nether parts), transmitting itself into the dreamer's letter-stuffed, censorious head (Shaun the Post) in a "visible" dream. HCE's is a body and a life (like our own) in conflict with itself. In a parallel chapter, Bishop shows how important hearing is in the Wake, since a sleeper's ears are still open, metamorphosing the sounds of his own body (belches, snoring, flatulence) and of the night (sirens, mail-trains, dogs barking) into the "phonemanon" (FW 258.22) of dreams. Sounds, like earwigs, crawl into one's ear and distort them- selves into the dream/gossip of the Wake, "the gossiple so delivered in his</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 163 epistolear" (FW 38.23). Overhearing and gossip thus become a central prin- ciple/metaphor in the text and in its ungospelled indeterminacy. A short but significant disquisition on the methodology of reading Fin- negans Wake follows, an appeal to the exercise of associative, nonnarrative intuition and imagination over the literalism occasioned by our trained day- time systems of logic and narrative. As Joyce himself remarked about sleep: "one great part of human existence is passed in a state which cannot be ren- dered sensible by the use of wideawake language, cutanddry grammar and goahead plot" (316); Finnegans Wake, like a dream, is thus full of riddles: "And just as the analysis of a dream produces a sudden recognition," Bishop writes, "so a good [reading of the Wake ] works to liberate everyone's repressed laughter, whose release is the sign that the book has been read rightly: in risu Veritas, as Joyce remarked on the Wake" (314). Joyce's development of a linguistic night style ("nat language") of comic liberation should elicit from us a similarly unrepressed stylistics of reading. One way of doing so is to regress to infantile simplicity and openness, especially since infantile regression is a central aspect of dream interpretation; Finnegans Wake similarly reconstructs infancy and childhood, the next chapter shows, for, like sleep, they evoke times when the head was not in full and rational control of consciousness. Thus, the Wake is "this nonday diary, this allnights newseryreel" {FW 489.35; a nonday nightscript, newsreel, and nursery rhyme) full of buried memories of nursery rhymes, baby talk, childhood riddles, and so on. As with the night's unrestrained riot of libido liberation in dreams motivated by an erotic pleasure principle, children riot against the stodgy authority of adult logic and rationalism- like the Mannekin-Pis, ubiquitous in the Wake, thumbing his nose at civilization by urinating in public. The final chapter- on "Anna Livia Plurabelle" 's "Riverbabble"- is per- haps the book's most ambitious; at times not fully convincing, it is nevertheless compelling, impassioned, even lyrical. Since in sleep what the ear hears is mainly its own blood sounding as a rush of water, Finnegans Wake (Bishop argues) is full of bodies of water, especially the "Anna Livia Plurabelle" chapter (crammed with river names), since Joyce reached inductively Freud's notions that foetal sleep returns us to the water-filled womb of our amniotic origins. Through the omphalos we are tied by amor matris to the whole "watery world" (FW 452.30), that bond of human love and compassion known to all men and which is the source of genius and creativity. (As Bishop rightly argues, "far from being the work of the cold and cerebral writer, the Wake is a work of exorbitant and almost overwhelming passion and compassion" [371].) Thus the liquid language of "Anna Livia" is "a form of creative power, feminine rather than masculine because it escapes traditional phallologocentric mastery and control" (381), escapes the "patrilinear" (FW 279.04; patriarchal and lin- ear) way of reading narratives by diving into the associative and fluvial depths of dream; Finnegans Wake thus becomes something of a "New Free Woman</page><page sequence="6">164 Book Reviews with novel inside" (FW 145.29), a "Brook of Life" (FW 264.06), a "mamafesta" (FW 104.04; rather than a patriarchal manifesto), "ultimately declaring, in times out of joint, the power of the 'the fruit of the womb' " (384). Finnegans Wake opens up "to a capacity not to trap and domesticate the unknown with what is already known, but to move with flexibility into a future potentially rich in 'plurabilities' "; it thus requires that, as readers, "we engage [it] with some resourcefulness and play, [make] its reading as unpredictable as children can be, flooding the future with the prospect of unforeseen 'plurabilities' that signal growth, vitality, and change" (384). As a plea for understanding a book written in a mode of "nat language" that is dark, insurgently comic, liquidly feminine, and- like children- resistant to traditional grammars and logics, Bishop's book in depicting the Wake's antistyle (the night's not-language) is itself an important study of style. This book's contribution, it should be clear by now, is major and mind- expanding in directing us to a night-oriented consciousness/perspective/em- phasis in our reading of Finnegans Wake. But while this new consciousness argues for a new way of reading the Wake, I do have nagging reservations about Bishop's associative way of interpreting- brilliantly, but often radically out of context. Bishop has anticipated this objection, writing late in the book: Long before now, the reader will perhaps have objected that the kind of reading by which even one paragraph of Finnegans Wake has been made to yield sense has licensed me to lift quotations from all over the book, ripping single words out of context and attributing to the Wake's sleeping hero phrases that ostensibly bear on other characters . . . practicing on Finnegans Wake a kind of textually self-endorsed "Sortes Virgi[l]ianae." (305) This is in fact exactly my quibble (even the precise analogy I had in mind while reading). Sentences from Bishop's book are largely spliced together with phrases or words quoted from different sections of Finnegans Wake, frequently out of context; in fact, one armed with the Concordance to Finnegans Wake could practice just this sort of Sortes Virgiliae, since the Wake contains a thesaurus's worth of word forms and could be used to splice together any conceivable statement. So also the devil could quote the Bible or Shakespeare to his purposes. (For example, ten years ago I was amused, as a fan of the Golden State Warriors basketball team, to notice that "Rick . . . Barry" [FW 134.11] "jumpst shootst" [626.05] in Finnegans Wake.) Bishop's own argu- ments are thoroughly convincing because he is a sharp, attentive, thorough, and conscientious close reader; it is clear enough that he knows what he is doing, and the mass of his accumulated evidence proves his dedication to reading the Wake as Joyce intended it to be understood. But his method may invite less gifted, less conscientious readers to practice what Bishop himself openly objects to: that is, "to regard the Wake as a free-floating scud of signifiers disengaged from contact with the concrete" (299).</page><page sequence="7">Book Reviews 165 Finally, there is another drawback to this sort of critical writing. While it is a dazzling performance (inventive, lively, instructive), it is also distract- ingly rough sledding: the sheer density of Wakean quotations makes the book's texture at times nearly as opaque as the Wake itself, occasionally leaving the reader a bit numb from the bombardment (random phrase from page 50 for example: " 'every dimmed letter' [424.32] comprising the 'blurry words' [425. 1 3] of Joyce's 'sordomutic' 'nonday diary' [489.35]"). Nevertheless, I come away with both gratitude for this major critical contribution and a renewed sense of the wonderful and epiphanic fun involved in reading Joyce's book about the strange, undocumented third of our lives spent in sleep. It should be strange. In Bishop's book we learn, for example, that Swahili, Eskimo, and Dutch words found in the "Anna Livia" chapter are there (in a chapter about water/depths and womb/origins) because Swahili is spoken at the source of the Nile (traditionally the mother of civilizations), Dutch is spoken in Nederlands (literally, the nether-lands) and was the land of "remembrandts" (FW 403.10), and Eskimos live in houses made of "water" (igloos). As Bishop notes in a throwaway line from an endnote, "Nobody ever said that Joyce, Finnegans Wake, or the night and the unconscious were not strange" (459). Strange, but wonderful and fun; as Bishop concludes about the Wake. "More people should join in its fun" (385). Vincent J. Cheng</page></plain_text>
