<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SO-CALLED ANTI-ANTHROPOMORPHISMS IN THE GREEK TEXT OF DEUTERONOMY1 In any translation there is always a possibility that the translator will modify the meaning of the original language. A certain amount of this is to be ex- pected. The question, however, is just how much of this modification of meaning is the natural result of the translation process and just how much of it repre- sents a particular Tendenz on the part of the translator. This question has long been a concern of students of the Greek Old Testa- ment, viz. , "Does the Greek translation of the Old Testament exhibit a particular theological Tendenz?' Charles T. Fritsch, for example, has attempted to show that there was an anti-anthropomorphic bias on the part of the LXX translators, i.e., he feels that the Greek translators of the Pentateuch removed or toned down many of the human qualities and emotions attributed to God in the Hebrew OT.2 Not all scholars, however, are in agreement with Fritsch's conclusions. Harry M. Orlinsky is one. In reviewing Fritsch's work, Orlinsky felt that Dr. Fritsch had allowed himself "to be misled by his predecessors into accepting as a premise what he should first have demonstrated to be a true proposition."3 In other words, Fritsch should have proved that he was really dealing with anti-anthropomorphisms before assembling, classifying and discussing them as such. Orlinsky thus concluded that What have been regarded by virtually everyone as instances of an anti-anthropomorphic attitude on the part of the Septuagint translators are the result of nothing more tendencious than mere stylism, theology and philosophy playing no direct role what- ever in the matter.4 1 This article was adapted from a portion of the conclusions of a doctoral dissertation, entitled The Greek Translators of Deuteronomy, which was presented to the graduate faculty of Yale University in 1972. 1 Charles T.

If one substitutes the term "literal" for non-anti-anthropomorphic and the term "free" for "anti-anthropomorphic," one has a better understanding of the translator's style. Fritsch has distorted the evidence so that the only way for the translator to be free of any accusation of Tendenz is for him to translate literally. The moment he renders the Hebrew into Greek in an idiomatic manner he becomes guilty of anti-anthropomorphisms. Fritsch suggests that the omission of the possessive pronoun in Dt 32:10 ("his eye" becomes "of an eye") makes the relationship with God less intimate.5 Yet if one examines the entire book of Dt, one finds that this is just a feature of the translator's style in general; the omission of the possessive pronoun is not restricted to the so-called anti-anthropomorphic passages. E.g., the Greek has no possessive pronoun for a corresponding Hebrew suffix in the following passages: 3:27; 4:39; 6:17; 7:10(to); 8:11; 9:21; 11:2(0«), 10,18; 12:7,15,17,19; 15:11; 16:18; 18:8; 19:5; 20:14; 21:6,19; 22:15; 23:25; 24:15; 25:4,11; 26:13,17; 27:12,17,22(ô/s); 28:54,56; 29: 10(11), 17(1 8), 22(23); 31:24,30; 32:10; 33:3,16 (bis), 17. The translator adds a possessive pronoun in 4:25; 21:15; 23:11(10); 24:19; 26:13; 28:53(¿&gt;¿s),55,56,57; 32:16,32. He omits an object pronoun in 2:21,35; 7:10(Ws),ll,15; 9:6; 10:8; 12:22,24; 14:21(20); 18:14,22 (ta); 21:1 (bis); 23:4(3), 6(5), 9(8), 22(21), 25; 25:14; 28:48,68. He adds it in 1:30,43; 3:3; 4:37; 5:33(30); 8:13; 9:21; 13:6(5); 14:2; 15:4; 18:1; 22:17; 26:19; 27:15; 28:10,29; 30:20; 32:25; 33:19; 34:1 1. It can thus be seen that there is clearly no anti-anthropomorphic tendency present here. It is merely a question of translation style. In 4:37 bpnyw is translated by the intensive pronoun autos. Is this an ex- ample of an anti-anthropomorphism? Orlinsky says, "A translation must make sense, and what sense would it make to reproduce the Hebrew literally ('. . . and he brought you forth with his face . . ,')?"6 Even Fritsch states, "The LXX has admirably reproduced its true meaning."7 Fritsch also finds a tendentious translation in Dt 1:45. The Hebrew reads wl' h'zyn 'lykm, "nor give ear unto you." The Greek renders this freely as oude proseschen hymin, "nor paid attention to you." Fritsch feels that the presence of the reference to the "ear" of God was found objectionable by the translator.' In other words, since the verb is translated idiomatically, it is an anti-anthropomorphism. Only by translating it literally would the translator be free of this charge- in Fritsch's view, that is. It is noteworthy that the hiphil 5 Fritsch, 11. 6 Orlinsky, Review 1 57; cf. his discussion on the meaning of pnym. 7 Fritsch, 12. ' Ibid., 13.</page><page sequence="3">1976] So-Called Anti-Anthropomorphisms 31 of 'zn appears only twice (1:45; 32:1) in Dt. Both times it is translated by prosechõ. The Hebrew word 'p, "nostril," came to mean "anger." The Gk thus trans- lates the word by orgë and thymos, "Anger, wrath." Thus the rendering in Dt 33:10 is not the result of a conscious anti-anthropomorphism,' but rather the result of a consistency of translation. As Orlinsky states, If the translators rendered the Heb. word for "anger" ( 'ap' in connection with its correspondent in Greek (orgē, thymos) rather than by the other meaning of the same word, "nostril," it was surely not for the purpose of "obscuring the physical association" (p. 13) but simply because the use of the term "nostril" would have been devoid not only of intelligibility in the context but also of philological justification.10 Even Fritsch agrees that this translation "is true in its use with God as well as with man."11 In 33:27 zr't 'wlm, "the everlasting arms," is rendered in Gk as ischyn brachionòn aenaõn, "The power of everlasting arms." In Fritsch's opinion, "By introducing this abstract idea of power into the phrase the Gk has definitely weakened the anthropomorphism of the Hebrew."12 Quite the con- trary, this practice of introducing an extra word appears throughout the book: In 2:5 the Hebrew has "to Esau"; the Gk has "to the sons of Esau"; "water" in 2:6 becomes "water (by) measure." In 8:20 "as the nations" becomes "as also the remaining nations." In 9:10 "and upon them according to" becomes "and upon them was written according to." In vs. 18 of the same chapter "as the first (time)" becomes "the second as the first (time)." In 1 1 :9 "to their seed" becomes "to their seed after them." In 15:9 "word" becomes "hidden word." "Blood" in 19:10 becomes "liable to blood." In 21:6 "upon the heifer" is trans- lated as "upon the head of the heifer." "All the curses" in 29:19(20) becomes "all the curses of this covenant." It is therefore not a question of an anti- anthropomorphism in 33:27, especially since the "arm" of God is still present. That this is so is demonstrated by the fact that in Dt an extra word is frequently introduced in other passages, where there can be no question of theological considerations having influenced the choice. The results are the same with the so-called anti-anthropopathisms, the denial of human emotion to God. In Dt 32:36 the hithpael of nķm occurs. This can mean either "to be sorry" or "to be comforted."13 Fritsch feels that the ' Ibid., 14. 10 Orlinsky, Review 158. 11 Fritsch, 13. 12 Ibid., 15. 13 Francis Brown, Samuel Rolles Driver, and Charles A.

In Dt 3:26 Fritsch feels that the reference to the wrath of God is avoided because the translator renders the hithpa'al of 'br, "to be angry," by hyperaraõ, "to despise."15 Yet it seems that the act of despising surely involves an element of anger. Dt 32:27 is also considered anti-anthropopathic by Fritsch." The MT reads: "if it were not that I feared the provocation of the enemy." The LXX, however, reads: "if it were not because of the wrath of the enemies, lest they last long." It is true that gwr means "to fear," but it can also mean "to sojourn." Since the translation "not to last long" means the same thing as "to sojourn," the choice of this meaning of gwr is simply a matter of lexicography and not theological Tendenz. The hina (me) could have been suggested by the following pen 's. The change in person and number could be due to the following plural. Fritsch suggests that the translation of swr, "rock," in ch. 32 by theos was motivated by anti-anthropomorphic tendencies; "a more refined conception of God" was obtained in this manner." Yet perhaps, this translation was merely a non-figurative rendering of a metaphor, which is a legitimate translation practice.18 The referent is made clear. A similar tendency on the part of the translator can be seen with nps. In 12:15 it is translated by sou, "thy." In 24:15 the translator chooses elpis, "hope," as the suitable rendering. There can be no question of anti-anthropomorphisms here. The rendering of lb, "heart," by dianoia, "mind," in 4:39; 6:5; 7:17; 28:28,47; 29:17(18) is part of this same translation style. Another example is the choice of rhēma, "word," to translate ph, "mouth," in 1:26,43; 9:23; 34:5. In 32:48 b'$m hywm hzh is rendered as en tę hemerą tautę. Thus ch. 32 is not an isolated incident, but is rather part of the general translation style of the Gk text of Dt. In the chapter on "Motion and Place Denied to God," Frisch suggests that the idea of God's dwelling in a bush is avoided by the translation in Dt 33: 16. 19 The Gk verb is the passive of horaõ, meaning "to appear." Yet if one "appears" in a bush, then one most certainly is "dwelling" in it. In the Deuteronomic formula "the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there," the verb skn is consistently rendered 14 Fritsch, 18 n. 2. 15 Ibid., 19-20. 16 Ibid. ,20. 17 Ibid., 21. 18 Cf.

Fritsch feels that this is an anti- anthropomorphism, since the Lord does not cause his name to "dwell" there; it is merely "invoked."20 The Gk rendering is indeed interesting, but it need not be due to an anti-anthropomorphic tendency. It could very well be due to the influence of later theology. The phrase hbyt . . . nqr' smy 'lyw, "the house . . . upon which is called my name," appears in Jer 7:10,11,14,30; 32 (39):34; 34(41): 15. It is translated by epikaleomai, the same verb used in Deuteronomy. It is therefore entirely possible that this Hebrew phrase rather than any anti-anthropomorphic tendency influenced the translation in Deuteronomy. In 33:29 the noun mgn, "shield," is translated by the Gk verb hyperaspizõ, "to cover with a shield." Fritsch feels that the verbal idea has softened the figure.21 Yet a comparison of this passage with others in which a Hebrew noun is rendered by a Gk verb shows that this is not an uncommon stylistic device. For example, bkl mslh ydkm (12:7,18; 15:10; 28:8,20), "in every sending forth of your hand," is rendered epi pasin hou an ten cheira epibalēte, "in every (place) wherever you may send forth (your) hand." In 3:24, km 'syk, "according to your work," is translated as katha su epoiēsas, "according as you did." In .18:6 bkl 'wt npSw, "in every desire of his soul," is rendered kathoti epithumei hē psyche autou, "so far as his soul desires." The examples can be multiplied. Fritsch suggests that the substitution of a Gk passive verb for a Hebrew active verb shows how the Gk translators tried to remove the idea that God participates directly in the affairs of this world.22 His examples in Dt 2:30 and 4:36 are not convincing. In the first, "in order to deliver him" becomes "in order that he might be delivered." Fritsch's translation, "that he might deliver him," slants the reading: "He" is not in the Hebrew. The infinitive can best be rendered idiomatically by the passive; the other alternative would be to add an object pronoun. Moreover, the active verbs in the first part of the verse indicate clearly that God is participating directly in the events of the world. In 4:36 "his voice became audible" is merely a free translation of "he made you to hear his voice." Fritsch neglects to mention that many of the manuscripts have the literal translation, "he made audible to you his voice." Even with the free translation the result is the same: The Lord's voice is heard. The same holds true for 4: 10. Fritsch feels that the translators sometimes put an intermediary element between God and his interests; this would set God apart from the world. One method, he feels, was to render the Hebrew genitive relationship into Gk by 20 Ibid. , 34. 11 Ibid., 36. 21 Ibid., 49.</page><page sequence="6">34 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly (Vol.38 interposing a preposition between God and the object possessed.23 E.g., brkt yhwh (Dt 33:23), "a blessing of the Lord," is translated as eulogian para kyriou, "a blessing from the Lord." It is extremely difficult to maintain Fritsch's position. The Hebrew construct state is an ambiguous construction and does not always function in the same manner. How it is rendered into Greek depends upon its function in each case. In 33:23, "a blessing of the Lord" actually means "a blessing which is from the Lord, a blessing from the Lord," which is how the translator renders it. It is a matter of style, not of anti- anthropomorphism. The following examples confirm this: In 1:40 "the way of the Reed Sea" becomes "the way which is on the Reed Sea." "The way of Bashan" (3:1) becomes "the way which is toward Bashan." In 10:3 "an ark of acacia wood" is rendered into Greek as "an ark out of non-rotting wood." In 21:23 "a curse of God" becomes "a curse by God." "The beloved of the Lord" (33:12) becomes "the one loved by the Lord." In 33:26 "the rider of the heavens" becomes "the one riding upon the heavens." Occasionally the LXX renders the simple 'Ihym or yhwh by the expression ta pros ton theon (kyrion). According to Fritsch, "It is quite obvious that the neuter plural article with the preposition has been interposed in the Greek to serve as a verbal buffer between God and his activities in this world."24 It does not seem to be all that obvious to the writer. Pros + accusative can be used to indicate reference or relation; e.g., pros ton legon means "in refer- ence to the matter"; more to the point are such constructions as ta pros ton polemon, "military matters, equipment, etc." (Thucydides 2.17, etc.), ta pros ton basilea, "our relations with the king" (Thucydides 1.128), and ta pros tous theous, "our relations, i.e., our duties to the gods, etc." (Sophocles, Philoctetes 1441 J.23 It is therefore entirely possible that the substantivized preposition pros represents not a Tendenz but rather an idiomatic translation. In sum, there is no support for Fritsch's opinion that the LXX text of Deuteronomy exhibits an anti-anthropomorphic bias in its translation. The alleged examples of anti-anthropomorphisms are merely the result of a style which is not limited to theological matters, but rather is found throughout the entire book of Deuteronomy.
