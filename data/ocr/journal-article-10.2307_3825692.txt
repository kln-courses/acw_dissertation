Knoepflmacher PATER'S RELIGION OF SANITY: "PLATO AND PLATONISM" AS A DOCUMENT OF VICTORIAN UNBELIEF In later years he came upon philosophies which occupied him much in the estimate of the proportion of the sensuous and the ideal elements in human knowledge, the relative parts they bear in it; and, in his intellectual scheme, was led to assign very little to the abstract thought, and much to the sensible vehicle or occasion ... and he remembered gratefully how the Christian religion, hardly less than the religion of the ancient Greeks, translating so much of its spiritual verity into things that may be seen, condescends in part to sanction this infirmity, if so it be, of our human existence, wherein the world of sense is so much with us, and welcomed this thought as a kind of keeper and sentinel over his soul therein. WALTER PATER, "The Child in the House" (1878)1 l UBLISHED in the year prior to his death, Plato and Platonism ', 1 (1893), is unquestionably the most public piece of criticism by v≈Ω' Walter Pater, an ambitious synthesis of all the assumptions that underlie his scattered essays and works of fiction. Originally delivered as a series of lectures at Oxford, carefully planned and modulated, Plato and Platonism avowedly contains a recreation and re-assessment of the "environment" which produced the dialogues of Plato (P&amp;P, p. 10).2 1 Miscellaneous Studies: A Series of Essays, Library Edition (London, 1910), pp. 186- 187. Subsequent references are to this edition of Pater's works. 2 Just as Pater's Proustian essay, "The Child in the House," tries to recover a childhood atmosphere from the vantage point of the matured adulthood which is a direct out- growth of this atmosphere, so do Plato and Platonism and Marius try to isolate the original "environment" of a tradition from the vantage point of its later developments. "Environment" (which for Pater is almost synonymous with "atmosphere," another of DECEMBER 1962</page><page sequence="2">1U. C. Knoepflmacher Judged by the strictures of modern historical scholarship, Pater's re- production of this Hellenic "environment" seems highly fanciful. It con- sists of an arbitrary fusion of the doctrines of Plato and of certain of his predecessors (as "interpreted" by Pater) with the "visible" religion of the ancient Spartans. Judged by Pater's own standards, however, his loose application of Hegel's "historic method" is necessitated and sanc- tioned by his own painful awareness of the "ever-changing 'Time-Spirit' or Zeit-geist," the perennial flux which renders all things relative (p. 9) .3 Pater's fabrication of a new Platonism wholly "independent of, yet true in spirit to, the Platonism of the Platonic dialogues" (p. 269), is thus conditioned by the demands of his own age, an age he describes as one of "decadence," "rich and various in special apprehensions of truth" but "tentative and dubious in its sense of their ensemble" (pp. 282, 174). Plato and Platonism, then, like Marius the Epicurean, is to pro- vide a new "ensemble." As in the novel, Pater's patient reshuffling of the Pagan philosophies of the past is conducted, with an eye fixed on the present, through a system of oblique allusions and cross-references. Plato and Platonism is the last expression of Walter Pater's life-long search for a religious kernel to be found within the development of Greek thought, Greek art, and Greek mythology: a quasi-Christian "essence" contained within the Hellenic ideal. It is the final, most elab- his most recurrent terms) thus becomes an indispensable source for the physical and intellectual "influences" which it yields. "Environment" or "atmosphere" determines the man, who like Marius the Epicurean or the personae of Pater's Imaginary Portraits, is merely the product of its "influences": "In the intellectual as in the organic world the given product, its normal or abnormal characteristics, are determined, as people say, by the 'environment' " (P&amp;P, p. 10). In Marius, for instance, the physical "atmospheres" of "White-Nights," the young Roman's ancestral villa, or of the "church in the house of Cecilia," provide sensory influences which are as important as the intellectual influ- ences which affect "the house of [Marius'] thoughts" (Marius, II, 63). As Miss Jean Sudrann has convincingly demonstrated, in "Victorian Compromise and Modern Revolu- tion," ELH, XXVI (1959), 425-444, the search for an "environment," a "house," or a "city," is one of the prime metaphors which pattern Pater's novel. 3 Pater's acute awareness of historical development, of an inflexible, quasi-Marxian "prin- ciple of flamboyancy or fluidity in all things" (P&amp;P, p. 235), underlies all of his work. It is, as Philip Appleman has pointed out, in "Darwin, Pater, and a Crisis in Criticism," 1859: Entering an Age of Crisis (Bloomington, 1959), pp. 81-95, the stimulus for a critical relativism or impressionism to which it is essentially opposed. To Pater, the flux obstructs the aims of the idealist eager for stasis and permanence, but aids the critical relativist who regards the evolution of myths, ideas, or events of the past "with a view rather to a total impression than to the debate of particular points" (Greek Studies, p. 82). By recovering the impressions of past "environments," the relativist can test their present validity and applicability in an imaginative "interpretation." As Ernest Lee Tuveson shows, in The Imagination as a Means of Grace (Berkeley, 1960), p. 87, Pater's impressionism is a lineal "descendant of Lockian philosophy." But it is above all an impressionism sharpened by Pater's acceptance and revulsion over the mechanics of the Zeitgeist.

I In "Winckelmann," the essay which had formed the core of The Renaissance, Pater had written an eloquent defense of the immutability and universality of those feelings produced by the visual impressions of art and ritual. Abruptly, and without much logic, Pater had then identi- fied these feelings with a permanent aesthetic religion available to all. Ritual, the "religious observance," he argued, was a "fixed element" and consequently of enduring value in its adaptability to the motions of the Zeitgeist; ritual's abstract content, on the other hand, "myth" or dogma, was variable, ethereal, and therefore negligible (Renaissance, p. 203). Borrowing a simile made famous by Marx and Kingsley, Pater con- tinued: "Such Pagan worship, in spite of local variations, essentially one, is an element in all religions. It is the anodyne which the religious principle, like one administering opiates to the incurable, has added to the law which makes life sombre for the vast majority of mankind" (Renaissance, p. 202, my italics). Pater was to change the tone of this passage. Increasingly aware of the necessity for moral "law," he sought, in the years after The Renaissance, to speak to those concerned with the visible world of per- ception who, like the artist and the natural scientist, were (as he be- lieved) inclined to accept only the laws of their senses. He regarded the painstaking composition of Marius as nothing less than "a sort of duty."4 Pater excised the offending "Conclusion" from the second edition of The Renaissance (1877), and did not dare to reintroduce it until 1888, three years after the publication of Marius. He now agreed "to reprint it here, with some slight changes which bring it closer to my original meaning," but pointedly referred those "young men" who might have been misled by the "Conclusion" to the fuller treatment of "the thoughts suggested by it" in his novel (Renaissance, p. 233). There is little doubt that the entire controversy over The Renaissance forced Pater into a more scrupulous appraisal of what "his original meaning" had actually been. Was the aesthetic life, the cult of sensation "simply for those moments' sake" 4 From a letter to Violet Paget written in July 1883, quoted in A. C. Benson, Walter Pater (London, 1906), p. 90.

Was Hellenism nothing more than "finding the end of all endeavour in the aspects of human form" (Renaissance, p. 182)? Pater's re-appraisal led him to a partial rejection of his earlier, somewhat facile enthusiasm for an "universal pagan sentiment" (Renaissance, p. 201). It led him to test out his as- sumptions in thinly veiled "imaginary portraits" of young sensation- seekers. And it led him, at last, to the lectures of Plato and Platonism. Marius the Epicurean, His Sensations and Ideas, sets the stage for Plato and Platonism. The most complex of Pater's "imaginary por- traits," it is, despite its masterly evocations of past "atmospheres," a highly inconclusive work. The "constitutionally impressible" Marius is subjected to a series of "sensations and ideas," which convey, on the whole, the same philosophical systems that Pater was to re-examine in Plato and Platonism (Marius, II, 132) .5 Marius is ultimately brought in contact with the "environment" provided by a curiously Hellenistic Christian community whose apostolic religion is soon to be voided by the capricious Zeitgeist.6 Although it is clear that Pater considers the doc- trinal content of this religion as merely one of the "many voices it would be a moral weakness not to listen to," it is the "humanistic" impact of its rituals and of the symbol of the Eucharist which vaguely impresses on Marius the feeling of joyful renunciation that stimulates his almost acci- dental act of sacrifice (I, 44; II, 123). Marius offers no reconciliation. The book's intricate system of analogy and juxtaposition is designed to obviate the exclusiveness of any one "way" to truth. The novel's final effect is not derived from its struc- tured ascent to the Hellenized Christianity which appeals to both the 5 The discrepant religious and philosonhical systems examined by Marius originate, sig- nificantly enough, in the Platonic "environment" recreated in Plato and Platonism. Not only are the Epicurean and Stoic doctrines directly related by Pater to those ex- pounded by Plato's predecessors, Heraclitus and Parmenides (cf. fns. 13, 17, and 18, be- low), but even the "impressions" that Marius derives from his encounters with the teachers of the brotherhood of the Asclepiadae, of his Pisan instructor, of Lucian, and of Apuleius are represented as being Platonic. Marius himself links the brotherhood's ideal of purity to the "old Greek temperance" of Plato's Charmides and recognizes in its inculcated "love of visible beauty" the "point of view" of the Phaedrus (Marius, I, 34, 32); the lyceum of his tutor is described as "one of the many imitations of Plato's Academy" (I, 46); the two writers to whose work he is introduced by Flavian - "one Lucian" and Apuleius, the author of "the book of books" (I, 51, 55) - are met in per- son by Marius much later in the novel. The one proves to be a Socratic relativist who conforms to the "independent" Platonic tradition that Pater establishes in Plato and Platonism; the other is a Platonist to whom "the Ideas of Plato were no creatures of logical abstraction" (II, 87; for my comments on Apuleius' presumed "Platonism" see VS, IV [1961], 411-412). 6 Pater blames the loss of "the gracious spirit of the primitive church" on the persecutions it suffered by the Romans: driven into "exclusiveness," "puritanism," and an "ascetic gloom," Christianity will not recover its earlier "humanism" until the sixteenth-century Renaissance ( Marius, II, 118, 125).

But if Christianity cannot yield the one "way" to truth, it can at least endow Marius with the "spirit" with which he approaches the death he has feared for so long. This spirit is non- doctrinal. For Marius is impressed only by the "visible": the serene beauty of the silent young Christian Cornelius, the faces of the boys who sing a mysterious Jewish psalmody, the symbol of the Eucharist. The value of this "visible" Christianity lies in its continuity, the permanence of its symbols. For continuity, the adaptation to change and death, the flux itself, constitute the novel's main theme.7 Marius illustrates pri- marily the similarities between presumably antagonistic ways of life: between the materialism of Epicurus and the idealism of Aurelius, be- tween the satirical Apuleius of Flavian's "Euphuism" and the idealistic Apuleius concocted by Marius, between the anthropomorphic religion of Numa and the ritualistic religion of Christ, all illustrations of the dic- tum that "opposite issues" are "deducible from the same text" (I, 201). The central illustration of this text is the Christian death of a Pagan. The predicament of Pater is identical to that of Marius or to that of Florian Deleal, the character described in "The Child in the House" (1878), in the passage quoted as an epigraph above. Pater's conviction that any belief must be founded on the exclusive authority of the senses jarred with his deep religious sentiment, inimical to the inconclusiveness of the aesthetic life. The separation between "the sensuous and the ideal," in a world of permanent flux, informs all of Pater's work: Sebas- tian van Storck, Gaston de Latour, or Pater's version of Coleridge, are defeated by this irreconcilability. Although figures like Raphael, Sir Thomas Browne, Wordsworth, or Brother "Apollyon" may span the gap between the empirical truth of the senses and the ideal truths of religion and philosophy, their example cannot be followed: Browne and Raphael are aided by their belief in archaic religions invalidated by the Zeitgeist; Wordsworth, by a placid Pantheism that Pater refuses to accept. Brother "Apollyon" is himself a symbol of this unattainable fusion; he is a Greek god in disguise, a mythic embodiment of cyclical continuity. Plato and Platonism is the culmination of Pater's search for an 7 For an entirely different reading of the novel's meaning, see Bernard Duffey, "The Religion of Pater's Marius," Texas Studies of Literature and Language, II (1960), 103-114. Although I agree unreservedly with Mr. Duffey's interpretation of the novel as a redefinition of the position taken in The Renaissance, I cannot accept his concomi- tant belief that Marius somehow reflects a "central theology" analogous to that found in the works of F. D. Maurice (p. 106). DECEMBER 1962 155</page><page sequence="6">U. C. Knoepflmachcr aesthetic religion of form, a search begun only semi-consciously in The Renaissance. With the exception of Marius, a work to which it is closely linked, it is Pater's most "prophetic" piece of writing. Yet, as such, it also illustrates the peculiar characteristics which separate Pater from other Victorian critics of religion and culture. Unlike these, Pater is not a "reconciler." He cannot merge the empirical and the ideal into an ac- ceptable "spiritual verity" such as Matthew Arnold's "power not our- selves" or Samuel Butler's self-created "Evolutionary Personality." For Pater, the antagonism between sense and idea can be resolved only through a continuous act of qualification and elimination. Thus, re- ligion and philosophy are pared down, not only to a Victorian "essence" of their content, but to their "sensible vehicles," ritual and dialectic, and to the vague emotions that these provoke. The sweeping historical manip- ulations of Plato and Platonism, like the juxtapositions and alternations in Marius are designed to arouse the reader into a moder "religion of sanity" (P&amp;P, p. 227), which, unlike the lost Graeco-Christian "religion of cheerfulness" depicted in the novel (II, 114), is a curiously shrivelled cult of moral form, a pseudo-Christianity, which conserves the belief in "things that may be seen, hardly less than the religion of the ancient Greeks." II Fundamental belief gone, in almost all of us, at least some relics of it remain - queries, echoes, reactions, after-thoughts; and they help to make an atmosphere, a mental atmosphere, hazy perhaps, yet with many secrets of soothing light and shade, associating more definite objects to each other by a perspective pleasant to the inward eye against a hopefully receding background of remoter and ever remoter possibilities.8 Plato and Platonism is Pater's attempt to construct a "mental at- mosphere" out of his "independent" Platonism and of the shattered relics of its modern, Christian correlatives. The lectures are primarily addressed to the scientifically-minded doubter of a materialistic genera- tion, "the speculative young man of our own day" who finds solace in the sheer observation of "organism and environment, or protoplasm perhaps, or evolution, or the Zeit-geist and its doings," and who is unable to enlist these pursuits in a more comprehensive search (p. 154). Pater's "soothing" atmosphere is also directed at the opposing camp of those 8 "Prosper Merim6e," Miscellaneous Studies, p. 15. VICTORIAN STUDIES 156</page><page sequence="7">PATER S RELIGION OF SANITY who, like Wilde, Moore, or Dowson, regard the visible world as a mere source for pleasurable stimuli, in dangerous emulation of those decadent Athenians who affected what was "least fortunate in the habits, the pleasures, the sordid business of the class below them" (p. 274). Scien- tist and aesthete, both students of the palpable, both aware of the flux, are thus regarded as prospective converts to Pater's Hellenistic Chris- tianity, the "religion of sanity" to be reconstructed out of the visible remnants of the "tradition, the development," of Plato's thought and method. Although relying far more on the subtleties of inference and sug- gestion than on open polemics, Plato and Platonism follows the cast of the theological essays of Matthew Arnold, Pater's fellow-humanist and fellow-believer in the convolutions of the Zeitgeist. In St. Paul and Prot- estantism (1870), Arnold is concerned with the establishment of a tradition outside the realm of doctrinal religion; in Plato and Platonism, as we have seen, Pater attempts to set up a Platonism "independent of, yet true in spirit to, the Platonism of the Platonic dialogues." Yet the differences between the two men are noteworthy. While Arnold up- holds the literary permanence of the Biblical revelation over the fluidity of the Greek vision, it is precisely this fluidity "with no link on historic time" which attracts Pater to Hellenism (Greek Studies, p. 101). To Arnold, the Hellenic "banner of art and science" must yield its place to the Hebraic "banner of righteousness."9 To Pater, the Greek love of form merely survives in the humanism of Christianity. In Plato and Plato- nism (as in Greek Studies or in The Renaissance) the Hellenic ideal adapts itself, because of its concreteness, to the laws of change and mutability. Nonetheless, Pater's insistence on an all-Hellenic heritage and his seeming disregard of the Judaeo-Christian tradition are some- what misleading. Believing with most Victorian prophets that "a kind of religious influence" can be drawn, not only from "theological literature" itself, but from "profane" writers and artists, as well, Pater prefers to exert his own "influence" in what is ostensibly a discussion of Greek philosophy and form.10 Read correctly then, Plato and Platonism may be regarded as an aesthetician's latter-day equivalent of St. Paul and Protestantism, Litera- ture and Dogma (1873), and God and the Bible (1875). Searching like 9 Cf. Literature and Dogma (London, 1873), p. 354: "But conduct, plain matter as it is, is six-eighths of life, while art and science are only two-eighths." 10 "At their best, these writers become, as we say sometimes, 'prophets,' such a charac- ter depending on the effect not merely of their matter, but of their matter as allied to an 'electric affinity' with peculiar form" (Appreciations, p. 26).

Knoepflmacher Arnold for the "essence" of a contemporary faith and using Arnold's characteristic tools of analogy, antithesis, and speculative re-arrange- ment, Pater produces a work which is likewise anti-philosophical, anti- abstractionist, and anti-dogmatic in its bias. But whereas Arnold and most other Victorian reconcilers search for some time-honored and in- variable pool of human experience, Pater, forced to rely on an exclusive truth of the senses, "delights in tracing traditions" only to efface them (Appreciations, p. 244).11 The "atmosphere" which he holds out to his prospective Platonist is therefore far more tentative and disguised than Arnold's forthright presentation of his "essence" of Christianity.12 While Arnold boldly tries to recover the "secret of Jesus" through a reinterpre- tation of the Gospels and the Pauline epistles, Pater cautiously evades any open friction with traditional theology and adheres to a purely secular line of inquiry. Still, his frame of reference is unmistakably Christian. To Pater, the "environment" of the Platonic dialogues is the fountainhead of all subsequent systems of metaphysics and ethics; Christianity and its modern "relics" are therefore the outgrowth (or, at least, the analogous by-product) of the "independent" Platonism that he intends to retrace. Thus aided by his spatial theory, Pater not only avoids Arnold's frequently awkward attempts at biblical exegesis, but he also manages to side-step any polemical engagements with the established Church. Pater's historical theories impress on Plato and Platonism a scope far broader than that of Arnold's religious works or of Newman's Essay on Development. In Pater's system, the Pagan gn6sis merely becomes Christian "vision." Pater offers no "secret of Jesus," no "religion new- 11 As a fin-de-siecle spokesman of the "relative," Pater is far less positive than the majority of Victorian reconcilers. Arnold enlists the Zeitgeist in order to build a Church of England conformable to his cultured skepticism; Newman eventually relies on de- velopmental theories to stress the finite authority of the Roman Catholic Church; George Eliot employs the causal network of her novels to verify and confirm the existence of a separable ethical truth; Butler, Pater's contemporary, endows the evolutionary world of Darwin with a teleology of his own. Pater can follow none of these procedures. To him, evolutionism merely accentuates his disbelief in anything other than the phe- nomenal impression. Unlike George Eliot or Butler, he cannot bring himself to impress a deliberate purpose on a world he regards as dominated by perpetual flux- the vacuum of his relativism remains unfulfilled. He can accept even less the Invisible, like Newman, or a "reasonable" substitute, like Arnold. And, yet, like all of these "prophets," he attempts the standard fusion of feeling and thought. 12 Pater had a marked dislike for open polemics, very likely as a result of the controversy over The Renaissance. In his essay on "Sir Thomas Browne," for instance, he praises Browne's suspicion of theological disputations, while in "Pascal" he deems it necessary to point out that his subject's participation in the Jansenist controversies transcended the bounds of partisanship, belonging instead to "disputes not of a single age but of eternal ones" (Appreciations, pp. 131-132, 61). The same distrust of partisan "solu- tions" in the realm of religion colors Pater's review of Mrs. Humphry Ward's Robert Elsmere, discussed in the final pages of this study. VICTORIAN STUDIES 158</page><page sequence="9">PATER'S RELIGION OF SANITY given;" Hebraism, Aberglaube - terms integral to the Arnoldian type of inquiry - are carefully shunned.'3 Hellenism is a self-sufficient tradi- tion, containing in itself both desirable and undesirable extremes. Thus, Plato's abstracted and therefore undesirable "Theory of Ideas" is meta- morphosed by Pater into the "rude scholasticism of the pedantic Middle Ages" or into the "cold-blooded transcendentalism" of philosophers like Marcus Aurelius, Spinoza, or Kant, whose search for an "ideal city" is, like the search for the one "way" in Marius, destined to come to nought (P&amp;P, pp. 30, 164). Likewise, the "old Heracliteanism" of Plato's predecessors becomes the new Darwinian hypothesis, "the entire modern theory of 'development'," encouraging then as now, "the destructiveness of undisciplined youth" (pp. 19, 18). Conversely, however, the Platonic "environment" also has its positive side. Plato's skepticism and the dia- lectical method of his master, Socrates, have allowed unbelievers from Marius the Epicurean down to Montaigne and to Pater's contemporary "speculative young man" to find refuge in an "endless dialogue with one's self," "a habit" of "tentative thinking and suspended judgment" which balances the dogmata of theism and materialism (pp. 177, 194). What is more, the ritual and discipline of Sparta (somehow mirrored in The Republic as an ideal of harmonious form) remain as a tangible "religion of sanity" available even to those who have labored through- out the ages "with no prospect of Israel's reward" (pp. 227, 233). To the sympathetic observer, they provide a "soothing mental atmosphere" still to be found in the relics of Christianity. For the "graceful polytheism" of the Greeks merges with "the dulia of saints and angels in the catholic church" (p. 33); the "music" of the Lacedaemonians reverberates still in the chants of the Gregorian monks; the "hieratic Dorian architecture" of the Greek temples manages to survive in the "Cistercian Gothic" of the Middle Ages (pp. 278-279).14 According to Pater, "the Lacedaemonians were the hereditary 13 Although Pater avoids an Arnoldian proportioning of Hellenic and Hebraic "fourths" and "three-fourths" of life, he regards Parmenides as the initiator of a "Hebraism" of sorts which was to affect Socrates and Plato. Pater attacks the abstractionism of Parmenides, but readily concedes that it made little "claim to touch the affections" as did "the revelation to Israel"; only Cleanthes the Stoic, a Parmenidean, is able to rise above his master in his emotional "Hymn to the One," which therefore approximates "Israel's devout response to the announcement: 'the Lord thy God is one Lord' " (P&amp;P, pp. 38, 29). Similarly, in Marius, Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic, is described as "a master in Israel," whose letters have "something in common with the old Judaic unction of friendship" (I, 183, 226); Marius' vague formulation of a divinity, based on his read- ings "in Plato and others, last but not least in Aurelius," is likened to that "reasonable Ideal to which the Old Testament gives the name of Creator" (II, 68). 14 In Greek Studies and in Plato and Platonism, Pater makes it quite clear that he prefers the "delightful," multi-colored polytheism of the Greeks to a grey and "repellent DECEMBER 1962 159</page><page sequence="10">U. C. Knoepflmacher and privileged guardians" of that "catholic or general centre of Greek re- ligion" which concerned itself with the worship of Apollo, but "of Apollo in a particular development of his deity": In the dramatic business of Lacedaemon, centering in these almost liturgical dances, there was little comic acting. The fondness of the slaves for buffoonery and loud laughter, was to their master, who had no taste for the like, a reassuring note of his superiority. He therefore indulged them in it on occasion, and you might fancy that the religion of a people so strenuous, ever so full of their dignity, must have been a religion of gloom. It was otherwise. The Lacedaemonians, like those monastic per- sons of whom they so often remind one, were a very cheerful people; and the religion of which they had so much, deeply imbued everywhere with an optimism as of hope- ful youth, encouraged that disposition, was above all a religion of sanity. The ob- servant Platonic visitor might have taken note that something of that purgation of religious thought and sentiment, of its expression in literature, recommended in Plato's Republic, had been already quietly effected here, towards the establishment of a kind of cheerful daylight in men's tempers. (P&amp;P, pp. 226-227) Unlike their Athenian counterparts who worshipped Apollo "in an orgiastic, an unintellectual, or even an immoral service," Pater's proto- Christian Lacedaemonians have a "marked preference for the human element in him, for the mental powers of his being over those elemental or physical forces of production, which he also mystically represents" (pp. 228, 227). "In furtherance then of such a religion of sanity, of that harmony of functions," Pater's monastic Spartans embody in their wor- ship ideals only theoretically realized in the Platonic dialogues (p. 227). To Pater, then, it is not the "Ionian ideal" reflected in Plato's spec- ulative flights, but the ritual and form of Lacedaemon "which constitute the other ingredient in a true Hellenism, the saving Dorian soul in it" (p. 24). Pater warns the reader that "the somewhat visionary towers of Plato's Republic blend of course with those of the Civitas Dei of Augus- tine" (p. 243). Yet he praises Plato's theoretical fusion of aesthetics and ethics, and provides a lavish description of the concrete counterpart of this fusion in the Apollonian festival of the Hyacynthia, only to assert that the festival's "harmonizing" of gaiety and "significant mourning" still survive in the Christian celebration of All Souls' Day. It is obvious that Pater believes, with Ludwig Feuerbach, that religion is merely the anthropomorphic formulation of man's highest aspirations. Yet, he does not wholly share the German's Christocentric "Religion of Suffering."15 For it is the intense joyousness of the Lace- monotheism," and "its sterile, 'formless, colourless, impalpable,' eternal identity with itself' (P&amp;P, pp. 46, 47). It is this profusion of "humanized" deities which, paradox- ically enough, attracts Pater to the Roman Catholic Church (see, e.g., Marius, I, 182). 15 To Feuerbach, the essence of religion is simply the essence of feeling; the suffering Christ, who lacks "the wantonness of the Olympian gods," epitomizes the highest of VICTORIAN STUDIES 160</page><page sequence="11">PATER S RELIGION OF SANITY daemonian ritual which makes Pater think, in a more conciliatory mood, "of the novices at school in some Gothic cloister, of our own English schools, nay, of the young Lacedaemonian's cousins at Sion, singing there the law and its praises" (p. 224). In Marius it is the visible faith of the childish singers who entune a mysterious Jewish psalmody which so impresses the melancholy young Roman; in Plato and Platonism it is the "humanised" but disciplined cult of Lacedaemon which best em- bodies the sacramental nature of all human aspirations (p. 231). It is this "consciously human interest" which attracts Pater not only to Greek mythology, but also to the sacramental art of Christianity, "at least in its later though wholly legitimate developments" (pp. 216, 145).16 A ritualistic cult of form lies at the core of Pater's peculiar "re- ligion of humanity" as the only flexible means of perpetuating an har- monious belief which can withstand the relativity of time and change. But Plato and Platonism is also concerned with endowing this skeletal faith with a temper suited to its pliancy. To Pater this temper is to be found in his "independent" Platonism, a tradition which he emphati- cally distinguishes from that usually associated with Aristotle, the Schoolmen, Spinoza, Hegel, and all "those mystic aspirants to 'vision'" -"the so-called Neo-Platonists of all ages from Proclus to Schelling" (p. 193). According to Pater, "two legitimate yet divergent streams of influence" emanate from Plato and from the "environment" created by three of his forerunners - Heraclitus, Parmenides, and Pythagoras - and by Socrates, his master. Plato himself is seen as a reconciler who uni- human emotions (The Essence of Christianity [New York, 1957], p. 149). Pater like- wise regards religion as the expression of the higher emotions inherent in "human life and its familiar or exceptional incidents, birth, death, marriage, youth, age, tears, joy, rest, sleep, waking" (Miscellaneous Studies, pp. 193-194). To him the historical Jesus is also a symbol of man's triumph over "great sorrows"; but it is the adoration of the infant Jesus and not the "almost ghastly" image of the crucified and martyred Christ which impresses upon Marius the meaning of the sacrifice of "a young man" who gave up, "for the greatest of ends, the greatest of gifts" (Marius, II, 171, 138). 16 In "Winckelmann," Pater argued that the Pagan "blitheness" or "Heiterkeit" of the Greeks was a feeling far superior to the "worship of sorrow" in Christian art (Renais- sance, p. 225). This position is modified in "Demeter and Persephone" (1876), where Demeter's evolution is traced from fertility goddess to mater dolorosa. Still, Pater maintains that what has now become the Greek " 'worship of sorrow' as Goethe calls it" was emulated primarily by the painters who produced the pensive Madonnas of the Renaissance, and not by "the gloomy imagination of the middle ages" (Greek Studies, p. 11o). By Plato and Platonism even the disparagement of medievalism is omitted as Pater praises "the place occupied in Christian art by the mother and her child," and condemns Plato's abstracted selection of marriages "after the manner of those who breed birds or dogs" (p. 258), a remark not unlike those directed at Marcus Aurelius' stoic indifference at the sports of the arena. It is noteworthy that in all of these judg- ments Pater's "humanistic" standards are preserved; he has merely altered the "at- mosphere" in which he has placed them. He has become more and more sympathetic to Christianity and to its "humanized" symbols. DECEMBER 1962 161</page><page sequence="12">U. C. Knoepftmacher fled the ideas of his predecessors and held them in bond before their inevitable fragmentation by the Zeitgeist. Pater's Plato fuses the Heraclitean "doctrine of motion"- a doc- trine openly identified with "the entire modern theory of 'development'" (p. 19) - with the Parmenidean "doctrine of rest" or "the immutable" -a doctrine boldly likened to "the revelation to Israel" (p. 38). This opposition, identical to that depicted in Marius,17 bears a significant re- semblance to the standard Victorian conflict between science and re- ligion. To effect his synthesis of these rival doctrines, Pater's Plato relies on a third philosophical system, the Pythagorean "doctrine of num- ber," which is creatively associated with the ideal of Lacedaemon, al- ready described above. The doctrine of number provides Plato with the "harmony" required to unite both extremes without injury to either. This harmony is one of matter and form; it is a synthesis of the Ionian and the Doric, a "true Hellenism" which perceives and embodies in the operations of the visible world a symbol of the unseen. Plato's genius, then, consists in the magnitude of his combination, in the successful fusion of his "visual power" with his yearning for the absolute: "for him, all gifts of sense and intelligence converge in one supreme faculty of theoretic vision, Oewpia, the imaginative reason" (pp. 142, 140). III But if in Pater's pre-Christian, all-Hellenic system, Plato is re- garded as a sort of pagan St. Paul, the repository of the doctrines of all his predecessors, an Ur-visionary who holds out the promise of "the City of the Perfect, The Republic, KaXXiroXLs, Uranopolis, Utopia, Civitas Dei, The Kingdom of Heaven" all rolled into one (p. 266),18 it is Socra- tes, Plato's teacher, who corresponds to Arnold's conception of Jesus. Here again, Pater manages to stay clear of controversy by adhering to his spatial method. Arnold was forced to endow his historical Jesus with the vague attributes of "reason" and "sweetness," thus placating neither the believing Christian, nor the militant atheist. Pater, on the other hand, is able to produce an inoffensive secular "saint" who is equally acceptable to the orthodox and to the unbeliever. His Socrates, like Arnold's Christ, 17 Cf. P&amp;P, p. 48: "The ethical alliance of Heraclitus is with the Sophists and the Cyrenaics or the Epicureans; that of Parmenides with Socrates, and the Cynics or the Stoics." 18 Cf. Marius, II, 39, where Marius' readings in Plato and Aurelius arouse his yearning for "that unseen Celestial City, Uranopolis, Callipolis, Urbs Beata." VICTORIAN STUDIES 162</page><page sequence="13">PATER S RELIGION OF SANITY embodies a "peculiar religiousness" and a sense of "mission" which cul- minate, but transcend Parmenides' more "sterile" search for the "One" (pp. 99, 161, 9), just as, in the scheme of Literature and Dogma, the "sweet reasonableness" of Jesus arises from, but transcends the Hebraic belief in a "power not ourselves." But while Arnold is forced to dismiss the theological import of Christ's crucifixion and resurrection because of the discrepancies within the Gospels, Pater can fully exploit the "historic" significance of Socrates' immolation for an ideal of truth. Pointing to the detailed account of Socrates' death given in the Apology and the Phaedo, Pater can emphasize the "purely human" aspects of the philosopher's last hours and can disclaim any similarity to the "one sacred scene to which they have sometimes been compared" (p. 78). What then, is the exact meaning held by the sacrifice of Socrates? The philosopher's death, like that of Marius the Epicurean, is by no means to be regarded as an act of religious martyrdom. Pater is highly critical of the "Puritan element" in Socrates' thought (p. 145). Though accused of fabricating a "new deity" and though teaching Plato, "the sensuous lover," to become a "lover of the invisible," Socrates brings no "religion new-given," no promise of divine redemption through his self- immolation. Indeed, it is only Plato's acute "impress of visible reality," his Paterian responsiveness to his senses, which allows him to transcend his teacher's "philosophy of the unseen," the "somewhat sad-coloured school of Socrates," by blending "the material and the spiritual" into a temperate and artistic whole (pp. 128, 126, 127, 135). Like Marius, Socrates dies as a victim of the relativity of knowledge. In Pater's scheme of things, it is he who brings "philosophy from heaven to earth" by teach- ing Plato (and modern man) that he was to remain "a mere seeker after wisdom he might never attain" (pp. 81, 89). It is his earthly skepticism and not his love of the invisible which initiates the "independent" Platonism sought by Pater. Pater's Socrates thus has a dual effect on his disciple. On the negative side, his cautious morality stirs up Plato's "religious soul" and stimulates the "mystic intellectualism" of the later neo-Platonists (p. 85); on the positive side, however, his relativism, his ironic profession of ignorance, endow Plato with a means of balance: the dialectic.19 To 19 In Marius, both the negative and the positive "influences" of Socrates are evident. The "too incorporeal philosophy" which Socrates leaves behind him (P&amp;P, p. 144) finds a new expression in the contemptus mundi of the glacial Marcus Aurelius, who reflects the "ascetic pride which lurks under all Platonism" (Marius, I, 200). Socrates' wry irony, on the other hand, is personified in the figure of Lucian, who demolishes the absolutist beliefs of a would-be philosopher, Hermotimus, another of Pater's "specula- tive" young men. DECEMBER 1962 1 63</page><page sequence="14">U. C. Knoepflmacher Pater, Socrates is the initiator of the "dialogue of the mind with itself" which he, like Arnold, regards as an essential requirement for the formulation of modern thought (p. 183): The Platonic Dialogue is the literary transformation, in a word, of what was the inti- mately home-grown method of Socrates, not only of conveying truth to others, but of coming by it for himself. The essence of that method, of "dialectic" in all its forms, as its very name denotes, is dialogue, the habit of seeking truth by means of questions and answer, primarily with one's self. Just there, lies the validity of the method - in a dialogue, and endless dialogue, with one's self. (p. 177) To Pater, the Socratic dialectic of Plato is indispensable for the modern thinker who can believe in neither "the metaphysical reassertions" of religion or philosophy, nor in that "sort of certainty which is afforded by empirical science" (p. 194). The abstractions of philosophy and theology, "even under the direction of Plato," are bound to be as faulty as "the promise of 'ontological' science"; "with our modern temperament as it is," neither can offer intellectual "security" to Pater's "speculative young man." It is here, then, that "that other sort of Platonism," a Socratic relativism, comes into play (p. 195). As used by Montaigne, "a mind for which truth itself is but a possibility," the modern shape taken by the dialectic is that of the essay, which "came into use at what was really the invention of the relative, or 'modern' spirit, in the Renaissance of the sixteenth century" (p. 175).20 The "true philosophic temper" must reside, according to Pater, in a continuous act of balance and compromise, "a habit, namely of tentative thinking and suspended judgment" (p. 194). Pater's pre- sumptive reader, "the speculative young man of our own time," must learn to question the assertions of both science and metaphysics. Like Marius the Epicurean, he must somehow convert this doubt into a per- sonal creed and thus practice a faith fit for "an age which thirsts for intellectual security, but cannot make up its mind. Que scais-je? it cries in the words of Montaigne; but in the spirit also of the Platonic Socra- tes, with whom such dubitation had been nothing else than a religious duty or service" (p. 195). Negative as this exhortation may seem, Pater does not conclude Plato and Platonism with a cult of doubt. The Socratic dialectic merely 20 "If Platonism from age to age has meant, for some, ontology, a doctrine of 'being,' or the nearest attainable approach to or substitute for that; for others, Platonism has been in fact only another name for scepticism, in a recognizable philosophic tradition" (P&amp;P, p. 194). This new "spirit" and its "environment" are depicted not only in the essays which make up The Renaissance, but also in the incompleted Gaston de Latour (first published in Macmillan's in 1888), where Montaigne, a "two-sided thinker" (p. 113), impresses his relativism on a more modern Marius, Gaston, in the role taken up by Lucian in Marius. VICTORIAN STUDIES 164</page><page sequence="15">PATER S RELIGION OF SANITY yields the "temper" for a faith, and to Pater any such faith must be founded on the visible and the tangible. Unlike Marius, where Pater directs his protagonist to the "atmosphere" of a lost primitive church, and unlike Gaston de Latour where he conducts his hero to the pantheism of Giordano Bruno, the "speculative young man" of Plato and Platonism must look around him in an immediate Victorian pres- ent.21 He must feed on the sensations approved and tested by the past. It is with this dilemma in mind, that Pater turns again to The Republic and hopes to find in Plato's intense awareness of "the reality of beauty," a correlative of the "poetic religious system" of the Lacedaemonians (pp. 268, 226). IV In "Plato's Aesthetics," the final chapter of Plato and Platonism, Pater finds a corroboration for his own sensationalism in Plato's view that "men's souls are . . . the creatures of what men see and hear" (p. 271). In a world conditioned by environment, heredity, and the ever- changing flux, the only harmony that is possible among individuals must arise from the harmony of their sensations. In such a world, totally determined by phenomenal experience, the standard expressions of Vic- torian unbelief - an Arnoldian reinterpretation of the Bible as literature or a Positivist invocation of bodiless "Saints of Humanity" - are clearly impossible. It is thus in Plato's aesthetics, or rather in his subordination of aesthetics to morality, that Pater hopes to find a way to create a cor- responding Spartan "atmosphere" for his "speculative young man." With a canniness that almost seems Darwinian, Pater's Plato understood the extent to which men are dependent on their environ- ment: "Men, children, are susceptible beings, in great measure condi- tioned by the mere look of their 'medium.' Like those insects, we might fancy, of which naturalists tell us, taking colour from the plants they lodge on, they will come to match with much servility the aspects of 21 The finished Gaston de Latour would presumably also have ended in the "atmosphere" of a church, in this case, the Cathedral of Chartres. The book opens with Gaston in "Our Lady's Church"; it is safe to assume that it would have ended with the protagonist's return to this "edifice" and with his weary death: Marius must return to "White- Nights," the ancestral villa full of funerary urns, before he can succumb in an isolated hut owned by Christian peasants; Emerald Uthwart comes back to Chase Lodge in order to die in the "religious" atmosphere of his childhood; Florian Deleal returns to his father's manor-house, weary of life; Sebastian van Storck drowns in a family lodg- ing, among the "sweet relics" of his mother's faith; the Prior Saint-Jean perishes in the cell in which he has been incarcerated by his order. DECEMBER 1962 165</page><page sequence="16">[TU. C. Knoepfinacher the world about them" (p. 272). Fully aware of man's mimetic nature, Plato realized the importance of art as a guide to the perception of the ideal. Yet art, like nature, was basically immoral, an imperfect vehicle for Plato's idealism, knowing "no purpose but itself" (p. 275). Plato thus imposed a "simplification of human nature" on the founders of his Re- public: he demanded that the art of the City of the Perfect create "strictly moral effects" (pp. 273, 272). He introduced a Spartan "art of discipline" into his Utopia. To recreate this Platonic harmony, Pater's "young man," already armed with the perpetual skepticism of Socrates, is now directed to the "atmospheres" created by a disciplined past. Pater is fully aware that this harmony is artificial. But he argues that it is precisely this artifice which allowed the inhabitants of Plato's imaginary community to escape, like the Lacedaemonians, from "a certain vicious centrifugal tendency in life, in Greek and especially in Athenian life," a hedonist sort of Hellenism, permitting them instead to follow "some sacred liturgy," the discipline of Pater's "true" pre-Christian Hellenism, but the discipline also of its later Christian offshoots (p. 273). Having conducted his reader through an imaginative excursion through time and space, Pater returns to his original point of departure. Symbolic analogues fade away and the present again comes into focus. In his conclusion, Pater's "religion of sanity" is finally given its contemporary, physical locality. Its "atmosphere" becomes visible as Pater examines the disciplined art of medieval Christianity with a far greater sympathy than that shown in The Renaissance, twenty years before. Although the great Cathedrals of the Middle Ages still seem to him "a long way from the Parthenon," Pater reasons that they are after all the evolutionary end-product of "the Platonic aesthetics" (p. 279). It is Lacedaemon and not Athens, Doria rather than Ionia, moral artifice rather than unbridled sensationalism, which must be held up as ideals: Those churches of the Middle Ages have, as we all feel, their loveliness, yet of a stern sort, which fascinates while perhaps it repels us. We may try hard to like as well or better architecture of a more or less different kind, but coming back to them again we find that the secret of final success is theirs. The rigid logic of their charm controls our taste, as logic proper binds the intelligence; we would have something of that quality, if we might, for ourselves, in what we do or make; feel, under its influence, very diffident of our own loose, or gaudy, or literally insignificant, decora- tions. "Stay then," says the Platonist, too sanguine perhaps, - "Abide," he says to youth, "in these places, and the like of them, and mechanically, irresistibly, the soul of them will impregnate yours." (pp. 279-280) This then is Pater's exhortation to "youth," to the young doubter who wanders throughout his essays and "imaginary portraits": allow yourself to come under the influence of the moral environment expressly created VICTORIAN STUDIES 166</page><page sequence="17">PATER S RELIGION OF SANITY for you by ecclesiastical art and ritual; if in sympathy with its "soul," you may, like Marius, at least succumb to "its saving salt, even in ages of decadence" (p. 282). The Ruskinian bias of this exhortation is deliber- ately faint-hearted, coming as it does from a disillusioned sensationalist, yearning for a wider range of experience, but distrustful of the aestheti- cism of a Whistler or a Wilde.22 Pater thus directs his prospective Platonist to the surviving rites of the Catholic church, the only remnant of a lost "Hellenic lineage" (p. 282), offering an atmosphere full of "the positive imageries of a faith, so richly beset with persons, things, historical incidents."23 Again the tone is mildly apologetic: "The diamond, we are told, if it be a fine one, may gain in value by what is cut away. It was after such a fashion that the manly youth of Lacedaemon had been cut and carved. Lenten or monas- tic colours, brown and black, white and grey, give their utmost value for the eye (so much it is obvious) to the scarlet flower, the lighted candle, the cloth of gold" (p. 282). It is in these residual acts of faith, in a faint worship of form, that Pater's young man may hope to find "even in ages of decadence" some of the substance of Plato's fusion and thus to get "something of that irrepressible conscience of art, that spirit of control" (p. 282). Plato's reconciliation, however, remains out of reach. For his "vision," like that of the church, depends on his belief in the Immutable, a belief invalidated for Pater by the destructive Zeitgeist. In his important review of Mrs. Humphrey Ward's Robert Elsmere,24 Pater deplored the clergyman's abrupt decision to abandon institutional Christianity in order to found a Church of his own. Sup- ported by a relativism which made him quite willing to recognize Chris- tianity as a perpetual "possibility," Pater professed surprise at the ease with which Elsmere's faith was shattered by his sudden confrontation with the historical Jesus of the "Higher Criticism." Pater's comments have been attacked as being both shallow and insincere in the light of his own, quite pronounced agnosticism.25 A reading of Plato and Plato- nism will confirm, however, that there is no reason to question Pater's sincerity. In his review, reprinted in Essays from "The Guardian," Pater declared Elsmere's unbelief to be as dogmatic and unbending as ortho- 22 With an eye on the aesthetic movement, Pater warns that Plato anticipated but rejected "the modern notion" of "art for art's sake" (P&amp;P, p. 268). Pater's admonishment was truly "prophetic": he died one year before the two trials of Oscar Wilde. 23 "Sebastian van Storck," Imaginary Portraits, p. 98. The last published work during Pater's lifetime was his study of the "atmosphere" offered by the two great French Cathedrals, "Notre-Dame d'Amiens" and Vezelay (1894). 24 The Guardian, 28 Mar. 1888. 25 Cf.

Knoepflmacher dox belief: "had he possessed a perfectly philosophic or scientific temper he would have hesitated" (p. 67). Plato and Platonism represents Pater's own hesitant endeavor to provide such a temper for the young "Elsmeres" of his time. By convincing these doubters to stay within the physical confines of a traditional church, Pater hoped to preserve a more flexible faith than the drab Socialist Christianity preached by Robert Elsmere: "it is the infinite nature of Christ which has led to such diversi- ties of genius in preaching as St. Francis, and Taylor, and Wesley" ("The Guardian," p. 69). In the final lines of Plato and Platonism Pater casts a longing look at the "Greek clay" safely stored in the British Museum as a still visible "correlative" of Plato's unattainable fusion (P&amp;P, p. 283). Wearily, he prescribes "patience, 'infinite patience,'" for all those who are tempera- mentally unable to accept the philosopher's invisible world of ideas or the equivalent "promises" of Christianity (pp. 283, 264). The same air of fatigue and satiety which prevails in the conclusion of Marius perme- ates the end of Pater's last work, as his "speculative" young pupil, like Marius, is forced to seek shelter in a compound of ritual and skepticism. As Pater possibly realized, it is on his deliberate avoidance of meta- physics that this compound and the supporting framework of Plato and Platonism rest and ultimately fall. His "religion of sanity" is the product of a reduction. Pater's refusal to consider the validity of Plato's "vision," his adroit circumscription of the foundations of Christian belief, and his non-theological line of inquiry give him the desired flexibility to endow his young doubter with a cult of feeling, approved and confirmed by the convolutions of the Zeitgeist. Yet, despite his imaginative enlistment of the historical method for the redefinition of a humanist tradition, Pater rebuilds only in order to eliminate and to exclude. Plato and Platonism is above all an exercise in tasteful selection, that "faculty of choosing and rejecting" so vividly described in the essay on "Style" as an artistic act of arriving at a preconceived unity of design (Appreciations, p. 26). Paradoxically enough, Pater's most "public" utterance is ultimately confounded by its preciosity. The creed it tries to formulate becomes far more frail and exclusive than the humanist "faiths" of other Victorian thinkers. Forever dependent on the impres- sions of the individual, Pater's "religion of sanity" is perhaps the least comprehensive, but also the most intimate of all the personal cults of Victorian unbelief.
