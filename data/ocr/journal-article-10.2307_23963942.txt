The long shadow cast by Wilhelm Bousset over the study of the figure of the Antichrist may soon be dispelled by a new light. Gregory Jenks's doctoral dissertation for the University of Queensland, the new light breaking on to the horizon, may not burn as brightly nor hold sway for as long (nearly a full century) as did the seminal work of Bousset, but it should at least serve to redefine the contours of the landscape. Bousset had welcomed Gunkel's assumption that esoteric, oral,</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 653 eschatological traditions passed almost unchanged across the mil lennia, leaving only occasional and fragmentary deposits in surviv ing literature. He considered he had breathed life into this assumption by his commanding proposal that a fairly uniform, unwritten Antichrist myth (which he regarded as a pre-Christian, anthropomorphic transformation of the Babylonian Sea-Monster myth) existed prior to and alongside its expressions in early Chris tian writings. He thus tended to treat the full Antichrist myth, as expressed in several fourth-century Christian authors, as some thing which could be read back into much earlier texts. Jenks, after reviewing the 'Bousset-Charles consensus' on the Antichrist, joins its hitherto only mildly successful critics in calling its method into question. He describes his own procedure as follows: The writings of the third century ce which clearly speak of the Antichrist myth are taken, as a whole, to serve as the basis for a paradigm of the Antichrist myth in its earliest explicit forms. This paradigm then serves as a model while earlier Jewish and Christian writings are studied to see what connection, if any, there may have been between these older texts usually described as Antichrist passages and the third century form of the myth (p. 25). Then, while allowing that various earlier elements—Jewish, Christian, and pagan—went into the formula for 'the Antichrist myth', Jenks argues that only those traditions 'which occur in a messianic context and portray an evil human being pretending to the messianic office or opposing Jesus' (p. xvi) should be labelled examples of this Antichrist myth. Thus Jenks is able to reduce the corpus of texts which can be said to belong to this category and thus he is able to deliver the important conclusion that there is 'no evidence of a Jewish concept of an Antichrist figure' in Jewish apocalyptic literature between c.200 bc and the first century ad (p. 193). But such well-earned success can lead to overzeal, and Jenks at times seems to sail perilously close to the other edge with his own method. Should we, he asks, include as representations of the Antichrist myth early texts which may contain 'elements familiar from their use in the Antichrist myth' but which do not use the word Antichrist or which 'antedate the development of the precise term' (pp. 12-13)? Bousset, of course, answered with an enthusi astic yes, but Jenks says no, and attempts to account for elements which resemble the full Antichrist 'myth' of the late second and early third centuries in other ways. But the drawbacks of this approach should also be apparent. Did nobody believe in the Trinity before the word 'Trinity' was coined? Or, more to the point, did nobody believe in an Endtyrant (see below) before the</page><page sequence="3">654 REVIEWS word 'Endtyrant' was coined? In the end, however, Jenks does allow that Didache 16, which does not employ the word 'Antichrist', contains 'to all intents and purposes . . . the earliest complete statement of the Antichrist myth' (p. 311) and that the Testament of Hezekiah (Ascension of Isaiah iii. 13 - iv. 22), which also does not use the word, seems to present 'an eschatological adversary that was virtually identical with the more developed Antichrist myth in the late second century' (p. 327). After providing a topical summary of 'the Antichrist myth' in third-century Christian authors Jenks searches for antecedents which contributed to the growth of that myth. These include, among others, traditions about demonic powers, the figure of Antiochus IV, false teachers, Endtyrant figures (the only unam biguous, pre-Christian example of which occurs, interestingly, in the book of Daniel), persecution of the elect, and ambivalent attitudes towards the Roman empire. Then Jenks helps us to picture the gradual convergence of the strands of Antichrist teach ing both in New Testament writings and in Jewish and Christian literature before ad 175, the time of Irenaeus, when the Antichrist tradition has finally come into its own. The book contains no less than thirty-three useful charts tabu lating everything from sources used by Bousset, to significant events and literature 200 bce to 70 ce, to the Nero-Beliar Figure in Testament of Hezekiah. No index is provided, however, and a larger list of abbreviations is also greatly missed. Instead the reader is referred to other sources, one of which is TRE, whose full form, ironically, is never given. More seriously, the work should have had another rigorous proofreading: far too many typographical errors have survived, along with not a few redund ancies, especially congregating for some reason around pp. 298-300. One must expect differences of opinion in the dating of some of the many texts with which Jenks has to deal. Only the apparent dating of the pseudo-Ignatian epistle to the Philippians to the late second century (p. 50 n. 4) occasions any real surprise. The reader should also be made aware that two citations from Victorinus' commentary on Revelation are really from Jerome's altered edition of it. The citation on p. 88, completely absent from Victorinus, has the Antichrist occupying the 'little season' of Rev. 20: 3, after the millennium. This could not have been the view of Victorinus, who was a chiliast and therefore believed that the Antichrist would rise and fall before the beginning of the millen nium. Again at pp. 92-3, the notice of the Greek Antemos and the Gothic Gensericos as possible names for the Antichrist comes from Jerome, not from Victorinus.</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 655 Because the Qumran texts are not found to be teeming with relevant material for the Antichrist tradition it might seem that Jenks's extended treatment of them (pp. 135—52) is not justified. But their value lies in their potential for refuting Bousset and Charles, who 'each suggested that the Belial myth had developed so far along the lines of a demonic Endtyrant. . . that earlier occurrences of Belial could be linked with an oral form of a pre Christian Jewish Antichrist myth' (p. 152). Jenks has demon strated, mainly from the Qumran scrolls, that 'the primary signi ficance of Belial in many Jewish circles around the turn of the eras was that of a Satan figure—so much so that "Belial" displaces "Satan" entirely in the Qumran texts' (p. 152). The most debatable parts of the book occur, in this reviewer's opinion, in the author's handling of the main New Testament sources. Jenks is surely correct in denying the presence of an individualized Antichrist figure in the Olivet discourse (pp. 201-4), though the prediction of 'false Christs', as Jenks notes, soon became closely wedded to the Antichrist tradition. But when we come to 2 Thessalonians (which Jenks accepts as Pauline), the book of Revelation (to which he assigns an early date before ad 70) and to a lesser extent the Johannine epistles, Jenks has left ample room to argue with his reluctance to acknowledge in these texts an incipient but bona fide Antichrist tradition. The telltale sign of an Antichrist myth which, according to Jenks, is missing from the New Testament texts seems to be the explicit representation of the evil human figure as a parody or an opponent of Christ. Jenks recognizes in 2 Thess. 2 'the more general idea of an evil figure, an Endtyrant modelled on the historical figure of Antiochus IV and influenced by the portrayal of Antiochus in Daniel' (p. 44). Concerning the Man of Sin and his claim to divine prerogatives, it is hard to feel the force of Jenks's statement that 'these divine claims highlight the point that Paul's Rebel is not an "Antichrist" but an opponent of God' (p. 221). Why the claim to divine honours could not be regarded as proper to the early form of an Antichrist figure, particularly if the conception was formed in contrast to the Christ who was known to Paul (see 1 Thess. 1: 1; 3: 11; 2 Thess. 1: 1, 2, 12; 2: 16; 3: 5, 16), is not made sufficiently plain. This is true particularly because the figure exhibits certain other commonly acknowledged (even by Jenks himself, p. 222) correspondences to Jesus. Likewise, for Rev. 13, Jenks quotes Beasley-Murray's impress ive list of parallels between Christ and the beast from the sea but surprisingly does not go on to rebut them, choosing to discuss instead (possible) sources for the imagery. On the beast from the</page><page sequence="5">656 REVIEWS earth in Rev. 13: 11, a 'deliberate contrast' is admitted between Christ the Lamb and the beast who has 'two horns like a lamb'. But the significance of this is that 'it would tend to undermine the traditional interpretation of the first beast as an Antichrist figure' (p. 245, cf. a similar statement on p. 252). But why is this? Does the Antichrist myth also dictate that there be only one figure who can simulate any attribute of the Messiah? In seeking to dissociate Revelation's contribution from other developments of the Antichrist idea Jenks says that Revelation's focus on a foe external to the Church is 'so rarely observed in other Antichrist writings of any era'. This is an astonishing state ment. Despite the fact that the terms 'Antichrist' and 'antichrists' were applied derivatively to ecclesiastical opponents, the primary significance of 'the Antichrist' for Irenaeus, Hippolytus, Vic torinus, et alia, even for Tertullian and Cyprian, was surely that of an external adversary—whether originating from the tribe of Dan or from the line of the Caesars. Jenks's caution with regard to the Johannine epistles may strike one as more justifiable because, 'most (if not all) of the ideas associated with the Antichrist myth in later literature are assumed [by other scholars] to be implicit in the occurrence of the mere word in 1 and 2 John. This dramatic hermeneutical leap entails a considerable degree of "eisegesis", and a large dash of argument from silence' (p. 341). But can we so confidently make another type of jump from the admission that 'the epistles did not set out to give direct instruction on the topic of the Antichrist', to 'it is clear that the Johannine epistles were not working with a form of the Antichrist myth which was even as developed as that seen in the Didache' (pp. 345-6)? If it was not the intent of the author of the Johannine epistles to spell out in detail his understanding of the Antichrist, we obviously cannot be sure that he was not working with a much more developed form of the Antichrist doctrine. By the time of John's epistles a figure known already to his readers as the Antichrist (whether the term had been invented by this author or not), as well as something called the spirit of Antichrist, could be mentioned in such a facile and almost routine manner by him, that he could immediately turn from these stock ideas to apply them anew to his readers' present situation. One wishes, in particular, for more exploration of John's play on the words χρίσμα, Χριστός and αντίχριστος in 1 John 2: 18-27. Christians are 'chrismed' ones, or (though John does not use the term), 'christs'. False Christians (at least the ones John is dealing with) are therefore antichrists. The many antichrists stand over against the many christs addressed in the epistle. It may even be</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS 657 that the former are thus prepared to fall prey to the 'deception' of the Antichrist when at last he 'comes'. If even here we are in danger of outrunning the evidence, there is also a danger of lagging behind it. John's conception could hardly have been totally unre lated to the notions which come to expression in Testament of Hezekiah and the Didache, even if we cannot be sure which ele ments might have been known to him and to his first readers. The weaknesses identified here might be amended or defended without injury to the obvious importance of Jenks's work. His is the first rejection of Bousset's thesis to be carried out on a grand scale in full awareness of the massive evidence, some of which was unavailable to Bousset and Charles. Bousset's monumental attempt to bind the Antichrist idea to ancient, mythic Sea-Monster traditions (Jenks does not deny a connection, he only makes it a more remote one, and only one among others) and thus to speak of the Antichrist legend as a pre-Christian, Jewish legend which passed secretly, 'hand to hand', through the lore of vast genera tions held the field for over nine decades. Will Jenks's book finally slay the Bousset theory with the breath of its mouth, or will it only inflict a mortal wound from which the theory will yet recover, so that men will again follow it with wonder and receive its mark? This reviewer anticipates more lasting results to follow from Jenks's studv. Charles Ε. Hill</page></plain_text>
