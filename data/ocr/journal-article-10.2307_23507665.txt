<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Mandaeans and Heterodox Judaism DAN COHN-SHERBOK University of Kent, Canterbury, England Recently there has been considerable discussion about the connection between Judaism and the Mandaean religion. Some scholars argue that the Mandaeans had their origin in heterodox Judaism; others stress affinities with other religious traditions. On the basis of rabbinic evidence which has been neglected in this discussion, it is possible to find support for the conten tion that Judaism and Mandaeism were interconnected. In rabbinic literature of the tannaitic and amoraic periods Jewish heretical groups (miiiim) are often mentioned. In several texts they are described as believing in the doctrine of a heavenly Adam who is a co-partner with God in creation. Assuming that in these sources the rabbis had a single heresy in mind, it is quite possible that they are referring to the predecessors of the present-day Mandaeans who subscribed to a similar belief. Such an identifica tion would point to a genetic relationship between Judaism and the Man daean religion. For some time a number of scholars have recognized a connection between Judaism and the Mandaean religion. In 1925 M. Lidzbarski located the beginnings of Mandaeism in the Christian period in Syria-Palestine. According to him the ancestors of the present day Man daeans were originally situated in the Trans-Jordan and had their spirit ual home in the heterodox circles of Judaism.1 In 1940 S. Pederson argued that Mandaeism had at one time a positive relation to Judaism and therefore contains numerous Jewish elements.2 Following Brandt3 G. Widengren in 1961 expressed the opinion that the earliest structure of Mandaeism is of Jewish origin.4 Similarly, in The Secret Adam, pub lished in i960, Lady Drower stressed the connections between Mandaeism and Judaism, drawing a few parallels between gnostic ideas (1) M.

Rudolph6 and G. Scholem7 argued along similar lines. Other scholars however have rejected this view. In 1926 S.A. Pallis advanced that the Mandaeans were not of Jewish origin and derived their knowledge of Jewish names and ideas only at a very late date through the Quran.8 In Church and Gnosis published in 1932 F.C. Burkitt noted that the Mandaeans were acquainted with the Syriac Peshitta and had affinities with Marcionism and Manichaeism.9 More recently E.M. Yamauchi maintained that Mandaeism was non-Jewish with western and eastern Proto-Mandaean components.10 Thus it is clear that there is considerable scholarly disagreement about the origins of the Mandae ans. However on the basis of rabbinic discussions of Jewish heretical groups, it is possible to see a connection between a central belief in the Mandaean religion and one of the heretical doctrines the rabbis were anxious to condemn, so suggesting that the Mandaeans were a splinter group from Hellenistic Judaism. In rabbinic literature of the tannaitic and amoraic periods there is fre quent mention of Jewish heretics who are referred to as 'minim'. In the early part of this century various scholars argued that the minim were the members of a single group. In Christianity in the Talmud and Midrash, for example, R. Travers Herford maintained thatmmm were Christians.11 S. Rubin, on the other hand, identified them as Manichaeans.12 Eventually, however, most scholars have come to the view that the term minim minim was used by the Rabbis to refer to a number of sectarian groups. As A. Segal notes in his recent study Two Powers in Heaven: "A variety of Jewish sectarian groups fell heir to the rabbinic designation min. Depending on the context and epoch in which the specific tradition arose, min could refer to Samaritan, Saducee, gnostic, Judeo-Christian, and many others."13 Among the passages in rabbinic literature where the minim are described as believing in various doctrines, there are several texts where (5) E.S.

Thus in Tosefta Sanhédrin we read: "Our Rabbis taught: 'Adam was created on the eve of the Sab bath. And why? So that the minim could not say: The Holy one Blessed be He, had a partner in his work of creation.'"14 Again in Genesis Rabba the rabbis warn that it is a mistake to believe that Adam is a divine créa ture: R. Hoshaya said: 'When the Holy One, Blessed be He, created Adam, the ministering angels mistook him and wished to exclaim "holy" before him. What does this resemble? A King and a governor who sat in a chariot and his subjects wished to say to the king "sovereign," but they did not know which it was. What did the king do? He pushed the gov ernor out of the chariot so they knew who was king. Similarly, when the lord created Adam, the angels mistook him. What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do? He caused a deep sleep to fall upon him. So all knew him. So all knew that he was man; thus it is written, 'cease ye from man, in whose nostrils is a breath, for how little is he to be accounted'" (Isa. 2.22).15 Assuming that in these sources the rabbis had a single heresy in mind, it is possible they were referring to the precursors of the present-day Mandaeans. There are, of course, references to a cosmic Adam in rab binic literature,16 but he is not conceived of as a divine partner in créa tion. Rather, it is in Mandaic texts that such a notion is fully developed. In Mandaeism, the primal Adam (Adam Qadmaia) is depicted as the macrocosmos; he is the cosmos in human shape. In the Alf Trisar Suialia the letters of the alphabet play an instrumental role in his formation,17 a notion in all likelihood derived from Jewish mysticism18: "The 'L' came into being — and up to the 'La' there were twelve. And for the halfway 'La' unto the end of the living it was twelve, because they divided that well in which there are four corners. Thus its counterpart which pertaineth to it, which is named 'L', is seen to be the middle of the alpha bet. When they were 'H' the mysteries expressed themselves defectively but encouraged themselves saying, 'If we separate ourselves and place ourselves at a distance one from the other the building will not hold (14) Tosefta, Sanh. 8.7. (15) Gen. R., 8.10. (16) In Sanh. 38 f. for example, R. Meir implies that Adam represents all creation by saying that the dust to make him was taken from every place on earth. R. Judah states in the name of Rab that Adam had cosmic dimensions at first. (17) Alf Trisar Suialia, pp. 181 f.

If we approach one another and merge together we shall con struct the building soundly and will set it in orderly fashion.'"19 As in rabbinic sources Primal Adam is a vast shape embracing all that is to exist in the cosmos.20 His Cosmic body (stuna) in which he appears in the AlfTrisarthe AlfTrisar Suialia and other texts is immaterial in as much as it is the ideal counterpart of the universe, yet it possesses organs like those in man: "The head is one world, the breast one world and each leg a world: yea even unto liver, spleen, bowels, stomach, male organ, womb, skin, hair, nails, back and viscera, each one of them is a separate world."21 True to this macrocosm-microcosm pattern, the earth too has an anthropomorphic shape: "The earth is a body, and air the soul therein. Its sproutings are bones, rivers veins, blood the ocean. . . ."22 Primordial man is thus a divine cosmic being, the source of all things, and the ideal pattern of both man and the earth. It may well be that it is this doctrine of a Heavenly Adam who is responsible for all creation which was the target of rabbinic polemic in the Hellenistic period. If this is so, then it may be that the Mandaeans were one of the Jewish heretical sects included under the general cate gory of minim in rabbinic literature. Given this identification, a possible reconstruction of Mandaean origins would be as follows: In the Helle nistic period the Jewish community was divided into a number of groups with different orientations. Within mainstream Judaism there were some rabbis who subscribed to mystic doctrines such as the instrumental role of the Hebrew alphabet in creation and the concept of Cosmic Adam. It seems likely that other Jews were influenced by these ideas yet took them a stage farther, conceiving of Adam as a partner in the créa tion of the world. For the rabbis such a notion was heretical; it was criti cized in rabbinic literature and those who subscribed to this belief were branded heretics — minim — along with other Jews who held different, equally abhorent opinions. These heretical Jews were the ancestors of the Mandaeans, and as is recorded in the Haran Gawaita they appear to have left Jerusalem to escape persecution. Such a reconstruction of events is in line with Lady Drawer's view that "after the destruction of Jerusalem, when Jewish Christians for the most part settled in East Jordan, our Nasoreans (Mandaeans), hating, and hated by, both Jew and Jewish Christian, would naturally seek harbour (1g) Alf Trisar Suialia, pp. 181 f.

As Yamauchi points out, the Mandaean religion and Judaism do differ at several points,24 but this is surely to be expected since Mandaeism has been subject to countless influences over nearly two millenia. What is of consequence are the obvi ous Jewish features within Mandaeistn which point to its possible rela tionship to Judaism. (23) Lady Drower, op. cit., xi. (24) E.
