<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tamburlaine the Great and The Spanish Tragedy: the Genesis of a Tradition by Thomas McAlindon 1. Conspicuous in English Renaissance tragedy is a tendency to conceive of the tragic as a process of sudden, extreme change involving the clash and confusion of contraries, the ideal or pre-tragic state being understood as a bond of opposites. The more obvious effects of this twin idea are easily summarized. Tragic protagonists are regularly presented as creatures of "im- possible mixtures" who vividly exemplify the maxim that "none can be always one."' They may oscillate between opposite emotional and behavior- al extremes, or they will become their own antitheses in an arresting process of self-loss and self-betrayal.' The spectacle of extreme change and instability in the protagonists often generates feelings of bewilderment in the observer (both on- and off-stage), yet such feelings are more characteristic of the protagonists' own experience of tragic reality. Suddenly finding themselves in a labyrinthine world where everyone and everything contradicts their in- stinctive expectations and where they are driven by forces they may not understand to defy their better nature or chosen principles, they move through a state of profound confusion in the direction of madness itself. Although psychologically simple by contrast, villainous characters are often presented in contrary terms too. Their function is to entangle the noble in the dualities of their own nature and of the world at large, and they are characterized accordingly as personifications in outward appearance of everything they essentially are not They seem truthful, loyal, kindly, and courteous -evangelists of unity and concord.3 With its stark contrasts in the shape and sequencing of scenes, dramatic construction frequently serves to reinforce these patterns of character and experience. So too do certain symbolic actions and motifs which rapidly became conventionalized in the Renaissance. By far the most important of these is the scene of the treacherous entertainment (as I shall call it), that ritual affirmation of love, peace, and unity-often associated with a marriage-which quickly proves to be a masque for hatred and destruction.4 Functioning always as a complete model of its imaginative environment, the 59</page><page sequence="2">6o HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY treacherous entertainment epitomizes a world of broken bonds in which the accepted meaning of rites and symbols is lost or inverted, language is infected with ambiguity and contradiction, and the sword forever threatens to replace the tongue as the characteristic instrument of civilized man. Less memorable theatrically, but almost as valuable for an understanding of tragic contrariety, are the rituals and symbols associated with the regene- rative process signaled at the end of many plays. Change, confusion, and dis- cord here give way in some measure to steadfastness, clarification, and con- cord. The protagonists face the ultimate change with perfect constancy, at one with their nobler selves and with the fate they may have striven to avoid. They may also die at one ("exchanging forgiveness") with the instruments of that fate, or reconsecrating a sacred personal bond, or inspiring survivors of the conflict to draw together in a solemn commitment to unity and peace. Their achievement of coming to terms with fate- accepting the worst calmly if not positively embracing it- generates two very popular hyperboli- cal paradoxes which are particularly illuminating here, for they postulate a harmony of those very opposites whose confusion provides the commonest symbols of tragic woe and wonder on the Renaissance stage: violence is re- ceived as a welcome guest, a bringer of true peace, and funeral grief modu- lates into a strange wedding joy.5 Symptomatic as it is of an underlying rhythm which is both cyclical and dialectical, this unfolding of change-for- the-better out of change-for-the-worse constitutes a real threat to the inten- sity of tragic endings in the period.6 However, although the threat sometimes materializes (and is connected with the rise of tragi-comedy at the end of Shakespeare's career), the final adumbration of unity and harmony is always managed in the best plays in such a way as to modify only slightly the dominant impression of a world which has fallen under the curse of Timon: "Decline to your confounding contraries/And let confusion live.f7 Behind this tradition of tragic contrariety, forming a kind of imaginative and philosophical matrix, lies the anthropomorphic conception of nature as a dynamic system of interacting, interdependent opposites - the four qualities, elements, and humors. According to the old cosmology, it will be recalled, the inherent antagonism of the opposites (nature as egoism and strife) is kept in check and assimilated to a process of "concordant discord" by means of a binding force which is at once justice and love (nature as partnership and law). The balance, harmony, or "well-tempered" mixing of the opposites is the condition of full and enduring life, their unchecked strife the cause of all decay and death in nature. The former ensures that change will be regulated or timely ("natural"), part of a stable process; the latter is productive of change which is both sudden and extreme, with one opposite eclipsing the next in a condition comparable to primal chaos.8 Except at the close of the sixteenth century, Renaissance tragedians were not noticeably explicit in establishing a connection between this cosmic philosophy and the multiple oppositions</page><page sequence="3">TAMBURLAINE THE GREAT AND THE SPANISH TRAGEDY and confusions of their own play-worlds. In this area, however, the danger for the seventeenth-century dramatist was a laboring of the obvious rather than excessive reticence: adequate reminders of the relevant frame of reference could be supplied through elemental imagery, humoral reference, or implicit allusion to the ancient tradition of marriage and dance as symbols of cosmic unity-in-contrariety.9 If to approach Renaissance tragedy in this manner is to call up the tired ghost of "the Elizabethan world picture,' it is also to suggest that that picture may not have been fully implicated in most historicist accounts of Elizabe- than drama in the first place. It has been customary to assume that the essential feature of pre-modern cosmology as understood by the Elizabe- thans was the principle of hierarchical correspondence (or analogy). But in the "theoria of the world" which the Elizabethans inherited from the Middle Ages and the Greeks, polarity was a principle of at least equal importance with that of correspondence; and of the two, polarity may have had the more significant influence on their tragic drama.10 Whereas the notion of the uni- verse as a system of hierarchical correspondences presents itself to the imagi- nation as a straightforward model of order and stability, and induces a mood of philosophic confidence and optimism in any consideration of the human condition, the idea of the universe as a system of opposites can have quite dif- ferent effects. For it speaks to the imagination not only of order but also of the fragile and impermanent nature of life's harmonious patterns; and since subject and object are held to be always duplex and subject to change, it speaks too of a radical uncertainty in every attempt to interpret and evaluate man's nature and experience. Viewed in the light of this cosmic model, unity- and all that it entails in terms of order and intelligibility- may seem no more than the effect of a truce in a never-ending war. It was perhaps inevitable, therefore, that Renaissance tragedians should exploit the contrari- ous model of man and universe. Beginning as they did with the medieval tragic idea of man as the victim of an inherently treacherous world (governed by the goddess Fortune), and adjusting it to their own conviction that he is betrayed also by the conditions of his nature, they created a complex and comprehensive view of the tragic to which the notion of universal contrariety contributed both as stimulus and validation. Remarkably, the Renaissance tradition of tragic polarity does not evolve in gradual fashion. Rather, it makes an emphatic start in Marlowe's Tamburlaine the Great (1587-8) and Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy (c.1585-90), its essential constituents being deployed there in boldly formalized designs which no Eli- zabethan audience could fail to perceive and appreciate. Given the wealth of scholarly investigation into the development of medieval and sixteenth-cen- tury drama in the last few decades, one is necessarily hesitant about locating the origin of anything in either of these two plays. In particular, it has to be acknowledged here- following the appearance of Joel B. Altman's The Tudor</page><page sequence="4">62 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY Play of Mind (Berkeley, 1978)-that a tendency to play with opposites in the spirit of intellectual inquiry is noticeable in comedy and tragedy alike before Marlowe and Kyd. However, the roots of this dialectical propensity are in the habits engendered by rhetorical disputation, and not in a metaphy- sical and scientific doctrine which postulates that nature itself is a system of opposites. Thus it is impossible to find in extant plays which antedate The Spanish Tragedy and Tamburlaine any attempt to relate the tragic process, and all the uncertainties it generates in victim and beholder alike, to the prin- ciple of universal contrariety. One might have expected to encounter just such an attempt in the learned Gorbudoc (1561), where tragic violence and change are identified with the undoing of unity, but no trace of it can be seen there. Indeed to discover anything in imaginative literature comparable to the grand dualistic vision of Marlowe and Kyd, one has to go out of the drama altogether and back to the first and most ambitious of The Canterbury Tales: like the early Shakespeare, Marlowe and Kyd seem to have been deeply impressed by the superbly contrarious art of this tragi-comical romance."1 In their adaptation of the metaphysics of polarity to the tragic vision, Tamburlaine and The Spanish Tragedy are, then (it would seem), wholly original; thus the account which follows here of the ways in which that adaptation is accom- plished may be taken as fresh evidence in favor of the somewhat old- fashioned view that the history of Renaissance tragedy as a complex and effective art properly begins with these two plays. It is not, however, my intention to deny that they are strikingly different plays, or to suggest that they create an archetypal pattern to which most Renaissance tragedies con- form. My concern rather is with their introduction to tragedy of a seminal concept capable of being used in a variety of ways and in combination with other concepts of major importance. 2. The central position given to the myth of Mars and Venus in the symbolic structure of both plays allows us to pinpoint their philosophical affinity in a particularly concrete manner. The two divinities do not serve simply as sym- bols for ideas about love, beauty, valor, and honor in the life of the hero. As in The Knight's Tale, they stand as well for the contrary forces of love and strife which pervade all nature. In fact both dramatists are at pains to im- plicate in their thematic pattern the well-known interpretation of the union of Mars and Venus, and the birth therefrom of the goddess Harmonia, as an allegory of the universal process of discordia concors.12 It has long been assumed, of course, that the mythological figure who makes most sense of Tamburlaine's amazing character is Hercules (especially as interpreted by the Stoic Seneca)."3 I would contend, however, that the essential function of the allusions to Hercules is to provide appropriate local</page><page sequence="5">TAMBURLAINE THE GREAT AND THE SPANISH TRAGEDY 63 refinements and variations on the martial paradigm. Allusions to the god of war are far more numerous than to Hercules; there are several passages refer- ring to the Mars/Venus relationship; and the imaginative effect of these allusions is greatly extended by the play's rich complex of astrological thought and expression, all tending to connect if not to identify the 'aspect' and "influence" of the leading characters with that of planetary divinities. In- deed the whole imaginative design of the play- parts 1 and 2-is firmly tied to the Mars/Venus myth. The centrality of this myth is indicative of the fact that Marlowe attends very seriously to heroic relationships as well as to heroic singularity. He pre- sents Tamburlaine as a hero whose unique greatness lies in his possession of fundamental yet contrary attributes wrought to an extreme pitch in himself and in his relations with others, and held together for the most part in a dazzling, contrapuntal harmony which echoes the concordant discord of the universe. To put this in structural terms, part I is a heroic play where greatness is achieved through a rare binding of opposites; part 2 is a tragic drama where untimely death and the impoverishment of the human stage follows from the partial fracturing of that bond. The two plays are self- sufficient but interrelated parts of the one monodrama and are shaped by the same controlling ideas. The two word-concepts consistently used to designate Tamburlaine's greatness -'majesty' and "resolution'- both confirm that its basis is in con- trarious unity. Tamburlaine's majesty attracts and daunts, his frowning lofty brows figuring death, "And in their smoothness amitie and life' (pt. 1,2.1.461- 84; cfpt2,3.5.3662-7). His resolution postulates a marriage of word and deed, tongue and sword, persuasion and conquest, the arts of peace and of war. Both qualities show too that the essential components of his nature are wrath and love. The famous ritual of the three colors (modeled on the unfolding of the divine wrath in Revelation 6.1-5) demonstrates the full implications of the two qualities and constitutes in effect a perfect ritual of self-definition.'4 Those who respond to the Agentle flags of amitie" (pt.1,4.2.1556), accepting him as the man of natural superiority that he manifestly is, are assured that he will act as a "louing Conqueror" (pt.1,5.1.4140); those who wait until the red or black flags appear unleash his fury and are promised partial and total destruction respectively. Tamburlaine's fidelity to the terms of this covenant shows that he can be as pitiless to the subjects of the unwise as to the unwise themselves. But it also shows that he is a creature of bonds in the full sense, one who limits his actions to a code of "martiall iustice" (pt2,4.1.3 770) and who at the same time would resolve conquest into friendship. Tamburlaine's relationship with Zenocrate-the play's Venus-figure-is conceived as the summation of all his creative relationships. That her charac- ter should be so indistinct is, therefore, an imaginative defect of some magni- tude. Nevertheless, her importance to an understanding of Tamburlaine's</page><page sequence="6">64 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY character and fate is emphasized by means of construction, staging, stage imagery, and verbal imagery, as well as by his own declarations and by the motivation of the action. Thus in each part he makes his first appearance in her company (conversing on matters amorous and martial). Part 1 ends with her coronation by him and his friends, an act which fulfills a promise made to her in their first dialogue. Part 2 ends with his dying request that her embalmed body be placed at his side, and so with their joint-burial (and, by implication, their eternal union) in accord with the assurance made at her deathbed: "And till I die thou shalt not be interr'd.iThen in a tomb as rich as Mausolus,/We both will rest and haue one Epitaph" (2.3.3100-12). In the imagery Tamburlaine is regularly identified with fire and Zenocrate with water. This reflects their dominant psychological characteristics (anger and gentleness, cruelty and pity) and their status as incarnations of Mars and Venus. But it also invokes the whole idea of an original, life-giving union of contraries which the Mars/Venus myth had come to symbolize- what Ovid refers to in his well-known account of the creation of things in the Metamorphoses (1.429-33): 'Fire and water are always opposites, yet moist heat is the source of everything, and this discordant harmony is suited to creation." Tamburlaine himself declares his dependence on Zenocrate when, in their first encounter, he consecrates his future and all his "martiall prises" to her, as- serting that her person "is more woorth to Tamburlaine,/Than the possession of the Persean Crowne,/Which gratious starres haue promist at my birth" (1.2.285-301). This assertion is not to be taken as a mere show of eloquence. Rather it implies a recognition on his part that her gracioius aspect and influ- ence are as necessary as the stars to the fulfilment of his heroic destiny: that their encounter is analogous to what happened at the moment of his birth when "Heauen did affoord a gratious aspect,/And ioin'd those stars that shall be opposite,/Euen till the dissolution of the world" (pt.2,3.5.3582-4). In practical terms her influence on him is twofold: she inspires his martial strivings, yet moderates them; adds more courage to his conquering mind, but calms the fury of his sword (pt.1,5.2.2219,2297). And of the two kinds of influence the second is the more important, since its presence accounts for the nature of the denoument in part I and its absence for the catastrophe in part 2.15 As is regularly observed, the only inner conflict Tamburlaine experiences is when Zenocrate pleads with him to restrain his fury against Damascus and make his victory over her father a "gentle" one (pt.1,5.2.2180). An important clue to the significance of this incident is the almost simultaneous pleading of the tearful virgins of Damascus. Their complete failure to "qualifie" his "hot extreames" (1827) not only provides a perfect example of his strict fidelity to the code of martial justice, it also serves as a foil for his eventual surrender to the tears of Zenocrate on her father's behalf Sent to him by a foolishly</page><page sequence="7">TAMBURLAINE THE GREAT AND THE SPANISH TRAGEDY 65 obstinate governor who should have acted when Mars and Venus were truly in conjunction (that is, when the gentle flags of amity were displayed by the invincible conqueror), the virgins are treated here as poor substitutes for "the loue of Venus" when she seeks to pacify "the angrie God of Armes" (2.1902-9). By contrast, Tamburlaine confesses that Zenocrate's 'flowing eies" and "watery cheeks" lay "more siege unto my soule,iThan all my Army to Damascus Walles," and accepts that she "deserues a conquest ouer euery hart' (2.1920-37,1989). And in thus granting her the role of Venus vic- trix, he is not being inconsistent."6 His surrender is the assertion of another part of his own nature and is justified by the fact that it does not undo a sworn commitment. Since he has refused to spare Damascus, he can claim that "the God of war resignes his roume to me" even when he is in the act of sparing and enlarging the Soldan; and at the same time Zenocrate can refer (with an apt blend of ambiguity and paradox) to "my conquering Loue" (2.2232,2224). The destruction of Damascus and the enlarging of the Soldan imply a perfect balance and fusion of opposites and are appropriately followed by the crowning of Zenocrate and the promise of a wedding in which armor will be cast off. More important even than the resurgence of the Turk, the death of Zeno- crate is the crucial event of part 2. The loss of one who "temper'd euery soule with liuely heate" (pt.2,2.3.2977) generates in Tamburlaine a mood of im- potent rage and releases "the fiery Element' in his nature (3026) to an unparalleled extent; he thus becomes fatally "distemper'd" with the same kind of fiery "fit" that destroyed her (2.3.3046; 5.1.4329,5.3.4470-2)."7 But the final unbinding of almost all his martial fire (it is still checked to some extent by other relationships) has another effect as well: it makes him pursue with single-minded ferocity the task of burning out all "earthly dregs" (3.3.3194-200). The death of Zenocrate, therefore, is not only the chief cause of his own end; it is also a means whereby he accomplishes the greatest of his achievements - the defeat of the Turk and all his allies - and the symbolic completion of his apocalyptic destiny-the sack of "the whore of Babylon" and the burning of the heathen books.18 The nature of Tamburlaine's bond with his followers provides clear evi- dence that in his play love stands for the binding force in nature and is not viewed simply in its sexual and aesthetic aspects. Tamburlaine claims that he values the meanest of his followers more than all the wealth of India, and although the common soldier is not given a voice in the action, this claim must be accepted. It is substantiated primarily by the nature of his relation- ship with the representative Usumcasane, Techelles, and Theridamas. These three acknowledge that his pre-eminence among men is as natural as that of fire among the elements (pt.2,5.3.4644); yet he addresses them only in such terms as "louing friends" (1.6.2 720), and whether he is absent or present they describe themselves simply and proudly as "the friends of Tamburlaine"</page><page sequence="8">66 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY (3.3.3383; pt.1,1.2.409). Moreover they are genuinely involved in his most im- portant military decisions; indeed he himself acknowledges his dependence on them, stresses that his glories are theirs too, and is quick to reward them with crowns as promised.19 Throughout both parts of the play this ideal re- lationship is pointedly contrasted with the self-interested and either fractious or falsely harmonious relationships which prevail among the opposing forces. Marlowe alerts us to the importance and significance of Tamburlaine's bond with his followers in the second and arguably most illuminating scene in part 1. After the opening spectacle of a discordant and decaying nation, where social and natural hierarchies are completely at variance, we are shown the emergence of a new society in a stable, dynamic, and natural order. It is here that the Scythian shepherd consecrates himself to the captive princess who will soon yearn to 'unite . . . to his life and soule" (3.3.1008), and it is here that Theridamas, an enemy turned friend, joins Usumcasane, Techelles, and Tamburlaine to form a quartet of unshakeable martial amity. Four, the number of the elements, was traditionally regarded as the number of natural unity and of opposites reconciled; in Pythagorean numerology it was the constitutive number and symbolized friendship (also justice).20 Its symbolic meanings are deployed in this scene when Tamburlaine solemnly binds himself to his three followers, swearing that his heart will be combined with theirs until their bodies "turne to Elements' (2.427-43). We must infer from this promise and its fulfilment (as from so much else in the play) that Tamburlaine's famous reference to "Nature that fram'd us of foure Elements,/Warring within our breasts for regiment" (2.6.869-70) should not be taken from its context and presented as an epitome of his world view. He and his friends are well aware that when 'Nature... gaue eternall Chaos forme" (pt.2,3.4.3486-7) she based that form on the dynamic interaction of striving and reciprocity. Tamburlaine's character is further defined by his relationships with his sons and the gods. It is of course in these relationships that he seems to expose himself completely to the charge of unbridled will and passion. Mar- lowe certainly provokes his audience to make this charge here, but he also makes it a very difficult one to sustain in relation to the imaginative context and the given frame of reference. The captive kings may thunder our real-life verdict that the killing of Calyphas is "barbarous damned tyranny" (pt.2,4.1.3813), but they are not objective voices and Calyphas is a despicable character. Moreover Tamburlaine defends his action in a thoroughly consis- tent and articulate manner. Marlowe too has laid the groundwork for this defense in the scene at the beginning of part 2 where Tamburlaine, accompa- nied by Zenocrate and their three sons, makes his first appearance on stage (the analogies and contrasts with pt.1,1.2 are important). In his opening speech here Tamburlaine expresses the fear that his sons' "looks are</page><page sequence="9">TAMBURLAINE THE GREAT AND THE SPANISH TRAGEDY 67 amorous,/Not martiall," and that an imbalance of the elements in their bodies may have given them a temperament lacking in martial fire (2590- 601). The truth, of course, is that Amyras and Celebinus do have "their con- quering fathers hart" (2605) (showing in the battle against the Turk that their love of him and of war function in unison): it is Calyphas alone who weakens the bonds of unity. His ridiculous display of cowardice and sensuality during the battle makes him a perfect emblem of that shamefully complete surrender to the powers of Venus which constitutes the other meaning of the Mars/Venus myth -what Tamburlaine himself had in mind when he brooded on "thoughts effeminate and faint" in the soliloquy prompted by Zenocrate's tears in part 1 (5.2.1958). Moreover Calyphas' gleeful anticipa- tion of a wrestling match with the captive whores (pt.2,4.1.3 746-7) not only convicts him of gross sensuality, it makes him spiritually identifiable with the Turk (even his name has a Turkish ring; compare "Calymath'). Tambur- laine's argument then that the death of this "fainting' and "effeminate brat" is "wars iustice," demanded both by Nature (fire must consume "the massy dregges of earth,/The scum and tartar of the Elements") and by God (who expects his Scourge to destroy what He abhors), is thoroughly convincing in its context (3795-841). Tamburlaine's determination to fit himself to the role which he believes to be divinely ordained for him is one of the most remarkable aspects of his char- acter. Many of his more boastful claims, however, have a degree of irrever- ence which seem to suggest that he "opposeth him against the Gods" (pt.1,2.6.850). This contradiction is symptomatic of the almost wilful delight which Marlowe takes in elaborating Tamburlaine's extremes, but it is hardly irresolvable. The note of audacious vaunting in so many of Tamburlaine's allusions to the gods is abundantly counterbalanced by his many utterances in the solemn religious vein and may be taken as the irreverence of a divine minion. Of course there are some defiant outbursts in part 2 which introduce a definitely discordant note into his relations with the divine- at the death of Zenocrate, when Calyphas reveals his "abortive" nature, and at the first approach of his own death (I find it impossible to treat the rejection of Mohammet in favor of a transcendent god as spiritual rebellion). These out- bursts, however, are all dramatically "placed" as temporary overflowings of those very qualities of love and wrath which have equipped him for his di- vine mission. The second and third too are followed by clear declarations of his acceptance of the limits imposed on him by divine law (4.1.3.783; 5.3.4512-5). Taken in its entirety, then, Tamburlaine's relationship with the divine is another manifestation of concordant discord. And at the end, when he perceives that it is 'in vaine' to "striue and raile against those powers/That means t'invest me in a higher throane," and advises his grieving sons to "no- bly ... admit necessity" (4514-5,4594), it is a relationship which is purified of all discord (the Stoic death of the Senecan Hercules is an undoubted influ-</page><page sequence="10">68 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY ence here). This ending is consistent with the dramatic portrait of a hero whose unorthodox career has been audaciously justified throughout in terms of orthodox ideas on the nature of nature and the providential ordering of the historical process. 3. Tamburlaine the Great, we may say, marks the beginning of Renaissance tra- gedy for two reasons: because its hero's "woful change" (4574) or untimely death is causally related to the strife of opposites (within and without); and because his noble end spiritually renews the marriage of contraries on which his greatness was built. Its tragic content nonetheless is superficially devel- oped. Tamburlaine changes fatally in that the fiery element in his nature takes almost complete possession of his emotional and physical constitution, yet this change brings with it no terrible mistake, no pitiable self-betrayal. His bond with the woman whose gentleness and beauty tempered his martial violence is broken only in a physical sense, and his friends are constant to the end: he does not experience the agony of betrayal (real or imagined) Athere where I have garner'd up my heart."21 He is born to set right a degenerate world, but not one which has changed so insidiously that the forms of love and peace remain while violent egoism mines unseen. Although he can baffle and polarize observers (on- and off-stage) by his astonishing combination of antithetical extremes in character, he himself remains unconfused: he knows who he is, who his enemies are, and what he must do. To the end, he belongs to a world which is more heroic than tragic. The Spanish Tragedy is very much nearer to the norms of Renaissance trage- dy: it is indeed the almost complete prototype. But it is important here to note that the differences between the two plays can be defined in terms of what they have in common. Although the Mars/Venus myth is not a continuous factor in the symbolic structure of The Spanish Tragedy, it commands a conspic- uously central position; moreover the idea of opposites (especially love and hate, peace and war) and the symbolic motif of the bond (embodied mainly in ritual and entertainment) are all-pervasive.22 But there is nothing stable in Kyd's world. The entire dramatic focus is on the undoing of bonds: on bonds which are wilfully shattered, or perversely entered into for destructive ends, or painstakingly established in circumstances which show them to be doomed from the start. And there is nothing clear either (except to the im- mortal spectator Revenge). The endless clash of opposites caused by the breaking of bonds means that confusion-in all the accepted Elizabethan senses of the word-prevails: destruction, loss of distinction and identity, bewilderment, and extreme distraction of mind.23 The two expository speeches describing Andrea's underworld experiences and the battle in which he was treacherously slain provide a complete (if un-</page><page sequence="11">TAMBURLAINE THE GREAT AND THE SPANISH TRAGEDY 69 The Spanish Tragemrl OR, i Hieronimo is mad agauie.

The battle is fought "Where Spain and Portugal do jointly knit/Their frontiers, leaning on each other's bound." From ordnance and musket comes liquid fire resembling "ocean's rage" when it 'gapes to swallow neighbor-bounding lands," so that a grassy field is soon turned to a purple plain where the limbs, heads, and trunks of men lie "mingled with weapons and unbowell'd steeds." Partly because Horatio proves at a crucial moment to be the exemplar of 'friendship and hardy valor join'd in one," the Spaniards emerge victorious from the "turmoil" of this hellish chaos. But they do not pursue their success to the extent of swallowing up the opposition; rather, they make a "peace conditional" promising to stay the "fury" of their forces so long as Portugal (whose "breach of faith" began the conflict- 1.3.33) keeps its "solemn vow" to resume payment of the neglected tribute. All this echoes, by analogy and contrast, Andrea's experiences in the underworld. There he becomes the subject of a dispute as to whether he should be placed among lovers or "mar- tialists'; it is resolved when the "mildest" of the three judges proposes as a 'device to end the difference" between the other two that he should be sent to the king and queen of the underworld for appropriate classification. In his journey to the "Elysian green" where Pluto and Proserpine reside, he has to follow a "middle path" among three, having on his left one which leads down to deepest hell where sinners are "overwhelmed" by Abloody furies," and on his right another which leads to "fields where lovers live, and bloody martialists,/But either sort contain'd within his bounds." His reward for following this Elysian path is a judgment "lseal'd with a kiss" between the royal pair. By his symbolic shaping of character, action, and setting here, Kyd com- mits the imagination to a contrarious universe. He intimates that the bond of opposites is the only alternative to furious strife and utter confusion, and at the same time shows what the bond signifies in practice. We are to under- stand that it is synonymous with moderation (mediating between extremes) and fidelity; that it requires ending one kind of difference but respecting an- other, and so entails justice in the full sense; and finally that in its hig3hest form it is a union of justice and love. These ideas are articulated at every level of form in the rest of the play. The action proper begins with the king's judicial "device" (1.2.191) to end "differ- ence" and "strife" between Horatio and Lorenzo concerning their capture of Balthazar, and to do it in such a way as to promote "love" between the dispu- tants and between them and the captive prince (167,178,194). This device is at once model and starting point for the king's plan to knit the two countries to- gether in 'a sure and inexplicable band" (3.12.45) by means of friendship and marriage as well as treaty. The plan of the moderate conqueror, however, is paralleled almost from the start by a countermovement aimed only at the extremes of violence and hatred ("extreme" is a ubiquitous word). This paral-</page><page sequence="13">TAMBURLAINE THE GREAT AND THE SPANISH TRAGEDY 71 lelism involves a contrast between public and private bonds which in terms of Elizabethan moral orthodoxy should posit a contrast between good and evil, secret bonds being usually regarded as inherently destructive (the work of conspirators and witches). Here, however, the antitheses of good and evil and of public and secret do not coincide, for the plan to establish a lasting peace between the two nations is founded on the assumption that the king's niece has no rights in choosing or refusing a husband. Indeed the king's urbane determination that Bel-imperia will marry the princely but ignoble Balthazar, and the "fury" (3.10.72) of her otherwise amiable father when she welcomes a noble but unprincely suitor, create an environment in which the secretive plotting and violent bond-breaking of her Machiavellian brother, and her own passionate schemes for love and revenge, acquire a certain inevitability. Ultimately, therefore, the royal device to end the difference be- tween Spain and Portugal combines with the after-effects of the Portuguese breach of faith to turn a festive court into a battlefield where differences are multiplied and confounded. In both construction and characterization confounding contrariety is the informing principle. Scenes are "split" and juxtaposed in such a way as to magnify the impression of mutually exclusive desires and plans all moving towards furious collision: the constant presence on stage of the ghost of An- drea and the figure of Revenge (always opposed emotionally and volitionally as well as cognitively to most of the other characters) is the most palpable sign of this technique. In characterization, a useful clue to Kyd's method lies in the proliferation of certain cognate antithetical terms which never appear in conjunction but lead a deceptively separate existence: such words as "gentle" and "wild," "'ruthful" and "ruthless," "patience" and "fury." The ethico-psychological dualism defined by these antitheses is shared by all the main characters (except Horatio) and lies at the heart of "the Spanish tra- gedy"; but it is only in the character of Spain's Knight Marshal that its poten- tial as a formula for tragic characterization is made clear. Loving father, famed man of law, and gracious courtly poet, Hieronimo reacts to the strange mutations of his world with the full horror of a sensitive moral spirit: "no world, but mass of public wrongs,/Confus'd and fill'd with murder and mis- deeds" (3.2.3-4). Yet he himself becomes an instance and an instigator of what appalls him. With the death of his son, and the perversion of his reason by "baleful humors" and "restless passions" (3.7.11,3.11.18), he is changed into a creature of extreme cunning and violence, becoming (with his Machiavellian antagonist) the instrument for Revenge's promise to Andrea that all love and joy at the Spanish court will quickly be turned to hatred and misery (1.5.1-9). The nature of the tragic world which Hieronimo comes to represent is in- geniously disclosed in the theatrical symbolism which is such an outstanding feature of the play's method. This symbolism points to a continuous con-</page><page sequence="14">72 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY fusion of appearance and reality: many of the characters are bent on deceiv- ing others, all are in the end deceived. The deceptive appearance, however, is almost always that of play, signifying (like the rituals of banquet and mar- riage with which it is linked) a joyous desire to foster human relations, while the reality belied is a grimly earnest desire to divide and destroy. Thus a major function of the play symbolism is to figure a root confusion of good and evil conceived in terms of love and hatred or concord and strife. Kyd's theatrical symbolism is evident at the level of diction in continuous playing on words which invoke the ancient analogy between life and the stage-"perform," "act," "tragedy," "plot," "jest" (entertainmentlmerriment), "spectacle," "show," and above all "device." Of course these puns are symptomatic of a sinister playfulness and irony which affect language gen- erally in the tragedy, making duality the norm. Similarly the paradoxical character of many of the theatrical puns (referring to real fictions, earnest play, and the like) is allied in function to the Petrarchan oxymorons and para- doxes which surface in the amorous effusions of the doomed Balthazar. In fact the paradoxical pun is the mode of expression to which Kyd's tragedy of confounding contraries naturally aspires. However the perfected form of this figure is one in which play and violence are confused, and it catches our atten- tion almost from the start: in his notably "cheerful" account of the fierce battle, the Spanish general reports that the two armies confronted each other "with daring shows" and "sundry colours of device" while "ordnance play'd on either side" (1.2.4,26-7,38). What is so striking however, about the theatrical symbolism is its bold and original incorporation within the action itself. The symbolic structure is dominated by actions of a dramatic nature placed at or near the end of each act. Although only two of them are necessary to the plot, all four of these "devices" are connected by means of analogy and antithesis (the second and last by a cause-and-effect relationship as well). They are the symbolic pillars of the play and together furnish a complete guide to its meanings. In strong contrast to the last two devices, the first two exhibit and celebrate the concord of opposites. Hieronimo's dumb show at the banquet for the Por- tuguese ambassador is designed by him to offer discreet advice to victor and vanquished on the conduct appropriate to each in the search for unity. It is thus in perfect harmony with the spirit of the banquet ("Spain is Portugal,/ And Portugal is Spain, we both are friends" - 1.4.132-3), and is greeted with equal enthusiasm by the king and the ambassador when its "mystery" (139) is explained to them. The second device, the love duet between Horatio and Bel-imperia (2.2,2.4), is not a dramatic action in the strict sense. It is, however, an exceptionally stylized scene; in it, too, the lovers playfully adopt the roles of Mars and Venus and are watched at first by two intensely in- terested mortal spectators (as well as those from the underworld). This duet of Mars and Venus is the imaginative center of the tragedy as</page><page sequence="15">TAMBURLAINE THE GREAT AND THE SPANISH TRAGEDY 73 well as the basis for its major peripeteia. Perfectly positioned towards the end of act two (in a four-act play), it has been well prepared for and is handled in a manner designed to maximize its effectiveness as a symbol of unity. The lovers meet here to consummate a "vow d mutual amity' (2.2.43) whose true beginning is on the battlefield where Horatio was "friendship and hardy valor join'd in one" (his fidelity to Andrea has helped him win Bel-imperia's favor). Consciously too they have chosen time and place to fit their conception of the rendezvous as a moment of "rare harmony" (3.8.21), meeting in Hieroni- mo's bower when Venus begins to rise and the nightingale to "frame sweet music' (2.2.45,2.4.28-33). Casting themselves as Mars and Venus, they act out, in their formal conjunction of hands, feet, arms and lips, and in their play- ful conceits, a lingering metamorphosis of martial confrontation into the kind of amorous strife that "breaks no bond of peace" - "a warring peace, or peace- ful war" (2.2.33,38). For the climax of this manifest dramatization of discordia concors, Kyd finds a remarkably appropriate verbal medium, and proceeds to use the climax as the springboard for a reversal which is devastatingly effective both as symbol and as theater. Twenty-four lines of rhymed, sticho- mythic dialogue culminating in, "0 stay awhile and I will die with thee,/So shalt thou yield and yet have conquer'd me," come to an abrupt end with the intervention of the murderers and the curt injunction of Lorenzo: "My lord, away with her, take her aside" (2.4.24-51). The next device is the dumb show in which the Hymeneal torches are sud- denly quenched with blood. An obvious prefigurement of the final device, it is symbolic not only of violent contrariety but also of incomprehension and non-communication. The show has been presented by Revenge in order to clarify the significance of the developing action for the baffled Andrea; but Andrea understands the explanatory dumb show no better than he has understood the spoken one, and not until Revenge awakes to "reveal this mystery" does he rest contented -"Sufficeth me, thy meaning's understood" (3.15.29,36). This echoes the moment when Hieronimo revealed "the mystery" of his show to the king, and the echo confirms the fact that the "dumbness" of both shows is part of Kyd's symbolic design. Throughout the second and especially the third act, Kyd has worked into his thematic structure the humanist idea of language as the primary instrument for social unity and civilized patterns of behavior, making the abuse, obstruc- tion, and final abandonment of speech a major symptom of violent con- fusion. The chief agent in the degenerative process which overtakes speech is the Machiavellian Lorenzo. As a politic courtier, he will play the orator, equivo- cate, and lie in order to cloak his malice (3.10.77-104,3.14.84). But he is also a great believer in keeping secrets and talking to no one but himself on important matters (3.2.79,3.4.47-9,64). And he holds it as axiomatic that "where words prevail not, violence prevails" (2.1.108). This axiom he puts into</page><page sequence="16">74 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY practice, and so sets the tragedy in motion, when it becomes clear that Baltha- zar has been pleading unsuccessfully for Bel-imperia's heart. To the prince's long-winded complaint that he cannot match the conceited persuasions of Horatio, he replies instantly: 'Her favour must be won by his remove" (2.1.8- 16,124-8,136). This is the true Lorenzo style, seen at its most horrific and sym- bolic when he sweeps into the arbor, terminates the lyrical duet, and issues the command which ends the scene: "Come, stop her mouth, away with her" (2.4.63). With this command, silence descends on the bower, and what con- fronts Hieronimo when he enters to find his son hanging from a tree is a "murd'rous spectacle" or dumb show with no eloquent "author" (2.5.8,39) to respond to his frantic questions and his even more frantic adjuration: "Speak, here I am . . 0, speak" (4,17). In the third act Lorenzo's violation of the bond of speech follows from his attempt to frustrate the course of justice by 'sequestering' Bel-imperia and then, when she has communicated her secret (in writing) to the Knight Mar- shal, by obstructing all his efforts to communicate it to the king. These delays combine with the shock of his son's death to send Hieronimo down the path followed by the despairing lover Balthazar. In soliloquy and monologue, he begins to identify himself with Orpheus - for the Renaissance, the god of elo- quence and law as well as of music and poetry-but with an Orpheus whose "unfruitful words" cannot move heaven, hell, or earth to grant him justice (3.7.1-73,3.13.68-123).24 He despairs of ever getting "justice by entreats' (3.8.72), is easily "struck mute" when his pleadings to the king are hindered, and finally resolves to dissemble, be secretive, and then "strike and strike home" (3.13.7,24). The lawyer-poet is about to become his own opposite. Despite the flaws which mar the conclusion (some so crude that they can only be put down to textual corruption), the last device stands out as a sym- bolic catastrophe of remarkable inclusiveness, the complete and culminating expression of the given tragic world. Its character as a symbol of violent confusion - murderous entertainment, funeral marriage, act of "mortal hate" caused by love (4.4.98) -is perfectly clear. But it is visually reinforced by the fact that it is a marriage play performed by four "friends" whose interaction mirrors the war of the elements.25 Its symbolic significance, too, is ingenious- ly elaborated by means of the play-life analogy. Kyd follows the logic of this analogy as far as it will go, devising for Hieronimo a dramatic entertainment that comes as near to complete confusion as the intelligibility of his own play will allow. Conceiving of his revenge as the destruction of Babylon, Hiero- nimo (unlike Tamburlaine) is conscious of the fact that "Babylon' ("Babel") means "confusion' (4.1.195-6).26 He is conscious too that the fall of proud Babylon brought with it the curse of tongues: his treacherous play is written in four languages, one for each actor. And although in the printed version of The Spanish Tragedy the playlet was "'set down in English . . . for the easier understanding" of "the public reader," it must surely have been acted in</page><page sequence="17">TAMBURLAINE THE GREAT AND THE SPANISH TRAGEDY 75 its polyglot form. When Balthazar protests that the performance "will be a mere confusion,/And hardly shall we all be understood," Hieronimo prom- ises that he will "make the matter known" in "an oration,/And with a won- drous strange show besides'; at this point Lorenzo advises Balthazar to humor the old man, so the matter is dropped (4.1.180-93). We must presume that Hieronimo has his way.27 That the proud bond-breakers should both die uncomprehendingly in Babylonical confusion, with one of them playing the part of a lover pleading "vain suits" to the "relentless ... ears" of a mistress who kills him in earnest, is poetic justice indeed (4.4.59-60). But once more it seems that Hieronimo has become identifiable with what he opposes. Despite his 'oration" to the audience, and his wondrous strange show (Horatio's body, with all its "poor, dumb mouths"), he fails to "make the matter known" fully. Having revealed that Lorenzo and Balthazar were killed in earnest in the play for their murder of Horatio, he contemptuously denies that he was mad and then bites out his tongue, leaving the king with no explanation as to why he, of all people, should have sought justice in so barbarous a fashion. Thus the king's, 'Speak... speak... I will make thee speak... Why speak's thou not?", echoes his own desperate appeal in the silent "garden plot" for an explanation of mystery (104,163-4,179). Orpheus has helped to reduce life almost to the condition of an inexplicable dumb show.28 The symbolic complexity of the final device is greatly enhanced by its as- sociation with decorum, the doctrine which demanded harmonious relation- ships and respect for differences in both life and literature (dramatic and non- dramatic). References to decorum (grace, fitness, pleasingness) occur throughout the play with almost ritual regularity, their combined effect being to strengthen the play-life analogy and to suggest that the unclassical disso- nances of The Spanish Tragedy itself are controlled expressions of tragic con- fusion. But the most explicit reference to propriety occurs in Hieronimo's discussion with his fellow-actors of the forthcoming wedding play. Balthazar remarks that a comedy would be more appropriate to the occasion than a tragedy, but Hieronimo appeals beyond the circumstances of time to that of person to justify the fitness of his choice (comedy for common wits, tragedy for royalty). His argument is secretly ironic (these people will get just what suits them), but it is also openly bantering; and the banter is typical of the jesting enthusiasm with which Hieronimo conducts his tragic plot and handles his intended victims. This jesting spirit is yet another symptom of the extent to which he has travelled down the left-hand path from his true self into the realm of extremity and confusion. We are to remember the cour- tier whose "pompous jest" (i.e., "stately show") (1.4.13 7) was perfectly attuned to persons and time, and above all the grave judge who was horrified by the way in which Pedringano, gulled by Lorenzo's "quaint jest" (4.5.5;cf3.6.13-7), clowned his way into the hangman's noose: "I have not seen a wretch so</page><page sequence="18">76 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY imprudent!/O monstrous times, where murder's set so light" (3.6.13-7). In his lethal jocularity and "delight in interdicted things" (3.6.92), Hieronimo is in- distinguishable from the hated enemy who played at murder and murdered play. Yet the final perspective on the Knight Marshal's device is affirmative. Expressing satisfaction now for the first time with what he has been shown ("spectacles to please my soul"), Andrea prepares to lead Hieronimo to a world where friends and foes are clearly distinguished and appropriately re- warded, and to place him there "where Orpheus plays' (4.5.12-48). Since there is no memorable restoration of Hieronimo's lost self in his last moments, no suggestion that others have learned or benefited from his desperate act, this affirmative note is noticeably abrupt and unsuccessful. Conceptually, however, it is closely related to the rest of the play. Like Mar- lowe, Kyd has concluded that the affirmative element at the end of the trage- dy of confounding contrariety should be based on clarification and concord: "differences" are to be confirmed and also ended. 4. It seems clear then that a view of the tragic which is much in evidence throughout the English Renaissance is shared by Tamburlaine the Great and The Spanish Tragedy: in this view, tragedy entails the sudden breaking of a bond or bonds, the bond being a union of opposites which limits strife, sustains love and justice, and forms the basis of identity and meaning. It seems clear too that all the more obvious formal means by which this view of the tragic is expressed and explored in the period originate in these two plays (mainly The Spanish Tragedy). We have seen one protagonist who oscillates be- tween polar extremes in emotion and behavior, and another who degenerates into his own spiritual antithesis; a villain who is the ultimate embodiment and chief source of duality, hatred, and injustice; the use of bold structural contrasts in such a way as to emphasize the splintering of reality into mutual- ly opposed forces and the imminence of sudden, unforeseen change; the depiction of the tragic environment as one of utter confusion in which language, rite, and play lose their binding efficacy, becoming instruments of duality and division; a treacherous entertainment which spectacularly epi- tomizes this environment; and funeral endings which suggest a remarriage of opposites, the re-constitution of a noble unity in the self, in personal relation- ships, in the relationship between man and fate (the gods, divine providence). Finally, it is evident that the contrarious mode of interpreting tragic experi- ence was consciously founded on a model of man and nature inrcorporate in Elizabethan cosmology. This is a point which surely deserves emphasis. Although we have all been made aware by now of the contrarious cast of Re- naissance and especially Shakespearean drama, we owe this awareness more</page><page sequence="19">TAMBURLAINE THE GREAT AND THE SPANISH TRAGEDY 77 to the influence of Hegel and Nietzsche (inheritors of the ancient metaphysics of polarity), and to the effects of the "new criticism,' than to any special in- terest in the intellectual background of the dramatists.29 Critics who have investigated the dichotomous aspects of Renaissance drama have usually been intent on counteracting the impression, given by much historicist criti- cism, that the playwrights of this period obediently endorsed all the more simplistic teachings of the time on the nature of man, society, and the uni- verse; with a few exceptions, therefore, such critics have been non- if not anti- historical in their methodological stance.30 Thus we have sometimes been given to understand that the intellectual conventions of the age were of little use to the dramatists in shaping their more original perceptions, and that only recently have we been furnished with thought-forms and word-con- cepts which approximate to their intuitively 'ambivalent' 'dialectic,' or "complementary" vision. It would be a pity if this view were to harden into critical orthodoxy, for it underestimates the degree of intellectual rapport which must have existed between the dramatists and their audience (even those of their audience who were unsympathetic to their more disturbing conclusions), and it overlooks the intellectual and imaginative spaciousness of pre-modern cosmology. It still bears recalling that the notion of reality as a dynamic system of interacting opposites - one of the most fertile in the whole history of ideas - lay ready to hand in the Renaissance as an in- strument perfectly designed to undermine monocular vision and to encour- age the acceptance of contradiction and uncertainty. As we have seen here, the concepts of discordia concors (or concordia discors), and the whole habit of thought which goes with it, enabled the tragic dramatist to move to and fro across a spectrum between essential optimism, implying the inevitability of re-integration and the growth of unity out of strife, and an essential pes- simism, implying the inevitability of violence and the utter fragility of those bonds which bar confusion in the objective and subjective worlds. A full historical account of the subject would consider the fact that the more adventurous thinkers of the Renaissance (Ficino, Pico Mirandola, Giordano Bruno, Cornelius Agrippa) were especially attracted by the con- cept of universal contrariety and knowledgeable about its origins and varia- tions in Pythagoras, Heraclitus, and Empedocles.3" But it should not be for- gotten that the concept was inherent in accepted teachings on the macro- cosm and the microcosm. Moreover its liberating potential was fully per- ceived and richly communicated in the Middle Ages by Chaucer in The Knight's Tale. Of course Marlowe and especially Kyd deserve enormous credit for showing how the metaphysics of polarity could nourish tragic drama; but much of what they suggested to others was discernible in Chaucer's tragi- comical romance. Chaucer's dialectic of love and hate, war and peace, male and female, Mars and Venus, "ernest" and upleye", violence and law, irregular- ity and ritual, funeral and marriage, chance and fate; his puns, paradoxes,</page><page sequence="20">78 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY elemental imagery, and quadripartite construction: all this is the substance of a deeply satisfying and endlessly elusive poem which has been interpreted not only as an affirmation of Boethian providentialism but also as an absurd- ist vision of a world in which men are the deluded instruments of powers who care little for them.32 In applauding (rightly) the formal and intuitive or- iginalities of the Renaissance dramatist, and emphasizing the affinities be- tween his way of thinking and ours, we might also applaud the paradoxical wisdom of Chaucer: 'Ther is no newe gyse that it nas old" (2125). - The University of Hull NOTES 1.

Sometimes both patterns are discernible in the one character -as in Faustus, Hamlet, and Antony. 3. Shakespeare spells out his contrarious conception of villainy in the passage on Sinon in The Rape of Lucrece (1555-61): "Such devils steal effects from lightless hell;/For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold,/And in the cold hot burning fire doth dwell;/ These contraries such unity do hold/Only to flatter fools and make them bold;/So Priam's trust false Sinon's tears doth flatter/That he finds means to burn Troy with his water." (The text of Shake- speare's works used in this essay is that of The Tudor Shakespeare, ed. Peter Alexander (London and Glasgow, 1951). Outside Shakespeare's plays, the subtlest embodiment of villainous contrariety is Middleton's Livia. 4. Examples are perhaps too numerous to require citation: the most memorable (after Kyd) are those in Titus Andronicus, Hamlet, Macbeth, The White Devil, Women Beware Women, and Tis Pity She's a Whore. 5. Both paradoxes are conspicuous in Antony and Cleopatra and Ford's The Broken Heart, ed. Donald K Anderson, Jr. (Lincoln, Nebraska, 1968) 4.4,5.3; they are also implicit in Romeo and Juliet and Othello.

The second occurs in Heywood's A Woman Killed with Kindness, Beaumont and Fletcher's The Maid's Tragedy, and Ford's Perkin Warbeck. 6.

Yet modern students of this tragedy do not seem to have noticed Middleton's subtle and continuous playing in the diction and im- agery on the opposites of "peace" ("quiet," "rest," "comfort") and "war" ("commotion," "storms," "rage," "affliction," etc.). 10.

For the Pythagoreans, four was constitutive in the sense that it was 'the root and father of all things,' a creative principle of order inherent in nature itself: thus in addition to the four elements there are the four qualities, humors, ages of man, seasons, points of the compass, and so on. For a subtle use of the number four in relation to the theme of unity and division, see my article "The Numbering of Men and Days: Symbolic Design in The Tragedy of Julius Caesar," forthcoming in SP (1983/4). 21. Although there is an implied contrast here with the heroes of Othello and Antony and Cleopatra, these plays were deeply indebted, I believe, to Marlowe's portrait of Tamburlaine.

Kyd's preoccupation with opposites has been studied from differentangles byJonas A Barish, "The Spanish Tragedy, or the Pleasures and Perils of Rhetoric," in Elizabethan Theatre, Stratford-Upon-Avon Studies, 9, ed. John Russell Brown and Bernard Harris (London, 1966), 68-70, and Sacvan Bercovitch, 'Love and Strife in Kyd's Spanish Tragedy," SEL 9 (1969):215-29. My own approach is close to Bercovitch's, but differs from it in emphasiz- ing the importance in Kyd's design of the bond or harmony of opposites, and, especially, their confusion. More generally it differs in its assumption that most of Kyd's ideas on unity and contrariety had for centuries been available in standard teachings on the nature of the cosmos and the psycho-physical constitution of man. 23. For the use of the word in the last sense see Hamlet (3.1.2-4), where it is virtually synon- ymous with "lunacy" (4). 24. On the Renaissance Orpheus, see Kirsty Cochrane, "Orpheus Applied: Some Instances of his Importance in the Humanist View of Language," RES 19 (1968):1-13. 25. That Kyd divides his tragedy of aborted love and unity into four acts may well indicate symbolic intention too (compare the quadripartite construction of The Knight's Tale). There had been a few instances of four-act tragedies written in Latin during the Renais- sance, but this is the only one written in English. See Edwards, ed. Spanish Tragedy, 70. 26. S.F.

The reasons for the king's query and Hieronimo's refusal to answer are not clear and have provoked much discussion. My own explanation does not account for Hieronimo's reference to a vow of silence, but it does fit the immediate situation as well as what I take to be a controlling pattern in the play. 29.

Notable exceptions are Bercovitch (n.19), Smith, and Grudin (n.29) Historical justifica- tion for dualist interpretations of Renaissance drama has also been supplied by Theodore Spencer, Shakespeare and the Nature of Man (New York, 1942), and Hiram C. Haydn, The Counter-Renaissance (New York, 1950), both of whom present the period as one of great intellectual conflict and uncertainty; and also by Rosalie F. Colie, Paradoxia Epidemica: 7The Renaissance Tradition of Paradox (Princeton, N.J., 1966), who relates the Renaissance enthusiasm for paradox to the intense intellectual activity of an age when different ideas and systems were in competition with one another and men had to learn to live with contradiction and uncertainty (32-3). 31.
