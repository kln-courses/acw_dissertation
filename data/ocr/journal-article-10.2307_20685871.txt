<plain_text><page sequence="1">Puppet Play and Trauerspiel Rainer N?gele Engel und Puppe: dann ist endlich Schauspiel Rilke Readers of Walter Benjamin's Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels tend to focus their attention mainly on the part of the book that deals with melancholy and allegory. A few more ambitious critics occasionally struggle with the immensely difficult epistemological preface. The first two sections, that contain not only one of the most powerful readings of baroque theater, but also a theory of modern theater and drama as well as a theory of the subject, are generally neglected. One of the reasons for this partial reading or not-reading of Benjamin's book is the odd constellation of its subject matter. Few readers of Benjamin are familiar with the texts from which he construes what he calls "origin," and few baroque specialists are serious readers of Benjamin. But another resistance might be at work in this screening of attention. Much of Benjamin criticism is shaped by the tradition of the Frankfurt School with its particular Hegelian reading of Marx and Freud. Despite strong counter-tendencies within the Frankfurt School itself, especially by Adorno, this particular combination of Hegel, Marx, and Freud coalesces in a concept of the subject that is firmly grounded in self-reflection and the Ego. Both Marx's class subject and Freud's psychoanalytic subject are thus displaced, in a subtle assimilation process, to the bourgeois subject ideal.</page><page sequence="2">Puppet play and Trauerspiel 25 Benjamin's theatricalization of the subject radically undermines any such assimilation attempts in a unique interweaving of theater, theory, allegory, and melancholy. For this reason, the book on the Trauerspiel, although written before Benjamin's study of Marxism, prepares the ground for his historical materialism that is radically different from the usual Freudo-Marxism of the Frankfurt School tradition.1 It is not by chance that Benjamin's most important epistemological text appears as a preface to a book on theater and theatricality: theater and theory are intimately linked not only through their common Greek root in theorein (to watch, see), but also in the two German terms vorstellen (put forward, present, imagine) and darstellen (present, represent, depict). Both verbs are compounds of stellen, one of the three words that translate the Latin poner?, usually translated in the triad setzen, stellen, legen (i.e. putting something in one of three positions: sitting, standing, lying). Vorstellen and darstellen are both theatrical and epistemological concepts, and they structure the world and our knowledge of it in terms of position, i.e. in terms of relation rather than substance.2 In German, theater can be called a Vorstellung in the sense of "performance" or "show." The Vorstellung begins and ends at a certain time. We may also talk of a Vorstellung of the theater in the sense of a notion or concept of the theater. The dominant Vorstellung of theater since the 18th century has been theater as drama: (re-)presentations of human subjects who affirm themselves in antagonistic dialogues and self-reflective monologues. The hero of the drama might perish, but will triumph in perishing. In the disappearance of the hero's body the voice of the autonomous subject emerges: a mouth that speaks?m?ndig is the German word for the mature, grown-up subject. But something remains that is not necessarily silence or dialogue, but pure theater and show, Vorstellung in which the body of the actor does not merely represent something, but shows and presents itself, the Self as body.</page><page sequence="3">26 Puppet play and Trauerspiel There are tensions, ruptures, even battles between drama and theater, but also complex interrelations. The conflictual relation between the two might be told as a historical tale, as a movement from the theatricality and carnevalesque corporeality of earlier plays toward an increasing interiorization and a dialogical replacement of gestural theater in bourgeois drama. With the rise of modernity, however, theater claims again its rights in the name of the body on the stage: Brecht's gestural and epic theater, the theater of cruelty and the absurd, a theater where a clown appears and stumbles ostentatiously over his body, his oversized feet. The body becomes visible as an obstacle, it speaks through irritation. This awkward corporeality of the clown admonishes the viewer not to misunderstand the rhetoric of the body as a naive return to a natural origin or object. Such historical lines will quickly run into difficulties, among them such sizable ones as Shakespeare for example. History forms constellations rather than lines. The opposition of theater and drama is such a constellation and we will present it in the form of a theoretical Vorstellung, beginning with baroque theatricality: Die br?st erstarrt, doch schwitzen alle glieder Der ganze leib erbebt. (The bosom is petrified, but all the limbs are sweating, the whole body trembles.)3 Der Stirnen kalter schwei?, das zittern aller glieder Nam pl?tzlich ?berhand. Die tr?ben augenlieder Erstarren nach und nach. (The cold sweat of the forehead, the trembling of all limbs suddenly took over. The blurred eyelids gradually petrify.)4</page><page sequence="4">Puppet play and Trauerspiel 27 The trembling of life intersects with the p?trification of death in a body shaken by pain. This body does not express soulful interiority, but only bodily fluids: sweat. Such scenes are common in the German Trauerspiel of the seventeenth century. The presentation of the tortured, physically dismembered body is part of the repertoire. Gryphius does not spare the imagination any detail. It begins with the presentation and exhibition of the naked body: Man ri? die kleider hin, die unbefleckten glieder Sind ?ffentlich entbl??t. (11. 61-62) (One tore off her clothes, the immaculate limbs are publicly exposed.) Then body and limb are fastened in a kind of premortal p?trification and rigour: Man hie? die zarten h?nd und f?? in fessel schlie?en Und zwang arm, leib und knie mit ketten an den pf?hl. (11. 66-67) (The order was given to lock the tender hands and feet in fetters. Arms, torso, and knees were forced to the stake with chains.) Before the dismemberment begins, the voyeuristic glance draws the contours of the whole body, inserts it in a flowing frame of hair, and prepares it as a kind of wax puppet for the dissection: Sie stund gleich einem bild von Jungfernwachs bereitet; Das haar fiel um den hals nachl??ig ausgebreitet Und flog theils in die lufft, theils hing als in der wag,</page><page sequence="5">28 Puppet play and Trauerspiel Indem man auf der br?st sp?rt jeden aderschlag. (11. 69-72) (She stood there like an image made of virgin wax; her hair fell casually around her neck, part of it flying in the air, part floating in a balance, while one could notice each beat of the pulse on her breast.) This pure flesh and wax image becomes the scene of exquisite operation: Der hencker setzt in sie mit gl?hend-rothen Zangen Und griff die schultern an: der dampf stieg in die h?h. Der stahl zischt in dem blut: das fleisch verwschwand als schnee In den die flamme f?llt. Doch sie, indem man zwickte Und von der arme r?hr die flachen mausen r?ckte, Rieff... (11. 73-79) (The henchman applied the red-hot tongs... and attacked the shoulders; the steam rose high. The steel hissed in the blood; the flesh melted like snow in which a flame has fallen. But she, while they tore off the flat muscles from the bones of her arms, cried out...) After a short interruption by her prayer, the description the torture continues in inexorable detail: Die st?cker hiengen nun von beyden Schenkeln ab, Als man ihr auf die br?st zwey grimme Z?ge gab.</page><page sequence="6">Puppet play and Trauerspiel 29 Das blut spr?tzt um und um und leschte brand und eisen: Die lunge ward entdeckt. Der geist fieng an zu reisen Durch die vom scharffen grimm neu aufgemachte thor. Mich stie? entsetzen an. (11. 91-92) (The pieces were dangling down from both thighs, when two grim jerks were exerted on her breast. The blood spurted all around and extinguished fire and iron; the lungs were uncovered. The spirit began its departure through the new gates opened up with sharp brutality. I was overcome with horror.) At this point, the body of the representative watcher and narrator of the torture is seized by the trembling, p?trification, and sweat quoted above. What is conjured up for the imagination through this narrative report can also be shown on stage. The torture of Agerinus in Lohensteinfs Agrippina seems to take place on the open stage, accompanied by Nero's increasingly grim orders for the dismemberment. The body of the actor is a problem in such scenes: insofar as the actor represents the scene through his living body, he cannot present it without actually suffering the torture. Presentation and representation, Darstellung and Vorstellung intersect in the actor as a paradigm for the strange oscillation of the body between physical entity and imaginary subject/object. Some critics have thought that puppets might have been substituted for real bodies in such scenes. Benjamin quotes one such conjecture in order to radicalize its possibility: "The corporeal appearance of the actors themselves, especially that of the king in full array, could appear rigid like a puppet" (LI, 304).5 Does the puppet represent the body, or does the body represent the puppet? If the representation can move in both directions, the simple opposition of autonomous interiority and marionette-like unfreedom collapses.</page><page sequence="7">30 Puppet play and Trauerspiel In twentieth century theater the tortured body and the puppet reappear on the scene. In the clown scene of Brecht's Badener Lehrst?ck vom Einverst?ndnis, a gigantic puppet is dismembered limb by limb. Heiner M?ller takes it up as a "night piece" in his Germania Tod in Berlin: A man stands on the stage. He is larger than life-sized, perhaps a puppet. He is dressed in posters. His face has no mouth. He masters his hands, moves his arms, tries out his legs. A bicycle from which handlebar or pedal, or both, or handlebar, pedals, and saddle have been removed, moves quickly from right to left across the stage. The man, who is perhaps a puppet, runs after the bike. A threshold rises up from the stage floor. He stumbles over it and falls. Lying on his belly, he sees the bike disappear. The threshold disappears unseen by him. When he gets up and looks for the cause of his fall, the stage floor is smooth. He suspects his legs. He attempts to tear them off in sitting, lying on his back, standing. The heel on the behind, seizing his foot with both hands, he tears off his left leg, then, falling on his face, lying on his belly, the right leg. He is still lying on his belly, when the bicycle slowly moves past him from left to right. He notices it too late and cannot reach it in crawling. Rising up, supporting his swaying trunk with his hands, he discovers that he can use his arms for locomotion, swinging his trunk, pushing forward, following with his hands etc. He practices the new method of walking. He waits for the bicycle, first at the right, then at the left gate. The bike doesn't come. The man, who is perhaps a puppet, tears off both of his arms at the same time, the right one with the left hand and the left with the right hand. Behind him a threshold rises up from the stage floor to</page><page sequence="8">Puppet play and Trauerspiel 31 the level of his head, this time so that he does not fall. From the gridiron comes a bicycle and remains standing in front of him. Leaning against the head-high threshold, the man, who is perhaps a puppet, watches his legs and arms that are lying around widely dispersed on the stage, and the bike that he can no longer use. He weeps a tear with each eye. Two Beckett spines are moved in from left and right, at the level of his eyes. They stop near the face of the man, who is perhaps a puppet; he only needs to turn his head, once to the right, once to the left, the rest is done by the spines. The spines are moved out, an eye on each point. Out of the empty eye cavities of the man, who is perhaps a puppet, lice are crawling forth and spread black over his face. The mouth originates with the scream.6 The dismemberment takes place in the three positions of sitting, lying, and standing. Two events occur to the body of this man, who is perhaps a puppet: he loses his limbs and he receives a mouth. Receiving a mouth, becoming m?ndig, suggests in German, Enlightenment. Kant defines Enlightenment as the emergence of man from self-inflicted Unm?ndigkeit, i.e. from a state where he is not capable of using his own mouth and reason to speak for himself. But if Heiner M?ller's scene shows how a man gets a mouth and thus becomes m?ndig, it also shows the cost. It is literally a thorny process that destroys the eyes. Is this a denunciation of Enlightenment or a dialectic of Enlightenment? The Enlightenment speaks in the name of light. The rising sun is its emblem, the eye its privileged organ: seeing and surveying are its most valorized activity. M?ller stages it as a Nachtst?ck, a night piece. Blinding and night are not unthinkable for the Enlightenment, to make them thinkable is the highest desire of Enlightenment. The blinding of Oedipus is declared by Schelling the constitution of a free subject, assuming responsibility for all of its deeds. To the degree</page><page sequence="9">32 Puppet play and Trauerspiel that the Freudian subject has a space of freedom, it is constituted through the reenactment of the oedipal drama. J.M.R. Lenz staged it as a literal castration in his Hofmeister (The Private Instructor, 1774). Generally the event is presented in less drastic terms and images, but its echo can be heard in metaphors and similes: "Here the external, physical sun rises and goes down in the West: but in its place the inner sun of self-consciousness rises with a higher light."7 There is no indication of a higher light and an inner sun of self-consciousness in M?llems scene. While the man who is perhaps a puppet is given a mouth, it is not used for speech; it is used for screaming, and the man, perhaps, remains a puppet. At this point, the similarity between the Baroque and Modernity seems to have reached its limits. In Gryphius's play, the tortured body is the body of a martyr with the vision of another light. When Catharinau servant, horrified by the dismembered body of her mistress, questions the light of the sun ("O does the sun still shine"), Catharina answers in triumph: "We have overcome. / We have found through death life itself1 (11.121f). These are Catharinau last words before death. Benjamin's immersion in the abysmal sadness of these texts penetrates their rhetorical proclamations by insisting on the theatrical show. He points out the insistence with which corporeal tortures are ostentatiously presented. The Baroque martyr plays "aim less at the actions of the hero than at his or her suffering, and even less at the spiritual tortures than the corporeal suffering" (1.1, 252). Benjamin sees in the baroque Trauerspiel a radical secularisation of the medieval mystery plays that empties all transcendence and leads toward a cancellation of all transcendence (1.1,258/9). The manifest Christian religiosity and rhetoric of Gryphius seem to contradict this interpretation, and yet they confirm the strength of Benjamin's reading. Catharina's triumphant last words are neither her last words nor the last words of the play. Her death has not yet satisfied the play's obsession with shows and</page><page sequence="10">Puppet play and Trauerspiel 33 demonstrations of the tortured and destroyed body. The priest returns to the stage with the burnt head of the queen. He exhibits it and shows the "grim cracks" through which the spirit fled the "anxiety-house" of the body. The spirit that escaped through these open cracks will appear at the end of the play. In this apparition, supposedly the confirmation of the transcendence of the tortured body, the transcendence is undermined. Catharina appears twice at the end of the play, first as an apparition to the imagination of the enamored torturer Chach Abas, and later she enters the stage as a warning ghost. In Chach Abas' imagination, she first takes the form of a torn body ("O horror! O! What appears before my vision! Is that you, once the pleasure of his heart? How terribly the torn breast is dangling down!"?11. 375-77). Then his imagination surrounds the body with "more beautiful flesh" than ever. When Catharina finally appears on the stage, the stage directions do not say in what form she is to be seen. But her words are less those of a transfigured saint than of a revengeful ghost.8 The last words conjure up decay and destruction. To be sure, the very last word of the play is lieben (to love), but it is spoken not by Catharina, but by the tyrant, Chach Abas, who, at the end, appears as the martyr of the unhappy love for the beautiful dismembered body. Gryphius' Catharina von Georgien is a paradigm for the Trauerspiel as a staging of an unfathomable melancholy and an equally unfathomable pleasure in the imagination and (re-)presentation of torture.9 The painful pleasure of a desire whose object is lost speaks in it. Its secret and true hero is Chach Abas, the tyrant as martyr of desire. Theatrically and ostentatiously the lost object, or rather its loss, is staged in mourning. Benjamin calls the melancholic world an empty world that is revived in the form of a mask. There is also a sadistic sense: the desperate pleasure in the ever renewed and revived presentation of the loss. It might also be considered a very Christian pleasure in the theater. Catharina's spirit announcing with pleasure the horrors and tortures that await Chach Abas is the spirit of the</page><page sequence="11">34 Puppet play and Trauerspiel Christianity that Nietzsche quotes maliciously in the words of Tertullian: The highest bliss of the saved Christian will be a theatrical bliss: the heavenly joy in watching the tortures of the damned.10 But the spirit of modern theater also begins to speak in the Baroque. Between Baroque and Modernity, however, another history seems to intervene. It would be the history of bourgeois drama as a history and story of the autonomous, self-reflective subject born from the spirit of the Renaissance. In his introduction to the Theory of Modern Drama, Peter Szondi has concisely sketched the self-perception of this history as a foil against which the modern drama in its difference can be articulated.11 In Szondi's historical and typological perspective, the classical drama from the Renaissance to the nineteenth century is undermined by an epic tendency of the modern drama. The move from the dramatic to the epic is at the same time a move toward the theater and the theatrical. Szondi's localization of the classical drama in the Renaissance ties it together with a specific notion of subject formation that has its major framework in Hegel. The classical drama, according to Szondi, "was the spiritual adventure of man, having come to consciousness [zu sich gekommen] after the collapse of the medieval world, to reconstruct, solely through the representation of the intersubjective relations, the fictive reality [Werkwirklichkeit] in which he wanted to assert and mirror himself" (p. 16). Two phenomena interact in this description: the collapse of a world formation and the reconstruction of a new one. This new formation is less a world formation (Weltbild) than a subject formation (Menschenbild) in the form of a reflected mirror image. The new subject appears self-reflectively as "the adventure of man having come to himself" (zu sich kommen can mean to come to one's senses, to regain consciousness after a state of unconsciousness). Who comes to whom, when one comes to oneself? Where was this man before he came to himself and where was he to whom he has come?</page><page sequence="12">Puppet play and Trauerspiel 35 The idiom zu sich kommen indicates a process that is not controlled by the conscious subject, but an event like waking up, when one suddenly finds oneself in this or that situation, position, and condition. The idiomatic reflexive expressions "to find oneself," sich finden, sich befinden (to be in a given state, mood, or condition), se trouver, have gained specific significance for self-expression since the late Middle Ages. Dante's mi ritrovai opens up the great epic at the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance.12 He who finds himself thus finds himself split into subject and object. The paradigmatic image of this experience and rhetoric of self-finding in the self-splitting is the mirror.13 The fictive reality of the classical drama is therefore in Szondi's words a mirror in which man can "assert and mirror himself." But in asserting himself, in putting himself in a firm position (fest-steilen), man first asserts and positions another in whom and through whom he finds his hold and position. Not only mirrors of glass, every other person, as other, becomes a kind of mirror. Marx presents the process in a witty representation of Hegel's dialectic of self-consciousness : In some sense, man is in a similar position as the commodity. Since he is not born with a mirror nor as Fichtean philosopher (saying: I am I), man mirrors himself first in another man. Only through his relation to the man Paul as someone like him, the man Peter has a relation to himself as man. In doing so, the man Paul with skin and hair, in all his Paulinian corporeality, is for the man Peter a phenomenal type of the genus Man.14 The position of this Marxian digest of Hegel's dialectic of self-consciousness as a footnote to the analysis of the commodity form, puts self-consciousness into rather dubious light. As a human corporeality with skin and hair,</page><page sequence="13">36 Puppet play and Trauerspiel the mirror will cause some further consequential displacements in the identification process of the subject. The specular image of self-consciousness abstracts from the corporeality with skin and hair for the sake of the whole form as Gestalt. Insofar as the classical drama is the scenic presentation of this specular subject of self consciousness, its corporeality is transfigured through the transformation of gestural theater into pure dialogue, that takes place between the bodies. Szondi describes the process as a dialectic of interiority and exteriority: "Man entered the drama so to speak only as fellow-man. The sphere of the 'in-between' seemed to him the essential part of his being" (p. 16). A typological comparison between Brecht's epic theater as well as the theatrical qualities of the baroque Trauerspiel with Szondi's sketch of the classical drama can outline the contours of this dramatic world more clearly and through it the difference between two concepts of the subject. At first glance it seems that the space of the "in between" as the essential dramatic space is valid for Brecht's epic theater as well. It is true to the degree that the social sphere of human interaction is more important for Brecht than individual characters. The difference, however, is marked by the structure of this "in-between." The sphere of the "in-between" that Szondi attributes to the classical drama is at the same time a space of metaphorisation where m?tonymie contiguity is transformed into metaphoric substitution, extensive side-by-side into intensive interiority. Szondi presents this event in the form of its inversion, in the literalisation of a metaphor: "The 'place,' where he [man] came to dramatic realisation was the act of coming to a decision (Akt des Sich-Entschlie?ens). By opening up to and deciding for the world of fellow men (Indem er sich zur Mitwelt entschlo?), his interiority became manifest and dramatic presence" (p. 16). The literalisation of Entschlie?en (to decide) as disclosure, opening up, brings out the metaphorisation of the scenic space as the manifestation of an interiority. In contrast, both the baroque Trauerspiel and modern drama confront the audience with</page><page sequence="14">Puppet play and Trauerspiel 37 the unmetaphorical interior, literally with the guts and "innards" of the opened body. Hofmannsthal's play Der Turm, an adaptation of Calderoni La vida es sue?o, brutally stages this non-metaphorical interior in Sigismunde tortured memory of the opened body of a butchered pig.15 The act of metaphorisation is a safeguard against these brutal manifestations of the body. Safeguards are also exclusions: the stronger the threat, the more violent the exclusion. The shrill rhetoric with which metaphor is often defended agaist literalisation is a symptom: "I did not mean it literally, and you'd better believe me...." Szondi's formulation of the dramatic act of Entschlie?en is also characterized by rigorous exclusion: Everything on this side or beyond this act [of decision/disclosure] had to remain foreign to the drama: the inexpressible as well as expression, the closed soul as well as the ideal already estranged from the subject. And above all the inexpressive, the world of things if it did not relate to the intersubjective sphere. (p.16) The emphasis with which "the inexpressive, the world of things," is banned and excluded points toward the realm of things as the strongest threat to the dialectic of self consciousness. In the baroque Trauerspiel, in Calderon's theater, in the romantic tragedies of fate, things assert their uncanny power. Benjamin gives them special attention that arises out of an affinity of experience. The strange intertwining of things and words in the Berliner Chronik and the Kindheitserinnerungen cannot be reduced to a critique of reification in the bourgeois world. The world of things is too ambiguous for such a reduction both because of the intensity with which they are experienced and the rigorousness with which they are pursued. Even in its social dimension, reification is not a purely negative phenomenon for Benjamin. He sees, for example, the reification of the</page><page sequence="15">38 Puppet play and Trauerspiel actor into a pure requisite of the film industry as a welcome critique of the bourgeois subject notions. In its intention, Brecht's epic theater is diametrically opposed to a notion of tragic fatality: human conditions are not governed by some dark fate, but by social conditions that are man-made and can be changed by men. It is striking, however, how much care and attention Brecht as a director gave to objects and requisites on the stage. The movement and position of things are as important as the figures in the scenic ensemble. The selection of an old hat for a short episode is more important than all psychological character studies. Although things in Brecht's theater are not invested with magic fatality, they are sedimentations of social experience. Benjamin's observation concerning the baroque plays, that fate is equally distributed over figures and things, is analogically true for Brecht's social theater. The constellation of figures and things is replaced by the dialogue in classical drama. Szondi distinguishes dialogue from prologue, chorus, epilogue, and monologue as "intersubjective exchange," as "representaion of the intersubjective relation." It is the highest dramatic achievement to develop everything through the dialogue with as little recourse as possible to introductory expositions, commentaries, and interpretations through 'external' means such as prologue, chorus, or epilogue. This dramatic principle is the genre-specific dramatic variation on the general aesthetic rule of complete immanence of meaning, expressed in the classic-romantic concept of the symbol. It is therefore not by chance that Benjamin's theory of Modernism and its specific subjectivity also implies a revalorization of allegory and a critique of the classic romantic concept of symbol. Two modes of representation are involved here. What Szondi sketches as the type of classical drama is also the type of bourgeois representation that is valid not only in aesthetics but for all forms of life. Its core is immanence?a representation of an interiority in and through a homogeneous, adequate exteriority. The form it takes in drama is what Hegel called "intensive totality," a central and</page><page sequence="16">Puppet play and Trauerspiel 39 representative conflict in which the totality of all social relations of a given time find their expression. It presupposes the homogeneity of a metaphorical space where at any point the representative substitution is possible, because in every individual, in every self-consciousness that forms itself against another, the true drama is performed. The history of the genre, however, indicates the fragility of this mode of representation. While its theory dominates aesthetics and literary criticism throughout the nineteenth century, the classical drama shrinks to an ephemeral phenomenon if one tries to find concrete examples. In the realm of the theater it is always in competition with other forms. In literature, the novel rather than the drama became the most important bourgeois genre. In the novel, the fractured representation of the bourgeois rather than the sovereign representation of the citoyen asserts itself in compromise formations. Brecht's concept of the epic theater is intimately linked to this shift of genres. The contamination of the dramatic by the epic corresponds to a historical constellation of the subject to whom the classical ideal of representation is denied. H?lderlin had already recognized this in his letter to B?hlendorff where he praises the epic treatment of the drama as more adequate to the status of the modem subject.16 In contrast to the ideal of immanence in classical drama, the mode of representation in baroque Trauerspiel as well as in modern epic theater is ostentatious exteriority. The baroque theater has its model in the form of representation of the baroque ruler whose sovereignty is not linked to a personal interiority but is invested in the insignia. Significance and power are grounded in a transcendental outside: stamped by that signifying transcendence, any thing can be representative, but never from within itself. What remains or reappears in modern drama is the form of this representation: the rupture between signifier and signified, the decentering of subjective interiority, and the dissemination of the signifying power through the world of things and requisites. The seemingly contradictory modem tendency toward the lyrical drama of the Fin de Si?cle with</page><page sequence="17">40 Puppet play and Trauerspiel its ethereal spirituality is only the other side of the same phenomenon. The splitting of the theater into the polarized forms of rarefied spirituality and crude corporeality is the symptom of a constellation that was formulated already in Baudelaire's "spleen et id?al." In the most radical form of Brecht's epic theater, in the Lehrst?cke, theatrical ext?riorisation undermines a bourgeois concept of subjectivity in order to make tabula rasa for a radically different form of subjectivity. The erasure of the face is the emblematic signature of these pieces. Rilke's "angel and puppet"17 arises from an analogous oppositional structure. It points at a future spectacle and at the task of another subject born from the spirit, or rather the gesture of the theater. The "and" between angel and puppet separates and connects at the same time. It designates a double distance: the distance between the ideality of the angel and the dead materiality of the puppet?Rilke's spleen and id?al?but also the absolute distance that separates both from any kind of psychological interiority. Like the angel, the puppet allows for no emphatic ingratiation. It is a pure ob-ject whose resistance forms a different subject.18 The figure of the puppet began to occupy Rilke in 1914, after he saw Lotte Pritzel's wax puppets, derived from children's puppets or dolls. Rilke describes them as a kind of adult dolls: In them the puppet has finally outgrown (entwachsen) the understanding, the empathy, the pleasure and worries of the child, it has become independent, it has grown up, precocious, it has entered the unreality of its own life. (11,1063) The doll is already a paradoxical double as anthropomorphous dead thing. While its anthropomorphous figure invites dialogue and dialectic self-experience in the</page><page sequence="18">Puppet play and Trauerspiel 41 apparent likeness of another, the dead shell of the stuffed body blocks and displaces identifications. The puppet thus becomes the scene of an early subject formation different from the formations and identifications before the mirror and with living persons. It is a scene that idealistic communication theories cannot acknowledge, although hardly a child misses it, even if a piece of wood has to replace fancy dolls. Rilke's essay on Pritzel's wax puppets stages this scene with a peculiar intensity. He begins theatrically, with the anthropomorphization: the puppets have "outgrown the understanding, the pleasure and worries of the child." Entwachsen means two things. The puppets can no longer be grasped through the transference and empathy that they have outgrown and escaped, but entwachsen also means that they have grown out of it as of their ground. They are a determinate negation of transference and empathy, their negative embodiment. It accounts for "their horrible dense forgetfulness." It is the horrible density of something the subject does not want to remember, "the hatred that, unconsciously, certainly was always part of our relations to it [the puppet]" (11, 1066). Rilke's puppet is a shell filled with waste and refuse (Werg). It is filled not with the tenderness that the child might have invested in the doll, but with what has fallen off from the other, unadmitted side of the ever ambivalent relation. While the child can deal with things, even identify with them (to be a table, to be a sofa, to be a locomotive is no problem), it cannot identify with the doll, precisely because of its anthropomorphous appearance. Because it is a "human" thing it is a "non-thing," an Unding, a monster that encounters us "as the ghastly foreign body for which we have wasted our purest warmth" (11, 1067). The "foreign body" remains pure surface, dead human body: "a superficially painted watercorpse that is lifted and borne by the inundations of our tenderness, until it got dry and we forgot it in some shrub" (11, 1067). In an enigmatic constellation of the imaginary, Trakl's poetry remembers and invokes them in shrubs and bushes.</page><page sequence="19">42 Puppet play and Trauerspiel The wax puppet that has outgrown the infantile narcissism transforms the organic growth (Wachsen) into the inorganic artifact of wax (Wachs). Rilke does not name the wax, he spells it when he writes that they have "entwac/tfen". The spelled letters are the wax of writing, its materiality to be stamped and sealed. The Wachs does not live. Yet it literally points at the living Wachsen, inscribing life into a language bearing the marks of an affective imprint: I know, I know we had to have such things that would put up with everything. The simplest intercourse of love was beyond our notions, we were incapable of living or acting with a person who was something; at best we could press ourselves into such a person and get lost in her. (11, 1067) "I know, I know": The formula has a familiar ring. It is uttered in countless disputes as a defense disguised as a concession. One admits something theoretically in order not to deal with it affectively: I know, I know?but don't look atme. Writing is mute, but it spells clearly what the affect would like to erase. "We had to have such things." We had to have them, because the edifying stories of innocent love between mother and child and all the other stories of beautiful love ties in the intimate circle of the bourgeois family are not true. The puppets dissolve the familiar love stories. Brutal childish narcissism cannot live or deal with living persons. No dialogical development of the self from person to person is possible. What is possible between living persons is physical confrontation and annihilation through total incorporation: "at best we could press ourselves into such a person and get lost in her." Rilke does not mince words when it comes to mincing family relations. The little boy would like to press himself physically (hineindr?cken) into his mother, but the child would then be lost.</page><page sequence="20">Puppet play and Trauerspiel 43 To avoid death and taboo, we need the puppet. A different subject from that of the dramatic scene is formed in view of the puppet. While the drama is constituted by dialogue, the puppet, the anthropomorphic Unding, radically refuses dialogue: At a time when everybody was still eager to answer us quickly and soothingly, it, the puppet, was the first one who confronted us with that larger than life silence that tinged us later from the great space when we stepped somewhere at the limit of our existence. (11,1069) In contrast to the dramatic dialogue, where the intersubjective exchange of glances and words folds the world-space into the subject-space in such a way that only human space is left, the puppet delimits the subject against an Other space. Instead of the continuity of a space that would be completely human, completely metaphorized interiority, the contiguity of an empty space expands before the puppet, continuing through the interiority of the subject, exteriorizing it as a hollow space in space: "In front of it, when it stared at us, we first experienced (or am I wrong?) that hollowness in our feeling, that pause of the heart" (11, 1069). The staring puppet is as terrifying as the angel. What saves us from this terror? Rilke indicates two possible answers. One seems to happen on its own, without our help. We would dissolve in the terrifying pause of the heart "if at that moment nature in all its continuous soft way would not lift us over abysses like a dead thing" (11, 1069). Unconscious mimicry of death offers a rescue very different from the tragic hero's triumphant acceptance of death for the sake of an ultimate self-assertion. The other potential rescue lies in allegory. The puppet leads to a point of extreme alienation and defamiliarisation:</page><page sequence="21">44 Puppet play and Trauerspiel But we soon realised that we could neither turn it [the puppet] into a thing nor into a human being, and in such moments it became something unknown, and all those intimate things with which we had filled and inundated it became unknown to us in it. At this point the mode abruptly changes and the text continues in the form of direct address: The fact that we did not make you into an idol at that moment, you shell (du Balg), and that we did not perish in fear of you, was due to the fact, I want to say, that we didn't mean you at all. We meant something completely different.... (11, 1070) Dialogue is refused by mimicking a dialogue. Addressing an emphatically underlined you, the "you" is denied. The text says "you," but it means something different: it means it with the emphatic willfulness ("I want to say") that is called allegory. Rilke calls this other intended meaning a "puppet soul." Yet it has little in common with the soulful world of the drama and the classic-romantic symbol. It is neither the soulful body of dramatic actors who mean each other with body and soul when they address each other, nor is it the animated, soulful world of things that Rilke's text addresses in the next paragraph with great rhetorical pathos: Great courageous soul of the rocking horse...or you, convinced soul of the streetcar...simple pleasant soul of the ball, soul in the smell of dominos... soul of the picture book. Soul of the satchel...deaf funnel soul of the little trumpet... (11,1070/71). All these souls of things are leutselig (affable). The pun of these affable souls (leutselige Seelen) expresses the full</page><page sequence="22">Puppet play and Trauerspiel 45 irony toward the soulful and meaningful world of the classic-romantic ideal that finds its true and only fulfillment in this naive childish world of things. In adulthood it is continued in the phantasmagoria of the world of commodities. The puppet soul is far removed from this soulful world, untraceable, beyond reach, and yet derived from what seems to be the most touchable, the human body. The horror of the puppet that calls for allegory, compelling us to mean something different from what we say, is the horror of the body, so near and so foreign, nearest and most foreign in its sexuality. Children's dolls used to be sexless, and Rilke's text zeroes in on this fact: "Sexless like the children's dolls themselves, they [the wax puppets] find no downfall of the insistent, imminent rapture" (11, 1073). The vocabulary? anstehende Wollust (insistent or imminent rapture, lust, jouissance)?asserts the sexuality denied to the doll. It is not a neutral sexlessness, but a determinate (de-)negation that emphatically points at the missing sex. It is not only the grammatical gender of puppet (die Puppe) that sexualizes it as a female figure in Rilke's text. The sexless puppet is specifically the puppet without a phallus. Because it has no phallus it seems "bottomless without phantasy" (11, 1067). It becomes the scene for something that "occurred unrecognizably" to the adolescent. The first fluffy growth of hair that accompanies the awakening of sexuality is metaphorically displaced in Rilke's text to that organ that for ages has chastely substituted for sexual desire: "For hours, for whole weeks we could be content to fold the first fluffy silk of our heart before this quietly submissive mannequin." In contrast to the ideal of the Bildungsroman, growing up occurs here not as an unfolding development, but as a folding and refolding. What is happening? Two possible events are indicated, each invested with its own terror. One is the inexorable call of sexuality itself through the figure of the now unequivocally female puppet: "when that unoccupied creature continued to spread out heavily and dully, like a</page><page sequence="23">46 Puppet play and Trauerspiel peasant Danae knowing nothing else but the gold rain of our inventions: I wish I could remember whether we then rebelled." The terror of this scene for the little boy comes not only from the demanding sexuality of the other sex, but also from the phantasmatic consequence that puts the little boy in girls' clothes into the sexual position of father Zeus. Only the possibility of a distraction that takes the glance away from this Unding to real things saves the boy from the terrifying scene. As if by chance, the distracted eye finds "the head of an indestructible Punch figure (der Kopf eines Kaspers, der nicht umzubringen war). Kasper's head becomes a counter-image of the puppet. It seems to move closer to the position of the marionette, which, in this text, is categorically distinguished from the puppet: "because the marionette has nothing but phantasy, the puppet has none." How are we to understand this curious differentiation? Are marionettes different because they have a playful, theatrical identity ascribed to them which the puppet as doll does not have? Although dolls can take up all kinds of roles and positions when children play with them, they are always unstable, invested only by the play of the moment. What might be more important is the indeterminateness of their sex. It is their claim to sexlessness that differentiates dolls from marionettes. Even dressed-up female dolls project a pr?tention of sexlessness. The marionette, on the other hand, participates as a theatrical figure in the play of sexual difference marked by the phallus. To have phantasy, as Rilke says of the marionette, means, in this context, to have the phallus; but in the sexual economy having the phallus is also not having it, to have it through castration. We might call it the factor pha, as abbreviation and condensation of phantasy and phallus in the marionette's phantallus. Kasper's head begins to spell out a few things. It first spells the hidden Ka in the pha, the Kastration in the phantallus. Through this Ka, Kasper's head swings back into the proximity of the puppet or doll, which appears in Rilke's text in an explicit analogy with the Egyptian Ka: "Nourished with make-believe nourishment like the Ka" (11,</page><page sequence="24">Puppet play and Trauerspiel 47 1064). The Egyptian Ka signifies a kind of soul, but also procreative power. Its hieroglyph, a pair of theatrically raised arms, could well be the gesture of a puppet or marionette. Rilke's analogy between the puppet and the Ka is based on the make-believe nourishment of the puppet that removes it from the real. The puppet is inscribed in a symbolic order that does not exclude robust materiality: "impenetrable and incapable in its extreme condition of anticipated density to take in even a drop of water in any spot." The puppet seems to reach from one extreme to the other: from absolute impenetrability to the absolute receptivity of the "peasant Danae," from material sexlessness to phantasmatic sexualisation. In this economy of affirmation and negation, of taking in and not taking in (the phenomenon at the source of Freud's concept of negation), the head of the Kasper, the Kasperlkopf with its alliterating Ka, is a condensed center where the Egyptian Ka melts together with the Ka of Kindheit (childhood) and Kastration. It is in the middle between children's doll without phantallus and the marionette with phantallus. The fact that it is the head of a Kasper figure that detracts from the threatening puppet indicates damage and mutilation. One should not forget, however, that Kasper figures are hand puppets and are therefore, even when they are "whole," only a head with two hollow arms and clothes. Yet they act out their sex roles savagely and obsessively. Kasper is especially violent and cunning in his ever renewed battles against threatening witches and castrating policemen. Lou Andreas Salom? seems to have touched upon something in this dimension. Unfortunately, her letter with its commentary on the puppet-essay has been lost. Rilke's response to the letter indicates that she had uncovered a text under the pretext: "But is it not terrible that one wrote down something like this unsuspectingly under the pretext of a memory of puppets...?"19 What Rilke understands from Salom?'s letter is a phrase about "the unification of the puppet with the corporeal and its most horrible fates." The puppet is the embodiment of these fates, and it merges with</page><page sequence="25">48 Puppet play and Trauerspiel the person who wrote, "unsuspectingly," these puppet memories: "talking of one's most intimate self, and then, quickly putting away the pen, one acts out once more infinitely, as never before these ghastly things: until each morning one's mouth grew dry from the stuffing (Werg) with which one was stuffed up to the mouth, stuffed shell through and through." The essay leads to a theatrical staging, an unlimited, excessive acting-out of a scene in which the subject enters the puppet phase. The theatricality of the scene is related to the act of writing: it emerges from an (unsuspecting) writing and interrupts it. What enters the scene is a man who is (not just perhaps) a puppet, "stuffed shell through and through" (Balg durch und durch). Heiner M?ller's scene with the man "who is perhaps a puppet" enacts a primal scene of theatricality and its function in the formation of the subject. The stuffing of the puppet-subject, the Werg, is pr? textile waste of flax and hemp; it is etymologically identical with Werk (work). Until the eighteenth century werk and werg were interchangeable. But after that time, an interiorized notion of work as an expression of the innermost self posits it in radical opposition to Werg and Balg. As mere stuffing, Werg remains pure exteriority even when it is "inside," because it is an unmetaphorized, untransfigured interior. It belongs to the same category as that which is mechanically memorized and can be learned through mechanical repetition. Late eighteenth century pedagogy seeks instead true interiorization and organic assimilation. Its "works" are now expressions of true interiority, produced by the creative genius, not by the creature that is subject to the fates of the body. It is a transfigured form, not stuffed shell. This secularized theology claims for the immanence of this world what for Luther was still an event after death: "wir m?ssen uns also mit dem alten balge schleppen und martern, bis wir an jenem tage gar geistlich fleisch werden" (we therefore must bear and torture ourselves with the old shell, until we will become on that day all spiritual flesh).20</page><page sequence="26">Puppet play and Trauerspiel 49 This Balg, the shell we must bear and suffer is presented both in the baroque Trauerspiel and in modern theater as unredeemed skin. From this perspective, the classical drama and its subject ideal appear as the dream of a self that dreams itself beyond the fates of its corporeality. Kafka presents this dream in The Castle in the episode when ?Ka again?encounters the secretary B?rgel (a name that is close to B?rger [bourgeois]). Dreaming of a battle with a Greek god, is betrayed by his own body, and sleeps through what might have been the most promising offer from die cast?e. It was Kafka, who modified Kant's categorical imperative: "Act in such a way that there will be work to do for the angels." From the puppet's position, the invocation of the angels seems to occur with an inner logic. Rilke stages the puppet scene once more in the fourth Duino elegy. The scene presents the transition from the children's doll to the theatrical puppet. It points toward a specific notion of theater that Rilke calls Schauspiel. The elegy does not yet present this Schauspiel, only a kind of foreplay in the theater. The scene opens with one of the basic motifs of the elegies: the difference of man and nature as difference between a consciousness that is always split and an unconscious, undivided security. "Wir sind nicht einig" ("We are not unified"). The "we are" can be represented only as a contrast with a theatrically staged allegorical nature. The text describes this mode of representation: Da wird f?r eines Augenblickes Zeichnung ein Grund von Gegenteil bereitet, m?hsam, da? wir s?hen: denn man ist sehr deutlich mit uns. Wir kennen den Kontur des F?hlens nicht: nur, was ihn formt von au?en. (11.14-18) (Then for the drawing of a moment a ground of contrast is prepared, strenuously, so that we would see; for one is very clear with us. We do</page><page sequence="27">50 Puppet play and Trauerspiel not know the contours of feeling: only that which forms them from the outside.) The ground invoked here is also the ground of theater opposed to "reality." The common negative connotations of "theatrical" are marked by a counter-projection of "genuine" and "true" actions and feelings. The mark of this split and opposition in the "real" theaters is the abyss of the orchestra pit that separates stage and audience. According to Benjamin, the removal of the orchestra pit is the primary act of Brecht's epic theater. Theater has its ground in a split, that is also the split of the self: "Wer sa? nicht bang vor seines Herzens Vorhang?" ("Who has not sat anxiously before his heart's curtain?"). It also performs a splitting: "Die Szenerie war Abschied" ("The scene was one of parting"). The theatricalization of the heart as the primary metaphor of interiority is less an interiorization of the theater than an externalization of bourgeois interiority in the allegorical theater. It is an act of inversion: instead of dissolving the split in an interiorized nature, theatricality radicalizes exteriority to the point where the living actors are replaced by the puppet. Even the perfect human actor always remains split; he is always also the bourgeois who occasionally walks "through his kitchen into the living room." The puppet is Rilke's radical rejection of the symbol in the name of the theater and allegory. In allegorical theater, in theatrical allegory, fullness takes on the brutal materiality of stuffed skin, shell, and puppet. No transfigured interiority expresses itself. There is only Aussehn (looking out, the way something or someone looks, appearance) that one must endure (aushalten). When the lights have gone out (another aus), only an "I" remains, but one whose position is determined by a split: "Ich bin davor" ("I am in front of it, before it"). This davor, a space of pure in-between-ness or partition, indicates the scene of the show, that is constituted by pure acts of looking and nothing else. Through this structure theater is intimately linked to allegory. In contrast to the</page><page sequence="28">Puppet play and Trauerspiel 51 classic-romantic symbol, allegory does not hide the split between signifier and signified. It stages it, immerses itself, as Benjamin writes, into "the abyss between pictorial being and meaning." "In this Abyss of allegory the dialectical movement" plays itself out (1.1, 342). It is the scene where Rilke's angel must enter "der die B?lge hochrei?t" (who violently pulls up the stuffed shells of the puppets)?where theater and theory, puppet and angel meet. 1 Adorno is closer to Benjamin in this respect; but the reception of his texts has assimilated him almost completely to the standard (non-) reading. 2 Heidegger's use of the terms Gestell and Vorstellung can only be mentioned here; its discussion would require a reading that goes beyond the scope of this essay. 3 Andreas Grypius, Leo Armenius, 11., 7-8, in: Gryphius, Trauerspiele.
