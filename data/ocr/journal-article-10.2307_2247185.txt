<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIII.-NEW BOOKS. [Thzese Notes (by varioas hands) do not exclude C-Jitical Notices later on.] Francis Bacon: An Account of hiis Life and Works. By EDWIN A. ABBOTT, D.D., Autlhor of Bacon and Essex and Editor of Bacon's Essays; formerly Fellow of St. John's College, Cambr idge. London: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1885. Pp. xxxix., 508. The author, who ha(l previously done goodl work upon Bacon, has ended 'by writing, this considerable volume wlheni he started with the design of o-mpressing all he had to say within the compass of a short "Literature Primer". It is an independent accouint of Bacon's life, character andl works, and lhas featuires that give it lno small interest and value. After an 'ar-umentative " Introduction" (pp. v. -xxix.), tulrning chiefly upon a dis- piited incidenit in the Chancellor's judicial career, it (ives, first, a stinmary of " Events in Bacon's Life and Tiimes " (pp. xxxi.-ix.) which, besidles being otherwise useful, helps to fill in those parts of the following narrative that are (as in the closing years) less acdequate than they might be. The " Life" fills 331 pp., and, if it does not give evidence of special familiarity with the p)olitical history of the period which it covers, vet presents a view of Bacon's action throughout that is alwavs well considered and often shows genuine insight. Especially notazble is the final statement of the "pro- 1)iei m" of Baconr's character, with the "solution" `that his moral derelictions ,(1) were justified in Iris own eyes " by the lhope that if he rose to eminence in the State he shouild llave a larger command of industry and ability to help himi in his philosophic work"; (2) did not appear such, because of hiis high estimiiate of his own character, sustailned not only by his "con- sciousness of vast plans of universal philanthropy, btut also by an habitual inaccuracy of miiinid comlbined with an uinusually sanguine disposition," ruaking himii " always take the most favourable views of evervthing that Concerned himnself". Here, especially with his second point, Dr. Abbott .surely transfixes the mark. Part ii., " Bacon's Works," without pretendlinig to go very far into scientific or philosophic mnatters, is comprehensive and instructive ; there is oinly, at p. 410, a somewhat uincalled-for outbuLrst x(gainst that deeper kind of philosophical inquiry which is not therefore to be miade light of becausa Bacon had no aptitude for it. After some Ap- pendices, more or less philosophic in character, the book ends with an Index that is most happily redolent of Bacon at his best-as the master of all who write. J1. Tulli (Ciceronis Acaclemica. The Text revised and explainied by JAMES S. REID, M.L., Fellow and Assistant Tutor of Gonville and Caius Colleg,e, Camribridge; University Lecturer in Roman Historv. Lon- don: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1885. Pp. x., 371. AMi. Reidl in putting forth this elaborate edition of Cicero's treatise expresses the opinion that " there is no ancient plhilosophical work which oughllt to be of (-greater initerest to miiodern students of philosophy, and particuilarly to English students, than the Academica ". The arguments of tlie; New Academy against dog,matism are, lie contends, essen- tiallv identical with the iiost imiiportant sceptical argiuments of modern tiumes; and the Stoic replv that the criterion of certitude is simply otur conviction of the truith of ouir imipressions is the only reply that it has</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS. 461 ever been found possible to make to the sceptical positioni. He protests: against the excessive depreciation of Cicero as a philosoplher by recent historians, explaining it by political partisanship. Cicero, he contends, was essentially not a politician but a man of letters. He was not an original pbilosopher; but be had profound philosophical learning ; and in his. time no one sought for originality in philosophy. The question 6f Cicero's. accuracy as a translator and interpreter of the Greeks does not seein to the present editor to be settled ; btut from his own sttudies he has forlmled a very favoturable opinion of it ; "'confirmations of Cicero's accuriacy," he says, " often comie to light in the most unexpected quarters ". He argues that the defects of bad arrangement, want of lucidity, &amp;c., with which Cicera has been charged, may verv well be due to his Greek originals ; probably, nothing but the framework of the dialogues, " the local scenery, the illus- trations fronm Roman history anid the connecting links" are of his owln invention. Mr. Reid's historical discussion of the philosophical schools of the aae of Cicero and his relations to each of them as well as to individual teachers is very full. Works of THOMAS HILL GREEN, late Fellow of Balliol College, and Whlyte's- Professor of Moral PhilosopLiy in the Uniiversity of Oxford. Edited by R. L. NETTLESHIP, Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. Vol. I. Philosophiccd Works. London: Longmans, Gireen &amp; Co., 1885. Pp). Xxvii., 541. This edition will include all Gireen's printed works except the Prole- gomena to Ethics (Oxford, 1883), and also a selection from his unpublished papers. The promise, in another volume, of suLch new matter is hardly more welcolme than the collection, in the pmesent one, of his two Intro- ductions to Hume, with his later Articles on contemporary English psychology, as represented by Lewes and Mr. Spencer. It is well to have the famous ' Introductions ' in accessible form, apart from Huime's works, and it woulld very usefully lighten an otherwise excellent edition of Humiie if in future it should be issued without the ' Introductions 'that made it so unwieldy. The later Articles, filling about a third of the present volumlle, are five in number, including the one (v.) in which Green replied to Mr. R. Hodgson's defence of Mr. Spencer, and one (iv.), on Lewes's doctrine of the Social Medium, that bas not been previously published, beinig withheld, at the time when it was written (1878), on account of Lewes's death. " In reprinting, a few obvious corrections have been made in the text, and the divisioni inito sections and marginal analysis, wbicli the autbor had iimade for the ' Ilntroductions' to Hume, have been continued throughl the rest of time volume," except in the case of Article v. The Logic qf Definition: Explained and Applied. By WILLIAM L. DAVIDSON, M.A., Minister of Bourtie. London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1885. pp. xxiv., 353. The author of this work has endeavoured (1) to formnulate and expoulnd the principles of Definition and (2) to apply them. The spheres of applica- tion are m-lainly-the Dictionary, the School-book, Philosophical Voca- bulary, Philosophical Questions, and Taxological Biology. He has kept constantly in view the wants of the student of philosophy and of the teacher, seeking, also to be helpful to Dictionary-compilers and writers of educational manuals. An Appendix (pp. 319-30) gives somiie account of' Boethius with an abstract of his De Divisione. Sonme discussions now in- corporated with the work have appeared in past numiibers of MIND.

By JOHN BEATTIE CROZIER. Londoln: Longnmans, Green &amp; Co., 1885. Pp. 453. The "New Oroanon" (Part i.) is the sttuldy of the mind as a concrete -whole, in the miianner of the "seers," such as Carlyle: this method the ;author aims at reconciling, with the scientific miethod of Conite and Mr. Spenicer. " The Goal " (Part ii.), " the end that Nature has at heart," is "'the expanision and elevation of the individual mind ". "Liberty and 2expansion are ends in themselves, order alnd duty are only means." The error of Comte's politics was that, instead of the elevation and expansion of the individual, he made the order and stability of society as a whole his chief concern. In Comte's view of religion (Part iii., " The Religion of Humanity ") there is " a confusion of planes ". " Religion, in its true and final form, will have no effect on Action, but will be restricted to givin,g that harmony and satisfaction to the Intellectual, Moral and Emotional sides of our nature, which is necessary to their balanced and healthy activity." (Part iv., "Religion".) Its object muiList in the end be "a, divine mind behind the world" ; it cannot cease to be in some sense anthropomorphic. The last two Parts of the book (v., " Government," vi., 'Theory of Progress ") are chiefly concerned with more special political theories. " The mnaterial and social conditionis of men" are, the author holds, "the controlling factor in civilisation and progress". " Mr. Spencer, by attaching the problem of Civilisation to a renmote, abstract and imper- sonal law of Nature, rather than to iminediate, humnian and concrete causes, has left the problem still unsolved." On the otlher hand, civilisation is not to be best advanced, as Comte held, "by primarily addressing the hearts and imiiaginations of men, by appeals to their conisciences and ex- hortations to duty and self-sacrifice"; but "by ameliorating the material andl social conditions of mnen, in the belief that, out of the improved condi- tions, thle hiigher morality will arise of itself ". The Social Philosophy and Religion of Comte. By EDWARD CAIRD, LL.D., Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Glasgow. Glasgow: Jami-es Maclehose &amp; Sons, 1885. Pp. xx., 249. The central principle of Comte's philosophy (" the vital spot," "the Achilles' heel ") is the idea of a " subjective synthesis ". This idea is an advance on the individualism of Locke and Hume with which Conmte started, and from which critics of hiis svstem such as Littre and Mill never escaped ; but because he was unconscious of the philosophic movement of which he formed part, of his real agreement with modern "'metaphy- sicians," who, equLally with himself, reject the abstract individualism of the last century, his synthesis remained imperfect. His imagination had, indeed, escaped from the presuppositionis of his understanding, and in the adoration of space and of the earth " optimism, which is rejected at the beginning as truth, is brought back in the end as poetry ". But this optimism can be theoretically justified; for, when we once depart from the purely individual point of view and, with Comte, regard man as the reality and the individual as a mere abstraction, we are compelled to seek a higher unity in which the opposition of Nature and Humanity also disappears. Comte's position resembles Kant's ; it is intermediate between the philo- sophy of the last century and that of Kant's idealistic successors. In- ferior to Kant in power of speculative analysis, Comte was able to give a kind of insight into the social needs of modern society such as we could not expect to gain from Kant. The defect of his synthesis is that it is not "4subjective " and not "relative" enough. A step further would have brought him to see the identity of a complete subjective synthesis with an</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS. 4-63 objective syntlhesis, an(l to the doctrine of a relativity in whicih humanity itself is seen as ain organic part of a larger whole. When this position is attained it is no longer necessary to deny the reality of the individual ; for, if the individual can only exist as a unit in the social organism, humanity on the other hand can only find its realisation in the individual. , Through not recognising this, Comte is unijust to Protestantism and to the revolu- tionary movement, regarding them as exclusively negative, while they hal really a positive value, in so far as they reaffirmed the direct relation of the individual to the unity of the whole. His historical treatment of Christianity is, again, defective, because he recognises only its mono- theistic and not its " pantheistic " element, viz., the doctrine of " recon- ciliation with God, aiid therefore with the world and self, which is alien to pure monotheisml' ". When the identity of a complete subjective with an objective synthesis has become clear, we see that science left to itself tends to unity, that there is no need to impose on it an artificial unity l intellect is not, as Comte says, essentially " dispersive," but might with equal plausibility be represented as ten(ding to a premature synthesis again, the absolute opposition, supposed by Comte, between intellect andi emotion, is a .remiinant of that " abstraction " against which lie himself, in common with idealistic metaphysicians, protests. In conclusion, Prof. Caird acknowledges, notwvithstancling all this criticism, the value of muclh of Comte's teachina, and especially of that which is contained in the Politique positive. " Controversy itself," he remarks, " is a kind of homage; for, as Hegel says. 'It is only a great imian that condemins us to the task of explaining himi'." Plato and the other Companitons of Sokr-ates. By GEORGE GROTE, Author of the History of Greece. A New Edition in Four Vols. London- John Murray, 1885. Pp. xxx., 457; xxiv., 428; xxii., 426 ; xix., 419. "In the present Edition, with a view to the distribution into four Volumes, there is a slight transposition of the author's arranigement. His concluding chapters (xxxviii., xxxix.), entitled ' Other Comiipanions of Sokrates,' and 'Xenophon,' are placed in the First Volume, as chapters iii. and iv. By this means each Volume is made up of nearly related subjects, so as to possess a certain amount of unity. Volume First contains the following subjects: -Speculative Philosophy in Greece before Sokrates; Growth of Dialectic; Other Companions of Sokrates ; Xenophon; Life of Plato; Platonic Canon; Platonic Compositions generally; Apology of Sokrates; Kriton; Euthyphron. Volume Second comprises *-Alkibiades I. and II.; Hippias Major-Hippias Minor; Hipparchus-Minos; Theages; Erastaw or Anterastae-Rivales; Ion; Laches; Charmides; Lysis; Euthy- deinus; Menon; Protagoras; Gorgias; Phmdon. Volume Thirdc:-Phaedrus -Svmposion; Parmenides; Themtetus; Sophistes; Politikus; Kratylus; Philebus; Menexenus; Kleitophon. Volume Fourth:-Republic; Timmeus and Kritias ; Leges and Epinoinis ; General Index. The Volunmes may be obtained separately." Myths and Dreams. By EDWARD CLODD, Author of The Childhood of the World, Jesus of Nazareth, &amp;c. London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1885. Pp. 251. Myths, of which examples are selected from all sources, are explained (Part i., pp. 1-139), chiefly from the anthropological point of view, as the product of the modes of thought of primitive iian (assumed to be analogous to those of modern savages and of the less cultivated classes of civilised nations). In Section 4 (" The Solar Theory of Myth ") the author accepts, in part, the theory of philologists as to the common</page><page sequence="5">464 NEW BOOKS. origin of somie groups of Aryaln imiytlhs, but contendls that, in trying to ex- plain all the details of aln epic poem, for examliple, as parts of a sun or dawn myth, they neglect an element that ought to be takell into accouiit, viz., the tendenev, wvlien once a myvtl has been formed, to invest its personages witlh aln indepencdent human interest and, consequently, to modify the incidents of the story. This element has taken the chief place in the Homeric poeills, while " in the Veda the primitive nature myth, although exalted anti purified, is persistent ". Strictly speaking, however, the Veda is not primitive, but is the product of a relatively high civilisation. Sections 2 and 3 of Part ii. (" Dreams," pp. 143-244) are devotecl to "Limitatiolns of Balbaric Language" andc "Barbaric Conftusion between Namiies and Things" the rest is concerned with the barbaric theory of the soul, the various beliefs derived froiii it, and the modifications it has un- dergone froiii the stage of "primitive animism" to modern timies. The moire special object of the book is to explain from the primitive interpreta- tion of dlreams the origin of beliefs in the supernatural. T'heosophy, Religion and Occult Science. By HENRY S. OLCOTT, President of the Theosophical Society. With Glossary of Eastern Words. London: G. Redway, 1885. Pp. xiii., 384. The joint-founder (with Madame Blavatsky) of the Tbeosophical Society, wlichl since its origin in 1875 has won so much public notoriety, here 1- :y-.t.-vher, with some "Forewords" and an introductory chapter l :; .. x or Materialismn-Which ?", eleven addresses which he has de- livered1 within the last five or six years, mLostly in India, on the natuire -and ainis of a movement th11at professes to be at once scientific, philo- sopllic and religious. Col. Olcott appears in these pages as an earnest nan of the apostolic sort, with no mean expository, or at least liortatory, gift. He is not unacquainted with the later phases of English philo- sophical thlought, andl he has satisfied himiiself that modern thinkers and scielntific men are babes, in respect of insight alid effective power over nature, as comlipared witlh the ancient Indian sages; whose wisdom has been transmitted by occult channels throtugh a succession of favoured or superior individuals till the present time, when the signs declare that it may become ,. ' of a larger portion of hiumanity (from India out- wards) and the regeneration of the race. The book is very well fitted by its frank disclosures to make plaiin to any readers whether they are of those to whom salvation is to conie bv this new-old way aimd who slhould think of treading it farther. Thoughts om Science, Thteology and Ethics. By JOHN WILSON, M.A., Trinitv College, Dublin. London: Triibner &amp; Co., 1885. Pp. 197. The result of the three clhapters on Science, its use and its methods (Part i) is that scientific anid theological modes of thiought are, " from the nature of things, incompatible ". In Part ii. (on Ethics, its object and scope, the origin, nature and sanction of the moral code) the author defines etlhics as " the science of social conduct ". The rules of social conduct are found to have arisen from " the necessity of social co-operation ". The really effec- tive sanctions of these rules, or of " the moral code," are the legal and the social sanction, togetlher with " the subjective sanction" * the stipernatural sanction has had little or no influence on mnorality when it has not had an evil influLence. If we take Religion in the theological sense of worship of " a man-like ghost," science can have niothing to do witlh religion; "but a-ccepting as a dlefinition of the word religion-the obligation or sense of duty whicih rests on the minds of men arising from the felt relation in which they stand to some superior Power, it becomes possible for science to liave a religion ".</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS. 465 The Common Sense of the Exact Sciences. By the late WILLIAM KINGDON CLIFFORD. With 100 Figures. (" International Scientific Series.") London: Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Co., 1885. Pp. xiii., 271. The editor of this volume, " K. P.," explains that it was originally (from about 1875) to have been entitled "The First Principles of the Mathe- matical Sciences explained to the Non-Mathematical," and got its present name frorm the author only shortly before his death in 1879. There were to be six chapters--on Numnber, Space, Quantity, Position, Motion, Mass. Of these, Clifford left only the first, second and fifth, with part of the third. The present editor, who took up the task of preparing the book for press when it fell fromii the hands of the late Prof. R. C. Rowe, has sought, in conformity, as far as possible, with the author's spirit, to complete the account of Quantity, to treat of Position (pp. 147-226), and, in lieu of the other non-extant chapter on Mass, to supplement the account of Motion, in c. 5, with two short sections on the Laws of Motion and on Mass and Force. His work in these extensive additions and otherwise throughout the volume has certainly been far froml light, and deserves all acknowledgnment. Clifford's own exposition is marked by all his well-known characteristics, but does not appear to contain anything novel, in point of principles, be- yond what it contained in his " Philosophy of the Pure Sciences " at the end of Vol. i. of his collected Lectures and Essays. Physical Expression, its Modes and Principles. By FRANCIS WARNER, M.D. Lond., F.R.C.P., Assistant Physician and Lecturer in Botany to the London Hospital, formerly Physician to the East London Hospital for Children. With 51 Illustrations. (" International Scientific Series.") London: Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Co., 1885. Pp. xx., 372. The term " expression " in this book denotes all movements that are signs of any state whatever of an organism animal or vegetable ; but it tends to become restricted in practice to miiovements that denote states of organic life rather thanl of mind. The author, however, desires by observation and analysis of " all physical phenomiiena coincident with the nianifestation of mind" to supply "a preliminary stepping-stone" to the study of mind itself. For " mind " he would prefer to substitute the term " mentation," by which he intends to describe all processes in the brain that are ac- companied by mental activity, without any hypothesis as to the nature of this activity in itself. The characteristic of the present set of researches is that, both by mnodified forms of the graphic method of studying movements already employed by other experimentalists and by the study of postures, he seeks to describe as accurately as possible various nutritive states of the organism; movements and postures, for example, of the hand (i' the energetic band," "the nervous hand," &amp;c.,) in health and in disease, in a low and in a high state of energy, in the sane and in the insane, being all referred to a normal or abnormial state of nuLtrition. Even in studying actions that are considered as signs of " mind " and not simply of " life," it is the modifications produced by different nutritive states of the brain that are analysed, rather than the nature of the movements as determined by the idea or feeling they express. These researches may on the whole be considered as preliminary to researchles such as those of Darwin in which movements of expression are considered in relation to the ends thev subserve, rather than as a stepping-stone to psychology in general. Sub- jective psychology the auithor does not profess to take into account ; he denies that there is any means of learning anything about "subjective conditions" except stutdy of their physical m-ianifestations. A special feature of the work is that much attention is devoted to the movements of expression in children. 30</page><page sequence="7">466 NEW BOOKS. Knowledge and Reality. A Criticism of Mr. F. H. Bradley's Principles of Logic. By BERNARD BOSANQUET, M.A., Late Fellow and Tutor of University College, Oxford. London: Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Co., 1885. Pp. xi., 333. The author, who wrote at some length on Mr. Bradley's doctrine of "Fact and Inference," in MIND XXXVIII., here offers a series of studies on other questions raised in the Principles of Logic; confiningr himself to topics of properly logical import. Mr. Bradley, he thinks, while being an effective pioneer in the present forward movemnent of English philosophy which seeks to assimilate what is really great in European philosophy, has, in some external matters and in some that are more than mere externals, attached himself, perplexingly, to writers of the present reaction in Germany, which, however it may serve a useful purpose there, can only work harm here if sympathy with it should restore the rule of traditions that we are just beginning to lay aside. The object, accordingly, is to show how Mr. Bradley's essential and original conception may be disengaged from some peculiarities which he apparently shares with reactionary logic ; also, in any case, to call attention to the leading ideas of a work " which deserves to be epoch-making in English philosophy ". The FundamentaZ Science. By HENRY JAMES CLARKE, A.K.C., Vicar of Great Barr, &amp;c. London: Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Co., 1885. Pp. xxiv., 265. "The fundamental Science " is concerned with the Infinite,- " a kind of existence which the conditions of our intellectual constitution preclude us from defining in relation to either Time or Space," but which can be "conceived" although not "iimagined ". No phenomenal series of causes and effects is complete in itself ; hence the phenomenal, the manifold, can only be explained as having its origin in " a Cause, Sinigle, Simple, and Eternal ". Unless the Infinite is created by the mind which coniceives it, it is recognised as somnething that is. " My recognition of it presupposes that it is cognoscible. If it is cognoscible, it may be expected to yield materials susceptible of investigation and available for the construction of a Science" (c. i., "Cognoscibility of the Infinite"). The creation of the world by the infinite Cause is to be conceived as a creation out of potenti- ality, not out of nothing (c. ii., " Origination"). The infinite Cause must be a "fundamental Will",(c. iii.),having a purposewhich can be characterised as " all-comprehending plan " (c. iv.); further, the human mind, being able to make the distinction of ought and ought not " has the capacity for ascrib- ing to the Fundamental Mind an ethical character " (c. vi.). Several chapters are devoted to discussion of the " Possibility of the Revelation of the Funda- mental Mind" (c. v.), " Testimonies to a Specific and Unique Historical Revelation " (c. vii.), " Divinely authenticated Signs and Wonders " (c. viii.), " Incarnate Manifestation of the Fundamental Character" (c. ix.), " Provi- dential Character of the Fundamental Government" (c. x.). Lastly some "Eschatological Conclusions" are drawn in the sense of liberal theology (C. xi.). Properties of Alctter. By P. G. TAIT, M.A., Sec. R.S.E.; formerly Fellow of St. Peter's College, Cambridge; Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh. Edinburgh: A. &amp; C. Black, 1885. Pp. viii., 320. The author, in the midst of his useful physical work continued in this volume, is as amusing as ever on the subject of the "metaphysicians," and has pressed one of them into the service of his playfuil humour. In an Appendix, pp. 286-91, Professor Flint furnishes a statement of twenty-five " Hypothe.</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS. 467 ses as to the Constitution of Matter," described by Professor Tait himself, p. 12 n., as " a remarkable collection of sueh (now historical) speculations ". " Now historical " is not meant for praise, and is a little hard upon Sir W. Thomson, who is one of the offenders. Professor Tait has also taken to quoting Kant, but evidently not with comfort, and is apt to drop him incontinently. There is some very queer "metaphysics" of his own in chap. i. "Introductory"; and his logic might be better. Thus we read at p. 4: " The objectivity of energy is virtually admitted in a curious way, by its being advertised for sale " ; but on p. 11 it is said: " To 'have its price' is not conclusive of objectivity, for we know that Titles, Family Secrets and even Degrees are occasionally sold ". This is not good logic. Scientific Romances, No. I. "What is the Fourth Dimension?" By C. H. HINTON, B.A. London: W. Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co., 1884. Pp. 32. A very suggestive and well-written speculation, by an inheritor of an honoured name. Urging the importance of supplementing " mechanical science by a just consideration of the constitution 'of the knowing faculty and the conditions of knowledge," he prefers not to ask directly, 'What is knowledge ?-What constitutes experience?' but to get out "beyond the horizon of actual experience " by the other way of " questioning whatever seems arbitrary and irrationally limited in the domain of knowledge ": in the present case, the limitation of the dimensions of space to three. He works out the main properties of four-dimensional space, as far as they can be inferred by analogy from the relation there is between actual space and (abstract) space of fewer dimensions, and then tries, in different ways, to determine " what relations beings in four dimensions, if tlhev did exist, would have with us ". Here is an interesting specimen of his manner " If we are in three dimensions only, while there are really four dimen- sions, then we must be, relatively to those beings who exist in four dimen- sions, as lines and planes are in relation to us. That is, we must be mere abstractions. In this case, we must exist only in the mind of the being that conceives us, and our experience must be merely the thoughts of his mind-a result which has apparently been arrived at, on independent grounds, by an idealist philosopher ". An Analysis of the Principles of Economics. Part I. By PATRICK GEDDES. Read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh 17th March, 7th April, and 7th July, 1884. London: Williams and Norgate, 1885. Pp. 40. The author's aim is to treat the subject matter of economical science (which is to be regarded as essentially a social science) according to the method of each of the preliminary sciences in succession. Froimi the point of view of physics (c. i.) producers and consumers are to be regarded as producing and consuming mechanisms ; the result of this nmode of con- sideration is that a far larger amount of productive labour has pleasurable stimulation (" aesthesis ") for its end than bare preservation. The in- troduction of biological considerations (c. ii.) shows how production may bring about either development or degradation of the individuals who produce and consume. In c. iii. (" Psychological Principles") the author argues that altruism as well as egoism must be taken into account by economical science among the motives of production. Profound Problems in Theology and Philosophy. By the Rev. GEORGE JAMIESON, B.D., Minister of the First Charge, Old Machar. Lon- don: Sirnpkin, Marshall &amp; Co., 1885. Pp. xxix., 629. This work, in nine Chapters (pp. 1-370), on Christian theology is</page><page sequence="9">468 NEW BOOKS. supplemented by twenty-five Excursuses on special topics, of which some are niore distinctively philosophical in character: "On the ground of Human Immortality" (398-404): "The Connexion of Body and Soul" (414-9): " The Psychological Problem " (483-524): " The Problem of Free-will in Man" (526-35): "The Processes of Mind" (545-56). The atuthor contends for a knowledge of Substance beyond phenomena- thus at p. 501: "There is a substance at the foundation of all being which deserves the name of spirit; and to see what is the connexion which subsists between the illinmitable substance so denominated and the terminal substance which we call matter, I say that the former, as primitive substance, has energy and generic quality as its inherent attributes; and that nmatter is in its proper foundations a specific quality thereof, originated in the form of atoms. . . . All this however has respect to but one fundamental side of spirit. This fundamental side, which I refer to as Ether, presents only the objective basis of primitive substance, which yields what we call matter. There is obviously a subjective or crowning basis of primitive substance, through which aloile we can account for the phenomena of mind." (1) Energy, Efficient and Final Cctuse. (2) Development; What it can do and what it cannot do. (3) A Criticism of the Critical Philosophy. (4) Herbert Spencer's Philosophy as culminated in his Ethics. (" Philosophic Series," II., III., VII., VIII.) By JAMES M'COSH, D.D., &amp;c., Presi- dent of Princeton College. Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1884. Pp. 55, 50, 60, 71. In the first of these pieces (continuing the Series begun by the earlier piece noticed in MIND XXXVII., 143) " an attemlpt is made to clear up the subject of Causation, which has become considerably confused ". " David Hume, in establishing his philosophical scepticism, laboured with all his might to loosen the causal connexion." Dr. M'Cosh's attempt to reverse the process consists in arguments to show that we have a " prirnitive cognition" of power in causes, both material and mental, to produce their appropriate effects. Five sections deal successively with " Physical Causation," " Psychical Causation," " Causation Subjective," " Various Sorts of Causes," and "Final Causes ". The auithor treats the theory of conservation of energy at some length, seeking not only to explain it but also to "keep it within its proper limits ". In the second piece the question is put, "What is the unity in Develop- ment?" The answer given is that developinent is "organised causation for ends,"; of which in nature there are two classes: (1) "general ends," such as the harmolny that is the result of the uniformity of law ; and (2) "special ends," consisting in the good of various kinds of living beings. The great scientific work of the past age has been to show what evolution can do; that of the coming age is to show what it cannot do. It cannot give an account of the origin of things ; it cannot explain the nature of the power that works in development; and it cannot of itself give us ends in nature. The appearance of new powers in the ages, of life and mind after inatter and of the higher faculties of the mind after the lower, is not explained by evolution. At the samie timiie " it is of no use denying in our day the doctrine of evolution in the name of religion or any other good cause The third and fourth pieces belong to the "historical" part of the Series, as the otliers to the "didactic" part. In the third Dr. M'Cosh expresses the opinion that the principles of Kant's ethics, " if carried into the region of speculative reason, would establish positive truth, without illusions of any kind," while " the pbhnomenal and illusory principles of</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS. 469 the Kritik of the Pure Reason, if carried out in a Kritik of the Practical Reason, would undermine moralitv ". The proper office of the metaphysib cian is not, as Kant says, " to purify the a priori principles by criticism," but to formulate these principles (or "intuitions" as Dr. M'Cosh would prefer to call them) "without addition or diminution ". Kant did not meet Hume's primary position, as he ought to have done, but accepted from him the " phenoinenal theory": the consequence of this first error of assuming scattered "impressions" on which the mind must impose its own forms, instead of asserting the self-evidence of the existence of a real self and real things outside, of which we know the prirmiary qualities " directly and immediately," is that Kant's system leads logically to idealism or to agnosticism, as is shown by the development it has undergone at the han(ds of his followers of different schools. " ' Back to Kant,' but back beyond him to what he looked to or should have looked to, and by which his views and ours are to be tested, to the facts of our mental nature." In criticising Mr. Spencer's philosophy, Dr. M'Cosh finds that " there is one areat omission in his enumeration of the original agents fronm which the actual phenomena of the world are developed. In this process he does not call in mind." Mr. Spencer, he thinks, "is successful in showinig that as geological ages have run oii there is a constant increase in the general amount of happiness". He has also established another point, " equally if not more important," viz., " that nature prepares for the intro- duction of morality ". The Data of Ethics, however, would have been better described as a Preparatio Ethicac; for although he has shown " that there are aids to human virtue in prearranerements to call it forth and maintain it," Mr. Spencer has " not entered the subject of ethics, which has to look to character and to voluntary acts of human beings ". Neither Mr. Spencer's philosophy nor that of Mill, whom also the author " had the courage to oppose when his reputation was at its greatest height," " meets the demands of our intellect or the cravings of our heart ". Heqel's Xsthetics. A Critical Exposition. By JOHN STEINFORT KEDNEY, S.T.D., Professor of Divinity in the Seabury Divinity School, Fari- bault, Minnesota; Author of The Beautiful and the Sublime. (" Griggs's Philosophical Classics.") Chicago: Griggs &amp; Co., 1885. Pp. xviii., 302. Parts i. and iii. of this volume are a condensed exposition of the corre- sponding parts of Hegel's XSsthetik, accompanied by criticisms, which are kept separate from the expository part of the book by enclosure in square brackets. The seconid part of the esthetik having been translated (by W. M. Bryant), the aiuthor has substituted for it "'an original disquisition, in language approaching nearer the vernacular, and with more immediate regard to present Eesthetic problems ; yet following also the patlhway marked out by Heg,el, and giving the substance of his thoughts ". The chief aim of this disquisition is to establish the distinction between the "subjective" (or variable) and the "objective" (or invariable) element ii tlle appreciation of works of art; between "the beauty which depends on the attractiveness of a state of things that is transitory " and " that which depends on the ultimate reality, which is permanent ". Appreciation of the first kind of beauty is the province of " the lower criticism" which occupies itself with the technical qualities of artistic work and the silb- jective impressi6n got from it; "the higher criticism " has for its province " whatever in the emotion of the beautiful can only be explained from the ideal of the ultimate perfection, which is the normal and essential consti- tution of the universe, is the common elenment in all subjectivity, and thus a part of the true objective ". The author goes on to expound the Hegelian</page><page sequence="11">470 NEW BOOKS. view of the historical development of art: showing how in the first or symbolic period "the spiritual is weighed down bv the corporal and material and struggles to be free"; how " in the classic period there is a momentary equilibrium" ; while in the third or romantic period " the spirit retires from nature, refuses its allegiance, and returns to it as ideally its master ". Outlines of Metaphysic. Dictated Portions of the Lectures of HERMANN LOTZE. Translated and edited, by GEORGE LADD, Professor of Philo- soplhy in Yale College. Boston: Ginn, Heatlh &amp; Co., 1884. Pp. xii., 166. Outlines of the Philosophy of Religion, &amp;c., as above. Translation edited, &amp;c., as above, 1885. Pp. viii., 155. A beginning is here made of translation of tlhe series of eiglht small volumes of Grundzige, giving the dictated portions of Lotze's courses of lectures, which have been noted in these pages as tlhey appeared in the original during the last three or four years. The series has had a very large sale in Germany, and English readers will, it is hoped, enable Prof. Ladd and his puiblishers to carry out their thought of adding to the pre- sent two volumes, with the Morcal Philosoph,y announced to follow before long, at least the Psychology, the Aisthetics and the Logic. No words are needed to commend such an enterprise, now that Lotze's importance as a thinker is so well understood. Prof Ladd has begun with the Meta- physic because of the fundamental importance attached by Lotze himself to this part of his philosophical scheme, following next with the Philo- sophy of Religion for reasons of convenience personal to himself as a teacher. The translation is careful and painstaking, but reads somewhat stiffly. Useful indexes are supplied. The Elements of Moral Science, theoretical and practical. By NOAH PORTER, D.D., LL.D., Presidelit of Yale College. London: Sampson Low, Marston &amp; Co., 1885. Pp. xxv., 574. The name "Moral Science," because it has "acquired a somewhat profounder signification," is used, rather than " Ethics," to describe the " consistent, articulated and finished system" in which it is here sought "to give the results of careful observations, subtile and exhaustive analy- ses, clear and careful definitions, verified inductions, logical deductions ". " Ethics," according to the author, " more commonly suggests what may be called arranged or classified rules of conduct or behaviour, as given for practical convenience, exclusive of any reference to fundamental principles or scientific grounds ". He does not, however, neglect such "Practice of Duty," reserving for it Part ii., after treating in Part i. the " Theory of Duty ". The topics of Part i. are-the Sensibilities; the WTill ; Character; the Intellect, its Functions in the Moral Activities and Experiences Moral Relations; the Moral Feelings; Ethical Definitions and Theories; Education and Development of the Moral Judgments and Feelings; Social Influences as Helps or Hindrances in Morals; the Law of Honour; the Conscience; Cases of Conscience ; the Christian Theory of Morals. Part ii. comprehends Duties to Ourselves; Duties to our Fellow-miien ; the Doctrine of Rights ; Duties of Truth or Veracity ; Duties of General Beneficence; Duties to Benefactors, Friends and Enemies ; Duties to Family an(d Kindred ; the State; Law and its Enforcement ; Duties to the State Duties to Animals ; Duties which respect the Physical World; Duties to God ; Special Religious Duties. The Philosophy of Ralph Cudworth. A Study of the Intellectual System of the Universe. By CHARLES E. LOWREY, A.M. New York: Phillips &amp; Hunt; Cincinnati: Cranston &amp; Stowe, 1884. Pp. 212.</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS. 471 The author, who writes from Ann Arbor, Michigan, gives in this "Study," after a few pages on Cudworth's life and works, (1) a sketch of "the Hobbes-Cartesian movement," which Cudworth sought to stem; (2) an account of Cudworth's argument against "Atheism"; (3) a statement of the " characteristics " of Cudworth's philosophy, ending with a view of his theory of knowledge as set out in the posthumouis Immutable Morality. The design is to work for the rescue of Cudworth from the neglect into which he has been suffered to fall and to induce an examination of the large mass of his unpublished MSS. in the B. Museium. The author has per- formed his task in a conscientious, if not particularly effective, manner, relying, outside of his author, on the original works of Descartes and Hobbes, and on various historical alnd critical authorities given in a list at p. 24. The most obvious and serious omission is of Principal Ttulloch's Rational Theoloqy atnd Christian Philosophy in England in the 17th Century, in which full justice had already been done to (Judworth, as also to the other Cambridge Platonists (here but slightly touched). Essais de Critique Philosophique. Par AD. FRANCK, Membre de l'Institut, Professeur au College de France. Paris: Hachette, 1885. Pp. xvii., 346. The doctrine of these Essays is, the author says, a spiritualism not "traditional," but " free and purely philosophical ". He protests against the ethical and metaphysical doctrines of the "contemporary English school," which exercises authority " nowhere more than in France ". The modern doctrine of evolution, he compares to the ideas of the alchemists; " the dreani of the transmutation of metals," he says, " deserves as much indulgence as that of the transmutation of species". This adherence to Cuvier's doctrine of the fixity of species appears especially in the first Essay (" L'Histoire naturelle dans l'Antiquit6 "), where Aristotle is praised for holding fast to the certainty of the existing distinctions among species, and "leaving hypothesis to his successors," and for his doctrine of final causes. It also influences the critical part of the review of M. Guyau's Morale anglaise contemporaine (ix.) and of M. Fouillee's Critique des Systemes de Morale contemporains (xi., " Un Revolutionnaire en Morale "). The historical Essays (the greater part of the book) are, perhaps, of more interest than those that treat of contemporary subjects, both as dealing with matters that are less familiar, and as having been written, for the most part, with no view to their bearing on any particular doctrine of the author. Among them may be selected for special nmention " La Philo- sophie Chr6tielne au troisienie Siecle" (a study of Origen), and "Le Mysticisme et l'Alchimie au seizieme Siecle " (a study of Cornelius Agrippa). In the first of these, the relations of Origen to Philo and to Clement of Alexandria are pointed out; his influence is traced up to the time of his condemlination; then it is shown how " Origenism " reappeared in a new form " in the heterodox theology and in the mllystical philosophy, even in the science of the West " ; finally, resemblances are shown to exist between the doctrines of Origen and of modern mystics on whom he has had no direct influence. The object of the study of Cornelius Agrippa is to show that he was not a sceptic like the Pyrrhonists of antiquity, or like Montaigne, for example, as has been supposed in consequence of a false interpretation of the treatise De Vanitate Scientiarum, but that he was a critic and a reformer (in religion as well as in science). There was much of the charlatan, the author admits, in Agrippa, but the inconsistencies of his character have prevented justice being done to his work. His notion of " magic " was not essentially different from that of Bacon ; it was the idea of a new scienice of nature. Apart from his scientific ideas and his views of religious reform, Agrippa's system is taken from the Hermetic; books and the Cabbala.</page><page sequence="13">4-72 NEW BOOKS. La Psychologie allemande contemporaine. (Ecole experimentale.) Par TH. RIBOT, Directeur de la Revue Philosophique. Deuxie'nie ltdition, corrigee et augmentee. Paris: F. Alcan, 1885. Pp. xxxiv., 380. M. Ribot's very serviceable account of present German psychology, originally published in 1879, is not a little altered and added to in this second edition. The net increase of 12 pp. gives no idea of the labour he has bestowed in incorporating with his exposition the main results of the last six years of active work recorded in periodicals like Prof. Wundt's Philosophische Studien or set forth in special monographs. Retrenchments at various points render the additions altogether very considerable. The overstrained declaration in favour of the physio-psychological, as against the introspective, method of investigation remains as it was in the Intro- duction; but in spite of the aiithor's exaggeration at this point, his work in general is much to be commended, and a good translation of it would go far to fill a gap that still renlains in English psychological literature. Du Langaage et de la Musique. Par S. STRICKER, Professeur a l'Universite de Vienne. Traduit de l'Allemand par FREDERIC SCHWIEDLAND. Paris: F. Alcan, 1885. Pp. 180. For this French translation of his Studien iiber die Sprachvorstellungen (noticed in MIND XIX. on its appearance) the author has made some additions, of which the most important are c. 22 (" On the Representation of Musical Sounds ") and pp. 33-46 of c. 5. This last passage contains a fuller discussion of the researches of Fritsch, Hitzig and Ferrier than was thought necessary in the first edition. In order to meet the opposition of Goltz, Dr. Stiickei has repeated many of the experiments of those physio- logists, and on the ground of his results maintains the theory of the sepa- ration of motor from sensory centres in the cerebrum. He finds that physiological experiments andc pathological observations alike confirm the conclusion at which he had arrived psychologically that " pure representa- tions " of words consist of motor and not of sensory images. In the new chapter on musical sounds he contends that the lmotor element is ftundamental in representations of tones as in representations of words. The acoustic element in music corresponds to colour in pictures, the motor element to drawing: and as in the blind the sense of form-which may be appealed to by raised outlines-is detached from that of colour, so in a (comparatively) non-musical person the motor representations becoilme detached (in memory) from acoustic representations ; even in the non- musical, however, these last predominate at the time, while musicians also have what they call "abstract" representations of melodies, which are really motor representations. The arguments of Stumpf and Henle against this view are discussedJ; the author contending that in admitting that melodies can be represented in an "abstract" manner they in effect concede his position. The dlistinction he ha(l made between movements of articulation properly so called and laryngeal movements is applied to the case of musical sounds ; " internal song" is independent of change in the position of the larynx. Dr. Stricker is disposed to believe that the tensor /Iiu'i,li plays an important part in the hearing especially of sounds of I iIi Iit Il,. Le Sommeil et les Reves considJre's principcalement dans leurs Rapports avec les T'he'ories de la Certitude et de la Memoire. Par J. DELBEUF, Professeur a l'Universite de Liege. "Le Principe de la Fixation de la Force." Paris: F. Alcan, 1885. Pp. 262. After a critical review of the works of other writers on sleep and dreams (Introduction, pp. 1-53), the author discusses the relation of dreams first to the theory of certitude (pp. 55-102) and then to the theory of memory</page><page sequence="14">NEW BOOKS. 473 (pp. 103-253). In dream, as distinguishedl alike from the waking-state and from reverie, there is abselnce of any perceptions from which the " conceptions " (i.e., images) that are passing through the mind can be dis- tinguished. Having acquired in waking-life the habit of referring our perceptions to an exterilal object we make a similar reference of our conceptions. in dreams; hence the element of illusion. The testimoiny of others is the only criterion of perception as distinguished from conception, and this is not infallible ; there is always room for doubt. " Speculative doubt," a doubt " purely theoretical " applied to things of which we have at bottom no doubt, "is the appanage of a mind in full possession of its reason and is at the same time the sufficient and absolute distinctive sign of reasoned certitude ". In laying the foundation of his theory of memory as " the fixation of force," the author discusses at some length the doctrine of the transformation of physical forces. He argues that through the tendency of all forces to equilibrium the "transformability of force" will at length be practically exhausted ; the universe inust approach indefinitely nearer to a state in which there is uniform distribution of heat and no movement of translation. Organisms fix external force in their substance in the form of a state of eqtuilibrium more or less complete. The cause of sleep is accumulation, not expenditure, of force ; for, granted that we expend force in acquiring, say, a piece of knowledge, tlhe effect of this expenditure is to fix in the brain other forces in the shape of ideas. An organism may be regarded as consisting of a " central nucleus ' of an- cestral ancd personal habits, and, round this nucleus, of concentric layers on which are impressed as on photographic plates images perceived during each day's existence in the past. In the waking-state there is always a " peripheral layer " which alone remains capable of fixing external forces in the form of memories. When the sensibility of the "periphlery" (which need not, of course, be physically the superficies of the organism) is exhausted, sleep arrives; psychically nothing now exists but memories and habits ; present impressions have practically disappeared with the exhaus- tion of selisibility. During sleep the peripheral sensibility is reconstituted. The author contends that irothing that has once been impressed on the sensibility ever disappears. He shows (especially from a dream of his own of which he recorded the details accurately at the time and had to seek for an explanation during a loilg subsequent period) how some momentary impression that in waking-life appears to have been completely forgotten, mav be revived in a dream: hence the importance of sleep and dreams for the theory of muemory. Among isolated observations may be men- tioned (1) the remark that what appears to be metamorphosis of objects in dreams is often only substitution and not transformation of images ; (2) the explanation of the class of dreams in which the solution of a problem insoluble for the dreamer is attributed to another person, as "ldramatisa- tion " of the habit of thinking in dialogue ; and (3) the attribution of the circumrstan6e that we may ' dream we are dreaming" to the habit of making the distinction between dream and reality in waking-life and the persistelice of this, as of all habitual modes of thought, in sleep. La Philosophie ancienne. Histoire generale (le ses SystQmes. Par CH. BE'NARD, Ancien Professeur de Pliilosophie dans les Lycees de Paris et a l'Ecole normale superieure. Premiiere Partie. Paris: F. Alcan, 1885. Pp. cxxviii., 398.

In opposition equally to the schools that reject metaphysics altog,ether and to those that class it with art and religion as distinguished from science, he contends that the scientific character denied to mneta- physics is precisely wlhat distinguishes it from art and religion ; that truth, in the strictly scientific sense, has been present from the first in philo- sophical systems; that this element of truth, once brought to light, is independent of the genius of those who created the systems; and that the truth of each system survives and becomes an integral part of human thought. Thus there has been real progress in philosophy as in the positive sciences: and a modern critic and historian of philosophy, unless he is incompetent, occupies a position from which he can pass judgments equally secure with those of historians and critics generally. In two sections that follow the general Introduction (xlix.-cxxviii., "Les Limites et les Antec6dents de la Philosophie ancienne," " L'Orient et la Sagesse orientale ") M. Benard shows in what way mythology, poetry, gnomic sentences, &amp;c., influenced ancient philosophy, and, while giving a short sketch of the chief Oriental philosophies, maintains that Greek philosophy was almost entirely self-developed. He denies, indeed, that there is anything that can, in strictness, be called an Oriental philosophy. There are in Egypt and the East no systems marked with an inidividual character ; everything is vague, imilpersonal, and gelnerally of doubtfil authorship. Above all the influence of positive science and the scientific spirit is absent: wlhat is called the philosophy of India, for example, is a means of redemption of the individual soul from evil, aln(d thus is subsi- diary to religion; although it contains philosophical elements it is not disinterestedl cnorigh to be called a philoso-phy. The present volume only deals with pii-5 ia tic philosophy, with Socrates and with the founders of " the minor Socratic schools," i.e., all those who were directly inspired by Socrates except Plato ; but the plan of the work includes the history of philosophy to the closing of the schools by Justinian. The volume ends with a sttuldy of the Sophists (pp. 247-395). Modern criticism, as re- presented by Grote on the one hand and Hegel on the other, has, the author admits, for the first time explained the part of the Sophists in the movement of Greek thought; but in attempting their rehabilitation he maintains that it has gone too far. The scepticism of the Sophists was necessary in order to effect the transition from tlle philosophy of the pre- Socratic schools with its search for physical principles to the philosophy of Socrates and his successors with its investigation of human nature; but they themiiselves, like the ancients genlerally, were unconscious of this- they were only concerned to teach thle art of making the appearance of truth pass for the truth itself which they did not believe to exist. This is the judgment passed on them equally by Xenophoii, by Plato and by Aristotle, and accepted by all the centuries up to the present. Whatever may be determined as to their historical function this judgment on their character cannot be reversed. L'Origqine dei Fenorn?eni psichici e loro Signiftcazione biologica. Di G. SERGI, Prof. di Antropologia nell' Universith Romana. (CC Biblioteca Scientifica Internazionale.") Milano: Dumolard, 1885. Pp. xxv., 454. In the present volume the author is more concerned with general principles and less with any special line of researcll than in his former work La Teorica fisiologica della -Percezione (noticed in MIND XXV.). He has also in view the practical bearing of his doctrine, its religious and (to some extent) social applications ; inideed it is on this that he lays most stress. Psychical tunctions are to be considered simply as functions of the organism; that is the only scientific way of treating them. Psychology is</page><page sequence="16">NEW BOOKS. 475 that branch of biology which (from its own point of view, however, and not from that of physiology) treats of the "protective" functions of sen- sation and motion (" wsthokinesis ")-the functions of " relation" as distinguished from those of nutrition and reproduction. " Sensibility " is a universal function of organic matter ; in its lowest stage it is identical with irritability; it then becomes "unconscious" and aiterwarcis "con- scious " sensibility, acquiring its specific character in nervous tissue. Throughout the whole course of evolution mind has for its finction " protection in the struggle for existence ". Since it is connected with all other functions as the nervous system is connected with all other organs, " mind " must not be isolated fromn "life ". In the earlier, chapters of the book (cc. i.-viii., 1-135) this view is set forth in its generality ; then the author goes on to consider the psychical functions "in the animal series" (cc. ix.-xi., 137-247) and "in the human races" (cc. xii.-xv., 249-426), supporting his conclusions always by the results of the most recent investigations. " Pleasure and Pain" (c. xvi.) are described as the primi- tive form of the protective function, and as derivatives of the tendency to self-preservation inherent in all matter. The short concluding chapter (e. xvii.) states briefly the author's doctrine in its application to practice (insisted on throughout): "the protection of man, as individual and as species, alone or collectively, comes only from man," who is to obtain it by scientific knowledge of himself, of society and of nature. Die Entstehung des Gewissens. Von Dr. PAUL RTE. Berlin: Duncker (C. Heymons), 1885. Pp. 253. The author, wvho has already published an essay on the origin of the moral feelings (see MIND VIII.), now seeks to trace the origin of con- science, which he describes (rather than defines, since " an exact definition" would be more exact than that which men understand by conscience) as consisting in approval or -disapproval of feelings and actions classed as moral or immoral. Egoistic and altruistic feelings such as love and hate, pity and malevolence, have always existed in man ; but approval and dis- approval of these feelings as " good " or " bad " have their origin in assign- able causes: and it is by this approval and disapproval that both feelings and actions acquire their specific moral quality ; no intensification of the feeling of compassion itself, which Schopenhauer, for example, re-ardl aP the essential element in morality, would make it a distinctively a -.i- 1 . i! i . By a historical explanation of conscience, the belief in a supernatural cause of phenomena hitherto inexplicable will be driven from its last retreat. The explanation is found in commands imposed by the State and in penalties attached to disobedience. Limits were imposed by the State on the action of individuals for the sake of maintaining peace, which was constantly broken when everyone was allowed to avenge inj uries done to himself. Revenge is not, as has been said, a kind of "primitive justice"; words with strictly ethical connotation only arise after the idea of punishment has become associated with actions that are at first felt by those whlo suffer from them simply as unpleasant and not as " wrong ". In the formation of conscience, religious sanc- tions have added their influence. Men ascribe to the anthropomorphic godis they have created approval and disapproval of actions they have themselves learnt to approve or disapprove. Thus, although laws do not, as the ancients thought, come originally from heaven, they may be said to " return from heaven ". The founders of new religions have transformed morality by ascribing their own philanthropic dispositions to the gods and representing their own judgmiients as of divine origin. The special character of moral judgments ceases to be in any respect enigmatical when</page><page sequence="17">476 NEW BOOKS. we keep in mind the distinetion between the individual alld the race. Customary modes of thinking having been impressed by education (in all its forms, social, religious, &amp;c.), their origin is forgotten: hence, that which historically is a " hypothetical imperative" becomes for the inidividual a "c ategorical imperative ". The seinse of justice, the feeling that retribu- tion is due for actionrs condeimned as " bad,, is now seen to be a product of customary association. Punishment (and hence even accidental con- sequences of actions condemned by conscience), through a kind of " optical illusion," is regarded by those who are punished as a necessary consequence of the past, while it is really inflicted with a view to the future advantage either of the person punished or of others. There are three kinds of repentance: (1) strictly "moral" repentance due to the disapproval of conscience; (2) that which springs from the feeling of pity; (3) " egoistic" repentance, or that which springs from fear of consequences. Of these kinds the last is the strongest, the first by far the weakest. Conscience is like a constitutional king: " it reigns, it is almost honoured as a god, but it does not govern" ; the egoistic or altruistic disposition that is pre- dominant really governs, as in a parliamentary state the party that happens to have the majority of votes. This being so, the demonstration that the categorical imperative really originates in experiences of utility to the race will have little influence on-practice. But in anv case it is not to be con- cealed that a purely theoretical investigation of conscielnce ends in the con- clusion that the feeling of absolute obligation " remains with us, like the hero in the fable, only so long as we ask no questions about its parentage". Lehrbuch der Psychologie vom Statndpunkte des Realismus und nach genetischer Methode. Von Ph. Dr. WILHELM VOLKMANN RITTER VON VOLKMAR, weil. o. 6.

Cornelius of Halle, who has had charge of this second edition of the deceased W. Volkmann's great work (third edition, if the original smaller Grundriss of 1856, out of which the Lehrbuch grew by 1875-6, is counted as first), has been able to comiplete his revisioln within the time announced upon issue of Vol. i., as mentioned in our notice of that volume (MIND XXXVII., 146). His additions, mainly but not exclusively biblio- graphical (see, for example, the long Note under ? 111, o'n " Apperception ") increase the body of the present volume by 14 pp.; furtlher, the " Cata- logue of Works cited," giveln at the end, now occupies 23 pp., instead of the 10 pp. within which Volkmnann had (by omissions) confined it. One feature of the previous edition is fortunately absent-the appalling list of "Misprints " by which it was disfigured. In its now inmproved form, the Lehrbuch is, without exception, the most useful, because most conmpre- hensive, treatise that any psychological student or worker can have by himii. Its value, however, is by no means confined to its comprehensive fulness ; the author having been no inere compiler, but a powerful systema- tiser if not also anl indepelndent inquirer. We hope, at sonle later time, to be able to do j istice to its merits in these pages. Katechismus der Geschichte. der Philosophie. Von Thales bis zur Gegenwart. Von Lic. Dr. FRIEDR.

In a second " im- proved " ed-ition, there should not have been left, if given in the first, such curious jottings upon English thinkers as that "Henry Lewes and G.

STERN. Leipzig: Th. Grieben (L. Fernau), 1885. Pp. 348. In order to make room for philosophy in thle special sense, it is necessary at the present time to show that natural science is incompetent to give a general view of the world. Scientific facts and doctrines fluctuate too much for it to be possible to found a philosophy on them: philosophy must, therefore, seek truths independent of all changes in the theories and results of the natural sciences. There are strictly philosophical questions, the solution of which is independent of everything in natural science, although, at the same time, many results of natural science give indications as to the right solution of metapllysical problems (Part i., pp. 15-204, " Metaphysische Vorbegriffe "). The conceptions by means of which we explain the world to ourselves are subjective and do not express the reality of things, but only correspond to it. According to this view, however, knowledge is still possible; for when we have established a distinction in the world of phenomena we know that there is an objective distinction corresponding to it, although we do not know the real nature of that dis- tilnction. By investigation of consciousness, we can obtain a result of unconditional validity as regards the nature of the soul (Part ii., pp. 205- 260, "Die Seelenfrage"). Analysis of phenomnena shows that there must be a real distinction of substance corresponding to the phenomenal distinction between consciousness and matter. Natural science, therefore, may settle all questions that lie within the limits of the natural w,orld, but not go a, step beyond. Thus, there can be a scientific monism taking into its view the whole of nature while it excludes consciousness ; but monism in the complete philosophical sense is unattainable. The unconditionally valid result of philosophy, as regards the soul, can be brought into harmony with the doctrine of evolution (Part iii., pp. 261-312, " Menschliches und thierisches Bewusstsein ") and with the last results of physiology (Part iv., pp. 313-348, "Gehirnentwicklung und Denkfbihigkeit"); for however much thought may be dependent on relations of matter in the brain, and whatever reciprocal action of the soul and matter there may be, thought is still not identical with motion or with any other relation of portions of matter to one another. Prolegromena zu Forschungen uber die Finheit des Geisteslebens in Bewusstsein und That der ]enschheit. Von RUDOLF EUCKEN, Professor in Jena. Leipzig: Veit, 1885. Pp. 113. This book, as the title indicates, is only introductory to the author's philosophical system. Here he states his principle and his method, but not his results. According to the principle laid down, a philosophical explanation of things must take the form of an expression of the activity,</page><page sequence="19">478 NEW BOOKS. both speculative and practical, of the mind as a whole. The method o philosophy is not to be "'psychological" but "no6logical ". The psycho logical (or purely historical) miethod is a necessary preliminary to philoso phy, but does not itself answer questions that are properly philosophical it is content to set forth the actual sequence of phenomena withoul determining their inner relations. The author recurs to an idea he ha, already developed in his Geschichte der philosophischen Terminologie (noticed in MIND XIII.) and elsewhere, viz., that since the philosophical conceptions that are active at present sum up the results of past thought, a critical study of their history must of itself determine in great part the true direction of modern speculation. What antiquity and the Middle Ages expected from "metaphysics," the modern period expects from "theory of knowledge ". Aristotle's metaphysics was not pure ontology, but was in relation to Greek life, and was of value just because it was aln expression of actual life. Scholasticism turned the conceptions of Aristotle into a system of pure abstractions; and the daniger of philosoplly still is that it should be too abstract and out of relation to human life. The modern conceptioni of " theory of knowledge " is to be adopted so far as it makes clear the necessity of a fundamental investigation of mind; but such a ftndamental investigation ought not to be exclusively an investiga- tion of "knowledge for itself," btit of the activity of the mind as a con- nected whole. The true aim of philosophy is not to force " the living content of existence " into categories as colourless as possible, but to be an expression of mental activity in its fulness, and thus, without becoming "a characterless eclecticism," to leave room for the different views of the world and directions of activity that proceed from differences of per- sonality. Wahrheit aus meinem Leben. Von CARL LUDWIG MICdIELET. Nebst zwei Lichltbildern und vier Stammtafeln. Berlin: Nicolai'sche Verlags- Buchhandlung (R. Stricker), 1884. Pp. x., 548. The distinguished Hegelian, who has now passed his eightieth year, gives an account in this volume not only of his personal life and experi- ences, but of the various movements, philosophical, literarv and political, in which he has taken part. His aim has been to give a purely objective view both of himself and of the events of his life, rather than, like Goethe, to describe the effect of his experiences on himself ; the intention so far as possible to exclude all mixture of Dichtung with WcVhrheit is indicated in the title. In his effort to be exact the author has been aided by having adopted, from an early period, the habit of committing to paper notes of the more important circumstances of his life. He refrains from passing judgment on himself except in the last chapter, entitled " My Individual Character". Here he describes his life as having consisted in a series of conflicts between himself and his surroundings and between the different sides of his character ; yet life, he says, does not end in a conflict but in a reconciliation. And this conflict followed by union of opposites does not take place simply in the mind of the philosopher, but is in the nature of things. It is a universal experience that the world really contradicts itself, and after having come to rest in a mean position falls into new contradictions which have to be again resolved, till at length the highest contradictions are brought into union. Crundziuge der Metaphysik. Von Dr. KONRAD DIETERICH, o. Professor der Philosophie an der Universitit Wiirzburg. Freiburg i. B. u. Tiubin- gen: J. C. B. Mohr (Paul Siebeck), 1885. Pp. 85. The autlhor aims at giving tlhe general results of modern philosophical</page><page sequence="20">NEW BOOKS. 479 thought since Kant. His own metaphysical view has been most influenced by the revived monadism of Lotze. "Pure Metaphvsic" (Part i.) is divided by him into (1) doctrine of the logical laws according to whicli we distinguish true being and occurrence from false ; (2) doctrine of the forms of intuition in which all objectively valid things and events are represented by us; (3) doctrine of the forms of feeling in which the representations of single things and events are given as real facts. The distinction that rins through this part is that of " being " from events that take place in "real beings". Neither of these kinds of "actuality" can be deduced from the other. For the being of things " the law of inherence," the law that all events are changes in persistent substances, is the fundamental law ; for the succession of events, "' the law of causation". Absolutely, the real beilng to which all events are related is one; but from this absolute unity a relative plurality may be deduced. Part ii. ("Applied Metaphysic") is divided into two sections dealing respectively with "Metaphysic of Nature " and " Metaphysic of Spirit ". The metaphysic of nature bas to determine (1) the simplest elements of the conception of miiatter, (2) the conception of mechanical connexion, (3) the law of development. Atomis and their motions are not realities outside us, bLut simple elements of appearances in space and changes of these appearances; yet they present to us an image of the real world. There is a real reciprocal action of "metaphysical atoms" corresponding to the reciprocal action of physical atoms which we represent to ourselves in space. In order to assign its meaning to the idea of an evolution of the whole world, we need a teleo- logical view that shall include both nature and spirit. The problem of "the metapbysic of spirit" is to combine the results of "the empirical sciences of mind " with the results of pure metaphysic. The union of the idea of teleological connexion (combination, as distinguished from modifi- cation, of given feelings and presentations by the free activity of the soul) with the idea of mechanical connexion according to the law of cause and effect, forms a reconciliation of the doctrine of freedom of the will with this law. Thus the relation between free development of the soul on the one hand and psychical mechanism on the other is identical with the relation between teleological connexion and mechanical connexion generally. Die Itclienische Philosophie des neunzehnten fahrhunderts. Von Dr. KARIJ WERNER. Erster Band: "A. Rosminii und seine Schule" ; Zweiter Band: " Der Ontologismus als Philosophie des nationalen Gedankens. (Gioberti, Mamiani.)" Wien: G. P. Faesy, 1884-5. Pp. xv., 472; xv., 426. In these two volumes the author gives an elaborate account of the philosophical svstems of Rosmini, Gioberti and Mamiani. The philosophy of this grotup of writers is described as part of a movement of return of Italian thought to its true basis in Catholicism; the other parts of the general movement being the literary and political movements of the early part of the century. Malizoni, for example, as the auithor mentions, found in Rosmini's writings, wben he became acquainted with tbem, the philosophical ground of his own artistic activity and of that of the Italian Romiiantic school. Just as Italian literature became more national in passing frqm Classicism to Romanticism, so Italiain speculative thought became more national in throwing off the influence of the English and Freuich philosophy of the last centuiry and returning to the Catholic philosophy of the Middle Age. The political side of this national movement, the author thinks, injured its intellectual effectiveness. There was a break between the religious and the political consciousness; for the</page><page sequence="21">480 NEW BOOKS. expression of the national ideal in practical politics became inconsistent with its remaining a Catholic ideal. Thus in place of a common effort towards the reconciliation of scientific knowledge and faith, towards the regenerative transformation of modern thought in the light of the Catholic idea,-an effort which should have acted first of all on the moral nature and left social and political changes to follow,-there is now on the one side a reactionary Thomism and on the other a philosophy inconsistent with Catholicism. " The new Thomism " must give up its purely negative attitude so far as the undeniable acquisitions of modern research (and these not merely in physical science) require, and must make its speculative ideas comprehensive enough to embrace all the results of thought since the Scholastic period: but in the end everything will be found reconcilable with the Catholic idea.
