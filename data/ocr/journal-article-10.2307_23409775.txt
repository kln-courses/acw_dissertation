<plain_text><page sequence="1">Continuity and Change in the Art of the Sulka of Wide Bay, East New Britain, Papua New Guinea1 THE PURPOSE OF THIS paper is to explore the con tinuity and change in Sulka art over the past 80 years. The research methods employed within include field study of Sulka art using photographs of early museum objects and art in early ethno graphic contexts. Also this study uses contemporary Sulka art from the 1980s as the basis for comparison with early Sulka art.2 In a recent paper (Corbin 1990) entitled "Salvage art history among the Sulka of Wide Bay, East New Britain, Papua New Guinea," I analyzed the results of interviewing 28 Sulka big-men using 27 pho tographs of early Sulka art in museums and in ethno graphic contexts.5 The results suggested that there were at least five types of large hemlaut masks, seven types of susu masks, two types of decorated dance wands, two types of war shields, eight types of war clubs, two types of men's house carvings, and two types of decorated plank-built canoes made by the Sulka during the years 1900 to 1928. This paper will briefly introduce selected exam ples of early Sulka masks, dance wands, mens house carvings, clubs, and war shields, and then compare and contrast them stylistically and iconographically with Sulka art made as recently as 1980-1983. The "Salvage art history" paper was limited to pho tographs of Sulka art actually shown to Sulka infor mants, whereas this study uses comparative analysis of style and meaning to illustrate and explain addi tionai early Suika held photos and art objects among a corpus of several hundred studied in museums around the world.4 Masks Hemlaut Masks One of the most impressive mask forms found in most early collections of Sulka art is a huge, woven, sculptural form terminating in an elaborately paint George A. Corbin Department of Art, Lehman College and the Graduate Center (CUNY) ed, umbrella-like form placed on top of a vertical strut. These masks are known throughout the Sulka area (and in the literature) as hemlaut, meaning old man."5 The type is found throughout the Sulka in Wide Bay (Figs.i and 2) as well as among the neigh boring Tomuip, Sulkanized Mengen, and Mengen peoples. The five hemlaut masks illustrated here (Figs.3 through 7) include three Field Museum of Natural History (Chicago) pieces collected by A. B. Lewis during his 1909-1913 expedition to New Britain, a Museum für Völkerkunde, Hamburg piece (Fig. 6) from 1908-1910, and a hemlaut mask (Fig.7) photographed by Gregory Bateson in 1928.^ in the hrst Hemlaut mask, (rig.3) from the Held Museum of Natural History (FMNH), the cone shaped lower part of the mask (mnekiet) extends into a connecting strut (stuck), which holds up an elab orately-painted umbrella-like form (elpek). The entire lower surface of the umbrella shape is paint ed with geometric and symmetrical patterns in dark Figure ι. Map of East New Britain and Southern New Ireland, Papua New Guinea, including the Sulka and neighboring language groups, (after Chowning 1976 and Wurm 1975) July 1996 ι</page><page sequence="2">and light pigments known as riteak (writing). There are two circular shell rings (a pek, singular, alopek, plural) suspended on either side of the lower cone shape, as well as thin strands of shell money. The inclusion of these forms of wealth and currency sug gests that this hemlaut may have been used in initi ations, marriages, or mourning feasts (nek) where the Sulka commonly display their wealth. The long, dark-green leaves (wok) beneath the mask served to cover the masker to a point near his knees. Shorter and broader yellow-colored leaves (powan) were also attached at the point or connection between the mask and the costume to provide a striking color contrast. The geometric patterns on either side of the lower part of the umbrella are called krien and they served as eye-catching devices to make observers notice the painted patterns. The repeated four-part patterns on the bottom of the umbrella were identified as a wild palm leaf design called vreck. The decorative edging of light parrot feathers around the outside of the umbrella are known as plang-pupu. Figure 2. Map of Sulka villages on Wide Bay in East New Britain.

(photo courtesy of the Museum) In a second FMNH hemlaut mask (Fig.4) there is an additional sculptural element, aside from the cone-shaped lower form and umbrella shape. A pair of woven pith birds sit on a thin, circular platform about half-way up the cone. Sulka informants were unable to identify the species of bird represented. However, they did suggest that it was most likely a representation of a clan emblem that was created as a sculptural shape on hemlaut masks.7 The broad yellow-colored leaves (powan) and the long, dark green leaves of the costume are clearly seen in this early field photograph. No informants were able to identity the patterns painted under the umbrella shape. However, the saw-tooth-like pattern on the outer edge was called lalkien by several informants. The third FMNH hemlaut mask (Fig.5) has an abbreviated cone shape on the bottom which is said to represent a wild taro plant (kakal) with a huge praying mantis (kovio) standing on top. The umbrel la is painted with patterns that represent the wings and claws of the mantis. Two mantis claw shapes protrude from the lower section of the taro shape. Sulka from Iwai village claimed that one of their clans (the Porgwan clan) had the copyright to use the praying mantis as their clan emblem and that a man named Mtukio (now deceased) had made sim ilar hemlaut masks as recently as the late 1940s.® This 2 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="3">Figure 4.

(photo courtesy of the Museum) particular view of the hemlaut mask (with the umbrella thrust backward to make the painted pat terns more visible) corresponds to a formal dance posture in which the dancer stops and allows the audience to see the painted patterns and sculptural forms more clearly. If the members of the audience like the dancers movements and the artistic forms they will reward him afterward with various gifts in appreciation of his accomplishments.9 Another type of hemlaut mask has an anthropo morphic lower form instead of a cone shape and exists in single- and double-figure types. A double figure type in the Museum für Völkerkunde Hamburg (Fig. 6) is unusual because two men stood next to each other and danced in tandem. Known throughout the Sulka and Sulkanized Mengen areas as "Lopela" (two-fella), this mask type was said to have been made as recently as just prior to the Second World War.10 The hair on the two heads is cassowary feathers (msasin). The pierced earlobes and noses, as well as the blackened teeth, all refer to body deformations undergone by young Sulka Figure 5. Sulka hemlaut mask with praying mantis form.

The decorated bulge near the bottom of each of the two bodies is said to rep resent a welt from cutting (the skin?) and the pat terns painted on these bulges may represent the crest pattern found on top of a hornbill's beak. The anthropomorphic shape(s) beneath the umbrella are called nunu (reflection or human-like). The term nunu is used whenever the Sulka describe a human like sculptural form or painted pattern. A combination of anthropomorphic and serpent like forms beneath an umbrella shape (Fig.7) can be seen in a hemlaut mask photographed by Gregory Bateson during his fieldwork among the Sulka in 1928.11 Sulka informants identified the painted pat terns beneath the umbrella as either patterns from a wild palm lear or crayfish claws (galugio, plural). 1 he monstrous mouth of the lower anthropomorphic shape is said to be a supernatural serpent called Kot. Kot is said to manifest himself as a python on land and as a sea snake around reefs. The pouian and wok leaves are clearly identifiable in the photograph as well.12 In recent years the Sulka have made very few hemlaut masks. A single hemlaut mask often takes several months to make and only very important ceremonies warrant the long-term investment of time, energy, and manpower needed to create a hem laut mask. However, the two hemlaut masks illus Figure 6. Sulka hemlaut mask called Lopela from the Museum für Völkerkunde, Hamburg, Museum #6425, collected 1908-1910. (Corbin negative Figure 7. Sulka hemlaut mask with monstrous anthropomortphic/serpent form beneath the umbrella. A 1928 field photograph by Gregory Bateson. American Museum of Natural photograph, (by permission of the late Gregory Bateson) trated here (Figs.8 and 9) clearly indicate that the Sulka were still making them as recently as the early 1980s. If we compare and contrast two recent hemlaut masks (Figs.8 and 9), made by Sulka men at Milim and Pomnekier (near the Guma Mission) respec tively, we can see a hemlaut (from Milim) that is fully traditional in form and decoration and an acculturated one (from Pomnekier). The photo graph of the Milim hemlaut was made by Monique Ballini in 1980 during her fieldwork among the Sulka.1^ One of the makers of the Milim hemlaut, named Magil (Kaimun clan), used a pattern on the bottom of the umbrella virtually identical to the pat tern on the bottom of the hemlaut in Bateson's 1928 photo (Fig.7), which was identified as representing a wild palm leaf pattern. In the second hemlaut, made by Kampal (Letun clan), the patterns on the bottom of the umbrella were painted on cloth rather than on the intricate radiating forms of the umbrel la. This technique of painting on cloth attached to the sculptural form is commonly found in recent times and can also be seen on some susu masks. This hemlaut was made as part of the one-hundred-year 4 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="5">Figure 8. Sulka hemlaut mask with painted umbrella form.

Therefore, Kampul felt that Christian symbolism was appropriate and he creat ed a double-chalice motif on the bottom. Decorative geometric shapes were set around the double chal ice to emphasize them. In addition, the triangular patterns around the outside edge represent butter flies (kiering). The lower cone section of the hem laut, in contrast, is purely traditional in form and decoration. Susu masks The second type of mask found throughout the Sulka is known as susu and in early collections sev eral distinct sculptural types are known. A very com mon type consists of a woven pith, with a cone shaped lower section surmounted by a large cone-shaped piece (see Fig.io for two versions of susu masks).

This type is called to-ka-ti and is one of the most frequently seen types in pre-World War-One collections around the world. This cos tume uses only one type of leaf in contrast to the two types used in the hemlaut mask. The leafy costume, known as wok, is made of long multiple skirts from the head to below the knees of the masker. The leaves used in this costume are the same dark green ones used on hemlaut masqueraders. The decorative fringe on the susu in the left side of the photograph is called maqien and appears to be made of parrot feathers. The longer feathers on top of the right hand susu mask are most likely parrot feathers as well. A second type of susu mask in the Museum für Völkerkunde, Hamburg, (Fig.ii), is most likely a variation on the to-ka-ti type susu masks seen in Figure ίο. The cone-shaped upper part is similar to the FMNH pieces, although the lower half is more elaborately sculpted as a flattened cone shape with a pair of decorative zig-zag borders and complex painted patterns. The upper half of the cone is Figure 12. A susu mask surmounted by a carved and painted bird with outstretched wings. Museum fiir Völkerkunde, Hamburg. Museum #12135.255 (collected by Thiel). (Corbin negative #1982.6.15) wrapped with twisted fern leaves, thereby creating a slighdy rough and green surface (in its original form before drvine out). Informants said that the oatterns on the lower half represented the intestines (kavrick) of a pig. This complex susu mask was described as a lead mask in important ceremonies.*5 In the Museum für Völkerkunde, Hamburg, susu mask in Figure 12 the lower cone shape has a pair of upward-curved extensions near its mid-point and a carved and painted bird with outstretched wings surmounting a strut on top. Some Sulka sug gested that the large bird-form on top represented a large white bird (called kaeng) that flies along the shoreline on Wide Bay. While others only called it "big bird" (animenglaut)—one of the dual-clan clas sifications found among the Sulka (big and small bird). The upward-curved shapes were called ρ raga (a name given to any long-pointed extension com ing off the surface of a mask.) The geometric pat terns painted on the wings and body of the bird were frequently called krien, (eye-catchers, or attention Figure 13. A susu mask of the gitvung type from the Ubersee Museum, Bremen, (photo courtesy of the Museum) July 1996 7</page><page sequence="8">getters). The fact that the Sulka could not identify the bird shape with any particular bird species was explained by some iiulka as kinmasqurr, an artistic tendency toward stylization and abstraction of form away from visual realism.1^ Another common type of early susu mask con sists of a sculpted lower cone that has distinctly anthropomorphic traits. In the Bremen Museum susu mask of this type (Fig.13) there is an addition al sculptural element, namely a large serpent form. The serpent head projects from the mouth of the fig ure and its tail curves upward rrom the back or the figure's head. The Sulka called this anthropomor phic form nunu. They also noted that the pierced septum and ears as well as the blackened teeth were associated with initiation practices. In form, this head is similar to the pair seen on the Hamburg hemlaut (Fig. 6), discussed earlier. The painted pat terns on the face and forehead of the figure and on the serpent's body are called eye-catchers. However, the patterns on the serpent's body may also be styl izations of actual serpent body markings. The ser pent form is commonly associated with dreams and Figure 14.

Some infor mants stated that when any of them has a dream in which a serpent spirit appears, that person is com pelled to fashion a beeswax model of what he saw in his dream, and then at some later date, to create a mask to represent this supernatural spirit. Ihese anthropomorphic susu masks are also frequently called gitvung susu. The word gitvung is used by the Sulka to refer to the young initiates during initia tion. Therefore, these anthropomorphic type masks might be associated with initiated status and entry into adulthood.17 An additional anthropomorphic susu mask type is found in several early collections (Fig. 14). In this type, found in both male and female versions, the sculpted pith cone is formed to create the torso and arms of a human figure. A carved and painted head is attached to the top. The upraised arms (with wooden hands) are found on both male and female versions of this susu type mask and are associated with dance ceremonies in which men and women carry plants in their upraised hands as a sign of offer ing and celebration. The carved wooden heads were also like another dance headdress that some Sulka associated with influence from the Patpatar-Tolai 8 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="9">speaking peoples of the eastern Gazelle Peninsula, the Duke of York Islands, and southern New Ireland.1^ Sulkanized Mengen suggested that simi lar masks had been made among their group in the past, thereby suggesting a sculptural tradition shared by them with the Sulka. In comparison to the small number of hemlaut masks made by the Sulka in recent years there are many types of susu masks being made for ceremo nial use. Figure 15 shows a pair of to-ka-ti susu masks (in full costume) standing outside a men's house (aggulu) at Kilalum village. They were created in 1982 by Paul Anis and are now in the National Museum and Art Gallery in Papua New Guinea. The multilayered leaf skirts and the upper band of white-colored large leaves are an integral part of the costume. Unlike most of the early susu masks in museum collections, these masks are made by wrap ping a large piece of bark into the lower cone shape, then wrapping twisted fern leaves to the upper cone (as in some early examples). This wrapped-bark style of creating the lower cone apparently originated in Figure 16. A pair of to-ka-ti type susu masks on display inside a men's house, Kilalum village. (Corbin negative #1983.2.8) the Sulkanized Mengen area sometime after World War One. It had already diffused to some Sulka areas by the time Bateson visited the area in 1928.I&lt;5 From the point of view of time it is faster and easier to ere ate the lower cone shape by wrapping a sheet of bark than it is to create the intricate and elaborate woven pith cone types seen on all the previously discussed hemlaut and susu types in earlier collections. The upper cone shapes have protruding upward curved forms (praga) and parrot feathers attached on top. The mask on the right is painted with a highly anthropomorphic face including eyes and mouth, while the mask on the left is comprised of more abstracted non-human-like designs. A close-up of these two masks (Fig.i6) clearly shows the human Matpil on the other. The matpil patterns on the right-hand mask have small eye forms set about mid-way on the cone. This pattern is often associ ated with commemorative posts carved for the mens house and for mortuary rites display. The woven,sculpted-pith shape between these two susu masks is a dance ornament carried by women in Sulka ceremonies. Another recent susu mask known as a kulkan susu was created by Paul Anis of Kilalum village for the 1982 ordination of a Sulka man named Joe Quintaip into the Franciscan priesthood.20 A photograph of a group of five of these susu masks (Fig. 17) dancing during the ceremony shows how the costumes sway about when the maskers are twisting and dancing. The woven-pith cone (called kamnikiet) on the lower part of the mask is surmounted by a geomet ric shape, which has four praga shapes sticking out ward from it at right angles. Parrot feathers decorate the tips of these extensions, while varied geometric patterns decorate the surfaces of the cones. According to Paul Anis, the geometric forms on top represent an ants' nest of a mud/clay type seen attached to trees and logs in the surrounding forest. These ants' nests are taken over shallow reefs and broken up so that the ants fall into the water and serve to attract fish, which are then netted and speared. Thus, the mask's identity can be associated with a form of food gathering, specifically an ancient Sulka method of fishing. On three of the costumes a broad tail-like shape can be seen with horizontal ly placed rows of broad leaves. This tail is called wur sien and is made of special aromatic leaves, which are thought to make women become attracted to the July 1996 9</page><page sequence="10">dancer wearing the mask.21 Similar leaves are fre quently hidden in men's carrying bags as a sexual lure to attract women. a raised bulge (purr) and there are brightly painted, eye-catcher patterns on the cone, bulge, and raised praga. The use of playing card motifs as sculptural shapes is rare among the Sulka. However, two dimensional patterns derived from playing cards are quite common. Many of the art forms discussed ear lier were made for the Catholic ordination ceremo ny and, therefore, used motifs associated with the church, such as crosses, stars, chalices, etc. Motifs associated with gambling would have been inap propriate for such an important religious event and are, therefore, totally absent from art forms made by the Sulka, Sulkanized Mengen, and Mengen for the ordination ceremony. Four of these spade-shaped susu masks are currently in the collection of the National Museum and Art Gallery in Papua New Guinea. An asymmetrically-shaped woven-pith susu mask (Fig.i8) that was made for the ordination cer emony by Wate of Guma village is also known as an ayokapun (taro root) susu. The long curved exten sion to one side represents a taro root that the bird (a carved and painted bird representing a parrot) is about to eat. The technique used to make this type of susu mask is similar to that employed in making many of the early anthropomorphic types, as already discussed.22 However, in this mask there is no attempt to create any anthropomorphic visual forms. Among the Sulkanized Mengen to the south, anthropomorphic susu masks surmounted by a bird have been made as recently as 1981 and 1982. AtTagul village these types are known as sisi rather than susu and the specific mask type is called Kot.23 Decorated Dance Wands (rei singular, orei plural) A recent innovative susu mask type, representing a spade shape from a deck of cards, can be seen in Figure 19. The mask was created by Kalvei of Kilvar, a village located in the hills behind Guma village. The praga shapes have been tied together on top to create an elegant spade-like shape around the cen tral woven pith cone. The lower edge of the cone has In many museum collections there are at least two distinct types of dance wands made and used by the Sulka before the First World War. Some of these wands terminate on the bottom in a cone shape, making them useful as headdresses as well as objects to carry in ceremonies associated with mourning the Figure 17.

The long dance wand on the left, called bal, was identified by Sulka informants as one used by men. The other two, with their smaller segmented shapes, were identified as wands used by women. These are called kapek. Within the elongated oval portion of these wands there is usually symmetrical patterning of a white figure set against a darker background. Interspersed throughout the darker ground is a medium color (light grey in the black-and-white photographs). The geometric zig-zag patterns in the two women's dance wands are said to be "eye-catch er" patterns to keep the viewer attending to the painted surfaces. The lower oval in the center dance wand contains an irregular form with two pointed sides said to represent the "eye" of the dance wand. Some of the irregular white shapes on all three wands are said to represent a sea bird (anandu) standing on the sand on the beach. This is most noticeable when Figure i8. An ayokapun susu mask with a bird form on top. Collected in 1982 from Kilalum village for the National Museum and Art Gallery, PNG. (Corbin negative #1983.16.4) the wands are viewed horizontally. The bill, neck, body, tail, and legs are merely suggested as a thin curved and pointed profile bird on the large mans dance wand on the left (top and bottom of the long oval) and in the lower oval of the dance wand in the center of the photograph. The other common hor izontal white shape was often identified as a cut vine called spang. Decorated dance wands terminating on the bot tom in carved anthropomorphic and zoomorphic shapes are also common in early collections. Male and female figures, praying-mantis-like insects, and wallaby-like mammals are all found as carved shapes on the bottom of some early dance wands.25 The Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin, dance wand in Figure zia and zib has a female human shape as the lower form. The female has both human and insec tile (praying-mantis) traits, although the human qualities predominate. Additional obvious zoomor phic characteristics are the sea-bird-like white shapes and a simple central "eye" form. Figure 19. A susu mask representing a spade shape from a deck of cards.

(Corbin negative #1983.33.34 &amp; .35) In recent years the Sulka, Tomuip, Sulkanized Mengen, and Mengen have all made both long (male) and short (female) dance wands. Many Sulka informants suggested that within these wands they create patterns that have been handed down from father to son over the years. They noticed that many of these handed-down patterns are similar to those seen on early-period dance wands. However, they are unsure of their meanings today. Many pieces cre ated for use at the 1982 ordination ceremony were of these types. In Figure 22 a large group of Sulkanized Mengen men are carrying long dance wands in a re-enactment of a spirit-catching cere mony. In traditional mourning contexts the Sulka used these long wands in a series of six dances (with accompanying songs) including an entrance dance (kavres), the first mourning dance (kamit), a criss crossing-in-pairs dance (papammum), an active run ning-back-and-forth-by-two-men dance (mokalu), followed by a purification dance (kangarup), and, 12 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="13">Figure 22.

Their wands are col orfully painted in red, white, yellow, and black with white feathers around the periphery and on top of the pointed end. There are also star-like shapes in the area between the long oval and the handle. These shapes and those articulated on the body of the wands are probably derived from various church related decorations such as crosses, stars, hearts, etc. Each woman is also decorated with shell necklaces and long colorful tanget leaves around her upper body and around her waist. Figure 24. Long dance wand (Sulka attribution) on display next to Sacred Heart of Jesus statue at Guma Mission (1983). (Corbin negative #1983.4.21) Another example of what appears to be a long Sulka dance wand (Fig.24) was on display in 1983 at Guma Mission next to a statue of Christ. This wand has a heart-like shape between the lower cone and the top. The long upper oval field is divided into three nearly equal zones each of which has painted stylized cross-like forms in white against a dark background. The cross motif is repeated as a small dark shape in the middle of the heart shape near the bottom. Architecture and Architectural Sculpture The circular Sulka men's house (aggulu) (Fig.25) photographed by Fulleborn during the Hamburg Südsee Expedition in 1909 has logs (kirkan, singu lar) placed horizontally on either side of the entrance and a cone-shaped roof topped by a smaller cone shape like that found on the to-ka-ti susu mask described earlier. Some Sulka noted the similarity of the roof shape(s) to the susu mask form and noted that they saw them as being similar to a woman's breast as well. This suggests that these simple cone shapes had at least two levels of meaning; a public one, such as a taro-tip, and a private (male) one, namely, a woman's breast. Sexual symbolism and male preoccupation with enticing women with hid den sexual lures and cosmetic practices were proba bly common among the Sulka before acculturation and mission influence. However, strong vestiges of these preoccupations seemed to exist even as recent ly as my field work in I983.27 Two types of carved architectural sculptures were made to be placed inside Sulka men's houses after mourning ceremonies. One of these was a large human-shaped commemorative post(s) known as mormingudor. These were made in both male and female forms representing ancestors, and were placed on either side of the inside entrance of the men's house. Figure 26 represents a male mormin gudor post photographed by Bateson in 1928 inside a men's house. Only the head and face were clearly sculpted as high-relief forms, while the rest of the body retained the original shape of the block and is painted with various patterns. Bateson also pho tographed a female mormingudor post (Fig.27), which was placed opposite the male figure seen in Figure 26. The female post has arms and breasts carved in low relief with one arm curving upward to 14 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="15">Figure 25.

A second type of interior commemorative post carving is known as matpil (Fig. 28) and, like the anthropomorphic posts, was made for a mortuary ceremony and then placed inside a men's house. Photographed by Bateson in 1928, the post illus trated here is covered with low-relief shapes outlined in white, red, and black. These patterns are said to represent the fat showing through a pig's skin as he was being cut up for ceremonial distribution.2^ Today, the shape and details of Sulka mens hous es are virtually identical to those seen by Bateson in the late 1920s. And, the Sulka still carve commem orative anthropomorphic (mormingudor) male and female ancestor posts, as well as decorated matpil posts. Figures 29 through 33a-d illustrate contem porary examples of a men's house with a carved head at its apex, male and female ancestor posts, and an example of a matpil post. The men's house in Figure 29 is located on the beach in a small hamlet set between Guma village and Guma Mission. A carved human head with a cap is set on top of the building. The head represents a high-ranking Sulka man wear ing a type of cap given to Sulka leaders as a badge of office by the German colonial government before World War One. In form, the circular-planned house is virtually identical to types seen during Bateson's 1928 field work as well as those in place around the turn of the century. Figures 30 and 31 are photographs of a female (matpil-to-arulom) and a male ( matpil-to-arokul) mormingudor post carved by Paul Anis of Kilalum village for use in the local village council house. An overhanging chin with low-relief facial and cranial features are found on both posts, as are low-relief lines that are cut into the bodies to represent sagging breasts (mem) on the female and decorative patterns depicting eyes and other eye-catching shapes. According to Paul Anis there is a certain sequence to carving a post of the anthropomorphic type. First, one selects a hard wood that resists insects (from kni tok or artlup trees), cuts it down, and brings it into the men's house where it is to be carved. Then, the artist strips off the bark (makem-ka-ptkiek) and lets the bare trunk dry out for at least a full day. The first stage of carving consists of laying out the various forms and patterns (kanvrick) on the surface with a piece of white chalk. Then, a thin incised line is cut along the chalk line to create the overall forms. The artist carves the head starting with the forehead (arplut), then the eyes (kalukiek), nose (warrgap), July 1996 15</page><page sequence="16">mouth (giu), chin (loknuk), and neck (ogurro). After the head is carved, the carver works downward from the shoulders to the lower base (kapun), articulating decorative patterns (kais), and the eye motif (kiek) along the way. Paul Anis' posts (Figs.30 and 31) are excellent examples of the survival of the earlier tradi tions until the present day. Unfortunately, only a few of the elder Sulka interviewed had ever carved anthro pomorphic sculpture of such a complex sort.2? A third example of an anthropomorphic post can be seen in Figure 32. The post carved by Joe Bois of Figure 26. Commemorative house post carving of a male ancestor inside a Sulka men's house (aggulu). A 1928 field photograph by Gregory Bateson.

N.B.215) Klampun village for the 1982 ordination ceremony in form is less ornate than those seen in Figures 30 and 31. The patterns incised and painted on the front of the post represent another variation of the cross motif, derived from religious paraphernalia seen at the Guma Mission. Matpil posts are still made among the Sulka. Several of them were made for the ordination cere mony in 1982.5° During my research among the Sulka in 1983, Chris Isaac and I commissioned a mat pil post by Paul Anis of Kilalum village for the Figure 27.

I photographed and documented the entire carving and painting process as it proceeded over a period of seven days. The completed post can be seen in four views in Figures 33a-d. Even though the post retains its orig inal tree-trunk-like form, Paul Anis has transformed the cylinder by a subtle combination of long incised vertical outlines filled with four separate design fields set between horizontal bands at the top and bottom. On two sides a clearly-articulated, carved, and painted matpil eye form is placed to help break the repetitive patterns. Five colors were employed on the post including black (kanain), red (svel), green (torn), yellow (yang), and white (kuvio). The m-like shapes painted along the vertical axis shown in Figure 33a represent the crest of a hornbill's beak (porgang-ka-rirr) repeated over and over again in ascending and descending patterns. The vertical pat tern seen in Figure 33b represents the flower (spang) of a vine from which fishing lines are derived. The row upon row of triangular patterns set into the ver tical format in Figure 33c represent a pattern known as lalgien, which was sometimes associated with snakes' teeth and/or the serrated patterns found on the skin of local snakes. Another more variegated use of triangular patterns can be seen on the fourth side (Fig-33d). These patterns represent the leaves (putt) of a vine that grows on and hangs down from trees in the forest. Carved Weapons of War Two types of carved and decorated weapons of war were commonly found among the Sulka around the turn of the century. These were war clubs (kierr) and shields (a gaile). Around 1903, in order to pacify long-standing warfare between the Sulka and the southern Baining (called Gaktei), the German colo nial government forced resettlement of the Sulka from the area of the northern Wide Bay. Along with this pacification came the "collection" of tradition al weapons by the colonial government. By the First World War most of the war shields had been sent off to ethnographic museums in Germany. The subse quent missionizing that took place also contributed to peace in the area, with the result that the need for functional war shields disappeared. Some smaller weapons, such as carved war clubs, were kept with in the villages as heirlooms when not employed for protection.31 Clubs The eight war clubs seen in Figure 34 were published by Parkinson in 1907. As of 1983, Paul Anis was one of the few elder men still capable of creating tradi tional war clubs. All eight clubs terminate at one end in a sharpened cone-like form. The opposite end of each club is carved into a different shape. Paul Anis identified these eight clubs (from left to right) as rek, krier, sal, vlomsei, karinring, karinring, gokon, and July 1996 17</page><page sequence="18">Figure 29. Overview of a mens house in a hamlet between Guma village and Guma Mission. Note the carved head on top. (Corbin negative #1983.3.35) mye. The long, bladed end of the rek club represents the inside part of a pit-pit plant. The krier club form has a nearly rounded shape near its end that repre sents a round stone used in warfare and thrown by slings. The third club, the ftî/form, was identified as sometimes having a sharpened edge for cutting the throats of one's enemies. The vlomsei club is said to represent the breasts of a young girl. The two kar inring clubs, with their irregular shapes, are associ ated with the pandanus nut. The gokon club, with its smallish serrated patterns, is said to be based upon the flower of a wild banana tree. The large pod shaped end of the mye club is said to represent the fruit from which seeds are taken for use as dance ornaments. Chris Isaac and I purchased the seven clubs pic tured in Figure 35 for the National Museum and Art Gallery of Papua New Guinea. These clubs were carved by Paul Anis of Kilalum village. The first and second from the left represent versions of the karin ring type, while the third and fourth appear to be variations on the mye type. The fifth club is obvi ously of the krier type with its clearly-articulated rounded stone shape. The sixth and seventh appear to be versions of the flat-bladed rek type, with the seventh having an eccentric shape not seen in early collections. Although the workmanship and ele gance is somewhat lacking in these contemporary clubs, there are still a few old men who are able to carry on their artistic traditions even though the need for the weapons had been lost long ago.^2 Spears and War Shields The 1908 photograph showing two Sulka holding spears and war shields (Fig.36) was taken by Vogel during the 1908-1910 Hamburg South Seas Expedition. The generic name for spear is mus, while the long type seen here are called avil. When the spear ends in a sharpened hornbill's beak it is called porge. The war shields are painted in motifs that are symmetrical from top to bottom. The face-like pat terns on the shield to the left were referred to as nunu, and were said to be protective in nature. The double-eye-like patterns on the war shield to the right were often called "tears of a snake" by the southern Sulkanized Mengen, and ralgien by the Sulka. Perhaps these designs are based upon patterns found on the back of some local variety of snake. In 18 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="19">Figure 30 (above left).

Commemorative house post carving of a male ancestor inside a Sulka community house. Made by Paul Anis of Kilalum village. (Corbin negative #1983.2.6) any case, all informants agreed that the patterns carved and painted on the front of the shields were protective in nature. The ρ re-World War One war shield (a gaile), from the Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin, illus trated in Figures 36a &amp; b, will serve as a type speci men for traditional Sulka war shields. The front (ktar) has a raised boss (kwie) near its center. Over this raised boss is wrapped a criss-cross of thin strips of cane (palvio). The fine woven wrapping around the outer edge (a qukaptak) served to visually create an outer border for the carved and painted patterns in the long oval of the shield, and it protects the edge against breakage during battle. The upper and lower repeated face-like pattern, nunu, is of the type that serves a protective function. The back (hevok) is carved and painted. A deeply cut handle (grom) is located directly behind the raised boss in front. The repeated two-eyed forms on the back may represent not only a nunu face, but the profile head of a local bird known as salmunu as well. This bird is said to cry aloud to alert Sulka warriors when an enemy is approaching their village. Two field photographs (Figs.38 and 39), which were taken in 1982 at Guma Mission during the ordi nation ceremony, will serve as a comparison between earlier Sulka war shields and those made today as Figure 32.

The first shows a group of Guma village men with four different dance shields. The one farthest to the left and third from the left are obviously similar in overall shape to traditional shields. The one on the far left also has a raised boss, although it has been carved with a Christian four sided star motif in its center. The double symmetri cal designs on the top and bottom are strongly sug gestive of earlier nunu. (face-like) motifs, although the face appears somewhat stylized and smiling. The third dance shield from the left has a symmetrical pattern above and below a squared-off raised central boss. However, these motifs are stylized Christian cross motifs. The second from left and far right shields are not Sulka-like in overall shape and are closer in form to traditional shields found among the Mengen people of Jacquinot Bay. The single dance shield seen in Figure 39 cleady makes use of Christian motifs including four-pointed stars at each end, large heart-shaped motifs on the upper and lower parts of the shield, and a six-pointed star (of Bethlehem) on the raised globular central boss. Conclusion The results of this study of continuity and change clearly show that the art of the Sulka is still extant in the early 1980s and that in the realm of masking there has been a strong adherence to traditional techniques and forms. New and innovative forms and decorative patterns reflecting influences from the Christian church are also evident in many con temporary Sulka arts. Less frequent is a viable carv ing tradition associated with weapons and warfare. This is due largely to the fact that active warfare has 20 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="21">been a thing of the past for at least 70 years. Sadly, only a few elder Sulka men are capable of creating their traditional arts, and only a handful of younger men have taken it upon themselves to learn how to create these remarkable art forms.

Lewis (1909-1913) was one of the early authors to differentiate between hemlaut, susu and gitvung types of Sulka masks. Bateson (1928) and Nevermann (1933) have written about the power of hemlaut and other masks as regards helping chil dren to grow strong if they are touched by the mask(s). For other works on various aspects of Sulka life, customs, religion, and language see Chowning (1976), Eichhorn (1916), Laufer (1952, 1955, 1962), Lewis (1934), Luschan (1900), Meier (1911, 1914), Muller (1915/16), Parkinson (1907), Powell (1883), Rascher (1903/04), Schmidt (1904), Schneider (1954), Speiser (1932), and Wurm Figure 36.

(1962), Bodrogi (1959), Corbin (1988), Fraser (1962), Linton and Wingert (1946), Schmitz (1969), Tischner (1954), and Wingert (1946,1953,1962). 6. Bateson did field work among the Uramot and Mali Baining in 1927-1928 and the Sulka and Sulkanized Mengen in 1928. His unpublished field notes were made available to me by Dr. Margaret Mead in 1974. Later Bateson met with me in New York and gave me permission to work with his Baining and Sulka notes and pho tographs in my own field work. When I returned to East New Britain in 1982-83 I used prints of unpublished field photographs from his 1927 1928 fieldwork to retrieve information from both Baining, Sulka, and Sulkanized Mengen infor mants. In August 1987 I presented a paper enti tled "Bateson revisited: an analysis and interpre tation of Baining and Sulka art in Gregory Bateson's unpublished 1927-1928 field pho tographs" at the Pacific Arts Association interna tional symposium in Honolulu. I am presently rewriting that paper for publication. 7. Frequently the image or pattern is highly stylized, making correct species identification difficult, if not impossible. 8. It is impossible to reconstruct the early clan own ership patterns as regards motifs and images. However, some clans in 1983 suggested that they had "copyright" to certain images. Today so few men know the techniques for making masks that this sort of knowledge seems to be freely shared. 9. These sorts of dance postures can be seen in many of A. B. Lewis' photographs of Sulka masks taken outside the Parkinson residence at Kuriendal before World War One. During the 1982 ordina tion ceremony at Guma Mission hemlaut masks performed in a similar manner, sometimes show ing the audience their painted patterns under neath the umbrella form. Paul Anis, an informant from Kilalum, was my primary source for this dance posture information. 10. Virtually all Sulka and Sulkanized men recog nized this double-headed hemlaut as lopela, sug gesting a widespread knowledge and distribution of this particular mask. 22 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="23">Figure 37. Front (37a) and back (37b) view of a Sulka war shield from the Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin. Collected before 1914. (Corbin negative #I982.32.I4&amp;I5). 11. Although this hemlaut mask with a serpent-like head is unique, susu masks are frequently made with serpent forms as an important iconic element. 12. Sulkanized Mengen associated this serpent-like hemlaut with a particular female cannibal spirit named Pagansae who lives in caves like snakes. 13. The French anthropologist Monique Ballini kindly sent me several field photographs of Sulka susu and hemlaut masks that she had seen dur ing her field stay in 1980-1981.1 showed some of them to Sulka informants in 1983 and collected some documentation about their meanings. 14. Susu masks of this type are common in German and Swiss collections and many date from before the First World War. 15. Today, a slightly larger, more bulbous type of susu mask, called lilwong,serves as a leader mask in cer emonies. 16. The Sulka do, however, have an awareness of real ism and refer to attempts to achieve true-to-life form as paniem. ιγ. Α. Β. Lewis (1909-1913) and Parkinson (1907) dis cuss the term gitvung and related words in refer ence to initiation and subsequent adult status. Bateson (1928) also observed initiations and asso ciated the word gitvung with these ceremonies and change in status from childhood to adult hood. 18. See Corbin 1990, Figure 6.14 for the female coun terpart of this male susu mask. The fact that Sulka informants used the word alorxa refer to the style of these heads further suggests a link with the Patpatar-Tolai area where both wooden and modeled skull masks are called alor and represent ancestor spirits. 19. In Bateson's unpublished notes (1928) there are frequent references to Mengen speakers living in Sulka villages and participating in various aspects of making and using masks in ceremonies. On several occasions when I was checking Bateson's Sulka vocabularies with contemporary Sulka speakers, I found that they do not recognize many words he collected as Sulka. This suggests July 1996 23</page><page sequence="24">Figure 38. A group of Sulka men from Guma village carrying decorated dance shields at the 1982 ordination ceremony at Guma Mission. Barry Craig photograph, (photo courtesy of the National Museum and Art Gallery, PNG) that Bateson may have sometimes unknowingly used Sulkanized Mengen informants who lived in Sulka villages. 20. Barry Craig, Rowena Hill, and Chris Isaac of the National Museum and Art Gallery were present at the ordination ceremony in 1982. In 1983 Chris and I followed up on Barry's and Rowena's accounts by showing photographs of various pieces they had collected and/or photographed to the Sulka to gather further documentation (see Craig 1982 and Hill 1982). 21. Rowena Hill's work among the Sulka on useful plants and artistic techniques is an extremely valuable area of research. Some of her findings are contained in her report (Hill 1982). 22. The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago has one of the largest collections of woven pith susu masks —second only to that of the Museum für Völkerkunde, Hamburg. 23. Anthropomorphic woven pith masks appear to be common today among the southern Sulka and Sulkanized Mengen, and less common among the northern Sulka villages. 24. When interviewing Sulka informants at Kilalum about the use of these dance wands in ceremonies it became clear after some time that there appeared to be a spirit-catching aspect to the cer emony. However, only when questioned directly about it did the older Sulka realize this function. Afterward, they all agreed that the spirit-catch ing aspect was indeed an important part of the whole ceremonial use of the long dance wands. See Corbin 1990:79 for a description of these dance wands in ceremonies. 25.The mantis form predominates, although I have seen a photograph of a well-formed rooster in the photograph archive at the Museum für Völkerkunde, Basel. 26. Corbin Sulka Field Diary Number 3, January 18, 1983, p.21. 27. Informants frequently referred to some sexual charm in the form of special leaves they carried 24 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="25">in their shoulder bags or pouches, or to the importance of teeth blackening as a sexual lure. 28.Bateson was fortunate to be able to photograph two matpil type interior posts and a male-and female pair (see 26 and 27 within this text and Fig. 6.28 in Corbin 1990). The pigskin motif is probably associated with the lavish feasts given during mortuary ceremonies. 29. Many of the elder Sulka were unable to create such complex art forms and were very concerned that the younger men had been leaving their vil lages for the larger cities and were unable to make traditional art forms. They feared that in a short while their artistic heritage might become lost if more young men did not learn about their tradi tional arts. To that end, on January 30, 1983, I gave the East Pomio District (based at Kilalum village) copies of 40 photographs of early period Sulka arts, including masks, headdresses, dance wands, clubs, and shields. This gift was intended to be used by the elder Sulka to educate their youth about their traditional arts in the future. 30.I was able to photograph the entire carving and painting process in the creation of the National Museum and Art Gallery matpil post discussed within this text (Figs.33a-d). 31. A reading of Sack and Clark's translation of the German colonial period reports (Sack and Clark 1979) clearly indicates the massive relocation pro ject, which moved large numbers of Sulka away from the border region with the south Baining to Mope on the St. Georges Canal, as a way of stem ming warfare. Along with this relocation came the confiscation of weapons, especially shields. In German Museums one can see dozens of Sulka war shields that were collected between 1900 and 1910. It does not surprise me that most adult men over the age of 60 had never made a war shield in their lifetime. Today, only a few Sulka are capa ble of carving a war shield. When they do make them they are usually made as dance shields. 32. Most older informants were unable to identify motifs carved on early period shields even though they were sure that their ancestors had made them. Their knowledge of masks was much better as most of them had made masks during their lifetime. Figure 39.
