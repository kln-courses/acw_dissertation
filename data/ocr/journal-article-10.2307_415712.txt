<plain_text><page sequence="1">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 63, NUMBER 2 (1987) computational techniques in a broad range of linguistic research. The first three chapters introduce computer-related terms and concepts, survey previous applications to linguistic and literary research, and describe some package programs for text research. The bulk of the book (Chaps. 4-14) is a relatively detailed presenta- tion of SNOBOL4, a programming language es- pecially designed for textual manipulation. For American readers, the major shortcoming of both books is the choice of programming lan- guages and computer-based statistical pack- ages. The two statistical packages discussed, SPSS and Minitab, are quite limited compared to other currently available packages. SPSS was replaced by SPSSX in 1983; the more recent package is considerably more powerful and eas- ier to use. Minitab is a useful package for teach- ing purposes but fairly restricted for serious research purposes. The most complete statis- tical package in current use, SAS, is not men- tioned in either book. Again, few institutions in the US have SNOBOL available on their com- puter systems, and those that do are unlikely to support it. B's presentation shows that SNOBOL has many useful features for linguis- tic analysis; however, a commonly available lan- guage like PASCAL would have been much more useful for an introductory text. The dis- cussion of computer-based statistical packages plays a minor role in Statistics in linguistics, and otherwise the book can be recommended as an introductory text. But Computers in linguistics, in which SNOBOL4 plays a central role, will be a less useful introduction. [DOUGLAS BIBER, USC.] Artificial intelligence: Bibliographic summaries of the select literature, I-II. Ed. by HENRY M. RYLKO. Lawrence, Kansas: The Report Store, 1985. Pp. 541, 574. $145, $180. Natural language is an important subfield of A[rtificial] I[ntelligence] concerned with the production and comprehension of language by computer. Linguists who have trouble finding employment in the traditional places are now entering the computer field by the score; and they are finding interesting, challenging prob- lems that allow them to use their linguistic train- ing productively. Computational linguistics, once outside the mainstream of linguistic stud- ies, is now a major artery in the body of linguistic scholarship. It therefore seems ap- propriate to review an AI bibliographical refer- ence work in a linguistics journal: many linguists will be interested in the numerous references to natural language, natural language processing, lexicography, computational linguistics, and even linguistics itself. Rylko's bibliographic summaries include technical reports, collections, proceedings, ref- erence works, books, and special issues of jour- nals. Each title contains a capsule review of the work, a complete table of contents, and other useful information. Each volume also contains a subject index, an author index, and an author/ title list ordered by author. Vol. I contains sum- maries of 210 titles, covering significant AI works through 1984. Vol. II reviews 237 titles from more recent research and technical pub- lications; it also includes an index of AI periodicals. Because the AI field is both diverse and dy- namic, it is important to ensure that the selected literature accurately represents the most signif- icant and fundamental work. R uses a special compilation process which involves the identi- fication of (a) the root disciplines of the field, (b) the publications of leading scholars in those disciplines, (c) the publications most often cited by those scholars, and (d) the publications said by those scholars to be important. An analysis is conducted to identify the materials that are considered most significant by these criteria. The summaries are not intended to be an ex- haustive listing of the literature; however, they reflect the work and judgment of acknowledged leaders in the field. The summaries contain an extensive coverage both of the basic literature and of more current work, and are an excellent starting point for the novice researcher and planner. In each volume, the entries are arranged alphabetically by primary author or series/proceedings title. A subject index is provided in the back of each volume. Vol. II also contains a 'Guide to the subject index', which lists very specific topics (e.g. 'Intentionality') and indicates the main en- tries under which they can be found (e.g. 'Nat- ural language' and 'Pragmatics'). One might wish that the volumes could mag- ically update themselves. The abundance of re- search that is continually being published in AI 456</page><page sequence="2">BOOK NOTICES will reduce their usefulness over time. Still, they will never be obsolete, because so many of the works referenced are part of the permanent literature. The text appears in a readable format that makes ample use of white space. Boldface, ital- ics, and capitals are used sensibly in a pleasant typeface; the quality of the paper and the bind- ing are quite good. Despite the price, the vol- umes are soft-bound. Our Vol. II arrived with pp. 541-56 missing. Linguistics is becoming an increasingly im- portant subfield within AI. The bibliographic summaries and cross-references are useful for pinpointing where the two fields come together. These summaries should also prove to be a val- uable reference aid to AI researchers in general, both in academia and in the commercial en- vironment. This well-organized, well-written work represents a prodigious and worthwhile effort. [ROBERT D. RODMAN &amp; DAVID KIRKS, North Carolina State University, Raleigh.] The meaning of primate signals. Edited by ROM HARRE &amp; VERNON REY- NOLDS. Cambridge: University Press; Paris: Editions de la Maison des Sciences de 1'Homme, 1984. Pp. xi, 257. Discussion of the communicative abilities of non-human primates runs from the nadir of R. L. Garner's The speech of monkeys (New York, 1892) to the zenith of D. L. Cheney's work on vervet monkeys (e.g. in Animal behavior, 1980 and 1982) and T. T. Struhsaker's (also on ver- vets in Social communication among primates, ed. by S. A. Altmann, 1967). On a contemporary level, I place the work of F. G. Patterson nearer the bottom, and this volume near the top. Growing out of a conference held in Bad Homburg in 1981, this volume contains 12 pa- pers-all interesting, though of varying quality. For linguists, the papers (and comments) in the section called 'Language and the description of communicating systems' (111-76) may well be the most interesting. I found particular value in E. ARDENER'S 'Ethology and language', and in the exchange between P. J. ASQUITH and R. HARRIS on anthropomorphism and use of the term metaphor. R. M. SEYFARTH'S paper on the meaning of primate signals to other primates and their meaning to humans is also of importance. The volume is well-printed and laid-out, with no obvious misprints. [PETER H.
