"Le XVIIe siecle n'est d6cid6ment pas ce que nous croyons," remarks Beaussant (295) after showing that, in all probability, in scene 6 of Le Mariage forcd Louis XIV danced mockingly around Sganarelle and was on stage when Sganarelle launched his "Elles sont gaillardes" at the men who danced the roles of the "quatre Egyp- tiennes." Hardly more unexpected is the fact that, in addition to more general works on the tragedie lyrique and the Paris Opera, three major books on Lully have appeared in the past twelve months-in addition to Beaussant's long-awaited work, Emmanuel Haymann's biography Lulli (Flammarion) appeared in late 1991 and Manuel Couvreur's Jean-Baptiste Lully, musique et dramaturgie au service du Prince (Vokaer) in late 1992. As the New York Times noted on Nov. 8, 1992 (H13), Lully and seventeenth century French music are "in" and have been since the Christie-Villkgier produc- tion of Atys in 1987. A private theater (Thiatre des Champs-Elysbes) sells out several performances of Alceste and Armide, displays in record stores are domi- nated by recent recordings by "baroquistes," and crowds flock to Tous les matins du monde to see two gamba players argue about the role of the musician in society. Beaussant makes a convincing case that Lully, this Italian who came to incarnate all that was French and create an art form that became the rage of the theater- going public in the 1670s-to the dismay of Racine, Boileau and La Fontaine-"est l'un des meilleurs t6moins du XVIIe siecle, de sa sensibilite, de ses goits, de ses mentalites, de son histoire" (12). The seventeenth century of Lully, however, includes Louis XIV "coiff6 de sa chouette avec au dos ses ailes de papillon" (93) (the King's costume in the Ballet de la Nuit of 1653) as well as in Rigaud's portrait. Such images (and they are not restricted to the early years of the reign) may indeed be unexpected, but if we take the time to look and listen, we will find a classical France in which the cultured classes spent more time polishing their dance steps than</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 377 their conversation, saw more performances by Lully than by Molibre or Racine, and took more pleasure in an ornate baroque set than in a bare palais a" volonth. Beaussant's book is written to be read "sans peine" (14), and though it contains numerous musical examples, one does not need any musical expertise to enjoy it. Beaussant, who is a novelist as well as Conseiller Artistique of the Centre de Musique Baroque de Versailles, writes well and paints a brilliant picture of the reign of Louis XIV up to Lully's death in 1687, with special attention to stage productions involving dance and/or music. He does reveal, however, a novelist's tendency to make generalizations without careful justification, and there are nu- merous errors of detail. To take two examples of particular interest to me, while Beaussant usually gives Lully's librettists the credit they are due in the success of the trag'die lyrique, it is exaggerated-and a bit anthropomorphic-to say that Quinault "n'a aucun genie pour caract&amp;riser un personnage : ses h6ros ont toujours ete falots, mievres par impossibilite de s'affirmer comme individu" (768). While the limited space of a libretto-and the esthetics of opera in general-usually called for characters de- picted in broad, general strokes, there are certainly exceptions such as Atys, Ceres, and Armide. It is also unfortunate that Beaussant perpetuates the myth that Quinault wrote his libretti with, according to Furetiere's Factums, "quatre ou cinq cent mots" (486). Beaussant counts 326 words in Armide, then explains more than 200 pages later that he only counted nouns and adjectives (692); in fact, there are 765 words if one counts all parts of speech. Enough quibbling; Beaussant's book contains a wealth of information and in- sights about numerous aspects of the seventeenth century. Of particular impor- tance to readers of French Review are the chapters on Molibre and the comidie-ballet (or "ballet meslk de comedie," as his contemporaries called Le Mariage force). Beaus- sant protests rightly against the tendency to downplay Moli"re's early connections with the courtly world of music and spectacle through his musician uncle Michel Mazuel, his tapissier father-who could have been called on to ornament the d6cor of a ballet, and his education at the Collkge de Clermont, where the Jesuits intro- duced ballet into their dramatic productions; perhaps Molibre had given consider- able thought to the combination of comedy, dance, and music before Les Fdcheux. Beaussant's combination of literary and musical expertise and, in particular, his knowledge of the ballet de cour which preceded the comedie-ballet and continued alongside it until 1670, help us see Moliere's collaboration with Lully in a new light. From the 170 pages devoted to this collaboration, including 40 on Psyche, I can only mention two brief examples. First, to critics such as Benichou who have found Georges Dandin immoral, Beaussant responds that the juxtaposition with the pas- toral that accompanied the play in the fites of 1668 shows "a quel point l'6goisme monomaniaque est la source principale du malheur des hommes" (360). Second, Beaussant's analysis of Les Amants magnifiques, especially when taken together with Apostolides's concept of "le roi machiniste" and the articles by Guicharnaud and Zanger, illuminates this crucial period in 1670-71 when the court becomes an observer at the royal spectacle rather than the symbolic expression of a baroque and neoplatonic world which is best revealed through dance (82). Beaussant's book is complemented in many areas by the articles in the Acts of the international colloquium on Lully held in Heidelberg and Saint-Germain-en- Laye in 1987. While some of these articles (in English, French, and German) are intended primarily for musicologists, several are of considerable importance for an understanding of the civilization of the reign of Louis XIV. For example, Howard presents an interesting look at the "positioning" of women in Quinault's libretti</page><page sequence="3">378 FRENCH REVIEW and on how these libretti reflect gender roles at court; one could argue, however, with some of her conclusions about this very complex problem. Kapp makes a convincing argument that the verses Benserade wrote to accompany court ballets are essential to a thorough understanding of the themes of mask, illusion, and sincerity that are so crucial to the "esthetique galante" of the years preceding full- blown classicism. Moliere is the subject of several important articles-musicologists seem more aware of his role in Lully's works than literary critics are of the other side of the coin. Auld studies the use of formal patterns to achieve comic effects in music and in comedy, using the opening scene of Le Bourgeois gentilhomme as an example. Betzwieser and Karro look at the Turkish influence on Moliere and on opera, and Fricke presents a valuable overview of the bibliography concerning the "symbiose artistique des deux Jean-Baptiste" (181) as well as an important example taken from Monsieur de Pourceaugnac. Let us hope, along with Fricke, that we will see more performances where equal attention is given to all the elements that make up a comedy-ballet, as well as more books that take into account more than one of the many facets that make up the rich fabric of the reign of Louis XIV.
