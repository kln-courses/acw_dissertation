Francis Bacon, "Of Marriage and Single Life"  The inmates of my cottage, all at rest,  Have left me to that solitude, which suits  Abstruser musings: save that at my side  My cradled infant slumbers peacefully.  My babe so beautiful! it thrills my heart  With tender gladness, thus to look at thee,  And think that thou shalt learn far other lore,  And in far other scenes!  Samuel Taylor Coleridge, "Frost at Midnight"  Berni Sinister was written five or six years after Nabokov's  immigration to the United States in 1940; it was published in 1947. In  the 1963 foreword, Nabokov notes that it was composed "at a partic­ ularly cloudless and vigorous period" of his life, yet he calls its main  characters his "whims and megrims" (BS, v, viii) . The reference to  "whims" should remind the reader of the deliberate overstatement  with which Emerson proclaimed his wish to write Whim "on the  lintels of the doorpost." • "Megrims" is an ironic understatement: the  time is winter and spring 1945-46; reports of the scale of recent di­ sasters are filtering across the Atlantic. "Much as one might want to  hide in one's little ivory tower," Nabokov will write to his sister in  June 1946, "there are things that torment too deeply, e. g. , the German  vilenesses, the burning of children in ovens,-children as funny and as  'Emerson, "Self-Reliance," in The Complete Works, 2:51 .   177  </page> <page sequence="2"> 1 78 Nabokov  strongly loved as our children"(PS, 41 ;  my translation} . 2  It is not surprising that the tormented Adam Krug takes a long time  to separate from the fictionalized extension of his creator. 3 The houses  that Krug sees through the hospital window in chapter 1 are those seen  through the window of the "novelist's" apartment in his dactylic  "comparative paradise" (BS, 241 )  of the last chapter: Krug's thoughts  about time in chapter 2 seem to be so close to "the novelist's" own  thoughts that by the middle of the chapter the novelist has to remind  the reader that the protagonist ("Krug-for it was still he-": BS, 1 3)  has already assumed a discrete identity of his own.  The world into which this Adam has been cast is a dystopia. Be­ cause of his wife's surgery and death, Krug has failed to notice the  frightening shape that the regime in his country has taken after a very  recent revolution. The power has been seized by Krug's former class­ mate Paduk, alias "the Toad" (the Shakespearean "paddock") . In their  schooldays Krug had bullied Paduk, sat on his face, or ignored him.  Now Paduk wishes to force Krug, a world famous philosopher, to  collaborate with the regime. He can no longer be ignored; he arrests  Krug's friends, surrounds him with spies, and finally tries to take  advantage ofKrug's love for his eight-year-old son David. Upon cap­ ture, the child is not held hostage in safety but sent, by mistake, to an  institution for juvenile delinquents, where he is murdered-a human  sacrifice in a grisly psychological experiment. Krug loses his sanity  and his life the day after he learns about his son's fate.  One of the rejected titles for Bentl Sinister was "A Person from  Porlock," a reference to Coleridge's famous story of having composed  a long poem in his sleep; on awakening the poet started transcribing it  on paper but was interrupted by a person on business from Porlock;  afterward, he found he had forgotten the rest of the poem, and so  "Kubla Khan" remained unfinished.  The intrusion of a person from Porlock is reenacted at the end of  Bentl Sinister. After a long period of grieving for his wife, Krug feels  a reawakening of inspiration. He bids his son goodnight in order to  pursue his "abstruser musings" but is interrupted by the lascivous  maid Mariette; the lovemaking is, in its turn, interrupted by the po- 2Nabokov's younger brother Sergei was killed in a Nazi camp.  3The subtle links between the text of Bend Sinister and Nabokov's biography (and  autobiography) are discussed, brilliantly if not always convincingly, in David I .

On a different level, howevei; the role of the person from Porlock is  played not by the intruding characters but by what Nabokov calls "an  anthropomorphic deity impersonated by me"(BS, xii) . It is the om­ nipotent novelist who, time and again, cancels the illusion of reality or  signals his own presence to Krug and the reader4; in the end he un­ ambiguously assumes the responsibility for the coup de grace madness of  the protagonist: "It was at that moment, just after Krug had fallen  through the bottom of a confused dream and sat up on the straw with  a gasp-a- nd just before his reality, his remembered hideous misfor­ tune could pounce upon him-it was then that I felt a pang of pity for  Adam and slid towards him along an inclined beam of pale light­ causing instantaneous madness, but at least saving him from the sense­ less agony of his logical fate"(BS, 23 3 ) .  The avatar of the person from  Porlock in Bend Sinister thus forestalls Krug's memories of what is, in  fact, Nabokov's own nightmare fantasy.  Why, then, did Nabokov reject a title so suitable as "A Person from  Porlock"? Perhaps because it would have deemphasized the novel's  concern with Krug's love for his son and wife and with the torment  that this love causes him (see BS, 1 87-88:  "what agony . . ." ) , espe­ cially when the attachment to the child proves to be the "handle" by  means of which Paduk can get hold of Krug: in addition to bearing the  heraldic meaning of "the wrong tum taken by life" (BS, vi) , "Bend  Sinister" also stands for the curvature of this handle-K- rug being not  only the Russian for "circle" but also the German for "pitcher ."s  On his way to an interview with Paduk, Krug is shown a room  where several physicians are listening to the beating of Paduk's heart  transmitted through the radio: "Thump-ah, thump-ah, thump-ah,  went the machine, and every now and then there was an additional  systole, causing a slight break in the rhythm" (BS, 142) . The scene is  a parodistic realization of the central metaphor of the novel, the beating  4The episodes in which Nabokov reminds us of the fictionality of the tale are dis­ cussed in e.g. ,  Richard F.

"The main  theme of Bend Sinister, " says Nabokov in the foreword, "is the beating  of Krug's loving heart, the torture an intense tenderness is subjected  to-a- nd it is for the sake of the pages about David and his father that  the book was written and should be read." Two other themes, he  continues, "accompany the main one: the theme of dim-brained bru­ tality which thwarts its own purpose by destroying the right child and  keeping the wrong one; and the theme of Krug's blessed madness  when he suddenly perceives the simple reality of things and knows but  cannot express in the words of his world that he and his son and his  wife and everybody else are merely my whims and megrims"{BS,  viii) . Though the development of these two themes occupies a much  larger textual surface space, it is the main theme-the agony ofKrug's  love for Olga and David, the ebb and flow of his emotions, the fluc­ tuations of his attention and intensity-that forms the organizing prin­ ciple of the novel and accounts for its peculiar tonal iridescence. The  two "accompanying themes" are subordinated to this central concern.  I  The main theme is seldom presented directly; its effect might  have been shattering for both the novelist and the reader. The "beating  of Krug's loving heart" is signaled at very frequent intervals, but it is  only in repeated reading that one can identify these signals and under­ stand their meaning.  The narrative abounds in metaphorical references to the somewhat  uneven systole-diastole rhythm of experience: the movement of a  nurse's face and her speech, inaudible to the grief-stricken Krug, are  described as "pulsation"(BS, 5) ;  trees are "pulsating rhythmically  with countless fireflies" in a remote jungle (BS, 79) ; "the individual  atom . . . p ulsates "(BS, 1 58); the hospital in which Olga died stands  beyond old tenement houses "unseen but throbbingly present"(BS,  1 89) ; "frames of reference pulsate with Fitz-Gerald contractions"(BS,  1 72) ; and among the "nocturnal sounds" of a great prison one can  distinguish "the heartbeats of younger men noiselessly digging an  underground passage to freedom and recapture"(BS, 233 ) .  Krug's  own heart "pounds" when he is frantically looking for David around  a provincial police station (BS, 103) and "thumps" when he is trying  to suppress his desire for Mariette (BS, 196) .  </page> <page sequence="5"> Bend Sinister 1 8 1   The changes in the texture of Bend Sinister parallel the systole­ diastole-pause rhythm. The narrative "pulsates" as passages conveying  or signaling Krug's emotions (systole) alternate with those recording  the thoughts or events that temporarily divert him (diastole) and those  supplying background information and thus effecting "camera­ stopping" breaks (pause) in the represented time. 6  One of the clearest examples of a violent systole is the description of  Krug's panic on losing sight of David near the police station:  "I want my little boy," said Krug (another Krug, horribly handicapped  by a spasm in the throat and a pounding heart) . . . . I  must not lose my  head, thought Adam the Ninth-for by now there were quite a number  of these serial Krugs: turning this way and that like the baffled buffeted  seeker in a game of blindman's buff: battering with imaginary fists a  cardboard police station to pulp; running through nightmare tunnels;  half-hiding together with Olga behind a tree to watch David warily  tiptoe around another; his whole body ready for a little shiver of glee;  searching an intricate dungeon where, somewhere, a shrieking child was  being tortured by experienced hands; hugging the boots of a uniformed  brute; strangling the brute amid a chaos of overturned furniture; finding  a small skeleton in a dark cellar.  At this point it may be mentioned that David wore on the fourth finger  of his left hand a child's enamelled ring. [BS, rn3-4]  The sequence of parallel constructions reenacts the stages of the spasm:  fright yields to violence, then to hope (at the thought of the happy  endings in games of hide-and-seek) , then to unmitigated horror. An  abyss opens in the last sentence of the passage, which is, ironically,  couched in dry academic language: it is left for the reader to imagine  what makes Krug recollect David's ring, another circle, "at this point."  Krug's unconventional acts, like his refusal to keep his dead wife's  comb and other mementos, show that his pain has not yet yielded to  what Emily Dickinson called "a formal feeling." Systoles are signaled  by his spasmodic weeping on the night of Olga's death and his out­ bursts of helpless violence on the night of David's ordeal. A systole is  also registered by a metaphoric allusion to Krug's "heart" following  6Robert Alter uses the "camera-stopping" metaphor to describe Fielding's technique  of freezing the action of a scene into a tableau and providing the narrative commentary  in lieu of a legend; see Fielding and the Nature of the Novel (Cambridge, Mass. ,  1968), p.  194. The space allotted to this commentary need not correspond to the represented time  that is supposed to elapse between the interruption and the resumption of the scene.  </page> <page sequence="6"> 1 82 Nabokov  the description of his bulky physical presence (pause) at Professor  Azureus's emergency meeting (diastole) :  Under this visible surface, a silk shirt enveloped his robust torso and tired  hips. . . . Under this was the warm white skin. Out of the dark an ant  trail, a narrow capillary caravan, went up the middle of his abdomen to  end at the brink of his navel; and a blacker and denser growth was  spread-eagled upon his chest.  Under this was a dead wife and a sleeping child. [BS, 47]  Among the devices that signal the systoles of the text are multilingual  word games. Russian words occur at moments replete with the most  intimate emotion. 7 Thus Krug explodes with "Stoy, chort [Stop, curse  you]" (BS, 1 7) when a farcical grocer's gyrations on the bridge remind  him of his child.  The multilingual games are frequently accompanied by paronomas­ tic translations that are probably best described as cases of "trala­ tition," which, according to an eccentric writer in Transparent Things,  is "a perfectly respectable synonym of the word 'metaphor ' " (TT,  69) . The play of the intellect that tralatitions represent enters into a  tug-of-war with the emotion whose presence they signal and whose  intensity they seek to reduce. They also compensate for catachretic  gaps: like the synaesthetic devices of Invitation to a Beheading, they are  among the means of "effing the ineffable." Frequently combined with  cross-referential recurrent imagery, they produce branching rhetorical  effects. For example, when Krug, in response to Maximov's warn­ ings, irresponsibly reduces political reality to word play, the word play  immediately conjures up another reality, that of his inner world: "Yer  un dah [stuff and nonsense]," he says. " [Paduk] will go on licking my  hand in the dark. I am invulnerable. Invulnerable-the rumbling sea  wave [volna] rolling the rabble of pebbles as it recedes. Nothing can  happen to Krug the Rock"(BS, 89) . The "average reality," the "here  and now" (hier und da in German) is "stuff and nonsense" (yerunda in  Russian) for the flippant Krug. Yet as the multilingual punning con­ tinues, the Russian ghost word volna ("wave") is heard in "in-vulne­ rable": a wave of Krug's emotion that belies his invulnerability is  ominously followed by the rolling "r" in the "rabble of pebbles" :  the  7Some aspects of the use of non-English words are discussed in Antonina Filonov  Gove, "Multilingualism and Ranges of Tone in Nabokov's Bend Sinister,"  Slavic Re­ view, 32 ( 1973), 79-90.  </page> <page sequence="7"> Bend Sinister 1 8 3   "grating roar" of Matthew Arnold's "Dover Beach." In the kind of  experiment in group dynamics during which David will be killed, the  torture starts with a pebble being spat into a child's credulously opened  mouth (see BS, 219) .   In  the capacity of defense mechanisms ("transfer" is another "re­ spectable synonym" for metaphor) ,  tralatitions are the only possible  way of describing Krug's reaction to the sight of his murdered child:  Tut pocherk zhizni stanovitsa kralne nerazborchivym [here the long hand of  life becomes extremely illegible). Ochevidtzy, sredi kotorykh byl i evo  vnutrennil sogliadatal [witnesses among whom was his own something or  other ("inner spy?" "private detective?" The sense is not at all clear)]  potom govorili [afterwards said] shto evo prishlos' sviazat' [that he had to be  tied] . Mezhdu tem [among the themes? (Perhaps: among the subjects of  his dreamlike state)] Kristalsen, nevozmutimo dymia sigarol [Crystalsen  calmly smoking his cigar], sobral ves' shtat v aktovom zale [called a meeting  of the whole staff in the assembly hall). [BS, 225)  The conglomerate of transliteration, translation, and tralatition is a  means of rendering "life out of focus"-but more about that later.  Soglyadatai ("inner spy," "private detective") alludes to Nabokov's  short novel The Eye (Soglyadatai) . The "eye" of that novel is akin to  the inner "double" of Krug, the observing part of the self that main­ tains a distance from the acting, feeling, and erring "I" and that  probably staves off Krug 's insanity.  Mezhdu tem is the Russian for "meanwhile." Yet the word tem, apart  from being the singular instrumental case of to ("that")-the meaning  in which it is used in the idiom above-is also the plural genitive of  tema ("theme") . The tralatition "between themes" echoes the recurrent  motifs of The Eye and Invitation to a Beheading. In The Eye the pro­ tagonist convinces himself that all the events of his life following what  he deems a successful suicide attempt are but dreamlike images evoked  by his fancy. In Invitation to a Beheading the author wishes to convince  the protagonist that all his oppressors are, in the language of Bend  Sinister, his "whims and megrims." The sense of unreality (the  "dreamlike state") is another defense mechanism that staves offKrug's  insanity until the morning in prison when insanity proves to be the  only possible defense against pain.  One should add that the name of the cool Crystalsen (Kristalsen in  the Russian transliteration) evokes associations with Kristallnacht, the  </page> <page sequence="8"> 1 84 Nabokov  pogrom of 193 8  that gave the first unambiguous signal for massive  persecution of the Jews in Nazi Germany.  Whereas tralatitions signal Krug's systoles and reduce their intensity  for both Krug and the reader, other devices register the pain against  which Krug has no ready defense. These are "semantic transparencies  yielding layers of receding or welling sense" (BS, x; my italics) : that  is, references to fleeting memories, conscious thoughts, and dream  images of Olga, unwittingly tactless references to her made by Beuret,  contact with or memory of objects associated with her. "Sense wells,"  for instance, when in Peter Quist's shop Krug notices a plate repre­ senting an ocellated hawk moth (see BS, 1 8 1 ) :  it is with such a moth  in her carefully cupped hands that Olga seems to have first appeared  to Krug, and it is in the shape of this moth that she knocks at "Nabo­ kov's" window on the last page of the novel.  In a first reading we cannot register the flow and ebb of Krug's  emotions precisely because it is impossible to recognize some of the  textual details as referring to Olga. fur example, when Krug accuses  police agents of having stolen Ember's porcelain owl, we do not know  that Olga bought this owl for Ember and, as it turns out later, never  gave it to him. Repeated reading also makes it clear that Krug's pain is  egotistic: it dulls his consciousness of Ember's plight. Ember is being  arrested and will probably suffer mistreatment as a result of Krug's  rudeness to the captors. One begins to understand the difference be­ tween Krug's imagining the word "loyalty" as "a golden fork lying in  the sun on a smooth spread of pale yellow silk" (BS, 87) and Maxi­ mov's less sophisticated but more upright rejection of any but the  dictionary meaning of this word.  Semantic trasparencies register rather than render moments of acute  pain. Less mediated expressions of emotion are cautiously infrequent  in Bend Sinister-and not only because "Nabokov" cannot "afford to  suffer" with his character. The evasion is a symptom of the skepticism  that Bend Sinister has carried over from "Ultima Thule": consciousness  is as mysterious as outer space and transcendent reality. Courting  recalcitrant inspiration, Krug wonders "what is more important to  solve: the 'outer' problem (space, time, matter, the unknown without)  or the 'inner' one (life, thought, love, the unknown within) or again  their point of contact (death)"; and the author seems to join him in  adding, self-referentially, "for we agree, do we not, that problems as  problems do exist even if the world be something made of nothing  within nothing made of something" (BS, 1 73-74) .  </page> <page sequence="9"> Bend Sinister 1 8 5   As Nabokov stated in "Anniversary Notes," Bend Sinister and Invi­ tation to a Beheading are "bookends" between which all his other novels  "tightly huddle"(SO, 287) . Invitation deals with the "outer" problem:  since human commitments fail Cincinnatus, he is free to pursue his  quest of "nameless existence, intangible substance" (IB, 26) , defy the  limitations of the material world into which he is cast, 8 and break  through the weary matter to the "unknown without." Bend Sinister  deals rather with the "inner problem," which is also, however, a prob­ lem of "nameless existence" :  both Nabokov and his "favorite charac­ ter" Krug (BS, 1 5 1) recognize the impossibility of tackling the  mystery of consciousness through ready-made lexical tools, and so  both content themselves with model approximations: "In this prelim­ inary report on infinite consciousness a certain scumbling of the es­ sential outline is unavoidable. We have to discuss sight without being  able to see. The knowledge we may acquire in the course of such a  discussion will necessarily stand in the same relation to the truth as the  black peacock spot produced intraoptically by pressure on the palpebra  does in regard to a garden path brindled with genuine sunlight" (BS,  192) . The theatrical framework over whose ruins the liberated prisoner  of Invitation to a Beheading steps on the way toward "beings akin to  him" (IB, 223) is an apt model for his gnostical monster world. No  such model is available for approximating the "inner" problem, the  problem of authentic feeling for another human being.  The narrative of Benti Sinister comes closest to the verbal expression  of the inexpressible when Krug is shown falling asleep in prison on the  day of his son's death. His love for David and an admixture of the  feeling of guilt are then rendered through the use of synaesthetic im­ agery and lyrical undulations:  All he felt was a slow sinking, a concentration of darkness and tender­ ness, a gradual growth of sweet warmth. His head and Olga's head, cheek  to cheek, two heads held together by a pair of small experimenting hands  which stretched up from a dim bed, were (or was-for the two heads  formed one) going down, down, down towards a third point, towards a  silently laughing face. There was a soft chuckle just as his and her lips  reached the child's cool brow and hot cheek, but the descent did not stop  there and Krug continued to sink into the heart-rending softness, into the  black dazzling depths of a belated but-never mind-eternal caress. [BS,  232]  8See also Hyman, "The Handle," pp. 63-64.  </page> <page sequence="10"> 1 86 Nabokov  The barriers of identity break down in death, and the infinite con­ sciousness is suffused with tenderness .  The passage transforms the  three balls of Krug's schooldays, the three shapes in the pattern of the  stone parapet, and the three birthmarks on David's face into three  heads9--Qf the child and of the parents-converging in love and death.  The pattern of three is thus one of the "semantic transparencies" that  signal the systoles of the text.  II  The relative inconspicuousness of the text's systoles in a first  reading is also the result of the novelist's use of perspective, particu­ larly the illusion of three-dimensionality, to monitor the attention of  the reader. Unlike the settings of Kafka's novels or that of Invitation to  a Beheading, the dystopic setting of Berni Sinister possesses spatial  depth, and its main characters are endowed with a strong physical  presence.  The latter effect is a response to a challenge: Nabokov was facing a  new audience and could not rely on characters who would be "trans­ parent to the eye · of the era" (KQK, viii) . 10 Invitation to a Beheading  emphasized the elusive, spiritual, transparent quality of Cincinnatus;  Berni Sinister, in which physical death plays a far more prominent part,  emphasizes the sense of the main characters' presence (or absence) in  the flesh, infusing their physical bulk with very physical, mortal, vul­ nerable tenderness .  Krug, Olga, David, and even Ember and Mariette  may still be Nabokov's "galley slaves" but unlike the characters of  Sebastian Knight they are no longer ephemeral "methods of composi­ tion."  Conversely, a method of composition is actually personified and  turned into a minor character, an obscure dissident student by the  name of Phokus: he is referred to twice (see BS, 95, 1 77) . In Russian,  focus has not only the familiar optical meaning but also the related  meaning of "magic trick," to which several of Nabokov's recurrent  9For a detailed analysis of these images and their significance, see Susan Fromberg  Schaeffe� "Bend Sinister and the Novelist as Anthropomorphic Deity," Centennial Re­ view, 17 ( 1973), 128-3 5 .

The prominent technique of Bend Sinister can be traced to the  snapshot-viewing episode in Mary: it consists of a selective focusing  (or phokusing) of the reader's attention. "Phokus" is a method of  putting things together (composing) in such a way to as to achieve  (an) aesthetic distance through remoteness in space.  The world of Bend Sinister is presented visually with the selective  focus of the camera eye. 1 1  The selectiveness produces an impression of  spatial depth; this becomes particularly obvious if one compares the  exhaustively described cell in Invitation to a Beheading with Ember's  bedroom, which is never described, in Bend Sinister. The workings of  Paduk's regime-exemplified in the behavior of the guards on the  bridge, the periodical arrivals of Linda Bachofen, the slips of Peter  Quist's tongue-burst into the foreground from the background of the  fictional world with growing frequency as the spiderweb closes in on  Krug. Presented scenically, these grotesque intrusions occupy much  more narrative space than Krug's feelings. The feelings, being authen­ tic, "real," defiant of verbal expression, are treated with wary indi­ rectness.  The philosopher Krug is much less capable of "multilevel thinking''  (G, 175) than the artist Godunov-Cherdyntsev. Like Pnin, he controls  his attention by channeling it to intellectual matters and disconnecting  it from the emotional substratum. The record of his experience, there­ fore, contains extensive passages of discourse that are free not only  from roller-coaster plunges into emotion but even from the more gen­ tle "semantic transparencies." In one of the most brilliant episodes of  the novel the narrator joins forces with Krug's friend Ember in helping  Krug "phokus" his attention away from his grie( This is the essence  of the Nabokovian variety of "foregrounding." 12  Whereas in Gogol  ' 'Discussing perspective in Bend Sinister in terms of the camera eye is particularly  appropriate because, like Laughter in the Dark, this novel is permeated with film im­ agery; see Beverly Gray Bienstock, "Focus Pocus: Film Imagery in Bend Sinister," in  Rivers and Nicol, Fifth Arc, pp. 125-38 .  On the relationship between cinema and  Nabokov's novels, see Appel, Nabokov's Dark Cinema.  12"Foregrounding" is the emphasis on the narrative itself rather than on the narrated  events. Western criticism has taken over this term from Ejkhenbaum's work on Gogol,  "Kak sdelana 'Shinel' ' Gogolia," and "llliuziya Skaza."  </page> <page sequence="12"> 1 88 Nabokov  the manner of presentation may compete with the content for the  reader's attention, here one component of the content (the play of the  intellect) is moved to the fore so that it might keep another (the po­ tentially devastating emotion) out of sight. Whatever gets said in the  episode is an alibi for not talking about Olga or dwelling on other  regions fraught with "emotional dangers" :   Krug will not speak of  her, will not even inquire about her ashes; and  Ember, who feels the shame of death too, does not know what to  say. . . . Krug, semi-intentionally, keeps out of reach. He is a difficult  person. Describe the bedroom. Allude to Ember's bright brown eyes.  Hot punch and a touch of fever. His strong shining blue-veined nose and  the bracelet on his hairy wrist. Say something. Ask about David. Relate  the horror of those rehearsals.  "David is also laid up with a cold [ist auk beterkeltet] but that is not why  we had to come back [zueruk] . What [shto bish] were you saying about  these rehearsals [repetitia ]?"  Ember gratefully adopts the subject selected. He might have asked:  "why then?" He will learn the reason a little later. Vaguely he perceives  emotional dangers in that dim region. So he prefers to talk shop. Last  chance of describing the bedroom.  Too late. Ember gushes. He exaggerates his own. gushing manner.  [BS, 1o6-7]  The tralatition repetitia (the Russian for "a rehearsal") is here used  for its connotation of "repeating." It foreshadows the repetition of the  arrests of Krug's friends .  Shto bish, an old-fashioned Russian familiar  way of inquiring about something that has been mentioned, sounds  like a tribute to the Maximovs, the most recognizably Russian of the  novel's characters, who have already been arrested and are to be shortly  followed by Ember and Hedron.  The bits of advice to "describe the bedroom," "allude to Ember's  bright brown eyes," and the like, stand for the narrator's self­ conscious search for ways to fill in pauses in the characters' conversa­ tion. The narrator likewise seems to be groping for an excuse not to  talk about the things that really matter. The sentences "Say something.  Ask about David. Relate the horror of those rehearsals" render the  thoughts of Ember, thoughts running in the same roundabout channel  as the narrator's own. Just as Krug points Ember in the safest direction  by asking about his Hamlet rehearsals, so Ember, by readily "gushing"  forth, seems to provide such a direction for the narrator. The narrator's  </page> <page sequence="13"> Bend Sinister 1 89  missing his "last chance to describe the bedroom" has a double effect:  on the one hand it divides (phokuses) the reader's attention between the  painful scene (the undercurrent of pain is conveyed through spasmod­ ically short sentences and "tralatitions") and the author's artistic  choices in rendering it; on the other hand, it suggests that the choices  are dictated by what takes place independently of the narratoi; in a  reality that has taken over and escaped control.  As if to relinquish his creative prerogative, the narrator bestows his  ingeniousness, wit, and intellectual brilliance on Ember, whose para­ Shakespearean exercise in the main part of the scene enters into com­ petition with the library chapter of Joyce's Ulysses and also in a sense  with its "Oxen-in-the-Sun" chaptei; in which a stylistic exercise oc­ cupies the representational time spanning a difficult childbirth. Em­ ber's language game, howevei; is completely free from the element of  callousness that Joyce's text neglects to avoid; it is played out of sym­ pathy, and its aim is to rechannel the flow of psychic energy that would  otherwise have fueled Krug's grief  Thus, the reason Krug's emotional fluctuations seem to occupy  comparatively little space in the narrative is that they mainly take place  not in the foreground but in the third dimension of the novel, along  the depth axis. The method of composition (Phokus) of Berni Sinister  offers marked contrast to that of Invitation to a Beheading, in which this  third dimension-unlike the metaphysical fourth one-does not exist.  As soon as the characters exit from the foreground of Invitation, they  cease to exist. One cannot imagine the presence of any parts of the  fictional world away from the limelight; there is nothing behind the  stage except, perhaps, the theatrical props. Cincinnatus is the subject  of experience rather than a fully realized character. Moreover, whereas  conventional novels about political prisoners usually create an almost  paranoid sense of conspiracy or of the impersonal workings of the  bureaucratic machine behind the hero's back, nothing of this kind goes  on behind the back of Cincinnatus. All the characters of whom Cin­ cinnatus inquires the date of his execution are strangely disconcerted;  not only do they have no answei; but the question itself is illegitimate  because, there being no fictional background, no action behind the  coulisses, the date of the execution is determined only by the involute  author and not by somebody within the fictional world.  In Invitation to a Beheading very few scenes imply more information  than they present. One that does so is the scene in which the prison  director follows the librarian out of the cell and returns carrying the  librarian's scarf and nursing a broken fingernail; M'sieur Pierre tact- </page> <page sequence="14"> 190 Nabokov  fully pretends that nothing has happened, and the reader is invited to  infer that the director has tortured the librarian behind the stage. This  is exactly the kind of thing that keeps happening in the world of Bend  Sinister, where bloodstained shoes or cuffiinks in the street are traces  of police brutality. Martin Edelweiss is never shot in the world of  Glory, and Cincinnatus C. is never beheaded in the world of Invitation  to a Beheading; the former novel cancels the character and the latter  cancels the setting just in time to sabotage the protagonist's "logical  fate"(BS, 23 3) .  By contrast, there is no doubt that David Krug is  tortured to death in the world of Bend Sinister-not in the foreground  but, mercifully, in the background of the action, between two para­ graphs or, to continue Nabokov's bilingual word play, "between  themes." Political prisoners are arrested, tortured, and killed outside  the range of the camera eye; spies hover on the fringes of the picture;  and Krug's heart contracts at the thought of his wife and son in the  emotional background of the text.  III  One of Nabokov's two "accompanying themes" in Bend Sin­ ister is that of the "dim-brained brutality which thwarts its own pur­ pose by destroying the right child and keeping the wrong one." What  is the relationship between this theme and the main theme of the novel?  The "dim-brained" inexperience of Paduk's regime-its trial-and­ error tactics-provides the interval of time necessary for a full display  of Krug's character, his grief, his recklessness, his concern for his child  and Coleridgean wish to see him in "far other scenes," his growing  uneasiness, the dormancy and the awakening of inspiration. In chapter  2, Krug is caught between the obtuse illiterate soldiers on one side of  the bridge and the cheerful para-academic lovers of bureaucracy on the  other side-the sluggish, potentially violent mouzhiks and sleek career­ ist Nazis? This is a mise-en-abtme episode: suspended between legal  brutality and its bungled implementation, Krug has ample time to  oscillate between emotion and intellect (grief for Olga and attempts to  cope with it) , never completely bridging the gap.  Krug represses his emotions by maintaining a Schopenhauerian split  between his active-feeling and passive-observing selves 1 J and by iden- 1 3See Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, 1 :85 .   </page> <page sequence="15"> Bend Sinister 1 91  tifying with the latter, the one (in the language of "Frost at Midnight")  that makes "a toy of thought" :   As usual he  discriminated between the throbbing one and the one that  looked on: looked on with concern, with sympathy, with a sigh, or with  bland surprise. This was the last stronghold of the dualism he abhorred.  The square root ofl is I. fuotnotes, forget-me-nots. The stranger quietly  watching the torrents of local grief from an abstract bank.

He has listened to me with raised eyebrows  when I said things which I had no business to say. In every mask I tried  on, there were slits for his eyes. Even at the very moment when I was  rocked by the convulsion men value most. My savior. My witness.  [BS, 7]  This division of personality (in a sense a model of the relationship  between Krug and his creator) temporarily allays Krug's heartache, yet  it ultimately turns out to be his hubris. Krug tragically fails to achieve  that unity of emotion and thought which Coleridge celebrates at the  end of "Frost at Midnight." Reenacting the pulsation of his heart, he  oscillates from the throbbing to the observing man and dissociates  himself from the one as he identifies with the other. This is the essence  of the dualism that he "abhors." His intellect is not attuned to his  emotions and fails to foresee a possible link between the child, the  object of his tenderness, and the web woven around him by Paduk. To  the reader, however, the link is made clear by the "tralatition" in  Paduk's speech, which Krug hears on the radio: "The most popular  photograph which appeared in all capitalist newspapers of that period  was a picture of two rare butterflies glittering vsemi tzvetami radugi  [with all the hues of the rainbow) . But not a word about the strike of  the textile workers!" (BS, 167) .  In Nabokov's work, especially in Lolita and The Gift, the motif of  the rainbow is associated with children and parent-child relationships.  Raduga moya ("my rainbow")-instead of the more common Russian  radost' moya) ("my joy")-are Krug's tender words of address to his  son. Krug fails to read Paduk's random dart as a danger signal, just as  in a later episode he does not see the meaning of David's stepping into  a puddle:  "Didn't you have any rubbers?"  "Uh-uh."  </page> <page sequence="16"> 192 Nabokov  "Then give me your hand. And if you walk into a puddle but  once . . ."   "And if I do it by chance [ nechaianno )?"  "I shall see to that. Come, raduga moya [my rainbow], give me your  hand and let us be moving."  "Billy brought a bone today. Gee whizz-some bone. I want to bring  one, too."  "Is it the dark Billy or the little fellow with the glasses?"  "The glasses. He said my mother was dead. Look, look, a woman  chimney sweep."  (These had recently appeared owing to some obscure shift or rift or sift  or drift in the economics of the State-and much to the delight of the  children. )  Krug was silent. David went on talking.  "That was your fault, not mine. My left shoe is full of water, Daddy!"   "Yes."  "My left shoe is full of water."  "Yes. I'm sorry. Let's walk a little faster. What did you answer?"  "When?"  "When Billy said that stupid thing about your mother." [BS, 16o-&lt;i1)   The image of a puddle, part of both a landscape and an acoustic  "inscape," occurs in the first sentence of the novel. The puddle looks  like "a fancy footprint filled to the brim with quicksilver; like a spat­ ulate hole through which you can see the nether sky"(BS, 1 ) .  The  "nether sky" is both the reflection of the sky in Cambridge,  Massachusetts-the "comparative paradise" where the novel is being  written-and the sky of the nether world into which Krug is about to  be cast. '4 In the last paragraph of the novel, after the nether (never?)  world has been canceled, "Nabokov" catches one more glimpse of this  puddle, "the one Krug had somehow perceived through the layer of  his own life" (BS, 241 ) .  The puddle is thus a kind of gateway from  Krug's world to that of the novelist. Therefore, David's stepping into  the puddle foreshadows his death (his passage to another world?) at the  end of the novel. 1 s  Significantly, it is Krug himself who, having lost his equanimity on  hearing the allusion to Olga's death, leads David into a puddle. "That  was your fault, not mine," says the boy: like most of Nabokov's  '4More about the "nether sky" in Toker; "Between Allusion and Coincidence,"  1 84-86.

Indeed, at a crucial  moment Krug is unable to reason with the people who come to arrest  him. His violently emotional active self takes over; the controlling  observing self is suppressed; and his irrational behavior largely leads to  the "mistake" that his captors make with David. David himself, on the  other hand, is heard "trying to reason with his impossible visitors"  (BS, 201 ) .  Krug fails to follow his example, just as he has failed to  perceive the ominous significance in the cryptographic recurrences of  the pattern of three, of the shoe-shaped puddles, of stains that imitate  the form of Lake Malheur, and other danger signals sent him by the  "anthropomorphic deity" impersonated by "Nabokov." 16  More surprisingly, for a long time Krug takes no heed of Maxi­ mov's warnings, of his friends' arrests, of the badly trained spies  around him, of Mariette's phone calls, and the oddities in the behavior  of Peter Quist (who blushes on realizing that David is the handle by  which the regime can get hold of Krug) . The episodes that thus de­ scribe the workings of Paduk's regime effect the "diastoles" of the  text: Krug is unable to see the connection between the sinister bend of  politics and his private world, his "mirok"11 (BS, 8) ; therefore the  encounters with Paduk and his agents divert him not only from his  inner life, "turn[ing] the torrent away"(BS, 1 1 ) ,  but also from the  possibility of having to concede his child to the threatening larger  world, the circle (krug) without a circle. Krug has not found a working  solution for the "inner problem." Incidentally, under no circumstances  is it a good idea to make a habit of sitting on anybody's face during or  after one's schooldays.  The obtuseness of the regime is not an arbitrary means of retarding  the climax of Krug's tragedy of errors. In Paduk's "Ekwilist" society  a "little human creature" is "of no value to the community" (BS, 2 1 8) ;   no one is irreplaceable; and the citizens are promised that their  "groping individualities will become interchangeable and, instead of  crouching in the prison cell on an illegal ego, the naked soul will be in  16See also Shaeffer, "Bend Sinister and the Novelist as Anthropomorphic Deity,"  pp. 1 28-35 .   '7Mirok, the tralatition for  which is "[small pink potato)," is the diminutive of  the  Russian mir-"world." Asking a salesman for a soccer ball, Pnin describes with his  hand a "portable world" (P, 99); proportionately, a little world, mirok, would assume  the dimensions of a potato.  </page> <page sequence="18"> 194 Nabokov  contact with that of every other man in this land" (BS, 97) . It is quite  natural, therefore, that the ideologist of practical Ekwilism should for  a long time fail to realize the force of Krug's love for a "disposable"  little human creature.  It is not for a police state to understand the agony of the physical  blended with the spiritual in a father's love for a child. Discrete phys­ ical life is a "prism or prison" of finite consciousness (BS, 17 1 )  in  which "infinite consciousness"-call it Shelley's "white radiance of  eternity"-is refracted into a breathtaking rainbow. In this great  prison of physical life "younger men [are] noiselessly digging an un­ derground passage to freedom and recapture"(BS, 23 3 ) .  So long as  physical life continues, moments of transcendent freedom will be fol­ lowed by recapture. Only death is the final escape into infinite con­ sciousness, the perfect knowledge, the fulfillment of "the attempt of a  point in space and time to identify itself with every other point" (BS,  175) .  This is a much more pleasing variant of death than that other  hypothesis, the "absolute nothingness, nichto" (BS, 1 75) ;  all the same,  as in Shakespeare's famous sonnet, to die is to leave one's love alone.  Whereas in Nabokov's novels sexual love (especially the magical state  of "being in love") opens a door to transcendent reality, tenderness  (especially that of parental love) promotes the acceptance of the prison  of so-called material reality and fosters the love of this rainbow world  despite its "endless waves of pain" (ND, 67) .  It is noteworthy that Nabokov did not manage to dam the waves of  pain by writing Bend Sinister; they spill into "Signs and Symbols,"  written within a year after the publication of this novel. Like Berni  Sinister, "Signs and Symbols" is devoted to "the incalculable amount  of tenderness contained in the world" and to "the fate of this tender­ ness, which is either crushed, or wasted, or transformed into mad­ ness" (ND, 67) .  The somewhat Kafkaesque, outre treatment of the sinister regime  that exposes tenderness to torture is deliberately nonrealistic in Bend  Sinister. The mechanical absentminded predictability of the conduct of  its servants is used for comic relief: following, as it were, Bergson's  prescriptions for the creation of the laughable18 because the humor  could not be spontaneous. As noted above, Nabokov does not have to  invent a dystopia; others have done it, with different degrees of suc­ cess, before him. His Padugrad is economically built of narrative de- '8See Bergson, "Laughter," pp. I I?-43 ·  </page> <page sequence="19"> Bend Sinister 195   tails whose amount barely suffices to give "Nabokov" something to  destroy by canceling the dramatic illusion in the last pages of the book:  "He saw the Toad crouching at the foot of the wall, shaking, dissolv­ ing, speeding up his shrill incantations, protecting his dimming face  with his transparent arm, and Krug ran towards him, and just a frac­ tion of an instant before another and better bullet hit him, he shouted  again: You, you-and the wall vanished, like a rapidly withdrawn  slide, and I stretched myself and got up from among the chaos of  written and rewritten pages, to investigate the sudden twang that  something had made in striking the wire netting of my window"  (BS, 240) .  This involute cleanup (the "epilogical mopping up":  A, 528) is pos­ sible only if there exists some dystopia, at least a "hastily assembled"  one (IB, 5 1) ,  to remove. The theme of the totalitarian regime is thus  subservient not only to the main theme of the novel but also to the  second "accompanying" theme: "Krug's blessed madness," during  which-like the hero of Borges's "Circular Ruins"-Krug under­ stands that he is an invention of someone else.  IV  Just as the accounts of Paduk and his regime (the first accom­ panying theme) do not form a political allegory as such, so the account  of Krug's madness and return to the bosom of the "anthropomorphic  deity impersonated by" his maker (the second accompanying theme)  does not form a full-fledged cosmogonal allegory. Krug's madness and  the "mopping up" associated with it belong to the complex of self­ referential devices scattered throughout the novel. •9 These devices re­ mind the reader of the fictionality of the tale and function as the kind  of reassurance that we offer frightened children ("There, there, this is  only a story") . Yet such reassurance is not unreserved: Nabokov insists  that his story is essentially true. Even after canceling the dramatic  illusion by suggesting variants of Krug's interview with Paduk, he  makes a "definitive" statement: "Did Krug really glance at the pre­ pared speech? And ifhe did, was it really as silly as that? He did; it was.  '9The self-referential aspect of Bentl Sinister is exhaustively discussed in Johnson,  Worlds in Regression, pp. 187-205; Patteson, "Nabokov's Bentl Sinister"; and Schaeffer,  "Bentl Sinister and the Novelist as Anthropomorphic Deity."  </page> <page sequence="20"> 196 Nabokov  The seedy tyrant or the president of the State, or the dictator, or  whoever he was-the man Paduk in a word, the Toad in another-did  hand my favorite character a mysterious batch of neatly typed pages"  (BS, 1 5 1 ) .  The sentence must be read figuratively: we all know how  tyrants in this or "forking" worlds (Marianne Moore's "real toads" in  real or imaginary gardens) demand that the great minds and talents of  the age surrender their intellectual integrity. One may wonder which  historical personages, between the collaborating Heidegger and the  defiant Gumilyov, were in the back of Nabokov's mind during his  work on Bend Sinister. Nor are hostage situations like David's an in­ vention of Nabokov. The experience of which Krug is an exponent  represents both Hawthorne's "truth of the human heart" and the his­ torical truth; only its outer trappings are fictional, changeable,  disposable-a- nd disposed of by the dense self-referentiality of the text.  It is not only that Nabokov, like Ember during Krug's visit, chooses  to "talk shop" in order to rechannel part of the reader's attention from  shared pain to the writer's craft. His cavalier dismantling of the fic­ tional world cancels not just the setting but also the plot, including,  among other things, what seems to have been Krug's major mistake.  The novel discourages such reflections as "If only Krug had done this  or that, David would have been saved, and everything would have been  fine, you see." When Krug is ready to take Paduk's dictation in order  to get his son back, the guards produce "the wrong child," Arvid  Krug, whom they have obviously been mistreating. This boy, to  quote Nabokov's letter to his sister, is perhaps ·�ust as funny and as  strongly loved" as David: whatever Krug does or does not do, one of  these two children (and there have been at least two million of them)  will suffer a terrible fate. There are no solutions to Krug's predicament  within his own world; "Nabokov," at least, knows better than to offer  one. Among the sound that Krug hears in his giant prison there is "the  cautious crackling of a page which had been viciously crumpled and  thrown into the wastebasket and was making a pitiful effort to un­ crumple itself and live just a little longer"(BS, 23 3-34) . This may be  the sheet of paper on which "Nabokov," in the "comparative paradise"  of his workshop, wrote a provisional plot solution (different from that  of the fair copy) and, feeling it inadequacy, "viciously crumpled" it  and threw it out. There are no solutions-even Adam Krug's timely  choice of death would not have saved either David or Arvid Krug-in  the world where even a discarded sheet of paper wishes to "live just a  little longer."  </page> <page sequence="21"> Bend Sinister 197  Tragic or near-tragic novels often create extreme situations in which  ultimate questions can receive no solutions. One could say that in Bend  Sinister Nabokov provides no solution (short of the wish-fulfilling  cancellation of the dystopia) , because the extreme situation that he has  created admits of none. Yet it seems that he has created the extreme  situation precisely for the purpose of denying his novel the right to  propose a definite moral or political solution. In life, by contrast to  tragic fiction, partial solutions are welcome: the bombing of  Auschwitz would have helped and individual acts of heroism did help  to save individual universes before the major dystopia of the present  century was canceled by the allied armies. Bend Sinister is not a pro­ pagandistic call for action. It is a muted call for attention and empathy.  In an imaginary dystopia it seeks out the real vulnerable tenderness  that has always been caught and harassed between recurrent epidemics  of brutality and never ending, beautifully sterile abstruse research.  </page> </plain_text>
