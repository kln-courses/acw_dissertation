For it has never been a Society devoted to the study of Aristotle. Always it has been a neutral arena in which leading representatives of the major tendencies of British thought have met and done their jousting. The present Index covers the Society's Proceedings for the fifty years from 1900 to 1949 (inclusive), and is unique in being virtually a collective effort by the many philosophers who have co-operated in its production by preparing synopses of their papers. It is on the following general plan: PART I In this Part there appear, in alphabetical order, the names of all the contributors of papers throughout the 1900-1949 period. Directly under each name of a contributor will be seen the titles of all his contributions arranged in the order of their delivery. Immediately under the title of a paper there appears (not in all cases, but in the case of all the more recent contributors) a 'synopsis of the argument'. Almost without exception, the authors themselves have co-operated in preparing these synopses, some simply authoriz- ing the Editor's version, others amending before adopting, and many (among them such representative names as the late John Laird, C. D. Broad, G. C. Field, William Kneale, G. E. Moore, H. H. Price, Gilbert Ryle, John Wisdom) doing the whole of the work.' PART II Part II is a brief Index of Subjects. In this Part the references given under any 'subject' are always references back to Part I. The reader, on turning back to the proper place in Part I, finds immediately which volume of the Proceedings to consult, and at what pages. 1 Synopses for which the Editor alone is responsible (chiefly those of papers whose authors were no longer living at the time when the work was commenced) are marked by an asterisk. vii</page><page sequence="5">vifi PREFACE The Subject-Index is complete for all titles to papers (printed in italics). Additional entries ('Points') are inserted merely for their interest. They are not exhaustive, or in any order of importance. The Appendix is self-explanatory and will, I hope, have its usefulness. After the contributors themselves, whose names appear throughout the volume, the Editor's greatest debt is to the guarantors. The Glasgow University Press, the Aristotelian Society, the Jowett Copyright Fund and the American Philosophical Association have between them underwritten the venture to the extent of nearly ?600. Thanks are also due to the publishing house of Blackwell, Oxford, for the competence and the interest they have shown in the whole undertaking. Lastly I must mention that while I have been myself responsible for the main bulk of the 'editorial' work, I have had the great advantage of being able to leave the 'production' (if one may use the convenient radio term) of the volume in the hands of my ex-student and colleague, Mr. William Haas. Without his sagacity and philosophical acumen, to say nothing of patient, con- tinuous and ungrudging co-operation over many years, publication would not have been possible.</page><page sequence="6">PART I SYNOPSES</page><page sequence="7">AARON, R. I. 1 Locke's theory of universals, Vol. XXXIII (1932-33), pp. 173-202 Synopsis: A Berkeley's misinterpretation of Locke's theory of universals 173-6 B Locke and representative perception, 177-80 C Idea. Meaning of the term in Locke's work, 181-2 D The Universal as a particular idea representing other particular ideas, 182-6 E The universal as an abstraction through elimination, 186-8 F The universal as the precise meaning, 188-90 G Universals of natural science, 190-4 H Universals in mathematics, 194-6 I The relations between general knowledge and empirical know- ledge, 196-202 2 Is there an element of immediacy in knowledge? Symposium, Suppl. XIII (1934), pp. 203-17 Synopsis: A What sort of immediacy? And in what sort of knowledge? 203-4 B Direct knowing. If immediacy means intuition, all direct knowing consists of it, 204-5 C Idealist logic. Mr. C. R. Morris and the idealist logician's denial of immediate know- ledge, 205-7 D Knowing and thinking. Isn't it only from thinking that the idealist must exclude the immediacy? 207-8 E Why we identify the two so readily, 208-9 F Idealism. The idealist logician takes both of these as 'inference', and inference as the 'ideal self-development of an object'; thus (illegitimately) trying to 'get into' the implication, rather than take it as something intuitively known, or 'seen', 209-11 G The external world. Where, in our knowledge of the external world, does that 'direct knowing' come in, which furnishes the element of immediacy in knowledge? 211-14 H A place for it could be found in the knowledge of the existence of physical objects, if we could be quite certain that we had such knowledge, 214-15 I Mathematics. Here, surely (in mathematics) there is an element of immediacy; and in our knowledge of implication, 215-16 J Moreover, those need not be mind-dependent, 216 K Residual problems, 216-17 3 How may phenomenalism be refuted? Vol. XXXIX (1938-39), pp. 167-84 Synopsis: A Contemporary phenomenalism, 167-9 B Professor G. F. Stout's criticism of phenomenalism, 169-75 C Does critical realism refute phenomenalism? 175-9 D The material-object proposition cannot be translated into sense-data propositions, 179-83 E Are phenomenalism and critical realism the only alternatives? 183-4 4 Hume's theory of universals, Vol. XLII (1941-42), pp. 117-40 Synopsis: A Three elements in Hume's theory of universals, 117 B Hume's account of resemblance, 117-22 C The universal is individual but 'general in representation', 122-6 D The significance of Hume's analogies, 126-9 E The 'propensity,' or 'dispositional' theory of universals, 129-31 F Its modern counterparts, 131-4 G Is Hume a realist or a nominalist? 134-7 H Relations between Hume's theory of universals and Locke's theory, 137-40 5 The causal argument for physical objects, Symposium, Suppl. XIX (1945), pp. 57-76 Synopsis: A Not even the philosopher really doubts that the table exists, but for various reasons the philosopher feels he ought to be doubting, 57-8 B Consideration of these reasons. Why they do not in fact shake our conviction, 59-63 C The argument from successful prediction re-stated, 63-5 D Its failure to justify, or even to strengthen the case for, the realist view as to the existence of physical objects, 65-7 E Does the argument from successful prediction help us to determine what the physical object is, supposing that it does exist? 67 F Not in respect to the colour, 67-70 G Nor in respect to structure, 70-72 H But we do know much as to what the physical object is, and we know it with certainty; although never the whole structure, 73 X The argument from successful prediction in its real application, as confirming our hypotheses and assump- tions, as to the nature of that part of the structure which is not known directly, 73-4 J Can the physical object be identified with a group of unsensed sensa? No, if only because the apparent causal activity of physical objects cannot then be explained, 74-5 K We do not know introspecta but a mind; also, we do not know sensibilia but a physical body, 75-6. ACTON, H. B. 1 Phenomenology, Symposium, Suppl. XI (1932), pp. 101-15 Synopsis: A Husserl's theory of a phenomenological reduction which reveals transcendental selves, 101-2 B According to Husserl the immanent perceptions of transcendental selves are indubitable, 102-4 C According to him the natural world is relative to 03</page><page sequence="8">ACTON Acton, H. B.-continued transcendental selves, 104-5 D Descriptive psychology is criticized, 105-7 E Trans- cendental selves are for Husserl concrete entities, 107-8 F And phenomenology is a descriptive science more fundamental than logic and mathematics, 108-10 G Husserl's idealism differs from that of Dilthey, 110-11 H Criticisms. His argument for the necessity of a transcendental reduction is circular, 112-13 I His assumption of a plurality of transcendental selves involves inconsistencies, 113-14 J He appears to make truth dependent on transcendental selves, 114-15 K His doctrine of transcendental selves consistent with geology and evolutionary biology, since these sciences contain no proposi- tions about transcendental selves, 115 2 The correspondence theory of truth, Vol. XXXV (1934-35), pp. 177-94 Synopsis: A Some objections to the theory (e.g., that it requires a mental complex to have the identical structure which a non-mental one has). 177-81 B Differences between correspondence and copying, 181-2 C Correspondence and concordance, 182-3 D Some pre-requisites of the correspondence theory, viz., that there is acquaintance, that there are facts, that there are ultimate elements of fact, etc., 183-7 E Statement of the correspondence theory in terms of a correspondence between symbols and facts, 187-8 F Difficulties in the correspondence theory (hypothetical or disjunctive 'facts', the difficulty of seeing how ordinary language can have the same structure as the facts it corresponds to), 188-93 G The theory of truth and arguments against its possibility, 193-4 3 Is ethical relativity necessary? Symposium, Suppl. XVII (1938), pp. 170-82 Synopsis: A Two types of argument for ethical relativism: (i) the argument from differences between codes, 171-3 B (ii) The argument that the making of a moral judgment is the assumption of an attitude, 173-5 C Ethical objectivism. The central issue the possibility of moral knowledge. Rightness cannot be observed as a characteristic of a particular action, 175-9 D Conscience. The appeal to it presupposes a form of ethical relativism, rather than disposes of it, 179-81 E Reason the moral faculty? This is not a very helpful question but, at all events, only thinking beings could distinguish right actions from wrong, 181-2 4 The philosophy of history, Vol. XL (1939-40), pp. 75-88 Synopsis: A The nature of historical knowledge a proper object of philosophical inquiry, 75-6 B Types of 'philosophies of history' (i) Religious and metaphysical, 76-7 C (ii) Sociological, 77-9 D (iii) Epistemological, which raise the problem: What is a historical event? 79-82 E What, among first order events, are 'important' (such an event being understood as an occurrence 'at the human level of discourse')? The objective answer, 82-5 F Meaning of bias in history, 85-6 G Organizing conceptions with which historians operate, 86-7 H Ethical neutrality, its meanings and possibility, 87-8 AINSLEE, D. 1 Benedetto Croce's 'Historiography', Vol. XIII (1921-22), pp. 205-14 ALEXANDER, S.* 5 The nature of mental activity, Symposium, Vol. VIII (1907-08), pp. 215-26; 249-55 Synopsis: A The topic to be discussed; namely the nature of general mental activity, 215 B But first, the mentally active state-in the narrower sense in which it is contrasted with a passive. Its description, 216-19 C Activity in the wider or general sense best termed 'movement'. This, while being how I am aware of such activity, is also how it is physiologically; e.g., in my brain-movements. Such 'movement', with its varying direction (and varying degree of rapidity) as its sole differentiations, is itself consciousness. And nothing which is object to it-e.g. qualities or sensations-is differentiation of it, 219-22 D It follows that consciousness is essentially conative, and that to be conscious is to be already self-conscious, 222-3 E Consciousness is simply a quality found in certain organisms, 224-5 F The illegitimacy of such expressions as 'consciousness of con- sciousness', or 'attending to my attention', 225-6 G Reply to sundry objections urged by Professor Ward, 248-55 6 Mental activity in willing and in ideas, Vol. IX (1908-09), pp. 1-40 Synopsis: A Psychology the study of mind as consisting of conations (mental activities or processes), 1-2 B To introduce 'presentations' as mental 'things', over and above physical things and mental processes, superfluous, 2-6 C Consciousness a continuum of activities directed to different objects, 6-9 D An analysis, on these lines, of willing, 9-10 E Confirmation found for this in Ach's experiments, 10-16 F An analysis, on these lines, of ideas. (In Bradley, are they real objects or mental activities?) An idea as a scheme of mental directions, 16-19 G Confirmation found for this in Buehler's 04</page><page sequence="9">ALEXANDER Alexander, S.-continued experiments, 19-21 H Sensations and images. These are conations; and their contents are physical, 21-2 I Presentations. These not mental objects. Except in so far as they are mental activities, they are physical, 21-4 J Though objects physical, psychology (which is knowledge of self) is still possible. I cannot, indeed, be cogmtum to myself; but in having knowledge of an object, I have also the knowledge which consists in this action- an action, of which psychological science is but the elaboration, 25-31 K The objection to psychology, based on the supposed impossibility of self-observation or introspection, 31-3 L A further objection, derived from our power to remember (and to think of) ourselves. The principle that the remembered object is past, but the remembered self is present, 33-40. 7 On sensations and images, Vol. X (1909-10), pp. 1-35 Synopsis: A Examined according to the method I use, the object of perception, though obviously saturated with 'interpretation', yet shows itself as being not mental but external, 1-2 B On this method, the object on the one hand (e.g. the tree I perceive) and the percipience on the other, are two things existing together, precisely as are the tree and the grass, 2-4 C Consciousness' modes vary as its object changes. The variations, I once regarded as qualitative. I now call them differences of direction, 4 D An issue with Stout, as to certain mental existents called presentations which he would recognize in addition to mental conations and physical things. My alternative: mental activities and external objects only, 4-5 E I do not now call all these latter objects physical. They are all non-mental. And images or sensa (as distinct from the sensing and the imaging) are physical when they are of physical things, 5-6 F Acts of consciousness are functions of the body, 6 G The three difficulties of this method which are to be considered in the present paper, 6-7 H (i) Sensations are non-mental. (Under 'sensation' I intend, here, the sensum, not the sentience), 7-13 I (ii) Images. The image, as distinct from the imaging activity, is non-mental. Just as, in perceiving a thing, mind is present with the thing as perceived, so, in imaging a thing, mind is present with the thing as imaged, 13-18 J (iii) Mind's interferences. Subjective mental processes, as revelations of an external reality, 18-22 K Mind's interferences as introducing error. 'Personal' elements in mental process, as distinct from 'subjective'. The helpful amongst the former which reveal truth, and the others which occasion illusion and error, 22-8 L Sensations, perceptions, images and thoughts, as different partial appearances of non-mental objects. Some difficult questions, 28-33 M Appearances and reality, 33-5 8 Self as subject and as person, Vol. XI (1910-11), pp. 1-28 Synopsis: A Introductory, 1-3 B Three current ways of treating the self and self- consciousness, 1-2 C What is to be shown here: the subject is never a presentation: the person partly is and partly not, 2-3 D Description of the three selves. These are three forms of the person, the mainly bodily, the mainly psychical and, thirdly, the spiritual person. In all three, there is the body and there is consciousness. First, the body, 3-6 E Secondlv, what is called the inner self, 5-6 F The subject, or what is called con- sciousness (the experienc-ing in an act of experiencing an object). This consciousness is a thing, and is experienced-though only in its own way, namely by being enjoyed Analysis of an act of perception, 6-9 G Conclusions from this analysis, 9-13 HI Conscious- ness is a becoming, 9-11 I It has duration, succession and degree of strength. Only its affective characters (if these) are to be reckoned 'qualities' which it has. It is in time, 11-12 J Consciousness has volume, has direction and is in space, 12-13 K Combina- tion of subject and body to form the person, 13-17 L Subject and body have place in common, and have movements in common, 13-14 M Consciousness as a property of certain sorts of neural activities, 14-15 N How mental activities have direction, 15-17 O Self-consciousness and self-knowledge, 17-19 P Self not a 'presentation', 17-18 Q Knowledge of it is an experienced experiencing, as distinct from an experienced object, 18-19 R Memory or imagination of myself, 19-22 S Unlike a remembered object, my remembered self is part of my present condition, 19-20 T Analysis of a remembered state of myself, 20-2 U Memory of the bodily self, 22-6 V Analysis of my memory of my bodily condition (so far, at least, as organic sensa constituted this condition), 22-3 W Conclusion, 23-5 X On the appropriateness of 'person' as a term to indicate union of niind and body in the one individual, 25-6 Y Note on sensation and conation as alike mental movement, 26-8 9 Imagery and memory, Discussion, Vol. XII (1911-12), pp. 206-12 Synopsis: A 'Presentation' not a tertium quid between 'act' and 'object', 206-9 B Re- membering as desiring, 208-9 C Image v. memory-image, 209-10 D Memory of my own past state, 210-11 E Instinct, wish, desire, volition, vis-d-vis percepts, images, memories, thoughts, 211-12 05</page><page sequence="10">ALEXANDER Alexander, S.-continued 10 Freedom, Vol. XIV (1913-14), pp. 322-54 Synopsis: A The thesis. Freedom is enjoyed determination, 322-3; B or 'self-determina- tion', 323 C Illustration of the meaning from concrete cases of experience of free- dom, 323-9 D We are freest when our whole being is engaged. Yet this is not the criterion. (Bergson wrong here) For (i) 'Determination by the whole' is by no means confined to us, 329-30; E and (ii) causality (the physical category) is applicable to mental action-'time', 'memory', etc., notwithstanding, 330-42 F Memory. In remembering our former states, we enjoy our past and not any present activity. The past is only continued, in its effects, into the present; as in physical things it also is, 331-6 G When I am enjoying my past in memory, the hypothetical onlooker sees my enjoyment as a present act, 336 H Analysis of causality as used in science, 336-40 I Its applicability to mind, 340-2 J Human action as determined, yet not wholly predictable, 342-9 K What freedom is not, 350-1 L Each extended thing as contemplating the inferior levels, while enjoying its own level, of existence, 351-2 M What exactly is enjoyed as past and not present, when I remember a past mental state? 353-4 11 Space-time, Vol. XVIII (1917-18), pp. 410-18 Synopsis: A The topic: space and time (as such) as we are acquainted with them, 410-11 B Realize what their being duration or their being extension means, and you see that neither space nor time would be what it is except for the other, 411-12 C Every occurrence of a point has its date and each occurs many times. Every occurrence of an instant has its place, and each instant is repeated in many places, 412-13 D Space. It has three dimensions if time is to be a transitive, irreversible succession, 413-14 E Time's movement from past through present to future. This is the 'growth', or historical character, of the world; and (expressed literally) is a perpetual re-distribution of instants of time among the points of space within the one infinite space-time, 414-15. F The world in its historical character composed, not of sections but of perspectives, of space-time, 415-17 12 Beauty and greatness in art, Vol. XXX (1929-30), pp. 205-28 Synopsis: A In morals it is recognized that actions alike in being virtuous, may yet have differing degrees of greatness, 205-6 B Similarly in scientific knowledge. Of statements all alike in being true, one may indicate a bigger truth than another, 206 C So in art a varying greatness is possible, of works all alike in being beautiful, 206-7 D Now beauty in art (as also truth in science and goodness in morals) is of the form; greatness in art (as also greatness in science and in morals) is of the matter, 207 ff E Why this dis- tinction of form and matter gives trouble in art: it is because the artist's subject is foreign to his material, the paint or stone in which he works; but a form has to be given to the latter identical with the form of the subject as he sees it, 207-9 F But is art something made to assume a significant form? What about Wordsworth? Mr. I. A. Richards? 209-12 G Is there a subject in all art, even formal music? The difficulties; but the answer is an affirmative, 212-14 H In formal music, the form itself (of the music) is the subject. And it is not identifiable with the matter (the tones, etc.), 214-16 I If music itself has thus a subject, the apotheosis of it as 'pure art' loses what has mostly been its point, 217-18 J In literature meaning-ful sounds are the material, and the subject is the meaning (of the poem or prose work). But this is not paradoxical. These are not identical, 218-20 K The subject as the artist sees it has a form which he must reproduce in his stone or paint. The result may suggest the subject's mere matter too overpoweringly. This is the way in which the art denounced by the Philistine as 'immoral' may sometimes be genuinely bad art, 220-2 L The connexion of greatness with beauty in art (for their contrast cannot merely disconnect them) lies in this, that the greater the art, the harder it is to get it beautiful, 222-3 M As in the scientific mind, so in the artistic, the world is creating a mirror in which to reflect itself; and the greater the art is, it gives the more completely and concretely the universal meaning of the world, 223-4 N Is there any relation of art and morals, parallel to this relation of art to truths? The problems, 225 0 Tragedy and comedy, 225-7 P Good and evil, as appearing in art, 227-8 13 Form and subject matter in art, Vol. XXXVII (1936-37), pp. 117-36 Synopsis: A The work of art a physical object. The appearances, different selections from which are dealt with by the physicist, the artist, and the common consciousness, are yet appearances of one and the same object, 117-18 B Imputation. This (physical) object has qualities imputed to it by the artist, 118-19 C Is it literally imputing? or is it Einfuhlung? 119-20 D Natural beauty, 120-1 E 'Vision' without expressive power? 121-2 F Form. The meaning imported into the object from the mind's own resources is the form, 122 G The true and the good are other forms impressed on materials thus; but not so perfectly unified, 122-3 H The notion of 'content' another correlate of form, 123 I Sometimes there is no 'content' except simply the material- 'pure music' an example, 123-4 J Usually 'content' includes more, namely something 06</page><page sequence="11">AUSTIN Alexander, S.-continued foreign which the formed materials are to represent-a subject-matter, 124 K Some- times 'content' includes a subject-matter which the formed materials only illustrate, 125 L Didactic art. 'Content' sometimes even includes what must be called a quite extraneous purpose which the art (sacrificing its autonomy) consents to subserve 125 M Prose and poetry, a distinction (of form) found in all arts alike, though only named in literature, 125-6 N Analysis and synthesis. The prose-artist with his analysis, the poet-artist with his synthesis, 127 0 'The beauty is in the form', i.e. in the treatment, not in the subject-matter, 127-8 P The qualities of beautiful treatment, 128-9 Q Of various subject-matters. Do not these differ in 'greatness'? 129-30 R How does subject influence form? 130-1 S Individuality in art-'vision' without the Power of expressing it, 132-3 T The sense in which art simulates nature, 133 U The sense in which, ideally, form and subject are one, 133-4 V Art for art's sake, 134-6 ANDERSON, J.* 1 The knower and the known, Vol. XXVII (1926-27), 61-84 Synopsis: A For realism, knower and known are two different things, but we must have some notion of what sorts of thing these are, 61-5 B Berkeley's mistake, 65-7 C Berkeley may be said to have comnmitted, vis-d-vis the known, precisely Descartes' fallacy about the knower; holding that in perceiving things we perceive them to be per- ceived, as Descartes held that in knowing ourselves we know ourselves as knowing 67-70 D If (as for the realist) knower and known are two different things, then (i) there can be, strictly, no such thing as either sensing or sensa, 70-2; E nor (ii) can there be any ade- quate reason for supposing 'sensible objects' which differ from physical objects. The 'elliptical penny' controversy, 72-7 F In such contexts we are always observing a thing, never a 'datum' or 'sensum' as distinct from a thing, 77-8 G Similarly (iii) the realist must reject the term 'consciousness' or 'awareness'. Criticism of Alexander, 78-80 H If we are able (as we are) to observe situations of the sort 'A knows B', then we can 'contemplate' A (as well as B) and so find it a thing of some sort, possessed of certain characters, 80-3 I Realism is, at bottom, logic, 83-4 ANONYMOUS 1 In Memoriam: Miss E. E. C. Jones, Vol. XXII (1921-22), pp. 224-5 AUSTIN, J. L.* 1 Are there a priori concepts? Symposium, Suppl. XVIII (1939), pp. 83-105 Synopsis: A Assumed connexion between 'concepts' and 'universals', 83 B Universals. Not entities. Statement of usual 'transcendental' argument for entities as (i) common element in sensa called by same name, (ii) themselves non-sensible, 84-5 C Criticism of argument. No 'acquaintance' with universals. Generates nonsensical questions, e.g. relation of universal to instances. Involves questionable assumptions. Several possible arguments for universals all commit fallacy of regarding all words as proper names, 85-91 D The 'universal or concept' terminology a possible but dangerous one, 91-2 E Analysis of questions (i) Do we possess a certain concept? (ii) What is its origin? Both nonsensical because of ambiguous use of word 'concept'. Criticism of views of Berkeley and Hume, 92-8 F What is the issue when questions about possession of concepts are asked? 99 G Special case of resemblance. Are relations sensible? Denial that they are rests on fallacy of regarding isolated words as unit of meaning, instead of the sentence. Criticism of Mr. Maclagan's argument, 100-5 2 Other minds. Symposium, Suppl. XX (1946), pp. 148-87 Synopsis: A Mr. Wisdom asks 'How do we know?' such-and-such. First let's ask about 'know' versus 'believe'. When ordinary people are asked 'How do you know?' the existence of their knowledge is challenged. The existence of their belief is not challenged when 'Why do you thus believe?' is the question. The two thus function differently in speech, 147-51 B The first question. Two types of answer. It may be an answer to 'What indications are you following?' or, on the other hand, 'What past have you had?' ('How do you know?') (i) Observations about the latter, 151-4 C (ii) The 'indications' point: i.e. where 'how do you know?' = 'How can you tell?' 154-7 D Further (more philosophical) points, raised by 'How do you know?' as the words are used, 157-8 E (i) On knowing reality. The question about the reality of anything you 'know' is not, 'is it real?' but 'Has it, or has it not, the features we expect?' 158-61 F (ii) As to the sureness and certainty claimed (sometimes) by saying we 'know'. Are 'sense-statements' (e.g. I am in pain) the sort of thing? Are they sure and certain at all? 'When they are correct and made by X,' does X 'know that thei are correct?' 161-6 G Mr. Wisdom's views. The influence of the direct object after know,' in disguising from him the fact that X may not know (as this 07</page><page sequence="12">AVELING Austin, J. L.-continued last word is used) 166-9 H If I know, can I be wrong? This, too, must be thought out in order to see what the claim 'I know' is. The conditions in which the answer might be yes, 169 if I 'I know' differs from 'I am sure' as 'I promise' from 'I intend', 170-5 J Mr. Wisdom and the case of knowing other minds. Most of the difficulties about what the usage of 'know' is, reappear here, in aggravated form, 175-82 K And at least one special difficulty arises connected with the differences between knowing (i) an emotion's reality, and (ii) a material object's, 182-7 AVELING1, F.

(We could not deny that two or more 'sense-contents resembling in being white' could be in the same field-which - 'white' in several places at once- since that is the analysis of 'white'), 56 F 'All white objects' need not be the collection. It may be an object of different logical type, namely the class. Hence, the resolution of 'white' into 'the objects which resemble-in-being- white' is not nominalism, 56-7 G Have we been explaining universals in terms of a relation (resemblance) which is itself a universal? Our defence. It is only the accident of having to do it in language, which accounts for this embarrassment, 57-8 H 'Quality' versus 'thing'. Two things may have (not, each its own instance of a quality, but) one and the same quality; otherwise, qualities are being spoken of as things, 58 I Ultimacy of the distinction of particular from universal. (i) A universal is constructed out of sense contents, and so cannot be found amongst them, 58-9 J (ii) Universals are indispensable, while (secondary) particulars are not logically indispensable, to our discourse about (primary) particulars, 59-61 K The problem of the universals concerned with inter-subjective communication, 61-2 2 Internal relations, Symposium Suppl. XIV. (1935), pp. 173-85 Synopsis: A Moore, in his refutation of the internal-relations doctrine, appears to regard 'otherness' as a relation which may or may not hold between two things; but if there are two, how could either not be 'other than' the other? 173-5 B The point Moore's pseudo- factual terminology neglects to make: that the statement 'A necessarily has p' is a statement, not about A, but about the proposition 'A has p'; and is to the effect that 'A has p' is analytic, 175 C Formally, a relational proposition is the kind of proposition expressed by a sentence having a preposition or a transitive verb in its predicate, 175 D The refutation of the internal-relations dogma, when we use this terminology, becomes a mere matter of asking whether all true, relational propositions are analytic, 175-6 E We need to give up the pseudo-factual terminology in refuting the dogma of internal rela- tions, 176-7 F No relation is always internal to its terms, or always external to them; and no term stands always in internal relations, or always in external, 177-8 G Mr. Ryle's criticism of the absolute internality of relations, 178-9 H How his pseudo- factual terminology (his use of the material as distinct from the formal mode of speech) can occasion confusion between the logical necessity of which he is speaking, and causal necessity, 180 I Confusion of these two kinds of necessity as a source of the internal- relations dogma, 180-1 J Mr. Ryle's reason for rejecting Hume's analysis of general- law-propositions criticized 181-3 K Why his objections to the kind of analysis of them which Ramsey and Schlick attempt, are not conclusive, 183 ff 3 Verification and experience, Vol. XXXVII (1936-37), pp. 137-56 Synopsis: A Agreement of propositions with reality-what? 137 B The agreement m the case of universal propositions (e.g. all gold is yellow) depends on other proposi- tions, namely singular propositions about particular pieces ot gold, 137-8; C and, 08</page><page sequence="13">AYER Ayer, A. J.-continued ultimately, upon singular propositions (which may be called 'basic') about sense data, 138-9 D Acceptance of 'protocol' (virtually, 'basic') propositions by Neurath and Hempel an in- consistency; since they reject agreement with reality as a criterion of truth, 139-41 E Their criterion of truth a coherence criterion. Price's criticism of coherence, 141-2 F Their theory cannot yield us a criterion of truth by maintaining that 'there can be only one completely coherent system'. 'Protocol' propositions no use here. They give away the case. They still refer to facts, 142-5 G How, then, do basic propositions 'agree with reality', and so qualify for acceptance? Does it all depend on our arbitrary decision? Carnap and Popper, 145-7 H Not 'all'. We do decide where to stop testing a simple proposition. How Carnap is led to assume questions about data to be really questions about linguistic convention. Criticism of the view, 147-9 I The validity of basic propositions depends only partly on linguistic convention. Partly it is a question of fact, 149-52 J What, then, is their 'agreement with fact', or reality? Do they 'picture' it? Or do they exhibit an identity of structure, with it? How verification actually takes place, 152-4 K Verification not to be analysed in terms of cause, 154 L 'Incorrigibility' of basic propositions. A suggestion of Moore's, 154-6 4 Does philosophy analyse commonsense? Symposium Suppl. XVI (1937), pp. 162-76 Synopsis: A There is no objection to our saying that commonsense propositions like 'there is a table in this room' are often known to be true, provided that this is not taken to imply that they are certain, 162-4 B, C, D Philosophers are interested in the analysis, as opposed to the truth, of such propositions; but they are not the only propositions that philosophers analyse. Even nonsensical statements may be philosophically interesting. If one picks out a particular proposition for analysis, it is usually as a specimen of a class of propositions, 164-7 E Analysis is said to bring out the meaning of the proposition analysed. But there is a sense in which one must obviously know its meaning before one can analyse it, 167-8 F It is a mistake to say that what is analysed is the meaning of English words, but it may also be misleading to say that one analyses what the words stand for. Our analysis of, e.g., the relation brother of is about the use of any word which is used in the same way as the English word 'brother' is commonly used, 168-70 G, H, I Lexi- cography is also about the use of words. How, then, do the two differ? Duncan-Jones's suggestion that for one expression to be the analysis of another, it is necessary that it should be 'symbolically more complex' is not a satisfactory answer, 170-3 J Analysis is not always definition in use, 173-4 K The point of analysis is to show up differences in logical form. Attempted definition of 'logical form', 174-5 L When analysis issues in translation, analysis and analysandum ought to be equivalent. Duncan-Jones's counter- example as an objection to the thesis of phenomenalism rather than to the method of analysis as a whole, 175-6 5 Other minds, Symposium Suppl. XX (1946), pp. 188-97 Synopsis: A The problem is not merely, as Wisdom and Austin seem to suggest, whether I can ever know that another person is having a certain experience, but whether I can ever have good reason to believe it, 188-9 B, C, D We are inclined to answer that state- ments about other people's experience refer, not only or perhaps not at all to their overt behaviour, but rather to what is going on in their minds. Some philosophers reject this assumption and hold that statements about other people's experiences are always equivalent to statements about their behaviour. On this view there is no difficulty about there being evidence for such statements, but it is at least very doubtful whether the suggested equiva- lence holds, 189-93 E It may be held that I can have indirect evidence for the hypothesis that another person has private thoughts and feelings which are similar to my own. I am acquainted with my own thoughts and feelings, and can argue by analogy to the existence of his. But this is a peculiar argument from analogy. The peculharity consists, as Wisdom points out, in that the argument is supposed to establish the existence of something which I could not, even in principle, observe, 193-4 F But is it necessarilv true that I cannot observe the experience of another? Certainly each person's experiences are private to himself in the sense that he alone owns them, but does it follow from this that they are also private in the sense of being inaccessible to anyone else's observation? If it does not follow, then the argument from analogy may be valid after all, 194-7 6 Phenomenalism Vol. XLVII (1946-47), pp. 163-96 Synopsis: A If knowledge means 'knowing that', there are not objects of knowledge, and so sense data are not such objects, 163-4 B Sense data are not objects of anv 'act' of knowing. The 'act-object' analysis of sensation is fallacious, 165 C No case for saying that, in perception, the existence of the sense datum before me is indubitable, 165-6 D 'Sense datum' introduced in terms of a special sense of 'see' and 'touch' etc. such that even if one is having a hallucination one is still seeing or touching something. Let the whole of what is 'set up' in this sense at any given moment be called a visual sense field. Then a visual sense-datum is a constituent of this field, 166-7 E Such a sense-field 09</page><page sequence="14">BAIILIE Ayer, A. J.-continued simply appears. No need for any 'act'; and no need to exclude from the field any manner of 'Gestalt', 167-8 F In this sense, if I am perceiving a physical object I must be having sense data before me; but not vice versa, necessarily, 168-9 G In saying, then, that I perceive an object, what more am I saying that that I sense certain data? Phenomenalist's answer: that further sense data would appear, given the appropriate conditions, 169 H Statements about sense data, then, to which all statements about physical objects are reducible, will be partly about hypothetical sense data, 169-70 I Difficulty of giving examples of a physical-object statement reduced to its equivalent sense-data statements, 170-1 J It is sometimes objected, however, that no number of sense-data statements can in principle entail a physical-object statement. The error in this reasoning, 171-4 K A real difficulty in the case. Certain data may often be sufficient evidence of a physical object; but it seems impossible to say what evidence is sufficient and necessary. A physical object is something that can be evidenced in an indefinite number of ways. In terms of sense data, then, a statement about a physical object must be indefinite, 174-6 L What has the phenomenalist done, then, beyond having proposed the name 'sense-datum' for whatever evidences the direct presence of a physical object? 176 M Answer. He has indicated (suitably vaguely) the kind of thing one is saying about sense data, in making a physical-object statement, 176-8 N The difficulty as to how a mere set of possibilities (which is the analysis of an unperceived physical object) can be a cause, has been stressed by Stout and W. F. R. Hardie, 178-80 0 Their objection rests on an insufficient analysis of causation. One point which they have overlooked is that the sensory events into which physical objects and events are analysable are not, like the latter, in physical space and time. Causal statements at the physical-object level may be translatable into statements of correla- tion at the sensory level, 180-4 P The difficulty of the position that the observations implied in the presence of sense data are observations only 'possible in principle' discussed 184-6 Q Price's account of certain further difficulties of that analysis of material- object statements to which the phenomenalist is committed, 186-90 R But Price's ultra-complex 'sensory routes' are not needed in the analysis of statements about events at distant places and times, into sense-data statements. Such analysis could complete itself in terms of the local scenery, 190-2 S 'An observer suitably placed would have' etc. is a formula which suggests the rejoinder 'But when?' a question, however, which is illegitimate. Nor is any reference to a physical observer necessary, or even to 'an observer', 192-5 T The protasis and the apodosis of the statement about sense data, into which a statement about a physical object may be analysed, described. Possibility that the root of the problem is in the different logic of physical-object language and the language of sense data, 195-6 U The ultimate problem, in that case (namely, 'how is physical-object language possible?') to which the phenomenalist has probably in his hands the makings of an answer, 196 7 What can logic do for philosophy? Symposium Suppl. XXII (1948), pp. 167-78 Synopsis: A What makes a problem philosophical? Popper's suggestion that philosophical problems have 'a second-storey character' needs developing, 167-8 B Popper accuses positivists of 'apriorism'. Not certain that this is a condemnation. The verification criterion of meaning, which he gives as an illustration, may be treated either as an empirical state- ment about what is meant by 'meaning', or as a prescriptive definition. In the latter case it legislates for itself, but it has not been shown that this leads to any paradox, 168-9 C Popper speaks of sense-datum theories as aprioristic systems. This is true in so far as to say that one directly observes sense-data is to introduce a convention. But there is nothing objectionable in this, 169 D Phenomenalism considered as an example of a philosophical theory. The question is to what extent statements referring to physical objects are translatable into statements referring to sense-data. In answering this question one hopes to throw light upon what is meant by the former class of statements and so upon the nature of the facts which they describe, 169-71 E How is the validity of such a theory to be tested? By searching for counter-examples. Thus even if Popper is right in thinking that the truth of a philosophical theory cannot be demonstrated, it can at least be refuted. The causal theory of perception is a case in point, 171-2 F Another instance is Popper's own theory that an action is said to be free when no cause can be assigned for it. For it is easy to find counter-examples. Popper appears to confuse causation and com- pulsion. But it may be that he is not trying to analyze our actual usage so much as to recommend a new usage, 172-5 G Criticism of Popper's analysis of causation. His claim that two events are necessarily connected when they are deductively related through some well-established law is no answer to Hume. It is possible here again that he means only to find a usage for the termn 'necessary connexion'. But his proposal is not felicitous. Neither is Kneale's proposal that laws themselves should be said to exemplify necessary connexions, 175-8 BAILLIE, J. B.

H. F. 1 The myth of sense data, Vol. XLV (1944-45), pp. 89-118 Synopsis: A Plain men do not doubt that we have perceptual experiences, e.g., we see tables, hear clocks, etc. Some philosophers have doubted whether what we perceive is the table, the clock, etc. and have argued that it cannot be the physical object but must be something else which they call a sense-datum or sensum, 89-90 B Typical argu- ments for this view are: (1) when we 'look at a penny obliquely' we see something elliptical which cannot be the penny, which is circular; (2) when we look at the straight stick in water we see something bent; (3) we see mirages of things not there, and two things when only one is there, 90-2 C Some philosophers, in this way, came to think that what we perceive is necessarily different from the physical object; and the term 'sense-datum' acquired as part of its meaning 'not a physical object', e.g. in Professor Broad's writings where we find the word 'sensum' used in this way, 92-3 D If sense-data exist, then (i) they are a barrier between us and physical objects, 93-5; E (ii) they are 'queer' existents since (a) some sense-data are indeterminate in respect of a certain characteristic, e.g. so blurred as to be neither circular nor non-circular, (,B) every sense-datum is what it appears to be and cannot be better known, 95-9 F (iii) The 'appearance-reality' problem tends to break out again within the sense-datum, 98-103 G The basic argument for the sense-datum, that, e.g., since (i) I am seeing the rose, (ii) it is red, and (iii) it appears pink, therefore I am seeing something pink, is fallacious. The conclusion does not follow, and is in contradiction with premisses (i) and (ii), 103-6 H Professor Moore claims to use 'sense datum' neutrally, i.e., without the connotation 'not a physical object'. But in so far as it is used with the implication that some existent is revealed as it is, in perception, it is not a neutral term. The neutral assertion is 'something appears', 106-10 I Mr. Ayer's view that the sense-datum language is an alternative to our ordinary language is not borne out by what he says, 110-11 J Dawes Hicks long ago argued (correctly, in the author's opinion) that things appear sometimes to have the qualities they do have, sometimes to have qualities they do not have. There is no such thing as a thing's appear- ances, only the thing and how it appears, 111-17 K There are difficulties about this 'theory of appearing' as to what appears in hallucinations and double phenomena, but this paper is chiefly critical and these must be left to another occasion, 117 2 Intention, motive and responsibility.

A quality is not a kind of substance. That is, no conjunction of adjectives can function as a substantive, 66-8 D This is true of all languages, 68 E Language does not function pictorially.

The idea that lan- guage is pictorial makes us think that each distinct word (substantive, verb, adjective) must represent a distinct thing or object, 69-70 F A picture must be made of some material, and this leads to the truly metaphysical idea that the world which is pictured must be made of some material in the way the picture is 70-1 G Words expressing different modes of sensing (see, hear, smell) have different grammatical properties.

E. Taylor's The Problem of Conduct, this paper intends (i) to defend Green against misinterpretations, and (ii) to reassert the unity of the philosophical sciences, 25-7 B Attempts to oppose scientific description to metaphysical explanation criticized, 27-9, 72-3 C Green's theory of the 'eternal self'. Human consciousness as partially identical with the world-consciousness; 'eternal' in virtue of its apprehension of the world as a whole, 29-33, 71 D Neither psychology nor biology can quarrel with this theory which-contrary to Taylor's interpre- tation-does not imply either the eternity or the absolute unchangeableness of the finite self, 29-41 E While Green's theory of man's 'identity with an eternal whole' has much in common with the metaphysic which Taylor derives from Spinoza, 41-4; F there is total disagreement about the relation of such, or any, metaphysic to ethics; Green, on the one hand, insisting on the need in ethics of certain philosophical or metaphysical concep- tions which no natural science and, therefore, no empirical psychology can supply; Taylor, on the other hand, trying to root ethics in psychology, 44-50, 72 G Such insistence on the aloofness of metaphysic means (i) depriving metaphysic of the 'degrees of reality' which are its content, and (ii) reducing ethics to the employment of inadequate conceptions of commonsense, 46-50 H Taylor's Ethics an example of such failure.

Symposium, Vol. VI (1905-06), pp. 237-47, 262-5 Synopsis: A The answer to the question is 'Yes, except in so far as the thought which logic investigates takes its nature from these conditions', 237-9 B Psychological pro- cess as logical process fragmentized and distorted. Logical process, correspondingly, as psychological process in an explicit and self-consistent form, 239-41 C As a general account of consistent thinking, logic must explain its attitude towards psychological process in general; but to make the truth or falsehood of any determinate train of thought depend on the psychological state of the individual is an entirely different, and preposterous, suggestion, 242-7 D Rejoinder to F.

Answer: The springing of the mere technician, because he is a good technician, into the place of power is, for Plato, a grave social evil, 64-6 E Plato s ideal is the doctrinnairism of the specialist (not 'balanced by the impartial ignorance of the layman-ruler,' but) utilized by the ruler who is an expert in living, 66-8 014</page><page sequence="19">BOSANQUET Bosanquet, B.-continued 16 On a defect in the customary logicalformulation of inductive reasoning, Vol. XI (1910-11), pp. 29-40 Synopsis: A The same, under the same conditions, must produce the same. So far, all are agreed, 29-31 B But treating this as M. Bergson does, robs it of significance and reduces it to tautology, 31-2 C (i) The misinterpretation involved here consists in the demand for a rule which shall say how much variation allows a cause (or an effect) to be 'the same' as another, 32-3 D The only possible rule, here, is one which would destroy the life of knowledge, 33-4 E (ii) Current statements of the theory of induction usually lay themselves open to this sort of misrepresentation, 34-5 F Illustrations showing how a recognized connexion of thought is neither abandoned nor yet just repeated when confronted with new matter.

What is its habitual action at such times? And (ultimately) why? 29-32 C States are different, but in their different ways have the same ultimate task. It is of such a nature that the better they do it the less should they find themselves in opposition to one another, 32-4 D The problem of why states tend to break the important continuities which extend beyond their frontiers, 34 E By their nature they are aiming at elimination of war, however often they get into it, 34-6 F The states have their several contributions to make. And, imperfectly unified as they are, they accidentally get into each other's way, and war follows.

M. 1 The psychology of levels of will, or the possibility of constructing a psychology of growth as well as of sex, Vol. XLVIII (1947-48), pp. 75-1lOH. Synopsis: A Introduction. Psycho-analysis is, potentially, deductive science, operating with two basic concepts, namely psycho-biological level and psychological drive, 75-7 B Main thesis. 'Volition-development (growth) is a psycho-biological drive, and should be added to those usually recognized', 77-8 C PART I, THEORY. Firstly, drive- schema, 79-84 D A psycho-biological drive-schema can now be drawn up correlating four contemporary terminologies (cf. Diagram A), 78-9; E (i) that of Reich showing drive as expansive or contractive action equilibrating the organism, 79-80; F (ii) that of biology, giving basic biological processes, 78, 81; G (iii) that of philogenetic drives towards plasticity or stability, 81-2; H (iv) that of (the later) Freud giving 'reality' and 'pleasure' :principles, 82-3 I This schema would be in accord with the psycho-analytic theory of neurosis, but would reject the early Freudian instinct-dichotomy of hunger and sex, 84 J Secondly, level schema, 84-90 K A corresponding psycho-biological level-schema can be constructed by correlating anthropological levels, psycho-analytic layerings (Reich), Freudian levels and contemplative-religious stages (cf. Diagram B), 84-90 L It is pos- sible tentatively to apply the level concept so reached to other biological sciences, 90-3 M It is also suggested that one drive may preponderate at each level, thus making possible the production of a generalized concept of level-drive, 93-4 N PART II, EVIDENCE, 94-1 1OH 0 Firstly, notes on evidence for the 'novelties' in the set of drive schemata (Diagram A), 94-8 P (i) Possibility opened of ordering behaviour-list in Warden, Jenkins and Warner's Comparative psychology, 94 Q (ii) 'survival' drive (the drive to eliminate rivals) considered as primary, 95 R (iii) 'equilibration' drive (sleeping- waking rhythm) considered as an instinct and as primary, 95 S (iv) 'survival' impulses considered as movements of withdrawal, not of expansiveness, 96 T (v) evidence for differentiating expansive drives of reproduction and growth-volition (a) from D'Arcy Thompson, (p) from psycho-analysis, (y) from contemplative religious development, 97-8 U Secondly. Notes on evidence for the set of level-schemata in general (Diagram B), 98-108 V (i) resemblances between discontinuities in stages of psycho- analytic treatment and of contemplative-religious development, 98-9 W (ii) empirical data given in the study of volition made by Augustine Baker, seventeenth century English Catholic mystical writer, 100-4 X (iii) empirical data on which is based the Catholic terminology of the Three Ways, if this is taken in its original sense, 105 Y Thirdly.

Symposium, Suppl.

XVII (1938), pp. 19-41 Synopsis: A Any causal relations between acts of thinking are the concern of psychology. Russell relies on causal considerations for a theory of logical meaning, 19-21 B Does the sensible fact cause the utterance which expresses it? 21-4 C It is but dogmatizing on Russell's part when he says that the sensible fact partly causes the words uttered, on the ground that he knows it is so, directly, i.e., that he perceives the causal relation, 24-6 D And it implies knowing a complex fact without knowing the simple facts which are its constituents, 26-7 E Russell's claim to be able to perceive a causal relation, 27-8 F A solution which avoids the need for this found in a certain general proposition about my use of language at the time at which I am speaking, 28-9 G The view of general propositions here taken, 29-30 H 'Rules', 30-1 I 'That I am using language in a certain way' not a causal proposition, and it can be known directly, 31-2 J There is direct knowledge, but is Russell's the right account of it? Difficulties in his definition of basic propositions in terms of present psychological indubitability, 32-6 K Difficulties when the basic proposition is defined as one which is psychologically impossible for me to doubt subsequently to my acceptance of it.

Attempt of the logical positivists and others, to restrict the meaning to the methods of the empirical sciences, 147 ff B Emotive mean- ings attaching to the principal senses of the word 'reason', 150ff C Three senses which are important: (i) Reason as the faculty of using language according to rules, in order to convey empircal propositions, (ii) Reason as the faculty of building a system of knowledge, and (iii) Reason as the tendency to moderate belief in accordance with evidence, 153 ff D Rules of language. The unavoidable basic principles of knowledge cannot be explained or 'justified' by logic or metaphysics, but the reasons why they are unavoidable must be psychological, 157ff E Reasoning (Inductive).

Suppl. XXI (1947), pp. 78-103 Synopsis: A The necessary propositions of mathematics and logic are quasi-propositions which illustrate the correct procedure for using (i) numerals, etc., (ii) 'point', 'line', etc., and (iii) the logical constants and quantifiers. Their necessity is just that they are rules, and that to break them is to utter nonsense, 78-83 B Applied mathematics. We apply arithmetic and geometry by procedures of counting and measurement. Where we fnd that a mathematical principle seems to have been violated, we account for it by tracing it either (i) to incorrect counting (measuring) or (ii) to instability in the physical system we are dealing with, 83-6 C Pure mathematics. In pure calculation there can be no reference to any physical system: the test of correctness lies in the agreement of instructed people, 86-9 D Logic. The rules of inference apply immediately to sentences and other expressions in a standard language. This introduces the character of formalism. A natural language is always less rigid than a standard language, 92-100 E It is an empirical truth that we follow the rules we do, but a rule is not itself empirical; it is a quasi-proposition, 89-91 F It is possible to conceive alternative sets of rules for mathematics and, simi- larly, for logic. In the case of logic the possibility is precisely that of having logical constants with quite different rules and meaning, which would be used in statements conveying information, 100-3 3 The nature of arithmetic. A reconsideration of Mill's views, XLVIII (1947-48), pp. 1-12 Synopsis: A John Stuart Mill thought the propositions of arithmetic were empirical. I try to show that, though not empirical, their use and validity does 'depend on experience' in a wider sense. B Mill is really concerned with applied arithmetic: he conceives of number as a property, and of arithmetical operations as physical operations, 1-2 C That the laws of arithmetic hold, in this interpretation, depends on two assumptions: (i) Counting is correct, (ii) the groups are stable, 3-5 D In fact we can never know that these condi- tions hold: hence, no proposition of applied arithmetic has full 'mathematical' certainty, 021</page><page sequence="26">BROAD Britton, K.-continued 5-7 E It follows from Mill's view that the propositions of arithmetic might fail to hold in our experience, 7 F Clearly, they would fail if all counting were unreliable or if all physical groups were unstable. We know by experience that our world is not like this, 8 G Mill meant, however, that the laws of arithmetic might fail to hold even if counting were correct and groups stable, 9-11 H This is meaningless: for the 'uniformities' of arithmetic (where counting is correct and systems stable) are simply features of the cal- culus we employ, 11 I Nevertheless, it is a fact of experience that we can all employ this calculus-that we can all apply the rules of arithmetic and get the same results, 11-12 BROAD, C. D. 1 Phenomenalism, Vol. XV (1914-15), pp. 227-51 Synopsis: A Of the three terms-sensations, sense-data and physical objects-phenomenal- ism claims in some sense to dispense at least with physical objects, 227 B The three terms must be distinguished in any case; the question is whether one or more of them can be defined in terms of the others, 228 C A physical object is conceived as something which is (i) of the same general character as objects of which we are directly aware in sense- perception, and (ii) exists unchanged when no one is acquainted with it, 230 D A sense-datum is an immediate object by means of which a person judges that a certain physical object exists and that it has certain characteristics, 231 E Reasons for doubt- ing whether a sense-datum is ever a part of the physical object which is perceived by means of it, 232 F In view of this it is difficult to justify logically the transition from acquain- tance with a certain sense-datum to belief in the existence of a corresponding physical object. This is one of the motives for phenomenalism, 232-5 G The argument for phenomenalism based on the principle of Ockham's razor. That principle is ambiguous, 235 H Reasons for thinking that the form of phenomenalism proposed in Russell's Our knowledge of the external world has no advantage over the common-sense view from the standpoint of Ockham's razor, 235-8 I Argument for phenomenalism from the principle that all the terms in an empirical law must be observable entities. Russell's theory does not obey that principle, 238 J On that principle the laws of physics must be capable of being stated wholly in terms of sensations, not merely of sense-data, 239 K Three motives which move us to introduce unobservable or unobserved terms (e.g., atoms or microbes) into our statements of physical laws, 240-3 L The first two are not logical reasons against phenomenalism, 242 M If phenomenalism were true it would seem to follow that there are actual events with merely possible causes, 243-4 N The phenomenalist might reply that this objection takes too conventional a view of causation, 244-5 0 The phenomenalist must include in physical laws all those sensa- tions and volitions which are involved in adjusting the body and using an instrument to make an observation, 246 P If we had acted on phenomenalist principles we should never have discovered or verified the laws of physics, 246 Q Is this a logical objection to phenomenalism? 246-50 R Analysis of what happens when a person is led to look for a physical phenomenon because he has deduced it from a physical theory. The phenomenalist must put a special interpretation on such cases, 247 S Often the only logical connexion between a number of phenomenal laws is that they are all deducible from a single physical theory stated in non-phenomenal terms. Analysis of the logic of such cases, 248-50 T Unless we assign a high probability to certain non-phenomenal laws we cannot justify the degree of belief which is attached by physicists to many phe- nomenal laws, 250 U These latter difficulties would not attach to the moderate phenomenalism proposed by Russell in his Our knowledge of the external world, 250-1 2 Hume's theory of the credibility of miracles, Vol. XVII (1916-17), pp. 77-94 Synopsis: A Statement of Hume's theory, 77-82 B Belief in testimony, like belief in causal laws, is based on experience of regular conjunction, 77-8 C If a number of witnesses agree in reporting an event, one's belief will be strengthened as the number of witnesses increases and weakened in proportion as the event reported is contrary to ex- perience, 78-9 D Hume defines a 'miracle' as 'a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity or by the interposition of some invisible agent', 79 E It follows from the definition that, if an event were miraculous, it would be contrary to the whole course of experience; whilst it is not contrary to experience that reports should be false, however numerous and concordant they may be, 80 F In point of fact the evidence for any alleged miracle always falls below the highest standard for three reasons, 80-1 G On the supposition that miracles could occur only in connexion with a true religion, any evidence for the miracles of any one religion is evidence against those of any rival religion, 81-2 H Discussion of Hume's theory, 82-91 I The grounds for distrusting human testimony to the miraculous have been strengthened since Hume's time, 82-3 J Sometimes the indirect evidence for an alleged miracle is much stronger than the direct, 83-5 K But the miraculous explanation of the origin of the story remains the least probable intrinsically, and failure to think of an altemative explanation may leave a number of alternative explanations possible, 84-5 L Hume's definition of a 'miracle' is 022</page><page sequence="27">BROAD Broad, C. D.-continued unsatisfactory. For it is held that there might be several miracles of the same kind; and, unless a miracle is to be a contradiction in terms, it must be admitted that a regularity does not cease to be a law of nature because of a single alleged exception, 86 M What is Hume to say to the first reported exception to any regularity? If Hume is right no one would have any motive for investigating any such reported exception, 86-8 N If several reported exceptions could destroy a person's belief in a law of nature, might not one suffice to do so under favourable conditions? 88 0 A person's beliefs in most of the laws of nature are based on testimony and not on his own observation. Hume ignores this fact, 89 P If there is good evidence for a few exceptions to a well-attested law, we can take two alternative courses. One is to see whether there is something common and peculiar to the exceptions, and to modify the law so as to cover them, 89-90 Q The other is to keep the law unaltered and to ascribe the exceptions to something acting upon matter or other minds in the same direct way as our minds seem to act on our bodies and on themselves, 90 R The notion of 'miracle' involves a special interpretation of the causation of an event. This interpretation is not impossible, but it is never necessary to apply it, 91 S Consistency of the theory with Hume's other views, 91-4 T Since Hume can give no rational justification for induction, the enthusiast's belief in miracles and Hume's belief in natural laws (and consequent disbelief in miracles) are on the same logical footing, 91-2 U Hume has no right to talk about what we 'ought' to believe, as distinct from what we do tend to believe under certain assigned conditions, 92 V He might have replied that, whilst we cannot see why any of the causes that lead to belief about matters of fact should lead to true beliefs, we can see that all such causes except the regularity of our past experiences have a strong tendency to lead to false ones, 92-4 W This position is self-consistent, but it is no ground for saying that no testimony could make it reasonable to admit a miracle, 94 3 Mechanical explanation and its alternatives, Vol. XIX (1918-19), pp. 86-124 Synopsis: A It is strange that controversies about the adequacy of mechanical explanation should have been confined to biology, and that it should be assumed that there is agreement on what is meant by 'mechanical explanation', 86-88 B All explanation requires both general laws and a specified sort of entities subject to them, 88-9 C It might be held that a necessary condition of a mechanical explanation is that it shall be in terms of the laws of motion, 89 D These can most conveniently be expressed in terms of Lagrange's Equation, 90 E Discussion of Lagrange's Equation, 90-102 F General account of the form of the equation and the motion of the variables, 90-3 G Mechanical explana- tion should not be taken to exclude such modification of the equations as might be required by the theory of relativity, 93-4 H Maxwell took non-geometrical variables as geo- metrical co-ordinates in the equations. Are we still to count the explanation as mechanical? 94-7 I Yes, if the non-geometrical variables can be correlated with geometrical variables which specify the microscopic state of the system, 94-5; J and if we also remember that non-geometrical physical quantities are measured by the deflexions or motions of needles, and that these are geometrical quantities, 95-7 K Analysis of the classical account of gravitational attraction into four general conditions, 97-8 L Analysis of the classical account of motion by impact, 98-100 M Classification of various senses of 'mechanical explanation' in ascending order of rigidity. Descriptive macroscopic mechanism. Metrical macroscopic mechanism. Heterogeneous microscopic mechanism. Homogeneous micro- scopic mechanism. Pure mechanism, 100-2 N Three questions propounded for dis- cussion, 102-4 0 Does the possibility of treating a region of phenomena scientifically depend on its being mechanically explicable in any of these senses? 104-9 P Some form of metrical macroscopic mechanism is probably a necessary condition of scientific explanation, 104-6 Q But it is not sufficient, for it might be true and yet the special laws of nature might be too complex in form for us to discover and formulate them, 106 R A microscopic explanation of macroscopic phenomena need not be mechanical, 106-7 S The possibility of dealing scientifically with a region of phenomena does not imply that it must be known to obey, even microscopically, the more rigid forms of mechanism, 108 T This is shown by the success of the old-fashioned atomic theory in chemistry, 109 U But could the connexions between different regions of phenomena be explained unless the more rigid forms of mechanism are true, at least microscopically, of the world? 109-17 V How much unification would be possible if we accepted only the milder form of mechanism? 109 W There could be a hierarchy of laws of decreasing generality. Description of this, 109-15 X A greater degree of unification is possible if homogeneous mechanism is accepted, and a still greater degree if pure mechanism is accepted, 116-17 Y Evidence for and against the more rigid forms of mechanism, 117-19 Z There is no strong reason to think them true; and on the macroscopic level they are certainly false; but it is possible that they might be true at the microscopic level if confined to the material world, 117-18 AA The material world is not the whole of the known universe; for there are the various kinds of sensible quality.

II (1919), pp. 206-20 Synopsis: A Three questions distinguished. The third divides into two, 206 B Is there acquaintance? 206-13 C Acquaintance does not mean 'the sort of relation which a subject has to its awareness of an object', 206-7 D It has been described as 'a direct cognitive relation between a mind and an object', 207 E Ambiguities in the phrase 'direct relation', 207-8 F Two difficulties in giving examples of acquaintance. (i) Acts of judgment nearly always supervene immediately upon it, 208-9 G (ii) In order to describe it one has to describe its object, and in order to do this one has to perform acts of discrimination and judgment, 209 H There is no reason to think that acquaintance ceases when discrimination begins. Altemative accounts of what happens when a person discriminates details in a field of view, 209-11 I Dawes Hicks might object that if acquaintance is described as the kind of relation which a person has to the sense-data that he senses, the description is empty because there are no sense-data, 211-12 J It is no part of the meaning of 'sense-datum' that it should be private and mind-dependent, 211-12 K Dawes Hicks's account of a circular object looking elliptical from the side, 212 L He must take the predicate 'looking elliptical' as ultimate, 212-13 M Dawes Hicks's account of the origin of 'sense-data' in acts of discrimination, 213 N Is acquaintance knowledge? 213-15 0 If 'knowledge' means true judgment, acquaintance is not knowledge, 213-14 P Moore's suggestion that knowledge by acquaintance of certain propositions about a particular is logically prior to acquaintance with that particular, 214 Q Three difficulties in this theory, 214-15 R Acquaintance is not literally knowledge, 215 S What is knowledge by acquaintance? 215-20 T Ambiguities in the phrase 'direct knowledge'. It may mean (i) non-inferential knowledge, 216; U or (ii) knowledge which is not 'by description' in Russell's sense of that phrase, 216-17; V or (iii) infallible knowledge, 217 W Perceptual judgments are founded on acquaintance with sense-data, but are not judgments of acquaintance, 217-18 X Instances of judgment by acquaintance about sense-data, 218 Y No judgment is one of pure acquaintance if it contains, even implicitly, a negative element 218-19 Z Judgments of pure acquaintance are incorrigible; it does not follow that they are infallible, 219-20 5 The character of cognitive acts, Symposium, Vol. XXI (1920-21), pp. 140-51 Synopsis: A Laird thinks it possible to doubt that there are cognitive acts, Moore holds that there is no doubt that there are, 140-1 B This difference arises because Moore defines 'cognitive act' by extension, whilst Laird has in mind some definition by intension, 141 C Those expressions which Moore offers as exam ples of 'cognitive acts' would commonly be called 'cognitions'. To call them 'acts' would generally be held to imply a certain analysis of them, 142 D Three alternative analyses are possible; all presuppose a mental term, a dyadic relation, and an object, 142-3 E It is uncertain which of these analyses Laird would accept, 143 F Laird's statements about cognitive acts are some of them synthetic and some analytic, 143-4 G Sense in which one can always talk of 'the object' of a cognitive act, 144. H Laird's arguments make it practically certain that cognitions and their objects are in general different, 144-5 I B3ut this does not suffice to show that the act-analysis of cognitions is correct, 145 J The facts of memory do not necessitate any form of the act-theory; but they do make one fornm of the act-theory more plausible than the others, 145-7 K Similar remarks apply to cognitions of uni- versals. Summary of Laird's arguments for the act-theory, 147 L Laird says that acts are known by introspection, not believed in as the result of inference. This seems doubtful, 147-8 M Introspection makes us aware of cognitions, and of the non-mental terms in cognitions; but it does not make us aware of the mental term, or of its relation to the non- mental term, if such there be, in a cognition, 148 N Any decision about the internal structure of cognitions must be made on epistemological, not on introspective, grounds, 148-9 0 The fact that one can have different attitudes towards the same object, and that one can know this by introspection, does not entail that introspection guarantees the act theory, 149-50 P Moore argues that even perceptions are complex, and therefore probably all cognitions are complex, 150 Q Moore's argument to show that a red sensum and the seemg of a red sensum are different, 150-1 024</page><page sequence="29">BROAD Broad, C.

We must distinguish 'ownership', 'simul- taneous undiscriminating awareness', and 'introspective discrimination', by a mind, of an experience, 177-8 G Does a person ever own an experience of which he does not have simultaneous undiscriminating awareness? 178-80 H Discussion of the case of a person who looks for an object and fails to find it, although it has actually been within his field of vision, 178-9 I It seems reasonable to conclude that to own an experience and to have simultaneous undiscriminating awareness of it coincide in extension, though it does not follow that there is a single relation here with twb names, 180 J Definitions of 'conscious experience', 'absolutely unconscious experience', and 'relatively unconscious experience' in terms of ownership, 180-1 K Tests for the consciousness or unconscious- ness of an experience 181-3 L Ability to remember, as a test for consciousness, 181-2 M Not remembering that one had an experience, and remembering that one did not have an experience, 182-3 N The latter is a good ground for saying, either that a certain experience never occurred, or that, if it did, it was either relatively or absolutely un- conscious, 183 0 (iv) 'Unconscious' as applied to traces and dispositions, 183-6 P Reasons for postulating traces and dispositions.

This is the premiss, 204 BB Discussion of a case of remembered change, 204-6 CC From the negative fact that we cannot draw the distinction by appeal to the moments of absolute time occu- pied by the events, Kant argues to the positive conclusion that we must draw it by appeal to a certain causal judgment, 205 DD Critical remarks on this argument, 205-6 EE Discussion of a case of perceived change, 206-7 FF Kant ignores the existence of sensations of changes, as distinct from changes of sensation, 207 GG Conditions for perceiving that a change has taken place, where the change is not itself perceived as taking place, 207-8 HH In what way do these conditions involve the category of cause? 208 II Third argument, 208-10 JJ 'How do we know that it is logically impossible for the order of two moments of time to have been other than it in fact was?' 208-9 KK Kant says that this depends on recognizing the causal necessity of the actual order of events, 209 LL The proposition about moments of time is purely analytic; and this fact wrecks the argument, 209-10 MM General Summary. Kant was dealing with a fundamentally important problem, and he was right in thinking that the notion of an objective temporal order is bound up with the notion of cause and substance. But his detailed arguments and conclusions are not acceptable, 210 9 The validity of the belief in a personal God, Symposium, Suppl. VI (1926), pp. 84-97 Synopsis: A The paper is concerned wholly with certain points in Stocks's contribution, 84 B Analysis of a typical emotional situation, 85-8 C There is always a presented object, real or imaginary, and an emotional attitude toward it, 85 D The object need not really exist, but it must be believed to exist or to be going to do so, 86 E 'Immediate' and 'mediated' emotion, 87 F A mediated emotion may be caused by a different characteristic from that which mediates it, 87-8 G Summary of the analysis, 88 H Causal relations of emotion, and belief, 88-91 I There must be a pre-existing emotional disposition in the subject and an appropriate stimulus, 88 J Four possible cases distinguished, according as the emotion aoes or does not generate beliefs about the object, 89-90 K Further remarks about the generation of beliefs by emotions, 90 L Conditions under which beliefs generated by emotion are likely or unlikely to be true, 90-1 M Appropriateness of an emotion to its object, 91-2 N Qualitative and quan- titative appropnateness. Formal and material appropriateness, 92 0 Application to theology, 93-7 P Two objections to describing 'God' as 'the object of the act of worship', 93 Q They might be met by substituting the statement 'A god is a being which is an appropriate object of worshipful emotion', 93-4 R Stocks's account of the characteristics which would make a being an appropriate object of worship, 94-5 S He does not make clear the relation between the religious attitude and the beliefs about the universe, which are associated with it, 95 T Stocks is right in holding that, if the 026</page><page sequence="31">BROAD Broad, C. D.-continued object is to be appropriate it must be conceived as responding to the worshipper, 96 U Are the beliefs which are bound up with the religious attitude valid? Stocks gives a meaning to 'valid' in which the answer is Yes, but it is trivial, 96-7 V If 'valid' means 'true' he gives no answer, 97 10 The principles of problematic induction, Vol. XXVIII (1927-28), pp. 1-46 Synopsis: A Various kinds of inductive argument distinguished, 1 B A problematic induction may be either nomic or statistical, and either an eduction or a generalization, 2 C LOGICAL PRINCIPLES. CONDITIONS FOR A HIGH FINAL PROBABILITY, 2-18 D Prin- ciples of probability and formal logic which are involved, 3 E Artificial problems on drawing counters from a bag, 3-12 F Derivation of the fundamental formula for nomic eduction as applied to a bag, 4-6 G It requires a certain premiss about equi- probability of alternatives, 5 H If and only if a certain further premiss about equi- probability is added, it leads to Laplace's first rule of succession, 6 I This second premiss is indefensible, 7 J A more reasonable premiss proposed. It leads to the con- clusion that the probability of the next counter to be drawn being of a certain kind, is independent of the results of the previous drawings, 7-8 K Derivation of the formula for nomic generalization as applied to a bag, 8-9 L It leads to Laplace's second rule of succession on the same assumption about equiprobability as led to Laplace's first rule in the case of nomic eduction, 9 M Derivation of the formula for statistical generalization as applied to a bag, 9-11 N A new premiss about equiprobability is required to establish it, 10 0 Consequences of adding further premisses about equiprobability, as in the previous cases, to the formula for statistical generalization, 11 P Summary of the logic of bag-problems, 11-12 Q Artificial problems on throwing a counter, 12-13 R Definition of a counter's being 'loaded', 12 S Derivation of the formula for statistical eduction as applied to a counter, 12-13 T Derivation of the formula for statistical generalization as applied to a counter, 13 U TBE CAUSAL PRESUPPOSITIONS OF THE ARGUMENTS, 13-16 V Counter-problems involve a premiss about equiprobability comparable with that involved in bag-problems, 14-15 W Every kind of inductive argument involves a certain causal premiss, 15 X Comparison between this fundamental causal premiss and the law of universal causation, 16 Y CONDITIONS FOR A HIGH FINAL PROBABILITY, 17-18 Z Derivation of the inverted Bernoulli Theorem, 17-18 AA If a high final probability is to be reached a further premiss is needed, which may be called 'The assumption of loading', 18 BB TRANSITION FROM ARTIFICIAL TO NATURAL CASES, 19-23 CC Comparison of the induction about the whiteness of swans with the bag-problems, 19-21 DD There are three differences, all unfavourable to the application of induction to natural cases, 20-1 EE The principle of the irrelevance of mere differences of spatiotemporal position is useless, 21 FF Statement of two conditions which must be fulfilled if inductive argu- ments, applied to natural cases, are to be valid and capable of leading to a high probability, 22 GG This leads to three kinds of question: (i) The purely logical, which has now been answered; (ii) the ontological; and (iii) the epistemic question, 22-3 HH THE ONTOLOGICAL QUESTION AND TH EPISTEMIC, 23-45 II What is attempted here is a development of Keynes's Theory of Generators, 23 JJ Definitions of certain terms, 23-5 KK Assumptions made about generators, 25-6 LL Application of the theory to nomic generalization, 26-31 MM Effect of the relative value of the number of generated characteristics and the number of generating factors, 27-31 NN At best the theory assures us that the antecedent probability of any generalization is greater then a certain number, itself greater than zero, but it does not enable us to estimate this number, 31 00 Conditions which strengthen or weaken the antecedent probability of a generalization, 32-3 PP Tests suggested for the fulfilment of these conditions, 33-4 QQ Consequences of admitting a plurality of generating sets for the same generated characteristic, 34-6 RR Three different kinds of plurality of generators can be distinguished, 34 SS A further pair of alternative possibilities distinguished, 35-6 TT Application to nomic generalizations and to eduction, 36-8 UU Even eduction presupposes universal laws, if it is justified by means of the generator theory; attempt to eliminate the assumption of generators; the generator theory would not suffice to justify the inductive establishment of functional laws, 38-42 VV The epistemic question, 42-5 WW The question of evidence for the assumption of limited variety in nature, 42-4 XX Arguments in support of the assumption cannot be transferred to inductions about mental phenomena, 45 YY Summary of conclusions, 45-6 11 Time and change, Symposium, Suppl. VIII (1928), pp. 175-88 Synopsis: A Macmurray argues that the world could not endure without alteration. His argument is in two stages, and the first is that consciousness would be impossible without change in the subject, 175 B Discussion of the first stage of Macmurray's argument, 175-6 C Attention might be differentiated (e.g. in its objects and in the different 027</page><page sequence="32">BROAD Broad, C. D.-continued intensity with which it was directed to different objects) even if it did not fluctuate, 175-6 D The second stage of Macmurray's argument is that there could be no differentiation in an unchanging world. Discussion of this contention, 176-7 E There might be differentiation without a principle of differentiation and there might be laws of co-existence in an unchanging world, 176 F In his second section Macmurray distinguishes between 'mere alterations' and 'real changes'. His criterion of 'real change stated and discussed, 177-8 G Change can be ascribed, in various senses, to universals, to events, and to things, 178-9 H Change of Universals. They can change in at least two respects, 179 I Occurrences among particulars, 180-5 J Prima facie we must recognize both genera- tion (or annihilation) and alteration of particulars, 180 K Attempts to get rid of the former kind of change (generation) may be either pluralistic or moaistic, 180-1 L Statement of the pluralistic form of this theory, 181 M Statement of it in its monistic form, 181-2 N Discussion of the two forms. The pluralistic is preferable because it does not involve the substantial form of the theory of absolute space, 182-3 0 Attempts to reduce alteration to generation or annihilation, 183-4 P There is a prima facie difficulty if there be continuous changes, but this is not insuperable, 184 Q Summary of this part of the paper, 184-5 R Changes of temporal characteristics, 185-8 S These changes are of two kinds: (i) change of an event from futurity to presentness and to pastness, and (ii) the ageing of things that continue to exist, 185 T Braithwaite's state- ments about the specious present, 185-6 U Is it required to account for our being acquainted with the relation of before-and-after? 186 V Braithwaite's solution of McTaggart's difficulties about past, present and future does not depend on his account of the specious present, 186-7 W The positive part of McTaggart's doctrine is that the notion of past, present and future is logically prior to that of before-and-after, 187 X This is not refuted by Braithwaite's solution of the destructive part of McTaggart's theory, 187-8 Y Attempt to express what seems to be missing in Braithwaite's theory, 188 12 Indeterminacy and indeterminism, Symposium, Suppl. X (1931), pp. 135-60 Synopsis: A PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS, 135-9 B 'S continues to have 0 at t' defined, f35-6 C 'S changes with respect to 0 at t' defined, 136 D Definition of 'deter- minism' in terms of the above, 136 E Two elucidatory remarks on the definition, 137 F Definition of 'indeterminism', 137-8 G Indeterminism about volitions would be a special case of the above, 138 H The question whether volitions are determined distinguished from the question whether they are causally effective. Definition of 'being causally ineffective', 138-9 I ARGUMENTS (for and against determinism) WHICH ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF INDETERMINACY, 139-54 J Arguments for determinism, 140-9 K The a priori argument, 140-6 L Is determinism self-evident or is it a necessary consequence of some tacitly assumed premiss? 140-1 M The latter alternative seems to be true, 141 N The tacitly assumed premiss is certain principles about substance, 141 0 Pre- liminary account of the notion of the 'inner nature of a substance', 141-2 P Distinction between 'first-order' and 'higher-order' properties, 142-3 Q Definition of an 'ultimate property', 143 R Formulation of the 'deterministic assumption' in five propositions, 143-4 S It logically entails determinism, 144 T Three of the five propositions are involved in the notion of substance, The other two can be questioned, 145 U Sum- mary. Determinism is not self-evident; it is a necessary consequence of a tacitly assumed set of premisses, some of which are not self-evident, 146 V Empirical arguments, 146-9 W The main empirical support for determinism has been drawn from the material world, 146-7 X Four arguments for carrying over determinism from the material to the mental realm stated and appraised, 147-8 Y The most plausible of them argues first that volitions are causally ineffective, and concludes that they are necessary accompaniments or consequences of purely material events, 148 Z Criticism of this argument, 148-9 AA Arguments for indeterminism, 149-54 BB The strongest argument is based on certain peculiarities of minds and mental events, 149 CC One is that nearly all mental causation is ostensibly mnemic, 150 DD The attempt to evade this by postulating mental dispositions and structure is, for all practical purposes, a failure, 151 EE A second peculiarity is the individuality and lack of compositeness of human minds, 151-2 FF Detailed account of this. It makes it impossible to verify mental determinism empirically even to a first approximation, 152-3 GG A Third peculiarity is the causation of beliefs and disbeliefs by awareness of logical connexions and dis- connexions, 153-4 HH This is compatible with determinism, but shows that analogies with form matter and the lower kinds of mental occurrences are irrelevant, 154 II STATEMENT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF INDETERMINACY, 155-6 JJ BEARING OF INDETERMINACY ON INDETERMINISM, 156-60 KK The older form of indeterminacy. It weakens the premiss of certain empirical arguments for determinism, which are not in any case very strong, 156-67 LL The later form of indeterminacy 157-60 MM The experimental facts might be accounted for by supposing that, after a 028</page><page sequence="33">BROAD Broad, C. D.-continued certain degree of accuracy in measurement has been reached, the effects of the measuring instrument on the process to be measured cannot be ignored, 157 NN On this view indeterminacy would have no relevance to mental indeterminism, 157-8 00 A second interpretation might be based on the contention that the conditions required for giving a meaning to the 'value of a certain determinable at a point or at an instant' break down in the microscopic world of physics, 158-9 PP Possible bearing of this interpretation on the question of mental indeterminism, 159-60 13 McTaggart's principle of 'the dissimilarity of the diverse', Vol. XXXII (1931-32), pp. 41-52 Synopsis: A Statement of the principle, 41 B McTaggart insists that between any two particulars there must be some dissimilarity which is not analytically entailed by the fact that they are diverse, 41-2 C Since the principle is said to be necessary it is enough to refute it if we can produce merely possible counter-instances, 42 D There might be two sensibilia which were exactly alike in every respect except that one was sensed by one mind and the other by another mind, 42-3 E But it is logically possible that these sensibilia should not be sensed; and then there would be no dissimilarity between them, 43-4 F It is irrelevant to object that they would have parts and that each would have parts not possessed by the other. For this is an analytic consequence of their diversity, 44-S5 G It is possible that there might be two unembodied minds, existing throughout the same period, and that every state of one is exactly like the contemporary state of the other, 45-6 H McTaggart asserts that those who deny the dissimilarity of the diverse are led to do so by drawing an invalid distinction between the 'individuality' of a term and its 'nature', 46 I Reasons for doubting this, 46-7 J McTaggart's attempt to prove that every particular must have a 'sufficient description', 47-52 K Definitions of the terms 'exclusive', 'complete' and 'sufficient description', 47 L If the dissimilarity of the diverse were true, every particular would have an exclusive description. McTaggart claims to infer from this that every particular must have a sufficient description, 47-8 M Attempt to enumerate systematically all possible forms of sufficient description, 48 N Attempt to produce an instance of a universe in which every particular would have an exclusive description even if none of them had a sufficient description, 48-9 0 There must be something wrong with McTaggart's argument. Attempt to state the argument clearly, 49-50 P The argument involves three fallacies; for (i) a particular might be exclusively described by means of a relation in which it stands to itself, 50-1; Q and (ii) if A has to be described by reference to B and B has to be described by reference to C, it does not follow that C must be other than A, 51; R whilst (iii) even if the series had to start and had to continue without end and without recurrence, McTaggart's conclusion would not follow, 51-2 S Summary of conclusions, 52 14 Is goodness a name of a simple non-natural quality? Vol. XXXIV (1933-34), pp. 249-68 Synopsis: A STATEMENT OF MOORE'S THEORY in six propositions, 249-50 B DISCUSSION OF THE THEORY, 250-68 C Is 'goodness' the name of a characteristic? 250-4 D Statement of the theory that ethical sentences are of the nature of interjec- tions or commands, as developed by Mr. Duncan Jones, 250-2 E Two arguments of Duncan Jones in favour of this theory, 252-3 F A further argument based on how we learn ethical words as children, 253 G This theory would have to be refuted before it becomes certain that our question is significant, 253-4 H Is the characteristic (if there be one) denoted by 'good' analysable? 254-9 I Such a question presupposes four propo- sitions which are here enumerated, 254-5 J It is difficult to justify the first and the fourth of these assumptions, 255-6 K Supposing that they can be justified, how are we to set about answering the question whether a given characteristic is simple or complex? Two negative tests for the correctness of a proposed analysis are given, 256 L If it passes these tests we must still ask whether it is an analysis or a synthetically necessary equivalence, 256-7 M At this stage further argument seems to be impossible, 257 N All proposed analyses of goodness seem to most people either to omit something or to be too complex to be correct. What weight should be attached to this? 258 0 A tacit assumption is commonly made at this point. Is it tenable? 258-9 P Some weight should be attached to a general feeing that a proposed analysis is inadequate. But this feeling can also be accounted for on the interjectional theory, 259 Q Can goodness be a relational property? There might be a correct analysis on these lines, partly in non- ethical and partly in ethical terms, 259-60 R Can goodness be a pure relation? Perhaps the fun ental notion might be 'better than', and 'goodness' might be analysable in terms of it, 260-1 S Is goodness a non-natural characteristic? 261-8 T What is meant by calling a simple characteristic 'natural' or 'non-natural'? 261-5 U Moore's account of the distinction in Principia Ethica is unacceptable, 261-2 V Moore's account of the distinction between the 'intrinsic' and the 'non-intrinsic' characteristics of a thing which 'depend on its intrinsic nature', 262-3 W Difficulties in this doctrine, and in the attempt to base the distinction between 'natural' and 'non-natural' characteristics upon it, 263-4 X Attempt to give an epistemological description of a 'natural' characteristic, 264-8 029</page><page sequence="34">BROAD Broad, C. D.-continued Y What connexion, if any, is there between simple and being non-natural? 265-6 Z Goodness is not a characteristic of which we become aware by any of our senses, 265 AA Nor can it be identified with any simple quality of our experiences which we can discern by introspection, 265-6 BB We must beware of comparing goodness with a 'good-making' characteristic, 266 CC If goodness is a simple quality, it almost certainly does not answer to our epistemological description of a 'natural' characteristic, 266 DD If goodness is a simp e characteristic one's idea of goodness must be an apriori concept, 267 EE If goodness be a non-natural characteristic and if the connexion between a good-making characteristic and the goodness which it confers be necessary, there must be synthetically necessary facts, 268 FF Therefore those who deny on principle the possibility of apriori concepts and of synthetically necessary facts will have reasons for denying that goodness is a non-natural characteristic, 268 15 Mechanical and teleological causation, Symposium, Suppl. XIV (1935), pp. 83-112 Synopsis: A INTRODUCTORY, 83-4 B Causal propositions and principles about causa- tion, 83 C Four questions distinguished and the relation between them discussed 83-4 D INDUCTION AND CAUSAL ENTAILMENT, 83-93 E It is alleged that, if and only if the entailment-analysis of causal laws be accepted, is there a rational ground for inductive generalizations, 84-5 F Is it certain that the entaihnent-analysis is the only alternative to the regularity-analysis? And is it certain that, if the entailment-analysis were correct, there would be a rational ground for induction? 85-96 G One premiss of the argument is that, unless induction will justify a belief in certain laws of nature, it will not justify a belief in any proposition whatever, 86-7 H Another premiss is that, if the regularity- analysis were correct, induction could not justify belief in any causal law, 87 I If observed regularity will not justify belief in a corresponding uniformity, a fortiori it will not justify belief in a corresponding entailment, 87-8 J The premiss under discussion must be replaced by four others, 88-9 K The first two of these may be accepted; discussion can therefore be confined to the other two, 89 L Two alternative principles, one about entailment and the other about negative accompaniment, proposed for considera- tion, 89-90 M Restatement of the argument in five propositions, 90-2 N The first three can be accepted. In conjunction with the fourth they entail the fifth. But the fifth is so doubtful that it casts doubt on the prenisses which entail it. The doubt attaches most strongly to the third proposition, 92 0 Summary of the discussion. Reasons why the argument under discussion is important, 92-3 P REGULARITY-ANALYSIS AND ENTAILMENT-ANALYSIS, 93-102 Q It seems on inspec- tion that the regularity analysis is incorrect and that causal laws assert entailment of some kind, 93-4 R The main arguments for one kind of analysis, the difficulties in the other form, 94 S Laws of sequence and laws of coexistence analysed, (i) on the entailment view, and (ii) on the regularity view, 94-5 T In the case of laws of sequence, on the entailment view, there is no analogy to the entailment which is asserted in the case of geometrical propositions, 95-6 U The form of the entailment view suggested by Stout and by Ewing seems too stringent to be plausible when applied to laws of sequence, 96-7 V Distinction between ultimate and derivative laws, 97-8 W Distinction between instantial and non-instantial laws, 97-8 X It has been objected to the regularity view that it can give no account of non-instantial laws, 98 Y The regularity view can give an account of non-instantial laws provided that they are derivative, 98-9 Z Two differences which remain, on this point, between the regularity view and the entailment view, 99-100 AA Laws of functional determination analysed (i) on the entailment view and (ii) on the regularity view, 100-1 BB Two difficulties, one analytical and the other epistemological, in the regularity view of laws of functional determination, 101-2 CC ARE ANY CAUSAL PROPOSITIONS COGNIZED APRIORI? 102-10 DD Definition of the statement 'M has apriori cognition of the proposition x', 102-3 EE If and only if the entailment-analysis be true, is it possible that some causal propositions might be cognized aprion, 103 FF We may think that we have apriori cognition of a synthetic proposition through confusing it with an analytic proposition expressed by a verbally similar sentence, 103-4 GG Stout's example of a psychological causal proposition, which he claims to know apriori, considered, 104 HH Ewing's notion of degrees of insight into necessary connexions needs further elaboration, 104-5 II The notion of a 'smallest sufficient condition' and a 'relatively necessary condition' of an event, 105 The notions of 'absolutely necessary condition', 'greatest absolutely necessary con- tion', and 'order of dispensability', 105-6 KK Statement of the law of universal causation. It and all the other notions introduced above, could be stated in terms of either the entailment view or the regularity view, 106 LL Application of the above to the question of 'degrees of insight' and causal connexions, 106-7 MM Five alternative propositions formulated, and their logical connexions stated, 107 NN The mildest claim to apriori knowledge of causal laws would concern propositions of the first kind; the boldest would concern those of the fifth kind, 107-8 00 The 'growth of 030</page><page sequence="35">BROAD Broad, C. D.-continued insight into causal connexions', of which Stout speaks, might take two forms, 108 PP A 'direct' and an 'indirect' way of rationally cognizing certain kinds of causal propositions can be distinguished, 108-9 QQ Account of the indirect way, 109-10 PER CAUSATION AND CONATION, 110-12 SS The notions of 'co-operative bond' and 'consecutive bond' explained, 110 TT It may be that we derive these notions from our conative experiences, 110-11 UU And it may be that, when we think of the extemal world under dynamical categories, we have derived all those from our conative experience, 111 W But the notions may have undergone an immense modification in the course of being transferred to the external world, 111-12 16 Are there synthetic apriori truths? Symposium, Suppl. XV (1936), pp. 102-17 Synopsis: A Definitions of 'intuitably' and 'demonstrably' apriori as applied to proposi- tions, 102-3 B Three comments on these definitions, 103 C If a synthetic proposition can never be inferred from premisses which are all analytic, it follows that there can be no synthetic apriori propositions unless there are synthetic intuitably apriori propositions, 103-4 D It is doubtful whether the examples which are commonly given of 'analytic propositions' are propositions at all, 104-5 E In that case there are two alternatives open to those who hold that there are apriori propositions and that they are all analytic, 105-6 F Ayer defines 'synthetic' in such a way that all synthetic propo- sitions must be empirical and has thus settled our question in the negative by definition, 106-7 G Ayer gives an independent definition of 'analytic' in terms of linguistic usage, 107 H This definition makes all analytic propositions synthetic and empirical, 107-8 I No proposition which was analytic in the second of Ayer's senses could be apriori in our sense, 108 J And none which was analytic in the first of Ayer's senses could be apriori for anyone but the person who uttered it, 108-9 K Attempt to re- formulate what Ayer probably means by saying that there are apriori propositions and that they are all analytic. It involves five propositions, 109 L Why should empirical syn- thetic propositions of a certain kind appear to be apriori, 109-10 M A proposition which explicitly formulates a linguistic usage which we have all been implicitly following would be synthetic and might well seem to be apriori, 110 N But rules of grammar are propositions of that nature, and yet do not appear to be apriori, 110-11 0 An analogy from geometry. There are intrinsically different kinds of surface, but their intrinsic differences have to be expressed in terms of an extrinsic device, viz., co-ordinates of some kind, 111-12 P Certain intrinsic properties of a surface impose certain very general limitations on the extrinsic devices that can be used for mapping the points on that surface, 112 Q Analogy in this respect between languages and systems ot co-ordinates, 112-13 R If this analogy be accepted there are three possibilities to be recognized, 113-14 S Why is it thought that there are no aprori propositions in the sense defined by us? 114 T One motive is the desire to find something common and peculiar to so-called apriori propositions which will account for their apparent apriority, 115 U At the back of this lies a certain general principle. Is this principle merely an empirical generalization? If not it is itself synthetically apriori 115-16 V The theory that there are no synthetic apriori propositions can be held consistently only by those who regard it as an empirical generalization, for it is certainly synthetic, 116 W Those who hold it ought to support it by a detailed investigation of all the main types of ostensibly synthetic apriori proposi- tions, 116-17 17 The philosophical implications of foreknowledge, Symposium, Suppl. XVI (1937), pp. 177-209 Synopsis: A Classification of alleged cases of supernormal cognition, 177-8 B The evidence in favour of supernormal precognition is adequate unless there be some apriori impossibility in the notion of such cognition, 179 C The epistemological objection, 179-89 D It is concerned only with veridical precognition which is non-inferential, 179 E The difficulty alleged is that the object would have to stand in a certain relation to the precognizing subject at a time when the object did not exist, 180 F The same objection could be raised against the possibility of memory of events, 180 G Non- inferential precognition would resemble memory rather than sense-perception, 180-1 H 'Ostensible remembering' defined. It may be either veridical or delusive, 181-2 I It involves a present image and an act of 'retrospective reference'. An image may be in fact 'retro-presentative' without being retrospectively referred by the subject, 182 J The sense in which retrospective belief is 'based upon' ownership of a present image in the case of memory, 183 K Comparison between this and the part played by sensation in sense-perception, 183-4 L The epistemological objection to memory depends on the assumption that to remember is to have a present prehension of a past event, 184 M The correct analysis is that a judgment about a past event is based on prehension of a present image, 185 N The wrong analysis is made plausible by ignoring delusive ostensible memories; and by thinking that, because memory is non-inferential it must be purely prehensive, 186 0 The plain man tends to regard sense-perception as purely prehensive, 185-6 P 'Ostensible foreseeing' defined.

We confine it to non-inferential postcognition of events which were either past experiences or objects of past experiences of the remembering subject, 190-1 Y The case of Miss Moberly and Miss Jourdain. It puzzles us because it seems to involve veridical non-inferential postcognition of past events which do not fulfil either of these conditions, 191-2 Z To avoid the causal difficulty here one is inclined to postulate either pre- existence of the subject, or traces carried by external material objects, or communication from the spirits of the dead, 192 AA Ostensible precognitions must be divided into those which are, and those which are not 'intra-subjectively circumscribed'. The latter can be subdivided into three classes, 192-3 BB Analogies between the various kinds of ostensible precognition and the various kinds of ostensible postcognition, 193-4 CC The causal objection attaches equally to all forms of veridical precognition, but only to some forms of veridical postcognition, 194-5 DD Five alternative theories to avoid the causal objection, 195-6 EE They all involve either supernormal processes or supernormal agents or both, 196 FF Analysis of causal objection, 196-7 GG To assert that the correlation between an earlier image and a later event is not a chance- coincidence is equivalent to asserting one or other of three alternative propositions about causation, 197 HH One of these seems to be ruled out by a self-evident principle about causation. The other two are equivalent to two of the five theories enumerated above, 197-8 II All possible theories about veridical ostensible foreseeing must be variations on one or other of four alternative theories. But it is impossible to bring some of the best cases under any of these heads unless we postulate additional dimensions of space or quite unfamiliar agents and causal laws, 198 JJ Mr. Dunne postulates additional dimensions of space.

Example from Euclid of a 'demonstration', 4-5 I Kant's account of geometry considered, 5-16 J He is right in saying that the properties of a triangle do not follow from its definition alone, 5 K This can be reinforced by the fact that a triangle has different properties in different systems of geometry, though it has the same definition in all, 5-6 L But the properties do follow from the concept of the figure and the axioms of the system of geometry under consideration, 6 M Kant might have replied that intuition is needed to guarantee the axioms, 6-7 N It is not needed in pure geometry, because all the propositions are hypo- thetical, 7 0 No doubt intuition supplied the first stimulus to geometry, 7-8 P And, in a very wide sense of 'constructing', the concepts of any system of geometry have to be constructed in the number-system, in order to show that the postulates are consistent, 8-9 Q Kant might have replied that intuition is needed to show that one set of postulates- 032</page><page sequence="37">BROAD Broad, C. D.-continued those of Euclid-are true of the space of nature, 9 R The consequences of supposing that we know this are, as Kant realized, highly paradoxical. Do we in fact know it? 9-10 S Division of Euclid's axioms into three classes, 10 T (i) That which is peculiar to Euclid-the parallel postulate-is not self-evident; and intuition throws no hight on its truth or falsehood, 10-11. U But it, in conjunction with the other axioms, entails certain other propositions which do seem self-evident; and these other propositions, in conjunction with the axioms, entail it, 11 V The evidence for the peculiar features of Euclidean geometry is partly empirical and partly a matter of convention, 11-12 W (ii) The axiom of free mobility is common and peculiar to all systems of geometry which allow of a distinction between space and its contents, 12 X It has been alleged, e.g., by Russell at one time and by Whitehead, that, unless this distinction could be drawn, know- ledge of general facts about nature would be impossible. If so, a transcendental proof of the axiom of free mobility could be constructed, 12-13 Y Kant puts the axioms of geometry on a higher level of certainty than the principles of pure understanding. It is doubtful whether this is consistent, 13 Z (iii) The axiom that the shortest distance between two points is the straight line joining them is common to all systems of metrical geometry. It needs to be restated, 14 AA In the case of non-homaloidal spaces it is a mere definition of 'straight line'. But this is not so for homaloidal spaces, 14-15 BB Discussion of the nature of this axiom, and the evidence for it, in the case of homaloidal spaces, 15-16 CC Kant's account of arithmetic considered, 16-20 DD No one doubts that the propositions of arithmetic are apnori. But are they synthetic? 16 EE What objection would Kant have to Leibnitz's attempt to prove that 3 + 2 = 5 from definition? 16-17 FF Perhaps he would say that intuition is needed to establish the associative law, which is involved in Leibnitz's proof, 17 GG The problem of addition stated in terms of the Arabic system of notation, 17-19 HH Intuition in the primary sense, is needed to establish those propositions which enable us to set up the Arabic system of notation. After that we need only to intuit the symbols for numbers in that notation, 19 II Arithmetic has no special connexion with time, 19-20 JJ Kant's account of Algebra considered, 20-4 KK Two passages quoted to show his views on this subject, 20 LL Kant has now completely altered the meaning of the phrase 'constructing a concept in intuition', 20-1 MM The 'instantial' and the 'non-instantial' construction of concepts, 21 NN 'Illustrative' and 'shorthand' symbols, 21-2 00 Even geometrical figures are really but illustrative symbols, 22 PP Kant recog- nizes this when he distinguishes 'schemata' from images, 23 QQ Everything that Kant says about algebra could be said of symbolic logic; yet Kant regards the former as synthetic and the latter as analytic, 24 19 The relations between science and ethics, Symposium, Vol. XLII (1941-42), pp. 1OOA- lOOH Synopsis: A The nature of goodness, 10OA-1OOB B Waddington says that goodness cannot be defined non-tautologically, and also that it is a causal-relational property, IOOA C Attempt to remove this inconsistency, and also to explain what Ewing says about 'good- in-itself' by a distinction between goodness and 'good-making characteristics', lOOB D Knowledge of the presence of goodness, lOOB-lOOD E Does Waddington admit that one can sometimes recognize the presence of goodness by inspection?

How the subjective theory would deal with these, 136 H We consider secondly the objective theory of deontic cognition, according to which a deontic judgment ascribes to an act a certain quality, relation or relational property which has no reference to human feelings, desires or opinions concerning that act. We note the most important principle of division of its various forms. The meanings to be attached here to 'naturalistic' and 'non- naturalistic' as characters of ethical theories, 136-8 I (ii) Alternative epistemological theories of deontic cognition, 138-42 J How any moral-sense theory of singular deontic judgments which regards 'that act is right' as analogous to 'that thing is yellow' acquires a quite different force according as it interprets 'that thing is yellow' (a) in a naively realistic or (b) in a 'dispositional' manner, 138-42 K The naively realistic alternative, 140-1 L The 'dispositional' alternative in its two varieties, trans- and intra- subjective, 141-2 M Of these forms of the moral sense theory the only two which are worth considering seriously are the naively realistic and the trans-subjective variety of the dispositional. The naIvely realistic form of the moral sense theory, 142-7 N Why the moral sense theory, in its nalvely realistic form, breaks down when applied to singular deontic judgments made by a person about the acts of another. Such deontic judgments, in order to be parallel with judgments of visual and tactual perception, would have to imply acquaintance with the other's inner mind, 143-4 0 When the act is the judger's own, this criticism not applicable, 144 P But another is, 144-5 Q A further respect in which the singurr deontic judgment differs from visual or tactual perceptive judgments, profoundly, and to the discomfiture, inter alia, of the naively realistic form tof the moral sense theory, 145-7 R We turn now to the trans- subjective variety of the dispositional form of the moral sense theory, 147-66 S Assum- ing that 'moral feeling' is of the nature of emotion, some preliminary observations upon emotion, 147-8 T Here we at least do not have to ascribe to the judger of another's act, actual acquaintance with the other's inner mind, 149 U But three difficulties. The first of these (possibly surmountable) concerns the ground of judgments like 'that act is right', 149-50 V The second (substantially-Richard Price's objection to the moral sense theory of ethics) is that it translates certain necessary propositions which are know- able apriori, into a form which would make them contingent, and knowable only empirically 150-1 W Firstly, are those propositions (e.g. 'any act of promise-keeping tends as such to be right') perhaps not necessary? 151-5 X The two forms of a possible attempt to prove that they are not, with an assessment of the value of this attempt, 152-5 Y Secondly, could not the propositions into which those are translated, be maintaned to be necessary? 155-60 Z A third difficulty. The rationalist account of moral emotion, 160-3 AA Can the moral sense theory (in its trans-subjective dispositional form) make any answer? 163-6 21 Some methods of speculative philosophy, Suppl.

Hume and Hegel two extreme cases, 2-3 D All philosophical work involves some degree of analysis, and some degree of synopsis. A third factor,-synthesis-generally present also, but may be almost absent. Analysis will not be further treated here. Synopsis and synthesis specially characteristic of specula- tive philosophy, 3-4 E Synopsis is the deliberate viewing together of aspects of experience which are generally viewed apart, and the endeavour to see how they are inter- related, 4 F Examples of synopsis.

The philosophic importance of these facts is that they conflict with certain very general restrictive principles which are almost universally accepted, 11-16 J Synopsis and analysis. The intellectual discomfort which arises from prima facie inconsistencies first disclosed by synopsis is the commonest stimulant to analysis, 16 K Synopsis and synthesis. Synopsis is the basis for synthesis which seeks to supply a set of concepts and principles which shall cover satisfactorily all the regions of fact which have been viewed synoptically, 16-17 L Further remarks on synopsis and synthesis. (i) Typical instances are to be found within physics. Sometimes a philosopher suggests a physical synthesis which only a trained mathematician can formulate and develope. Cf. Spinoza and Lord Kelvin's vortex theory of the atom, 17-19 M (ii) Synopsis and synthesis take place at successive levels and a synthesis which works up to a certain level may need to be revised at a higher level. Cf. Bergson's selective theory of perception and memory in reference to para-normal cognition, 19-20 N How are principles of synthesis discovered? No general rules can be given, but the following remarks on procedure may be made (i) Attempt to carry over an explanatory principle with modifications from a region where it obviously holds to those where its holding is not obvious. Discussion of Aristotle's notion of matter and form in this connexion, 20-22 0 (ii) Attention to marginal and abnormal cases within familiar regions of phenomena. General statement of the method. Examples from visual perception, from psycho-analysis, and from abnormal psychology (a) The study of certain branches of mathematics furnishes good training and good examples of this method. Cf. non-Euclidean geometry and the notion of logical constructions. (O) regions of fact fall into a hierarchy, and synthesis may take the form either of reduction or of sublimation. Attractions and dangers of each kind of synthesis, 23-7 P How are proposed principles of synthesis recommended? In former times the method was often that of deduction from supposedly self-evident synthetic premisses. This has been largely abandoned. Cf. Whitehead and Alexander. Examples of predominantly deductive synthesis: Spinoza's Ethics, McTaggart's Nature of existence, 27-9 Q Two remarks on deductive systems (i) Much influenced by the success of Euclidean geometry, the nature of which was misunderstood until quite recently.

He attacks Plato's ideal as allowing too little 'subjective freedom' and Kant's definition as too formal, i.e. allowing too much subjective caprice. His vacillation between definition and propaganda leads to vacillation between an ideal and actual state, 226-35 D His own definition of Sittlichkeit allows less 'subjective freedom' than Plato's 'rule of reason in the soul', 235 E Nor does it escape the charge of excessive subjectivity brought against Kant's definition, for his citizens obey good laws willingly, 235 F His favourite Prussian constitution allows little more 'subjective freedom' than Plato's ideal and has not safeguarded the wisdom or communistic disinterestedness of the rulers, 235 G His 'ethical state' is less acceptable than Kant's 'Kingdom of Ends' since it allows no individual claims to justice or to a share in the benefits of the kingdom, 236 CASTANER, C. 1 The ideal and the real, Vol. XXX (1929-30), pp. 179-204 CATLIN, G.

This, like other studies following accepted scientific methods, is entitled to abstract a field from experience 'as if' it were the whole, and to subject it to investigations which are to be judged by their pragmatic effect in illuminating controls in the selected field, 100-04 C For political science the ends are assumed; the field of study is that of social occurrence and recurrence limiting means. x end will require xl means, so determined; and y end y' means, 104-7 D No one 'political end' can be discovered, e.g., not 'harmony'. What is possible is a study of means within the selected field, governing the attainment of various ends, 107-9 E The permanency of human nature, moulding the 'social facts', introduces constants which permit of a study of means, 109-10 F This can be described as a study of objec- tive natural law in the field of relations of the human wills, 110-11 G Political Philo- sophy.

(Anselm was talking neither about the fortunate islands nor about a hundred dollars). Kant's criticism rejected. Kant himself as having reintroduced the Argument in Book ii of his second Critique. Croce equally at fault. The word proof inapplicable in philosophical discussions. The phrase weighty considera- tions preferable. A difficulty: is not the argument applicable to the Devil? The Devil as an imperfection and a creature. S. Anselm is thinking of a certain nihil maius etc., applicable only to God, 367-76 C Conclusion: not only is the ontological argument valid, but, as against Dr. Webb's view, it does include person and personality as perfec- tions. W. E. Hocking's acceptance of the Argument, 377-84 3 Prayer: psychologically and metaphysically considered, Vol. XXIV (1923-24), pp. 185-212 Synopsis: This paper (evoked by one of Wildon Carr's) makes a psychological analysis of any and every moment of experience; it contends that, always, there is a factor which may be called the petitionary factor, and that we are always praying either to God or devils of our own devising. Reference to Marrett and to Otho's Das Heilige. A fourfold analysis of levels of prayer (i) the egocentric, (ii) the anthropocentric, (iii) the egotheocentric, (iv) the theocentric. Only the last (pre-eminently aesthetic and unitive in character) is prayer at its highest. Discussion of the ligature in S. Teresa. Sir Cecil Spring Rice's translation of the Sonnets by el Hallaj (Arab mystic crucified in the eleventh century). Prayer defined as the act of attention directed upon God. Book XIV of Wordsworth's Prelude as an example, 185-212 4 What does it mean to be a person? Vol. XLVII (1946-47), pp. 129-42 Synopsis: The extreme prominence of the word 'personality' in poetry, philosophy and politics from Wordsworth's day till our own. Further, no Gifford Lecturer ever raised the previous question; for personality is an abstract noun derived from person, and the important and most intractable question is 'What does it mean to be a person?' Boethius avoided it ab initio. Personal experience the only legitimate way. Experience, 'the process of becoming expert by experiment' (Ward), involves two and not one. Experience is not solitary, but a dialogue. There is always confrontation of a presence not to be put by; confrontation of person, the eternal person, with me, a person-in-the-making. Some marks which show what it means to be a person-in-the-making, namely: Such an one is a unity in diversity; is alive; is creative; is embodied; manifests and wields the categorical impera- tive; is vocal, not speechless; has a special note of privacy, of possession, and of being possessed; of freedom. (Refer here to Martin d'Arcy's 'Mind and heart of love'). Finally, what does it mean to be a person, in conditions of pain? 'Pain and love best bring out the relational aspect of being a person amongst persons'. Yet Patripassianism to be rejected, 129-42.1 CODDINGTON, F.

Relation of the state to particular associations, 140-1 B Within the unity of ethico-political conduct, the valid distinction is corporate versus individual acts, not state versus non-state activity, 141 C Support, in Rousseau, for the view that his city state, in relation to any socio- political world-organization, would be one of the members on whose wills the wider organization was founded, 141-2 D The state and private associations. Rousseau's regarding of private associations, with their particular corporate wills, as an imperfection to be eliminated from his city-state, with only the exception of government. His view of the need to guard against the tendency of the latter to usurp the right of the whole people to be sovereign, 142-3 E The nineteenth century had to learn that such par- ticuiar human groupings need not be vested interests standing for exclusive privilege, but might be functional agencies working in the public interest, 143-4 F Our topic is associations within a national area, not beyond it. 'State', 'association', 'society', 'com- munity' as understood in this discussion, 144-5 G Three views of the relation of the state to associations. The view that the state is universally sovereign, having no limits to its sphere of action, came to the front in its modern form, in an epoch of revolutionary democratic movement, 145-9 H The general will, to which in a rational society the individual is ultimately obliged to conform, needs all associations to express it, and not the state only, 149-51 I There must be some way of so unifying the community, that each of two kinds of purpose may be fulfilled by its membership; namely, those which (i) affect them approximately-equally, and (ii) those which (like, e.g. industrial or religious purposes) affect them unequally, 151-3 J The state only one association among many; one which, if it includes everybody does not include the whole of anybody. To find where ultimate sovereignty lies, it is necessary first to delimit the sphere of action of different kinds of association, 153-5 K Its ultimate location in some form of federal structure. This remains inevitably imperfect as representing the 'general will' only of society, not of the community, 156-8 L We thus arrive at a principle of functional devolution. 'Society' as a federal group has the last word in legal determination. In case of conflict, duty must be matter for individual decision, 158-9 2 The nature of the state in view of its external relations, Symposium, Vol. XVI (1915-16), pp. 310-25 Synopsis: A The topic of this paper: the state, in relation (i) to other states, (ii) to its own citizens in dealing with external questions and (iii) to citizens of other states and members of foreign (non-governmental) groups, 310-11 B The danger of theorizing about 'the' state, rather than states, 311 C The unwarranted re-merging of the individual (whom Kant had regarded as an end in himself) by post-Kantian philosophers, in the state. The merging (equally unwarranted) of individual states in a world-federation, which is suggested now, 311-13 D The non-political bonds between men which may conflict with their loyalty to the state, 313 E While both states and men may have conflicting allegiances the latter are whole individuals as the former are not, 314-15 F Adequate political theory must leave men free to limit their duties towards the state, 315-16 G The hindrance which a theory of state sovereignty must occasion to any movement towards a world federation of states, 316 H The international allegiance of non-governmental groupings (e.g. socialists, Roman Catholics) with which their state allegiances must not be stressed to the point of conflicting, 316-18 I The state's claim vis-a-vis other claims. No difference in kind, 319 J States are less democratic in external affairs than in internal. Obligation is more or less perfect, according as the state is more democratic or less.

State loyalty' as only one aspect of a wide complex of natural (qvacrv) loyalties, 153-4 D The power of men to hold together in association, is a matter rather of their impulse to loyalty than of their sense of obligation, 154-6 E The element of universality (which Rousseau fails to recognize in the loyalty to a particular association) really saves it from being, as he thought, merely particular in relation to loyalty to the state, 156-8 F All of the groups through which the individual wills (either in his personal, in a sectional, or in a general interest) express sociality in some form, 158 G The ascendancy in recent years of the writer's political pluralism as against state sovereignty, has left the function of the individual will or conscience (as arbiter in conflicts of loyalty) ripe for further study, 159-60 H The best community-that which gives fullest expression to the social will-is one in which the wills of individuals find their fullest expression in a rich diversity of free associa- tive life, 160-1 I The good made possible by such a life is no more severely qualified by the evil which it, of course, also makes possible, than would be the case if all loyalties were directed exclusively towards the state, 161-2 J The broad conception of a common plan giving each particular association a 'place in society'. Its influence in eliciting action from men's better motives. The notion of function here, 162 K The mischief done to the 'harmony' of such a plan, if, as in Hegelianism, the state tends to be conceived as by nature opposed to the life of non-governmental associations within it, 163-4 L The voluntary principle. Its importance for the harmonious meeting especially of new and changing needs, 164-5 M What is legitimate and what is perverse in our treatment of the large irrational element which enters into most loyalties, 165-6 N Freedom in associative life, as safeguard against perversion of loyalties, 165-6 0 Such freedom must, however, be supplemented by a basis of common ideas and assumptions, 168 P Sometimes, men have to back their loyalties against their judgments when this common basis is en- dangered, 169 Q The twofold harmony-of men with institutions and of institutions with the basic conditions of life-which makes free, rational loyalty possible, 169 R The importance of diversification. Concentrated on the general to the exclusion of the particular, loyalties become irrational, in a manner equally fatal to fellowship and to liberty, 170 COLLINGWOOD, R. G.* 1 Can the new idealism dispense with mysticism? Symposium, Suppl. III (1923), pp. 161-75 Synopsis: A With Croce and Gentile mysdcism is religion. What is depreciatory in their attitude to religion is accidental and impertinent, 161-4 B Theirs (at any rate Gentile's) is not a philosophy of change, 164-5 C Its 'reality', indeed, is history; but history is not change. History is change originated by mind in itself. Mind is thus above the change while still identified with what is changing, 165-7 D This, surely, is mystical; and it is not 'mysticism minus transcendence' in any sense in which 'transcendence' was important to mysticism, 167-8 E Croce and Gentile in the full tradition of post-Kantian idealism, 169-70 F They therefore believe, contra Bergson and even Aristotle, that ultimate truth is accessible to thought; and the mystic may be thinking even if he may not so report himself, 170-2 G How a modern idealistic philosophy might go about to make this clear, 172-5 2 Sensation and thought, Vol. XXIV (1923-24), pp. 55-76 Synopsis: A Sensation and thought are not two distinct cognitive activities, however 'inseparable', 55-67 B They are not two ways of knowing, but a single activity with a single object not divisible into a sensum and an intellectum, 57-8 C (i) A pure object of sensation would have to be something, human awareness of which is inconceivable, 58-62 D Reasons why we also could not be conscious (ii) of what a pure object of thought (a world of mere universals) would have to be, 62-5 E The mischief wrought by the fallacy of 'thought and sensation' as 'two elements united in knowledge'. How, e.g., it turns reality and appearance into a distinction, not of two interpretations, but of two sense data, 65-8 F It would require, e.g., that our visual sense-data should come before us 'as pictures correctly drawn in perspective'. Do they? 68-72 G The fallacy that what is inter- preted cannot be anything, if every so-called sense datum be (not a datum but) an interpre- tation. It is presumed (without justification) that knowledge, being always mediated, cannot have immediacy, 72-6 3 The nature and aims of a philosophy of history, Vol. XXV (1924-25), pp. 151-74 Synopsis: A What the philosophy of history is not; namely, an account either of a system of abstract and universal laws recurrently exemplified in the course of events, or of any 046</page><page sequence="51">CONZE Collngwood, R.

It involves an analysis of both his procedure and his ideal, 161-2 D The relations of history to art, to science and to philosophy, 162-5 E These four not species of a genus, 166-7 F All history an elaboration of, and an enrichment of the world as given in perception, 167-71 G The historian as such a monad, and without windows. History and philosophy, 171-4 4 Some perplexities about time: with an attempted solution, Vol. XXVI (1925-26), pp. 135-50 Synopsis: A Difficulties of time when we begin to think about it: some (of the less serious) which are not to be discussed here, 135-8 B A major one: we seem to be continually assuming time to be what we yet know it is not. It is not anything (i) that flies, 138-9; C or (ii) that can be measured, 139-40; D or (iii) that can be (intelligibly) called either continuous, 140-2; E or (iv) infinite, 142-3 F What is it that makes the statement that time is any of these things false? Chiefly our habit of spatializing it, as a line, and so coming to think that past and future exist. Our error in this. Do we really 'know' either past or future? The difference of the two, 143-7 G The problem: what is time, that it should seem (appear) to be both a totum simul and its contradictory opposite, a sheer flux? 147-9 H A suggested answer, 149-50 5 Political action, Vol. XXIX (1928-29), pp. 155-76 Synopsis: A Political theory, whether pluralistic or monistic, comes to an impasse through taking as its problem What kind of a thing is the State? instead of What kind of action is political action? 155-8 B As economic and moral action are autonomous in their several spheres, so must political action be within its sphere, 158-9 C It has a specific sphere. Action (e.g. an act of social reform) may sometimes be justified simply as a political good, without contributing particularly to any other kind of good, 159-63 D 'Why seek political good' as a kind of question people do not raise, 163-5 E Political action as the instituting of order for the sake of there being order, 165-7 F Political ordering has no absolute beginning, 167-8 G If there is always political order, what is there more of, if there is progress in the political sense? Ultunately, of the outer conditions necessary to that inner order of the individual which constitutes his freedom, 168-70 H The bearing of this on political pluralism, 170-3; I and on the problem of sovereignty, 173-6 6 On the so-called idea of causation, Vol. XXXVIII (1937-38), pp. 85-112 Synopsis: A Why we must begin by distinguishing, in the word 'cause', three senses, 85-6 B Sense I is that in which we 'cause' an agent to go into action in a certain way, by giving him a motive, 86-9 C In sense II the 'cause of any state of affairs marks the point in them, at which control of them is possible, 89-90 D In so far as natural science is, in the Aristotelian sense, a practical science, it searches for such 'causes', 90 E The cause (in this sense II) of an effect is one amongst the many conditions of it, 91-2; F which one, depending upon which one the person speaking has in his power, 92-3 G For a person having no power over any of the conditions, there is no 'cause' in this sense, of the state of affairs, 93-4 H So this sense II, of 'cause', is 'means of controlling', and such means are called 'cause' because of the flavour of compulsion which the word carries. Further, the?avour is at root that of a social or animistic compulsion, 94-6 I In sense III of 'cause', the cause is (Mill) all the conditions, 96-8 J H ow does 'all the conditions' necessitate the effect? By implying it logically? By having been conjoined with it regularly? Neither alternative will do, 98-101 K Is this causal necessitation (compare B. A. W. Russell) something predicated of a propositional function? Three difficulties, 101-2 L What further, then, that is (i) different from logical implication and (ii) more than bare uniform conjunction, are we to say that causation (in sense III) is? The answer is that it has in addition, a socially-derived note of compulsion which, though not alien to Newton, is quite alien to the spirit of post-Newtonian physical science, 102-6 M As to Kantianism, the only sense in which every event 'has a cause' is one in which the said cause cannot be (what Kant, propounding the 'law', thinks it is) namely a previous event. This Kantian confusion afflicts the theories of Mill, B. A. W. Russell, Ayer, Frank, Prichard, J. M. Keynes and John T.

Symposium, Suppl.

And what is its theory of knowledge? 91 C As to the first, the history of the logico-analytic method is part of the history of philosophy, and philosophy has always been part of the class struggle, 91 D Historically, philosophy has been divided between idealism and materialism, 91-2 E Historically, idealism has lent itself to class oppression, 92-3 F Materialism as solvent which weakens this instrument and the class which uses it, 93 G The awkward situation of this class, as dependent on the science which encourages materialism, 93 H Berkeleian philosophy as an effort which helps this bourgeois class out of the contradiction, 93-4 I Wittgen- stein as fulfilling the same historical function, 94 J The logico-analytic method as the most refined example of this philosophical tendency, 95 K Its references of common- sense and scientific statements ultimately to sense data, shows its affinity with other attempts to reconcile the materialist content of science with idealism and mysticism, 95-7 L The distinction between (i) the unanalysed deliverances of scientific discovery and of commonsense, and (ii) the analysis of these, 97-9 M Is this a valid distinction? 99-100 N It is at any rate not recognized for what it is, an epistemological distinction, 100-1 O In giving his analyses, the phenomenological analyst is really working out an epistemo- logical result, 101 P And it is as an epistemological position that the Marxist would challenge this result, 101-2 Q It is the position that man's knowledge is only of what falls within his experience, 102-3 R Against this position it is to be urged that man is not a purely theoretical, but also a social and practical being, 103-4 S The importance of remembering practice in our treatment of the character of human knowledge, 104-6 T In asking for an analysis of a deliverance of science we are seeking in vain, by a purely philosophic activity superimposed on the scientific, to settle the question 'to what do the said deliverances have reference?' 106-7 U The attraction of the method is that the reference found appears to tend to neutralize the materialistic content of science, 107-8 V Are the questions real questions, then, about which the purely philosophic activity busies itself? 108 W It is not a purely philosophic impulse which prompts them, 108-9 X And a purely philosophic activity will not satisfactorily answer them, 110-11 Y Con- clusions, 111-13 Z According to some, analysis purports to yield 'a clearer apprehen- sion of the arrangement of the elements of the fact finally located by' a certain sentence.

Successful operations are 'appropriate', unsuccessful 'inappropriate', to complements, 155-7 C Selective description. Descriptions need not mislead, though simpler than facts, 158-9 D An operation is 'adapted' to an aspect of the environment to which an operation which it resembles is appropriate, 159-60 E Semiotics.

Not facts, not ersatz facts, not neutrality-families of sentences or interpretants, 163-6; G but the supplement of the interpretant of a given sentence, together with the complement of any successful operation which the interpretant sufficiently resembles, 166-7; H i.e. a 'fact-worthy' selection of elements from a real social process of learned linguistic behaviour and its environ- ment, 167-70 CROSS, R.

This theory suggests that ethical sentences function, logically, like descriptive sentences. This leads to the notion of 'seeing' a special kind of non-natural fact, 127-8 B But the emotive theory also has difficulties. It is not clear how, as Mr. Robinson develops the theory, we are to satisfy ourselves that the characteriza- tions of ethical terms offered, are acceptable, 128-31 C Doubts about independent emotive meaning in the examples given, 131-4 D Amongst emotive words, the distinc- tion of ethical words from non-ethical is difficult, and an appeal to introspection unsatisfac- tory, 134-8 E The division of words into descriptive and emotive is much too simple and highly misleading.

Reason, not located in time, is subjective in the act of thought; the principles of reason are what we inevitably imply in advancing from one step to the next in the most detailed statement of a logical argument, 128-9 F Experiences which are located in time are objective in the act of thought. All experience, when reason begins to operate on it, is necessarily in the past, 129-31 G The fundamental elements of experience are individual sense-data. This does not mean that they are inevitably 'given' as sense-data, but that what is given is best so expressed for the purpose of forming it into a rational system, 131-3 H In any portion of the physical world the elements which we cannot escape or modify are the elements of experience; those which we can escape or modify are the elements contributed by reason, 133-6 I This outlook entails no unanswerable questions concerning the 'thing in itself' but identifies the conception of the external world with the scheme of conceptions formed to rationalize experience, 136-9 J Sense-data are more satisfactory units than physical objects for the purpose of forming a comprehensive rational correlation of experiences, 139-41 K 'Conflicts' between science and other studies arise from the fact that the elementary data are differently chosen; there is no ultimate incompatibility, 141-3 L The problems of ethics stand outside scientific treatment, and have no obvious relation to other departments of philosophical study, 143-6 2 The philosophical significance of space-time, Vol. XLVIII (1947-48), pp. 153-64 Synopsis: A Physics and philosophy have a common origin, 153 B The physical concept of space-time is commonly regarded as implying that time is inseparably and uniquely combined with space, 154-5 C It is here suggested that the association is in part voluntary, useful for deriving laws of motion because motion is defined as change of space-position with time, 155-7 D The history of this process briefly outlined 157-60 E It is suggested that this indicates the possibility of a general rule of procedure in physics to obtain the law of a phenomenon; viz., first express the phenomenon as a process occurring in time, then measure time in terms of a standard example of that process, and finally, construct a manifold in which the measure of the process and the measure of time in terms of it are co-ordinates. The geometry of that manifold will then be the law of the pheno- menon. This can be exemplified by the study of temperature radiation, 160-4 DONKIN, E.

Vol. XXXIV (1933-34), pp. 231-48 Synopsis: A This book of Bergson's more hospitable than his former work to certain teleological views, 231-2 B His 'two kinds' of morality and religion correspond to the two types of order-automatic and vital, 232-4 C 'Closed morality' as the con- servative force of a static society, 234 D 'Open morality', as action in the line of the elan vital, shown in the 'love of humanity', 234-5 E 'Love of humanity' is not a mere extension of the loyalties of closed groups, 235-6 F A new way of feeling.

Here it approaches metaphor, 28-9 D Distinction between the inductive use of analogy and the metaphysical, 29-30 E In the latter, a theoretic model is seen underlying a Welt- anschauug, 30 F Illustrations from Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Spinoza, Bradley, Whitehead, McTaggart, 30-3 G Thomist theory of Analogia Entis stated and criticized, 33-8 H Have we such independent knowledge of 'laws of being', as would provide a basis for analogies?

Symposium, Suppl. XX (1946), pp. 198-209 Synopsis: A Philosophical theories which profess to transcend experience have been constructed. The question whether they transcend experience presumably means: What do they achieve if they do? 198-200 B Experience in general, describable as modifica- tion in the conscious state of a subject, result of his acting and being acted upon. This comprises not only responsiveness but interpretation, 200-2 C Metaphysics has some- times been held to consist in theories of that which transcends all possible experience; but it may be concerned with wide interpretative theory resulting in a co-ordinated 'world- view', 202-3 D How this may be made, 203-4 E Illustration: Leibniz' extension of his view of the subject-predicate proposition, first to the notion of the unity of the self, and then, further generalized, to the idea of the monad, 204-5 F Respects in which this (i) opens up fresh possibilities for the interpretation of experience and (ii) leads to apriori solution of outstanding problems, as, e.g. in the pre-established harmony principle 205-7 G Dangers of analogical models of this kind (e.g. one drawn from biological concepts) They may impose concepts appropriate to one range of thought and experience, on others where they are inappropriate, 207-8 H Such metaphysical models, as broad interpretative theories transcending given experience.

Schiller's attack on this, in Logic for Use, summarized, 1-3 B Schiller overlooks points which different valid arguments have in common, 3-4 C An invalid syllogism can only be a good argument where the argument is not really syllo- gistic, 4-5 D Relation of formal logic to psychology, 5 E To deny logical necessity in the sense of logical obligation, would mean absolute scepticism, 5-6 F Formal Logic is not to be blamed because it abstracts from the truth or falsity of premises, 7-8; G nor is it obliged to be satisfied with nothing short of absolute certainty, 8-10 3 A defence of causality, Vol. XXXIII (1932-33), pp. 95-128 Synopsis: A The significance of the issue discussed, 95ff B Difference between the common-sense view of causation and the regularity view, 98ff C Further definition of regularity view, looff D The fact that we cannot define adequately what else there is in causation, does not prove that there is only regularity, 103-4 E The regularity theory and induction, 104ff F Practical action presupposes causation in another sense than regularity. So does memory and inference, 111-13 G Nor if the regularity view were true, could we explain how people ever came to think there was more in causation, 113-14 H Causation in the physical world. Arguments against its being merely regu- larity: (i) It must be presupposed to be more than this if induction is to be valid, 114ff I (ii) Otherwise general laws would be inexplicable coincidences, 116 ff J The arguments against the regularity view are arguments for the view that causation involves logically necessary connexion, 119 ff K This view defended against the objection that we cannot see such a connexion 122ff L A priori insight into causation in the psychological sphere, 124 ff M Activity and necessity, 126-7 N It does not follow from the view here defended that the set of events known as the cause is the whole ground of the effect, 128 4 Mechanical and teleological causation, Symposium, Suppl.

Symposium, Vol. XXXVI (1935-36), pp. 89-96 Synopsis: A The meaning of the opposed statements, discussed by Joad, that there are only minds and that there are only bodies, 89-92 B Interaction not disproved by arguments intended to show the impossibility of causal connexion between two such disparate kinds of thing, 92-5 C Difficulty of holding that we are directly aware of interaction, 95-6 D Interaction need not imply necessarily that body and mind are different substances, and there are other alternative views possible, 96 6 What is action?

Brief reply, 83ff 10 Are mental attributes attributes of the body? Vol. XLV (1944-45), pp. 27-58 Synopsis: A Behaviourism is refuted by the mere empirical observation that e.g. a throb of pain is different from anything the physiologist can observe, 27-30 B Indeed physical and mental attributes as presented are sufficiently different to give some support to Cartesian dualism, yet from the realist point of view it is very plausible to say that mental attributes however different from physical are still attributes of the' body though this need not involve the denial of interaction between them, 31-6 C But if the difference between the two sets of attributes is recognized, this raises the question what is meant by attributing them to the same substance, 37 D Now, if we hold a relational theory of substance, the difficulty arises that, whatever relation we take as constituting the identity of a substance, we shall find that we have to take a different relation in the case of mind from what we take in the case of a physical body, so that it is hard to see what can be meant by calling body and mind the same substance, 38-45; E unless we make this merely a matter of convenience of classification, in which case we shall have to say that in some respects they are the same substance and in others, more important, different substances; and the statement will have no metaphysical implications, 45-8 F If we, however, reject the relational view of substance and make the substance distinct from its attributes, we can have no idea of what the substance is like, and so it is impossible to see how we could be entitled to say that body and mind belonged to the same substance, 48-50 G Nor is it possible either to justify the one-substance theory by an argument from the difficulties raised about causal interaction, or to find an intelligible intermediate view that would make the existential independence of mind impossible, 50-5 H Consequently survival cannot be disproved or rendered improbable by philosophical arguments, 55-8 11 The causal argument for physical objects, Symposium, Suppl.

D. 1 Intention, motive and responsibility, Symposium, Suppl. XIX (1945), pp. 249-66 Synopsis: A In this paper a responsibility is defined as liability to censure, 249-50 B Action is defined as event conditioned by and corresponding to intention, 250-2 C Responsibility attaches to action on account of intention, 252-5 D Definitions of intention and motive, 255-7 E Relations between intention and motive, 257-60 F Responsibility does not attach to intending from a certain motive except indirectly, where a difference in the motive can be taken as indicative of a difference in the intention, 260-3 G Responsibility for motives. It is equally possible to speak of responsibility for intentions as for motives (in the sense of causa rationis) provided we speak of the one or the other, and don't make the one part of the other, 263-6 2* 'Ought' and motivation, Vol. XLVIII (1947-48), pp. 111-38 Synopsis: A When we fail to find a motive sufficient to sustain moral conduct, our error is not, as Prichard would have it, a failure to notice in ourselves the power we have of desiring disinterestedly, 111-14 B A motive is a moving thought-such a thought (of something or other requiring action) as gets us into the necessary action. To say that there is something, the thought of which would (if present) move us to seek it, is different from saying we desire it, 114-18 C Though Prichard does not find the motive where Butler did, his position still implies that morality needs a sanction. For he would convince the man who has a duty, that he has (in considerations additional to those which convince him of the duty) an adequate motive to rise to it, 118-24 D The source of this dilemma (between the need of a sanction for duty, and the need that duty be its own sanction) is in the plurality of ordinary meanings of words like 'ought' and 'duty', 124-8 E But there is one familiar meaning of 'ought' (e.g. 'why ought I to do it?' asked without reference to some act of acknowledged duty) which connects duty necessarily with motivation, 128-30 F Objections to this motivation-meaning of 'ought' considered and answered, 131-6 G Summary, 136-8 FARRELL, B.

XXIII (1949), pp. 31-44 Synopsis: A How the psychologist's discovery of tendencies resembles and differs from a discovery of causes, 30-3 B To transform statements of tendency into statements of law, our method of inquiry must admit of our knowing precisely what would confirm them and what falsify.

Collingwood's version of this position criticized. Art, in Plato, not 'beyond truth and error', but infected with error, 224-31 F Aesthetic experience with its 'psychological anarchy' has its affinities with the anarchy of the tyrant's political rule, and differs from it, for Plato, only in degree, 231-5 G No convincing case for the view that Plato used or developed the theory of art as an autonomous activity beyond truth and error, 235-7 H Summary, 237-8 FIELD, G.

Measures are mainly statistical, 115-17 D (iv) The content of political science should be the structure and processes of all organizations, not merely the state. Structure is mainly a question of size of organiza- tion and their composition into sub-organizations, e.g. committees, 117-20 E (v) There are essentially three political processes; work-sharing selection (and training) of persons for each work-share; and ruling, including the provision of incentives. Every organization has some variety of structure and some variety of work-sharing, selection and ruling process, 120-3 F (vi) Research into rule-sharing is likely to yield important results on the problem (1) How many subordinates one man can efficiently supervise; (2) What powers of rule cannot be delegated to sub-organization and must be reserved for ultimate control, 124-6 G (vii) Summarizing method and content, political science consists of a comparison of the efficiency of alternative combinations of structure and of the process of work-sharing, selection and ruling in every sort of organization for various different transactions, 126-8 FOSTON, H. 1 The mutual symbolism of intelligence and activity, Vol. IX (1908-09), pp. 100-18 FRANKS, 0.

B. I Solipsistic and social theories of meaning, Vol. XXXVIII (1937-38), pp. 61-84 Synopsis: A Three interests distinguished. Those of social psychology, analytic psychology and the general theory of signs, 60-4 B A higher-order question raised. Are the accounts of meaning given by analytic psychology more ultimate than those given by social psychology? 64-6 C The method of analytic psychology. This is introspection, whose data are necessarily private to one thinker; but the meaning of a proposition about such data is not therefore necessarily private to that thinker. The solipsistic theory of mean- ing holds that it is, 66-9 D Statement and criticism of the imagist theory. This takes the function of images in thought as typical of the function of all symbols in thought. It leads to the solipsistic theory of meaning, but it can be refuted empirically, 69-75 E Words as social instruments. Symbols are not simply instruments for recording facts and conveying information. Consideration of negative statements and of questions shows that language is in part an instrument for eliciting assent or disagreement and correction, 75-9 F Public and private. Full justice can be done to the privacy of the data of introspection on the social theory of meaning. Thinking is, however, always a social act in so far as it is aided by language, 79-84 2 The metaphysics of C. S. Peirce, Vol. XLVII (1946-47), pp. 27-62 Synopsis: A Introductory. Peirce's metaphysics prima facie worth serious consideration, 27-9 B His definitions of metaphysics. These are inconsistent; but only one is obviously incompatible with his 'verification' theory of the meaning of empirical proposi- tions, 29-33 C The origin of Peirce's categories. This is to be found in certain peculiar theses of his 'philosophy of logic', 33-6 D Peirce's categorial doctrine (the exposition which here follows is deliberately selective), 36-8 E The first category. The distinc- tion between this and the familiar logical category of quantity is fundamental and is the basis of the author's indeterminism, 38-41 F The second category. This brings out the idiosyncratic element in fact-the 'accidentally actual', 'force without reason or law', 'brute force', 41-4 G The third category. Laws operative in nature are to be under- stood by analogy with the way signs or symbols operate in, or mould, our conduct, 45-8 H Peirce's applications of this categorial doctrine. These may be divided into (i) critical applications, including suggested representations of outstanding problems, and (ii) genetic and constructive applications. His best contributions to metaphysics fall under (i) 49-57 I Conclusion. Attempted re-statement of the function of meta- physics. Critical application of a metaphysics such as Peirce's, while not adding to positive knowledge, can nevertheless make important additions to positive knowledge possible, 57-62 3 Does psychology study mental acts or dispositions? Symposium, Suppl. XXI (1947), pp. 134-53 Synopsis: A The aim here is to show how and what psychologists do study, not how and what they ought to study, 134-5 B What, if anything, is common to the various uses of the word 'act' as it appears in recent psychology? Sketch of a proof that it is used in funidamentally different senses, 135-7 c Does the description of certain mental phenomena (or inferred entities) as acts serve to bring out features of them that are psycho- logically important? Suggestion that it does not, 137-47 D If the acts psychology studies are not studied qua mental or qua acts of mind, why are they of importance to psychology? Suggested restriction of the use of the word 'act' in psychology, 147-8 E If minds are not studied by psychologists in terms of mental acts, how can they be studied at all? In psychological tests acts are never measured or analysed. Capacities, 'sets', com- plexes-in general, dispositions,-are, 148-52 F Conclusion. The view that psy- chology must study 'pin-pointed' mental acts results from taking physical science as the model for psychology. Differences in styles, kinds and degrees of rational behaviour due not to the occurrences of categorically different kinds of act, but to categorically different kinds of disposition, 152-3 1 This paper was read byMr. Ian Gallie's brother at a meetingof the Society at 21, Bedford Square, London, W.C.1. on February 23rd, 1948.

B. 1 The eternal verities and the will of God in the Philosophy of Descartes, Vol. XXX (1929-30), pp. 31-54 Synopsis: A It is Descartes's view that God somehow vindicates science. Science is based on axioms which, though clearly and distinctly conceived, are not their own justifica- tion, 32 B But God's guarantee cannot be automatic, or He would be subject to those very laws which He is supposed to guarantee, 32-3 C On the other hand, it should not be regarded as arbitrary because it does not make sense to appeal from irrational con- fusion to irrational omnipotence, 33-4 D On either of these views, the whole notion of a guarantee is perfectly pointless, 34 E If God's will is bound to His intellect (St. Thomas) or His will is itself assumed to be instinct with intellect (in the main, Descartes), the guarantee makes sense, 35 F Descartes, following the tradition, speaks of God as 'incomprehensible'. In that case the problem should be abandoned. But in Resp. Med. VI he openly asserts the supremacy of God's will over the eternal verities as we know them; and this, though not orthodox, and hence not often emphasized, was his consistent view. It is not quite so arbitrary as it looks, because though God has not necessarily willed the eternal verities, he has willed them to be necessary, 35-7 G On the human plane, omnipotence and perfection both contradict and require each other. In God, no doubt, they might be reconciled. But on the above solution they are not reconciled, for it means that God's will is first absolute and then powerless, 38-40 H The problem could be solved by reference to Boutroux's distinction between absolute and relative contradiction; the contrast between the dissected attributes of will and reason being relative, the contrast between one of them and the whole taken simul et semel as it is in God being absolute; while between the attributes in their context in the divine nature there is no contradiction at all, 40-3 I Descartes, however, does not distinguish between the dependence of the verities on God's mere will, and their dependence on His will and intellect taken inseparably, and thus seems sometimes to be appealing to mere power as a guarantee for 'clear and distinct ideas'. In its latter form, however, the doctrine of the dependence of the verities is vital to Descartes's whole philosophy, 43-6 J Descartes wants a guarantee, because he still thinks of science as requiring a metaphysical sanction. This appears when he seeks for certainty in the cogito over and above the system of 'clear and distinct ideas' which constitutes science. He can get the guarantee from a God whose mind comprises the verities and whose being as a whole transcends them, 47-50 K But science is not thereby reduced to 'appearance'. It is not partially true; it is wholly but conditionally true, 50-1 L If God's intellect were prior to His will, His purposes would include the verities, and final causes would be back in the realm of nature. Only an appeal to the being of God as over and above the verities, can keep them out, 51-2 M Thus science wins independence by submission; it is not dictated to by metaphysics, though it cannot claim to be true of reality until incorporated into a metaphysical system. Sub specie creationis, the verities are first principles; in the being of God, they are merged with His will, and have no independent existence. This is what Descartes requires in order to subordinate science to metaphysics while safeguarding it from interference in detail, 52-4 2 What can philosophy contribute to the study of politics? Symposium, Suppl. XII (1933), pp. 71-85 Synopsis: A As a matter of history there has been a close correlation between conclusions in political theory and conclusions in general philosophy. This is as it should be, 71-2 B Pure rationalism and pure empiricism entail unacceptable consequences in political theory; which is happiest in the company of a sort of teleological dualism, 72 C Monistic rationalists assume the correlation in advance, and are under serious temptation to fit their political theory to their metaphysics. This is in principle impossible because political theory treats of persons and monistic rationalism cannot admit human freedom. The impasse can be postponed, but not avoided, by appeal to a dialectical theory of history, 72-4 D The disrepute of monistic rationalism does not (as is sometimes supposed) put an end to the correlation between political theory and general philosophy. There is the same correlation in the work of anti-rationalist pluralists. It is, however, less certain and less evident (i) because some pluralists have absolute loyalties, (ii) because they are often less interested in philosophy and their philosophical assumptions are concealed, 74-7 E In any case, to philosophize without referring to the political evidence is to philosophize improperly, 77-8 F A wholly mechanistic philosophy would conflict with the presuppositions of politics, 79-80 G Philosophy could not contribute to politics if it were itself a fraud. This is in fact what some 'positivists' have believed. But in fact they supply, without knowing it, uncritical philosophical assumptions of their own, 80-1 H The above rests on certain views about political theory itself: i.e. that it has to consider the terms on which the two pressing demands of spontaneity and co-operation can be combined with- out sacrifice or compromise, 81-2 I It is assumed in this endeavour that the adjust- 064</page><page sequence="69">GINSBERG Gibson, A. B.-continued ment will never be quite perfect, and is controlled by an ideal or end which is always operating in so far as there is a state at all, 82-3 J This is what is meant by 'teleological dualism'; it works in the interpretation of the material of politics; and it might well be confirmed by metaphysical analysis. If so, we have a new correlation on a new basis, and philosophy can contribute to the study of politics, 83-5 GIBSON, W. R.

Symposium, Vol. XVIII (1917-18), pp. 552-81 Synopsis: A To make Bosanquet's (Bradleian) conception of the absolute intelligible, thought must contain immediacy; which requires that thought be taken in a fuller sense than Bradley can give it. Contrast Hegel, 552-60 B Pringle-Pattison's criticism of the 'thought-construction' view of the self, 560-3 C The weakness in his position (as also in Bosanquet's) is that the absolute is really left impenetrable to thought.

But what are 'questions of language'? 31-2 B In ordinary use, a question may be 'partly one of language', implying that it is not wholly one of fact, 32-4 C The issue 'is it a question of language or not?' cannot, as some would mistakenly say, be made to mean 'is the answer an analytic statement or not?' Many questions of language have synthetic answers, 34-6 D The advantage this departure is thought to bring; namely, that clarifications of language will now settle philosophical issues, 36-8 E What, however, the questions answered are about: not the usage of particular expressions in particular languages; rather, about Language (with a capital L), 38-9 F Will it be retorted either that these are not questions at all, or that they demand (i) the rules of use for a constructed language, and (ii) the rules of translation into it? 39-40 G But to say this is to miss the point of the questioner in putting his question, 40-1 H He is looking for some finding on the comparative usefulness of the different kinds of language, 41-2 I Which empirical question is not on that account to be disqualified and taken as an unphilosophical one, 42-6 J Summary, 46-8 HANNAY, A.

Vol. XLVIII (1947-48), pp. 29-36 Synopsis: A In abstract discussions involving the word 'taste' people are disposed to accept relativity; but in discussing particular works of art they use the language of objec- tivity, although they know the psychological processes. This is seen clearly in ordinary criticisms of acting: e.g. of pomposity, 29-30 B The question how we are to know who is right and who wrong has the undisclosed assumption that there can be a test of knowing outside the act of knowing, 30 C First order and second order verification. Science itself always leads back to first order verification, 30 D In pictorial art, criticisms, e.g. of photographic painting will admit of analyses into specific mental processes which can be recognized, 31 E People derive pleasure from different qualities in paintings, some 'artistic' qualities and some not. It is a mistake to identify relativity of pleasure, and of art or of taste. Diversity of opinion about new works of art no proof of relativity. The same diversity can be found, e.g., in science, history, etc. Introspection will show us when we are startled but uncertain, and when we are feeling our way, and when we are confident. 'Controversy' is the road to an objective view, not the proof of relativity. Most people overlook the great degree of agreement about the art of the past. Only historians are interested in the inferior work of the past, 32-3 F Changes of 'attention' are often compared with changes of taste. The former are justifiable. The relativity view has behind it an ideal of automatic perfection, to which research and discovery are foreign, 34 G Confusion between subjective as 'relative' and subjective as 'imaginative'.

XXIII (1949), pp. 165-72 Synopsis: A People always do discuss works of art and their statements are in a reasoned form and more than expressions of feeling, 165 B These discussions are identical with criticism and involve some theory of art, implicit or explicit, 165-6 C The theory pro- vides a framework inside which there is a direct approach variously described, as taste, imagination, intuition, etc., 166-8 D This direct approach can also be discussed and the psychological processes described, e.g. that a novelist's characters are 'laboured', 168-9 E The processes can be designated by general terms-graceful, humorous, sublime-which are useful pointers, 169-70 F Criticism is not epi-phenomenal to 'taste'.

Restatement of his criticism, 134-7 E Examination of Ayer's reply to Stout's criticism, 137-43 F Aaron's reply to Stout evades the point of the criticism, 143-5 G Macnabb claims that his own formulation of phenomenalism 'is not vulnerable to Stout's criticism'.

A. 1 The ascription of responsibility and rights, Vol. XLIX (1948-49), pp. 171-94 Synopsis: A Sentences of the form 'He did it' (like 'This is his' and certain legal sen- tences) have a primary ascriptive, not descriptive, use. In this use they have logical peculiarities (neglect of which has bred a false analysis of 'action') which are best clarified by examination of certain legal concepts, e.g., contract, crime, 171-2 B Many legal concepts cannot be defined by necessary and sufficient conditions, since they are essen- tially defeasible, i.e. explicable only by reference to various heterogeneous defences which may wholly or partly defeat claims and accusations, 172 ff C Theorists have distorted such concepts by treating the defences referring to a mental element as mere negative evidence of an allegedly necessary psychological constituent (mens rea, consent or 'volun- tariness'), 179ff D Facts do not entail logical conclusions, but support them in the specific manner appropriate to defeasible concepts, 181-3 E In ordinary language, technical legal concepts, or concepts derived from legal institutions, e.g. property ('This is his') have various non-descriptive functions, though they are also used descriptively, 183-7 F The concept of an action ('He did it') is fundamentally ascriptive and defeas- ible, though verbs of action have important descriptive uses. Differences between action and physical movement are explicable only by reference to social rules for ascribing responsibility and are distorted by representation as a purely descriptive difference (e.g. occurrence of a psychological event, or 'avoidable') 187-94 G This thesis is not behaviourism, nor does it identify criteria for ascribing responsibility with test for efficacy of punishment and reward, 194 2 Is there knowledge by acquaintance? Suppl. XXIII (1949), pp. 69-90 Synopsis: A 'Knowledge by acquaintance' is the modem form of the traditional conception of knowledge as a simple two-term relation. This has bred, in diverse philosophical systems, both scepticism and metaphysics, 69-71 B Necessary, before answering the title question, to ask what sort of a question it is (i) Contrast 'Is there knowledge by heart?' (ii) Compare 'Are there non-natural qualities?' Question like (ii) uses philosophical technicalities, and accordingly the answer, unlike the answer to (i) cannot be obvious; it needs argument, 71-5 C Yet Russell, Broad, Plato, have asserted, in effect, that affirmative answer to the title question was obvious. They have been led to do this by a radical misconception of philosophical questions concerning knowledge as answerable by a kind of inspection, or descriptive psychology, 75-83 D Examination of the usage of 'know' shows inadequacy of the traditional analysis. Compare the disturbing effect of their analysis as a two-term relation, upon the concepts of knowledge and ownership, 83-6 E Metaphysical 'reasons' for retention of the traditional analysis, 86-8 F Recent (e.g. Ayer's) analysis of knowledge in terms of 'dispositions' defective, yet illuminating.

Symposium, Suppl. XXI (1947), pp. 197-207 Synopsis: A The 'problem of guilt' is not only complicated through ramification (a single fact with many implications) but also through equivocation (one term connoting different facts). The diverse usages of the term must be kept apart, e.g., the forensic (a status incurred by a person) and the psychological (a state of mind occurring in a mental history), 197-9 B For ethics 'guilt' is primarily an attribute of persons (not mental states) but is not (pace Mr. Lewis) to be defined in terms of the special 'blameworthiness' of certain 'wrong' actions, 200-1 C It points rather to the blow which certain (not all) wrong- doing inflicts upon the ethical order, the moral 'fabric of the world' (i.e. the social world). If such expressions have little or no meaning 'guilt' will be given a purely legalistic or psychological or emotive meaning, 200-1 D Whereas if the 'moral order' is taken seriously it will tend to open on to a perspective transcending the merely ethical point of view: i.e., 'guilt' becomes a religious idea-self-alienation from (disloyalty to) an order based on a supra-personal reality, 201 if E On the above interpretation the guilty person is disloyal, a 'bad citizen' of the moral commonwealth. But he is not necessarily the conscious rebel against its law. For tradition attaches special guilt to Pride, and the proud man (i.e. the self-satisfied man) is rather the moral parasite than the moral rebel, 202 F This view also puts punishment in its proper place, and gives a tolerable meaning to the difficult idea of 'corporate guilt', 203-4 G Guilt presupposes responsibility and this, in turn, freedom to act or not to act. Though idealist thinkers have tended too much to identify this presuppositional freedom with the essential freedom of self-determination, the traditional analogies are not open to the criticisms of Lewis, though they cannot elucidate the mystery of free choice, 204-8 HEAD, H.

Here the antithesis of subject knowing and object known is an antithesis in knowledge and is not converted into a duality of existence; knowing is not an object known but a mode of apprehension, and objects are determined by it, 127-32 D The deduction of the categories. Unity of consciousness realizing itself in the objective world, 132-5 E Bewusstsein uberhaupt the source of the moral law as well as of the objectivity of the phenomenal world, 135-8 F The relationship to it of individual minds. Individual mind, as part of the world of experience, has no such priority in knowledge as is claimed for it by Descartes, Locke, and their followers, 138-44 G According to Kant, mental states are 'objects of inner sense', for the transcendental self. But what Kant asserts of the transcendental self is true also of the empirical self; we cannot know mental states as such (as objects, acts, processes, or existents) we can describe them only indirectly by the marks (meanings or contents) of the experiences which they mediate. Bradley's distinction between the 'that' and the 'what' of ideas, 144-50 H How does objective reference come to be conferred on apprehended contents? Psychological analysis, although rejecting Kant's atomistic approach, confirms his main contention that objectivity is the work of thought.

The content as a 'way in which a conscious mind has its experience', 165-7 J The existence of the psychical state which expresses itself even in the most primitive judgment 'something is' (which has, as yet, no objective- or even subjective-reference) is no part of the content, 167-9 K The existence even of feeling is no part of the content apprehended in and through the feeling, 169-72 L The doctrine that whatever is apprehended is objective, criticized, 172-4 M Kant's thing-in-itself as symptom of his (well-founded) hesitation to identify truth with existence, as subsequent idealism has done, 175-8 6 Sense-presentation and thought, Vol. VI (1905-06), pp. 271-346 Synopsis: A The preamble, 271-3 B Sense presentation in rudimentary form.

It is developed from a more rudimentary experience in which it was not present; this being, however, of the nature of an apprehending activity, not a passive state of feeling, 174-88 D The resultant problem for a psychology of cognition, namely, to give an account of how the subject-object distinction, familiar to the mature consciousness, arose.

Presentation must not be divorced from thought, 252-8 H The progressive discrimination characteristic of advancing knowledge is the developing content of the act of knowing and is distinct from its object, 258-62 I This content of the act corresponds to 'appearance', and its object to 'reality', in the current antithesis of 'appear- ance and reality', 262-4 J Appearances (contents of the act of apprehending or know- ing) though they are 'constructions', need yet neither be mental entities nor physical, 264-5 K Why Mr. Moore's sense data cannot be either non-mental or mental, 265-8 L The formula: 'From the "activity of consciousness" to the "consciousness of activity" '.

Presented sensations would be lived- through: i.e. would have such a relation to me that, to be out of it, would, for them, be to be out of existence, 435-7 C But is a sensum a continuant, as, presumably, an act of apprehension is, and as a sense-quality is? 437-42 D Cognitive acts exhibit qualita- tive differences as acts, 438ff. 15 The 'modes' of Spinoza and the 'monads' of Leibniz, Vol. XVIII (1917-18), pp. 329-62 Synopsis: A Prefatory, 329-32 B Aristotle's two incompatible positions about sub- stance, 332-4 C Spinoza's difficulties.

Symposium, Suppl. II (1919), pp. 159-78 Synopsis: A Russell's antithesis 'acquaintance v. description' is the traditional one between sense and thought except (i) that his distinction is not between passive and active, and (ii) that we can be acquainted not only with sensa, but with introspecta, with memories and with universals, 159-60 B B. A. W. Russell intends precisely what J. Grote, in dis- tinguishing 'acquaintance with' from 'knowledge about', warns us against, namely, identifying acquaintance with the sort of immediateness in which knowledge has not yet begun. This leaves the emergence of judgment a mystery, 160-7 C The other perplexities to which it gives rise: acquaintance with (i) such data as are only to be reached by analytical observation; (ii) complex data, (iii) universals; (iv) any object that is open only to discriminative apprehension, 167-71 D The presumed infallibility of acquain- tance. Must its object be what I am conscious of it as being?

Symposium, Suppl. III (1923), pp. 123-28 Synopsis: A On whether the characters of particular things are particular, both Stout's view and Moore's seem logically possible, 123-5; B but if Stout is right he must be able to show how a particular can have 'a' character, and not a multitude of them, 125 C How, moreover, does his 'distributive unity of a class or kind' escape the difficulties of nominalism? 125-8 20 The dynamic aspect of nature, Vol. XXV (1924-25), pp. 77-106 Synopsis: A 'Force' or 'energy' always something before consciousness, not anything in the mental life itself, 77-87 B Is what we are thus conscious of a veritable con- stituent of physical reality? 87-90 C Just as 'the nature which is the fact apprehended in awareness' holds within it 'the green of the trees, the song of the birds', so it holds also what we are aware of as force, activity, strain, stress, tension, 90-6 D Witness, e.g. the newer knowledge of the atom, 96-102 E Does the general theory of relativity extinguish the dynamic in nature? 102-6 21 In Memoriam; 3'ames Ward, Vol. XXV (1924-25), pp. 336-40 080</page><page sequence="85">HICKS Hicks, G.

Some problems upon which the phenomenological facts might bear, viz. (i) The indicative sign. Is it not always also expressive? (ii) The value of action as expression.

E. Taylor's two inconsistent positions anent Anselm's ontological argument, 20-23 C The phrase 'the meaning of'. Meaning must always have some material content, 23-4 D For Anselm's 'fool', he not having fides (i.e. religious experience) the meaning 'God' has presumably no material content; and thus, for him, it cannot be said to include existence, 24-6 E The principle here illustrated: valid reasoning is not a question only of the structure of the object we are thinking about, but also of what we are thinking with, 26-9 F The generalized ontological argument: preamble, 29-30 G The statement that the totality of being must exist-that its essence involves existence-cannot be let become a tautology, 30-2 H Recognizing the principle as our most elementary experience, we should develop it genetically, thereby keeping our thoughts real. Some consequences of such a method of thinking, 32-6; I whether there is anything whose non-existence is unthinkable, depending on the nature of the thinking, 36-8 HOLLOWAY, J. 1 Ethical qualities, Vol. LXVIII (1947-48), pp. 13-28 Synopsis: A The real significance of any ethical theory lies in the contrasts it makes between statements of various kinds, e.g., about goodness, and about greenness or pleasant- ness, 13-15 B The prima facie case for subjectivism is that in some respects the word 'good' is undeniably more analogous in its use to 'nice' than to, say, 'green', 15-16 C Objectivists, however, insist that there is no close analogy between 'this is good' and 'this is approved'. Here they are wrong. The connexion is always very intimate (unless good' is being used without ethical significance). But it takes many forms, and must be traced sometimes in one way, sometimes in another. Examples supposed to stress the differences between the two expressions seem convincing only because they confuse these forms, 16-23 D But 'to approve' does contrast with 'to like'; the more so according as it is associated more closely with 'good', 23-5 E Neither theory has any particular implication for practical morality. But each is derived from one of the two main theories of meaning-'subjectivism' from nominalism, and 'objectivism' from concep- tualism or realism. Neither side has yet shown in detail how ethical words (or qualities) differ in usage (or status) from others, 25-8 2 What are the distinctive features of arguments used in art criticism? Suppl. XXIII (1949), pp. 173-82 Synopsis: A Since works of art are sometimes esoteric or baffling, the first task of the critic is to draw attention to the details of the work that is his subject, 173; B which he may do in a variety of ways, not necessarily by plain description, 173-5 C This pre- liminary description, though the basis of final evaluation, is not related to it as logical premiss to conclusion; and, strictly, the critic does not use arguments at all, 175-6 D Canons of criticism are often enough, at first, generalizations about what features of works of art we usually favour (see Aristotle's Poetics); acquiring normative force, as the means to an end often comes to be valued as itself the end, 176-80 E But an artist may always achieve success actually through flouting a canon; this can be avoided only by making canons useless truisms, 180-1 F Therefore not even canons can function as premisses in logical argument; and their main use is to modify the observer's sensibility or direct his attention, 181-2 HUGHES, G. E. I The ethical relevance of consequences, Vol. XLVIII (1947-48), pp. 59-74 Synopsis: A The distinction between ground and content of duty, 59-60 B An ambiguity in utilitarianism. Utilitarianism as a theory of the ground of duty dismissed, 60-2 C Are the consequences of our actions included in the content of our duty? 62-72 D The ground of a duty usually prescribes, as its (the duty's) content, an end to be achieved, and only indirectly an action; though it must prescribe some action, directly or indirectly, 62-4 E Criticism of arguments that actions alone are contents of duties, 64-8 F Relevance of agent's beliefs to the content of his duty, 68-9 G Outline of main positions maintained.

Hart supposes, 91-3 B Criticisms of Hart's distinction between philosophical and descriptive uses of 'knowledge by acquaintance', 93-5 C Philosophers often introduce technical terms for reasons other than those of which Hart complains. This applies to Moore's and (according to Moore) to Russell's use of acquaintance, 95-8 D Propositions, not facts, are diadic, triadic, etc.; but the dispute about whether a diadic or a triadic proposition is to be used may indicate a disagreement about facts, 98-100 E Discussion of the controversy between idealists and 'acquaintance-theorists' (Moore, Russell, Broad, etc.). The latter right that there can be sensory awareness without asser- tion, but wrong if they called such awareness knowledge, 100-6 F What is right and what is missing in the recent dispositional analysis of knowing.

H. 1 On semantics and physics, Vol. XLIX (1948-49), pp. 115-32 Synopsis: A A physical theory consists of a formal calculus and of an interpretation in terms of experience. The calculus is in the object language and the interpretation is given by a known meta-language, 115-16 B The construction of an artificial language- system enables us to state more precise rules of meaning for our sentences, 116-19 C Carnap's terminology of semantics is adopted for purposes of this discussion, 119-20 D Actual physical theories are not formalized. Their interpretation is often given by a model, 120-3 E The model is sometimes a picture. It implicitly prescribes semantic rules for the usage of the concepts, 123-5 F The abstract theories of modem physics are related, through the correspondence principle of Bohr, to classical physics, 125-6 G The asymptotic agreement of formulae shows that we have semantically-true interpre- tations of the two calculi, 126-8 H The semantic type of a language is given by the principal descriptive sign, that is, the main concept, 128-9 I Formalization of a lan- guage is required, to avoid semantic paradoxes. Natural language is not formalized. It is semantically closed, as was shown by Tarski, 129-32 J When we analyse ordinary language, we cannot but apply the semantic method. From the analysis of scientific language we can learn how the rules of language give the meaning of our sentence, 132 INGE, W.

For the Platonist, we find our immortality in that world of eternal values, which is the real, 272-4 C As having laid hold of this eternal life and been freed of bondage to time and place, the soul is the Platonic 'higher soul' and is immortal, 274-7 D Immortality, versus survival in the sense of endless continuation of the life of time.

We must take it as our point of contact with supra-temporal existence. Immediacy as supra-temporal, 5-6 D If they be properly understood, we may still have scientific causation on those terms, 6-8 E Nor is anything endangered by them, which we want to believe, about freedom, values, change, succession, the soul, teleology.

Unless we are to quarrel with the question, we must so interpret 'synthetic' as to make neither 'synthetic a priori' self-contradictory nor 'synthetic truth' pleonastic, 141ff B A priori. Applied to truth, 'a priori' means 'knowable without appeal to experience'. It does not mean 'intuitable or thence demonstrable'. But intuition, and demonstration from intuited premisses, are the only ways of knowing without appeal to experience, 144ff C A priori. If interpreted as the formal contradictory of 'a posteriori', it would be applicable to unknowable truth, 147f D Intuitable, v. a priori demonstrable.

The principle of causality, as usually stated, expresses a wish for exactness, which is always frustrated, and cannot be used in practice, 61-4 B The practical scientific method is one of successive approximation. A quantitative criterion for the acceptance of a law as it stands, or for a suggested modification, can be stated in terms of the theory of probability. At the outset all variation is considered at random, and modifications expressing parts of it in calculable form are considered in turn, 64-8 C When a set of properties are found so generally associated that we can infer their probable association as a general rule, it becomes worth while to form a concept of a thing with this set of properties and to give it a name.

Our perceptions may be in us, for the realist, the percepts being out there.

XIX (1945), pp. 151-64 Synopsis: A The verification and justification of empirical statements. Mr. MacKinnon's questions are concerned with the latter, rather than with verification in the proper sense, 151-2 B Verifiability principle. What was the original intention of the epigram that the meaning of a statement is the method of its verification? 152-5 C Two versions of Kant's doctrine about the a priori, involved in Mr. MacKinnon's questions. Evidence for both to be found in Kant, but the difference not realized by him, 155-9 D Is there any sentence-form which must appear, in any language which is suitable for the statement of empirical facts? 159 E Suggestion that the subject-predicate form is thus indis- pensable.

'Necessary' ordinarily means the same as 'inevitable'; but when we say that something is established by convention we mean that it is not inevitable, 118-19 B Mr. Britton's view about rules of inference. The real nature of linguistic rules. It is a platitude that linguistic rules are convendonal in a large sense of the term. To say that propositions (as distinct from sets of sounds or marks) are true by convention (i.e. could be made untrue by a change of linguistic rules) is absurd, 119-22 C Mr. Urmson's attempt to give examples of alternatives to necessary truths.

On the other hand there is a (distinctive) general use of the term, 209-12 E The use of 'good' in aesthetic judgments is a specific use. The relation of 'good' to criterion characters, in aesthetic criticism, shows this, 212-13 F e.g., Reynolds, Beren- son, Fry, Delacroix, 213-14 G Grounds assigned for altering a judgment in aesthetics also illustrate the point, 215-16 H 'Good' does not stand for an indefinable quality though it may be indefinable.

These are 'copies' (in the main) of sense presentations but are not images of them unless they also represent or indicate them, 252-3 E Notions as well as images are said to be 'of' things: but not other such 'signs' as, e.g., words. We do not call a word an 'idea of', 253-5 F This analysis is consistent with the view that notions and images are selec- tions from fact, which indicate much that they do not show. Hence talk about 'ideas' as 'contents' and as 'vehicles', 255-8 G Images and notions therefore may be objects which confront the mind and yet be 'of' an object which may confront the mind in the selection of sense-presentation or sense-other, 258-9 H This is opposed to the dialectic view that all ideas are psychical processes with objective reference, a view applying both to presentative and to representative ideas and denying the possibility of any confronting of the mind with fact, 260 I Unreasonable to hold that presentative confronting applies to vision only. It applies to all the senses, 261-3 J Difference between this analysis and e.g. Mr. Santayana's, 263-6 4 The mutual relations between ethics and theology, Symposium, Suppl.

VIII (1928), pp. 203-13 Synopsis: A Distinction between aestheta, noeta and epidoxasta, 203 B Epidoxasta imply aestheta. Does self-acquaintance require private aestheta and can such perform mental functions? 203-5 C The aestheta called by Ward 'attention' and 'feeling' might conceivably do so, 205-6 D Despite possible objections, these do exist, 206-7 E But a self is not an aestheton and in this terminology must be one epidoxaston, 207-9 F The constructional, the inferential, the ampliative and the occasional theory of the relation of epidoxasta to aestheta, 209-10 G The main question is whether (i) we may validly or (ii) must infer a metaesthetic ego, 210 H Those alleged proofs of a metaes- thetic ego which rest on the insufficiency of Hume's 'bundle' theory, on 'ownership', and on 'substance', are mistaken, 210-12 I The most serious objection is that introspectible ego-aestheta could not perform mental functions. A continuum of actual and possible aestheta might, however, do so; and this ampliative view, without inferring a metaesthetic ego, should suffice, 212-13 6 Realism and modern physics, Symposium, Suppl.

Universal reason is our very selves, 22-6 H Is our own activity lucidly obvious to us? 26-8 I May it not be the ordering principle that we understand, not the ordered result? 28-9 J The doctrine that logical connexion is reference to an object and objectivity itself, is untenable, 29-30 8 Actuality and value, Symposium, Suppl.

The "case' Taylor says he has to meet, 81-3 B In many of his arguments, both actuality and value are regarded as connected predicates (which seems to be an error).

Symposium, Suppl. XIV (1935), pp. 206-13 Synopsis: A Theology asserts that the universe is rational, righteous and holy. While its rational or nomic character and its righteousness might sustain scientific proof, it is doubtful whether there could be a science of its holiness, 206-8 B An 'empirical science' of theology may not be impossible though most such theologies have to be content with rather vague indications, 208-10 C In the ontological cosmological and other such arguments, an attempt was made to construct a rational science of theology, but without much success, 210-12 D In particular the holiness of the All was not proved by such arguments, 212 E Neither empirical nor notional ethico-theology has been successful nor has epistemo- logically-based theology, even if epistemology were a 'science', 212-13 11 Memory-knowledge, Symposium, Suppl.

From 'I am imagining this now' can we infer 'this image is now existing'? 36-8 D Can a memory-datum be identical in whole or in part with an earlier sense-datum?

Our question is whether anything, being intrinsically good, is absolutely so, 115-16 C If all goods are contextually good there is no intrinsic good short of the whole, 116-17 D Discussions of intrinsic good usually describe such a good as a personal possession thus neglecting relational or inter-personal goods, 117-18 E Also an intrinsic good might be very feeble although intrinsic and good, 118 F The summum bonum for Aristotle. Did his arguments show that man had just one utmost end? 118-20 G Did they show that there was a complete and self-sufficient good? 120-1 H A certain unity in what is good is the most that can be shown, 121 I An atheist need not deny the existence of absolute good, 121 J There is some interest in discussing absolute evil and a summum malum, 122-3 13 Posititism, empiricism and metaphysics, Vol. XXXIX (1938-39), pp. 207-24 Synopsis: A Positivism is the doctrine that there is no knowledge outside the sciences.

If so, various decrepit dependents-images, dreams, etc.-do actually exist nevertheless, 212-14 E For the most part robust empiricists rely on 'sense-data', forgetting that a selective critical process is presupposed, e.g. in denying that hallucinations are sense-data (or reputable sense-data?), 214-15 F An empiricist should be a positivist (if 'robust') only if he holds that everything in every science can be reduced to sense-data, 216-17 G A positivist would be an empiricist if he could reduce scientific knowledge to sense-experience. Commonly nowadays he 'stipulates' this by an act of faith, 217-18 H Metaphysics is the science of ultimates, 218 I Robust empiricists, holding as they do that sense-data are ultimates and the only ultimates, are very arrant metaphysicians in consequence, 218-19 J Positivists are also metaphysicians if they take science to be ultimate. Sometimes they are agnostic on this point. But unless they can give a non-provisional reason for being only provisional, their doctrine is suspect, 219-20 K What they seem to attack is 'metaphysical things', an unnecessary superstition, 220-4 14 The present-day relevance of Hume's 'Dialogues concerning natural religion', Symposium, Suppl. XVIII (1939), pp. 206-17 Synopsis: A Incorrect to say that Hume was Cleanthes or was Philo in the Dialogues, 206-7 B The main question is whether, as Cleanthes held, the experimental method does strongly support theism or whether, as for Philo, a narrower positivism is all that is supported by the method, 207-9 C A dialogue concerning experimental deism, 209-11 D Regarding theism, natural theology, understood as the experimental method, supports divine intelligence much more strongly than divine morality, 211-13 E Positivism, denying the application of scientific experiment to the whole, does not receive Hume's unqualified support, 213-14 F Hume's assertion of 'naturalism' is doubtful, 214-15 G Plan of the argument to a designer in the Dialogues, 215-16 H Unhistorical to hold that scepticism regarding experimental theism, combined with acceptance of experimental deism, is a way of pooh-poohing theology, 216-17 15 Hobbes on Aristotle's Politics, Vol. XLIII (1942-43), pp. 1-20 Synopsis: A Hobbes' objection to 'Aristotelity', political and other, 1-2 B Hobbes' theory was not a modification of Aristotelianism, 2-4 C He tried to found a new demonstrative science of Natural Justice, 4-5 D In a measure this developed the classical 'either a wild beast or a God', i.e. homo homini lupus (in a state of nature) and homo homini deus (in the civil state), 5-7 E But, as against Aristotle, man's political capacity was due to the rational desire of government, not to his being political by nature, and it abjured 'natural slavery' and natural kingship. The artifice of sovereignty made the body politic, 7-12 F For Hobbes it was men, not laws, that ruled, 12-15 G For Hobbes the body politic was constituted by its government. He believed that Aristotle confused between the freedom of the ruler and the personal liberty of the subject, between kingship and tyranny, between selfish and public-spirited government, 15-18 H Some minor points mentioned, 18-19 I And some general, even modish, questions, 19-20 16 Can philosophical theories transcend experience? Symposium, Suppl. XX (1946), pp. 228-32 Synopsis: A Can it be shown that human cognition, which ostensibly transcends experience, does not genuinely do so? 228-9 B But all cognition is not demonstrably reflexive, 229-30 C We do not experience only experiences, 230-1 D In the absence of demonstration to the contrary, the initial epistemological presumptions must stand, 231-2 LAMONT, W. D. I On the 'moral' argument for God's existence, Vol. XXXI (1930-31), pp. 103-26 Synopsis: A Some 'moral arguments' for the existence of God are not only ineffective for their purpose, but also tend to confuse issues in moral theory. Examples are the arguments of Martineau and Green, 103-4 B Martineau holds that moral duty implies a person imposing the duty on the person owing the duty, and that for moral duty the imposer must be a perfect being, 105 C While agreeing that duty implies an ower of duty, an owner of the correlative right, and a legislator imposing the duty, must we hold that the legislator is necessarily a person other than the ower or the owner? 106-7 D Martineau holds that owner and legislator are the same person, but that ower and legislator are necessarily distinct, 107 E This would mean that mora Iduty is necessarily externally imposed; but Martineau himself uses arguments implying a self-imposed inward standard by which all external commands are judged, 107-9 F This standard is in fact a principle, native to the human mind, for the equitable adjustment of claims and counter- claims, 109-10 G And it is the supreme standard of moral judgment even on 0103</page><page sequence="108">LANGLEY Lamont, W. D.-continued the assumption that a perfect being exists, 110-12 H Martineau's 'moral argument', therefore, breaks down; for it held that the conception of a perfect being is necessarily implied in the conception of duty, 112-13 I This is the authoritarian theory of morality which does not correspond to moral experience, 113-15 J Green holds that human 'potentialities' imply the existence of a being in whom those potentialities are eternally realized, 115-16 K This argument is based on a general view of what is necessarily implied in a process of development, 116-17 L But it involves a confusion between the questions: What is implied in development? and, What is implied in our awareness of the potentialities of a developing process? 118 M It is true that such awareness implies an idea of the end-term in the process, and this may involve that a state like this end-term has existed in the past; but it does not imply the present- much less the eternal-existence of this state, 118-19 N But for development (as distinguished from awareness of the potentialities of development) the existence of the end-term as eternal, or as present, or as past, is not implied, 119-22 0 Rejecting Martineau's and Green's doctrines, we may assess the place of authority in morals by distinguishing two questions: the nature of the moral standard; and the origin of particular moral concepts, 123-4 P The nature of the inward standard is expressed in acts of universal legislation by the 'ower' of duty; while the origin and develop- ment of particular moral concepts lies in initial acceptance on 'authority', and subsequent critical reflection under the guidance of the principle of universality, 124-6 2 Can philosophy determine what is ethically or socially valuable? Symposium, Suppl. XV (1936), pp. 219-35 Synopsis: A Professor Stocks and Mr. Stout agree that philosophy has the same relation to value as to truth; but disagree about the nature of the relation. Their common assump- tion is, however, open to challenge, 219-20 B Relation of philosophy to theoretical belief: beliefs or judgments can be regarded as facts (when we investigate their causes) or as theories (when we investigate their truth); and a theoretical inquiry on a given subject, since it always aims at truth, will treat as theories all judgments about the subject in question, 220-1 C Therefore philosophy, aiming at insight into the nature of reality, wil be concerned to assess the truth about all judgments regarding the nature of reality. Mr. Stout is therefore right-as against Professor Stocks-in holding that philosophy is concerned to determine truth, 222 D Relation of philosophy to value: But Professor Stocks is right-as against Mr. Stout-in holding that philosophy does not determine what is good, since philosophy, as a theoretical inquiry, is concerned with what is, and not with what ought to be, 222 E Mr. Stout's view appears to neglect the subjective factor in valuation, 223 F Philosophy can, like any other theoretical inquiry, indicate instru- mental goods; but it cannot determine what is good for us independently of our actual interests and valuations; for valuations (unlike beliefs) are essentially conative, 224-5 G Criticism of assumption that philosophy related in same way to truth and to value. Mr. Stout's view would accord with an objective theory of value; but it may result from not distinguishing the philosopher qua philosopher from the philosopher qua practical man In the latter capacity he will, naturally, make value judgments, 226-7 H Professor Stocks, on the other hand, appears to use the term 'philosophy' ambiguously as (i) dialectic and (ii) science of valuations, 228 I As (i) he takes it to be restricted to the criticism and correlation of theories, the direct contact with facts being the work of sciences; and as (ii) he regards it as understanding rather than criticizing and correcting valuations, 229-30 J Hence, since philosophy in sense (i) is to truth of fact as philosophy in sense (ii) is to practical valuations, the ambiguous use of 'philosophy' produces the conclusion that philosophy is concerned to determine neither truth nor value, 230-1 K But, avoiding this ambiguity, and using 'philosophy' consistently in sense (i) it may be argued that philosophy is a co-partner with science in determining truth without holding that it determines value, 231-2 L Influence of theory on practice: Both philosophy and the social and natural sciences influence (rather than determine) valuations by altering belief about the objective relations between things; for, when qua theorist I get new insight, then qua practical man I make detailed revaluations, 232 M But this readjustment always presupposes a personal, relatively permanent, scheme of main values in subordination to which the detailed revaluations occur, 233 N Philosophy is most influential in this readjustment by concentrating on questions of truth, since we only influence practical valuation indirectly by altering men's beliefs-the beliefs which they individually see to be relevant to their existing schemes of values, 234-5 LANGLEY, G.

The 'kingdom' whose service is freedom must contain all rational beings, as ends, and not only some, 43-5 D (II) Corporate state. The corporate state's will is a transcendent 'general will' which the 'leader' authoritatively 'intuits', as underlying the citizens' wills, 45-6 E The leader therefore claims the right to assert the corporate will (i) by force, or (ii) by modifying existing institutions, 46-7 F The way in which the corporate state may give a certain freedom, 47-8 G Inherent limitations of the general will (aim) of any State. Hence the absolute right claimed by the leader to impose such will subversive of true freedom, 48-50 H (III) Communism. It begins as an attempt to liberate individuals, 50-2 I Limitations: Leaders compelled to adopt both authoritarian imposition of dogma, and propagation of its aims by force. Hence failure to provide conditions of freedom, 52-5 J (IV) Democracy. In principle democracy seems to imply that all men are equal, and that man is more than merely a citizen, 55-7 K Contemporary conditions which limit realization of this ideal, 57-9 L Corporate States and Communism. In different ways, these are reactions against a conflict of ends assumed to be inherent in existing democratic states, 59-60 3 Reason, Vol. XXXIX (1938-39), pp. 85-98 Synopsis: A Rational activity as adaptation of conscious selves to their environment, 85-7 B How this adaptation is maintained.

The assumption implied, when it is said that the same result always emerges from the same experiment.

The mechanical change which had merely been deepening some quality has given place to a 'dialectical' change which does away with the quality 101-3 L How far are these changes predictable, or how far does determinism characterize them? 104 M In 'dialectical' change (as is seen in the physical examples) prediction is in terms of the secondary or internal cause, 104 N Application of these principles in the social sphere. When an external cause operating on a social group generates internal agitation preparatory to a (dialectical) change of phase in the group prediction should be possible, of (i) how the internal cause will modify the group-components, and (ii) when conditions will be ripe for the dialectical change to come, 104-6 LEWIS, H.

Symposium, Suppl. XX (1946), pp. 30-39 Synopsis: A The first symposiast (Professor Ryle) distinguished two senses in which the principles of logic can be said to be applied; and Part I of the present paper is concerned with a critical discussion of Mr. Ryle's distinction, 30-1 B It is argued that Mr. Ryle's account of the first of these two senses is unsatisfactory, and it is suggested that a better explanation can be given by saying that a proposition P, is an application (in the sense in question) of a logical principle, Q, if and only if P is a value of the propositional function, the truth of all values of which, is asserted by Q, 30-2 C It is argued that Mr. Ryle's explanation of the second of these two senses is also unsatisfactory. Mr. Ryle said that the inference 'To-morrow is not Tuesday, therefore to-day is not Monday' is in accordance with the logical principle 'if p implies q, then not-q implies not-p'. This principle is modi- fied to run: 'For all p and q, if "if p then q", then "if not-q then not-p" ', and is called the principle R; and it is claimed that the reference in question is not in accordance with R, 32-3 D It is suggested here that in order that a particular inference, E, should be in accordance with a particular logical principle, P, it is both necessary and sufficient that E should be of a form which is related to P in the way in which the form 'p or q, therefore q or p' is related to the principle 'For all p and q, if p or q then q or p', 33-4 E It is stressed that the principles of logic are applied (in the second sense distinguished in Part I) in deriving em- pirical conclusions from empirical premisses; and it is asked whether any meaning can he attached to the supposition that had our experiments been different from what they actually are, we might have applied different logical principles, 34-5 F The Author takes as an example the principle 'For all p, if not not-p then p', and considers what can be meant by supposing that in certain circumstances we may cease to apply this principle in making inferences, 35-6 G It is argued here that it is impossible to regard an in- ference which is in accordance with this principle as invalid, and yet retain our present concept of 'proposition', but it is claimed that in certain circumstances we might change our concept of 'proposition' and construct a logical calculus in which the principle in question does not hold, 36-9 LINDEMANN, F.

Here, we must rely on perception, 78-80 C The dependence of it upon perception is the point, when the understanding's knowledge is confined by Kant to the phenomenal, 80-4 D Any difficulties of Kant's view arise from the nature (as he conceives it) of the perception to which he has confined the understanding's knowledge, 84-5 E Kant hold$ that the general causal principle, though a priori valid, permits particular causal laws to be empiric- ally discovered. Evidence that this is his position is to be found in the Analogies, 85-7 F In Kant's account of causation in the Analogies, and in his account elsewhere of the general principle in relation to particular causal laws, we find that, for him, confine- ment of the understanding's knowledge to the phenomenal is its necessary dependence on perception, 87-91 G In the light of this, it also becomes intelligible that he should treat the principles of mechanism and teleology as 'regulative', 91-2 2 Purpose and mechanism, Symposium, Vol. XII (1911-12), pp. 231-43 Synopsis: A Is this distinction more than methodological?

But nature herself individuates. In dealing with her own relatively 'closed' systems we are not merely criticizing categories, 233-5 C Inadequacies of the Cartesian way of treating these.

Thus only could there be determinateness in the command which is law, 238-40 C Here the source of the determinateness is in the authority whether this be one person or many or even all that are in the country, 240-2 D Criticism, 242-3 E Why the authority for a law cannot be they who utter, or he who utters it. The modem state. Inconsistencies in its development. Its inadequate language of sovereignty, 243-5 F If the state's sovereignty is simply to be denied, what of the element of force which it (undoubtedly) has at call? 245-8 G The true sovereign in the modem constitutional state. The sovereignty is that which appears in the federal state namely the sovereignty of the constitution, 248-51 H Criticism of the so-called sovereignty of the 'general will'-Bosanquet, etc. What this last writer is really saying, 251-4 5 What does the mind construct? Vol. XXV (1924-25), pp. 1-18 Synopsis: A The difficulty of philosophers in avoiding the position that the knowing process interferes with its objects; how it arises, 1-4 B The hypothesis here proposed that the 'mental' constructing involved in knowing is just a piece of ordinary construct- ing, undertaken for a purpose, namely knowing, 4-5 C What is constructed is one thing, what is known thereby is another, 5 D The construct. (i) What, with its help, we want to understand, (ii) how we are able to make it, and (iii) how we apprehend it, 6-7 E The construct a tertium quid, but not one having an existence intermediate between the knower and his object, 7-8 F Mental construction and the reality it helps us to know. The sense of 'mental', 8-11 G The products of constructive imagination are in no way specially 'mental'. Changes imagined and changes perceived are changes respectively due to us and not due to us, in one and the same series of data, 11-16 H Images are thus constructions of the same kind as maps or models or words, 16-18 6 The economic doctrine of the concept, Symposium, Suppl.

(Baron Lindsay of Birker)-continued 7 The mutual relations between ethics and theology, Symposium, Suppl. VII (1927), pp. 143-52 Synopsis: A The topic: ethics and theology, not religion and ethics, 143-5 B The Catholic divorce between reason and faith (i) in ethics, (ii) in theology; ethics becoming either natural or revealed, and theology either natural or dogmatic, 145-6 C The new development marked by the Reformation doctrine of law and grace, 146-7 D How is this Pauline (theological) doctrine about the facts of conduct related to the Kantian (ethical) doctrine about them? 147-8 E For the two are dealing (however differently) with the same facts, 148 F The theological deals with the faith or inspiration which these facts imply, 148-50 G And, secondly, with the personal pattem, concrete and perfect, which they are the result of an effort to imitate, 150-1 H Why St. Paul's reflections on these facts of conduct or practice give rise to a theology, and not, like Kant's to an ethics. They assume that religious experience, though practical, is also a source of ultimate truth, 151-2 8 Bosanquet's theory of the general will, Symposium, Suppl. VIII (1928), pp. 31-44 Synopsis: A The confusion which makes Bosanquet think he wants an opposite view of sovereignty to Austin's-as though Austin had been asking (about positive law) how it can be authoritative, and not whence its determinateness, 31-2 B How Hobbes an- swered the two questions, 33-4 C Rousseau's answer. What articulates itself in the body of law is the general will and the law has authority as being such articulation. But this implies that the general will is the will of all-which Bosanquet would say (and which he would have Rousseau say) it is not. Criticism, 34-7 D Rousseau's general will refers (i) to the capacity, in the moral being, of willing what is general, and (ii) to the mind of a social group having an inherent life, 37-9 E The latter, however, cannot be a person with a will; and cannot be the sovereign. The amendment the theory calls for, 39-41 F But the general will, for Rousseau and for Bosanquet, is also (iii) the will of the Demos, 41-2; G which is more feasible for Rousseau (with his small state) than for Bosanquet, 42-4 LINDSAY, J. 1 Italian philosophy in the nineteenth century, with special reference to the place of Francesco Donatelli, Vol. I (1900-01), pp. 128-39 2 Alleged contradictions in the concept of relation-a criticism of Mr. Bradley's 'Appearance and reality', by G.

This is only verbally circular, 195 6 B The methods required for the analysis of aesthetic experience are psychological, objective (Kunstwissenschaft), genetic, and axiological. They have not been applied as thoroughly in this country as in Germany, 196-8 C Contemporary psycho- logical aesthetics vitiated by the ambiguities of Croce's expressionism, but some interesting distinctions between aesthetic and non-aesthetic mental states are established by 'aesthetic fusion' (L. A. Reid) 'psychic distance' (E. Bullough) and 'aesthetic sympathy' (Vernon Lee, G. Scott), 198-200 D The objective study of art has been carried forward by critics such as Roger Fry, Clive Bell and B. Berenson in the case of painting and sculpture; architecture has been analysed by Blomfield, Reilly and G. Scott; music by Hadow and Vernon Lee; poetry and literature by Lascelles Abercrombie, A. E.

Force as includin (iii) speed (directly perceived) and (iv) duration (suggested by fatigue), 58-9 B Thie secondary abstractions based on these, namely space, time and matter, 59-61 C Use of the terms 'force', 'energy', 'work', 61-2 D Devices for dispensing with the ether of space.

O.* 1 Intuitionalism, Vol. XIV (1913-14), pp. 126-51 Synopsis: A Physical facts do not become my mental states by being contents of my consciousness. Anything is a content of my consciousness when I become aware of it. Of such contents only some are myself, and the rest are the external world, 126-9 B Epistemology. What it deals with; namely, that intuition, or immediate apprehension (literally, co-ordination of an object with a subject) which arises when, through attention being given to it, something or other (something of the external world, or perhaps of my- self) is given me, in experence, for my contemplation, 129-30 C The sense in which apprehended contents consisting of colours, sounds, etc. (which are obviously not myself) are really part of the external world, 131-3 D Limitations of this last principle, e.g. three stimuli occasioning one perception may be really only one stimulus; and three impres- sions from one and the same stimulus may be from three stimuli when closely exammed, 133-5 E But bare co-ordination is not yet knowledge.

IX (1929), pp. 67-79 Synopsis: A Sentences such as 'virtue is not square' are bad specimens of negation because they could not occur in genuine thought, 67-8 B In good specimens the predicate negated must be appropriate to the subject, 69 C It may be one of a set of alternatives disjunctively applicable to the subject (e.g. 'the signal is not red'), 69-70 D Such negations are found in inferences of elimination, 70-4 E The other type of appropriate- ness is teleological. The predicate negated is one we are entitled by the nature of the subject to expect to be present (e.g. 'That award is not fair'), 74-7 F All genuine negations are either disjunctive-eliminative or teleological. Confusion between these two types causes difficulties in Bosanquet's account of negation, 77-9 2 Is anthropology relevant to ethics? Symposium, Suppl. XX (1946), pp. 85-93 Synopsis: A Aim, to clarify, not to criticize L. J. Russell's view, 85 B Anthropology traces the connexion between taboos and social institutions. Can all the intuitionist's rules be so explained? 85-6 C Anthropology may persuade the Ideal Utilitarian to pay more attention to institutions in evaluating the common good, 87 D Russell expects moral philosophy to solve practical problems. But the task of appraising institutions and tracing their connexion with practical choices seems a non-philosophical one, 88 E The linking of rules with institutions makes necessary a middle course between intuitionism and 'Ideal utilitarianism', 88-93 3 True and false in morals, Vol. XLIX (1948-49), pp. 133-50 Synopsis: A Moral actions may be held not to presuppose explicit moral judgments. Yet moral judgments occur, and their truth or falsity is part of the wider question of the objectivity of moral characteristics, 133-6 B Recent subjectivists have analysed ethical sentences as expressing feelings or commands. This analysis is contrary to normal usage, 136-7 C Other sentences may perform these functions, and ethical sentences may fail to perform them, 137-42 D These 'meanings' are attached to ethical sentences by giving 'meaning' a sense not found in any normal usage, 142-5 E Subjectivists use language implying objectivity and fail to account for such use by ordinary men, 145-8 F When we meet differences of moral judgment, we use procedures in comparing them, which imply objectivity, 145-50 MACBEATH, A. 1 The moral good as a relation between persons, Symposium, Suppl.

Symposium, Suppl. XX (1946), pp. 94-121 Synopsis: A Summary of Dr. L. J. Russell's contentions, 94-7 B Relation of moral to social philosophy. Russell's view vis-a-vis Bradley's. Ethics as the study of man in his social environment. Consequently, ethics and social philosophy closely connected. Russell, however, identifies them and ignores the personal aspect of morality, 97-102 C Moral theory and moral practice. Criticism of the view that ethics should give practical guidance. The place of rules in morals. The principle on which a moral agent discovers his duty, 102-7 D Russell's distinction too rigid, between moral situations in static and in changing societies.

J. 1 Ethical positivsm, Vol. XLIX (1948-49), pp. 73-90 Synopsis: A Ethical categories are irreducible to non-ethical terms. The fundamental ethical category is 'intrinsic value', 73-4 B Values are data of experience. Suggestion that there are universal data, 75 C A 'positivist' ethics possible only if facts may be admitted as susceptible to value-predication. The analysis of facts into simple immediate data, like sense-data, necessarily precludes this, 75ff D Human conmunication is a fact which is also a value. It is 'given', but it is a definiens of humanity. In its simplest forms it involves self-identification of man with man, 78ff E Misunderstandings of 'self- identification', 81 ff F Deduction of specific obligations. Lying and promise-breaking as inhumanity, 87 G Review and conclusion with note on religious values. Aesthetic values are communication-values. Christian values are humanist, so, also, are communist values. Philosophers should seek to make explicit the universal human valuations, 89-90 MACDONALD, M. 1 Verification and understanding, Vol. XXXIV (1933-34), pp. 143-56 Synopsis: A In ordinary language we mean by the 'verification' of a proposition not what establishes its meaning, but what proves it true, 143-4 B I know the meaning of a proposition when I know what it is being used to represent. I verify it when I know by acquaintance what is represented, 144-5 C But can I verify it unless I first know what it is being used to represent? 145-6 D Application to propositions concerning the past. Can these be said to refer only to my own future experiences? 146-8 E Criticism of Professor Lewis's position which depends on an illegitimate use of language. No one would assert that an event occurred 'everywhere where its effects are' or mean by an 'effect' of it, everything which verifies it, 148-53 F Even if the meaning of a proposition is something I must construct out of my experience, how I understand it must still be distin- guished from what determines its truth or falsity, 153-5 G To distinguish an event's meaning from an experience of its verification does not make a metaphysical entity of it, 155-6 2 Induction and hypothesis, Symposium, Suppl. XVI (1937), pp. 20-35 Synopsis: A Inductive inference sometimes treated by philosophers as logically dis- reputable, 20-1 B Rationalists try to remove reproach by making inductive inference logically certain, and no longer inductive, 21-2 C It virtually denies empirical generali- zations; and it would exorcise the time factor, 22 D Criticism of Stout's view that without universal necessary connexion all happenings become accidental. By this inter- pretation 'accidental' loses its ordinary meaning and point, 23-4 E Empiricists accept undemonstrative character of inductive reasoning, and conclude that no empirical generali- zation can be known to be true, 24-5 F Ramsey and Ayer, e.g., therefore contend that empiri generalizations are rules for conduct and not propositions. But compare Ayer's view that empirical propositions are all hypotheses and probable, 25-6 G One can know, but can one believe (or disbelieve) a rule? Or an empirical proposition if it is a rule? How then can it be, in the ordinary sense, a hypothesis? 26-7 H Scientists' use of 'hypothesis' gives it a meaning not consistent with the statement that all empirical laws are hypotheses, 27-9 I We may know a proposition to be true without knowing it to be logically necessary, 29-31 J The problems of induction, causality and hypothesis concern the use of words in propositons, and the criteria used to determine whether the propositions are true, 31-4 K Some propositions express laws of nature. This implies that they are not 'merely probable-hypotheses', 34 L; What I can or cannot know is a question of the use of language, 34-5 3 The philosopher's use of analogy, Vol. XXXVIII (1937-38), pp. 291-312 Synopsis: A The nature of philosophy. Philosophers' statements are about words, and not analogous to the scientists' statements about facts; e.g. the philosopher's problem of universals, 291 ff B The problem of substance. The philosopher's 'analysis' of a thing x into substance and qualities only settles what qualities the name x is the name of, and is wrongly conceived as analogous to scientific analysis, 297 ff C Existence proposi- tions irreducible to the subject-predicate form. Russell's views criticized, 300ff D The false analogy which provokes the problem of a changeless subject of all change, 303ff E The real dispute is about how we speak, 307 f F Philosophy is not factual but verbal, in that its statements express, not how things must (or cannot) be, but how we must (or must not) speak, 308 ff G The criteria for the truth or falsity of philosophical proposi- tions are the uses of language, 311 f 4 The language of political theory, Vol. XLI (1940-41), pp. 91-112 Synopsis: A Of what sort are the propositions with which the classical political philosophers seem to have been chiefly preoccupied? 91-2 B Their leading questions.

What are natural rights and in what sort of propositions are they asserted? If metaphysical nonsense, why have they had political effects? 225-7 B Views of Stoics and of Roman lawyers about men's 'natural' equality. That no man was naturally a slave seemed to follow from the 'definition' of man, and also to state an essential fact about him. Involved confusion between definitions, laws of nature, and norms, 228-32 C This confusion re-appears in seventeenth-century discussions of natural law and rights of man. Man's rights derived from his nature as a rational being. Examination of the relation between right' and 'reason'. Conclusion: no natural fact about man, not even possession of reason, constitutes a necessary basis for natural rights. Nevertheless, they may be valid, 232-4 D Propositions and decisions. Value judgments are like the latter. Propo- sitions about natural rights are value judgments about conditions of a satisfactory social order. They are of the nature of social decisions, not scientific or legal laws. The taking of them sometimes explicit, but, more generally, 'shown' by the tone of a society, 242 ff E This accords with the otherwise curious fact that natural rights have tended to vary with different political writers. Assertions of natural right represent ultimate social choices, 242ff F Nevertheless they are not arbitrary. They may be defended by statements analogous to 'reasons' for a belief. Comparison with legal defence procedure and art criticism, 242-8 G Methods of non-scientific persuasion neither rational nor irrational. Value judgments are not true or false: they concern right and wrong action. Attempts to assimilate their establishment to scientific procedure may be both illogical and practically dangerous, 246-50 6 What are the distinctive features of arguments used in art criticism? Suppl. XXIII (1949), pp. 183-94 Synopsis: A What is work of art? Not indentical with any physical object, painted canvas, score, book, etc. 'Work of art' used differently, but for what more than is seen, heard, read, etc.? 183 B Function of criticism both to interpret and evaluate works of art. Critic's work distinguished from that of the scholar and historian who find out more facts about the physical object, 183-4 C Differences about value in works of art do not seem to be about facts which are common to both disputants. Of Reynolds and modern critics on the Venetians, 184-9 D The logical type of value judgments about works of art. They are not statements of any sort of fact, natural or non-natural, nor mere emotive utterances. They are more like judicial verdicts and awards, 189-90 E Not merely arbitrary. They must be justified by reference to the work. So justification is connected with interpretation. Interpretation determines what is the work of art. Again the difficulty of the object judged: of how 'work of art' is used, 190-1 F Mrs. Knight's view that value judgments are established by 'criteria' which represent qualities possessed by works of art. This seems (i) incompatible with the uniqueness, (ii) to presuppose that a work of art possesses qualities which can be 'listed' as such criteria, 191-2 G This procedure does not seem to accord with practice of criticism and continued re-valuation of works of art. Critics seem to create the work of art in interpretation. Yet this is not merely expression of a personal reaction, 192-3 H Comparison with acting and musical performance. These are interpretations which are also creative performances without which play or symphony could not exist. There is no work 'independent' of all such performances.

Criticism of Moore's position, 235-9 G The thesis here presented, that the occurrence of any cognitive event involves certain objects (complex or simple) of which some at least are independent of my existence, 239-50 H Perceiving, remembering, expecting (also 'mere' believing) as species of believing, 240-1 I Distinction between (i) supposition and (ii) perception (memory, etc.): supposing that something with P has also Q involves some object which has P and some object which has Q, but (as distinct from perceiving or remembering it) probably not the existence of any object which has both, 241-4 J The question in what way, in this supposal that P is Q, something really P and something really Q are combined, 244-5 KThe problem of how these objective participants in belief are related to that which is believed, 245-6 L 'Attitude of belief' and 'act of believing' not synonymous, 246-7 M The act is one of predication, 247-9 N Subjective participants in belief, 249-50 0 Summary, 250 2 The nature and validity of formal logic, Suppl. X (1931), pp. 27-42 Synopsis: A Logic as the study of actual thinking processes versus logic as the study of the formal conditions of valid thought, 27-9 B Analysis of a case illustrating the former, 29-31 C How the process, when valid, fulfils (as, if valid, it must) the condi- tions of validity studied in the other 'logic', 31-2 D The indispensability of the facts of formal logic to any psychological account of thought, 32ff E Ambiguity. The species of it which needs not be, and that which must be, vicious, 34-9 F The factual character of logically necessary relations, 39-41 G Problem of how they 'determine thought' although there is no psychological necessity to think validly, 41-2 3 Hume's doctrine of causality, Vol. XXXII (1931-32), pp. 301-28 Synopsis: A Causal propositions do not seem to be asserting observed uniformity of sequence and nothing more, 301-5 B It is not agreed that they assert even so much as that, 305-7 C Is there direct perception of a something more, which makes the experience one of apprehending causal connexion? 307-14 D Kohler's argument against crude sensationalism does not yield us this, 309-14 E Can the causal proposition be taken as asserting (not a matter-of-fact uniform sequence, but) a law? Johnson's teaching, 314-18 F If uniformities of law be what causal propositions assert, how is our knowledge of them obtained? 318-19 G Such uniformities are not reducible to uniformities of fact. They are assertable with too great assurance for that. Johnson's position here, correct. We reach knowledge of causal propositions by 'universalization', 319-20 H The difference between 'universalization' and 'generalization', 320-4 I Relation of effect to cause is not one of entailment. But neither is it, as with Hume, a mere matter-of-fact conjunction, 324-S5 J Some observations confirmatory of our analysis, 325-7 K Our view a clarification of the doctrine which vaguely connects causality with functional dependence, 327-8 4 MUST philosophers disagree? Symposium, Suppl. XII (1933), pp. 131-7 Synopsis: A Statement of the position that disagreement between philosophers isnot inevitable, 131-3 B Schiller s grounds for the position that various philosophers' views must be discordant, 133-4 C Mistakes in his premises, 134-S5 D Conclu- sions he mistakenly draws from them, 135-6 E Dr. Schiller's second train of thought- philosophy as a synthesis of historical philosophies, 136-7 5 Mechanical and teleological causation, Symposium, Suppl.

XVIII (1939), pp. 31-48 Synopsis: A From what sort of empirical data may knowledge of self be plausibly deriv- able? 31-3 B First the sense of sight. The data for our knowledge of the visual external world, 33-6 C The visual must be supplemented by other data if they are to yield our knowledge of self. The data of touch and of proprioception, 37-40 D How we know the self as mind, 40-3 E How far the self is and how far it is not 'after all, only the body', 43-8 8 Concerning imagination, Vol. XLIII (1942-43), pp. 21-36 Synopsis: A Two uses of the term imagination, 21 B Three ways of imagining, in the wider of the two uses of the word, 21-2 C Differences of the three, in their respec- tive relations to the actual and the possible, 22-3 D Linguistic or verbal imagination in this context. It may construct something (not which is possible, but) which only may be possible, and which, perhaps, in fact, is not, 23-4 E Can we exercise one of these kinds of imagination, say making mental images, alone and by itself? How do we use mental images when we imagine another person as colour blind? 24-5 F First, how do we use images for purposes of thought? 25-6 G Partly it is by using them to help us to assert or deny propositions, 26-7 H How I imagine what is going on in another person's mind, 28-36 I It involves my imagining that I am the other. How this is done, 30-3 J It is easier than imagining myself a disembodied spirit. Is this latter possible? 33-4 K Further elucidation of the manner in which we imagine things, 34-6 9 Does psychology study mental acts or dispositions? Symposium, Suppl. XXI (1947), pp. 164-74 Synopsis: A Preamble, 164 B It is less misleading to say that psychologists do, than to say that they do not 'study mental acts'. Instances showing this, 164-8 C But can they make observations which elucidate mental acts in respect of their inner natures? 168-9 D There are questions which do not admit of being answered by any observational pro- cedure but require 'analysis'. The two kinds of question must not be confused, 169 E There are some mental acts-namely my own-which are open to the special kind of observational procedure named 'introspection'. This, though observational, seems close to the desiderated 'analysis', 169-74 10 Some implications of analytical behaviourism, Vol. XLIX (1948-49), pp. 1-16 Synopsis: A Analytical, vis-a-vis other 'behaviourisms', 1-2 B What an 'analysis'- one which goes beyond the trivial-is, 2-4 C If behaviour may be allowed to include not only bodily acts but bodily states of readiness to act, then mental acts, as distinct from their 'objects' or 'contents' (similarly sensings, as distinct from their sensa) are susceptible of analysis into such behaviour, 4-5 D Always provided that interpretations may be testified to-or testified against-through appeal to more than one sense, e.g. the organic and proprioceptive senses, as well as the visual, 6 E Now if psychology, as a biological science, concern itself with dispositions towards certain bodily behaviour, which biology 0116</page><page sequence="121">MACIVER Mace, C.

XXIII (1949), pp. 61-8 Synopsis: A The defects of psychology. It has not failed to lay down conditions as to what evidence would be relevant to its truth, 61-2 B Its failure to become deductive is scarcely a shortcoming, 62-3 C Not true that the psychologist is either not con- cerned, or not concerned to any purpose, about causes, 63-6 D A wrongly presumed parallelism of type between psychoiogical science and physical, the probable source of our sense of something strange in the causal propositions of psychology, 67-8 MACFARLANE, M. 1 Realism amd values, Vol. XXII (1921-22), pp. 173-87.

M. 1 Is there mind-body interaction? Symposium, Vol. XXXVI (1935-36), pp. 97-108 Synopsis: A All thinking things are extended, 97-8 B Irrelevance of commonsense to the issue, 98-100 C The hypothesis here advocated: that what thinks is the whole visible and tangible human body, 100 D The fallacious cartesian argument to the contrary. It takes the thinker's mere ignorance of being extended to be a knowledge that I am not, 101-2 E The extended doubtless could not think if it were necessarily mechanical. But is it so? 102-4 F If not, then to refute mechanism is not to refute materialism, 104-5 G Thought as the adjustment of itself by a teleological agent to those of its circumstances which are relevant to the achievement of its purposes, 105-7 H Concluding remark, 107-8 2 Towards a new moral philosophy, Vol. XLVI (1945-46), pp. 179-206 Synopsis: A The recognized spokesmen of morality. Their remoteness from modern life, 179-80 B The modern problem which not even the newer teachers confront, namely our sheer inability to consider morality important, 180-3 C The considerations which, in Victorian times, sanctioned sexual morality have lost their point. The young, unable to solve their own problem, are left, thus, unassisted, 183-5 D The problem for moral philosophers: why this recession of moral seriousness? 185-6 E The root: the forces which have been whittling down our sense of individual responsibility, namely, those (i) of Marx, 186-7; F and especially (ii) of Freud, 187-8 G These influences have thriven upon the increasingly impersonal character of our society, 188-90; H and upon other changes, e.g. the loss, by morality (i) of its metaphysical sanctions, 190-2; I and (ii) of the support it had in custom, 192-4 J Fatal consequences of the 'political utilitarianism' which takes some political policy as the only morality, 194-201 K The new problem set the moral philosopher: what morality can no form of political utilitarianism displace, as, apparently, the German form of it did the traditional morality? In what sense it is an empirical philosophy which must answer this question, 201-6 3 The character of a historical explanation, Suppl. XXI (1947), pp. 33-50 Synopsis: A What was done, in human history, versus what it is convenient to suppose was done, 33-4 B Generalization legitimate in history; and this at different levels, 34-5 C The series of periods into which history is seen to fall varies with the level of generality from which it is viewed, 35-8 D Historical explanation. It is not the same as 'scientific' explanation, 38-40 E Always, for events at a given level, explanations should be found at the same level; e.g. at the level chosen by the Marxists, only 'materialist' explanations really explain, 40-3 F The whole story can also be told in terms of prob- lems, criticisms and suggested solutions. This level-that of ideas-is that at which idealist explanations explain, 43-5 G The mere difficulty of ascertaining the individual facts and doings of which it is the account, cannot make history any less an account, good or bad, of them, 45-7 H The absurdity of the idealist assumption that what happened in the past is whatever it suits us to suppose happened then, 47-8 I The two false 0117</page><page sequence="122">MACKENZIE Maciver, A.

V (1925), pp. 64-102 Synopsis: A Our present ideas and feelings about space and time. Their biological ante- cedents lie in a certain doing of space and time, which was indispensable to the survival of life, 64-7 B Some facts showing on what general conditions animals are able to (i) widen their field of movement, and (ii) elaborate their modes of action, as the species evolves, 47-70 C How his doing of space and of time has given man the headship of, without disconnecting him from, the animal creation, 70-4 D It refines his temporal and spatial relations to his environment and gives him an external world, 74-8 E The extent to which, in modern philosophy, the external world has been shown to be man's own. Displacement of the concepts of absolute time and space, in contemporary thought, 78-83 F Time as inner continuity in man's own experience. In this connexion, a medical case cited, as exhibiting the importance for human personality, of continuous memory, 83-90 G A similar disorder of the time-feeling in an otherwise very different case, 90-8 H His inherited capacity of doing space and time as the source of that creativeness in man which produces both science and the arts; and even personality itself, 98-102 2 Sensation and attention, Vol. XXVII (1926-27), pp. 243-90 Synopsis: A The temptation to ascribe at least the beginnings of sensation to an organism whose behaviour suggests it. Sensation could not rightly be attributed, e.g. to an (imaginary) animal consisting only of a respiratory system, 243-7 B And other systems, e.g. those of digestion and of vision admit of the same analysis as the respiratory, 248-60 C Pavlov's attempt to demonstrate a 'psychic centre' for salivary secretion examined, 260-9 D The real significance of his experiments. 'Associative memory', 269-74 E Is what passes as intelligence in animals really human intelligence? 274-6 F The impossibility of deriving consciousness from reflexes, 276-8 G Instinct not the ex- planation of intelligence, 278-85 H Conscious attention as the central feature of consciousness, 286-8 Our general thesis: that there is no sensation without voluntary attention, and no voluntary attention without consciousness; and that consciousness has emerged with human fellowship, 286-90 MACKENZIE, J.

The problem of seeming lawlessness in world-arrangements, 402-8 E (ii) Finitude as the changing. The problem of interpreting the time-process, 408-11 F (iii) Finitude as the evil prevailing, in a universe taken to be perfect.

C. 1 Evolution and Contingency, Vol. XXVII (1926-27), pp. 21-40 Synopsis: A Life, in all its forms, vegetative, sentient, rational, is 'habit': and habit implies indeterminacy as well as conditionedness by present conditions and past actions, 21 ff B This view, in rejecting the subjectivistuc account of sentient organisms, does not fall into the materialistic one. 'Habit' is a more fundamental concept than 'matter' ('gravitative habit') and 'mind' ('living sentent habit'), 24ff C The 'will' is free though the 'will' is a fiction, 33 f D 'Values' are Sviabilites', 34f E 'Luck' or 'grace'? These are two aspects of one fact, the rationalistic (as hitherto accepted) and the better rationalism of 'habit', which is admittedly a fiction, and implies a 'Reality' which is a theistic concept, 36 F All living things are evidence that events happen because they have happened before in similar circumstances-but the wood is not seen for the trees, 40 2 An attack on Aristotle, Vol. XXXV (1934-35), pp. 45-56 Synopsis: A Evolution, accepted as a more fundamental fact than 'subjects' and 'objects', makes AristoteSian concepts obsolete, 45 B The nature of things is their 'habit'- but 'habit' is only a convenient fiction, more convenient than 'mind' or 'matter', 46 C All the 'difficulties' of this view merely terminological.

I. 1 A note upon time and cause, Vol. XXXVI (1935-36), pp, 39-60 Synopsis: A The ordinary 'realist' account of knowing, which makes it consist of simple intuitions, is untenable, since it can allow consistently neither for error nor for the identity of the knowing self, 39-40 B That account is based upon the assumption that time is discrete. Its failure, therefore, should force us to accept the alternative conception of time, viz., as continuous, 41-3 C To which we shall be forced to add: (i) that time grows alongside its content ('the future' does not exist) and (ii) that no two beings can each occupy the same piece of time, 43-6 D No realist philosophy can escape self-contradictions in its epistemology, so long as it persists in presupposing that reality is fundamentally dis- crete. If, on the other hand, we take really seriously, in detail, the implications of acknow- ledging that time and activity are, each of them, both real and continuous in their nature, a satisfactory 'realist' epistemology can be constructed. Such a philosophy ends by re- habilitating the category of substance, but transfers it from its traditional timelessness into an unendingly expanding time, and makes 'selves' the ultimate substances in a develop- ing universe, 46-60 MACKINNON, D.

Vol. XLI (1940-41), pp. 1-26 Synopsis: A The conception that the task of philosophy is eliminative and eliminative of metaphysics, 1-3 B The scheme of this paper, 3-4 C The 'metaphysical' which the phenomenalistic positivist eliminates. It seems to consist of 'the things behind the curtain', those being 'unintelligible,' 4-7 D Such unintelligible eliminanda are found also to be superfluous-their work can be better done without them. Background of this -the assumption that human knowledge consists in the description of the sensible, 7-10 E In the other-the 'standpointless'-positivism, the background is much vaguer; being apparently a kind of intellectual contentment, 10-14 F The two judgments about the content of the thinking which is disparaged as 'metaphysical', 14 G Some of the debates of the traditional metaphysicians seem to have concerned genuine questions.

XIX (1945), pp. 77-91 Synopsis: A The important issue between phenomenalism and realism is-'What do we know when we know propositions about physical objects'? The issue is not whether such propositions are accepted as hypotheses or known more directly. For to this question the answer is 'some are of the former, some of latter sort', 77-8 B The foundation of phenomenalism, as Berkeley said, is the application of the empiricist view of meaning to the meaning of the term 'exists', 78-80 C On this view of meaning, 'existence' is meaningless as applied either to 'unsensed sensibilia' or to metaphysical substrata, 80-1 D The phenomenalist's account of the meaning of the past tense is necessarily complex. This is no objection to the theory, since familiar expressions with complex meanings often feel simple, e.g. 'holophrastic' words in primitive languages. Professor Price's 'as if' and 'expressive' theories of the meaning of statements about unsensed sensibilia are untenable. If 'x exists' is nonsensical, then 'if x exists' is nonsensical too. What sensibilists have in mind is the images used in pre-verbal thought about material things. Such thought cannot draw the distinction between actual and possible, but is adequate in the numerous cases where the distinction is unimportant, 82-5 E, F, G Only an apriori idea of existence can render the supposition of unsensed sensibilia significant. Much of our knowledge of the external world is indeed acquired by framing and testing hypotheses, e.g., the proposi- tions of physics. This method, however, cannot decide between philosophical theories of the meaning of such propositions, since such theories do not affect the predictions by which the hypotheses are tested. Phenomenalism does not imply that we never know that 'this is a real table'. On the phenomenalist view such knowledge may be based on the strongest possible inductive evidence. Concepts of physics such as 'electron', no less than concepts such as 'table', refer to actual and possible sense experiences. But they do so in a more complex manner, 86-91 MAIR, A. 1 The idea of a transcendent Deity: is the belief in a transcendent God philosophically tenable? Symposium, Suppl.

P. 1 Variation, heredity and consciousness, Vol. XXI (1920-21), pp. 13-50 Synopsis: A The central hypothesis in terms of which the three problems are treated is that the determinative states of mind and its imaginative constructs are forms of potential energy stored up as such in the brain, and that the determinative states of inherited bio- logical characters, and the new variations of them from which new species are evolved, are also forms of potential energy stored up as such in the germ plasm. These forms of potential energy are directed forces, psychological and biological vectors respectively. They pre- serve their specific characters, and in their respective mosaics their interaction exhibits a kind of Zwecklichkeit ohne Zweck so that, as products of creative imagination, the new ideas which emerge are novel but pertinent, much more than if they were due to the mere chance combinations of mere mechanisms. And in the same way the useful variations, which tend to survive by natural selection in the evolutionary struggle, occur much more frequently than if originated by mere chance mechanisms. As to the problem of explaining the essentially- qualitative nature of consciousness, in a physical world whose laws and processes are essentially quantitative, a new category is employed which I call anergy. It is primarily a mode of t/s, as motion is primarily a mode of s/t. When s/t becomes zero (as happens when a current of kinetic energy is redirected at, for example, the synapses in the brain) t/s passes through a state of infinity, whose discreteness and discontinuity can be taken as a quantitative definition of a quality. Thus, to say that states of consciousness are states of potential energy, is the same as saying that they are states of actual energy. The working out of this hypothesis gives that quantitative explanation of typical biological and psycho- logical phenomena which it was the object of the paper to discover, 13-50 MOORE, G. E. 1 Identity, Vol. I (1900-01), pp. 103-27 Synopsis: A Confused and obscure argument to show that there not only may be, but are, things which differ from one another numerically without differing conceptually, 105-11 B Contends that where two particulars differ from one another only numerically, there must be a universal which differs from each only numerically; but that where a uni- versal differs from a particular only numerically, there is not any universal which differs from each only numerically, 111-17 C Professes to distinguish five different meanings of the word 'identity', 117-27 2 Mr. McTaggart's 'Studies in Hegelian cosmology', Vol. II (1901-02), pp. 177-214 Synopsis: A Deals only with Chapter II of McTaggart's book, which it says falls into two distinct parts: (i) Says that McTaggart does not seem to be clear as to what he means by the words 'the universe is in each of its parts, as well as being a whole in which each of its parts is', and argues that McTaggart's conclusion (that if these words express a true proposi- tion, then the parts of the universe must probably be persons) depends on the false assumption that if one person is conscious of another, that other is 'in' the first, 179-88 B (ii) Argues that even if persons have a timeless existence, it does not follow, as Mc- Taggart seems to think, that each must exist at all times, 188-90 C (iii) Argues that even if McTaggart had given reason to think that we always have existed and always shall 0124</page><page sequence="129">MOORE Moore, G.

(a) the forms of intuition, viz. space and time and (,) the categories; and one at least of his reasons for maintaining this is that he thinks it explains how we can know synthetic universal propositions to be true, 127-30 B By explaining how we can know them to be true, he meant not only explaining how we come to believe them, but (which is far more important) giving a reason for thinking them true, 131-2 C But 'transcendental' idealism does not give a satisfactory reason for thinking them true, because (i) it is itself a universal synthetic proposition and can be no satisfactory reason for thinking itself true (ii) in the case of other such propositions, e.g. 2 + 2 = 4, it only would give either (a) a reason for supposing it was true of some objects, i.e. presented objects or (p) a reason for supposing merely that we should always think it true, 133-6 D Also there is no good reason to suppose it true, 137-8 E Besides his 'transcendental' idealism, Kant also has another 'idealism', in which he agrees with Berkeley, and which is also false, viz., the view that the matter, as distinguished from the form of the objects of experience, is also something 'mental', namely sensations, 138-40 5 The nature and reality of objects of perception, Vol. VI (1905-06), pp. 68-127 Synopsis: A The object of the paper is to discuss two questions: (i) How we know that anything exists except our own perceptions and what we directly perceive. (ii) How we know that there are any other people who have perceptions in some respects similar to our own, 68-9 B Explanation of what is meant by these questions is given; leading up to the conclusion that (ii) above, raises a question viz., (iii) What reason has each of us for believing that he would not have certain perceptions that he does have, unless some other person had certain particular perceptions? 69-84 C It is argued that if we ever have any reason for asserting that since one particular thing exists, another also probably exists or existed or will exist, part at least of our reason must consist in a generalization, 84-6 D If we ever have any reason for a generalization which asserts a connexion between the existence of a certain kind of perception in one man and that of a certain kind of perception or belief in another man, some reason for it must be given by observation, in a certain strict sense, 87-94 E It is suggested that, in order to justify a generalization to the effect that a thing of kind A is generally preceded by a thing of kind B, it is necessary (it is not suggested that it is sufficient) that three conditions should be satisfied, viz. (1) at least one object, (b) similar to B, must have been observed to precede an object (a), similar to A, (2) both (a) and (b) must have existed or been real, (3) the generalization must state, with regard to some relation observed to hold between (b) and (a), that an A is generally pre- ceded by a B standing in that relation to the A in question, 95-100 F Explanation is attempted of the sense in which the word 'observation' is being here used and of the fact that (a) a red patch or a movement which I perceive is different from my perception of it, and that (8) it and my perception of it may both be observed in the same sense; and it is asserted that since my perception differs from what I perceive, the latter may not be real, when the former is real, 101-4 G Tries to show that there is a common sense of 'exists' or 'is real' in which 'exists' does not mean the same as 'is perceived', and neither entails nor is entailed by the latter, 105-10 H Tries to show that unless some of the contents which I observe, other than my own perceptions, thoughts and feelings, do exist, nothing that I observe can give me any reason for a generalization of the sort mentioned in the fourth section (D above) 11-19 I The answer thus given to question (ii) in the first section (A above), applies also to question (i), 120-7 6 Professor _James's 'Pragmatism', Vol. VIII (1907-08), pp. 33-77 Synopsis: A The paper deals not with any view called 'Pragmatism', but only with the book to which James has given that name, and only with some of the statements he makes 0125</page><page sequence="130">MOORE Moore, G. E.-continued in it. The statements in question are statements about truth, and fall under three heads: (i) assertions of some connexion between truth and 'verification' or 'utility', (ii) assertions that truths are 'mutable', (iii) assertions that truths are 'man-made', 33 B As to (i) James implies the four propositions (a) that all those of our ideas which are true can be verified, (B) that all those which can be verified are true, (y) that all true ideas are useful, and (8) that all ideas which are useful are true, 34-5 C As against (a), it seems certain that we often have ideas about the past, which we can't verify, and we have other ideas which it is at least very doubtful whether we can verify. But to (,B) there seems no serious objection, 36-42 D As against (y) it is neither true that all true ideas are useful, whenever they occur, nor yet that those which occur only once are always useful on that occasion, 43-7 E And as against (8) it seems pretty certain that ideas which are false are some- times useful, 47-9 F Would James really maintain, as against those objections, that (a), (y) and (8) are really true? If not, why does he say what he does say? 49-62 G (ii) As regards the assertion that truths are 'mutable' (a) James uses language which seems to imply that he only thinks some truths to be mutable and (,) it must be admitted that some sentences can be properly said to express truth at one time and not at another; but I do not think this is all that he means: a sentence which expresses a truth at one time and not at another only does so because it expresses a different idea at the two different times, and each of these ideas, if once true, is always true; and this, I think, he means to deny, 62-70 H (iii) When James says that 'to an unascertainable extent our truths are man-made products', he seems to be confusing the true proposition that almost all our true beliefs are partly due to previous events in the minds of ourselves and others, with the false proposi- tion that because their existence is partly due to such causes, their truth is also partly due to the same causes. In fact it is only where a belief is a belief about something which men have helped to bring about that the truth of that belief, as distinguished from its existence, can at all properly be said to be 'man-made', 70-5 I Summary of what seems to be true, and what false in what James says. All the true things seem to be mere common- places, 75-7 7 The subject-matter of psychology, Vol. X (1909-10), pp. 36-62 Synopsis: A The special subject-matter of psychology consists of those among the contents of the universe which are 'mental' or 'psychical' in their nature. I call these 'mental entities', and my object is to consider what kinds of entities are 'mental', and how these are distinguished from those which are not 'mental', 36-7 B (I) Certain kinds of things which I do (and which, because I 'do' them, I call mental 'acts' though I may be passive in doing them) are undoubtedly 'mental'; and these are distinguished from all other entities by the fact that to do any of them is to be conscious of something. They may, therefore, be called 'acts of consciousness'; and to say that an act of consciousness is 'mental' is simply to say that it is an act of consciousness, 37-9 C Though this is the most fundamental sense of 'mental' there are others derived from it, viz. (1) that of being related to some entity in the way in which my mental acts are related to me, (2) that of being a 'quality' which distinguishes one kind of mental act from another kind, and (3) that of being a collection of mental acts related to one another in a special way, 40-51 D (II) In the case of each of the above four senses of 'mental', there undoubtedly are entities which are mental in that sense. But (1) it is doubtful whether my mind is not 'mental' in yet a fifth sense, 51-5 E And (2) it is doubtful whether any two mental acts which have different objects, also differ in quality; if they do, every such quality would be mental in the third of the above four senses, 55-7 F It is further doubtful (3) whether my sense-data are related to me in the same way in which my mental acts are, i.e. whether they are mental in the second of the four senses distinguished in sections B and C above; and even if it is true that every sense-datum of which I am at any time directly conscious exists only so long as I am con- scious of it, it would be misleading to say that it is 'mental' for that reason alone, 57-62 8 The status of sense data, Symposium, Vol. XIV (1913-14), pp. 355-80 Synopsis: A Sensory experiences are of five different kinds; in the case of all of them what is experienced must be distinguished from the fact that it is experienced; entities of the sort which are experienced in any of these will be called 'sensibles7, whether actually experienced or not; and the term 'sense-data' can be rightly used to mean the same as 'sensible' thus defined, 355-8 B (I) Relations of sensibles to our minds. (1) One relation which they have may be called that of being 'directly apprehended' by us; and this relation is different from that which our mental acts have to us, 358-63 C (2) There seems no reason to think that sensibles are ever 'in our minds' in any other sense than that of being directly apprehended or thought of by us, 363-6 D (3) Do sensibles ever exist at times when they are not experienced? Berkeley's view, that to suppose so is self-contradictory, seems clearly false. And in the case of one class of sensibles I seem to have 'a strong pro- pensity to believe' that they do so exist, under certain conditions; and two objections which may be urged against the view that in these cases they do, seem quite inconclusive, 366-70 E (II) Relations of sensibles to physical objects.

(a) that the side of a coin which I see is not identical with the visual sensible I directly apprehend in seeing it; whence 'see' is used in three different senses; and (,) that my knowledge of all five propositions is in the last resort based on direct apprehensions of sensibles, and perceptions of relations between directly apprehended sensibles, 370-3 F (1) One possible interpretation of these five propositons is one to which the great objection is that if this were what was meant, the words 'the coins existed before I saw them', 'are round', etc., would be being used in an outrageously 'Pickwickian sense', 373-6 G Interpretations (2) and (3) agree that I know the coins by description as the things which have a certain causal relation to the directly apprehended sensibles, and hold that they are only circular in a Pickwickian sense-which is an objection to them, 376-9 H to (4) which seems to be Locke's view, the main objection seems to be that it is difficult to answer the questions: how can I know that these sensibles have a source at all and that these sources are circular, 379-80 9 The implications of recognition, Symposium, Vol. XVI (1915-16), pp. 201-23 Synopsis: A Miss Edgell's vague language suggests that she regards the two views, (I) that both (a) we are often 'acquainted' with a thing which we are not at the time 'knowing by description' and (b) often ow by description' a thing with which we are not at the time 'acquainted'; and (II) that both (c) our 'sensings' of sense-data consist in the holding of a dual relation between the sense-datum and some other term, and (d) the sense-datum is always, in a certain sense, 'physical', as being each of them inconsistent with the truth of each of the four following propositions, viz. (a) that acquaintances with past objects with which we have been previously acquainted and acquaintances with our past experiences are not the only events in our mental history which are due to the influence of our past experiences, (,) that we do learn by experience, (y) that the existence of objects of acquaintance which are neither past experiences of our own nor objects with which we have been previously acquainted is often due to the influence of our past experiences, and (8) that definite memories are not the only events in our mental history which are due to the influence of our past experiences, 201-10 B (A) By way of showing this, she seems to limit herself to urging that Views I and II above are inconsistent (a) with the existence of a certain class of 'recognitions' and (b) with the existence of a certain class of 'awareness', 210-11 C (B) The class of 'recognitions' in question seems to be those which consist in our being aware, with regard to some sense-datum which we are 'sensing', that we have sensed a similar one before. But (1) she seems never to have considered the possibility that such recognitions may consist merely in our knowing with regard to the present sense-datum and the relation 'likeness' that we sensed in the past a sense-datum like this present one, 212-14 D (2) She seems to make the false assumption that any present sense-datum with regard to which we do know this must be qualitatively different from any with regard to which we do not know it, 214-17 E (C) The class of 'awareness' in question seem to be those which consist in our knowing with regard to two present sense-data, a and b, either that a is like b or that a is unlike b. But she seems to make no attempt to show that the existence of such knowings is inconsistent either with View I or with View II, but, instead, gives fallacious arguments to show that (a) they cannot consist in acquaintance with a complex fact, and (b) they also cannot consist in the holding of a multiple relation between us and a, b and the relation 'likeness' or 'unlikeness', 217-20 F (D) If Il(d) above be taken to mean that sense-data are constituents of physical objects, there is reason to think that this part of View II is inconsistent with the view that sense-data are modified by past experience, 220-3 10 Are the materials of sense affections of the mind? Symposium, Vol. XVII (1916-17), pp. 418-29 Synopsis: A The question which I intend to discuss is this: Has every sensation which is presented to me some relation to me such that it can only exist so long as it has that relation to me? 418-26 B I doubt whether the answer is 'Yes', because (a) I doubt whether every sensation presented to me has to me any other relation than that of being presented to me-whether, in particular, it has that of being 'lived through' by me in the sense in which my acts of attention are 'lived through' by me, 426-8 C (b) I doubt whether the relation of presentation itself is such that what is presented to me can only exist so long as it is so, (a) because it seems to me obviously logically possible that some presented sensations should continue to exist when they have ceased to be presented to me and (B) because there seems to me a clear distinction between presented sensations which I have observed to cease to exist, and those which I have observed to cease to be presented to me but have not observed to cease to exist, 428-9 11 The conception of reality, Vol. XVIII (1917-18), pp. 101-20 Synopsis: A Bradley asserts that 'Time ... has been most evidently proved not to be real', while at the same time he seems to insist that Time does exist, is a fact, and is. Are these two views consistent? I think not, and want to explain how he comes to think 0127</page><page sequence="132">MOORE Moore, G. E.-continued that they are, 101-10 B I think that part, at least, of what he means by 'Time is not real' is something which he ought to mean, something which most people would understand to be meant by these words, viz. that there are no temporal facts, 110-14 C In 'tem- poral facts are not real' 'real' is being used in the same way as in 'Unicorns are not real' and 'Lions are real', and a certain peculiarity in this usage is pointed out in the text, 114-16 D The reason why it is not seen that 'there are no temporal facts' is inconsistent with 'there are temporal facts' is that it is obviously true that even if there are no unicorns we can think of unicorns, and it is falsely supposed that from the proposition 'I am thinking of a unicorn' there follows the proposition 'There is at least one unicorn', it not being seen that in this respect 'I am thinking of a unicorn' differs from 'I am striking a unicorn', 116-20 12 Some judgments of perception, Vol. XIX (1918-19), pp. 1-29 Synopsis: A The judgments with which this paper is concerned are those which would be naturally expressed by such expressions as 'That is a door', 'This is a finger', in those cases in which (a) what we are speaking of and refer to by 'this' or 'that' is something which we are actually seeing, or feeling with our hands, at the moment, and (b) that which we are saying of the thing in question is something from which, if the judgment is true, it follows that the thing in question is a 'material object'. Some such judgments can be properly called judgments of perception, because when we make them we are actually seeing, or feeling by touch, that the object in question really is of the kind we are judging it to be, 1-8 B It is quite certain that when we make such judgments we can easily pick out from our total field of presentation a presented object which is, in an easily intelligible sense, the real or ultimate subject of our judgment, and that yet we are not as a rule judging of this presented object that it is of the kind expressed by the predicate used in expressing our judgment, 9-15 C What, in such cases, are we judging to be true of the presented object? (i) One view which it is very natural to take is that what we are judging when we judge, e.g. 'that is a door', is 'the thing of which that presented object is part of the surface is a door'. We certainly 'see' one part of the surface of the door in a sense in which we do not see the whole door, 15-18 D But this view can only be true, if the presented object really is identical with part of the surface of the door in question, and there are many strong arguments against the view that it ever is, 18-19 E One such argument is that when we see the same surface at two different times, t, and t2, and the surface itself has not changed perceptibly, it yet often seems that the presented object seen at t, is perceptibly different from that seen at t,, 19-23 F Can this argument be met by maintaining that in such cases the object presented at t1 is not itself perceptibly different from that presented at t,, but that all that is true, is that there is a perceptible difference between the kind of look it has, to me, at t,, and that which it has to me at t2? 23-5 G If not, or if for any other reason, we cannot hold that the presented object is identical with the surface seen, it may be suggested (ii) that there is some relation, with regard to which we know that the presented object has that relation to one and only one physical surface, so that what we are judging is of the form 'The thing of which the surface to which that presented object has R is part of the surface is a door'. But what relation can it be with regard to which we know this? (a) It might be suggested that it is some s ecial kind of causal relation; but this suggestion is not at all plausible, 25-7; H or (X) It may perhaps be an ultimate and indefinable relation, which might be called 'being a manifestation of'; but this also does not seem at all plausible, 27 I If neither (i) nor (a) nor (,B) is true, it seems as if what we are judging to be true of the presented object must be something of the Mill-Russell type, 28-9 13 Is there knowledge by acquaintance? Symposium, Suppl. II (1919), pp. 179-93 Synopsis: A What Russell has primarily meant by 'acquaintance' is something which certainly exists and which no one has ever doubted exists. Those who dispute whether what he has meant by it does exist, do so because they confuse the question what he means by the word, with the question whether certain theories of his about this indubitable fact are true, 179-80 B What he has primarily meant by it is a relation which we do undoubtedly have to sense-data. By 'sense-data' also Russell means things the existence of which no one has ever disputed; but people suppose that they do dispute the existence of what he means by the term because they confuse the question what he means with the question whether certain theories of his about the sort of thing in question are true, 180-2 C He means by 'acquaintance' one of the relations which, when I am actually seeing a tree and judge 'That is a tree', I have to the sense-datum about which I am making that judg- ment. But he may have used the word sometimes for one of these relations, sometimes for another, 182-3 D One of these relations is a relation which, it seems, we cannot have to universals; and Russell, when he has said that we are acquainted with universals, may have meant, falsely, that we have this relation to them, 183-4 E Which of his theories about 'acquaintance' are in dispute? (i) In the Monist in 1914 Russell has argued against a view which he calls 'Neutral Monism'. This view is a particular theory about 'acquain- tance with sense-data'; and those who hold it, while not, of course, denying the existence of 'acquaintance with sense-data', do deny the particular theory about it which Russell 0128</page><page sequence="133">MOORE Moore, G. E.-continued here advocates, 184-7 F (ii) Dr. Hicks and Dr. Edgell both seem to dispute Russell's theory that it is logically posssble to be 'acquainted with a sense-datum' without either judging or knowing anything about it; and here it seems possible they may be right, 187-90 G But Dr. Hicks seems to offer no argument tending to show that he is right; and against Dr. Edgell's argument that, if Russell were right on this point, it would be unintelligible how, starting with mere 'acquaintance' we should ever have arrived at knowledge about, there is to be said (i) that Russell's view does not entail that we start with mere 'acquain- tance' and (ii) that, even if we did, the explanation of how we arrive at knowledge about might be physiological, 190-2 H As for Russell's statement that 'acquaintance' cannot be deceptive, it follows from the two propositions (a) that we cannot be 'acquainted' with propositions and (/) that nothing but a proposition can be true or false in the sense in which a proposition can be, 192-3 14 External and internal relations, Vol. XX (1919-20), pp. 40-62 Synopsis: A A good many philosophers, including Bradley, attach great importance to some proposition about 'relations', which they express in a good many different ways, among others that relations 'affect' or 'modify' their terms or are never 'purely external' to any of the terms which they relate. This paper attempts to formulate precisely one proposition which seems to be at least part of what they mean, and to show that it is false: the proposition in question will be called the proposition that all relations are 'internal', 40-1 B It is certainly true of every relation that the fact that certain terms are related by it can never be identified with the collection consisting of the terms in question and the relation, 41-2 C And it is certainly true of some relations that the fact that a given term stands in the relation in question to another term at a given time may modify the term in question, in the sense of causing it to undergo a change, 42-3 D But what these philosophers mean is certainly not only the first, obviously true, proposition, nor yet the obviously false one, that all relations cause their terms to undergo a change, nor yet both together, 44 E One thing seems clear as to their meaning, viz., they mean that every different relational property which anything has 'modifies' the thing in question, in some metaphorical sense, 44-5 F And part, at least, of what they mean seems to be this: If 6 is a relational property, and A a term which has it, then anything which had not c would necessarily have been different from A, 46-7 G In this formula the words 'would neces- sarily have been' can be defined by reference to one very important use of the word 'follows'; and 'different from' means not only numerically but also qualitatively different from. But we will consider only that part of it which could be expressed by inserting 'numerically' before 'different' and will call this the 'dogma of internal relations', 47-50 H Under- standing 'internal' in this way, it is evident that any relational property of the form 'has x for a part' is intemal to that which has it, but any relational property of the form 'is a part of x' is not internal to that which has it, but purely external, 50-1 I If we use 'entails' as the converse of 'follows from', in the important sense referred to above, and use 'ent' as an abbreviation for 'entails', the dogma of internal relations seems due to the failure to distinguish between (1) propositions of the form (x,y):. Ox: ent: - ?y. D.y ? x and (2) propositions of the form (x, y) :. Ox: v: by. ent . y P x. The former are true for all values of 6, but the latter, though true for some relational properties, are false for many others, 51-7 J It has been held (a) that 'v' means the same as 'ent', in which case (1) and (2) would be identical and (b) that, though they are not identical, yet from every proposition of form (1) the corresponding proposition of form (2) follows; but both these views are obviously false, 58-9 15 Is the 'concrete universal' the true type of universality? Symposium, Vol. XX (1919-20), pp. 132-40 Synopsis: A Only discusses the views put forward by Mr. Scott as an answer to the question proposed. He seems to supposc that 'x is a universal' means 'x is both mine and others" and that 'x is concrete' means 'x contains its particulars', 132-3 B (1) One thing which he seems to mean by 'x contains its particulars' is 'x is an aspect of a thing which contains all the other aspects of the same thing'; and, if this is meant, there is reason to think that nothing whatever 'contains its particulars', 134-6 C (2) Another thing which he seems to mean is 'x contains all possible aspects of itself'; and, with this meaning, it may possibly be true that material objects 'contain their particulars', 136-7 D (3) One argument which he uses to show that what is both mine and others' (always or sometimes) contains its particulars is that every known real thing is both mine and others', and that some known real things contain particulars: but this (if the premisses are true) would only yield the conclusion that some things that are both mine and others' contain particulars, not that any (far less all) contain their particulars, 137-8 E (4) Another argument which he uses would, if its premiss were true, prove that everything which is both mine and others' contains particulars, but not that anything contains its particulars; and there seems no reason to think that the premiss is true, 138-9 F Mr. Scott seems also anxious to I 0129</page><page sequence="134">MOORE Moore, G. E.-continued maintain that every known real thing is both mine and others' and seems to use 'x is both mine and others' ' in three different senses. If it is used in (1) his proposition seems plainly untrue; if it is used in (2), it is true but trivial; if it is used in (3) it is certainly false, 139-40 16 The character of cognitive acts, Symposium, Vol. XXI (1920-21), pp. 132-40 Synopsis: A The term 'cognitive act' is often used, and will be used by me, in such a sense that there is no doubt whatever that cognitive acts do occur. This sense is that in which, that a cognitive act exists at a given time, follows from the fact that somebody 'is cognizing' something at that time, 'cognizing' being so used that 'x is cognizing' follows from 'x is seeing', 'is hearing', 'is remembering', etc. etc., 132-3 B Is it possible that my seeing of a sense-datum is identical with the sense-datum seen? The only conclusive argument against the view that it is, seems to be that in order that a sense-datum should be seen it is necessary that it should appear to have a certain character, 134-7 C Similarly all cogni- tive acts are events which consist in the holding of a certain kind of relation between two or more entities, each of which is an object cognized in the act in question, so that there is never any object which is the object of a cognitive act, 137-8 D But though some objects of a cognitive act are thus constituents of the act in question, an object which is only 'known by description' in Russell's sense, in a cognitive act, is not a constituent of the act in question, 138 E There is no reason to think that cognitive acts have 'contents' corresponding to objects cognized in them; and it is doubtful whether I am a constituent in every cognitive act of mine; but if one cognitive act has among its constituents an object qualitatively different from any which is a constituent of another, it follows that the two acts are themselves qualitatively different, 138-40 17 Are the characteristics of particular things universal or particular? Symposium, Suppl. III (1923), pp. 95-113 Synopsis: A We only ask here whether what Stout in his Hertz Lecture meant by the words 'Every character which characterizes either a concrete thing or a concrete individual is particular and not universal' is true, 95 B Part of what he meant by 'is particular' seems to have been 'characterizes one thing only', so that what he meant cannot be true, unless it is true that 'Every character . . . characterizes one thing only'. This alone will be discussed, since I cannot discover what else he may have meant, 96-9 C But what does he mean by 'character'? (1) He may mean that if, when we say of two different things, A and B, that they are both round or red, both propositions are true, then 'is round' or 'is red' cannot mean the same in both cases; a view which is obviously false, 99-103 D (2) He may be using 'character' in an improperly restricted sense, viz. to mean 'absolutely specific character'; and if (as it seems he must do) he holds that it is logically impossible for two different things to have the same absolutely specific character, e.g. to be of the same absolutely specific shade of red, he is obviously wrong, 103-5 E His arguments in favour of (2) are (a) that if two things, A and B, are 'locally separate', the specific colour of A must be 'locally separate' from that of B, and that therefore the specific colour of A cannot be identical with that of B; an argument which depends on the false supposition that 'characters' can be 'locally separate' in the same sense in which concrete things are so, 105-7; F and (b) an argument which depends on a premiss which he expresses by the words 'we cannot distinguish substances from each other without discerning a corresponding distinction between their qualities'. But if by this he means that we cannot distinguish two things, A and B, without perceiving with regard to some quality which we perceive to belong to one of them that it does not belong to the other, this is obviously false; and, if he only means that some quality which we perceive to belong to the one must, in fact, not belong to the other, there is no reason to suppose this true, 107-11 G More- over this premiss of Stout's clearly does not follow from the two true propositions from which he seems to think that it follows, 111-12 18 The nature of sensible appearances, Symposium, Suppl. VI (1926), pp. 179-89 Synopsis: A The paper mentions certain conditions which are often, though by no means always, fulfilled when we see a physical object; defines carefully what is intended to be meant by the words 'When the conditions mentioned are fulfilled, we are always directly aware of one and only one sense-datum which corresponds to the physical object in question' and maintains that the proposition expressed by these words, if used in the sense defined, is certainly true, 179-82 B Part, though only part, of what Broad, in The mind and its place in nature, called 'The sensum theory', is the proposition that when the conditions mentioned are fulfilled, then the sense-datum of which we are directly aware corresponding to the physical object seen is never identical either with the object as a whole or with the part of that object's surface which we are seeing or with any part of the object or of its surface, 183-5 C It is maintained, against Dawes Hicks and Price, that the arguments against this part of Broad's sensum theory are certainly not much stronger than those in its favour, 185 D The most powerful argument used by Dawes Hicks against this part of the theory is that 'in visual perception we seem to be apprehending directly physical things'. 0130</page><page sequence="135">MOORE Moore, G. E.-continued It is true that on philosophic inspection, the corresponding sense-datum does seem to be part of the surface of the physical object; and this is a powerful argument for its being so. But it is not nearly so powerful as Dawes Hicks thinks it is, because he confuses this fact with the very doubtful proposition (in which Broad agrees with him) that when we make such an assertion as 'This is a thumb' we are actually asserting that the corresponding sense- datum is part of the surface of a thumb. If this doubtful proposition were certainly true, it would be certain that the sensum theory was false, 185-7 E Other arguments used by Dawes Hicks seem irrelevant to the question whether corresponding sense-data are sensa or not, and though it is, as Dawes Hicks says, difficult to see how, if they are sensa, we get to know all that we do know about physical objects, Broad seems to be right in arguing that it is equally difficult to see this even if they are not sensa but parts of the surfaces of physical objects, 187-9 19 Facts and propositions, Symposium, Suppl. VII (1927), pp. 171-206 Synopsis: A A discussion of F. P. Ramsey's paper of the same title. We can distinguish (1) a class offacts consisting of those facts and those only which could be properly expressed by a sentence of the form 'I am now judging that p', (2) a class of events which are judgments in such a sense that every sentence of the form 'There is occurring now a judgment which is both a judgment of mine and a judgment that p' means the same as the corresponding sentence of the form 'I am now judging that p', and (3) a class of non-general facts, F2, such that every fact of kind (1) is entailed by without entailing one and only one member of F2, and that every member of F2 entails without being entailed by some fact of kind (1). Reasons are given for thinking that when Ramsey talks of giving a logical analysis of judg- ment, what he is really trying to analyse is facts of class (3) and not either facts of class (1) or events of class (2), 171-82 B Ramsey's proposition that every member of F2 contains at least one 'mental' and at least one 'objective' factor is only certainly true, if by 'mental' factor we mean a factor which, though possibly also objective is not merely objective, and which also is not the time which is a factor in it, 182-7 C His proposition that every member of F2 consists in the holding of some relation or relations between its 'mental' and 'objective' factors is questionable for two reasons, 187-8 D Every member of F2 contains more than one objective factor, but it does not follow from this either (a) that there may not be one objective factor such that the fact in question consists in the holding of some relation or relations between it and some non-objective factor or factors, nor yet (b) that there may not in every such fact be some objective factor which contains all the other objective factors, 188-91 E The view that if two facts of class (1) are so related, that one of them is the fact that a certain person is judging a certain proposition to be true, and the other the fact that a certain person is judging the same proposition to be false, while the proposition in question is in fact true, then both the member of F2 which entails the one and the member of F2 which entails the other always have for an objective factor the fact that the proposition in question is true, is certainly false, for the simple reason that no member of F2 can possibly entail with regard to a given proposition both that that proposition is true and also that somebody believes it to be false; but if, as is often done by philosophers, 'judge' is used in such a sense that 'I know that' entails 'I judge that', then in some cases the member of F2 which entails a fact of the form 'I judge that p' will also entail that the proposition judged to be true is true, 191-3 F On the other hand, it is perfectly certain that a fact of the form 'I judge that p' never entails that the proposition judged to be true is in fact true, whereas facts of the form 'I know that p' or 'I perceive that t' always do entail that the proposition in question is true-perception and knowledge are 'ifallible', judgment is 'fallible', 193-4 G Ramsey's assertion that phrases of the form 'the fact that p' are not 'definite descriptions' (in Russell's sense) seems doubtful, and even if it is true, does it follow from this fact together with the fact that such phrases are also not names, that the fact that Caesar was murdered is not a factor in the member of F2 which entails the fact that I know that Caesar was murdered? 194-8 H Against Ramsey's statement that 'it is true that p' means no more than 'p' it is urged that if I judge that it will be fine tomorrow and it is in fact fine on the day in question, then the fact that I made that judgment has to the fact that it is fine a relation which may be called 'correspondence', and that sometimes we use 'it is true that p' to mean 'if anyone were to judge that p, the fact that he did so would correspond to a fact', and that this statement though logically equivalent to p is not identical with it, 198-200 I Three objections are urged against what Ramsey says about the 'mental' factors in members of F2, 200-3 J Objections are also urged to Ramsey's arguments for, and arguments in defence of, the view that fa must enter into the meaning of 'for all x, fx' 204-6 20 Indirect knowledge, Symposium, Suppl. IX (1929), pp. 19-50 Synopsis: A This attempts to distinguish clearly the most important among several different senses in which a man's knowledge that-so-and-so-is-the-case, is said to be 'indirect' or 'mediate', not 'direct' or 'immediate'. The sense of 'knowledge' in question is that in which a man cannot be said to know that so and so is the case except at a time 0131</page><page sequence="136">MOORE Moore, G. E.-continued at which that it is the case is actually before his mind-a sense which may be called 'actual- ized knowledge'; it is not the (perhaps commoner) sense in which a man may be said to know that so and so is the case at times when that it is the case is not before his mind- a sense which may be called 'dispositional knowledge', 19-22 B The sense of 'indirect' in question is that in which, to say that a case of actualized knowledge is a case of 'indirect' knowledge, is to say that it was 'based upon' an actualized knowledge which occurred within the same specious present, of some other fact,-this in the sense of 'based on', in which when we first learn any fact by inference or by testimony, our knowledge of that fact at that moment is so based, 22-7 C It seems to be a mistake to suppose that every fact which is known indirectly in this sense is inferred, 27-9 D The sense of 'based on' in question may be called 'immediately based on', and it seems that this relation between two cases of actualized knowledge can only hold when both occur within the same specious present: it is clearly different from another proper sense of 'based on', which seems to be the relation 'ancestral' (in Russell's sense) to this relation, 29-33 E A third sense of 'based on' which is clearly different from this, is that in which some cases of knowledge by memory are based on a previous perception: we may call this 'mnemically based on'. From the fact that one case of actualized knowledge is 'nmemically based' on another, it does not follow that it is 'immediately based' on anything, 33-8 F A fourth sense of 'based on' is that in which to say that one actualized knowing is based on another is to say that some 'relative product' (in Russell's sense) of the two relations 'immediately based on' and 'mnemically based on' holds between them, 38-43 G Although, in all these four senses of 'based on', part of what is meant by saying that one actualized knowing, K,, is based on an earlier one, K,, is that K, was causally dependent on K,, it can be clearly shown that in the case of none of them is this the whole of what is meant, 45-7 H The difference between the case where an actualized knowing of a fact is 'immediately based on' an actual- ized knowing of another fact, and the case where you are reminded of a fact, which you already know independently, by an actualized knowing of another fact from which you might have learnt the first, is obscure, 47-50 21 Is goodness a quality? Symposium, Suppl. XI (1932), pp. 116-31 Synopsis: A Is solely concerned with the question whether, when Joseph in his Some Problems of Ethics says (p. 75) that he is going to 'defend the assertion that goodness is not a quality', what he means by 'goodness is not a quality' is true or false, 116 B If we ask how Joseph is here using the word 'goodness', it seems possible to infer that what he is mainly concerned to assert is that no intrinsic character for which the word 'good' ever stands, is a quality, 116-20 C And if we ask how he is using the word 'intrinsic' it seems possible to infer that, sometimes at least, he means by 'intrinsic goodness' the character which we attribute to an experience when we say it was 'worth having for its own sake', 120-5 D If we ask how he is using the word 'quality' it appears that the most important thing that he means by 'goodness is not a quality' is that any intrinsically good thing is identical with 'its goodness', 125-8 E And by 'its goodness' he may mean either (1) the character which we rightly attribute to it when we say that it is good, or (2) the special complex of characters which justify us in calling it good; and he seems in fact to mean both and to confuse them with one another, 128-30 F That intrinsically good experiences are not identical with (1) is shown by the fact that the character which we attribute to two different experiences, when we rightly say both are good, is the same; and that they are not identical with (2) is shown by the fact that in the case of two numerically different intrinsically good experiences, the complex of characters which justifies us in calling them good may be the same. But if we are talking of 'goodness' in the sense in which a poem may be good, there cannot be two different poems which have the same complex of characters, 130-1 22 Imaginary obyects, Symposium, Suppl. XII (1933), pp. 55-70 Synopsis: A Deals only with the class of propositions which Ryle has described as 'proposi- tions, seeming to be about Mr. Pickwick, which Dickens makes in Pickwick Papers', and discusses only some of the things which Ryle and Braithwaite have said about such propositions, 55 B (1) The class in question seems to be identical with the class of propositions expressed by sentences in Pickwick Papers in which either (a) the words Mr. Pickwick' occur or (b) some word occurs, such that 'Mr. Pickwick' could be substi- tuted for it without changing the meaning of the sentence, 56-7 C (2) (a) Ryle's view that these propositions are not 'about Mr. Pickwick' is true as far as he means (i) that there never was a man at whom anyone could have pointed and said with truth 'That is the man Dickens meant by "Mr. Pickwick" ' and (ii) the totally different proposition that Dickens did not use 'Mr. Pickwick' as a 'logically proper name'; but it is false so far as he means (iii) that the words 'These propositions are about Mr. Pickwick' are not good English for anything which is true, 57-9 D (b) Ryle's view that each of these propositions entails the proposition 'One and only one man was ever called "Mr. Pickwick"' is hopelessly false; and Braithwaite's that by 'Jane Austen' he usually means 'the person called Jane 0132</page><page sequence="137">MORGAN Moore, G. E.-continued Austen' is almost as bad. As a rule, when we use a proper name, our proposition does not even entail that someone was called by that name, far less that only one person was, 60-3 E (c) Ryle seems to imply the utterly false view that whereas 'Mr. Pickwick', as used by Dickens, is 'a concealed predicative expression', 'Christchurch' is not, 64-5 F (3) When Braithwaite says that Dickens was using 'Mr. Pickwic.k' as a variable, he seems to mean by this partly something which is true and important, partly something which is false. And his view that Dickens was also always talking about the name 'Pickwick' is also false. It is explained why, even if there had happened to be a man of whom everything was true which Dickens relates of Pickwick, it would not have followed, as Ryle thinks it would, that Dickens' propositions were about that man, 65-70 23 Is existence a predicate? Symposium, Suppl. XV (1936), pp. 175-88 Synopsis: A When people say that existence is not a predicate, they seem to mean that something or other which is true of the way in which finite parts of, e.g. the verb 'to growl' are used, is not true of the way in which finite parts of the verb 'to exist' are used. Of what that is true about the use of 'growl', are they saying that it is not true about the use of 'exist'? 175-7 B (I) Taking that particular use of 'exist' which occurs in 'Tame tigers exist', we can say (1) that with 'growl' used as it is in 'Tame tigers growl' the three sentences 'All tame tigers growl', 'Most tame tigers growl' and 'Some tame tigers don't growl' all make good sense, but with 'exist' used as it is in 'Tame tigers exist' the three sentences 'All tame tigers exist', 'Most tame tigers exist' and 'Some tame tigers don't exist' make no sense at all, 177-81; C (2) that, whereas 'Some tame tigers growl' means 'At least two values of the propositional function "x is a tame tiger and growls" are true', 'Some tame tigers exist' means, not 'At least two values of the propositional function "x is a tame tiger and exists" are true' but merely 'At least two values of "x is a tame tiger" are true'. 'This is a tame tiger and exists' is meaningless if 'exist' is being used as it is in 'Tame tigers exist', whereas 'This is a tame tiger and growls' makes perfectly good sense. Russell is mistaken when he says 'Existence is essentially a property of a propositional function', 181-5 D (II) But there seem to be at least two other usages of 'exist'. (a) Wherever, pointing at an object, it makes sense to say 'That is a tame tiger' it seems also to make sense to say 'That exists', because it makes sense to say 'That object might never have existed'. Perhaps what is meant by saying of existence, in this sense, that it is not a predicate, whereas, e.g. growling is, is that 'That exists' alwavs forms part of what is asserted by 'That growls, whereas it is not a part but the whole of what is asserted by 'That exists'. (b) Of sense-data, e.g. after-images seen with closed eyes, it seems also to make sense to say 'That exists', because it makes sense to say 'That might never have existed'. And the reason for saying that existence, in this sense, is not a predicate, whereas, e.g. being red or round, is, is perhaps the same as in the case of (a), 186-8 MORE, P.

It is basically a study of Berkeley and is developed in some degree of conscious opposition to Alexander. The numbering given below is that of the paragraphs. The article discusses the pos- sibility of an account of reality as a whole which should retain 'within its appropriate universe of discourse' the Berkeleian emphasis on the spiritual source of all phenomena, without prejudicing 'the acceptance of a scientific account of the physical world, of life and of mind'.

But the fact of knowledge is the appearance which perfectly accords with (or which perhaps is) the coin's real (i.e. round) shape, 195-9 B Besides the sphere of such facts of knowledge (just described) there is the sphere of knowable facts.

Is there a truth-structure of the universe, or is truth only (as with James) 'within the mind'? 210-13 J Conclusion. We recognize truth (i) in the sphere of knowledge, (ii) in the structure of the knowable, and (iii) as correspondence of these, 213-14 K Such truth cannot be rightly condemned as 'static' 214-15 3 The physical and the psychical nexus between generations, Symposium, Suppl.

I may refer immediately (as when I see the thing) or mediately (as when, e.g., not seeing it, I have a mental image of it), 1-2 B There may also be 'reflective' reference, i.e. reference, but not to objects, e.g. an intellectual schema (by bringing it into connexion with which, we interpret an object), 2-3 C Of the fundamental kinds of relatedness which occur within any organism and between organisms four (none of them ever being emergent from any of the others) are temporal, spatial, physical and referential related- ness, 3-4 D Of any of these kinds, the modes emerge one from another, 4 E But, though thus, e.g. the human organism, is an emergent system of spatio-temporo-physico- referential relatedness, it may be abstractedly considered. We may (and often do) consider it, so far as it consists in the first three (S T P) as 'the body' and so far as it is the last, as 'the mind'. If each of these correlated kinds of relatedness is emergent from earlier modes, then I and any sensed object (say Jupiter seen in the heavens) are not only in S T P relatedness but also in R relationship, 4-5 F And this reciprocally, in each case, 5-6 G The hypothesis here advanced: if one organism m be in such S T P relatedness to another n as to 'influence' it (and be influenced by it) then the two are also in relations of reference, both from n to m and from m to n, though not necessarily in the same mode of such R relatedness, 6 H Why 'influenced' here, and not 'caused', 6-7 I From m (planet in the heavens) to n (an observer of it) there is S T P influence; and from n to m there is R (referential) relatedness, 7-8 J The standing problem: to correlate 'thing' with 'object', the influencing S T P system and the object referred to, the events in the sky and the Jupiter we see.

R. I The concept of energy, Symposium, Suppl. V (1925), pp. 28-54 Synopsis: A How a contradiction came to make its appearance among the principles of physics, 28-33 B How such contradiction becomes the spring of scientific advance, 33-5 C If (as Descartes thought) physics were a revealing of reality, then a contradic- tion in its answer to the question, What is conserved (and so real)? would be intolerable. But was Descartes right? 35-7 D Science is not uncovering for us the permanent substance of things but is working out the consequences of an assumption it finds it needs to make, viz., that something is permanent, 37-9 E For the physical it is energy that is (and quantitatively) conserved. Is he any the worse for not being able to say what energy is, as distinct from making statements about it? 39-40 F Entropy is in parallel case, and no difficulty, 40-1 G Has the difficulty any other basis than the old assump- tion that physics is concerned with the ultimate or first principles of reality? If this were its concern, contradiction would condemn it, 41-2 H What, then, is the concern of science? Not (as Descartes thought) first principles 'so simple that nothing can be simpler' 43-6 I It would seem that science is concerned with what would happen, on certain presuppositions, 46-7 J Are the basic presuppositions the same in the various sciences? Is it energy that is presumed conserved in the sphere of other sciences than physics? It seems not to be so in e.g. biology, 47-51 K If the different sciences proceeding on their different hypotheses together provide one coherent explanation of the whole, the basic principle of that coherent explanation is not the conservation of energy, 51-2 L What determines the various sciences to adopt the hypotheses they do, as fruitful and worth pursuing, and to reject others? Does the totality follow any pattern? Kant's position, 52-3 M The conditions on which physics could rightly be asked for a clear definition of energy are not fulfilled, 53-4 2 Judgment as the fundamental act in knowledge, Vol. XXVI (1925-26), pp. 53-68 Synopsis: A Perception. The perception which leads to knowledge is always (a neces- sarily true) judgment; for it is always the perceived answer to a definite question which, in setting out an experiment, we have been putting to nature, 53-8 B If this is the nature of knowledge, ordinary attributive judgments are of no significance for logic, 59-60 C We must move forward from (the traditional) Aristotle to what is essentially the Kantian position, 60-4 D Bradley. From Bradley's standpoint a judgment, for logical purposes, must be taken as something necessarily true, and it is about independent fact or reality, only indirectly, 64-6 E That is, it really asserts necessary connexion, 66-7 F Even the historical judgment does this-or, if not, history does not interest the logician, 67-8 3 The notion of emergence, Symposium, Suppl. VI (1926), pp. 49-55 Synopsis: A The simplest form of 'emergence' theory, 49 B According to the mechanist, to say anything 'emerges' is to confess you cannot understand it, 49-50 C The only reply open to the advocate of emergence-that to accept nothing as explana- tion which is not mechanistic explanation is prejudice, 50-1 D The issue depends on whether emergence is fundamentally as intelligible a concept as causation, 51-4 E Such a claim would appear to be inadmissible, 54 F On what conditions ideally perfect knowledge would recognize emergence, 54-5 4 What can philosophy contribute to the study of politics? Symposium, Suppl. XII (1933), pp. 86-99 Synopsis: A Does political inquiry make any essential contribution to the study of the good life? 86-90 B Determination of the nature of the good life cannot be wholly indepen- dent of the examination of the facts about society, 90-1 C Nor would the facts of political experience be determinable by an inquirer refusing to commit himself to some conception of the nature of the good life, 91-4 D Can we observe purely as matter of fact that certain political arrangements have been inimical to, certain others preservative of, let us say, 'liberty'? 94-6 E We cannot suspend our view of the good life and simply 0135</page><page sequence="140">MORRISON Morris, C.

IV) a lowest, a middle and a highest motive to human action, namely, appetite, anger and reason, 134-5 C On the other hand, in Rep. VIII and IX, the men of the lower types (except the tyrannic man) all seem to act in some sense from reason. The sense is that they have ends, to which they employ means, in a deliberately calculated way, 135-6 D Reason, here, does not move us. It is not a motive in the sense in which appetite was a motive. It does not make us desire, but only exposes means towards what we already do desire, 136-7 E If this were Plato's final view, he would be open to (for example) Kant's censure, 137-9 F Is it his final view? Without having seen clearly (and so without having guarded against) the Kantian objection, he yet does not hold to the view to which the Kantian objects, 139-41 G In Plato's final view the good man is rational in another than the meagre sense in which e.g. the timo- cratic or oligarchic man must be pronounced rational (for whom the good is something that can be desired, and means to it taken). The good man's good (the Idea of the Good) is known or contemplated, not desired, 141-2 6 The act of judging, Vol. XXXVIII (1937-38), pp. 241-52 Synopsis: A The apparently inescapable bias in all social and political judgments, 241-2; B whether they be 'of fact' or 'of value', 243 C Is the whole corpus of a man's opinions an outcome of some emotional or other non-rational conditionng, rather than anything rationally determined? 243-4 D When the facts are not conclusive what determines me to the opinion which I form? 244-5 E An act of will, as Descartes suggests? But it seems that opinions form themselves in me, rather than that I form them, 245-6 F Is the formation of opinion just a natural process which we ought to trace out? 246 G We cannot turn this position by equating opinion with knowledge of probability, and so maling its formation wholly reasonable, 246-7 H The precise sense in which we are here concerned with opinion and its formation, 247-8 I The charge to be met-that the rational formation of an opinion is literally not possible, 248-9 J The formation of an opinion cannot be proved rational by any reducing of it to what it is not, viz. the apprehending of a probability, 249-50 K Reasoning plays a part in the formation of opinion, even though the irrational in us is never wholly in abeyance, even in logic or mathematics, 250-1 L That we cannot show the rationality of opinion by isolating the rational element does not prevent our attributing the highest value to the attempt to be as rational as possible, 251-2 MORRISON, D.* I The treatment of history by philosophers, Vol. XIV (1913-14), pp. 291-321 Synopsis: A The problem.

By regarding certain sentences in everyday speech as 'isolated', a 'universal jargon'-an empiricist means of scientific communication-can be made. It could be regarded as based on compromise-a kind of 'orchestration', 128-9 C 'Unified science' does not eliminate all gaps or even all inconsistencies, but tries to localize them. So 'THE System' cannot be regarded as its aim, but 'Encyclopaedism' might be, 129-30 D The selecting of terms for a 'universal jargon' has to be based on 'decision'. It cannot be based on an "account' of anything, 130-1 E Dangerous terms. How to avoid them.

Protocol statements involving personal names and sensation-terms provide a basis-a 'vague' basis-of physicalism. (Contrary views of K. R. Popper and others on this point). So 'The system' cannot be regarded as its aim, but 'Encyclopaedism' might be, 134-7 G Families of dangerous terms: truth terms, value terms, causation terms, ideal type terms, 137-43 H Logical empiricism v. traditional rationalism. Logical empiricists have not the un-ambiguity of the latter. Theirs is only a 'proposal' for a universal jargon. They expect rival proposals. They are in principle tolerant, as rationalism could not be. They lean towards pluralism.

H. 1 Philosophical theories, Vol. XLVIII (1947-48), pp. 165-86 Synopsis: A Philosophical theories are neither true nor probable in the sense in which empirical hypotheses and logical statements are. In science and everyday life we use a linguistic schema; philosophy provides them, 165-6 B The dogmatist wants proposi- tions that both are certain and eliminate significant alternatives. The sceptic proves this to be impossible, 167-9 C This is illustrated by the problem of justifying induction and by the problem 'are there necessary truths?' 170-2 D We must abandon eternal truths and watertight proofs. To prove a proposition conclusively is to make it apriori, 173-5; E e.g. the fundamental proposition of induction, if it is to remain significant, must be logically deniable, 176 F Both the dogmatic claim and the sceptical counter- claim sterilize thought, 177-8 G Philosophical theories die, not because they are false, but because they are inadequate, 179-81 H Current theories of definition similarly sterilize thought. The philosopher does not define existing terms; he re-models them, 182-3 I Some philosophical theories (e.g. empericism) must be rejected if they claim to be true. They may be valuable as recommendations ('let's stick as near as we can to the sense-level'); but not as propositions ('all words can be reduced to sense-words'). Language is a tool which must be efficient in various ways. To fulfil one up to the hilt is to neglect others, with disastrous results, 184-6 2 Science and politics, Suppl. XXIII (1949), pp. 153-64 Synopsis: A Objections to the notion of a science of politics rest on a misunderstanding of what a science is, 153-4 B Sciences differ among themselves; the question is 'In what ways is solving political problems like solving scientific problems?' It is more mis- leading to say politics is not scientific than to say it is, 155-6 C Problems about means are scientific.

How his failure is connected with his special ambition, 105-6 B He probably took epistemological criticism too lightly, 106-7 C His philosophy of perception as betray- ing a mental need to work with the form of temporal experience, while yet he gives the temporal the status of appearance, 107-11 D The self. How known. It is not, for McTaggart, subject-which-is-never-object. His theory of memory. His position vis-a-vis the 'bundle' theory of the self. The special difficulties which the unreality of time presents, for a philosophy of the self, 111-15 E Error. Is its source in the subject? If so, is it necessarily the temporal view of things, and not rather the postulate of the unreality of time? Are arguments against change necessarily fatal to time? 115-17 F 'Futurity' of the timeless, all-inclusive whole. McTaggart versus the British Hegelians 118-21 G Mc- Taggart's view of pre-existence and post-existence, 121-3 H Values. Do they survive in a timeless setting? The question of determinism, 123-5 I Conclusion. The value of McTaggart's philosophy (and its failure) as connected with its ambition to correlate real and temporal relations convincingly. Is it impossible to argue apriori for the reality of time? 125-8 O'CONNOR, D.

But is the argument sound? First, two ineffective objections, 41-3 E An objection (which, however, it is not open to a determinist to bring) which does invalidate the argument: there are no such clear and consistent rules for the use of the word 'free' as it presupposes, 43-6 F Given such rules, there is no strictly-philosophical problem, 46 ORR, S.

But what qualifications does the philosopher possess? 17-18 B Methodological philo- sophers have sometimes sought a recipe for arriving at the truth. There is no such recipe, 18-30 C Nor is there a recipe for 'being reasonably certain'. There are only counsels of prudence which do not allow of rigid formalization, 20-5 D The methodologist has to describe science, which involves him in logical issues, 26-7 E The major contem- porary methodological problems are about the possibility of generalizing a method (e.g. quantification). These are exactly the traditional problems of philosophy, 27-30 F The philosopher needs a certain amount of special knowledge to be a methodologist: methodo- logy is the study of philosophical problems as they arise among the special sciences, 30-2 PATON, H.

W. 1 The moral good as a relation between persons, Symposium, Suppl. XVIII (1939), pp. 106-22 Synopsis: A Statement of the thesis (i) When we judge actions morally, we do so by refer- ence to something judged to be good. The good which is our standard in moral judgment is only one among many things judged to be good. (ii) It is not primarily an end for which we act. (iii) It is a kind of relation between persons-community, 106-7 B Considera- tion and rejection of (a) idealist and (b) utilitarian accounts of the good by which actions are morally judged. (a) Vagueness of the conception of system or integration. (b) Failure of Utilitarianism to account for the distinction between 'just' and 'unjust'. Rashdall's view criticized, 107-13 C The good by which actions are judged-to be conceived primarily as something to be respected in action rather than as an end to be achieved. Morality as observance of a law: the law as based on good but not as an injunction to strive for an end in the future. There is a good to be respected now. (i) In some sense the good is to be achieved. Even so it is achieved in the action rather than by it. (ii) In simple moral actions the end for which the action is done is distinct from the good by which the action is judged, 113-18 D Restatement of reasons for denying that the good by which actions are morally judged is the total good, or the most good. Consideration of simple judgments of approval of truthful, just actions, etc. suggests the good is a relation between persons. The description of this in terms of order or system inadequate. The relations recognized as good are most clearly exemplified in friendship between persons. More generally they are relations of community, 118-22 PICKARD-CAMBRIDGE, W.

R. 1 Why are the calculuses of logic and arithmetic applicable to reality? Symposium, Suppl. XX (1946), pp. 40-60 Synopsis: A Introduction: reference to distinction between logical rules of inference and so-called logical calculi (i.e. artificial language-systems), 40 B This distinction ex- plained. Difference between rules of inference and calculi corresponds more or less to that between rules of inference and logical truisms, 41-4 C Re-statement of Professor Ryle's treatment of the problem. It (his treatment) reduces the problem to a pseudo problem. But cannot one find a genuine problem behind the pseudo problem? 44-6 D A genuine problem: why are the rules of inference of any use? 46-7 E First answer: because they lead from true premisses to true conclusions. This leads to re-formulated questions: why do they do this? 47 F Second answer (to the question as just reformu- lated) Because we call by the name rules of inference precisely such rules as can be relied on to lead from true premisses to true conclusions, 47-8 G Application of this result to three views concerning the nature of logic. Application to Aristotelian syllogistic, 48-52 H Application to our original problem. So far, we have discussed only rules of inference. Now we proceed to logical and arithmetical calculi, 52-4 I In so far as a calculus is applied to reality it loses the character of logical calculus and becomes a descriptive theory which is empirically refutable; and in so far as it is treated as irrefutable-logically true- it does not apply to reality, 54-7 J Only if we know how to abide by a refutation, do we know how to speak about reality. Speaking about reality is a performance, 57 K But many problems remain. Facts are not just bits of reality. A fact is, rather, 'something like a common product of language and reality'. A fact is 'like reality pinned down by descriptive statements'.

The problem to be discussed is the problem of deduction itself- more precisely, the problem of giving a satisfactory definition of 'valid deductive inference'. The definition is to be sufficient for establishing the validity of propositional and (lower) functional logic, 251 B Definition of auxiliary terms: 'interpretation', 'statement- preserving interpretation' 'form-preserving interpretation', 'logical skeleton', 'logical form', 'formative sign', 'descriptive sign', 251-61 C A definition of 'valid deductive' inference is proffered (Dl) and discussed; result of discussions: (D2) using 'logical skele- ton'; (D3) using 'form-preserving interpretation', 261-5 D Comparison and discussion of these three definitions.

By the method of examples, it is to be shown that there exist problems, not only pseudo-problems, in philosophy, 141-2 B How a logical analysis of argumentation could have influenced the two recent philosophical revolts, against (i) apriorism, and (ii) verbiage, 142-3 C The philosopher who has become a student of problems rather than of subject-matters. How logical analysis may aid him, 144-5 D The problem of causality: the necessity of the connexion of an event E with its cause I.

H. 1 The nature of sensible appearances, Symposium, Suppl. VI (1926), pp. 162-78 Synopsis: A Dr. Dawes Hicks says that in visual perception we seem to be approaching physical things directly. But what we approach directly might in fact be a constituent of a physical thing, even though we could not know that it was, but could only believe it on more or less good evidence, 162-3 B The real questions at issue between the sensum theory and the 'appearing' theory are: what entity do sense-given qualities qualify? and do they qualify the same thing as physical qualities do? 164-5 C In settling the problem whether two qualities qualify the same entity, we ordinarily use several criteria simulta- neously. What if some of the criteria are satisfied and others not? Are there different degrees of consubstantiality? 166-7 D Two forms of sensum theory. One holds that sensa are discrete, the other that there is a sensory continuum. According to the first, two sensa 'of' the same object are always numerically different entities. This is paradoxical, if we accept our ordinary criteria of consubstantiality, 167-8; E and no sensum can either persist or change, which is still more paradoxical; moreover, every sensum is created ex nihilo, 169-70 F This theory may be compared to the Cartesian theory of divine conservation, and has the same difficulties, 170 G Dr. Broad's theory of a sensory continuum avoids some of them. But it unifies one person's sensa too much, and different people's sensa too little. And the sensory continuum still had to be perpetually created from moment to moment, 170-2 H Could we say, then, that sense-qualities sensed by different people are consubstantial with each other and with physical qualities? No, in view of the facts of illusion. We can only say that sense-qualities appear to qualify the things which physical qualities really qualify, 171-2 I Difficulties in the 'appearing' theory. An attempt to answer them. (1) In a single perceptual situation, we cannot know what it is that appears such and such; only that it is something or other, 172-3 J (2) Double vision. We must distinguish between 'A looks double' and 'A looks as if it were double'. The first statement is nonsensical but the second may be true. Whether it is true can only be settled by comparing several perceptual situations, 173-6 K (3) Hallu- cinations. It might be that in complete hallucination a past object appears to be present, or that (in the case of telepathic apparitions) a distant event appears to be happening a few yards away, 176-7 L (4) How can a thing look what it is not? This unanswerable if sensing is assumed to be a form of knowing. But there is no need to make this assumption, even though sensing is a direct relation between mind and physical object, 177-8 2 Mill's view of the external world, Vol. XXVII (1926-27), pp. 109-40 Synopsis: A Problems arising from the fact that sensation is not an immediate knowledge of physical objects, 109 B Thomas Reid's solution was to distinguish sensation from perception: but perception does not seem to be knowledge either, 109-10 C The alternative solution, adopted by J. S. Mill in his Examination of Hamilton, is to alter our conception of what a physical object is, 110-11 D Sense-data are particulars, but they are not substances, 111 E Mill's view (which may be called the 'idealistic' theory of the external world) is that a physical object consists simply of actual and possible sense-data. But he does not work it out in sufficient detail. Can his omissions be made good? 112-14 F One concerns the notion of thing or object. Realistic critics have objected that when a number of sense-data are said to be appearances of the same thing, their unity is a unity of centre, not (as Mill holds) a mere unity of system, 114-15 G The 'centre', however, might be merely a three-dimensional geometrical shape, not a thing in the realistic sense, 115-17 H This shape may be called the standard fure of a family of sense- data, 117-18 I How can we distinguish between two familhes whose standard figures are exactly similar? Only by finding that they are located in different regions of space. For this, we must co-ordinate whole sense-fields into a single spatial pattern. How are we to do so? 118-20 J Mr. Russell's solution of this problem.

H.-continued three-dimensional standard pattern, 122-3 L Two different types of spatial relation between sense-data: (1) when the sense-data are in the same sense-field (2) when they are in different ones, 123-4 M What commonsense calls a single space is better described as a system of sensible spaces, 125-6 N What of the spatial relations between two objects which are so far apart that sense-data of both objects cannot occur within a single sense-field? 126ff 0 Professor Alexander's expedient of an 'angelic observer'. An all-embracing space could be constructed out of 'angelic' sense-fields. A map might be regarded as depicting a part of a space so constructed, 128-30 P The statement that two sense-data 'belong to the same object' can now be analysed without introducing the realistic conception of an object, 130-2 Q Unfortunately we are not angels, and are not directly acquainted with 'angelic' sense-fields. But on any theory we cannot know that two sense-data belong to the same object; we can only have evidence for believing it, 132-4 R We can, however, know what is meant by saying that two sense-data belong to the same object; and our meaning can be analysed in the way suggested above, 135-6 S Another difficulty arises from the notion of a possible sense-datum. If an unperceived object consists of possible sense-data only, in what sense can it be coexistent with a perceived object? Only in a Pickwickian sense, involving hypothetical kinaesthetic experiences, 136-7 T Such a theory is not so outrageous to commonsense as might be thought. For common-sense has no clear view on such questions. And in any case we do in fact have this knowledge of alternative possibilities of sensation, 137-9 U Note. How far, on this view, our knowledge of space may be called a priori, 139-40 3 The so-called space of sight, Vol. XXVIII (1927-28), pp. 97-116 Syniopsis: A Special mental attitude suggested for discussing this subject. We must refrain from referring our sense-data to objects, and must attend to the sense-data them- selves. This 'inspection of sense-data' is not to be confused with pure sensation, 97-8 B The normal visual field is a voluminous pattern of coloured forms. Visible forms are to be distinguished from geometrical figures, 99ff C A visible form has no parts; it is an intensive not an extensive quantum. It has 'massiveness', but that is not susceptible of division or addition, 99-101 D The same applies to a visible pattern of many co- presented visible forms: it is an organic unity whose elements are internally related, 101-2 E Its organization depends on three pairs of relations. Those pairs of relations are not dimensions. Unlike geometrical co-ordinates, they are not arbitrary but fixed. And visual distance from right to left is not commensurable with visual depth, 103-4 F Unlike a geometrical figure, a visible form alters in quality when its situation is altered. It has a position-quality (?=local sign) rather than a position, 104-6 G The 'visible motion' of a sense-datum is a qualitative change, and is not the sum of the motions of its parts, 107-8 H Other differences between a visual field and a region of space. Geometrical size is relative but sensible massiveness is absolute, 109-110 I In every visible pattern there is a dominant form and a background. An aesthetically-perfect view, however, is one complex form, not a pattern of several forms, 110-12 J Even the most monotonous visual field contains internal differences, at least of intensity, 112 K There is, however, a correspondence between the visible and the spatial. To a single geometrical figure there corresponds a series of inter-substitutable visible forms. How the substitution may be brought about, 113-15 L Likewise, what corresponds to a set of spatially related figures is not a single visible pattern but this together with its possible substitutes, 115 M And this relation of correspondence is reversible. A geometrical or physical shape represents a set of inter-substitutable visible forms; and an arrangement of geometrical or physical shapes represents a set of inter-substitutable visible patterns, 115 N Physical objects and geometrical shapes are more familiar to us than visible forms, which are seldom attended to. Hence 'physical models' have to be used in describing visual fields: but they must be used with caution, 115-16 4 Negation, Symposium, Suppl. IX (1929), 97-111 Synopsis: A Mr. Mabbott holds that disjunctive characteristics do not 'objectively' characterize particulars; Mr. Ryle, that they can, 97-8 B Mr. Ryle seems to be right. It is an objective fact about a particular (1) that it possesses a generic characteristic, (2) that it possesses one of the set of specific characteristics falling under this, 98-100 C Mr. Mabbott holds that disjunctive characteristics do characterize universals. But it is not literally true that colouredness is either red or green, etc., nor that it is either redness or greenness, etc., 100-1 D Elimination. Not all elimination occurs within the sphere of genus and species; e.g. in 'the cat is not here', 'here' is not a species of space. We should rather say that elimination occurs within a whole, which may or may not be a genus, 101-3 E The statement that negation is subjective is itself negative. It says that negative charac- teristics are not real, 104-5 F Relation of negation to elimination and disjunction. This cannot be the differentia of negation, for affirmations are often preceded by disjunc- tions. There is a similar objection to the view that negation 'presupposes a negative suggestion'. And some affirmations presuppose a negative suggestion, 105-6 G Further, every disjunction includes a number of negations within it. So it would be circular to 0150</page><page sequence="155">PRICE Price, H. H.-continued define negation in terms of disjunction, 106 H Moreover, a disjunctive premise will not yield a negative conclusion, unless there is, in addition, an independent negative preniise, 106-7 I Thus there are some negations which are not reached by elimination, since elimination presupposes them: e.g. 'red is not green'. The motives which might make us say this are irrelevant: in any case it is true, 107 J Mr. Mabbott on teleological negations. (1) Can a question concerning logical form be settled by considerations of sub- ject matter? (2) There is no contradiction between 'A ought to be B' and 'A is not B'. (3) The meaning of 'not' is the same, whether the thing negated is an ideal or something else, 108-9 K Mr. Mabbott is also committed to review metaphysical views about teleology, 110 L 'The soul is not a fire-shovel', far from being nonsensical states a true proposition and is a logical consequence of propositions which are admittedly true, 110-11 5 Our knowledge of other minds, Vol. XXXII (1931-32), pp. 53-78 Synopsis: A The analogical theory. Recent writers reject it and prefer the intuitional theory. They hold that, on occasion, each of us knows other minds intuitively, 53-4 B The intuitional theory is highly paradoxical. The main arguments for it are the arguments against the analogical theory: (1) that our beliefs about other minds are not in fact acquired by analogical reasoning (2) that infants, and animals, could not acquire them in that way (3) that even the adult knows little about the appearance of his own body from without, 54-6 C It is replied that beliefs not reached by analogical reasoning might still require it for their justification; further that they may even have been reached by such reasoning originally, though the reasoning has been forgotten and only its conclu- sions are retained, 56-8 D As to infants, perhaps they only behave as if foreign organ- isms were animate; such behaviour might include vocal utterances, 58-60 E Nor would this imply that infants are solipsists. They do not deny or doubt the resistance of other minds: they just do not consider the question, 60-1 F The alleged animism of primi- tive man is irrelevant. For the animist believes that all material objects are animate; and what has to be explained is the belief that some are but others are not, 61 G In any case, the animism of primitive man is a greater difficulty to the intuitional theory than to the analogical theory, 62-3 H The intuitionist holds that facial expression is a natural sign of a foreign mental state. But it is really an inductive sign of probable future actions. 'Tact' is not intuitive but inductive: and it is certainly fallible, 63-5 I Tele- pathy, though a well-established phenomenon, is irrelevant. It is not a form of knowledge but a form of causation, 65-6 J Nor does our knowledge of moral obligations pre- suppose a direct acquaintance with other minds: for what is known may be hypothetical, e.g. that if this body is animate, I ought to do so and so, 66-7 K Intuitionists hold that social consciousness precedes self-consciousness both temporally and logically. This is only plausible if 'self consciousness' means either explicit introspection, or consciousness of oneself as a debtor, or teacher or the like, 67-9 L But self-consciousness proper (Kant's pure apperception) is prior, not posterior to consciousness of other minds, 69-70 M Might the intuitional theory still be true, though supported by bad arguments? It may be that all attentive awareness so accompanied by a dim or background awareness of 'something more'. But this will not help, 70-1 N It might be said that after we have acquired a large number of highly determinate beliefs about another person, a direct knowledge of his mind sometimes supervenes upon those beliefs. But such knowledge, if it exists, is very infrequent and could not be the basis of our everyday beliefs concerning other minds, 71-2 0 Must we then return to the analogical argument? No. There is a third alternative, a teleological argument. My own purposive activities are sometimes obstructed, sometimes facilitated, as if some purpose other than my own were at work, 72-4 P This argument is a restricted form of the theological argument from design, 74-5 Q Our beliefs concerning unconscious mental processes in ourselves is based on a similar argument; and anyone who denies the existence of unconscious processes in himself ought logically to deny the existence of other minds, 75-6 R The argument makes no reference to the bodies of other people but only to their purposes. But it does imply that the only foreign minds I am entitled to believe in perceive the same world as I do, and have purposes generically similar to my own, 76-7 S The analogical argument, in so far as it is cogent, is a special case of this one. What is relevant is not the visible shape of a foreign body, but the purposiveness of its behaviour, 77-8 6 Some considerations about belief, Vol. XXXV (1934-35), pp. 229-52 Synopsis: A Our starting-point is a theory of belief mainly derived from Cook Wilson. The distinctions between knowledge (infallible and direct) and belief (fallible and indirect). The correspondence theory of truth applies to belief, not to knowledge. Distinction between knowledge and belief, 229-30 B One cannot both know and believe the same thing at the same time. The word 'judgment' is a source of confusion, 230-2 C Prima facie analysis of belief into two factors (1) entertaining a proposition (2) assenting to it, 232ff D The nature of entertaining. We are not committed to the theory that propositions are subsistant entities. Before forming a belief we entertain several alternative propositions, 232-4 E Assent contains two factors (1) preference, (2) confidence, 0151</page><page sequence="156">PRICE Price, H. H.-continued Preference does not admit of degrees, confidence does, 234 F Assent is given upon evidence. The evidence consists of facts which are known, not merely believed. Thus all belief contains knowledge, 235 G The distinction between 'reasons' and 'causes' is really a distinction between two sorts of causes, cognitive and non-cognitive. The latter operate by restricting our attention. When there is no evidence either way, we cannot believe, though we can decide to act as if we did, 235-6 H Belief contains the know- ledge that we may be mistaken. When this is absent, we are 'taking for granted' or 'accept- ing', not believing. An example analysed: no alternative before the mind, no preference, no confidence; the process is associative, not rational, 237-8 I Evidence for the 'accepted' proposition may in fact be present, but it is not used as evidence, 238-40 J This completes our exposition of the theory. Some difficulties in it must now be con- sidered, 240ff K The evidence for a belief often seems to consist of propositions which are themselves only believed. They may be 'reasonably certain', but is such 'certainty' knowledge? 240-2 L The strict use of the word 'know' (=apprehend) contrasted with the popular use, which covers reasonable assurance as well, 242-3 M It might be said that when we believe, we have at least a reasonable assurance concerning the evidence. This reasonable assurance is often perceptual, 243-4 N But the evidence frequently comes from memory. Much memory is only belief: but some memory is knowledge in the strict sense, though fragmentary and indeterminate, 245-6 0 What of reasonable assurance itself? Must the evidence for it be knowledge in the strict sense? But will this apply to perceptual assurance, which not all admit to be reasonable? 247-8 P There is an intermediate state between belief proper and taking for granted which the Cook Wilsonian theory omits. Perceptual assurance is an example of it; another is the assurance of 'experienced persons' concerning objects with which they are familiar, 248-9 Q Two cases: (1) Sometimes we have had evidence which we have now forgotten: our assurance remains and is still reasonable, 249 R (2) sometimes we have known a large number of facts favourable to the proposition in question, but did not use them as evidence when we knew them. Our assurance grew up unconsciously without consideration of alternatives: but here also it may be called rational, 250-1 S An attempt to define this second sort of rational assurance, 251 T It is fortunate that such assurance is possible, since conscious assent upon evidence is rarer than philosophers suppose, 251-2 7 Memory-Knowledge, Symposium, Suppl. XV (1936), pp. 16-33 Synopsis: A The distinction between memory-knowledge (infallible) and memory- belief (fallible). If there is no memory-knowledge it is impossible to establish that any memory-belief is mistaken, 16-17 B For this is estabhshed either by testimony or by documents or by physical signs of some sort. In relying upon these, we rely upon inductive generalizations, and the grounds of these in turn are remembered instances, 17-19 C The modern doctrine that memory-judgments are really about the future. To know what future events will verify them, we must use induction, and therefore memory, 19-20 D The criteria of recency, vividness, and consistency, 20ff E To know that a memory is of a recent event, I must use memory again. Further the criterion of recency can only be validated by induction, and therefore by memory. The same applies to the criterion of vividness, 20-1 F Consistency. What is relevant here is causal consis- tency, not logical consistency. And only induction will tell us whether it is causally impos- sible that both Ml and M2 should be true; and this means memory again. Moreover 'causally impossible' only means 'very improbable', 22-3 G Thus some memory must be knowledge: otherwise we have no ground for thinking that any memories are mistaken. There are also several grades of memory-belief, 24 H What is the function of the memory-image in memory-knowledge? One answer is that the image is the past event itself. 'But a past event cannot also be present.' Yes, it can, if 'present' means presented, 25 I A more serious difficulty: the memory-image differs qualitatively from the past sense-datum: and we know that, and how, they differ, 26-7 J And a single image would have to be identical with several past sense-data; or with all the sense-data belonging to a certain class, 27-8 K Could a group of actual and possible images be identical with a past sense-datum? But however many of these images were actualized, we should still know that there could be others more accurate. How could we know this? 33-1 L And a single sense-datum would have to multiply itself into a group, post mortem; or else it was latently a group from the first, which is still more paradoxical, 31 M A more plausible theory is Professor Stout's. He holds that the memory-image directs our attention to this past event rather than that, 31-2 N The biological disutility of recollecting our whole past all at once (cf. Bergson). It may be, however, that we do 'retain' the whole of it, 32-3 0 This is not a representative theory of memory; for it holds that we know past events themselves, as well as the images which direct our attention to them, 33 8 Touch and organic sensation, Vol. XLIV (1943-44), pp. i-xxx Synopsis: A Why theory of knowledge is primarily a theory of sight and touch, i B Very often, theory of the external world varies according as the theorist (unconsciously) begins 0152</page><page sequence="157">PRICHARD Price, H.

A. 1 Creative morality, Vol. XXIV (1923-24), pp. 131-52 Synopsis: A The definition of goodness implies the functional relation which man has to the universe. This does not mean ethics deduced from metaphysics, but that ethical 'intuitions' and 'axioms' must, to avoid stigma of subjectivity, be tested by consistency and coherence, 131-2 B But here we discuss, not metaphysics but 'experience of value', implying the assumption that reality reveals value, 132-3 C Concrete examples of exper- iences of value, under the general headings: beauty, truth, goodness, 133-5 D (i) These experiences are distinct ('beauty' is not literally 'truth') (ii) they interpenetrate, (iii) they supplement each other. In particular, the moral involves fullness of life of the whole man, 135-7 E Vital moral conduct is expressive, and is not mere conformity to laws, 137 F How is vital moral conduct initiated? The 'instinct' hypothesis is not sufficient, even if supplemented by 'emergence'. Instincts are not a priori principles of explanation, but functionings in a limited environment. Why should not human value-environment evoke new 'creative' responses? 137-40 G Experiences of value are 'emotional'. But it is innate need to adapt, not to instinctive environment but to the universe revealing value, which energizes creative responses. Emotion is an important concomitant, 140-1 H Creative responses are always individual, and very different from the 'pattern-reactions' of instinct, 142 I Responsive conations within the value-experience are to be distin- guished from the embodiments in some 'material' which follow it. Here we consider expression in the 'material' of social-moral life, 142-3 J Objectively values meet in the universe-revealing value. Subjectively the experiences interpenetrate. This universality gives to creative goodness its roving quality. Four observations, 144-6 K Man's supreme good as 'realization of value', both as experience and expression: and this includes artistic as well as moral expression. Right actions as securing maximum value-realization, 146-7 L Justice, rightness-and-fact, and rightness-and-goodness, discussed. Right- ness and the limitations of the 'material', 148-51 M The ideal life is the creative life of the discovery and expression of value, a life never complete and continually new, 151-2 2 The nature of beauty, Vol. XXVI (1925-26), pp. 25-52 Synopsis: A The paper will discuss aesthetic experience, and the nature and status of beauty, but not art, 25-6 B Aesthetic experience is (with only apparent exceptions 0155</page><page sequence="160">REID Reid, L. A.-continued not here discussed) sensuous, but also significant, 27-8 C The aesthetic 'types' of Bullough, Myers, Valentine are aspects, or emphases, or stages, rather than 'types', and psychological experiments over-simplify the complexity of aesthetic experience, 28-31 D How can sense-experience be ineffably significant? Importance of organic and percep- tual events: 'empathy', 31-4 E Symbolism and 'association'. Direct aesthetic signifi- cance of different percepts (and significance through association) which must be fused, while worlds of experience are being focused in a single intuition possessing form and perfection, 34-9 F Bullough's 'psychical distance'. 'Distance', though one essential factor, is not the differential criterion; form, or variety-in-unity being necessary, and, in its turn, a condition of 'distance'. 37-42 G The conviction that aesthetic experience gives a perfect knowledge beyond reasoning. The facts (i) that it is a 'perfect moment' of living, (ii) that so much is fused into the moment, (iii) that intellectual activity here is perfectly completed, all account for claims of unique knowledge, 42-6 H As for the status of beauty, it is, unlike physical objects, conditioned by our minds-and-bodies, though apprehended as objective, 46-9 I Analysis of the objectivity of beauty, 49-51 J It is from the symbolic focusing of a wealth of genuinely objective values by means of a perceived object, that beauty derives its objectivity, 51-2 3 Beauty and significance, Vol. XXIX (1928-29), pp. 123-54 Synopsis: A Introduction: opposition to the view that the content of art is unique, and that life is irrelevant to it and it to life. Plan, 123-7 B Distinction of 'primary', 'second- ary' and 'tertiary' subject matter. Recognition of these refutes both the alleged imitation- ism, and the isolationism, of aesthetic experience, 127-34 C The evil as content of art. Two questions (i) can secondary subject matter be 'evil'? (Probably not, though primary subject-matter may be.) (ii) Does the critic's judgment, that tertiary subject-matter is evil (e.g. morbid, perverted) properly affect his judgment of beauty or ugliness? And is the critic's judgment subjective? The fusion and transformation, of moral inaesthetic values, 134-8 D The problem of aesthetic meaning. 'Greatness' and primary subject matter. 'Intensive' and 'extensive' significance 138-43 E Aesthetic expression. Expression becomes aesthetic when carried out for the sake of its felt intrinsic value.

Inexpressiveness, 147-50 G Beauty and u;liness and their degrees. Maximum beauty a function of the highest significance (intensive or extensive) with posi- tive value, perfectly expressed, (Other degrees derivable from this), 150-4 4 The limits of psychology in aesthetics, Symposium, Suppl. XI (1932), pp. 169-86 Synopsis: A Outline of an 'ontological' as opposed to a 'psychological' view of art's content. The former means that art embodies the values of a world which is larger than the world of our minds and bodies. Summary of the chief ways in which it comes to do this, 169-76 B The value of value: Richards' 'psychological' theory-of fulfilled appetency, harmonious self-organization, etc. This naturalistic view refuted by Moore's question-'Are these good?' It is refuted also by fact that values are ingredients in a subjective-objective situa- tion, 177-84 C The values revealed in art belong (roughly) to form and to content. The latter may (sometimes) include an ingredient not only of 'moral' good, but of mystical good, leading to new imaginative vision, 184-5 D There is a psychological part of aesthetics, but aesthetics is epistemological, distinguishing subject and object and their influences on one another. Psychology can only deal with one half of the aesthetic problem, 185-6 5 Knowing in Music, Vol. XLI (1940-41), pp. 113-26 Synopsis: A The setting of the problem: plan, 113-19 B The elements of music and their effects upon us. Rhythm, sound, tonality, 114-17 C The experience is emotional, and significant. Significance as coming through form, bodily factors, entrants from non- musical experience, 117-20 D How does musical apprehension become enriched by meanings derived from life? Vernon Lee and 'ancestors of emotion', 'infinitives of verbs', 120-3 E Non-musical images may be simply present, 123 F 'Mystical' insight and music, 123-5 G A balanced view necessary. Types' of listening (Myers, Vernon and others). But the 'types' overlap and it seems better to think of different 'levels', existing perhaps together, but always in due subservience to the forms of the music, 125-6 6 Reflections upon knowledge-intuition and truth, Vol. XLVI (1945-46), pp. 235-58 Synopsis: A The subject under discussion is the truth of concrete intuitive knowledge, e.g. of persons, acts, moral goodness, religion. 'Knowledge' used in a wide sense, 235-7 B Contrast between intuition as embodied 'involvement', and conceptual understanding- detached, analytic, 237-40 C Truth of propositions is not correspondence; it is knowing, and not propositions, which is in the end true or false, 240-2 D Senses in which correspondence may, and may not, legitimately be used, 242-4 E If knowing, not propositions, be true, the way is open to thinking intuitions (non-propositional) to be true, 0156</page><page sequence="161">RITCHIE Reid, L. A.-continued 244 F Truth of intuition itself, versus of propositions arising therefrom: tests of pro- positional truth, 244-6 G The difficulty of testing intuitions by their propositions, is that intuitions are individual, ineffable, never adequately expressible in language, or material other than their own. Cf. ethics, religion, art, 246-8 H Truth within intuitions; aesthetic truth and truth to independent reality. Art (and moral) criticism, 248-50 I Moral values always individual and personal: ethical discussion is (necessary) generaliza- tion and moral philosophers easily mistake shadow for substance, 250-3 J Can art be 'true' to independent reality? The range of arts makes an answer difficult. At one end drama may be 'true', but what of a fugue? 253-5 K Reasons pro and con. Psycho- analysis. The fact that drama and music are both art, and the futility of 'sheer emotion' theories, may support a positive answer, notwithstanding great difficulties, 255-6 L Conclusion. The philosopher needs to attend more to individual intuitions, as part of his data. But further: the imaginative synthesis required in individual intuitions, is an essential corrective of over-abstraction, leading a little nearer to scientia intuitiva, 250-8 RHEES, R. I Science and politics, Symposium, Suppl. XXIII (1949), pp. 129-40 Synopsis: A The difference between the power of government and other power. It is idle to try to justify government, 129 B The state acts with the forces it controls, 130-1 C The influence of government in a society is never just the influence of the party in power, 132 D Ruling is not management, either of the affairs of a class or of society's affairs, 133 E Conflicts among social movements may be called social problems. But not problems of co-ordination. And there is no sense in asking for the 'right' solution of them, 134-5 F This also is a political problem: whether the course proposed is really a furtherance of the cause, or an abandoning of it. Such questions require political judgment: understanding what the issues are, or seeing what is at stake. You need political judgment to see conflicts and affinities among ways of living, 135-6 G Historical study and the understanding of social affairs: of value not merely for generalizations about political tendencies. Difference between extent and depth of historical knowledge. Learn- ing from history and learning from the lives of individuals, 138 H Predictions from tendencies of institutions are untrustworthy as often as not. Reasons why the growth of historical knowledge will hardly alter this, 139 I For deciding political problems a sense of the issues at stake is more important than predictions are. There can be no general way of deciding political or social problems, and so no science of their solution, 140 RICHARDS, I. A.

D. 1 The atomic theory as metaphysics and as science, Vol. XLV (1944-45), pp. 71-88 Synopsis: A The theory of atoms and empty space, as, in origin, metaphysical, and not scientific (as its rival, infinite divisibility and plenum); this, because it is based on distin- guishing appearance and reality, and arguing that reality must be such or such in spite of appearances, 71-5 B For example, the arguments of Lucretius, 75-80 C Atomic theory could not become scientific until chemistry had developed notions of specific properties and quantitative analysis, 80-3 D Dalton made the final step by applying it to the chemical combination of gases and verifying his deductions, 83-5 E In becom- ing scientific the theory provides a guide to experiment and a criterion of accuracy.

XXII (1948), pp. 79-106 Synopsis: A There is such a thing as independent emotive meaning, and ethical words have it, 79-80 B Objection taken to the latter statement by all who hold that it is what the words describe that has the emotive effect, not the words. Weakness of this position, 81-3 C Ethical words are not without a descriptive use. They are used (erroneously) by objectivists in ethics, to name this or that simple unanalyzable attribute, 83-4 D As against this view, the adherent of the emotive theory is a subjectivist, 84-5 E It is a subjectivism, however, which would treat ethical words, as e.g., Sir David Ross does aesthetic, 85-9 F Yet there is a significance in the resistance against this procedure, i.e., against allowing a word like, e.g. 'good' to indicate 'whatever evokes anybody's approval'. It testifies to the practical force in the word, 89-90 G Unlike descriptive meaning, emotive meaning resists change; and there are not emotive synonyms, as there are descriptive, 90-1 H The effect of redefining the descriptive function of an emotive word, 91-4 I To find that such a word as 'right', 'obligation', 'duty', etc., is descriptive of no fact, is not to repudiate its emotive meaning, 94-6 J 'But is there not a connexion, in such words, between their descriptive and their emotive functions'? answered, 96-9 K Some further arguments against the emotive theory considered: namely, the arguments (i) from 'What we mean', (ii) from the fact of ethical disagreements, (iii) from illusion.

(SIR (WILLIAM) DAVID ROSS) 1 Platonic philosophy and Aristotelian metaphysics, Symposium, Suppl. V (1925), pp. 145-57 Synopsis: A The question of the separate existence of Ideas-respective views of Plato and Aristotle, and the merits of these views, 145-51 B The ideas are not, as More says, 'a spiritual world', 151 C Nor can Aristotle be truly said to be more rationalistic than Plato, 151-5 D God and immortality-the respective views of Plato and Aristotle, 155-7 2 Is there a Moral End? Symposium, Suppl. VIII (1928), pp. 90-8 Synopsis: A Why not the expression 'means and end', provided it is recognized that there are other ends than pleasure? 90 B Because we do not actually judge right to be right on account of the good it secures, 91-2 C This clearest in the case of duties of perfect obligation, 92-4 D Apparent exceptions (duties of imperfect obligation) are not really exceptions, 94-5 E 'Absolute' duties. Problem of their apparent conflict. How we usually solve it, 95-6 F 'Not means-to-end but end-in-itself' criticized, 96-7 G Criticism of 'self-realization' as an expression of the nature of moral action, 97-8 3 The nature of morally good action, Vol. XXIX (1928-29), pp. 251-74 Synopsis: A A morally good action is not the doing of a right act, but an action from a good motive, 251-3 B The sense of duty the best motive, but there are other good motives, e.g. the desire for another's welfare, 253-5 C Motives may co-operate, but a motive may be present and yet not modify action, 255-6 D The co-operation of another good motive with sense of duty makes an action not less good but better, 256-60 E No need to suppose the sense of duty operates without rousing desire, or is in necessary conflict with desire, or is less strong when there is no conflict, 260-3 F Does not the goodness of all good action depend on a common characteristic? Suggested that it is always motivated by the desire to bring into being something good, 264-5 G Two apparent exceptions, (i) desire to do one's duty, and (ii) desire for pleasure for oneself, 265-6 H The second leads to the suggestion that self-sacrifice is the essence of all good action, selfishness the essence of all bad. Difficulties involved in this, 266-7 I Suggested that seeking some good other than one's own pleasure is the essence of all good action. In conscientious action what we aim at is the doing of duty, which is not a good: but this involves the thought that a good will be brought into being, 267-8 J One's own pleasure being as good as anyone else's, why is the seeking of it not morally good? This may be answered by saying that seeking it as a good is morally good, seeking it as pleasure 0158</page><page sequence="163">RUSSELL Ross, W. D. (Sir (William) David Ross)-continued for oneself neutral, 268-70 K 'Disinterested malevolence' is not a difficulty, because the will to inflict pain is either not disinterested or not malevolence, 270-1 L We can now say that what is morally bad is the pursuit of something simply qua pleasant, at the cost of seeking what is good, 271-2 M Good action is either action intended to produce something good or action from sense of duty which involves the thought of something good to be produced. Thus the action is motivated either by the thought of one's own pleasure or of a good to be produced or of a duty to be done, 272-4 4 The coherence theory of goodness, Symposium, Suppl. X (1931), pp. 61-70 Synopsis: A A preliminary consideration of the coherence theory of truth. This may mean (i) that 'truth' and 'coherence' are names for the very same thing; (ii) that truth is based on coherence, by coherence being meant (a) consistency or (b) necessitation. Objections to these, 61-2 B A coherence theory of goodness corresponding to any of these is open to corresponding objections, 62-3 C Professor Paton's view is different; it is that good- ness depends on an action being consistent with, or assisting the fulfilment of many potentialities or (better) of many desires, 63-5 D Suggested the actions are good if they are done from (i) the desire to bring into existence some pleasure for another or (ii) the desire to bring some good into existence, or (iii) the desire to do one's duty. Actions of many of these kinds will in fact tend to the fulfilment of many desires, 65-6 E But to say they are good because they do this is to make good action merely instrumental to fulfilment of desire, instead of being good (as Professor Paton maintains) because of the nature of its motive, 66-7 F Difficulties in equating the discharge of special obligations with the carrying out of a consistent policy, 67-8; G and in making moral improvement not an end but a means to the fulfilment of desire, 69-70 5 Some thoughts on Aristotle's Logic, Vol. XL (1939-40), pp. i-xviii Synopsis: A Aristotle is justified in claiming to be the first systematic logician, i-ii B His interest in logic, practical in the Topics, becomes more theoretical in the Analytics, ii-iv C The theory of syllogism was suggested, not by Plato's 'division', but by his doctrine that the presence of a specific nature in a thing brings with it the presence of the generic nature; Aristotle draws the logical consequence of Plato's metaphysical doctrine, v-vii D In accepting valid moods of the first figure, Aristotle appeals only to the form of the premisses, and becomes the founder of symbolic logic. In rejecting invalid moods, he appeals to experience; in accepting valid moods of the second and third figures, to imagina- nlon, viii-xii E Explanation of his failure to recognize fundamental principles for the second and third figures, answering to the dictum de omni et nullo for the first, xii-xiv F He overemphasized syllogism because he failed to consider mathematical reasoning closely enough; but he was justified in treating it as the starting-point of the logic of in- ference, xiv-xvi G Syllogism defended against the charge of being a petitio principii, xvii-xviii RUSSELL, B. A. W. (THE EARL RUSSELL) 2 On the nature of truth, Vol. VII (1906-07), pp. 28-49 Synopsis: A The preamble, 28 B The idealistic view that truth is the whole entails that only the whole truth is quite true, 29-30 C Some difficulties. If no partial truth is quite true, this that is being stated is not quite true-being a partial truth, 30 D What does the monist mean by a whole? 31 E Error. No evidence that a system of false propositions could not cohere as well as does the whole which the truth is, 32-4 F The monistic theory's appeal to experience, and its use of the deus ex machina, 34-7 G The axiom of internal relations. Some consequences of it, 37-8 H Meaning of the axiom, 38-9 I Two grounds in its favour examined, 40-1 J Grounds against it: (i) It permits a subject and its 'nature', neither to be identified nor to be distinguished. (ii) It is incompatible with all complexity, 41-4 K Truth as the quality of beliefs which have facts for their objects, falsehood as the quality of other beliefs, 44-5 L Two views of truth, one which accepts objective falsehoods and one which rejects them, 45-9 3 Knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description, Vol. XI (1910-11), pp. 108-28 Synopsis: A When we know a proposition about 'the so-and-so' what is it that we know? 108 B We know an object by acquaintance when the object is directly before the mind, 108-9; C as, e.g., sense-data and (probably) ourselves, 109-Il; D also, universals, 111-12; E but not physical objects or other minds than our own, 112 F Our prob- lem: what is the nature of the knowledge we have of an object, when we are not acquainted with it but only know its (definite) description, namely, that it is 'the so-and-so'? We reply, it is the knowledge that the properties named (and with which we are acquainted) belong to one existent object and to no more, 112-14 G Some of the objects which I only know in this way, namely people other than myself, 114-16 H The sort of propositions we should like to make about such objects but cannot, namely propositions in which the object itself is a constituent, and which are composed wholly of constituents with which 0159</page><page sequence="164">RUSSEL Russell, B. A. W. (The Earl Russell)-continued we are acquainted; these alone being the kind of propositions we can understand, 116-17; I the reason being that they alone are the kind of propositions we can intelligently suppose. (We cannot intelligently judge or suppose, and not know what about.) 117-19 J The fallacious view that when I judge about an object, what is actually present to my mind (what, therefore, I know) is the idea of it, 119-20 K How we must express what is actually present to my mind when I judge about an object by its proper name. A descrip- tive phrase must be introduced and it must be broken up, 120-1 L A logical-parallel to the above epistemological-argument. The particular denoted by a definitely-descriptive phrase is not a constituent of a judgment involving the phrase, except when the particular happens to be 'I' or 'this', the only two strictly proper names of particulars, 121-7 M Summary, 127-8 4 On the relations of universals and particulars, Vol. XII (1911-12), pp. 1-24 Synopsis: A The tentative nature of the ensuing discussion, 1 B The different opposi- tions to be noted: (i) (psychological) of percept and concept, 1-2; C (ii) (metaphysical) of things in time and things not, 2-3; D and (iii) (logical) of (a) relations and entities other than relations, and (,8) the objects corresponding to verbs and those corresponding to substantives, 3-5 E Is the object of the intransitive verb a relation (of predication) holding between a subject and a predicate? Is there truly a relation of predication at all? 5-6 F Both the analysis of a 'thing' and certain considerations concerning spatio-temporal diversity, would seem to combine to show that there is an ultimate, simple, asymmetrical relation called predication. Two rival analyses of 'thing', one suggesting universals and particulars, the other universals only, 6-8 G Rejection of the suggestion (Berkeley and Hume) that there are particulars only, 8-10 H But particulars exist. The argument in outline. If there are two qualitatively identical patches, then what is qualitatively one is in two places; thus showing that there are two particulars, qualified, each similarly to the other, 10-11 I The places are two. True, they are in perceptual space; but even there, if there is a spatial relation between them, they must be two, 10-14 J The argument in more detail. If the patches were in absolute space, the duality would be undeniable. What, then, makes them necessarily still two, even in perceived space? Not any difference of shape (they would be two even without that) but their being outside of one another. If they were one (as they would if the universal alone existed) this one would have to be something that was outside of itself, 14-19 K A supporting line of argument. When two people believe the same statement, what makes their beliefs two? Not any difference of their general qualities (for they would still be two without that) but their being in different relations to particulars. If they were one, then the relations each has to the other would have to be relations which he had to himself. What really are, therefore, are instances of one, not one, 19-20 L The oppositions we began with, and this opposition; how it validates them, 21-4 5 On the notion of cause, Vol. XIII (1912-13), pp. 1-26 Synopsis: A The 'law of causality' as usually stated: a criticism, 1-9 B Some fallacies which are attributable to the analogy supposed to hold between cause and volition, 9-12 C What is the nature of the laws or law really employed by scientists? First, science agrees that it is cause-effect if a certain sequence has been very often observed and never found to fail, but it treats the future continuation of the sequence as probably only, 12-13; D and, secondly, it does not assert of every event that it has a cause like this. Moreover, it will treat any sequence (e.g. day and night) which is observed sufficiently uniformly as cause and effect; while, fourthly, as it develops it tends to resolve the cause-effect relation- ship into simply an empirically-observed functional relation between events, 13-14 E Such fundamental relationship (i) is no 'necessity of thought', (ii) makes past determine future in no sense in which the reverse is not also true, (iii) is empirically verifiable only in a relatively 'isolated system', and (iv) is expressive of an assumed principle of the per- manence of laws in nature, 15-16 F The empirically verifiable inexact laws exhibited in the behaviour of a relatively isolated system, versus non-verifiable exact laws exhibited throughout nature, 16-18 G The meaning of viewing the universe as a deterministic system, 18-24 H Determinism and freedom, 24-6 I Summary, 26 6 The nature of the state in view of its external relations, Symposium, Vol. XVI (1915-16), pp. 301-10 Synopsis: A How the state came by its prestige in the eyes of philosophers, 301-2 B The state exists as a means of power to some of the people, and of safety to the rest, 302 C A man's feeling towards the state depends on how far he feels himself one of those in power in it, 302-3 D Two evils in states. Tyranny of the empowered and rebellion of the others, 303 E The added safety which comes to people from living in a state. It is due to their having pooled their forces under a central directorate, 303 F Eventually, all the world's forces should be so pooled, 303-4 G What has prevented this, 304-5 H Political obligation.

It would frequently force the best people, against their insight, to further the purposes of others more commonplace, who were in office, 306-7 J Every existing state suffers (i) from internal injustice, 307; K (ii) from the fact that it is less than world-wide, 307-8; L and (iii) from having to interfere with liberty, 308-9 M Summary, 309-10 7 On propositions: what they are and how they mean, Suppi. II (1919), pp. 1-43 Synopsis: A A 'fact' is anything complex. So, it has constituents. Its constituents have positions in it, 1-2 B Facts have 'the same form' when they do not differ otherwise than in constituents; and when, if one fact has its constituents changed, another results, 2 C We are considering here, facts having only three constituents (two terms and a-dyadic- relation, 2-3 D Given a fact of three constituents, there always must be other facts of three constituents, which differ from the first, not only in constituents, but in form, i.e. which differ in quality, or as positive from negative. There are two such possible forms. In a given case, one of the two must be a fact; and then the other cannot be, 3-4 E The (baseless) prejudice that no fact of negative quality can really be a fact, 4-6 F How a proposition means, is first a question of how its several words mean, 6-7 G Possibly the meaning of, e.g., the uttered word 'John' is just the causes and effects of the utterance, and so is something non-mental. Watson's behaviourist view, here 7-10 H Valid objection to this view. Watson's denial of images is not tenable. Introspection, of which consciousness of images is part, cannot be denied, 10-12 I Why behaviourists and others have denied introspection, as a method, 11-14 J It cannot be denied, either because of its data's privacy, 12; K or because of their independence of physical laws, 12-14 L A difficulty in the behaviourist theory which seems not insuperable, namely, words in the absence of their objects, 15-19 M The meaning of 'meaning' (whether of words or of images). A word is not like (as an image is like) what it means. Meaning of words as seem (i) in their demonstrative, and (ii) in their narrative use. The latter not explicable in behaviouristic terms, 19-22 N The way of memory and the way of imagination are two ways in which words mean in their narrative or 'thinking' use, 22 O And what is meant by this 'meaning' is a question of the nature of the 'meaning' that images have, 22 P Images mean what they mean, by resembling it, 22-3 Q What it will be that they mean depends on the sort of causal efficacy they have. An image having some of the effects of a glass of wine will be 'of' it on that account, 23-4 R Belief. The supposed 'act' of believing (as opposed to what is believed) seems to be only a logical construction we make, not any part of the world we find, 24-6 S Since the 'meaning' of an image is its likeness to something past (something therefore, remembered) and since memory involves belief, the meaning of the 'meaning' of images is partly a question of the nature of belief, 26-7 T I now think that sensations and i-mages suitably related are a sufficient stuff out of which to compose beliefs, 27-36 U A proposition is (usefully) definable as 'the content of a belief', once we know what a belief is, 28 V All content of belief is (as with memory) images, 28-9 W As a proposition, this content may be a word-proposition, but usually the word-proposition 'means' an image-proposition. The latter has an objective reference dependent on the meanings of its constituent images, 29-30 X What actually constitutes believing? In believing, I am having a certain feeling, 30-1 Y As the causal-efficacy view of believing (itself not tenable) suggests, belief is any one of various feelings which can attach to a proposition; one (an important one) being assent, 31-2 Z In assent we have (i) the feeling, in (ii) a certain relation to (iii) the (images in the) proposition. The images alone are not enough, 32-6 AA Belief. How is its content related to the fact which makes it true or false?

But this use of conceptual organization is often regarded as a distortion of the concrete facts; and the danger is stressed, of resting in an account of the facts which is intellectually satisfying.

On the logical views of the physicalists, if p then q is true whenever p is false, 188-90 Q Thus 'under such and such circumstances a reporter would report m' is true whenever these circumstances are not realized. But this involves that a hypothetical proposition is significant only when it is actually being verified, 188-90 R This restricts the physicalist to actual reports.

IX (1929), pp. 80-96 Synopsis: We can know negative facts, so Mr. Mabbott, in so far as he denies this, is wrong. But he is right in resisting certain erroneous views about 'not', though wrong in concluding that therefore 'No' is (as a rule) an expression only of doubt or ignorance. Information to the effect that something is not so-and-so does not tell us all that there is to be known about it or, usually, all that we want to know about it. But it does tell us something about it. In this inquiry the negative judgments that we examine should be genuine ones, namely proper answers to proper questions, such that either they or their contradictories are true. Some proper questions themselves embody 'not'. Now, very often, when I give a negative reply to a proper question I can say 'It is not so-and-so but some other colour (or shape or size, etc.)'. This rider is often gratuitous since it is understood. What is denied to charac- terize the subject is denied as one determinate of a determinable, some determinate of which must characterize it (though it may not be known which). This suggests that the negative reply should be construed as only indirectly characterizing the subject, directly characterizing the wanted character of that subject as being one of the determinates 0166</page><page sequence="171">RYLE Ryle, G.-continued of that determinable other than the mentioned one. To say that something is not of a given colour is to assert that its colour is one of the colours other than that given colour. In considering a specimen of negative judgment, it is instructive to notice which expres- sion in it would be accented in speech; i.e. which element the 'not' controls. 'J'ones is not the secretary of the Club (but someone else is)' is different from 'Jones is not the secretary of the Club (but holds some other office). But Mr. Mabbott holds that disjunctive judgments about particular subjects must be nonsense. Particulars cannot be either ... or . . ., since to say that they are so, is to say that they are neither ... nor . . . But this view cannot be maintained. To say that some- thing has one of a set of characters (without saying which one) is not to say that it has none of them. But it is to say something only indirectly about it, by saying something directly about the character that it has, namely that it is a member of this set. There are difficulties in applying this analysis to negative existential propositions, as well as to the negative teleological propositions, to which Mr. Mabbott gives a privileged place. 2 Are there Propositions? Vol. XXX (1929-30), pp. 91-126 Synopsis: The theory that truths and falsehoods are substances is now dead. But it still merits an inquest. It had been championed by Bolzano, Husserl, Meinong, and Frege. One of its sources was Brentano's doctrine that all mental acts have objects, and that judging is a mental act. Judgments of different people and different dates can have the same truth or falsehood for their common object. A second source was anti-psychologism. The truths found or sought for by scientists, mathematicians and logicians are not intro- spectibles as the idea-epistemologists in effect maintained. A third source was the applica- tion of meaning-theories to sentences, as distinct from separate words. In understanding a sentence we are knowing its meaning, which must therefore be there to be known by anyone. A fourth source was the desire to establish a field for logic to be the science of. The theory is unplausible. A Platonic status for falsehoods is too honorific. But it is also epistemologically useless, amounting as it does to a sort of Platonized representationalism. There are difficulties about the relations between these supposed substances and the things and people that they may be about. Moreover, reference to any specific truth or falsehood involves mentioning some linguistic items. So sentences are not names; propositions, true or false are not substances. Knowing is contrasted with merely thinking. What is known is a fact. But thinking that something is the case, even when it happens to be correct, is not knowing that it is the case. An ingredient common to the various kinds of thinking is entertaining or thinking-of- as. The activity of thinking of anything seems to involve the employment of symbols or other 'presentatives'. When thinking of something as being so-and-so, when I do not know it to be so-and-so, I am combining words, say, into sentences with the guise of the sentences I should employ if I were telling something that I knew to be the case. Under- standing such a would-be statement-of-fact is knowing what would have to be the case for it to be a statement of fact. The meaning of a statement of knowledge is the fact known. The meaning of a statement of what is merely thought to be the case is, instead, the if-then fact about this statement, that it would be a statement-of-fact, if and only if so-and-so were the case. 3 Systematically misleading expressions, Vol. XXXII (1931-32), pp. 139-70 Synopsis: There is something very odd in the programme of giving philosophical analyses of the meanings of terms. For if we know what these terms mean, no elucidation seems necessary; and if we do not, we are in no position to give elucidations of them. However, there does remain an elucidatory task which for certain special theoretical purposes needs to be executed. Some expressions though efficiently and unperplexedly employed in ordinary life, are of constructions which suggest that their logic is other than it is, namely when these constructions are normally or ideally dedicated to the expression of propositions of certain logical forms, but are exceptionally borrowed for the expression of propositions of quite different logical forms. Thus, the verb 'exists', and with it adjec- tives like 'existent', 'real', 'unreal', 'imaginary', 'abstract', and many others, appear, from their grammar, to be doing what normal predicates do, namely ascribing to a subject of predication some character or other. But this appearance is delusive. 'Exists', and the rest, are not, in the required way, predicates; and their grammatical subjects are not, in the required way, subjects of predication. 'Mr. Pickwick is a fiction' or 'did not exist' is not an extra item of information or misinformation about a man. It says that there was no such person; there was no one having the name and other attributes that Dickens pretended did belong to someone. So 'Mr. Pickwick is a fiction' is systematically misleading, where 'there was no one who had all these properties' is non-misleading. Statements with abstract nouns for their nominatives are misleading in a different way. 'Unpunctuality is reprehen- sible' does not say, though it is constructed as if it said, that besides some reprehensible children and adults there is a Platonic something else which is also reprehensible. It says, roughly, that anyone who is unpunctual deserves reproof for being so. It is, therefore, a general proposition about people and is not a singular proposition about a 'universal'. 0167</page><page sequence="172">RYLE Ryle, G.-continued Descriptive phrases of the pattern 'the so and so' are not, in general, misleading, though erroneous accounts of them have been given, accounts, e.g., which construe such phrases as proper names, or which try to identify the person or thing (if any) described, with what the descriptive phrase means-as if people or mountains could be meanings. Other accounts neglect the important differences between a 'the' phrase referentially used and the same phrase used purely predicatively. But some 'the' phrases are systematically misleading, since they do not function, though they seem to function, either as mentions of subjects of predication or as predicates. Some philosophical myths arise out of construing phrases like 'the meaning of--' and 'the concept or idea of-' as functioning after the manner of 'the brother of' etc. This notion of the suitability and unsuitability of the constructions of sentences, to the logical forms of the propositions which they express, is intimately connected with the nature of philosophical puzzles and of the solution of them by philosophical argumentation. So some and perhaps all philosophizing is concerned with forms of words. 4 Phenomenology, Suppl. XI (1932), pp. 68-83 Synopsis: (1) The word 'phenomenology' derives from Brentano's demand that psychology should study psychic 'phenomena'. The antithesis is not that of appearances versus realities or noumena, but that of actualities, psychic ones, versus powers or faculties. (2) The distinction between the psychology and the phenomenology of these phenomena, indicated by Bretano but developed and labelled by Husserl, was the distinction between the empirical study of the manifestations of consciousness and the conceptual or apriori study of their types. 'Phenomenology' is thus a new name for what has always been a considerable part of philosophy, though Husserl claims that it is a new science. This programme need not have led Husserl, though it in fact did lead him, to a sort of monadological metaphysic. Nor need his execution of it have involved him, though it did involve him, in speaking as if this and other apriori conceptual inquiries rested on a special sort of intuition of essences. Brentano's doctrines (a) that consciousness is essentially intentional, i.e. of some object or 'accusative' and (b) that there are just three irreducibly different dimensions of 'accusa- tivity', became the prime axioms of Hussel's phenomenology. In the end he virtually concluded that the being of everything, save the conscious self, was its being accusative to some conscious act or other. So phenomenology becomes the science of sciences. But the underlying doctrine of intentionality, with its consequential apparatus of intentional accusatives, is objectionable, as is Husserl's rider that in 'immanent perception' we know our own acts for what they are, while in 'transcendent perception' we do not know other things for what they are. 5 Imaginary Objects. Symposium, Suppl. XII (1933), pp. 18-43 Synopsis: In the sense in which 'exists' is not a predicate, 'is imaginary' is not a predicate. The grammatical subject to 'exists' and 'is imaginary' is not used to name or designate a person, thing or happening; it functions only predicatively. 'Sea serpents are imaginary monsters' says 'there are no such monsters as sea serpents', though it says more than this. So, in one sense of 'about', the statement is not about some sea serpents, though its grammar tempts one to construe it as if it were. The nominatives of sentences of the pattern '- is imaginary' are only pseudo-designations. There is no individual of whom Dickens' statements in Pickwick Papers are true history or false history; he just pretended that there was one. We understand these statements, since we know what would have been the case, had they been true. When readers of Pickwick Papers discuss what happened to Mr. Pickwick they are discussing what the book says; they settle disagreements by consulting the text. When we say 'Pickwick is an imaginary entity', we are saying that the seeming designation 'Mr. Pickwick', as it occurs in the book, is a pseudo-designation. An analogous account holds good of the creatures of our fancy when we are romancing not in words but in pictures in the mind's eye. To say that something is imaginary is to say more than that there is nothing of that description; it is to allude to someone imagining. What is it to imagine? All imagining is imagining-that . .. Not all imagining involves having images. We can imagine some- thing not known, or known not to be the case; and we can romance either about Napoleon or about Mr. Pickwick. We can call Dickens' imagining 'constructive', and that of his readers 're-constructive'. The sense in which Dickens was creative is not that he created a man but that he created a story. The epistemological question 'What is the object of imagining?' is ambiguous; none of the answers to the different questions so worded entails that imaginary objects enjoy a queer kind of being. All imagining is story-telling, in one form or another. Pickwick Papers as a whole is a sort of composite predicate, which does not in fact characterize someone or something, but pretends to do so. The fact that a romance may convey general truths about human nature does not modify its fictitiousness as a narrative. 0168</page><page sequence="173">RYLE Ryle, G.-continued 6 Internal Relations, Symposium Suppl. XIV (1935), pp. 154-72 Synopsis: The doctrine that all relations are internal was, perhaps, originally, Bradley's counterblast to Herbart's monadology. The doctrine can be construed in different ways. (i) It might be construed as saying that relations are essential (versus accidental) to the other characters of the related terms. One character is essential to another, when unless something has the former, it logically cannot have the latter. Some characters, relational and non- relational, are thus 'internal' to some others. But some are 'external' or accidental to some others. There is no valid argument for the general conclusion that a thing's relations are in this way essential to all its other characters. On the contrary, some of the thing's relations are demonstrably not the logical sine qua non of some of its other relational or non-relational characters. On this interpretation, intemality and externality are the logical dependence and independence of one character on another character. A character of a thing cannot, in this use, be external or internal to the thing, but only to another character of that thing. (ii) The doctrine might be construed as saying that if A is in a given relation to B then A would not be A, if it were not in that relation to B. But the predicate-end of the apodosis 'A would not be A' is illegitimate. Whether it is supposed to mean 'A would not be identical with A' or to mean 'A would not be A' we have to retort that there is no such predicate. The question 'is A A?' or 'is A identical with A?' are spurious questions. A proper name cannot be a predicate, and while there are significant assertions and denials of identity, these cannot employ the subject's name over again to signify what the subject is asserted or denied to be identical with. Some people confuse with one or other of these doctrines the quite different doctrine that whatever exists or happens is causally conditioned by everything else that exists or happens. Nothing that is the case could, causally, have been the case had anything else in the universe been in any way different. The universe is 'one big clock'. This could be argued for only on experimental evidence. In fact our belief that special causal laws are discoverable carries with it the belief that things are causally connected with specifiable other things and therefore not with all other things; i.e. lots of specific causal independences are established pari passu with the establishment of any given specific causal dependence. The notion of causal dependence and independence still needs scrutiny. It is not definable in terms of logical entailment. Husserl fails to account for the differences between silly and sensible expectations. The theory that causal laws are not true or false but rules for judging fails, for partly similar reasons. 7 Induction and hypothesis, Symposium, Suppl. XVI (1937), pp. 36-62 Synopsis: Induction is not deduction, but inductive truths are not therefore miraculous or fortuitous. It is undesirable to stigmatize them all as mere 'hypotheses', or to tie up the problem of induction with that of prediction. How can arguments from empirical data establish laws? Because these arguments are probable arguments. Three notions of probability need to be distinguished: (a) plausibility, (b) numerical odds, (c) inductive reliability. The last is not to be assimilated to the second. Questions of the numerical odds are settled by counting and by calculation; but news about the world cannot be derived from arithmetic. The arithmetic of numerical odds can be directly applied to the world, e.g. in gambling, only when it has been found out experimentally that the alternative chances are equi-reliable. But this notion is that, not of odds but of expectability, i.e. the third notion of probability. The notion of 'by chance' involves that of causal independence, and we establish hosts of causal independences for each causal dependence that is established. The question of the justification of induction is confused. It is sometimes posed as a question of our title to infer from small numbers of observed instances to large or infinite numbers of un- observed instances. This is wrong. The question is of our title to argue from a finite number of instances to a law. A law is not a compendium of further instances. It might hold without there happening to exist any more instances. The question what makes one inductive argument stronger than another is a soluble question. The cogency of an induc- tive argument is a function of three things: the degree of deviation from chance, the stability of this deviation, and the density of observed instances. But can a law be definitely established? Inductive arguments are not operations with inverse probabilities. Numerical odds are used, not as a premiss, but only as a measure. 8 Categories, Vol. XXXVIII (1937-38), pp. 189-206 There are close connexions between theories of categories and theories of types. Aris- totle's categories were the radical types of the (primarily) predicate terms of simple, singular propositions. Differences of category corresponded with different interrogatives, and Aristotle's categories were named after these interrogatives. Kant's categories had next to nothing to do with Aristotle's. They were derived from what Kant thought were the radical ways in which propositions can differ from one another in logical form. The titles 'Quantity', 'Quality' and 'Relation', though employed by Kant and Aristotle, were employed Q169</page><page sequence="174">RYLE Ryle, G.-continued for entirely disparate purposes. Kant's roster of propositional forms was quite ardficial; but he was right, as against Aristotle, to connect category-differences with differences of logical form. This last point can be generalized. The connexions between the sub-expressions, whether simple or complex, into which a sentence can be cut up, and the remainder of that sentence, are subject not only to grammatical rules but also to rules of co-significance. Many grammatically allowable combinations of expressions make nonsense. The category or type to which an expression belongs is the set of conditions of co-significance, that sentences incorporating it have to satisfy. Two expressions are of the same category when (roughly) a full sentence significantly embodying one of them could, still significantly, embody the other in its stead. Although in ordinary situations we know in practice how to avoid constructing absurd combinations of expressions, there are occasions on which we get into logical troubles through not knowing, as a matter of theory, how to avoid doing this. Philosophy is con- cerned with theoretical problems of this kind. Philosophical arguments are acts of deliber- ately exhibiting the formal or logical properties, and therefore the categories or types, of expressions which can be built into significant or absurd sentences. Hence the notion of philosophical analysis, if construed as mere paraphrase, misses out the cardinal thing. 9 Knowing how and knowing that, Vol. XLVI (1945-6), pp. 1-16 For a practical or theoretical activity to be intelligent or skilful etc., it is often supposed that there must occur at least two activities: namely one of doing, guided by another activity of considering what is to be done. Since the latter is a contemplative activity, a third bridge-activity is often postulated which is both executive enough to get things done and contemplative enough to appreciate what is to be done. This is all false. Acting intel- ligently cannot require both consideration and execution, since considering is something which can itself be intelligently or stupidly conducted. Adverbs like 'cleverly' signify the modus operandi of an activity, not its being escorted by another, meditative, activity. Knowing how to do something is not reducible to knowing that certain propositions are true. A man cannot be made clever at something by being supplied with information- and this holds good not only for activities like chess but also for intellectual activities like reasoning. Rules and maxims of procedure can, very often, be abstracted from effective modi operandi; formulated and taught as lessons to novices. But the operations ante-dated the formulations; and memorization of the rules does not suffice for mastery of the operations. Moreover, such things as canons and principles even when formulated, are verbally couched not as statements but as instructions. They are not, therefore, the sorts of thing that could be true or false, or known (-that). As knowing-how cannot be reduced to knowing-that, so teaching-how and learning-how cannot be reduced to teaching-that and learning-that. Teaching-how must be distinguished from sheer drilling or conditioning. Skills are not sheer habits. Operating skilfully entails using one's head, though it does not entail executing a secondary operation of considering propositions. So far from knowing-how being reducible to knowing-that, knowing-that presupposes knowing-how. To have found out that something is the case, I must have investigated intelligently; and I must also be capable of exploiting what I have learned. 10 Why are the calculuses of logic and arithmetic applicable to reality? Symposium, Suppl. XX (1946), pp. 20-29 There are several different ways in which a rule of inference can be said to be applied. A closed hypothetical proposition is an application of a corresponding open hypothetical proposition, in the sense of being a specification of it. But in quite a different sense, a person who draws an actual conclusion from actual premisses is applying or observing the corresponding rule of inference. He is doing what the rule licences him to do. Both these uses of 'apply' differ from that in which a description of a wanted man applies to or fits him. A rule of inference can be specified in a correspondingly closed hypothetical proposition; and it can be observed by someone who infers in accordance with it. The rule of inference does not also fit anything, as a description may fit things. It is a performance- rule; and tells us how to operate, not that something is the case. It does not describe or depict the structure of reality. But we do find out about reality partly by inferring. There are different sorts of performance-rules, both in logic and elsewhere. Some are procrustean, others are more like canons. The former mark off legitimate from illegitimate operations; the latter mark off more effective from less effective operations. Principles of induction are of the latter type. There are no inductive fallacies. Operating in accord- ance with rules, principles or canons entails knowing them, but it does not entail separate operations of considering them in abstracto. Working with care and skill is different from moving by rote; but the difference does not consist in the occurrence of auxiliary operations of thinking about regulations or maxims. 0170</page><page sequence="175">SAW SALMON, C.

Symposium, Suppl. XII (1933), pp. 118-30 Synopsis: A It is in the nature of their subject that philosophers must disagree, 118 B This disagreement need not be a defect m philosophy--may be its glory, 118-19 C The sciences owe their agreement to their omissions, 119-20 D And what one omits another does not always cover. In fact there are big and important aspects of the real outwith the purview of every science; e.g. the idiosyncracies of personality, and what is 'subjective in experience, 120-1 E Thus the 'objective reality' of science is only part of our experience of reality, and so is factitious and fictitious, 121-2 F Since every science must dissect, none can give us the whole, 123-4 G If philosophy's business, after science, is to restore us the whole, it cannot itself make abstractions from persons' experence, but must consider personality in its integrity, perhaps finding in it the unifying principle of the whole, 124-5 H If the philosopher would read the whole, he must take personality as the key; and if he would comprehend previous philosophers he must take their personalities as the key to their systems, 125-6 I Thus (i) philosophy will be a very tolerant and elastic kind of a unity and (ii) the personal philosophies composing it will necessarily differ, though not in an unlimited way, 126-7 J Reasons why philoso- phies actually differ more than they need, 127-9 K If these reasons could be removed, obscurities would recede and the few great issues in philosophy would stand out clearly and simply, 129-30 SCOTT, J.

An alternative: division of the world into groups of adjacent nations, each group having, roughly, a mentality of its own, 272-5 G No nation can, of course, enter such a group, if it still needs external war in order to maintain its internal cohesion: this equally whether it be monarchical or ruled by successful revolutionaries, 275-6; H which seems to postulate, for stability, (i) industry made a public service, (ii) men's incomes equalized without reference to their work, and (iii) consequently, a system of compulsory labour for the community, 276-7 I Why it is not impossible, after the shock of war, that an ethics of communism should replace that of the plutocratic commercialism, which has supplanted hereditary feudalism, 277-8 SHEARMAN, A.

(1936), pp. 78-87 Synopsis: A Sense data. That there are sense data and that there are problems about them, 78 B Moore. Does his account protect the description of sense-data against the charge of tautology? 79-81 C A sense datum may still be something, though it be not anything existent, 81-3 D Language. An understanding of how we use the word sense datum involves consciousness of facts as well as of words, 83-4 E Are questions that seem to be about actual sense data really only about the equivalence of sentences? 85-7 SMITH, J. A.* 1 On feeling, Vol. XIV (1913-14), pp. 49-75 Synopsis: A 'Feeling'. What do we really mean by it? 49-50. B Where the current 'cognition, conation, feeling' classification fails us, 50-1 C What, then, is pleasant- painful? (i) Experience in its earliest, undifferentiated condition? (ii) A mode of mental activity co-ordinate with cognition and conation? (iii) A quale of other (rather than itself one of the) mental states? The unsatisfactory character of all of these, 51-6 D Yet we may take from them at least the negative (if still unsatisfactory) suggestion that by feeling we mean a less organized, less architectonic, and less substantive form of an experience which has these characters more pronouncedly; which, as we must note, is not view (i) over again, 56-9 E The suggestion that the answer (to our what?) is that there is no answer; seeing that feelings are among the simples of experience, 59-62; F they being those simples which (i) are states of the perceiver-the living perceiver-himself, and so (ii) are acts, 62-3 G What this psychic activity is, as distinct from physical movement. Stout, on it. Bradley. The 'consciousness' or 'perception' involved in it, 63-7 H But a conative consciousness is involved as well as this cognitive (perceptual) consciousness- 'individual', like it, 'and not universal'; or, as on this conative side it may also be called, 'economic and not ethical'. Is this, then, what is pleasant-painful? 67-8 I Doubtful sense of having lost here the unity of the subject of the 'pleasant-painful' attribute; the retaining or recovering of which means that the differences of such subject are to be taken as different degrees in the perfection of it, 68-70 J Resulting identification of feeling with perfection, and of pleasant feeling with feeling. (So far as there is pleasant feeling there is feeling and as far as there is feeling there is perfection.) This not paradox, but rationality, 70-2 K And the force of the question, 'What, then, about the reality of pain?' may be seen to lie in an indefensible criterion of 'reality', 72-5 2 Are the materials of sense affections of the mind? Symposium, Vol. XVII (1916-17), pp. 445-52 Synopsis: A Of what genus are Moore's 'presented sensations' a species? 445-7 B About sense-materials, we may ask if they are of the mind or of the body.

Vol. XVIII (1917-18), pp. 121-37 Synopsis: A Our theme. It falls within transcendental logic. That is, we are discussing some of the mental activities which lay down the substratum of the sciences, 121-3 B Our question. Is mathematical knowledge of intensity possible? The first problem. What knowledge do we call mathematical? What is mathematical knowing intrinsically, and apart from its object? Russell, Whitehead, Poincare, 123-30 C The next problem. About what 'intensity' are we raising the question whether it can be known mathe- matically? Our answer: an intensive whole is such an one as is multum, non multa, 130-1 D The intensive whole as something whose inner structure forbids its being known mathematically, 131-3 E The objection that some future mathematics may do what mathematics cannot do now, 133-4 F There is knowledge, genuine and progressive, of intensive wholes.

(i) They are not concepts-being both universals and objects of knowledge, 114-17; G and (ii) though even more distinct from other objects of knowledge than from concepts, they are theoretical-known, not made, 117-18 H But is the concept purel,y particular and practical, the category purely universal and theoretical?

And the same limited claim is all that can properly be made for the other impression-of the world's monistic character, 3-6 C How are we, in these circumstances, to judge of the issue itself? 6-7 D And what issue are we here being called on to decide? 7-8 E The issue admits of no compromise solution, and the case of each side is an arguable one, 9-12 F The element of surrender in the monistic position, e.g. surrender of individuality, 13-16 G Even personality spells multiplicity and must be surrendered, 16-18 H The monist's contemptus mundi, 18-20 1 The real as an absolute, exclusive of personality, 20-2 J The defence of pluralism, Croce, 22-4 8 Is the mind a compound substance? Symposium, Vol. XXVI (1925-26), pp. 255-62 Synopsis: A The problem. If something of man survives his bodily death, what-or what that is of human interest-are we to take it to be? Surviving in men's memories or in our influence on them, not enough.

VI (1926), pp. 127-31 Synopsis: A But has mind a place 'in' nature? And is there something characteristic of it, peculiar to it, and such as will illuminate its more detailed structure? 127-9 B Is 'mind' confined to man himself, or is it also in his environment? 129 C If the latter, is an empirical procedure the right one with which to approach the study? 130-1 10 The nature of 'objective mind', Symposium, Suppl.

It is rather a certain direction, 19 G It is (for individuals in community together) the way towards fullness of personal being, 19 H Two states (i) a more awake and aware, in which the way has greater appeal (indeed, is felt to be overwhelmingly beautiful and right) and (ii) a more somnolent in which it has less, 19-21 I The way as the reverse of ascetic, 21-2 J Besides heightened awareness, e.g. in sense-perception and in bodily action, it includes delight, awe, self-surrender to the object and self-transcendence in it; also the sense that something more than I is acting through me.

But it sees more, including values not presented to the less clear consciousness, 34-5 S It has its need of criticism, of course. But even if criticism led (as it does not) to a denial of the mature values, it would only thereby stultify itself, 35-6 T And if this argument has often been urged in defence of theism, we must remember that it was a theism not yet discriminated from the way, 36 U The minimum meaning of the way's being 'right universally'; viz.: that it is the way of the fully-developed, unperverted conscious being, 37 V No presumptuousness involved in the assurance that it is so, 37-8 W The objectivity of 'developed', here, and therefore of 'unperverted', 38-9 X Non-necessity of theism.

The verb to be raises problems as to kinds of being, 582-4 B Sub- sistent and existent. The former as having logical being and the latter as having being which is either (i) real (causally efficacious) or unreal, 585-7 C Tabular statement of the kinds of being, 586 D Images.

Symposium, Vol. XX (1919-20), pp. 281-7 Synopsis: A Mental activity. That the act of thought is mental never proves the object men- tal, 281-2 B Universals and truth. If every general notion is allowed its corresponding non-mental and subsistent universal, must truth and illusion become indistinguishable? 282-3 C Universals as non-physical, non-mental, objective entities, 283-7 D The concept. A concept is not a tertium quid between the mental act and the universal, 285-6 E The axiologically-neutral character of the universal as compared with the Platonic EL6og, 286-7 5 Universals and Professor Whitehead's theory of objects, Vol. XXV (1924-25), pp. 305-30 Synopsis: A Whitehead's 'event' and 'object' not merely a new name for particular and universal, 305-9 B The perceptual object a true Aristotelian adjective of its situation, but not so the sense object, 310-14 C What is a universal? 314-15 D The universal as that which stands to a substantive or logical subject, in the grammatical relation of adjective to noun, 315-17 E Whitehead's 'object' not this sort of a universal, 317-20 F A universal of this sort would be, as it were, Whitehead's 'object' over-universalized, 320-1 G What we normally call universals are one kind of what he calls objects, 322-3 H Whitehead's 'sense object' not such a universal, nor his 'scientific object'. They are not predicable, as adjectives, of substantives, 323-5 I The perceptual object is so predicable of its event; but this undermines the traditional status of the sub- stance-quality category, 325-7 J Summary, 327-8 K That scientific objects are objects, not mere 'concepts which work', 328 L Can Whitehead abide by his dictum that 'nature is closed to mind'? 529-30 6 The nature of sensible appearances, Suppl. VI (1926), pp. 190-205 Synopsis: A Broad's 'epistemological object', what? A sensum plus a 'claim that'? 190-2 B How the introduction of the epistemological object seems to clarify his position, 192-4 C But are the difficulties met? 194-6 D His main criticism of Whitehead's theory of objects is only a criticism if his own theory is true, 196-9 E Broad seems almost to regret that we only perceive sensa, 200 F And not without reason. His having distin- guished sensa and physical objects in the way he has done, disqualifies his sensa from functioning as appearances; and he does not properly differentiate physical and visual space, 200-2 G Broad's charges proceed upon an assumption which Whitehead rejects, namely, that physical objects have 'simple location', 202-4 H The different senses in which Broad and Whitehead maintain the reality of secondary qualities, 204 7 Is the 'fallacy of simple location' a fallacy? Symposium, Suppl. VII (1927), pp. 207-23 Synopsis: A Anything occupying a definite region of space for a definite duration of time is, for Whitehead, simply located, 207-8 B It is abstractions that are thus located. So they are not 'subjective'. Nature is not bifurcated, 208-9 C Whitehead's denial that what 'is relatively to the observer' is subjective or unreal. Contrast Russell, Berkeley, 209-10 D Whitehead's reversal of the ordinary view of objects vis-a'-vis events, 210-12 E The substantive. Not object but event (which is in time) is the substantive with White- head, 212 F His 'ether of events', 213-14 G No re-bifurcation involved in White- head's distinction of object and event. Events are substantive; objects are not simply another sort of substantive, 214-15 H But Whitehead's use of the terms 'internal and external relations' lays his theory open to this misunderstanding, 215-17 I A precise sense in which we might understand Whitehead to have meant to make object and event external to each other. How we may possibly give a meaning to Whitehead's use of intemal and external relations, and reject his parallelism of himself with Leibnitz, 217-21 J The three propositions which, in Whitehead's philosophy, are asserted together, 221-3 8 Materialism in the light of modern scientific thought, Symposium, Suppl. VIII (1928), pp. 113-29 Synopsis: A Does Whitehead's earlier rejection of 'bifurcation' theories justify his later stressing of 'value' and 'purpose', or warrant any 'idealistic interpretation of modern science'? 113-15 B Rejection of 'bifurcation' theories. If the red patch is 'there, from here' and if it is there as I see it, this does not either make it mind or make it depen- dent on mind, 115-17 C The main objection to the older materialists is their claim to bring all our sensations within the scope of scientific laws, 118-19 D The conception of scientific law has changed, 119-22; E through the changed aspect which, with the 0180</page><page sequence="185">STEBBING Stebbing, L.

IX (1929), pp. 146-61 Synopsis: A Realism as the view that many simple propositions of common sense are true. The dispute is about what they say, not about whether what they say is true, 146-9 B Whether the scientific objects in terms of which it explains commonsense facts are 'real' or not, makes no difference to science, 149-51 C Confusions and fallacies which accrue if we contrast the commonsense picture with that of science as two opposing 'worlds' and ask of which we have 'knowledge', 151-6 D Questions about knowing and know- ledge which await an analysis which will make clear what it is that the questions are being asked about, 156-7 E The unconvincing solipsisms involved in the line of argument behind Russell's view of knowing and of knowledge, 157-9 F Confusions in the formu- lation of what seems to be Joad's main problem in this symposium, 159 G Are not Russell and Joad assuming that the solipsism entailed by their line of argument is known not to be true? 160-1 H The difficulties in realism as defined above, 161 10 Concerning Substance, Vol. XXX (1929-30), pp. 285-308 Synopsis: A Aristotle sees in a substance, as we do, a concrete thing, i.e. (i) a persistent entity, and (ii) a logical subject, 285-90 B The assumption (and the consequences of the assumption) that every proposition can be expressed in the subject-predicate form, 289-90 C Fact. The analysis of actual fact will, when carried far enough, always be found to involve only particulars and universals (characteristics), 290-1 D Mark, however, that universals include qualities and relations, 291-2 E 'Actual entities'. Whitehead blurs the distinction between universal and particular, by using 'actual entity' for particular (substance), 292-4 F Substance-quality. How Whitehead seeks to escape the difficulties of philosophies based on substance-quality, 294-6 G What it costs him, 296-9 H Process and Reality. How it nullifies the most important part of Whitehead's earlier philosophy of nature, 299-301 I Continuants. W. E. Johnson's notion of the continuant, 301-8 J Broad's observations, 302-5 K The ineluctibility of substance. Some concept of substance indispensable if we are to give a correct analysis of perceptual judgment, 306-7; L or make significant assertions about causation, 307-8 11 The method of analysis in metaphysics, Vol. XXXIII (1932-33), pp. 65-94 Synopsis: A Metaphysics a distinctive branch of philosophy. Its aim: to reveal the struc- ture of that to which reference is made in true statements, 65-6 B If metaphysics were 'the systematic study of the ultimate nature of reality' (McTaggart) its method would have to be deductive, 66-8 C If metaphysics had for its business to find reasons for our ordinary beliefs (Bradley) its method would have to be deductive, 68-70 D If the problem of metaphysics be one of analysis, then it is not a problem of finding reasons for our beliefs. It asks what we are believing in our commonsense beliefs, how they are inter-related, and how their inconsistencies are to be adjusted, 70 E In believing, e.g. that I am now seeing a pen, I cannot be mistaken that a black cylindrical sense datum is being directly presented, but the pen is not an inference from the datum. We begin with the pen-the perceptual object or situation, 71-2 F We begin our inquiry into material objects, not by asking for their definition but by asking what I am knowing in knowing one. This is doing metaphysics by analysis, not deduction, 72-4 G Our present theme: the presuppositions of this method as a method of metaphysical inquiry. (We are not interested in it as a method of constructing postulational systems), 74-6 H In metaphysics we analyse propositions, in grammar sentences. The former process is an effort to show what exactly some proposition asserts; i.e. what must be if it is asserted truly. Always it is a proposition we understand-we know its immediate reference, 76-9 I Metaphysical analysis seeks to find the configuration of the elements of the fact referred to in the true assertion, 79-80 J Facts having elements which are themselves complex (i.e. configurations of elements) are 'based' on facts which are simple in the sense of not having any such among their elements, 80 K Analysis of a proposition is more precise determination of what is asserted in it. Besides the non-basic fact asserted, we come to see the basic fact asserted. The analysandum is the former sort of fact and the analysis is 'directional', proceeding towards the latter sort of fact, 80-2 L Assumptions we make in pursuing metaphysic by this method, together with definition of some of the terms we use in setting them forth, 82-5 M In analysing a proposition we assume that it has been understood. We assume this even if we are not pursuing metaphysic but are only using the method to erect a postulational system, 86 N The further assumption made in pursuing metaphysics by analysis, i.e. beginning from nothing postulated but from an analysandum of given facts. It is assumed that the analysis has direction, i.e. that there are simple (absolutely specific) facts towards which it moves and which it can reach. Thus the 0181</page><page sequence="186">STEBBING Stebbing, L. S.-continued world (it is assumed) is constituted, 87-90 0 The reason why Principia Mathematica should be taken, not as the erection of a postulational system, but as an effort to use analysis upon a metaphysical problem, 90-1 P The issue is: are there absolute simple elements, or are simples simple only in the sense that they can be regarded so and an arbitrary system be thereby made possible. The former a plausible alternative, 91 Q It is also assumed that true propositions can be certainly found. Failure to see that there is indirect knowing as well as direct, and that it is not inference, is a fruitful source of unwarranted doubt here, 92-3 R Construction in metaphysics must wait upon analysis, 93-4 12 The apriori, Symposium, Suppl. XII (1933), pp. 178-97 Synopsis: A Confusions in Professor Hallett's statements about knowledge, 178-83 B What has Professor Hallett to say to those who do not see the need for explaining how aposteriori knowledge is possible? 183-5 C Is the truth or falsity of a proposition only determinable 'by its own intrinsic nature'? 185-6 D When we say that something must be so or so, are we saying something about the way in which we use words? Much truth in the view. Wittgenstein, C. I. Lewis, 186-91 E Are apriori propositions susceptible of variations in kind? Moore's affirmative to this, 191-3 F Are there literally alternative logics or alternative geometries? The affirmative answer doubtful, 193-7 13 Constructions, Vol. XXXIV (1933-34), pp. 1-30 Synopsis: A The chief questions the writer wishes to ask about constructions, 1-2 B Various senses. Need the view that a material thing is a construction, leave us with any 'problem of constructing' on our hands? 2-6 C Eddington's 'construction' of the physical world as really a construction of an abstract scheme, or deductive system, 6-9 D The world around us. We should not ask how it may be constructed or justly be in- ferred. It is not a construct, and not an inference. It is given, 9-11 E Dr. Stace's way of answering this (wrong) question. His use of 'construction', 11-16 F B. A. W. Russell's maxim, 'put logical constructions in place of inferred entities wherever possible'. He does not here seem to mean (as apparently would Dr. Stace) that logical constructions exist, as e.g. the objects of the world around us do, 16-19 G Is the maxim a way of saying our knowledge is confined to what we are acquainted with? Or does it only say some- thing about how physical objects are to be regarded? The former of these cues leads logical positivists to the doctrine that I can indicate to you only the structure of my experience and not its quality or content, 19-22 H Carnap's practice of substituting logical constructions for inferred entities wherever possible, leads him to speak as if both persistent substantival objects and the extemal world were constructs, 22-4 I Russell's confusing association of constructions with perspectives: Constructions (which are abstract) with perspectives (which are partial), 24-6 J We know the external world. The real question is that of analysis: What do we know in knowing it? We may know it as given, yet not directly. There can be an indirectly given, 26-9 K The place of 'construction' cannot be that which Whitehead and the great tradition in philosophy have given it, 29-30 14 Communication and verification, Symposium, Suppl. XIII (1934), pp. 159-73 Synopsis: A The problem: How is it possible for A to refer B, by means of a sentence, to a fact? (The 'sentence' is one, and the fact the other, of two sets of objects) 159-60 B If I communicate, there must be initial common understanding; and this concerning something not my direct experience (to communicate which would be nonsense). The answers offered to the question by thinkers who accept the verification principle. C. I. Lewis: common meaning shows in congruent behaviour. Ayer: minds can communicate, being of similar structure. Carnap: in virtue of protocol propositions (which communicate structure) a speaker can refer to that which takes the same place in his world and in the hearer's, 160-7 C Their difficulty in getting clear of the ego-centric predicament, 167-8 D The cue to the possibility of communication, as lying in my capacity for in- direct knowledge. I can understand, not only a statement saying what is occurring in my experience now, but one saying what has, or is going to occur. This is knowledge for whose significance only verifiability is essential, not literal verification in my present (private) experience, 168-71 E Lewis's failure to see that my knowledge of my past is indirect, leaves him still unable to explain communication, 171-3 F Summary, 173 15 Sounds, shapes and words, Suppl. XIV (1935), pp. 1-21 Synopsis: A What is a word? The two uses of the word 'word', 1-4 B Is the 'token' word an instance of the 'type'? 4-5 C The relation of tokens to one another which entitles them to be regarded as of the same type, 5-8 D Is the type merely the class of its tokens? Russell criticized, 8 E If this be 'the same word' as that, then this must be a type; and, properly speaking, its tokens neither instance nor signify nor copy it, 8-10 F Discussion of the view that tokens are of one type by having one meaning, 10-12 G Many tokens, obviously of different types, have yet the same meaning-words in various languages, 12-14 H The case of sentences and expressions.

Having, e.g. made a statement in writing I can point to it and say 'that is a proposition' but 'that' cannot be anything of what is sensibly present; and if it is a proposition it cannot be either our expres- sion or a type sentence or a class of token sentences, 18 ff 16 Some puzzles about analysis, Vol. XXXIX (1938-39), pp. 69-84 Synopsis: A The mistake of thinking analysis to be of propositions only that are true, is to be excused by the preoccupation with metaphysical problems, of those who first used the method. Witness B. A. W. Russell's search for something we indubitably know. It pre- supposes the validity of directional analysis, 69-73 B Criticism of directional (as opposed to same-level) analysis, if it purposes to 'reduce the number of objects in the world' (Duncan-Jones), 73-5 C Does especially new-level analysis yield 'what we really mean' when we use the analysandum? 75-8 D The usefulness of analysis in exposing misleading character in questions, whose own logical form predisposes us to expect an answer of the same form, 78-80 E Are differences of logical form, only in the way we use words? Difficulties in understanding J. T. Wisdom about this. Analysis not a 'defence of commonsense' which needs no defence, 80-4 17 The new physics and metaphysical materialism, Symposium, Vol. XLIII (1942-43), pp. 167-184 Synopsis: A A sense as of a promise of release from the old materialism (Huxleian determinism) is psychologically associated with the new physics, 167-72 B 'Ethical' materialism, 168-9 C Determinism and the prison-like universe, 169-72 D This refers rather to 'the reign of law' in the universe, than to any theory of the atom. The defeat of the case for exempting man came from biology rather than physics, 172-6 E Does the new physics set man free from the prison by revealing lawless happenings in nature? Quantum mechanics do not seem to show any lawlessness, 176-8 F Quan- tum phenomena. Waves and particles. Even if the former are waves of the known this does not make them mental-not even if what is known be a mathematical construct, 178-84 G To have found certain things to be knowledge-as, e.g. the waves of wave- mechanics perhaps are 'objective knowledge'-is not to have found them to be mental, 179 H Mind and mathematics. Their being a mathematical construct does not make waves mental, 179-80 I Nor would their being mental show reality to be-it would only show that reality at a certain level was-mental, 180-2 J And how can there be 'levels' or 'layers' of reality? 183-4 K The new physics neither makes the mental 'really' material nor the material 'really' mental; for neither statement makes sense, 184 STEDMAN, R.

Three partial characterizations, 75-80 D Two emergent principles, (i) the reality of the time factor in thought, (ii) the control of a sustained thought's temporal course by an intuition of its (the thought's) entirety, which (intuition) each successive statement modifies, 80-6 2 The validity of the belief in a personal God, Symposium, Suppl.

Symposium, Suppl.

When is the change in the thing and not in its appearance to us? 10-12 G Kant's answer to this question quite wrong, 12-13 H When is a change a change of this thing and not of that? 13-14 I What determines whether a thing has only changed or whether it has ceased to exist and something else taken its place? 14-16 J When something is said to have changed, what is the true subject to which the change is ascribed as a predicate? 16-17 14 Alleged self-contradictions in the concept of relation. A criticism of Mr. Bradley's 'Appearance and reality', Pt. 1, Chap. III, Vol. II (1901-02), pp. 1-13; 21-4 Synopsis: A The preamble, 1-2 B Bradley right that no reality can consist of terms- in-relation. But does he give the correct reason? 2-4 C To assume terms-in-relation as ever being anything self-subsistent, leads to incoherence, but is Bradley right that it is an intrinsically self-contradictory concept? 4-5 D Bradley's assertion that to say things are ever in relation is to say what is false, 5-6 E Is it true that, in virtue of the bare fact that they are qualities, qualities cannot be anything without relations? Yes. But this is not to say why, 6-8 F The alleged intrinsic self-contradiction of terms-in-relation. Is a vicious circle involved, as Bradley believes? 8-11 G Or a vicious endless regress? 11-13 H Continuum versus terms-in-relation: the distinction, 21-2 15 Mr. Bradley's theory of judgment, Vol. III (1902-03), pp. 1-28 Synopsis: A Bradley gets the idea used in judgment to be a 'sign' by dint of defining the term in a very peculiar way, 1-4 B The mode of existence of the 'sign' which an idea is. It exists as a psychic fact, 4-5 C The essential points of Bradley's theory, 5-8 D But when I judge that something 'is so or so qualified', need the qualification ever have been part of any existent 'psychic fact'?

Consequently, it does not doubt but that e.g. a colour (i) as it is in sensation and (ii) as it is in the object are correlated and the former representative of the latter, 146 E The standard condi- tions of perception. Those are standard which (i) have convenience, and (ii) favour distinct- ness in the perceived object, 147 F So far as regards their connexion with sense ex- perience, the primary qualities in no way differ from the secondary, 147-53 G There is an extension characteristic of sensation both visual and tactual, whose variations (under the same conditions of perception) are representative of objective differences of extension, 147-51 H Mistakes of Berkeley and of Kant in this context, 151-3 I The real distinction between the two classes of qualities is that matter has agency in virtue of its primary qualities, not its secondary.

This latter cannot be the individual mind's own cognitive unity. Hence there must be a universal subject of knowledge. Weakness of Kant's part in this argument, 347-55 B For Dr. Hicks the 'contents' of knowledge 'are not existents'. Criticism of the argument and reasons why a particular existent can, as such, be part of a content of knowledge, 355-8 C The difficulty that 'existence', in Kant's words, 'is never part of the content of any idea', discussed, 358-62 D The argument that contents of knowledge are always timeless, as existence cannot be, 362-6 E The argument that 'cognitions cannot cognize themselves' examined.

H. Bradley and B. A. W. Russell, 199-205 21 Can there be anything obscure or implicit in a mental state? Symposium, Vol. XIII (1912-13), pp. 281-99 Synopsis: A The alleged obvious absurdity, if anything is in consciousness at all, of its being 'implicit' there. The mistaken assumptions which account for this apparent difficulty, 281-5 B The evidence for there being undiscerned differences in sense experience, 285-98 C When we are aware of confusion, are we aware of none but the discerned, among its particulars? 286-8 D And have I not had a sensation if, having a perfect memory, I do not remember having had it consciously? 289-91 E Could the existence of sensations before they are noticed be an illusion of memory? 291-3 F May it be held that these undiscerned differences are not in the sensations but in0the things sensed? 293-6 G The Stumpf argument for undiscerned differences, from Weber's law, 296-8 H The evidences for undiscerned differences in thought experience, e.g. the unreflective identifying of a class or the unconscious making of an assumption, 298-9 22 The Status of sense data, Vol. XIV (1913-14), pp. 381-406 Synopsis: A Points on which there may be substantial agreement (with G. E. Moore) on the status of sense data, 381-2 B Divergencies, 382-4 C The knowledge of physical objects through sense data. In knowing any such datum do we know it as having a source? We do-as we know an image as having its source in a datum, 384-9 D The ultimate principle of such knowledge: sense data not self-contained, or complete, existences. They are known as fragmentary, i.e. as pointing beyond themselves, 389-91 E The primary sensibles, or sense data, through which we perceive a thing. The thing (i) is not the whole source to which they are referred and (ii) is not even the most immediate part of it, 391-6 F Moreover, it is to the whole source that we refer them (at the first, and to the end). The development of perception. How the original reference-to-an-object develops, yet persists throughout the development, 396-400 G That differences and relations of primary sensibles (sense data) are matched by differences and relations in their source, is certainly and immediately known, 400-1 H Reasons against the suggestion that any experienced sensibles (or sense-data) continue to exist when they are not being experienced, 401-6 23 Mr. Russell's theory of judgment, Vol. XV (1914-15), pp. 332-52 Synopsis: A Three genuine requisites of a satisfactory theory of truth are laid down by Russell. But are they all? 332-4 B There are at least three others, 334-7 C Belief and supposal. Without knowing I may believe (or again I may only suppose) that e.g. this actual box before me contains wool. In such belief or supposal, while the real contents cannot, of course, be before me as the object in belief or supposal, other relevant portions of reality may and must be. The belief is true when actuality not present as object of belief corresponds with what is so present, 337-9 D Russell's contrary view. How he secures that the facts on which a belief's truth depends, shall be something independent of the belief itself, 339-41 E The peculiar kind of 'correspondence with fact' in which, for him, the truth of a belief consists, 341-2 F Criticism. His theory possesses some of the requisites of a sound theory of judgment or belief, namely those which he himself (and rightly) recognizes; but it finds the truth of a belief in a 'correspondence' which is not between actual fact and anything present to thought in the act of believing, 342-4 G Moreover, what he has claimed to be before the mind as its object, in a true belief, turns out, upon examination, to differ from actual fact otherwise than in the only admissible way, 344-5 H The real mischief in Russell's theory is the underlying atomism, 345 I Criticism of his views of 'knowledge by acquaintance' and 'knowledge about', 345-52 24 Instinct and emotion, Symposium, Vol. XV (1914-15), pp. 91-9 Synopsis: A The real defects (versus McDougall's criticisms) of Shand's (substantially sound) conception of instinct, 91-6 B Does each major instinct involve one specific emotion?

Symposium, Suppl. III (1923), pp. 114-22 Synopsis: A Like concrete things, qualities or characters (and again relations) may differ merely numerically, i.e. otherwise than in kind. They are then particular, 114 B Character. X is a character of anything, if (and only if) X is predicable of it. Not its concrete possessions, only the having of them, is predicable of a thing; and this is a class of characters, not a single indivisible entity numerically the same in all the things it charac- terizes, 115-16 C Proper analysis of 'A is round, and B also is', 117-20 D Argument from, local separateness of round from round, when two locally separate things are both round, 120-1 E Argument from the circumstance that distinct things are distinguished by their qualities, 121-2 27 The nature of introspection, Symposium, Suppl. VII (1927), pp. 77-88 Synopsis: A Introspection is perception of (not inner perception of) mind. There is only inner (as distinguished from an external) perception of our bodies, 77-80 B But touching, tasting, etc. differ from one another as having different independent objects. In this (reflective) perception of the mind, the object is a subjective process, and so not independent, 80-5 C The (not really serious) difficulty of being interested at once in an object and in your interest in that object, 85-7 D Introspection only involves retro- spection-is not reducible to it, 87-8 28 Postscript to paper on 'The nature of introspection', Symposium, Suppl. VII (1927), pp. 244-9 Synopsis: A Is introspection 'awareness of the body from the inside'? No. For that would not be awareness of subjective process, 244-6 B Is the observation of our own mental images introspection? Yes. For though they are neither subjective processes nor ideas, they are mental, 246-9 29 Mechanical and teleological causation, Symposium, Suppl.

Is a cause a reason? 46 ff B We can and do have insight into necessary connexion within the field of natural process, 47-51 C Proof that there can be necessary connexion between matters of fact, 50 D Hume's denial that there can be a logical basis of induction, 50-1 E Active tendency in the cause is indispensable to the validity of causal inference, 51-3 F Does the bent bow have a 'tendency' to unbend? Yes, or there is no reason for its doing so, 51-2 G For Hume such tendency is indispensable to the rationality of causal process. He only cannot verify it in any relevant or satisfactory way, 52-3 H The source of our notion of such active tendency-a source which Hume searched for and missed.

What is so entitled is always a certain general kind of character, 1-4 B The view that an absolutely specific shade of red is literally a single character belonging indivisibly to a plurality of things, 4ff C The generic universal as a distributive unity, 5-8 D All characters are particular.

Symposium, Vol. IX (1908-09), pp. 201-16 Synopsis: A As against the assertion that there is only one real subject to which anything else is predicate, pluralism (whether rationalist or irrationalist) asserts the existence of a plurality of real individuals connected by 'intrinsic' relations, 201-3 B Support for some of the tenets of pluralism is to be derived from logic and the mathematical sciences as well as the direct knowledge we have of a plurality of substances, viz. selves, 203-6 C Inter-communication and social co-operation, however, imply a systematic unity of all individuals, and relations between them which are not merely intrinsic nor of the subject- predicate type, 207-10 D The community of substances is a teleological unity.

Its cardinal importance overlooked, as meeting the need, after the Renascence, for a new inwardness in art, 253-5 D Spengler accentuates its importance; throwing upon it the light of his peculiar principle in art, 255; E namely that the arts are not to be classified according to the senses to which they make appeal, on pain of classing together things profoundly different: Greek flute- playing with the European violin, for instance, 255-7 F Spengler's orientation, 257-8 G In what his results seem open to question. (i) In the arts are the senses only bridges unto the soul? (ii) Granting that they are, do they all equally so bridge? 258-9 H The way in which, on the other hand, Spengler has probably made an intelligible aesthetic for the first time possible; namely, by insisting that, e.g. the paintings of different periods can be altogether farther apart than, sometimes, the painting of a period and its music, 259 I The question why art in the west should have run to music. The probable condition on which we shall find this a real and fruitful question to raise, when asked in the light of Spengler's principles. We may have to modify his conception of the Western mind or soul. He places its accent on space. Did it not shift towards time? 260-3 J Symptoms of this appear if (construing the Western mind thus) we ask: what is German in the German differentiation of it, and French in the French differentiation? We find the two taking the rapids of the Renascence very differently, 263-8 K The difficulties in Spengler's segregation of the cultures, despite its substantial validity. A parallel to the difficulties of Leibniz with his monads, 265-8 L Have not the cultures sufficient of continuity to permit of our explaining the peculiarities of French art history by its genuine, inward con- tinuity with the classical? French art does not need to go to tone, 268-9 M Not that the predominantly plastic (and so light) character of art, here, is any the less modern (Faustian), 269-72 N Concluding reflection on French culture and on the cultural task ahead, 272-5 2 Artistic form and the unconscious, Symposium, Suppl. XIII (1934), pp. 119-37 Synopsis: A Gide says the Germans cannot draw and thereby implies the failure of their culture to achieve artistic form, 119 B Goethe's reflection over the problem of form tallies with Gide's in so far as the starting-point of both is the value of pure visual design. 0191</page><page sequence="196">UNDERHILL Thornburn, J. M.-continued Goethe thus distinguishes the truth of art from the mere truth of nature, 119-20 C His line of reflection, however, only begins where Gide's ends. For visual design is the correla- tive of a Nature which is outward merely. The form of which Goethe is in search is correla- tive to a Nature which is inward as well as outward, 120-1 D Form, in this latter sense, is what makes the completed work of art a work of the human spirit in a way in which much art (e.g. Greek art) is not, 121-2 E Difficulty of obtaining this ideal except through rhythm, 122-3 F Akin to music, rhythm has its danger, namely illusion (Wahn). Poetry and rhetoric have their music-kinship. Their appeal is prevailingly to the ear, not the eye, 123-5 G The abverb must be stressed. For Goethe finds a sensible element in all Wahnsinn just as he finds speech in music, or (more generally) value in the unconscious, 125-8 H Chamberlain's view of Goethe's art as one which transcends antithesis between Sinnenkunst and Wahnkunst. The unconscious or 'conscious-free' production (ascribed to the poet by Goethe) can be seen in Shakespeare, e.g. Hamlet, 128-30 J It appears there is a shape which discloses itself readily to anyone of, e.g. Ernest Jones' genius and training-the reason being that Shakespeare's medium is concrete, 130-1 K The 'conscious-free' which is at work in Goethe (whose medium is not real and concrete human personality, but something more mystical and nearer to music) is of another order, 131-3 L It cannot be understood as Jones has understood Shake- speare's; that is not to say the intellect has no access to the problem of its nature. Explana- uon by reference to the organism's own experience v. explanation by reference to the remoter free-conditioning of the organism, 133-6 M The musical not formless-only the utterance of a more remote or 'archetypal' unconscious, 136-7 UNDERHILL, E.* 1 Can the new idealism dispense with mysticism? Symposium, Suppl. III (1923), 148-60 Synopsis: A Mysticism. It deals, by intuitive apprehension, with the ultimate; it finds this neither in the successive, nor in the given (to sense or to the thoughts) but only in a trans- cendent otherness, 148-51 B The essence of mysticism and the calibre of its adherents, 151-2 C The mistaken accusations against mysticism (i) of 'getting behind the given', 152-4 D (ii) of 'abandoning thought' and (iii) of 'annihilating the subject' of experience. Its positive contention, that pure succession cannot give spiritual satisfaction or be the sub- stance of the real, 154-8 E The difficulty that the mystic's sense of certainty can be artificially produced, 158 F Touch with the Abiding Perfect. Its results, 158-60 URMSON, J. O.* 1 Are necessary truths true by convention? Supp. XXI (1947), 104-17 Synopsis: A If certain (e.g. logical) truths function as rules rather than as statements, does it follow that they are conventions in the sense that they might have been different? 104-8 B The 'convention' view of necessary truths as an explanation of the nature of logical necessity. Are all logical rules conventional, in the sense that we might have found ourselves using others? 108-11 C The second-order 'rule', namely that any language must have some rules, would seem not to be conventional in the required sense, 111-12 D It is not mere convention that rules must limit the 'area of reference' of (i) words and (ii) sentences, if there is to be language at all, which fulfils its purpose, 112-16 E Logical necessity as perhaps best understood in the light of the notion of purpose, 116-17 WADDINGTON, C. H.* 1 The relations between science and ethics, Symposium, Vol. XLII (1941-42), 65-7 Synopsis: A Ethical feelings: related to the super-ego and ego-idea, 65 B Ethical feelings: derived from experience of the external world, particularly from social events, 66 C Ethical feelings: their biological function is that they play a part in determining human social evolution, 66 D Such evolution may be observed to have carried forward certain general tendencies which can be found in the evolution of the animal kingdom, 66 E Science can contribute to the evaluation of ethical feelings by pointing out which systems of feeling are consonant with the general direction of evolution, 67 2 The relations between science and ethics, Symposium, Vol. XLII (1941-42), pp. 87-100 Synopsis: A Science makes no claim to be sole judge of ethical beliefs, 87 B The good. Attempts to give a verbal definition result in tautology and should be abandoned, 88 C The good. The function (i.e. the causal efficacy) of ideas of the good can be deter- mined, 89 D Things good-in-themselves. Attempts to specify them are clumsy ways of describing a direction by imputing to it a non-existent end, 90-4 E End and means. No ultimate distinction between them, 94 F Ethical beliefs.

XVII (1938), 54-68 Synopsis: A The difference between naming and describing, 54-8 B The consequent definition of a proposition as that which can be true or false, 58-9 C The utterance describing an immediate experience can be a falsely formed proposition, but not a false proposition, or a true one. Schlick calls it a Konstatierung, 59-60 D Doubt. It cannot exist without being expressed in a language. Yet it is more than the words in which it is expressed, 60-2 E In describing a doubt one must include an account of its expression, 62-3 F Russell gives the wrong reason why logical words must be used in describing doubt. The real reason is that description of a doubt must describe its expression, 63-5 G The supposed causal relation between an object word and its meaning. Russell criticized, 65-8 2 Verifiability, Symposium, Suppl. XIX (1945), 119-50 Synopsis: A Obviously, in empirical statements meaning and verification are connected, 119-20 B But the meaning of such a statement is not the verifying statements; for they are not entailed by it, 120-1 C Translation of a material-object statement into sense-data statements is impossible; but not because they are so many, rather, because of the 'open texture' of the concept to be translated, 121-4 D An empirical description is necessarily incomplete. Hence neither clear definition of an empirical term, nor exhaus- tive verification of a material-object statement is possible, 124-6 E The source of the open texture: viz. (not that too many things verify, but) that we never fully know what sort of thing would verify the empirical concept, 126-7 F So a single sense-experience never refutes beyond doubt any material-object statement. The evidences relevant to an empirical proposition (even a law of nature) only strengthen or weaken it; they do not prove it, or disprove, 127-31 G Relation between any empirical statement and the evidences is thus loose, and so the known relations of logic hold only between statements which belong to a homogeneous domain. Stratification of such domains, 131-4 H Mr. Mackinnon's views, 133-4 I Quantum mechanics disprove the Kantian view that nature must obey causal laws, 134-7 J Though not infallible, quantum theory shows-malgre Kant-that science without the causality principle is not impossible, 137-9 K Questions as to the nature or conditions of the reality of this or that (of existence, of knowledge, of fact, event, situation, etc.) cannot be raised while the use of these words is unsettled, 139-43 L Lan- guage and the world of facts, 143-8 M May not a quality be spoken of as something which a thing does, rather than has; or even as a certain manner of doing? 143-5 N And does not 'how spoken of' determine 'how experienced'? 145-6 0 Fact as such, our work. Language as the knife by which we cut out facts, 146-8 P Regulative principles that guide our construction of reality, 148-50 3 Are there alternative logics? Vol. XLVI (1945-46), pp. 77-104 Synopsis: A Different systems of logic already exist for special branches of science; it is possible that exotic languages might have their own logics; but are there different systems employed in our own language? 77-9 B It is said that the laws of (propositional) logic are tautologies and that they somehow reflect the nature of reality. This view presupposes that expressions containing 'not', 'and', 'if', etc., are to be interpreted as truth-functions. Such interpretation not unavoidable. This runs counter to the usual view of logic, 79-81 C In ordinary language an unfulfilled conditional may be interpreted as neither true nor false. This introduces a new idea of a proposition: we abandon the principle (which dominates classical logic) of getting a decision every time, 82-3 D In certain cases the most natural interpretation of ordinary language is not in terms of classical logic, e.g. (i) p--q may be understood as a partial negation of q, i.e. simply as denying q on the condition that p is false, and making no decision about what happens if p is true. Then p_q is a negation of q in the sense that it is true only where q is false (p being false in both cases); e.g. (ii) the conflict of p: q andpo-q cannot be exhibited in classical logic: but appears if we interpret the latter as a partial negation of the former; i.e. as denying pa q on the condition that p is true, 83-6 E Ordin language suggests various degrees of negation, e.g. 'not quitep' 'not at allp'. Negation may be directed to the system of which the proposition forms part, or against the proposition itself. Various ways of grading negations. No one logic is uniquely determinecd by our language; many different logics are suggested by it, 86-93 F In describing what we have seen or heard, a precise description taken by itself is commonly misleading: a more adequate description is provided by a set of different but related descriptions which are understood not to exclude each other. The law of excluded middle cannot usefully be applied, since there is no means of going back from recollection to the things remembered, 93-8 G A vague description consists of a set of different more determinate descriptions. Its logic is not classical; for (i) it is not a disjunction, since it may be true even where the constituents are indeterminate; (ii) it cannot always be interpreted as an expression with a variable, since the constituents may not fall under one determinable; (iii) the set may be known to be incomplete, 98-102 H We use N 0193</page><page sequence="198">WALKER Waisman, F.-continued vague terms to avoid the dilemma which arises when we cannot decide whether or not a precise term applies to a blurred impression: but then the difficulty is in deciding marginal cases.

H. 1 The character of a historical explanation, Suppl. XXI (1947), pp. 51-68 Synopsis: A In history we have to deal with a narrative of individual events in which those events are not merely described but, in some sense, explained, 53 B Collingwood's attempt to elucidate this by arguing that history is a special form of knowledge, giving us immediate understanding of individuals. It depends on his doctrine that all history is the history of thought, and his distinction of 'outside' and 'inside' in historical events, 53-5 C Defence of Collingwood's dictum against misconceptions, 55-7 D Its importance for historical explanation. It is because they can penetrate to the 'inside' of events that historians are able to use the semi-teleological procedure of 'colligation', 55-8 E This does not, however, make Collingwood' right in thinking that history gives us 'immediate' 'concrete' knowledge. Historical thinking involves implicit reference to generalizations; fundamentally they are generalizations about human nature, 58-60 F Defence of this statement against Marxian criticism, 61-2 G If historical explanation involves refer- ence to general propositions, how does it differ from scientific explanation? (i) In involving the process of 'colligation' already described; (ii) in certain peculiarities of the general propositions it involves, 63 H An attempt to characterize these peculiarities (i) The historian does not systematically study them: they spring from his experience. Compare the knowledge of human nature of the novelist or dramatist, 63-5 I (ii) They vary from age to age, though perhaps there is a fundamental set of them, 65-7 J Though pre- supposed in historical understanding, they are nevertheless themselves partly come by, by historical study, 67-8 K General conclusion, 68 WARD, J.* 1 The nature of mental activity, Symposium, Vol. VIII (1907-08), 226-34 Synopsis: A Mental activity is, as Alexander seems to say, the activity of attention, and is co-extensive with all consciousness.

Belief in a principle sympa- thetic to human values, behind the universe, 244 C The undeniable present existence of evil, 244-5 D Does it argue that the universe is the issue of some purely blind impetus? 245 E Of the two kinds of evil that there are, pain and sin, pain cannot be proved to be utterly evil. Though we naturally regard it so, this is because we dislike enduring it, which is not a sufficient reason for declaring pain intrinsically evil, 245-6 F And it becomes a problem only if we are trying to believe in a good God. It is a fact, not a problem, when there is no such belief. Yet to say that pain prevents our believing in a good God overlooks the fact that man was fully acquainted with pain long before he though of God as good, 246 G The perseverance through pain, of such belief, facili- tates adjustment to life-a matter of philosophical significance, 246-7 H But why should the other kind of evil exist, namely moral evil? An answer which takes us some of the way is that unless evil existed, the power of good to redeem it would not be disclosed, 247-8 I But why do we account sin evil? The theistic significance of this question. The answer 'because we are so made' suggests our origin in a source of being which is moral, 248-50 J There is no problem but on the (theistic) assumption that goodness is what should be, 250-1 2 The status of religious knowledge, Vol. XLIV (1943-44), pp. 75-90 Synopsis: A A postulate of all religion-the divine can be so approached as to become favourably related to man. This postulate underlies the approach of the savage equally with that of modem man to God, 75-6 B The philosophical question 'is man's know- ledge of God knowledge?' The antithesis 'faith' v. 'knowledge' is misleading. All know- ledge is based on faith, 76-7 C Or is it only an immediate, mystical experience? 77-9 D Weakness of this position. Dream-experience, which introduces us to an immediate unreasoned awareness, seems the nearest parallel to man's earliest form of knowledge, 79-80 E Religious knowledge as that very blend of intuition and inference which other knowledge is, 80-1 F And though it cannot be made logically coercive, 81; G it is not any more 'hypothetical' than is all our knowledge, 81-4; H any qualification of this, in its case, being only due to its special subject-matter, not to its character as knowledge, 84-5 I Religion emerges as the expression of a certain valuation of life, 85-6 J What the religious hypothesis explains.

How does this comport with its aim at universal validity? 106-9 B The personal idealists (also others) so habituallymake light of this question, that an analysis of 'personality' becomes urgent, 109-11 C Is per- sonality literally what one cannot share with any other? The unsatisfactoriness of either the 'yes' or the 'no' answer, here 111-13 D It is impossible to give up the reality of the universal if there is to be knowledge or meaning at all. But science, morals and meta- physics alike require (as that, the consciousness of which is personality, also requires,) that the real universal should not be a merely formal identity, 113-16 7 Obligation, autonomy and the common good, Vol. XX (1919-20), pp. 113-24 Synopsis: A The general will is not another will (of the community) over and above that of the community-members, 113-14 B For Kant-and rightly--the sense of obligation is the central feature of the moral consciousness, 114-15 C For Green, this sense is our acknowledgement of a common good as our own, 115-16 D But the sense of obliga- tion cannot be this. This is not what is authoritative, 116-17 E Kant's selection of 'the autonomy of the will', as a description of what is obligatory upon us, 117-18 F The influence of the Kantian idea of autonomy (combined with that of Rousseau, Aristotle, perhaps even Plato) in determining Green to find the source of man's sense of obligation in the identification of his will and the general will for a common good, 118-21 G The contemporary tendency to play down authority in ethics is probably connected with this view of the source of moral obligation, 121-2 H This, however, not genuinely Kantian.

Dream events not only take place no-where but (owing to relativity) also no- when. Nature, to our senses, is-colours, shades, sounds, smells projected from a sensorium into a space-time continuum, 4-8 D Thus our discrimination of reality from dream requires this 'ingression' of sense-objects to be their ingression amongst the events of a dominant space-time continuum. This is, again, that 'patience' of fact for the factors of fact which, it was argued elsewhere, must exhibit itself as a systematized uniformity within fact, 8-9 E Note (i) that there is nothing in Hume's principles to explain our power to distinguish reality from dream; and (ii) if the ingredient sense-objects be dismissed as 'mental' or 'subjective', so must everything else be also dismissed, 9-11 F Conscious- ness must be taken as one factor within fact and, like others such, significant of factors beyond itself, 11-12 G But this being significant of factors beyond itself is character- istic of all factors of fact.

The physical symptoms indicate it, perhaps; but if they do, it is not in the same way as the bubbling sound indicates water boiling, 123-4 C Is it by analogy that I know? For I sometimes myself manifest those symptoms. Knowing the feeling I have then, I now attribute to the other man an analogous feeling, 124 D But that cannot be knowledge. Nothing can be an analogy which cannot conceivably be confirmed as such, 124-5 E We often know the weight of a thing too light to feel. Is it, perhaps, in that way we know another's anger? 125-6 F We might deny having even that kind of a knowledge of other minds, but only mean thereby that we do not in fact have such knowledge; which is not scepticism. The sceptic says that we cannot have it. This, however, was only to utter a necessary truth. Is our knowledge of the inner life of another perhaps like our knowing the weight of something too light to feel? For that would be impossible only as being a contradiction, 124-7 G A reply to this suggestion: 'To observe what is by definition unobservable would doubt- less be contradictory. But the other's thoughts, images, etc. are observable-by him' 127-8 H Granting that this makes some difference, we must still ask: does it let us know another's mental states from his symptoms by analogy with what we know our own to be when we are showing similar symptoms, 128-30 I Why this metaphor is adopted. It is inter alia, because a prediction of, say, pain affects so differently (i) the person who is to have it, and (ii) the rest of us; meaning, to us (when it comes) sensations as of the outward symptoms of pain, whereas to him it means that, and pain too. The pain is something he alone can know, 130-2 J Yet, that a prediction about something which is to come into his mind cannot be verified by us, as he verifies it, is, if not a mere common- place fact, a tautologous statement, 132-41; K and to deny that we can check-up on 'expected pain' as the person expecting it does, is only to deny an absurdity; this, equally, 0Q00</page><page sequence="205">WISDOM Wisdom, J. T.-continued whether 'pain' be taken as symptoms only, as symptoms plus a certain sensation, or thirdly as sensation only, 134-6 L What the other alone is said to be able to know, (some- thing about his mind) is only inscrutable to the onlookers because it is defined as something not visible to them. How, having seen that 'I cannot verify his feelings as he does' is a tautology, we can also see the point of it, and what keeps people uttering it, 136-41 M-O We cannot verify 'he will have pain' in the way he does when it comes upon him. A last objection: may this not all be explained by the simple circumstance that he and we are, in effect, verifying different statements? This, as the wrong way out of the puzzle about how we know (what we surely do sometimes know) the experiences of a mind other than our own, 141-61 1 This synopsis, unlike the others of the Author's papers, was made editorially. After reading the first draft of it he supplied the following three alternative versions, which are printed here with his permission. Summarizing the argument of this his fifth paper, the Author says: I How do we know a man's angry? Not like we know a kettle's boiling-by deduction from the physical symptoms. Not like we know from the clatter of cups that they are having tea next door- that is, by analogy. More like the way we know the weight of what's too light to feel. The words 'we don't really know the weight of what is too light for us to feel the weight of it' state either the matter of fact that we don't feel differences in weight between feathers, grains of sand, and the like, or the necessary truth that we can't know the weight of things the weight of which we cannot feel, in all the ways we can know the weight of things the weight of which we can feel. Likewise, the sceptic's statement, 'We cannot really know the feelings of another' states either the matter of fact that telepathy is rare, or the necessary truth that one man cannot know the feelings of another in all the ways the latter can. That this is a necessary truth requires that there are things which one man knows in a certain way while it is self-contradictory for others to know them in that way. This last seems impossible and the seeming impossibility makes it especially difficult to see in this case that what the sceptic says is a necessary truth. But when we recall that the things one man can know which another can't are things about his own mind, and that these are defined as things he can know in a way others can't, the mystery vanishes. 'Snakes' is a statement, not about 'public' snakes but about John Smith's 'private' snakes, only while not any Tom, Dick or Harry can tell its truth by looking for snakes. So when the sceptic says 'We cannot know what is in the mind of another in the way that other does' what he says is necessarily true. And therefore, he is like one who laments that we cannot know the future like we know the present, cannot draw lines truly parallel that yet may meet. II More briefly: How do we know a man's angry? Not like we know a kettle's boiling-by deduction from the physical symptoms. For in knowing another man's angry we use the analogy of our own feelings. But this is not to use analogy like we do when we know they're having a party opposite: for then we may ourselves be wrong: that is, to such knowledge is opposed a non-analogical, direct knowledge. Do we know a man's angry like we know the weight of thistle-down? Here the weight isn't known merely from the symptoms on the scales; but from this in conjunction with having felt the weight of things we have weighed. We can, of course, imagine ourselves feeling the weight of thistle- down, or, if you like, we can't because it would then no more be light as air and so no longer thistle- down. If one speaks the first way, then 'we can't really feel the weight of thistle-down' is an eternal truth-because it's a tautology in that natural development of language to which we are encouraged in its proof. 'We can't know the anger, the feelings, of another' is also either a familiar fact or a pathological tautology. Someone will protest that a man's anger, the contents of another's mind, are not quite like unobservable things, which cannot be known differently from the way we know them only because there's no sense in such different and more direct knowledge. For they are not things nobody can know differently from the way we know them. For somebody does know them differently. The man in whose mind they are does. And if it is not absurd for one man to do this then surely it is not absurd for another! But it is. For it is from feeling angry that a man knows that someone who said he'd be angry is right. And we can't in that way know that that prediction is right-we can't. For our feeling angry would have nothing to do with the case. Or rather, it might be a clue (we might have telepathic powers) but it wouldn't show us the rightness of that prediction like the feeling of the man the prediction was about shows him its rightness, or like it would show us the rightness of a like predic- tion about ourselves. III In sum: We may desire a knowledge of others which we have not-for example, we may desire the gift of telepathy. We may desire an understanding of others which we have not, a one-ness with others which we have not or seldom have. But the sceptical philosophers have spoken as if we had some ignorance more ineradicable than this, as if we must always lack something that might have been. Looking more closely we notice that, when the 'must' is more than a matter of fact, then it is so because the 'might have been' has vanished into nothing. 'Lines so truly parallel can never meet'. This absurd lament for nothing is not without significance-it is not only that when disentangled from statements as to what we in fact can't do it illuminates hidden and confusing though familiar features of the language through which we see the world; it also suggests, evinces, a 'contradiction' in our desie, which d,oes, ided too often or always prevent the best, but not inevitably. 0201</page><page sequence="206">WITTGENSTEIN Wisdom, J.

When, e.g. someone is investigating a philosophical problem,-say that of the meaning of the copula-then the object, the topic, is one full of mind and thought, of course. Yet it is (i) something stubbornly objective, and (ii) something not possibly causally affecting the investigating mind; not even causing feeling in it, in any sense which would require it to be active and changing in the process, 110-13 E What does cause the change in feeling? Not the object but the mind's being aware of it, 114-16 F If the act of atten- tion is not caused by the mental object, could any manner of 'mind' initiate that act if it (the mind) were reducible without remainder to its own states? 116-21 G We must fall back eventually on an active 'I'. And it has no monopoly of mystery if it be 'mysterious', 121 H Witness Stout's 'object view' of the unity of the self, 122-3; I and his (later) view that it is the body which is active, 123-4 J Criticism of Stout. And of Price, 124-5 K The place of the testimony of the common man, 125-6 WRINCH, D. M. 1 On the summation of pleasures, Vol. XVIII (1917-18), pp. 589-94 Synopsis: A The pleasures ofp and q separately do not, added, necessarily give the pleasure of p and q together, 589-90 B But the 'influence' of one experience q on the pleasure of another, p (taken as meaning 'the pleasure of p given q less the pleasure of q) can be so brought into the reckoning as to yield a functional relation between the pleasure of ex- periences together and the pleasure of experiences separately, 590-4 2 On the structure of scientific inquiry, Vol. XXI (1920-21), pp. 181-210 Synopsis: A Certain aspects of the structure of scientific inquiry are here discussed with special reference to those problems which occur in the more advanced sciences, 181 B The data of science elicited by experiment and observation are discrete and particular. Only when such data are subsumed under general propositions is the field of science proper entered, 181 ff C A central topic is thus the nature of the relation between particular propositions yielded by experience, and the general propositions with which science opens, 182 ff D The passage is from a set of propositions, 'a, b have the properties P and I' to the generalization 'Everything which has the property (D has the property !', 182ff E The passage is evidently not guaranteed by logic. A new element is needed. This is the idea of probability and a set of principles governing its use, 183ff F The next issue is as to the nature of the relation between the various general propositions within one science, 186ff G A first point is to avoid logical redundancy, 187ff H The analysis of physical ideas. These are analysed as bundles of propositions. If a set of properties 0203</page><page sequence="208">WRINCH Wrinch, D. M.-continued representing a certain idea is sufficiently abstract or formal, logic itself will have suggestions to offer as to other accompanying properties, 185ff, 190ff I Evidently it is the study of formal and abstract properties which will tend to bring about the greatest advances in science, 192ff, 203ff, 207ff J The process of analogy in various branches of science, 205 ff 3 The idealistic interpretation of Einstein's theory, Symposium, Vol. XXII (1921-22), pp. 134-8 Synopsis: A The theory of relativity is a part of physics which is idealistic or realistic only in the sense in which this statement would be true of other branches of physics, 134 B As such, it rests on a number of assumptions, which include the legitimacy of analysis and the status of concepts as constructions defined by general propositions of the form 'if a has the property f, it also has the property g' and the reality of sensations. It is unjusti- fiable to conclude concerning the theory of relativity that it permits any deductions as to the nature of mind or that it can be given an 'idealistic' interpretation, 134-8 4 On certain aspects of scientific thought, Vol. XXIV (1923-24), pp. 37-54 Synopsis: A Attention is drawn to certain important principles of procedure characteristic of scientific thought in its conceptional stage, 37 B Many important scientific hypo- theses may be grouped together as irrelevance postulates, 37-9 C Among these, some are properly designated as postulates of invariance. Examples from the theory of relativity. Gaussian co-ordinates discussed, 39-44 D The laws of combination introduced. Probability theory as an example of such laws, 44-9 E True analogy, as the process by which information about one set of phenomena is obtained from information about another set of phenomena, through an identity of formal characters. Examples: The view that the present highly developed state of physics is in part owing to the successful choices of concepts in its various branches which satisfy structurally similar laws, 49-54 5 The quantum theory, Symposium, Suppl. IV (1924), pp. 27-33 Synopsis: A Of all the distinct states of a physical system that are mathematically possible, the quantum theory assumes that only some are physically possible, 27-8 B The nature of the justification of which such an assumption is susceptible, 29-30 C The need for a restatement of the theory from the point of view of scientific methodology, 30-2 D Summary 32-3 6 The concept of energy, Symposium, Suppl. V (1925), pp. 55-63 Synopsis: A The principle of the conservation of energy formulated according to Born, 55-6 B The impact on it of the theory of relativity discussed, 56-60 C The trend in science to-day is towards more austere postulates, 60-2 D The fact must be em- phasized that science-or philosophy-depends on the final analysis, which must be accepted or rejected, without logical reasons, 62-3 7 Scientific methodology, with special reference to electron theory, Vol. XXVII (1926-27), pp. 41-60 Synopsis: A During recent years electron theory has become a focus of interest for scientific methodology, 41-6 B The recent progress in spectroscopy discussed, includ- ing the Balmer and Rydberg formulae, 44ff C The logical status of the quantum of action reviewed, 48 ff 8 Is the 'fallacy of simple location' a fallacy? Symposium, Suppl. VII (1927), pp. 237-43 Synopsis: A No way of constructing a space-time can well be such as could give 'simple location' to events, 237-8 B Is the relation of an event to space-time only intelligible when taken as involving a relation to other events? 238-9 C The importance of settling relative to what space-time (space-time how constructed) the question is being asked, 239-40 D How Whitehead comes to speak of a 'fallacy of mis-placed concreteness', 240-1 E Where this fallacy does not matter and where it does, 241-2 F Similar problem arises about simple location of objects, namely, in what space-time? 242-3 9 Aspects.of scientific method-with special reference to Schrodinger's wave mechanics, Vol. XXIX (1928-29), pp. 95-122 Synopsis: A Scientific method is the application of logic to the material of science, 97ff B The conceptual stage in physics discussed, 98 ff C The view that concepts represent sets of properties explained, 99 ff D The interpretation of scientific theories can be seen to be a delicate matter. This illustrated in terms of Bohr's theories and Schrodinger's wave mechanics, 101ff 10 Scientific method in some embryonic sciences, Vol. XXX (1929-30), pp. 229-42 Synopsis: A Scientific theory as 'the geometry of facts', 229-42 B The newer sciences as an intriguing field for the student of scientific method, 229-30 C The arranging of facts in groups-the beginning of a young science's growth-is a problem of the same struc- ture as a geometry, 230-1 D Gesell, in collecting material for a science of mental 0204</page><page sequence="209">ZANSTRA Wrinch, D. M.-continued growth, shows his task to be 'exactly a problem in geometry', 232 ff E Mrs. Sidney Webb's account of her collection and arrangement of facts, and again Darwin's procedure, also show the pattern, 236 F How the methodological principle, that arrangement in a scale leads to quantitative evaluation, may be seen at work, 237ff; G 'ordinal similarity' -the extent of the use of graphs and diagrams in some of the newer sciences, 241-2 YOUNGHUSBAND, F. (SIR FRANCIS EDWARD YOUNGHUSBAND)* 1 Religious experience and philosophy, Vol. XXVIII (1927-28), pp. 117-34 Synopsis: A Religion as experience of what is going on at the heart of things, 117 B The religious experience: it is possible to lead those who do not have it to some understanding of it, 117 C As friendship might explain (i) love of individual for individual, so love of country might explain (ii) love of God, to those who are strangers to both, 118 D Love of country is love of us by our country, no less than love of our country by us, 118-19 E This is abundantly plain to the plain man, 119 F Evidences of the love of our country for us, 119-21 G The one thing more real and valuable than love of country is a man's experience of (i) his love for the world, and (ii) the world's for him, 121-2 H Like the experience of patriotism, religious experience is ordinarily dormant but does (though more infrequently than patriotism) flare up, 122 I Its habit of not coming when stren- uously sought, 122 J What it is when it does appear, 122 ff K The challenge to philosophy which this experience is, 124ff L If love is insight, this love of the world should be philosophic insight, 125 ff M As a native of it, a man epitomizes his own country; similarly, as a native of the universe he epitomizes it, 128-9 N Man and the physical cosmos, 127-31 0 Some human beings more representative of the cosmos than others are, 131-3 P Religious experience as clue to the nature of things, 133-4 ZANSTRA, H. I The construction of reality, Vol. XLV (1944-45), pp. 167-84 Synopsis: A Direct experiences and strict logic. The problem: how is knowledge beyond one's own present consciousness obtained? 167-8 B Indirect experiences of the past, by memory, the most certain. Memory a type of clairvoyance, 168-70 C The existence of other persons concluded by analogy or induction. The principle of induction formulated, 170-3 D The outer world. Measurement of bodies in space and of time-intervals, 173-6 E The principle of induction as means of gaining knowledge of indirect ex- periences, 176-8 F The two fundamental beliefs: (i) belief in the reliability of memory, (ii) the principle of induction.
