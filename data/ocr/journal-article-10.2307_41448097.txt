CARPENTER Department of Psychology The Pennsylvania State University INTRODUCTION THE about purpose grouping of this behavior paper is of to non-human formulate primates. tentative generalizations The need is about grouping behavior of non-human primates. The need is great for attempts to construct a conceptual system to give direction, form and significance both to collected data and to on-going research. This paper is a condensed revision of a contribution to an inter- national symposium held in Paris in 1950. The symposium was reported in a monograph entitled The Structure and Physiology of Animal Societies. It may be premature to attempt to formulate generalizations and sketch the parameters of grouping behavior of primates. Available information is sketchy. The requirements of adequate sampling ha vo not been applied to the selection and study of different types of orders, families, genera and species. Field investigations and experimentations have been integrated only to a very limited extent. Qualitative studies have not been balanced with quantitative studies on social interactions. The generalizations which will be stated should be considered as hypotheses needing further proof or disproof. It is never premature in science to formulate hypotheses provided they are understood as such and not accepted as established principles. * This paper is a summary of a more extensive study.

Although these assumptions are taken for granted by those of us who do research in the field, some are rejected, either explicitly or implicitly, by many of our colleagues. These assump- tions are the following: A. That the general principles of scientific methodology are emi- nently appropriate for investigating behavioral interactions of organisms, including grouping behavior, social stimuli and re- sponses, social organization, and even complex cultural processes. B. That a central task of comparative research on social behavior is to describe and measure, if possible, the central tendencies or commonalities of such behavior as well as its variabilities or differences. C. That all levels of complexity of interactional social behavior operate within a tissue of ordered, interactional forces and deter- ministic energy systems. D. That in the phylogenetic scale organisms and their behavior tend to become more complex from the so-called " lower " to " higher " forms, and that increasing complexity may result in differentiated " emergente." E. That the analytic approach dealing with problems in an order varying from the simple to the complex is a justifiable scientific approach. F. That a principal justification for investigating and striving to understand the social adaptations and adjustments of non-human primates is to add to the information and advance our under- standing of the social adaptations and adjustments of man. The following are assumptions which for us are untenable. Never- theless, they are accepted, either implicitly or explicitly, by many of our colleagues, and in the interest of intellectual integrity we must argue their validity. A. That the primate Homo sapiens differs so greatly from all other genera of the order Primates, especially on the level of complex social behavior, that investigations and data of non-human pri- mates have no significant relevance to understanding the deter-</page><page sequence="3">GROUPING BEHAVIOR OF NON-HUMAN PRIMATES 271 minants of human behavior or, conversely, that the similarities of the two are so great that identity can be assumed. B. That the phenomena known as " mind," language, society, culture and " values " exist exclusively on the level of human evolution. C. That explanatory systems can consist of dichotomous, over-sim- plified concepts such as heredity-environment, physical-mental, emotional-rational, implicit-overt, natural-supernatural, indi- vidual-social and animal-human. D. That the predominantly important determinants of social adjust- ment operate in external situations or, conversely, that genetic determinants in the organism are of predominate importance in determining social behavior. These and similar untenable assumptions have led to prevalent homo- centric delusions which pictures man abstracted out of his biotic context, as dissociated from his supportative base of natural resources and as living and merely acting in response to the currents of " social " forces. Furthermore, the conflict of basic assumptions which we have outlined above has led to disassociations of the biological and social sciences and to the "foreign" languages of different academic disciplines. One example is the fantastic verbiage which has been developed by psycho- analyists and psychiatrists to describe sex behavior, aggression, and reaction to social controls of the individual. Let us now attempt to formulate tentative generalizations for some of the major features of grouping behavior. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION A basic approach to the study of grouping behavior in non-human primates is that of describing the objective, observable and perhaps measurable spatial distributions of populations and organized groups. Non-human primates are restricted in their geographic distribution and adaptations to climates and biotic environments of tropical and sub- tropical regions. Why? Apparently because they do not migrate, hibernate, store food nor build shelters which effectively protect them from weather. Thus, we may generalize (1) that non-human primates lach adaptive and adjustive capabilities for coping with those degrees of climatic variations and fluctuations in food supply other than those variations typical of tropical and semi-tropical regions.</page><page sequence="4">272 G . R. CARPENTER Within geographic ranges and in population segments, organized groups of types which have been studied show strong tendencies to adjust to limited territories. These territories are occupied, possessed and defended against other organized groups of the same species. However, groups of other species or genera are tolerated within territories. The evidence seems to be adequate to support the generalization (2) that organized groups of non-human primates adjust to limited territorial ranges and defend these territories against other organized groups of the same species . Within territories, organized groups arrange themselves in patterns of group scatter. Different genera exhibit different but characteristic group- ing patterns. The average spatial arrangements of individuals to each other in a group, ignoring variations introduced by disturbed actions, would seem to express, or be indicators, of strengths of attachment, inter- dependence or probabilities of interactions among members. From this we may derive a third generalization (3) that individuals in free-ranging organized groups deploy themselves in space in an inverse relation to the strength of positive interactional motivation and conditioning and in direct relation to the degree of negative motivation and conditioning . This generalization could be transformed into an expression of inter- action probabilities. Exceptions occur for fighting in which antagonism of some degrees results in close-in hostile behavior. COMPOSITION OF GROUPS Sufficient information is available to permit formulating several im- portant generalizations about the composition of non-human primate groups. The first of this series is: (4) that the sizes of groups in undisturbed populations varies within definable limits and around central grouping tendency characteristic of a genus . This generalization indi- cates that the sizes of groups fluctuate within each species or genera and that there are size differences for different genera. The comparative research problem becomes that of determining what factors influence the number of animals in groups and what factors operate in various species or genera to produce inter-genera variabilities. Age of the organized group, reproductive rate, group division and population density are known to affect group sizes. The number of animals and their characteristics importantly affect the behavior of individuals and the group as a whole.</page><page sequence="5">GROUPING BEHAVIOR OF NON-HUMAN PRIMATES 273 CENTRAL GROUPING TENDENCIES Records of central grouping tendencies for different types provide additional descriptive information which can be compared for different types. The following are expressions of median groupings for three representative types: Howlers 3 adult males + 7 adult females -f- 2 infants + 4 juveniles -f- unknown number of males living alone Spider Monkeys 2 adult males + 4 adult females -f- 2 infants -f- 4 juveniles -f- extra group males living in groups Gibbons 1 adult male + 1 adult female -f- 1 infant -f- 3 juveniles both males and females living alone temporarily. Confidence is high in the reliability of the expressions for howlers and gibbons but low for spider monkeys. Recently, recalculations on population data of howlers of Barro Colorado Island for 1935 and that published by Collias and Southwick ('52) show that percentages of dif- ferent categories to total population in groups remain relatively stable even after marked reduction in the total population and the consequent reduction in the size of groups. These data lead to the fifth generaliza- tion : ( 5 ) that proportions of different classes of animals in groups with respect to age and sex is more stable than the total size of groups. SOCIONOMIC SEX RATIO In the non-human primate groups which have been studied, extra- group individuals have been observed. In most genera, these extra-group animals are males, but in gibbon populations both " solitary " males and females are observed. These animals apparently reflect differences in the ratios of adult males and adult females living within groups since in most there are fewer males than females. Thus, we come to a generalization on this intra-group socionomic ratio which seems to be a function of basic social adjustments. The relevant generalization is: (6) that the composition and stability of primate groups is strongly affected by the relative balance of male with female sexual hungers and capacities and reciprocal satisfaction among adult members of groups .</page><page sequence="6">274 С. В . CARPENTER STATUSES OF INDIVIDUALS IN GROUPS Status is an ordinal concept applicable to individuals arranged on the basis of behavioral data along a gradient scale or continuum. Individuals have status only relative to other individuals. The definition of social gradients of behavior and interactions within groups is one approach to describing the structure of groups. There are probably many such definable gradients, e. g., rights of access or possession, prestige or behavioral effects, spatial positioning " privilege " and dominance-sub- ordinance. Of these the latter has been investigated most and is best known. The relevant generalization is: (7) that in non-human primate groups there exist ordinal series of positions or definable continua or gradients which represent for individual animals, relative to others , the probabilities of occurrence of definable hinds of overt behavior. And, for our purpose, the variously defined behavior of " dominance " may be sketched by the generalization (8) that the probability of access to incentives appropriate to activated drives of interacting animals defines the dominance statuses of individuals . Several subordinate facts are noteworthy : Dominance for a given individual, in a given group context, tends to be relatively constant; nevertheless variations occur in the drive strengths of interacting individuals. Also, a kind of social summation of statuses may occur when individuals are closely associated. Also, an individual may derive status from association with another or other individuals. In extreme cases, finally, and with few individuals, supreme, exclusive and generalized statuses may be attained. All statuses in primate groups must be continuously maintained. Status may be lost gradually or suddenly. GROUP CONTROL Organized groups have behavioral systems for regulating and con- trolling their actions. In the past these have been inadequately described by emphasizing for most types the anthropomorphic concept of " leaders." Therefore, another generalization is in order: (9) that the control of a group is distributed among individuals and classes of individuals in direct proportion to the statuses of individuals or classes of individuals . Control potentials are learned by group members and control is often exercised through signal or cue behavior associated with specific indi- viduals and their actions.</page><page sequence="7">GROUPING BEHAVIOR OF NON-HUMAN PRIMATES 275 INTEGRATION Groups of non-human primates exhibit observable behavior which indicates varying degrees of group integration. Some of these indicators are the number and kinds of individuals which join or leave the groups, the variations in group scatter or spatial patterning, the amounts of intra-group conflict, degrees of concerted action, etc. Conceivably, the integration of groups is affected by both centripetal and centrifugal types of behavioral interactions. What then determines the direction and degrees of these " social movements " ? This brings us to the tenth generalization: (10) that the vector sums of the centripetal and centri- fugal forces equal the degree of group cohesion or integration , and in turn, the drives , tensions or needs of individuals interacting with incen- tive behavior of other individuals both modify and stabilize the total network of interactions in the group . Simply stated, many of the drives of each individual are satisfied, or reduced by interactions with other individuals. The interactions are reciprocal and this reciprocity of inter- action principle is considered to be very fundamental in the dynamics of groupings. The principle refers to organism-behavior characteristics which can never be neglected in the study of social behavior however difficult the task of specifying and measuring the dimensions of these interactions. At this point let us revert from considerations of groups as wholes to the basic elemental unit. In the study of complex groups it will often be necessary to limit observations or measurements and to provide for controls. This brings us to a methodological generalization: (11) that the basic interactional unit is the reciprocal stimulus response interactions of one individual with another symbolized by 0 1 О2. A definition of this generalized unit of study involves describing O1 and O2, defining the quality of behavior, describing or measuring inter- actional factors and effects and describing the context in which the animals act. It is believed that this unit can be systematically extended to cover the total number of paired interactional possibilities of a group U(N 1) which equals - - - Experimentation under controlled conditions using the 0 1 ±=? O2 unit has been fruitful and remains promising.</page><page sequence="8">276 С. R. CARPENTER AUTONOMY OF GROUPS Organized groups of non-human primates tend to be autonomous; they are capable of maintaining, regulating and controlling themselves largely independently of aid or assistance from other groups. However, they are only semi-closed, since there are exchanges of members from group to group, under some conditions, thus providing for " out-breeding." The relevant generalization is: (12) that organized groups of non-human primates tend strongly to be autonomous, self -maintaining and regu- lating . Such groups express resistance and hostility to other organized groups. of the same but not different species (genera). These propositions set the stage for a final generalization: (13) that organized groups of a population of the same species in a limited region do not have supergroup social mechanisms . Groups are not included in tribes, clans, communities, etc. as are found on the human level. Kin- ship relations are not operative and inbreeding is the rule rather than the exception to the normative behavior of non-human primates. LITERATURE CITED Carpenter, C.
