<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction to Special Issue on Pedagogical Agents Amy L. Baylor Guest Editor Frequently, when I attempt to describe an animated pedagogical agent to an audience, I use the example of "Clippy," the (in)famous and intrusive Microsoft paper clip "help agent"; see Figure 1 . Even though I use it as a counter-example (i.e., well-designed pedagogical agents are not intrusive), the audience immediately groans, and I can feel the skepticism in the air. Even after explaining that Clippy was designed to be the front-end for a semi-intelligent help system , not a "partner" in learning, I can feel the audience's resis- tance. "OK, some people may identify or like these agents, but not me!" are the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) words. Interestingly, the level of reaction and dialogue that Clippy promotes is in itself an indicator of Clippy's powerful influence as a media-based "social actor."* Figure 1 . Microsoft's "Clippy."

Articles in This Issue Pedagogical agents as anthropomorphic interfaces for computer-based systems (i.e., interface agents) are not going away. In fact, if you speak to a young person under the age of 19 or so, they are very familiar with such "agents" (aka "avatars," or "chatbots") on cell phones, Yahoo! Instant Messenger, and in role-playing games. Such interface agents are embraced by the younger generation, as they allow for personal customization and provide a flavor of human ness through a smile, a wink, or an intelligent comment. The pedagogical agent's role on the front-end of a computer system serves as a social interface or even as a "social model," and in itself leads to powerful impacts on motivation and attitude (Baylor, this issue; Kim &amp; Baylor, this issue), and when driven by an intelligent sensor-driven system can significantly impact affective outcomes (Burleson &amp; Picard, this issue). But when pedagogical agents are specifically designed to support learning goals, do students actually learn from them? As described in this issue, intelligent tutoring systems such as AutoTutor and Marni employ intelligent agents as a human-like front-end and interact with students through natural language (Cole et al ., this issue; Graesser et al., this issue; van Vuuren, this issue). Iři such systems the adaptive instruction that the agent provides, driven by an underlying intelligent tutoring system, is a key factor for enhancing learning. To evaluate the impact of agents as "virtual peers" for literacy learning (Cassell et al., this issue); Goldman (et al., this issue) employ a "Wizard of Oz" approach where the researcher "hides" behind the scenes to control the agent, providing intelligent responses based on learner input. This approach provides a controlled way to investigate how to better sustain student long- term engagement with pedagogical agents, both adaptive and not (Bickmore, this issue; Goldman, this issue). Maldonado &amp; Nass (this issue) describe the effectiveness of employing multiple agents as "co- learners" (which they refer to as characters). The general finding that multiple agents can be more effective than one for learning outcomes is also described in Baylor (this issue) as the split-persona effect. In this issue, some interesting affordances of agent- based learning systems are also presented. "Teachable agents," where students design the underlying mental model of "Betty's brain" to effectively "teach her" science, highlight the potential of pedagogical agents as human-like peers, where teaching a visible agent is preferable over teaching the computer, per se (Blair ♦Reeves, B., &amp; Nass, C. (1996). The media equation. Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/January-February 2007 3</page><page sequence="2">et al., this issue). Other unique possibilities for peda- gogical agents include employing them as a "speech therapist" to positively impact individuals with Parkin- son's disease (Cole et al., this issue), as affective learn- ing companions (Burleson &amp; Picard, this issue), or as part of a more complex human- and agent-based network to support instruction (Hamilton, this issue). Skeptics and Possibilities In the end, even the skeptics (with memories of annoying Clippy) who assert "I wouldn't be socially influenced by these characters" would be surprised to find that they are. But rather than convincing the skeptics by anecdotal evidence, the data speaks for itself, as summarized in this issue. Further, my research has consistently found that even when learners assert that they would not be influenced by a pedagogical agent, after actually interacting with one, they are. Where do we need more research? We need more evaluation not only of agent media features but also of styles of interaction and the effective long-term use of pedagogical agents. For example, how can pedagogical agents serve as effective facilitators of learning over the course of a semester? Further, the potential for agents in online environments, e.g., to serve as discussion facili- tators or self-regulatory coaches, has yet to be explored. Overall, the field is ripe for research, not only to clarify effective design features of these agents, but also to build them to serve as simulated instructors as a controlled way to test the effectiveness of different instructional approaches. I hope this issue will stimu- late readers and future researchers to recognize the many possibilities within this exciting and quickly- evolving field. □ How to Contact Us Readers of Educational Technology are always encouraged to contact our Editors, with comments, suggestions, and news.
