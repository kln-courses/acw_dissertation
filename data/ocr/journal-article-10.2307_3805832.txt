<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GENIUS OF BARBARA JOHNSON JONATHAN CULLER Barbara Johnson never complains about the impossibility of fulfilling her assignment in the time allotted: that makes a difference between her and the rest of us. The supreme master of the twenty-minute paper, she goes strait to the heart of the issue?no filling in of background, no fussing around. She is fearless, not worried about establishing the authority to take on a new sub? ject, judging that her analysis will convince or it won't. In Mother Tongues, when she is arguing that Benjamin's messianism is the conviction that fragments must be pieced together as if they could make a whole, she writes, "At this point in my argument it was clear to me that I needed to know something about Kabbalah, the scholarly specialty of Gershom Scholem, who was Benjamin's close friend and correspondent" [62]. She then quotes a sentence from Scholem and goes on to interpret it as saying that in the beginning was contraction. She neither tries to sound like an expert nor cites others to support her authority. She just quotes the sentence. Simple, but nobody brings this off as she does. Some of us are old enough to remember the English Institute in New York City in 1977, when someone on a panel on psychoanalysis organized by Geoffrey Hartman fell ill, and this very young woman, an unknown graduate student, stepped in to talk about Derrida's reading of Lacan's reading of Poe's "Purloined Letter." This was a stunning moment?the high point in the history ofthe English Institute. It was amazingly brave for a Yale graduate student to take on these two masters, especially Derrida, who was a major presence there, and especially brave to accuse Derrida of doing precisely what he accuses Lacan of, and positively foolhardy to argue that Lacan has already reached the deconstructive insights that Derrida articulates through his critique of Lacan. This essay, "The Frame of Reference," is a formidable classic, with its compelling account of how the process of critical disagreement illustrates the transferential process of read? ing: exposing what the other missed exposes you in turn, as you find yourself pulled into that position in the structure, repeating what you denounce. There an abyssal struc? ture and a regularity of effects in which, she writes, "interpretive injustices, however unavoidable in general, always appear corrigible in detail. Which is why the sequence continues" [110]. She doesn't hesitate?another feature of her boldness?to propose a general law from what happens in this case, which lesser mortals could easily imagine to be a very special one?Derrida versus Lacan. In general, her willingness to posit as a general law what her reading of a text reveals is remarkable?more remarkable still is that she brings it off. One of her brief exemplary essays that I always teach in theory courses is the title essay of The Critical Difference ("The Critical Difference: BartheS/BalZac"). Here she identifies the general law that an alleged difference between will prove to be a projection of a difference within. Her reading of Barthes's procedure now seems so ut- terly self-evident and convincing that it poses a pedagogical problem. If students read it while they are reading S/Z, they feel that they can stop reading Barthes; they know 74 diacritics 34.1: 74-76</page><page sequence="2">exactly what is going on. Barthes's anti-constructionist, linear reading pulls him into the position of the male protagonist Sarrasine, for whom castration is a disaster, and prevents him from seeing how Balzac has already demystified what Barthes identifies as the structure ofthe classic, readerly text. This account is so compelling that I have to assign Barbara's essay a week or two later in the course so that the students will engage with S/Z before having all made clear for them by Barbara Johnson. The difference Barbara Johnson makes in a theory course like mine is that she makes theory accessible through an ideal model that is nonetheless very down-to-earth. Her essays show students that to do theory you don't need a grand theory of something or other, or vast erudition, or gnomic utterances: you can just do readings, in short es? say s that join precision and brilliance to great conceptual clarity and speculative daring. You don't have to be a Lacan or a Derrida to do theory. My theory course develops by accretion of Barbara Johnson. Each year I seem to add another essay of hers and cut out somebody else. My latest addition is her amaz- ing "Anthropomorphism in Lyric and Law," published in the Yale Journal ofLaw and the Humanities, which swiftly interprets de Man's incredibly puzzling "Anthropomor? phism and Trope in the Lyric" and sets it against Supreme Court cases about what le- gally counts as a person. She reaches the impeccable conclusion that while determining whether the corporation counts as a person supposedly takes the person as given, in fact a corporation has come to function as a model of the person, the genderless rational person?economic man, for example. She writes, "Theories of rationality, naturalness, and the 'good,' presumed to be grounded in notions of 'man,' may in reality be taking their notions of human essence not from 'natural man' but from business corporations" [573]. This wonderful essay is longer than her usual paper, and when she published it in a volume about de Man, she cut out a stunning couple of pages on the Dred Scott case, where Justice Taney decided that persons of African descent had no rights. The founders, who declared that "all men are created equal," could not have intended for slaves to count as men, otherwise they would have contradicted themselves. Summing up, Johnson writes, "Thus, enslaved African Americans could not have been included among the people because the founders were great men. . . . In order for the founding fathers to maintain their greatness, the African American has to have no rights" [566]. But these powerful pages she sacrificed when asked to cut her paper for a volume of conference papers, Material Events. Unbeholden to narcissism, she is ruthless. One of my favorite texts is the bravura performance "Muteness Envy," in The Feminist Difference. Here she reads Keats's "Ode on a Grecian Urn," with its "still unravished bride of quietness," against Jane Campion's film The Piano and the critical reception of the film, so as to explore the cultural construction and aestheticization of female muteness as a repository of feminine value. (Johnson writes, "It is no accident that every actress who has been nominated for playing the part of a mute woman?Jane Wyman, Patty Duke, Marlee Matlin, and Holly Hunter?has won an Oscar" [150]?an astonishing fact.) The feminine urn of Keats's ode is celebrated for its mute tales and melodies, sweeter than poetry or audible music. Do male poets celebrating mute speech suffer from "muteness envy," as women are said to suffer penis envy?envying that thing which they can't by definition have if they are to be poets? Lacan, notoriously, treats feminine jouissance as something about which women remain mute?"we have been begging them on our knees to tell us about it?well, not a word!" Johnson writes, the question of feminine jouissance (or lack of it) is very much at issue. By calling the urn a "still unravished bride," Keats implies that the urn }s destiny is to become a ravished bride. The word "ravished" can mean either "raped" diacritics / spring 2004 75</page><page sequence="3">or "sent into ecstasy." Both possibilities are readable in the scenes depicted on the urn: What men or gods are these? What maidens loth? What madpursuit? What struggle to escape? What pipe s and timbrels? What wild ecstasy? The privileged aesthetic moment is a jreeze jrame just prior to ravishment. But how does pressing the pause button here make us sublate the scene oj male sexual violence into a scene oj general ecstasy? How does the maiden's struggle to escape congeal into aesthetic triumph? [134-35] The tradition provides similar scenarios: when Daphne turns into a laurel tree in order to escape rape at the hands of Apollo, he gets to plucks a laurel branch as a sign of an aesthetic triumph that elides sexual violence. Glancing at some other examples of women's silence "about their pleasure and their violation," Johnson concludes that "the work performed by the idealization of this silence is that it helps culture not to be able to tell the difference between the two" [137]. But why would poets envy muteness? "To speak about female victimization is to imply that there is a model of male power and authority that is other than victimization" [152], but perhaps this is not so. After all, many white men?from Petrarchan poets to today's self-proclaimed victims of political correctness?seem "eager to claim a share in the victimhood sweepstakes." The men in The Piano are both depicted as in some sense powerless. Johnson writes, "It is in this male two-step?the axe wielder plus the manipulative sufferer, both of whom see themselves as powerless?that patriarchal power lies" [153]. Victimhood may be the most effective "model for authority, particu? larly literary and cultural authority. . . . The most highly-valued speaker gets to claim victimhood" [153]. Newsweek reported that many men felt silenced by the hoopla sur- rounding The Piano. Thus, what Johnson calls the question of "muteness, muteness, who's got the muteness" [150] moves through the dramas of our culture. Johnson shows us that reading or interpretation involves not so much judgment from a position of exteriority to the work being read as a repetition and displacement of the scenarios that structure the work and through which it draws in its readers. She does this in writing of a spareness and incisiveness that leaps daringly from the single example to the general proposition. That structure of argumentation?noth? ing could be farther from the idea of heaping up evidence until you have proved your point?marks this criticism as speculative and as theory, though it works by reading little bits of texts, always key texts that bring some interesting twist to the argument. Can this be a paradigm for the future of criticism? Since it's damnably hard to imitate it, probably not, but it provides a horizon toward which we can aspire in writing criti? cism.
