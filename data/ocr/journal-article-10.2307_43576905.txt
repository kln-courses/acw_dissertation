Whereas the Byzantines believed that the honor paid to an image passed to its prototype, Western thinkers opined that all art, be it sacred or profane, was a projection of the artist's imagination and thus false; the image was merely a reflection of the prototype and was to be considered as a metaphor or symbol. In the East images provided direct access to the prototype. As a result, the image in the West had a lower status than in the East, which gave Western artists more freedom. Henry Maguire's Nectar and Illusion: Nature in Byzantine Art and Literature sets out to show that these differing attitudes also had great influence on the depiction of nature. Up to the eighth century the Byzantines, like the early Christians before them, had had no problems with depicting nature in their churches, as can be clearly seen in the Church of San Vitale in Ravenna. Some of these nature-derived subjects were intended as sym- bols of spiritual concepts, while others celebrated the created world as an expression of the power of God in an attempt to counter paganism by inscribing all of nature under a Christian worldview (4). By the tenth century this had changed, and nature-derived im- agery was all but banned from Byzantine churches. In his book Maguire discusses how through the centuries the Byzantines perceived nature, how nature was depicted in their art, and what mechanisms caused these changes. His main thesis is that on the one hand "the Byzantines celebrated nature as a reflection of the glory of its Creator; on the other hand, they viewed the bounty of the natural world as fleeting and corruptible and sus- pected it as a distraction from spiritual reality and the permanent rewards of their faith" (3). In the book he therefore attempts "to account for the relative weight given to Speculum 88/4 (October 2013)</page><page sequence="2">1128 Reviews nature-derived and anthropomorphic images in Byzantine art of different times and con- texts" in order to show "how the Byzantines embraced or distanced nature through the manner of its representation, whether verbal or visual" (4). In Maguire's view the significant changes observed above were induced by the icono- clastic controversies of the eighth and ninth centuries (5). Both sides in the controversy accused each other of worshipping the creature rather than the Creator, a line derived from Romans 1.23-25: "And they exchanged the glory of God, who is incorruptible, with the likeness of an image of man who is corruptible, or of birds, quadrupeds, or reptiles, and they paid respect to and worshipped the creature rather than the Creator." As a re- sult nature-derived imagery became problematic (5). Although nature had been redeemed by the incarnation of Christ (59 and 64), it was also viewed as transient and false (58). The Quinisext Council of 692 decreed that Christ our God should from this time onward be rendered in human form to bring out his incarnation more clearly; and so, in Byzantine art, the representation of Christ as a lamb disappeared (86-87). As Maguire notes, in the eighth century John of Damascus posed the following question: "Is it not far more wor- thy to adorn all the walls of the Lord's house with the forms and images of the saints than with beasts and trees?" (88). After iconoclasm, therefore, from the tenth century on- ward, nature-derived images almost vanished from the decoration of Byzantine churches and more abstract compositions were favored. At the same time, icons of the saints ac- quired a prominent role (4). Gold grounds and architectural settings representing the tran- sient world (no buildings are shown in depictions of heaven) became the standard (8). The portraits of the saints were highly differentiated, iconic, and almost "naturalistic" (6). Nature, on the other hand, was abstracted and represented by colors (129), polychro- matic stones representing the variety of colors in nature (10). The interesting thing about Maguire's very readable and informative book is that it focuses as much on what is being shown as on what is being left out in the Byzantine art of successive periods. Interesting also are his observations on the differences between Western and Eastern art regarding the depiction of nature. In the West, the natural world was seen as part of God's creation, revealing something about the Creator himself. Depictions of nature were therefore far less of a problem than in the Byzantine world (104). Unfortunately, this is discussed only briefly, although the subject matter war- ranted at least a separate chapter in which the Western perspective would have been dis- cussed in more detail. It is now limited to the Libri Carolini , Johannes Scotus Eriugena, and the naturalistic leaves of the thirteenth century (Reims, Southwell, Naumburg). Moreover, I did wonder whether Maguire's representation of nature in Byzantine art was anywhere near complete. I missed a discussion of such peculiarly Byzantine saints as Simon Stylites, who hoped to conquer the elements by living atop a column, or, even more to the point, David the Dendrite, who lived in a tree. Saints like these probably have a lot to say concerning the Byzantine views towards nature, but they go unmentioned. Elizabeth den Hartog, Leiden University</page></plain_text>
