The first part of the article deals with early sources in the aniconic tradition on which Deuteronomy 4 builds, particularly the idol prohibition of the Decalogue and the altar law of Exodus 20. The second part seeks to eluci date the creative appropriation of these traditions in Deuteronomy 4 and the historical circumstances that inspired this chapter's rhetoric. Drawing on the conclusions of the previous sections, particularly the strikingly divergent cri tiques of idolatry as motivated by different historical contexts, the final section will attempt to draw some broader conclusions regarding the role of polemical strategies in establishing a distinctive cultural discourse. In his inquiry into the nature of Israel's distinctiveness, Peter Machinist has shown the difficulty of identifying any particular religious belief as unique, since the ones that are usually singled out (e.g., monotheism, universalism, etc.) are evidenced to varying degrees in the literature of other ancient Near Eastern cultures.1 But if this argument is conceded, one must nevertheless address another difficulty, namely, accounting for ancient Israel's profound influence on Western culture. In other words, if many of the fundamental ideas traditionally attributed to ancient Israel can be found in other Near Eastern cultures, why was it primarily the Hebrew Bible that succeeded in propagating them? Though several factors may be suggested, I will examine the possibility that the influence of Israelite ideas This article was completed during my research fellowship at the W. F. Albright Institute for Archaeological Research. I thank Rimon Kasher for introducing me, years ago, to several of the issues that are examined here. 1 Machinist, "The Question of Distinctiveness in Ancient Israel," in Ah, Assyria... : Studies in in Assyrian History and Ancient Near Eastern Historiography Presented to Hayim Tadmor (ed.

As recognized by Machinist, the question of distinctiveness (from the out sider's perspective) is inextricably tied to that of identity (the insiders' view of themselves). As many modern studies of identity have argued, the differences that make a difference4 are not "givens" determined by objective reality; rather, they are dependent on priorities determined by cultural discourse, both intercultural and intracultural. We should keep in mind Fredrik Barths important comments regarding the study of ethnicity: "The features that are taken into account are not the sum of objective' differences, but only those which the actors themselves regard as significant. .. . Some cultural features are used by the actors as signals and emblems of differences, others are ignored, and in some relationships radical differences are played down and denied."5 So it was not zealousness over the correct pronunciation of shibboleth that incited Jephthah's army to kill forty-two thousand Ephraimites on the banks of the Jordan (Judg 12:6) but rather the underlying political circumstances that lent this phonetic difference its dire significance. Hence, attention must be given to the rhetorical means by which a culture determines the sociological and ideological significance of a given trait.6 Further more, we must bear in mind that a culture's discourse on distinctiveness is not 2For this view, see Yehezkel Kaufmann, The Religion of Israel: From Its Beginnings to the Babylonian Babylonian Exile (trans. Moshe Greenberg; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1960), 7-121. 3Edward Greenstein hints at a similar approach in his discussion of Israelite monotheism and Canaanite religion, writing: "The God of Biblical Israel may not actually be very different from the gods of the neighboring nations, but claiming that he is, is an important part of the rhetoric promoting devotion to that God alone.... From a sociological, as well as a theological, perspective, that is a major, and possibly the major, component of Israels identity as a people" ("The God of Israel and the Gods of Canaan: How Different Were They?" in Proceedings of the Twelfth Twelfth World Congress of Jewish Studies: Jerusalem, July 29-August 5, 1997, Division A, The Bible and Its and Its World (ed.

Therefore, the study of rhetoric as defined here maintains a historical dimension, requiring both an examination of the historical setting in which the text was composed and an attempt to situate the treatment of a given set of themes and ideas vis-Ã -vis the texts predecessors in the chain of tradition. The case of aniconism in Israel provides an ideal subject for such an inves tigation. If we are to interpret the term "aniconism" broadly, we may define it as worship without the use of iconic (anthropomorphic or theriomorphic) symbols. Following Tryggve N. D. Mettinger, we may then distinguish between de facto aniconism, which tolerates iconic worship, and programmatic aniconism, which repudiates images.7 Although admittedly this distinction involves a considerable distortion of the comparative evidence and its implications,8 it rightly draws attention to the role of rhetorical marking in designating a practice as distinctive. Indeed, regardless of whether the Israelites' programmatic aniconism is understood as having developed from a broader cross-cultural tradition of West Semitic de facto aniconism, as argued by Mettinger,9 it is ultimately the rhetoric surrounding the ban on images and the sociological and theological weight attributed to it that would enable it to serve as an important basis for Israelite self-differentiation. As we shall see, however, this "program" was anything but unified. In this article, I will examine the development of the aniconic tradition in Israel with the goal of clarifying the relationship between the implicit ideology of the polemics and their historical contexts. Since a central focus will be the manner in which Deuteronomy 4 creatively appropriates earlier sources in this tradition, it is necessary to establish the diachronic relationship between the sources in question. Hence, historical and literary-rhetorical analysis will be employed as two essential, complementary aspects of a single interpretive process.10 The first part of this article deals with early sources in the aniconic tradition on which Deuteronomy 4 builds. In particular, I will focus on the idol prohibition the the Biblical World (Religion in the Modern World; Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2008), 5-19. 7Mettinger, No Graven Image? Israelite Aniconism in Its Ancient Near Eastern Context (ConBOT 42; Stockholm: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell, 1995), 16-20. 8When applied to cultures (e.g., Mari, Emar, Hatti) that incorporate stele worship side by side with iconic worship, the designation "aniconism" is incongruous, since this term is meaning ful only as part of the discussion framed by the value-laden biblical attitudes toward idolatry. See Christoph Uehlinger, "Israelite Aniconism in Context," Bib 77 (1996): 543-45. 9In itself, the comparative approach does not account for the break from "tolerant aniconism" to iconoclasm in Israel. 10See Meir Sternberg, The Poetics of Biblical Narrative: Ideological Literature and the Drama of Reading of Reading (Indiana Literary Biblical Series; Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1987), 12 23.

The purpose of this analysis is twofold: to determine the ideological aims of the aniconic polemics as related to their historical contexts and to clarify the diachronic relationship between these sources and Deuteronomy 4. The second part of this article seeks to elucidate the creative appropriation of these traditions in Deuteronomy 4 and the historical circumstances that inspired this chapters rhetoric. Drawing on the conclusions of the previous sections, particularly the strikingly divergent critiques of idolatry as motivated by different historical con texts, the final section will return to our opening question and attempt to draw some broader conclusions regarding the role of polemical strategies in establishing a distinctive cultural discourse. I.I. Aniconic Polemics in the Decalogue and Hosea: Their Rhetoric and Historical Context Any attempt to reconstruct the historical context in which a biblical text was composed must contend with the long and complex processes of transmission, oral and written, to which it has been subjected. Though careful execution of source and redaction criticism may enable distinctions between textual strata and clarify the diachronic relationship between them, frequently such conclusions are dependent on a priori assumptions that preclude any certainty. It is thus essential to supplement these methods with an analysis of the text's ideology, which may serve in many cases as a better indicator of the authors intention and historical context. One such method is "framing analysis." According to this approach, rhetorical frames serve to "highlight some features of reality while omitting others" in order to convey to the audience the issues and values that are at stake.11 These implicit issues and values can be viewed as the sources ideological subtext. To use a facile example from the modern debate regarding abortion, the rhetoric of a "pro choice" activist will tend to focus on civil liberties and female equality, whereas a "pro-life" activist will invoke a dichotomy between killing and preserving life. As can be seen, the rhetoric of each side reflects a very different set of values, often rooted in distinct belief systems and sources of moral authority. These fundamental principles are rarely spelled out. Since frame analysis exposes these implicit viewpoints, this method can offer important information about the his torical circumstances in which the rhetoric originated, divulged en passant. Since source-critical approaches often yield divergent results, this method can serve as an independent means to test their conclusions. 11 See Robert M. Entman, "Framing: Toward Clarification of a Fractured Paradigm," Journal of Communication of Communication 43 (1993): 53; see also Jim A. Kuypers, "Framing Analysis," in idem, The Art of Rhetorical Criticism (Boston: Pearson, 2005), 186-211.</page><page sequence="5">Feder:Feder: The Aniconic Tradition and Deuteronomy 4 255 If the biblical authors placed immense weight on the ban of images, modern scholarship has followed their lead, as is indicated by the heated debate sur rounding when this ban emerged and the possible existence of Yhwh idols in the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The wide spectrum of views can be grouped into three camps:12 (1) the traditional view, which attributes the prohibition of images to an ancient aniconic tradition (whether explicit or implicit) that stretches back to the Israelites' earliest history;13 (2) a revisionist view, which argues that the Israelites traditionally worshiped images until this practice was banned by the religious reforms of Hezekiah and/or Josiah;14 and (3) an intermediate position that has emerged in recent years requiring a distinction between northern and southern cults.15 Despite this variance of opinion, a broad consensus has emerged that the explicit explicit prohibition of images should not be dated before the exilic period, regardless of whether it was preceded by an implicit aniconic tendency. In particular, the Decalogue of Deuteronomy 5, including the idol prohibition, is attributed to an exilic or postexilic stratum on the basis of which the parallel in Exodus 20 was modeled. Even Mettinger, one of the staunchest advocates of the antiquity of the aniconic tradition, concedes the Deuteronomic nature of the image prohibition, leading him to distinguish between de facto and programmatic aniconism.16 At first glance, we should have little hope that an analysis of the Decalogue could clarify this matter.17 Even if the relative earliness of some sections could be 12For recent surveys of this question, see Frank-Lothar Hossfeld, "Das Werden das alt testamentlichen Bilderverbotes im Kontext von ArchÃ ologie, Rechtsentwicklung, und ProphÃ©tie," in Die Sichtbarkeit des Unsichtbaren: Zur fCorrelation von Text und Bild im Wirkungskreis der Bibel (ed.

Con versely, even if the Decalogue contains Priestly and Deuteronomistic additions, one cannot negate the possibility that this source is based on an earlier venerated Urdekalog.Urdekalog. In the following, we will explore the possibility that rhetorical frame analysis can provide a point of orientation from which to navigate this labyrinth.

Though v. 3 has frequently been distinguished from the following verses to estab lish a distinction between the "foreign-god prohibition" (the so-called First Com mandment) and the "idol prohibition" (the so-called Second Commandment), this segmentation contradicts both the linguistic and logical unity of this passage. The dependence of the "idol prohibition" on the "foreign-god prohibition" has been noted in research, though it has often been viewed as evidence for the view that v. 4, that is, the idol prohibition, is a late insertion into the context. Before discussing the rhetorical significance of this unit, we must first examine the grounds for the view that the idol prohibition is a late insertion. I will not address here the highly speculative reconstructions that are based on minor differences between these texts, such as the addition and deletions of warn in w. 4 and 5,20 since these are based on questionable interpretations and alttestamentlicheralttestamentlicher Ethik (EdF 281; Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1993); Reinhard G.

Christian Frevel et al.; QD 212; Freiburg: Herder, 2006). 18Regarding possible allusions to the Decalogue in the words of the eighth-century prophets (e.g., Hos 4:2; Amos 3:1), see Meir Weiss, "The Ten Commandments in Prophetic Literature," in The Ten Commandments in History and Tradition (ed.

Verse numbers correspond to the former. 20Walther Zimmerli, "Das zweite Gebot," in idem, Gottes Offenbarung: Gesammelte</page><page sequence="7">Feder:Feder: The Aniconic Tradition and Deuteronomy 4 257 insecure methodological assumptions.21 Two additional points, however, require closer scrutiny. The first of these is the observation that the grammatical ante cedent to the verbs in v. 5 is the plural noun "gods" in v. 3, leading scholars to conclude that v. 4 is a later addition.22 But if we recognize that the signifier "god" was used in reference to the god's cultic representation throughout the Near East,23 the "interruption" caused by v. 4 proves to be chimerical. The second argument, that the hendiadys of verbs ×©×× and ×¢×× in v. 5 reflects characteristically Deuter onomistic terminology warrants consideration.24 However, we cannot discount an alternative possibility, that this formula represents a point of continuity with earlier northern proto-Deuteronomic traditions.25 Interestingly, these two characteristics of Exod 20:4-5 appear also in Exod 23:24: ×× ×ª×©×ª××× ××××××× ××× ×ª×¢××× ××× ×ª×¢×©× ×××¢×©××× ×× ××¨×¡ ×ª××¨×¡× ××©××¨ ×ª×©××¨ ××¦××ª××× You shall not bow down to their gods to worship them nor act according to their customs, for you shall tear them down [i.e., the gods] and smash their steles to bits.

Just as here the grammar must not be interpreted as a sign of interpolation, the same goes for Exod 20:4-5. Second, we find again the hendiadys ×©×× and ×¢××.

Whether the link between the prohibition of foreign gods and that of idols are original or the product of redaction, there is no question that these prohibitions are a single commandmentâgrammatically, structurally, and logically. The subordination of the idol prohibition to the foreign-god prohibition reveals a fundamental assumption, that idolatry is the practical expression of worshiping "other gods." In other words, "having" other gods is a matter not of private contemplation but of concretely worshiping them. More importantly, the worship of idols is taken, by definition, to be the worship of gods besides Yhwh.27 By taking the equation of idolatry with foreignness for granted, this text establishes a strict dichotomy between authentic and alien worship. Accordingly, this commandment establishes a twofold exclusion of the "Other": the require ments to be separate from other peoples and to proscribe the worship of other gods (cf. Exod 23:23-24; 34:12-17). Thus, contrary to what might have been expected, the motivation that the Decalogue offers for banning idolatry is less theological than sociologicalâan implication that is explicitly elaborated on in Deuteron omy 4 (see below). An underlying supposition of the Decalogue is that idolatry is what they do. Just as Yhwh is juxtaposed to "other gods," Israel is demanded to distinguish itself from other nations. By analogy to Yhwhâdepicted as an anti god, Israel is exhorted to view itself as an anti-nation, thereby establishing the distinctiveness of both.28 In situating the Second Commandment historically, it should be compared with the anti-calf polemics of Hosea, whose relatively secure dating is crucial for understanding the development of the aniconic tradition. The key question to 26See, e.g., Ludger Schwienhorst-SchÃ´nberger, Das Bundesbuch (Ex 20,22-23,33): StudienStudien zu seiner Entstehung und ThÃ©ologie (BZAW 188; Berlin/New York: de Gruyter, 1990), 406-14; Yuichi Osumi, Die Kompositionsgeschichte des Bundesbuches Exodus 20,22b-23,33 (OBO 105; Freiburg: UniversitÃ tsverlag, 1991), 160-61.

Elsewhere, Assmann offers a provocative explanation for these negative characterizations through comparison with Akhenaten's reform. Whereas Akhenaten's iconoclasm was motivated by his naturalistic inclination to worship the Aten (sun-disk) directly, Israelite aniconism, which did not equate Yhwh with a natural phenomenon, was compelled to conceptualize the unrepresentable deity by means of an anti-imageâthrough juxtaposition with other gods and their iconic worship (Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1997], 210-11).</page><page sequence="9">Feder:Feder: The Aniconic Tradition and Deuteronomy 4 259 be addressed is this: What is the relationship between Hosea's critique and the Decalogue's image ban? Is Hosea relying on the authority of an antecedent law code, or is the law inspired by Hosea? These questions require an attempt to clarify the aspect of the Samarian calf cult that aroused the prophet's ire.29 Though some scholars have associated the calf with El,30 the evidence in Hosea points toward an identification with Baal, Yhwh, or some form of syncretism between the two. Turning to the central question of the calf's function, many scholars assume that it served as a cult statue. On the basis of this inference, they deduce that there was no image prohibition in the northern kingdom, or at least it did not include theriomorphic icons, since even Yahwistic zealots such as Jehu, Eliya, and Elisha (not to mention Amos) failed to register any complaint on the biblical record.31 Other scholars, however, have proposed that the calves were originally intended as pedestals, parallel to the cherub throne of the Jerusalem temple, arousing the criticism of Hosea only after they began to be treated as cult statues.32 Since the function of calves, or more commonly bulls, as both images and pedestals of gods is attested in the texts and iconography of Israelite and other Syro-Canaanite cultures, any conclusion must be tentative. Nevertheless, a few considerations support the assumption that northern Israelites viewed the calves as cult statues. First, even if we are to dismiss the accounts of Jeroboam's calves in 1 Kgs 12:28 and Aaron's calves in Exod 32:4,8 as being polemically motivated, one can less easily dismiss the rebuke in Hos 8:6: "An artisan made it; it is not a god." Furthermore, the description of Sargon lis campaign against Samaria in Nim rud Prism 4 (lines 29-34), in which the Assyrian king boasts of despoiling "the gods in whom they trusted" {ilÃ ni tiklÃ¯sun) has been taken as external confirma tion of the existence of iconic polytheism in Israel.33 Though Nadav Na'aman has 29For a comprehensive discussion of Israelite calf worship, see now Youn Ho Chung, The Sin Sin of the Calf: The Rise of the Bible's Negative Attitude toward the Golden Calf (Library of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament Studies 523; New York; T&amp;T Clark, 2010). 30See Nick Wyatt, "Of Calves and Kings: The Canaanite Dimension in the Religion of Israel," SJOT 6 (1992): 73-91; see also Daniel Fleming, "If El Is a Bull, Who Is a Calf?

Its people lament over it, its priests are distressed over itâover its glory for it has been exiled from it. 6It will be brought to Assyria as a tribute to a great king. Ephraim will be disgraced, Israel will be humiliated by his plan. Despite several difficulties with the MT, it seems reasonably clear that these verses refer to the calf of Beth-El being taken as tribute by the Assyrian king.35 Since Hosea elsewhere emphasizes the religious devotion surrounding this image (reminiscent of Sargons Hani tiklisun), this passage appears to offer a premonition of the fall of Samaria which closely parallels Sargon's claims in Nimrud Prism 4.36 This evidence justifies a working assumption that the official northern cult viewed the use of theriomorphic cult images as legitimate. This reconstruction is also consistent with the numerous examples of bull images discovered in northern territories, including the cult stands from Taanach (tenth century), a plaque from Dan (ninth century), and a stele from Bethsaida (eighth century). These artifacts, which exhibit extensive parallels in the Syro-Canaanite iconology of storm and moon gods, show that the Israelite worship of Baal, and probably also Yhwh, in the form of a calf or bull, draws on ancient Canaanite traditions.37 Ostensibly, this evidence could be construed as supporting the assumption that the formal image ban had not yet come into existence, but a closer look at Hoseas critique indicates otherwise.

My anger is ignited against themâ How long will they be incapable of innocence? 6For it is from Israelâ An artisan made it; it is not a god. It will be in splinters, the calf of Samaria! This passage raises several challenges to the assumption that Hosea is the originator of the image ban.39 By referring to the violation of God's "covenant" and "teaching" (v. lb), Hosea is explicitly invoking an authoritative tradition.40 Furthermore, the accusation in v. 4, "Of their silver and gold they have made idols," would have had little force if it was not taken for granted that images constitute illegitimate worship. More likely, Hosea is advocating a strict adherence to or expansion of an already widely acknowledged prohibition.41 Like the Decalogue, Hosea's rhetoric toward illegitimate cult practices is framed by an "us-versus-them" dichotomy and the equation of cult images with foreign worship (e.g., 4:4-19; 5:1-15; 11:2b; 13:1-4). From the perspective of both 38 For the MT and other versions, see Macintosh, Hosea, 307. 39For instance, Dohmen, who accepts the notion of an ancient de facto aniconism in Israel, argues that Hosea is the first Bildkritik, whose attacks against iconic worship were motivated by the fear that the use of icons in the worship of Yhwh would ultimately lead to Baal worship (Bilderverbot,(Bilderverbot, 258-62). 40See further Wolff, Hosea, 67; also Schwienhorst-SchÃ´nberger, Bundesbuch, 285. 41For example, if the prohibition was originally understood to pertain only to anthropo morphic images, it was now expanded to include theriomorphic representation. Interestingly, Brian B. Schmidt notes that the image prohibition of the Decalogue is focused on theriomorphic imagery. See "The Aniconic Tradition: On Reading Images and Viewing Texts," in The Triumph ofElohim:ofElohim: From Yahwisms to Judaisms (ed.

This notionâthe betrayal of the "jealous God" (×× ×§× ×) in the Decalogueâis developed into a full-blown allegory of the unfaithful wife in Hosea. In his investigation of ethnic sentiments in the Hebrew Bible, Kenton L. Sparks inquires: "Did Hosea reject practices associated with other deities only in foreign cultic contexts or also in Yahwistic contexts?" To this question, he responds aptly that "these practices were, from Hoseas point of view, 'negative indicia' that distinguished foreign religious practices from Israelite practice."42 In other words, practices such as image worship could not be used in service of Yhwh because they are alien by definition. Taken in conjunction with Hoseas frequent references to the exodus and wilderness wanderings of Israel (2:17; 8:13; 9:3,10; 11:1,5; 11:1,5; 12:10,14; 13:4, 5), this rhetoric may lend some credibility to the "Israelite as outsider" tradition,43 considering the Syro-Canaanite origins of bull worship. In other words, Hosea is denigrating local traditions as being foreign to authentic Yhwh worship. Even one who questions the historical validity of this claim must give Hosea credit for being consistent in his ethnic rhetoric.44 Furthermore, we should note that more formidable archaeological evidence can be gathered in support of the aniconic nature of the Judean cult, such that there may be an alternative traditionâthe authentic one in his viewâon which Hosea is basing his sectarian opposition to the northern cult.45 From his explicit references to a written Torah and the use of rhetoric similar to that of the Decalogue, it seems probable that Hosea and his audience were aware of the idol prohibition of the Decalogue. At the least, one can hardly avoid the impression that the two sources stem from a shared ideology attacking the improprieties (in their view) of the official northern cult. The sociological implications of the idol prohibition of the Decalogue find striking echoes in the allusions to this text in Deuteronomy 4. As part of its extended paraphrase of the Second Commandment, closely following its source in wording and structure,46 we find the following warning: 42Sparks, Ethnicity and Identity in Ancient Israel: Prolegomena to the study of Ethnic Sentiments Sentiments and Their Expression in the Hebrew Bible (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1998), 149-50.

If the late-eleventh/tenth-century settlement at Khirbet Qeiyafa was indeed Judean, as argued by the excavators, the fact that the three cult rooms excavated at the site (which include steles, a basalt altar, and libation vessels) have turned up no zoomorphic or anthropomorphic figures would significantly strengthen this position.

This is a clear example of how this chapter adapts its sources to its own rhetorical needs. Here the Deuteronomic text is elaborating on the implicit argument of the Decalogueânamely, the distinction between authentic and foreign worshipâand exploiting it as an argument for Israels election and the requirement that Israel recognize its distinctiveness. Specifically, aniconic devotion to Yhwh is contrasted with the astral worship that is the allotment of the nations. This point will be developed below, but first we must examine an additional tradition to which the rhetoric of Deuteronomy 4 alludes. II. The Altar Law of Exodus 20: Its Rhetoric and Relation to Deuteronomy 4 The altar law of Exod 20:22-26 in its present position serves as a transition between the preceding narrative of the Horeb theophany and the Book of the Covenant. Despite its proximity to the Decalogue, it offers a significantly different perspective on the image ban: 22×××××¨ ×××× ×× ××©× ×× ×ª×××¨ ×× ×× × ××©×¨×× ××ª× ×¨×××ª× ×× ×× ××©××× ×××¨×ª× ×¢××× 23×× ×ª×¢×©×× ××ª× ×××× ××¡×£ ××××× ××× ×× ×ª×¢×©× ××× 24×××× ×××× ×ª×¢×©× ×× ×××××ª ×¢××× ××ª ×¢××ª×× ×××ª ×©×××× ××ª ×¦×× × ×××ª ××§×¨× ××× ×××§×× ××©×¨ ×××××¨ ××ª ×©×× ×××× ×××× ×××¨××ª×× 22Yhwh spoke to Moses: "Speak thus to the Israelites: 'You saw that it was from the heavens that I spoke to you. 23You shall not make for me gods of silver, nor gods of gold shall you make for yourself. 24An earthen altar you shall make for me and slaughter upon it your burnt offerings and well-being offerings, your sheep and cattle.

Chaim Cohen et al.; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2004), 203-4; but</page><page sequence="14">264 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 2 (2013) By means of a series of oppositions, this passage emphasizes the discrepancy between idolatry and proper worship of Yhwh.48 In particular, the negative injunction against making gold and silver idols (v. 23) is juxtaposed with the positive commandment to make a simple earthen altar (v. 24). These extravagant idols, which were believed to provide earthly dwelling places for deities, are deemed superfluous for Yhwh, who speaks directly to Israel from heaven and makes only fleeting visitations to earth (w. 22b, 24b).49 By means of the redactional link in w. 22-23,50 these oppositions serve as commentaryâand modificationâof the Decalogue. This literary dependence is reflected in the reference to the divine revelation to the entire nation in v. 22 as well as in the terminology of v. 23. However, unlike the formulation of the idol prohibition in Exod 20:3, "You shall not make for yourself" (×× ×ª×¢×©× ××), which was rooted in the assumption that iconic worship of Yhwh is an oxymoron, this passage (v. 19) states, "You shall not make for me . . .×× ×ª×¢×©×× ××ª×) ×´), expressly forbidding the use of images in Yhwh's cult.51 Whereas the Decalogues idol pro hibition is based on the assumption that idol worship is alien by definition, Exod 20:23 addresses the very possibility that the Israelites will worship images of silver and gold. It is not unlikely that the placement and formulation of this passage were motivated by the need to provide a legal basis for the denunciation of the golden calf in Exodus 32, forestalling any doubts that the Israelites should have known better.52 Although much recent scholarship assumes this passage to be a Deuter onomistic (or post-Dtr) interpolation, dependent on Deuteronomy 4,53 there are compelling reasons to reverse the assumed direction of influence.54 First, the cf. Bernard M. Levinson, "The Right Chorale": Studies in Biblical Law and Interpretation (FAT 54; Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2008), 311-14. 48See further Tigay, "Presence of God," 195-209. 49See Umberto Cassuto, A Commentary on the Book of Exodus (trans. Israel Abrahams; Jerusalem: Magnes, 1967), 255; and Ibn Ezra's short and long commentaries on this pericope. 50Though the alternation between plural and singular address need not indicate distinct sources, the thematic continuity, which links v. 23 with v. 22 (the latter clearly redactional), makes this view rather persuasive. 51For this rendering of ×¢×©× + ××ª, cf., e.g., Deut 1:30 and Judg 11:27. Many scholars gloss this expression "along with me," viewing it as parallel to ×¢× ×¤× × of the Decalogue, but this rendering makes the verse superfluous. 52 Cf. Jacob Milgrom, Leviticus 23-27: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (AB 3B; New York: Doubleday, 2001), 2283-84. 53In the present context, I will not be able to engage in a full treatment of the complicated issues regarding the redaction of this pericope.

Levinson and others,56 this would also indicate that Deuteronomy 4 (generally considered to be later than ch. 12) is dependent on the altar law. Third, we should also note the significant differences between Exod 20:22-23 and Deuteronomy 4. Let us consider the relevant passages in Deuteronomy 4: 11You approached and stood under the ××ª×§×¨××! ××ª×¢×××× ×ª××ª ×××¨ ××××¨" mountain.

Despite the similarity between this passage and the altar law, several important differences can be detected. Deuteronomy 4 specifies that Israel heard God's voice from amid the fire on the mountain top, which burned "to the very heavens" (v. 11). Here Deuteronomy is taking pains to explain exactly what Israel did and did not see, in order to maintain a delicate balance between emphasizing the Graf Graf Reventlow; GÃ´ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1965), 13-4, 21; Arie Toeg, Lawgiving at Sinai Sinai (in Hebrew; Jerusalem: Magnes, 1977), 89-90, 134-35; Weinfeld, Deuteronomy 1-11, 213. See also following note. One can also consider Menahem Harans view regarding Deuteronomy's dependence on E's Horeb narrative in The Biblical Collection (vol. 2; in Hebrew; Jerusalem: Bialik, 2003), 158-63 in light of the parallelism between "you saw" (××ª× ×¨×××ª×) in Exod 20:21-22b, and the preceding narrative of Exod 19:3-4a could indicate that these constitute a single layer.

This account may also be trying to harmonize the account of Yhwh "descending" on the mountain (Exod 19:18-19) with its own references to God's heavenly dwelling.57 In contrast, Exod 20:22 states simply that the people saw that God spoke to them from heaven, without any harmonistic additions or clarifications. Furthermore, although both Deuteronomy 4 and the altar law depict the graven image as imposing limitations on the deity, they employ substantially different arguments. Whereas the altar law (Exod 20:24) emphasizes the fleetingness of God's earthly visitations ("In every place that I cause my name to be mentioned, I shall come to you and bless you"), Deut 4:12 emphasizes the invisibility of the deity: "Yhwh spoke to you from amid the fire, you heard the sound of the words, but you saw no imageânothing but the voice." Since God cannot be seen, God should not be visually represented.58 The foregoing points indicate that Deuteronomy 4 is a nuanced elaboration of Exod 20:22-24. This recognition will serve as the basis of the following comparison of the distinct ways in which Deuteronomy 4 develops the different aniconic critiques of the Decalogue and the altar law. III. The Appropriation of the Aniconic Tradition in Deuteronomy 4 Having analyzed the traditions appropriated by Deuteronomy 4, we can now evaluate how these allusions contribute to the understanding of this chapter. In previous research, much discussion has been devoted to the question of whether this chapter comprises different sources and/or layers, because of the chapter's eclectic treatment of themes and its variation between singular and plural forms of address.59 Though the question of this chapter's compositional unity is not 57The emphasis in Deuteronomy 4 on Yhwh's dwelling in heaven has recently been denied by Ian Wilson (Out of the Midst of the Fire: Divine Presence in Deuteronomy [SBLDS 151; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1995], 45-104) and Peter T. Vogt (Deuteronomic Theology and the Significance ofTorah:ofTorah: A Reappraisal [Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2006], 113-35). A crucial weakness in their arguments is their interpretation of v. 36: From the heavens he let you hear his voice . . . and on the earth he showed you his great fire." In interpreting the parallelism as implying that God dwells both in heaven and on earth, they fail to recognize that the verse distinguishes clearly between the peoples perception of an earthly theophany and the assertion that God spoke from heaven. 58Tigay, "Presence of God," 210; Friedhelm Hartenstein, "Die unvergleichliche 'Gestalt' Jhwhs: Israels Geschichte mit den Bildern im Licht von Deuteronomium 4, 1-40," in Janowski and Zchomelidse, Die Sichtbarkeit des Unsichtbaren, 49-71, esp. 67-68. 59For useful summaries, see Knut Holter, "Literary Critical Studies of Deut 4: Some Criteri ological Remarks," BN 81 (1996): 91-103; Richard D. Nelson, Deuteronomy: A Commentary</page><page sequence="17">Feder:Feder: The Aniconic Tradition and Deuteronomy 4 267 of central importance to the present discussion, it is worthwhile to consider the degree to which the heterogeneity of the chapter's form and message can be attributed to its adaptation of earlier sources in pursuing its own rhetorical goals. The main themes of this chapter are highlighted by its literary structure, which can be characterized as deliberately, though not rigorously, chiastic: A 1: Observance of Torah = life B 1-14: Giving of law as expression of intimacy60 C 15-24: Image prohibition as expression of intimacy C ' 25-31 : Violation leads to exile/distance B ' 32-40: Covenant based on dual recognition: Yhwh s uniqueness and Israel's election A' 40: Observance of Torah = life The beginning and end of the chapter frame its contents with statements equating the observance of Torah with life, thus establishing the requirement to observe the Torah as the primary message of the chapter, like that of the Deuteronomic frame in general. The intermediate sections of the chapter depict this obligation as based on Israel's unique relationship with God. In w. 1-14, the giving of the law and Horeb theophany serve as manifestations of this closeness. The final section, w. 32-40, elaborates on this theme and establishes the covenant as dependent on a double recognition: the uniqueness of Yhwh and the election of Israel. These two topicsâthe distinctiveness of God and the distinctiveness of Israelâfind expression in the chapter's allusions to the altar law and the Decalogue, respectively. The altar law asserts that God's primary dwelling is the heavens and thereby emphasizes why iconic worship, accepted by other nations, is incompatible with Yhwhs distinctive cult. The Decalogue depicts idolatry as a foreign practice that constitutes infidelity to Yhwh, such that the violation of this commandment is tantamount to a denial of Israel's distinctiveness. As intimated earlier, this notion was implicit already in the Decalogue. Deuteronomy 4 appropriates this in-group/out-group sectarian invective and translates it into a timeless doctrine of Israel's election. In effect, it has subordinated the theological pretext of the altar law and the sociological pretext of the Decalogue to the Deuteronomic program of emphasizing the covenantal commitment to the law. These allusions represent discrete voices that, by maintaining the integrity of their original message, con tribute to the intricacy and texture of Deuteronomy 4's rhetoric.

The Counter Image of Cult in Deuteronomy 4 and Its Historical Context To appreciate the full implications of Deuteronomy 4 s argument, one must consider the conventional paradigm of worship with which it was contending, namely, that of the cult. Cultic worship in Israel was based on the ancient Near Eastern anthropomorphic conception in which the temple was viewed as an earthly abode for the deity.61 The enormous expenditures and labor involved in temple building were motivated by the conviction that the prosperity and the very existence of society were dependent on the god's favor, ensured through cultic ser vice and gifts.62 This conception amounts to the wholly literal belief that closeness to the deity equals divine favor and distance implies disfavor. A clear expression of this idea is the Israelite term for offering, ×§×¨××, literally something that is brought close. It is this model that Deuteronomy 4 seeks to subvert. So far we have viewed the polemic against idolatry in Deuteronomy 4 as subordinated to the broader Deuteronomic program. However, this chapter can also be viewed inside out, such that the discussion of the Torah is taken as secondary to the central treatise against iconic worship. If we compare once again the structure of the chapter, we may notice that the dominant leitmotif is the unique closeness that characterizes Israel's relationship with Yhwh. Historically, this closeness was demonstrated by God's providence during the exodus and the Horeb theophany (w. 32-34). In the future, however, the continuation of this relationship will be dependent on Israel's observance of the law (w. 1-4, 40). The paradigmatic case for this observance is the prohibition of idolatry. Several reasons can be offered for this chapter's presentation of idolatry as the test case for Israel's observance of the covenant. Since the veneration of idols is equated with the worship of foreign gods, this act is a clear violation of this chapter's monotheistic demands. Moreover, image worship is depicted here, as elsewhere in Deuteronomy (e.g., 6:14; 28:36), as representing the danger of Israel's assimilation with its neighbors. But ch. 4 seems to be making an even more subtleâand more profoundâpoint. The notion that observance of the law will serve as the fundamental expression of Israel's commitment is itself a radical innovation and deconstruction of the traditional view that the cult constitutes 61The Sumerian term for temple, Ã.GAL, literally "big house," is the etymological and conceptual precursor to Akkadian Ã¨kallum, Ugaritic hkl (JhÃ©kalul) and Hebrew ××××, signifying "temple" or "palace."

This innovation is ironically conveyed by the two central sections of the chapter, which outline the prohibition against idolatry (w. 15-22) and the punish ment for its transgression (w. 23-31). By rejecting image worship, the accepted means of establishing a localized presence of the deity, Israel is affirming its intimate relationship with Yhwh. But should Israel be drawn into idolatry, the immediate result is exileâthe distancing of Israel from Gods inheritance. In other words, Deuteronomy 4 is standing the accepted scheme of worship on its head and establishing the law as the indispensable means of establishing closeness.64 What was the impetus for this de-emphasis of the cult and radical redefinition of worship? In the past, this question has been addressed in the context of the so-called Deuteronomistic Name Theology.65 According to these studies, the emphasis in Deuteronomy and Deuteronomistic sources on Yhwh's heavenly dwelling and the notion that (only) God's name resides in the temple has been interpreted as a response the crisis of the destruction of the First Temple, an attempt to overcome the "cognitive dissonance" of seeing the once-impregnable temple pillaged and destroyed.66 This explanation is unsatisfactory for several reasons. First, the notion of gods being exiled and returning to their temples was well established throughout the Near East. Though all of these events were tragic for their victims, they did not generate radically new conceptions of the divine presence.67 Second, the writings from the time of the destruction, such 63Translation follows Weinfeld, Deuteronomy 1-11, 193. 64See also Nathan MacDonald, Deuteronomy and the Meaning of "Monotheism" (FAT 2/1; Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2003), 197-204; Vogt, Deuteronomic Theology, 130-34. 65See above n. 57 and below n. 81. 66See Trygwe N.

Kutsko,</page><page sequence="20">270 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 2 (2013) as the books of Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Lamentations, show no hint of such a fundamental crisis. On the contrary, they face up to the bitter reality and even depict God's abandonment of the temple in vivid terms (see, e.g., Jer 7:12-14; 26:6; Ezek 11:22-23; cf. Mic 3:12). Thus, it is preferable to take Deuteronomy 4 at face value and view the confrontation with idolatry as motivating the new conception of the divine presence and cult. To understand these developments, we must briefly consider the conceptual scheme underlying iconic worship. Through analysis of firsthand testimonies, particularly the Mesopotamian "mouth washing" (mis pi) ritual texts,68 recent studies have made a significant contribution to our understanding of this belief system. As has been shown, the notion that a god could be incarnate in a statue was not viewed as contradictory to the fundamental belief in the god as a cosmic entity. Through the statue, the god could be made imminent and dwell among his earthly worshipers, but the deity remained simultaneously transcendent.69 By acknowledging the paradoxical nature of image worship, the participants were effectively immunizing themselves against the venom of potential critics, from within and without.70 Returning to the aniconic tradition in Israel, earlier sources (Decalogue, Hosea) managed to sidestep questions of belief, basing the image ban on the force of authority and through the "us-versus-them" sociological distinction. However, these tactics amount to little more than preaching to the converted. These authors seem to have known intuitively this basic sociological truth: the moment that orthodoxy is understood to be a choice, its hegemony has already been compromised.71 But there came a time when the charade could no longer be Between Between Heaven and Earth: Divine Presence and Absence in the Book of Ezekiel (Biblical and Judaic Studies from the University of California, San Diego 7; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2000), 103-23. 68Text edition: Christopher Walker and Michael Dick, The Induction of the Cult Image in Ancient Ancient Mesopotamia: The Mesopotamian mis pi Ritual (SAA Literary Texts 1; Helsinki: Neo Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 2001). 69See T.

The priests charged with the care and feeding of the gods are warned against embezzlement lest they say: "Since he is a god (i.e., a statue), he will say nothing, and he will do nothing to us" (Ada Taggar-Cohen, Hittite Priesthood [Texte der Hethiter 26; Heidelberg: Winter, 2006], 74). 71See Pierre Bourdieu, Outline of a Theory of Practice (trans. Richard Nice; Cambridge Studies in Social Anthropology; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977), 167-71.</page><page sequence="21">Feder:Feder:Feder: The Aniconic Tradition and Deuteronomy 4 271 maintained. Exposure to the belief system associated with idol worship revealed that "they" were not so different after all, since image worship was based on the same conception that underlies the Israelite cult, namely, the equation of intimacy/ closeness (blessing, protection) with physical proximity/presence.72 Unlike earlier sources, Deuteronomy 4 frames the image ban with explicit theological arguments emphasizing God's invisibility, God's heavenly dwelling, and adherence to Torah as the prime expression of religious devotion. As suggested above, these claims share the common function of undermining the traditional notion of cult. The implicit rejection of the literal notion of closeness with the deity seems to have originated from the need to differentiate more clearly the conceptual basis of Israelite aniconism from that of Mesopotamian image worship. Like so many other cases of "differentiation" in the history of Israelite religion, it appears that this new strategy was motivated by the perception of sameness with Israel's neighbors.73 This type of confrontation is vividly depicted in Psalm 115. When the psalmist pleads "Why should the nations say: 'Where is their god?"' (v. 2), he is not merely repeating the common formula for requesting divine intervention in a time of crisis (cf. Joel 2:17; Pss 42:4, 11; 79:10). Rather, this question appears here as part of a disputation with an idolater in which the latter interprets the abstractionâ that is, the nonrepresentationâof the Israelite deity as the latter's absence or even nonexistence. This equation is firmly rejected by the psalmist, who offers an alternative rhetorical frame. In the psalm's scheme, the graven image becomes an expression of limitation and weakness (w. 4-8), whereas Yhwh's nonrepresentation is taken as an expression of unlimited capability: "Our God is in the heavens / He does whatever he desires" (v. 3). Like the altar law and Deuteronomy 4, this source uses God's heavenly dwelling as an argument for the inappropriateness of iconolatry. We may now turn from our rhetorical analysis and the delineation of the ideological subtext of Deuteronomy 4 to the question of historical context. Most previous studies have ascribed this chapter to an exilic or a postexilic setting on the basis of the emphasis on exile, repentance, and redemption in w. 15-31 and the monotheistic assertions of w. 35 and 39, which find parallels in Deutero Isaiah.74 Though any conclusion is necessarily tentative,75 the present study would 72In fact, Niehr takes this similarity as grounds for assuming the existence of a statue of Yhwh in the First Temple ("In Search of Yhwhs Cult Statue," 74). 73See M. S. Smith, Early History of God, 195-202. 74See Georg Braulik, The Theology of Deuteronomy: Collected Essays of GeorgBraulik (trans. Ulrike Lindblad; BIBAL Collected Essays 2; North Richland Hills, TX: BIBAL, 1994), 196-98; Weinfeld, Deuteronomy 1-11, 223-30; Holter, Deuteronomy 4 and the Second Commandment, 110-12. 75Cf.

In view of the preceding analysis, which determined that this chapter's revolutionary noncultic conception of closeness represents a need to distinguish Israelite notions of the divine presence from those of idolatry, the Babylonian exile would be the most likely context for such a confrontation. Lacking a legitimate form of cultic expression, the exiles would be most vulnerable to the influence of their Babylonian counterparts and would need a basis to distinguish their belief system.76 V. Conclusion: The Frontiers of Polemical Discourse In the beginning of this article, I raised the question of cultural distinctive ness, particularly the problem of accounting for Israels influence in light of the existence of similar ideas in neighboring cultures. Though only a modest first step, the present study may suggest an approach for resolving this contradiction. That is, we should look not to the cultural traits or beliefs themselves to serve as objective means of distinguishing Israelite culture but rather to the relative weight ascribed to them in the polemically oriented rhetoric of the Israelite authors, who zealously sought to guard the boundary between legitimate and illegitimate belief and practice. In evaluating the cultural significance of polemical discourse, we may refer to Geoffrey Lloyds important studies on the emergence of rationalistic scientific thought in ancient Greece.77 As he demonstrates, scientific methods did not emerge spontaneously in the form of a systematic program but rather as a gradual, indirect product of crucial category distinctions in cultural discourse. In several cases, these distinctions, and the significance ascribed to them, can be attributed to the polemical rhetoric of particular intellectual movements seeking to delegitimize their opposition. For example, Lloyd writes in reference to Arisotle's emphasis on the distinction between literal and metaphoric language, Its introduction was, I said, no mere neutral piece of logical analysis, but a move in a polemic in which the introducers, Aristotle especially, sought to establish the proper criteria for proper philosophy and scienceâtheir kindâand to put down rivals (both poets and other philosophers). In terms of the influence 76 For the role of idol parodies in the confrontation with Babylonian culture, see Nathaniel B. Levtow, Images of Others: Iconic Politics in Ancient Israel (Biblical and Judaic Studies from the University of California, San Diego 11; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2008). 77See, e.g., Lloyd, Magic, Reason and Experience: Studies in the Origin and Development of Greek Greek Science (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979); idem, Demystifying Mentalities (Themes in the Social Sciences; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990). See also Jan Assmann, The Price of Monotheism (trans. Robert Savage; Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2010), 12. This comparison is for heuristic purposes, with no presumption that aniconism represents an inherently more rationalistic view.</page><page sequence="23">Feder:Feder: The Aniconic Tradition and Deuteronomy 4 273 Aristotle's ideas have had on centuries of subsequent discussion, that has been nothing short of amazing.78 Likewise, the derogatory connotations of terms such as "myth" and "magic," which emerged in no less polemical circumstances, were fundamental in the establishment of rational historiography and medicine, respectively.79 These observations pertaining to the role of discursive practices in creating epistemological self-consciousness can be applied also to the role of rhetoric sur rounding cultic practices in cultural self-definition. Many scholars have argued that Deuteronomy and Deuteronomistic sources advance a "demythologization" of earlier cultic ideas.80 Although this view has been questioned recently on several accounts,81 the present investigation would support characterizing the treatment of the cult in Deuteronomy 4 as demythologizationâwith a caveat. In Israel, we do not find a parallel to the Greek historians who explicitly labeled the writings of their predecessors mythos or a Hippocratic healer who dismissed the medicine of his opponents as magia, phenomena that could be called demythologization in the full sense. Nevertheless, the substitution of a new mode of discourse for depicting the role of the temple, such as is suggested by Deuteronomy 4 and 1 Kgs 8:27-49, for earlier literal conceptions of the divine presence in the temple has had a no less profound effect on subsequent Jewish and Christian thought. In evaluating the significance of Deuteronomy 4, one must remember that the Near Eastern notion of the heavenly dwelling of the deities was understood to be literally true. By depicting the gods as living "out there," the ancients were able to create the intuitive dichotomy between this world and the heavenly realm of the gods, though without denying the possibility that the gods could dwell in proximity to their devotees in the temple.82 By reinterpreting the embodied notion of presence that underlies the cult, the authors of texts such as Deuteronomy 4, 1 Kgs 8:27-49, and Isaiah 66 moved Western religions a step closer to the non corporeal conception of the deity that would ultimately prevail. 78Lloyd, Demystifying Mentalities, 34. 79 Lloyd, Magic, Reason and Experience, 10-125; idem, Demystifying Mentalities, 14-72. 80See, e.g., Ronald E. Clements, God and Temple (Oxford: Blackwell, 1965), 90-92; Mettinger, Dethronement, 46-47; Weinfeld, Deuteronomy 1-11, 213. 81See Wilson, Out of the Midst, 45-104; Vogt, Deuteronomic Theology, 113-35. See n. 56 above. Much argument also surrounds the "Name Formulas," which have been interpreted by many scholars as asserting a more abstract conception of the temple. See Mettinger, Dethronement,Dethronement, 39-78. For a different view, see Sandra L. Richter, The Deuteronomistic History and and the Name Theology: LesakkÃ«n semÃ´ sÃ¢m in the Bible and the Ancient Near East (BZAW 318; Berlin: de Gruyter, 2002); eadem, "The Place of the Name in Deuteronomy," VT 57 (2007): 342-66. Nevertheless, even Richter shows willingness to concede that 1 Kings 8 reinterprets the traditional notion of the divine presence (Deuteronomistic History, 215-17). 82See Edmund R. Leach, Culture and Communication: The Logic by Which Symbols are Connected.Connected.

The first of these operated according to a sociological premise, as a response to sectarian controversies within Israel, the "other-from-within." The second operated on an intellectual premise, stemming from the confrontation with the beliefs of surrounding cultures, the "other-from-without." In the first case, iconic worship in the northern kingdom was delegitimized on the sociological grounds that it represented a foreign custom. In the case of Deuteronomy 4, however, we find a theological redefinition of temple worship and an emphasis on Gods heavenly dwelling designed to differentiate the Israelite practice from idolatry. In one case, that of the Decalogue and Hosea, the polemic against idolatry aims to exclude a group of Israelites whose socioethnic closeness required special efforts to label their practices as alien. In the other, that of Deuteronomy 4, the closeness of the ideas of the surrounding culture demanded a new strategy for their exclusion. All of this brings us back to Mettinger s terminological distinction. Although de facto de facto aniconic worship can be found in many Near Eastern cultures, it is the programmatic programmatic aniconism of the Hebrew Bible that was distinctive and had such a profound impact on later Western religion. This influence can be attributed first of all to the sociological distinction of the Decalogue, which solidified vigilant adherence to the ban, but this commands impact ultimately passed into the intellectual sphere through its reinterpretation in Deuteronomy 4.</page></plain_text>
