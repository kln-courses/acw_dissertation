Harkins Abstract This article investigates how mid-thirteenth-century theologians grappled with questions of angelic embodiment and corporeal life-functioning. Regent mas ters such as Alexander of Hales, Richard Fishacre, Richard Rufus of Corn wall, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, and Bonaventure variously employed scriptural and patristic sources in conjunction with Aristotelian philosophy to develop a basic metaphysics of angels according to which these inherently incorporeal spiritual creatures assume bodies not on account of any necessity on their part, but rather simply so that we humans might understand their divinely-ordained ministries. Because the relationship between angels and their bodies is strictly occasional and extrinsic, aiming at human instruction, embodied life-functions that are natural to humans are not natural to angels. Rather, angels merely act in anthropomorphic ways in order to fittingly reveal the divine will to human comprehension. 1. Introduction In a 1995 essay in this journal surveying the doctrine on angels taught by early scholastic theologians (i.e., those teaching and writing c. 1130 - c. 1230), Marcia Colish observed that only toward the end of this period did thinkers begin to treat the metaphysical constitu tion of angels1. Whereas twelfth-century considerations of angels were generally dominated by ethical and epistemological questions, around 1220 Alexander of Hales seems to have ushered in a new era by situ ating questions of metaphysics and embodiment at the heart of his angelology and by employing Aristotelian philosophy in attempting 1.

Colish concluded her article by noting the need for a fuller study of the doctrine of angels propounded by theologians in the génération following Alexander of Haies, and by encouraging scholars to continue mapping the terrae incognitae in our knowledge of scholastic angelology3. In the decade and a half since Colish's article, a number of scholars have done precisely this by studying specific themes related to the metaphysical nature and/or status vis-à-vis bodies of angels in the thought of médiéval schoolmen. John Marenbon, for example, has considered Peter Abelard's «highly distinctive and radical theory» of angelic corporeality and place according to which angels, naturally incorporeal créatures, are circumscribable and have a quasi-spatial position by virtue of their acting in only one place at any particular moment4. Relatedly, Thomas Marschler has studied how Thomas • D 1 T_U_ ΓΛ c j - λ ,i„ ι iv|umaoj i^viiaiviiiiuv) uiiu j V/Jiii occupying place in the spatial cosmos, with a considération of the implications of their teachings for theology, metaphysics, and natural philosophy5. Tiziana Suarez-Nani has also considered the localization of angels as a part of her larger study of the nature, individuation, and cosmological function of separated substances in the late thirteenth Century, particularly in the thought of Thomas Aquinas and Thierry of Freiberg6. Bernd Roling has conducted a major study of angelic speech in the Middle Ages — from its Neoplatonic and Augustinian beginnings to Jean Gerson and Thomas de Vio Cajetan — and its theoretical Nachleben in the early modem period7. 2.

Also related to the issue of angelic embodiment, as we will see, is the question of whether and how separated spirits are able to suffer punishment by the corporeal fire of hell: in rather différent ways, Kurt Flasch, François-Xavier Putallaz, and Pasquale Porro have treated this crucial metaphysical and eschatological question in such thirteenth century figures as Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, Sieer of Brabant, Henrv of Ghent, Matthew of Aauasnarta, and Giles of Rome9. While drawing on these recent studies, the présent article seeks to broaden the scope of inquiry to a more général considération of angelic embodiment and life-functioning in the more temporally lim ited period of the mid-thirteenth Century. By looking more widely at these questions in what Colish identified as the formative period of their treatment, we seek to illuminate the larger purpose or end of angelic embodiment as understood by a select group of contempo rary scholastics.

We will see how they variously employ the scriptural witness and the teach ings of Augustine in combination with Aristotelian and Neoplatonic philosophy to construct a basic metaphysics of angels according to which these inherently incorporeal créatures assume bodies not because they themselves need bodies in order to fulfill their divinely ordained ministries, but rather simply so that we humans — rational, corporeal, and sensible créatures — might understand the purpose for which they have been sent. Because the relationship between angels and their bodies is strictly occasional and extrinsic, aiming at human instruction, bodily functions of life that are natural to human beings such as eating, engaging in sexual intercourse, and generating off spring are not, properly speaking, natural to angels. 2. Demonic Generation, Hell F ire, and Assumed Bodies Questions of angelic bodies and bodily functioning were, of course, by no means new in the thirteenth Century. In fact, when scholastic masters grappled with such questions, they did so on account of and in conversation with the preceding theological tradition, particularly in its myriad scriptural and patristic manifestations10. The canonical Scriptures of both Judaism and Christianity reveal angels, as divine messengers, engaged in a variety of apparently bodily activities in their interactions with humans. There is, for example, Gabriel's annunciation of the birth of Christ to the Virgin Mary in the opening chapter of the Gospel of Luke. Moreover, according to Genesis 18, angels appeared in human form to Abraham, shared a meal with him, and announced that he and his wife Sarah, both very advanced in âge, would have a son. Even more intriguingly, in Numbers 22 an angel speaks to the Mesopotamian soothsayer Balaam through the mouth 10. For an overview of angels and démons in Scripture and patristic thought, see S.-T. BONINO, O.P., Les anges et les démons. Quatorze leçons de théologie catholique, Paris 2007, pp. 15-71. For an inventory of scriptural and patristic texts dealing with angels and démons, see G.

Finally, as we will see, Genesis 6:1-4, together with its subséquent interpretive tradition, had perhaps the most décisive influ ence on scholastic considérations of angelic embodiment and embod ied life-functioning, certainly on questions of sexual relations and reproduction. In Genesis 6:1-4, according to some ancient Jewish and Christian Interpreters, démons or fallen angels came to earth, desired the beautiful women they found there, engaged in sexual intercourse with them, and thereby produced the giant ofifspring called Nephilim. According to this reading of the Genesis account, a reading found in the Second Temple Jewish text known as 1 Enoch, these lustful démons also introduced humankind to the magical arts and other forbidden knowledge, further examples of the great wickedness that led God to regret having created humans and to send the flood to δ 11 It must be noted, however, that the ancient Christian exegetes to whom scholastic masters looked as authorities in their theological work tended to reject this angelic interprétation of Genesis 6 — which they understood as the «Jewish» interprétation — in favor of euhemeristic alternatives12. In De civitate Dei, for example, Augustine understands the «sons of God» and the «daughters of men» as human repré sentatives of the metaphorical city of God and the city of man, respectively, rather than reading the former as fallen angels who illic itly mated with human women. Augustine also aims to blunt the preternatural aspects of interprétations like that found in Enochic literature by noting that, according to the scriptural text, there were giants (which Augustine takes simply to be humans with unusually large bodies) on the earth both before and after the «sons of God» mated with the «daughters of men»13.

Whatever contributed to Augustine's exegesis, it in turn shaped scholastic thought in significant ways.

Alexander of Haies, the first theologian to produce a formai com mentary on the Sentences and the first Franciscan to hold a chair at the University of Paris (which he assumed c. 1220)16, sets the stage for and détermines the catégories of subséquent scholastic discussions of angelic embodiment with his brief comments on distinction 8: It is asked concerning the wicked angels who appear to humans in assumed bodies whether they are united to these bodies as soûls [are united to bodies] or whether they assume the body as if it were a garment. It seems, though, that they are living beings [animalia] : they speak, they walk. Hence they do things that are consistent with living beings, for the voice is the sound of the mouth etc. Also, do not démons [acting as] incubi generate sons and daugh promulgated by Augustine can be found in the third-century Pseudo-Clementine Récog nitions and in the Chronicle of Julius Africanus (c. 160-c. 240).

And so démons are human, for it is consistent with nature that the parent and ofifspring are of the same species. It can be said that they assemble the nature with which the child is generated from the hidden seeds of things [ex occultis rerum seminibus\ and pour it into women, but they do not eut it off [décidant] from bodies that they assume. They [i.e., démons] are neither living beings [animalia] nor are they united [uniuntur] to bodies, although they move the body for the purpose of Walking, just as God spoke to Moses in a subjected créature [e.g., in a cloud or a burning bush] but was not then a [created] living being [animal\. Similarly, Gregory says in his homilies [on the Gospels] : Ά rational animal, that is an angel, announced the birth of the Lord to the shepherds,' which is explained thus: that is, an angel in the form of a human17. Alexander here aims to clarify the relationship between the wicked angels and the anthropomorphic bodies in which they appear in order to perform such human fonctions of life as Walking, talking, and procreating. Are they living beings like humans whose bodies are animated by their souls, to which they are naturally united? Particu larly noteworthy is the teaching that the nature of the offspring gen erated by démons who have intercourse with women is produced not naturally from their assumed bodies, but rather from their collecting and assembling the «seeds of things» (semina rerum) from within the earth. Alexander clarifies this doctrine in commenting on distinction 7, where Peter Lombard explains how it happened that Pharaoh's magicians were able to miraculously produce such living species as 17.

Quoting Augustine, the Lombard maintains in distinction 7 that by the keenness of their faculty of sense and fineness of body (pro subtilitate sui sensus et corporis), angels — both good and wicked — recognize the «seeds of things», which are hidden from human perception, and secretly sow them among suitable combinations of the elements in order to bring things to birth and hasten their growth19. Maaike van der Lugt has demonstrated that an Augustinian gloss on Exodus 7:11-12 concerning the demonic génération of serpents by Pharaoh's magicians that made its way into the Glossa ordinaria became particularly determinative of the way in which Alexander of Haies and other scholastics working in the first half of the thirteenth Century conceived of angelic reproduction by means of what she calls «artificial sperm/seed» («sperme artificiel»)20. What van der Lugt unaerstanas as tne orner major uieury aucsuru aL raus m me uiu teenth Century, which came to predominate in the 1240s, is what she describes as the «stolen sperm» («sperme subtilisé») theory and what I will call the succubus-incubus view21. Besides Alexander of Haies, the proponents of demonic génération by «artificial sperm/seed» include William of Auvergne, John of La Rochelle, and Hugh of St. Cher. It must be noted, however, that these thinkers generally restricted demonic génération to the production of inferior animais (as opposed to humans) based on the scriptural narrative of the magicians' mira cles and Augustine's reading of it22. Hugh of St. Cher goes so far as 18. Alexander of Hales, Glossa in II, d. 7, n. 30, p. 70. 19. Peter Lombard, Sent., II, d. 7, c. 8, n. 3: «Sed pro subtilitate sui sensus et cor poris, semina istarum rerum nobis occultiora noverunt, et ea per congruas temperationes elementorum latenter spargunt, atque ita et gignendarum rerum et accelerandorum incre mentorum praebent occasiones» (p. 363). The Lombard is here quoting ffom De Trin. III, 8, 13, where Augustine explains that «certain hidden seeds of all things which come into being corporeally and visibly lie dormant in the corporeal elements of this world» (pp. 139-141, here 140). Augustine develops his theory of rationes seminales in De Genest ad litteram, especially Bks. V and VT, where he explains, for example, how a fully devel oped tree - with its trunk, branches, leaves, and fruit - originates in a seed and its caus ative power. The seed, in combination with the elements of earth and water, produces the full-grown tree with all of its particular features (V, 23, ed. I.

He déniés, however, the taie that Merlin was produced by a demonic incubus, nor does he believe more generally that démons can generate at ail by the sécré tion of sperm23. Bonaventure, the most well-known Student of Alexander of Haies at Paris, continues his master's line of thought when he treats the power of démons {de virtute daemonum) in his own commentary on distinction 7 of Book II of the Sentences. After establishing that créatures can produce the substantial or corporeal form of things since these forms are in matter according to «séminal reasons» (rationes séminales), Bonaventure asks whether démons can induce the true forms of things24. His détermination of the question rests on two important distinctions, namely that between artificial and natural forms, on the one hand, and that between proper and alien power, on the other. Bonaventure explains that whereas démons are able to induce artificial forms (i.e., images or figures) by means of a power proper to themselves, they can induce the natural forms of things „„l„ k„ „i:„„ „„„„,25 Augustine's doctrine of séminal reasons (jrationes séminales), Bonaven tura explains that what is meant by the induction of forms by an alien power (virtute aliéna) is that a created agent joins several elements, each of which has its own natural power, together to produce a new thing. A farmer, for example, causes his crop to grow simply by plant ing a seed in the earth and watering it regularly: since the crop is produced by a power proper or natural to the seed in combination with soil and water (and the power proper to each of these elements), the farmer is said to produce the crop only by a power alien to him self. Properly speaking, then, the natural forms of things are produced only by the divine Creator or by the created natures themselves. Only God and the things God has created (in this case, a seed, earth, and water) operate according to the mode of nature {per modum naturaé). 23. Van der Lugt, Le ver, pp. 263-269. 24.

Similarly, Bonaventure affirms, evil spirits operate according to the mode of an art, namely magie, in producing the natural forms of things such as snakes, frogs, and presumably offspring from human women26. In his third and final question on the power of démons, Bonaventure asks whether anyone can use the magical arts without sinning. «It must be said», he concludes, «that the magical arts or divination are not able to exist without sin, nor can the counsel or even the help or ministry of the devil be sought without sin»27. That the magical arts represent the forbidden ministry of the démons whereby miraculous works can be performed was a médiéval commonplace, one that clearly echoes the Enochic tradition of the fallen angels' having intro duced humankind to sorcery, magie, astrology, and similar arts28. Ifwe return to Alexanders comments on distinction 8 and reread them in light of Bonaventure's treatment and the «artificial seed» theory more generally, the former's explanation of demonic généra tion becomes clearer.

But exactly who the wicked angels are vis-à-vis the bodies that are somehow theirs and precisely how they do what they do in these bodies — including engage in sexual intercourse with women — are questions that Alexander does not answer definitively.

Confirmation and further explanation of this relationship is found in the Summa théologie a or Summa fratris Alexandri that has been traditionally attributed to Alexander of Haies, a synthesis perhaps begun and redacted by Alexander but completed by others in the Franciscan school after his death29. The Summa fratris Alexandri divides its général treatment of the movement of angels in assumed bodies in the First Part of his Second Book into two chapters, the first on the assumption of bodies and the second on particular acts that angels perform in their assumed bodies30. The author begins the first chapter by establishing that an angel does not naturally possess a body, but simply assumes one for the sake of performing those activities or opérations that he works among and for the sake of humankind. The assumption of a body, then, is not a necessity inso far as the angel himself is concerned, but it is required in order for the angel to imprint on our senses31. Noting that the Lord sometimes spoke to the Patriarchs of the Old Testament through angelic média tion, the author makes clear that the angel assumes a created body to himself for the purpose either of making himself, an innately spiritual and incorporeal créature, manifest or of revealing God32. The union of the angel to the body is not like that of perfection to its perfectible, 29. On the dating and authenticity of the Summa fratris Alexandri, see M. GORCE, «La somme théologique d'Alexandre de Haies est-elle authentique?», in: New Scholasticism 5 (1931), pp. 1-72; C. M. Cullen, «Alexander of Haies», in: J. J. E. GRACIA-T. B.

Bonaventurae, t. 4, Quaracchi 1948, pp. LIX-LXXXI. Although the questions of Alexander himself likely served as one source for the material that came to constitute the first three books of the Summa fratris Alexandri, which books were compiled prior to Alexander s death in 1245, so many questions of authorship and authenticity remain unanswered that we certainly cannot assume that Alexander is the author or even compiler of the entire Summa.

Furthermore, accord ing to the Summa fratris Alexandri, the angel does not assume evety body that he moves, but rather only those that he moves for the purpose of self-manifestation or divine révélation34. The author explains that the body that the angel assumes is taken or formed from air: whereas the good angels assume bodies from the purer upper atmosphère or ether, the wicked angels assumed bodies from the lower atmosphère which is properly called air35. Here the Summa fratris Alexandri follows Augustine, who teaches that demons are «airy animais» (aeria animalia) who prior to their transgression either inhabited the higher région of the air and as such had bodies of purer air, on the one hand, or inhabited the celestial région and had bodies of fxre, on the other. Either way, in Augustine's view, after their sin they were «thrust down into this misty darkness, where tnere is nevertneiess air Dut ît is interwoven witn a urne moisrure» . These foggy régions serve as a prison (carcer) for them until the time of judgment, Augustine teaches37. When Bonaventure asks, in commenting on distinction 6 of Book II of the Sentences, «into what the fallen angels feil », this Augus tinian understanding appears determinative. Invoking Ephesians 2:1-3, which describes the devil as the ruler of the power of the air, Bon aventure teaches that the ordinary place of the démons after the fall and until the judgment day is not the subterranean région known as hell, but rather the foggy air. «Whether some of them were thrust down into hell», he concédés, «I do not know, nor do I find it deter mined by the saints. But I certainly believe that some descend [there] in order to torment soûls according to the duties of punishment that 33. SfA, Lib.

Although the author provides no examples of unions of «perfection to its perfectible», he likely has in mind the hypostatic union of the divine Word to human nature in Christ or the rational soul to the body in ordinary humans. 34.

Invoking Augustine's view that God turns the evil committed by créatures to good use, Bonaven ture explains that God provided the région of the foggy air for most of the fallen angels, rather than consigning them to hell, in order that they might both help to train humans in obedience and have a con text for their own training in obedience39. The misty air was a fitting destination not only because its fogginess is appropriate to the dark ness of the angels' fault, but also because its fluidity and fineness is conducive to the speed of angels, who «as has been revealed to certain holy men, frequently circle around us like flies»40. Bonaventure's teaching concerning the place of the fallen angels echoes not only Augustine's, on which it directly dépends, but also that of Jude 6 and 2 Peter 2:4 which teach that God has cast the fallen angels into darkness until the day of judgment41. Bonaventure teaches that the punishment of the fallen angels by fire will be postponed until after the judgment. The fact that the majority of wicked angels have not fallen into hell prior to the judg ment, but rather into the foggy air, poses a problem for the view of some médiéval thinkers that the angels are tortured by material fire immediately followine their fall. It does not make sense (non intelli gibilé), Bonaventura notes, that the fallen angels would move them selves around (everywhere they roam) in a burning fire unless from the time of their first fall they had bodies inseparably fitted to them in which they are punished42. The problem with this view, particu larly in light of Bonaventure's previous question, seems to be twofold: 38. BONAVENTURE, Comm. in II, d. 6, a. 2, q. 1, corpus, p. 164: «Utrum autem aliqui detrusi sint in infernum, hoc ego nescio nec invenio a Sanctis determinatum.

Cf. the opening Unes of De civitate Dei, XI, 18, p. 337, which Bonaventure quotes as an authority here. 41. Although neither Augustine nor Bonaventure invokes Jude 6 or 2 Peter 2:4 in their discussions, in describing the place of the angels' punishment prior to judgment they both use forms of the word caligo, darkness or fog, which is the very word used in the Vulgate of Jude 6. 42.

HARKINS first, angels do not have bodies inseparably attached to them, but rather assume bodies for the sole purpose of performing specific functions commanded by God; and second, the wicked angels feil not into the région of fiery torment (viz., hell), but into the foggy air. With regard to the first difficulty, Bonaventure elsewhere explains, in line with the teaching of the Summa, fratris Alexandri, that angels (whether good or evil) have bodies neither naturally united to them nor inseparably attached43. As evidence, he cites the Gerasene demonic of Mark 5, who was possessed by a great multitude of demons (in fact, by a «légion», understood as 6,666): «If demons had bodies, they could have in no way entered by stealth so small a body [as this man's] with their own bodies»44. What Bonaventure takes to be the more probable thirteenth-century position on when the angels will undergo punishment by fire maintains that it will be postponed unni arier me juagment, «not oniy so mat tneir traming [m odcui ence] might not be omitted, but also so that divine mercy might be shown»45. The question of how fallen angels, inherently incorporeal créatures, are able to experience the torments of material fire still remains, how ever, and is taken up by Bonaventure in his commentary on distinc tion 44 of Book IV of the Sentences. The more basic philosophical problem of how purely spiritual substances like separated human soûls are able to suffer the fire of hell is an ancient one, dating back at least to the second Century C.E. The early Christian apologist Jus tin Martyr, for example, maintained that hell fire can act on the evil human person only after the général résurrection when he or she again possesses a body; the separated soul, as pure spirit, simply has no capacity to experience the effects of physical fire46.

In the case of Bonaventure, too, we see an attempt at such doctrinal elasticity. In commenting on Book IV distinction 44, he sets forth the various views concerning «whether the fire of hell afflicts the spirit» before determining the question himself48. Whereas some thinkers (most notably, Aristotle and Averroes) denied that an incorporeal spirit such as an angel or a separated human soul could suffer forment at all on account of its immutability and incorruptibility, the position of «other modern philosophers» such as the Muslim Al-Ghazali (whom Bonaventure explicitly names) was that a spiritual substance can suf fer through the privation of something that it desires (like the highest Good) although not through the action of some agent (like material fire)49. Against both of these views, Bonaventure invokes Matthew 25:41 (in which Christ says, «Go, you accursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels») as evidence that «the Christian faith déclarés that separated spirits suffer punishment not merelv throuvh the ahspnrp of thp kiofipsr Doorl knr alco tkroinrk the presence of a tormenting agent»50. Central to Bonaventure's explanation of how this happens is the distinction between the order of nature (ordo naturaé) and the order of divine justice (ordo divinae iustitiae). Whereas a spirit without a body cannot suffer the torments of material fire according to the order of nature by virtue of the fact that such spirits are naturally superior to fire, torture by fire is a possibility for a spirit according to 47.

It is important to note that subséquent to Bonaventure's Sentences commentary, Étienne Tempier twice condemned the proposition that after death the separated soul in no way suffers from corporeal fire (viz., on 10 December 1270 and 7 March 1277). 50.

For the sake of justice, God binds the spirit and the fire indissolubiy, shutting the spirit up in the fire as in prison (ut in carcere)51. Locking the spirit into a fiery prison, «divine justice... makes transgressors tremble by sending them into panic and dread [terrorem et horrorem] of a thing to which by nature they are superior»52. Thus, the spirit expériences genuine terror and horror, and through these true pain, from material fire. Although this hap pens according to the order of divine justice, Bonaventure is quick to point out that such a purposeful uniting of incorporeal spirit with a material substance is not contrary to the order of nature. In fact, just as God joins the spiritual soul with a body in order to give every person life and enable the human soul to experience love, so too does God join the spirit to fire in hell as the means of eternal punish ment53. For several of our scholastics, the fact that the devil and his min ions would be tormented in hell suggested that angels do, in fact, have bodies. For example, Richard Rufus of Cornwall, a Franciscan master at Oxford who lectured on the Sentences around 125054, main tains: «It seems that the devil is not able to suffer from corporeal fire in hell unless he has a body. But he suffers without a doubt, and the fire of hell is corporeal. Proof: Augustine says On the City of God Bk. 21 ch. 6: 'That hell, which is called the lake of fire and of sulphur [Rev. 20:19], will be a corporeal fire.' Therefore ... it follows that they [i.e., angels] have bodies»55. After offering reasons both for and 51. BONAVENTURE, Comm. in TV, d. 44, p. 2, a. 3, q. 2, corpus, p. 934. 52.

Similarly, Albert the Great, the Dominican teacher of Thomas Aquinas who delivered his Sentences lectures before becoming a master in 1245,57 maintains: «The Fathers seem to think différent things concerning this [question], and it is not clear to me which position I should teach, and I admit that I do not know»58. Albert proceeds to side with many «Catholic doctors» who hold that whereas angels do not have their own natural bodies, they do assume bodies «according to the will and ordination of God» (pro voluntate et ordinatione Dei)59. According to Albert, an angel's adjoined body, which he uses to carry out the divine purpose, can be either organic (i.e., he can operate through an ass or a serpent, for example) or formed exclusively according to his mission (as was the case with the bodies of the three visitors to Abraham)60. Roughly contemporary with Albert's Sentences commentary and the Summa fratris Alexandri is the commentary of the English Dominican Richard Fishacre, the first Oxford theologian to comment on Peter Lombard's collection, likely producing his work between 1241 and 124561. Not surprisingly, then, Fishacre résolves the question of angelic bodies in much the same way as Alexander and Albert: «Therefore we say that they [i.e., angels] do not have bodies naturally united to them, but [rather] for a great diversity of 56.

HARKINS ministries they produce bodies for themselves and clothe themselves with them, just as we make and clothe ourselves with garments. Since, however, there is no union between me and my garment, it is not natural to me»62. Ail of our theologians, then, understand the bodies of angels to be assumed and occasional rather than natural and per manent: each angel takes to himself a particular kind of body that is well-suited to his divinely-ordained task, much as we humans put on shorts and a T-shirt to exercise but a suit for a job interview. 3. Convenientia ad nos : Angelic Embodiment and Human Instruction But here a philosophical conundrum arises: namely, if angels are naturally incorporeal, spiritual créatures (as Augustine, John Dama scene, Pseudo-Dionysius, and many other prominent Christian theo logians had taught), isn't their assumption and use of a material body necessarily unfitting, even problematic? Isn't there a fundamental disproportionality between an angel and a body? After all, Aristotle teaches that the opération of a purely intellectual créature can neither dépend on nor dérivé from a body63. Furthermore, the Aristotelian principle that the simpler way is better implies that angels, who cer tainly are able to operate without bodies, should in fact do precisely that64. Albert the Great addresses these objections in question 75 of the First Part of his Summa theologiae, where he treats questions of angelic bodies and their opérations in considérable detail. «It must be said», Albert begins the solution of membrum or article 1, «that on this question the Philosopher is able [to say] little or nothing. And therefore we must rely wholly on the authority of the saints and the biblical writings»65. Scripture clearly teaches, he proceeds to explain, 62.

Because we are corporeal créatures and, as such, are instructed more easily concerning heavenly things by means of corporeal likenesses, it is «fitting for us» (convenientia ad nos) that angels assume bodies66. And indeed, the bodies assumed by angels indicate to us humans what they have corne to do concerning us. If they corne to protect us from ambush, Albert explains, they assume the forms of agents of war, as in 2 Kings 6:17: «Behold, the mountain was füll of horses and chariots of fire ail around Elisha». Or in Tobit 5, Raphael appeared as a young man ready for Walking in order to teach Tobit that he would lead his son Tobias safely to Media67. This seems quite reasonable. But why an angel spoke through the mouth of Balaam's ass in Numbers 22 still remains inexplicable. Because the tongue of an ass is certainly not the necessary instrument for the formation of speech, objection 6 makes clear, this angel did not need to assume the organized body of an ass. Albert responds to this objection by maintaining that angels with respect to themselves in no way need bodies and the natural faculties of these bodies in order to carry out particular functions; they can utter articulate expressions, for example, without forming them by means of a tongue (e.g., they can speak through burning bushes or clouds, as Scripture attests). But with respect to us they do need bodies, in order that we might be taught in the way that is «most fitting» for us68. And we are most accustomed to hearing and understanding language pro duced by means of the corporeal mouths of animais (albeit ordinarily the mouths of rational animais). Genesis 6:1-4, together with other canonical texts in which angels appear to eat and speak (e.g., Gen. 18:1-15 and Tob. 12:19), pro vided the occasion for scholastic theologians to reflect on the func tions of life that angels are able to perform in their assumed bodies. 66.

HARKINS Can angels with their assumed bodies walk, speak, eat, engage in sexual intercourse, and generate offspring? Thomas Aquinas addresses such questions in several of his works, from his early Scriptum on the Sentences (originating as lectures delivered at the University of Paris in 1252-56) to his mature Summa theologia/'''. In the Scriptum Aqui nas, like Alexander of Haies before him, explains that the relationship between an angel and his assumed body is a metaphysically loose and extrinsic one, which has conséquences for corporeal fonction on the part of the angel: It must be said that... angels do not pour life into their assumed bodies, but rather merely movement: and therefore it must be held that no opérations which accompany a living body inasmuch as it is living can pertain to angels in their assumed bodies, but only those which accompany a mobile body inasmuch as it is movable, such as moving, pushing, dividing, and things of this sort70. For Thomas, then, embodied angels can perform only those functions of life that require motion and only to the extent that those functions can be accomplished by means of simple motion. He explains, for example, that an angel is not able to truly eat by virtue of the fact that he cannot perform all of the opérations that are essential to eating: namely, cutting food with the teeth, swallowing it with the throat, digesting it in the stomach, and Converting it into fuel for the body. Whereas the embodied angel can chew and swallow his food, his body simply does not have the capacity of a truly living body to process food and incorporate it into that selfsame body (although Thomas is quick to point out that «by some power of the angel» the swallowed food is dissolved into previously inactive or unformed matter)71. 69.

In commenting on distinction 30 of Book II of the Sentences, Thomas discusses three opinions on the ques tion of «whether food passes over into the truth of human nature»72. According to the first position, that of Peter Lombard, food is not con verted into the truth of human nature at all; rather the truth of human nature consists completely in the original séminal material that the indi vidual received from his or her parents. On Thomas's reading of this position, food simply protects the flesh from being consumed by vital heat rather than either augmenting or restoring the body73. The second position maintains that the human body possesses a primary séminal component that is fixed and endures throughout one's life, but that the rest of the body (i.e., the secondary component) consists of material that is subject to wastage and renewal. On this account, food is converted into the truth of human nature only secondarily, that is, only with respect to this second component74. The third position, that of Aristotle and Averroes, holds that food truly and completely becomes the truth of human nature precisely because there is no material part of the body tknt ιc fivp/ί anrl normnnfnt1 rotlipr oïl knrl ilrr mnH-^r te ci ιc/~i=»r-\t-iklp f-n wastage and restoration75. Aquinas claims this third view as his own, thereby highlighting the indispensable rôle of eating to both nourish ment and nature among humans. Finaily, it is significant, as a préludé to our considération of his teaching on demonic reproduction, that Thomas also follows Aristotle in maintaining that human semen is entirely a byproduct of food and the digestive process76.

Thomas's refusai to admit that angels truly eat accords with the Summa fratris Alexandri, which had earlier arrived at a similar conclu sion regarding angelic eating by a différent route. The author of the Summa fratris Alexandri, following Augustine, distinguishes between the necessity and the power of eating. Whereas angels do not eat out of any necessity of nourishing their assumed bodies (which are constituted of air, it must be recalled), they do truly eat inasmuch as eating pertains to the power or revealing G od to those humans with whom angels share meals77. As one of the objections affirms, it is an abomination (nefas) to believe that in angels food moves into the stomach and is expelled through the intestines (i.e., that these divine messengers digest and defecate)78. The précisé words of the archangel Raphael to Tobit, «I appeared [videbar] to eat with you, but I use invisible food» (Tob. 12:19), provide compelling scriptural évi dence in support of the view of the Summa fratris Alexandri — and Aquinas — that angels eat only insofar as they chew and swallow their food (i.e., divide and move it locally)79. Thomas's teaching on angelic eating (or non-eating, more prop erly) is in line with that of his master, Albert. Albert begins article 5 on distinction 8 of Bk. II of his Sentences commentary (which asks whether angeis are able to eat) with this affirmation: « f hey seem to truly eat because Abraham the Patriarch, who was spiritual and prob ably had discernment, offered them food and they ate»80. A second objection Albert raises is that it is not Utting or suitable for angeis, 77. Sfii, Lib.

On the other hand, to believe that angels digest and incorporate food before excret ing waste is absurd82! Echoing the Summa fratris Alexandri, Albert answers that angels do not truly eat. But neither do they deceive us in appearing to eat, he explains, since they intend such corporeal actions to refer to «some spiritual and moral [reality]»83. The three angelic visitors to Abraham, for example, appeared in anthropomor phic bodies in which they seemed to eat in order to show forth the ministrv nf îhp Triiinp Or»rl anrl Mis rnmmuninn wifh ne hnmonç Abraham served his guests food, Albert explains, because he did not recognize that they were angels with such a purpose until after the meal. That he did not recognize their angelic nature and ministry right away is «not unfitting [for a patriarch], nor does it demonstrate less sanctity [on his part] », Albert teaches84. Finally, let us return to the question with which we began, namely whether angels can procreate or generate offspring. Here Aquinas's thinking is guided by the aforementioned principle that angels can perform only those life-functions that require simple movement. Furthermore, it is this metaphysical hermeneutic that helps Thomas navigate the contested intellectual terrain between the strictly human Sethite interprétation of Gen. 6:1-4 represented by Augustine, on the one hand, and the angelic Enochic one, on the other. In the Scriptum, Aquinas writes: Some say that démons in their assumed bodies are in no way able to procre ate; and that 'the sons of God' do not signify angels [acting as] incubi, but rather the sons of Seth, and that 'the daughters of men' signify those who descended from the race of Cain. But because the contrary is held by many, and [because] what seems true to many cannot be entirely false according to the Philosopher..., it can therefore be said that by their [i.e., the démons'] action génération is completed inasmuch as they can put human semen in a place appropriate to the corresponding matter, just as they can also bring 81.

HARKINS together the seeds of other things in Order to bring certain effects to frai don.... So only what is local motion is attributed to them, not however génération itself, the beginning of which is not the power of the démon or of the body assumed by him, but rather the power of that one whose semen it was. Hence the one born is not the demon's, but rather is the son of a certain human85. Although Thomas in no way rejects the Sethite reading of Genesis 6 here, he appears to give greater credence to what he understands as the more populär angelic interprétation found in 1 Enoch (whereas «some» or «certain people» teach the former, «many» hold the lat ter). Just as canonical Scripture reveals that angels eat and speak, so too the sacred text depicts the fallen angels engaging in sexual relations with women and thereby producing offspring. For Thomas, as for Alexander of Haies, however, the embodied démon acts merely as an aneelic instrument of what is essentiallv human Generation. The reader of Genesis 6 must recognize, as Tobit failed to do regarding Raphael, that where angelic fonctions of life are concemed appearances can be quite deceiving, an issue to which we will return momentarily. In the First Part of the Summa theologiae and in the disputed ques tions on the power of God (De potentia Det), both of which date to the period 1265-68, Thomas forther explains what appears to be angelic intercourse as recounted in Genesis 6. In article 3 of question 51 of the First Part (which asks simply whether angels in assumed bodies exercise the fonctions of life), Aquinas briefly describes the succubus-incubus theory, which relies on Augustine's doctrine of sém inal reasons: just as démons artificially collect and bring together the seeds of things in combinations that enable these seeds to naturally produce certain effects, so too can they move human semen from a 85. THOMAS Aquinas, Scriptum in II, d. 8, q. 1, a. 4, sol. 2, p. 212: «Ad id quod secundo quaeritur, dicunt quidam quod daemones in corporibus nullo modo generare possunt; nec per filios Dei angelos incubos significari dicunt, sed filios Seth, et per filias hominum eas quae de Stirpe Cain descenderunt. Sed quia contrarium a multis dicitur, et quod multis videtur non potest omnino falsum esse, secundum Philosophum, in VII Ethic., cap. xiv, et in fine Desomn. et vig., ideo potest dici quod per eorum actum comple tur generatio, inquantum semen humanum apponere possunt in loco convenienti ad materiam proportionatam, sicut etiam semina aliarum rerum colligere possunt ad comp lendum aliquos effectus, ut in praecedenti distinctione dictum est; ut attribuatur id tantum eis quod est motus localis, non autem ipsa generatio cujus principium non est virtus daemonis, aut corporis ab eo sumpti, sed virtus illius cujus semen fuit; unde et genitus non daemonis, sed alicujus hominis filius est».</page><page sequence="25">THE EMBODIMENT OF ANGELS 49 man into a woman in order that offspring might be generated. Such simple local motion, which for Thomas clearly is the purview of embodied angels, is achieved when the wicked angel assumes a female body in which he receives the man's semen in ordinary intercourse (thereby acting as succubus), before then assuming a male body from which he deposits the same semen into a human woman through another sexual encounter (in which he acts as incubus)86. Thomas's Latin here reveals his understanding of the relationship between the «artificial sperm/seed» and «stolen sperm» views of demonic génération. In question 51 of the Prima Pars of the Summa theologiae, he explains: Si tarnen ex coitu daemonum aliqui interdum nascuntur, hoc non est per semen ab eis decisum, aut a corporibus assumptis, sed per semen alicuius homi nis ad hoc acceptum, utpote quod idem daemon qui est succubus ad virum fiât incubus ad mulierem; sicut et aliarum rerum semina assumunt ad ali quarum rerum generationem, ut Augustinus dicit, III de Trin. ; ut sic ille qui nascitur non sit filius daemonis, sed illius hominis cuius est semen acceptum87. Similarly, in question 6 of De potentia, Thomas writes: Quibusdam vero videtur quod generare possunt, non quidem per semen a corpore assumpto decisum, vel per virtutem suae naturae, sed per semen hominis adhibitum ad generationem, per hoc quod unus et idem daemon sit ad virum succubus, et semen ab eo receptum in mulierem transfundit, ad quam fit incubus. Et hoc satis rationabiliter sustineri potest, cum etiam alias res naturales causent, propria semina adhibendo, ut Augustinus dicit (in III de Trin., cap. VIII et IX)88. That Thomas twice invokes Augustine's doctrine of séminal reasons as a basic template for understanding putative demonic génération by means of a succubus-tumeà-incubus suggests that van der Lugt's con ception of «sperme artificiel» and «sperme subtilisé» as two compet ing and mutually exclusive théories should be reconsidered. Of mid-thirteenth-century thinking on this issue, van der Lugt writes: «La théorie de la semence artificielle étant définitivement réfutée, les théologiens se concentrent alors sur l'hypothèse de l'insémination de sperme humain par les démons.

HARKINS Grand, d'Eudes Rigaud, de Bonaventure et de Thomas d'Aquin cette théorie acquiert sa forme définitive»89. Whereas these thinkers cer tainly found «stolen sperm» or artificial insémination a more compel ling explanation, particularly in light of the long tradition that denied démons the ability to produce superior créatures by «artificial sperm/ seed», Thomas's accounts of this theory in the Summa theologiae and De potentia clearly indicate that he understood it as complementary to, rather than in compétition with, the notion of «artificial seed». Indeed, in both works he simply assumes the wide acceptance among his readers of the truth that démons generate natural realities from the seeds of things that they obtain, and seeks to use the truth of this view as a kind of proof for demonic procréation by artificial insémina tion. For both Thomas and Albert, then, the succubus-incubus theory can aptlv be read as a technical explanation of preciselv how, in the specific case of a human male and female, demons gather the seeds of things and combine them to produce a new being. For Albert, however, succubi and incubi are not simply explanatory realities that remain safely confined to the realm of theory. In fact, Albert intriguingly relates having heard about people who actually have had sexual encounters with demons in this way. He writes: «We see persons icnown carnally by them, and places in which a man is hardly ever able to sleep through the night without a demonic suc cubus coming to him. Similarly, public rumor concerning Merlin, the son of an incubus, bears witness to this, so it seems»90. In formulating his own teaching on angelic intercourse and génération, it appears that Thomas learned much from his master's detailed treatment of this question in his Sentences commentary. Albert begins by asking where the semen used in angelic génération originates. According to Aristotle and consequently the medicine of Albert's day, the spirit of life is contained in the viscosity of semen, so knowing the source of the sperm is vitally important. It does not originate in the body of the incubus by virtue of the fact that assumed angelic bodies do not 89. Van der Lugt, Le ver, p. 273. 90. ALBERTUS Magnus, Comm. in II, d. 8, a. 5, quaest., p. 97: «Ex opposito etiam quaeritur de angelis malis, utrum generent. Videtur autem quod sic: quia verissime legitur de ineubis et succubis daemonibus: et vidimus personas cognitas ab eis, et loca in quibus vix unquam per noctem potest dormire vir, quin veniat ad eum daemon succubus. Item, rumor publicus de Merlino filio ineubi testatur hoc, ut videtur».</page><page sequence="27">THE EMBODIMENT OF ANGELS 51 have the natural power to produce sperm. (Albert sets forth a fascinat ing theory according to which human semen is produced from the largest organs in the body — the brain, the liver, and the heart — organs that the assumed bodies of angels do not need and therefore do not have91.) Albert also makes clear that the sperm used by the irtcubus does not come from the body of a dead human assumed by the démon. The theory of some apparently was that the démon makes the sperm from a dead human body by moving and liquefying élé ments of this deceased body which he had assumed. «Contrary to this view», Albert afFirms, «is [the fact] that [the body assumed] is dead: and if the démon were to melt the entire [body by means of motion], he could not produce semen suitable for génération»92. Another view maintains that semen is, in fact, not necessary for reproduction. This view is supported by Isidore of Seville's teaching that mares on the island off of Portugal, presumably San Miguel or Madeira, conceive from the wind. Against this view, Albert déclarés: «This is not worth mentioning because he does not say that women are able to do this from the wind, and we are discussing the conception of women by démons. Furthermore, Isidore says many things in his book on ani mais \at ammauous\ tnar nave not Deen wen proven»'". ine nnai view, which Albert eventually affirms as probable and hands on to Aquinas, is the succubus-incubus theory: the semen originates in a human male from whom the demonic succubus takes it and then as incubus he transfers it into the human mother-to-be. At first glance, 91. On the production and information of semen according to Albert, see REYNOLDS, Food and the Body, pp. 250-253. Like Thomas after him, Albert maintained that semen was a byproduct or superfluity of food in its final stage of digestion. For Albert, this superfluity cornes from ail over the body, but especially from large organs such as the brain. Reynolds here explains what Albert and other scholastics intend by the verb «to separate» (descindere) or «to eut off» (decidere) when used of semen: «To separate (ιdescindere) semen, therefore, is to do three things: to attract highly digested, superfluous nutriment to a particular organ [namely, the testicles]; to cause it to 'ripen' (maturare) there; and to infuse into it a formative power that is able to transmit the likeness of [the] generator's species to the mother's womb» (p. 251). 92. ALBERTUS Magnus, Comm. in II, d. 8, a. 5, quaest., p. 97: «Contra hoc est, quod mortuum est: et si totum liquesceret, non faceret semen aptum generationi». 93.

Praeterea, Isidorus dicit multa in libro illo de animalibus, quae non bene probata sunt».</page><page sequence="28">52 F.T. HARKINS this way of doing things seems unlikely to produce offspring, Albert explains. Indeed, even on its long and inhospitable journey toward the unfertilized egg, semen released during normal human intercourse often evaporates and loses its life-giving spirit en route so that it is not suitable for génération. Surely, many more sperms would die, Albert notes, if they were transported a much longer distance from one body to another and then to yet a third prior to fertilization94. In light of such uncertainties, Albert détermines the question in this way: In reply to what was asked concerning génération, I do not know for sure what I ought to say, but it seems more probable that they [i.e., démons] are succubi to one and incubi to another. In fact, I understand most truly from one who is still living in our own day that when he was subject to the sin of masturbation, on a certain occasion an infinite number of cats appeared around him while he was polluted, and with the greatest yelling and noise they licked up his semen and carried it ofP5. From these brief words, which constitute his en tire solution, it is less than completely clear how Albert understands the demonic acquisi tion of the sperm with which they inseminate a human female. The succubus-incubus theory generally assumes, as its name indicates, that the démon assumes a body like that of a human female in order to receive the seed directly from an actual human male during sexual intercourse. And yet the example Albert provides is one in which démons assume the bodies of cats and lick up the semen spilled dur ing masturbation; presumably, each of these démons subsequently assumed a body like that of a human male by means of which the human sperm was deposited into a human female through intercourse. In discussing this fascinating passage, Maaike van der Lugt under stands these two possibilities — namely, that the demonic succubus receives the sperm directly and internally, on the one hand, or that the démon in some other corporeal form collects the sperm externally, on the other — as mutually exclusive théories, only one of which Albert chose. Based on no other text of Albert than the few lines 94. Albertus Magnus, Comm. in II, d. 8, a. 5, quaest., p. 97. 95. Albertus Magnus, Comm. in II, d. 8, a. 5, ad quaest., p. 98: «Ad aliud quod quaeritur de generatione, nescio secundum veritatem quid dicam: sed hoc videtur probabilius, quod succubi sint ad unum, et incubi ad alium: tarnen verissirae ab eo nuper qui adhuc vivit intellexi, quod dum mollitiei vitio subiaceret, quodam tempore infiniti cati circam eum pollutum apparuerunt maximo eiulatu et strepitu semen lingentes et déportantes».</page><page sequence="29">THE EMBODIMENT OF ANGELS 53 quoted above, van der Lugt maintains that Albert opted finally, though not without hésitation, for the basic succubus scénario96. It seems in light of his solution, however, that Albert understands the scénario of external sperm collection as also falling under the général succubus-incubus rubric, and that he is less concerned with the how of semen-acquisition than with affirming the larger theory of demonic génération. Albert's reply to the objection concerning evaporation of the semen, which reply immediately follows his solution, seems to provide support for our reading. Here he affirms that in order to prevent evaporation (presumably during the process of transfer) the démon places the collected semen adjacent to similar semen possess ing natural heat (undoubtedly semen collected internally or more recently) in order to keep it warm and preserve it until the time of its use97. This reply aims to explain the real technical possibility of the external collection of semen within the larger succubus-incubus theory. Furthermore, that Albert concludes his discussion of whether demons are able to generate and from where they take the semen for this pur pose with this reply suggests that this possibility of external collection from a polluted human was for him a compelling one. rvcg&lt;iiuicaa υι mucii 5 picicncu mcuiy υι j&gt;ciiieii-gaxiiermg uy démons, however, it is the more général succubus-incubus view of angelic génération (or, more properly, non-generation) that Thomas inherits from his master and seeks to explain philosophically. In De potentia question 6 article 8, Aquinas draws an important distinction which helps him to clarify why génération is not, properly speaking, an action performed by the angelic succubus-tumed-incubus: namely, that between the species and nature of an opération or action. Whereas an action, such as motion, takes its species from its term or end, it takes its nature or what is natural to it from its principle. Thus, «movements and actions which proceed from an intrinsic prin ciple are called natural»98. We have seen in the case of eating that a 96. Van der Lugt, Le ver, pp. 275-276. 97.

HARKINS particular movement performed by an angel may terminate in an effect that has a certain likeness to natural human eating (e.g., food is chewed and swallowed); but angelic eating cannot be said to be natural by virtue of the fact that it does not proceed from a principle intrinsic to the angel, nor does it terminate in a soul and in a body animated by a soul (as, e.g., true human digestion does)99. Similarly, although demonic sexual intercourse terminâtes in a human-like off spring, génération cannot be said to be natural to the démon. In fact, what is quite clear is that the offspring produced by the twofold sexual union of the démon with the male and female human, respec tively, is natural only to the human man and woman. In short, Thomas is here explicitly drawing out the philosophical implications for life-functioning of the basic médiéval understanding of angels as innately incorporeal créatures whose union to bodies is never hypo static, never natural, as îs the union between soul and body in a human. In light of Thomas's treatment, we might well ask why angels appear to have bodies like humans in which they appear to perform certain natural human opérations if in fact they neither have bodies nor naturally function in them in the same way that humans do. Do angels in assumed bodies deceive, whether intentionally or not, the humans with whom they interact? Is divine Scripture, in which we read about angels performing various functions of life, less than completely trustworthy? Aquinas anticipâtes these important ques tions in the first objection of article 3 of question 51 of the First Part, in which he notes that it is not fitting that «angels of truth» (angelos veritatis) should feign possessing living bodies and engaging in natu ral human behaviors. It is not contrary to the truth, Thomas explains in replying to the objection, that Scripture describes certain intelligi ble realities under sensible figures since this îs done not ror the pur pose of demonstrating that these intelligible realities are sensible, but rather so that the properties of intelligible things might be better understood according to likeness. «In this way it is not incompat ible with the truth of the holy angels», Aquinas argues, «that the bodies assumed by them seem to be living humans, although they are not. For they [i.e., the bodies] are assumed only so that the spiritual 99.

Although question 51 article 3 of the First Part provides no further explanation of how human properties and functions manifest the spiritual properties and opérations of angels, Thomas appears to offer an example to the careful reader of De potentia question 6 article 8: namely, the génération of offspring. The seventh objection points out that if angels in assumed bodies merely transferred human semen from a human male to a human female in order to facilitate natural human reproduction, the offspring said to be generated by démons would be proportionate to the power of the seed and thus would be no taller and stronger than those produced according to the normal mode or human reproduction. But uenesis t&gt;:4 cieany teacnes tnat «giants» (gigantes) were born when the sons of God had intercourse with the daughters of men101. In response to the objection, Thomas makes perfectly clear that because the ofifspring produced by a démon acting as succubus-tumed-incubus is generated by the power of the human seed, he is not the son of the démon but rather of the human male whose semen the démon transferred. He proceeds to explain, then, how giants can be produced: And nevertheless it is possible that stronger and bigger humans could be produced in such a way because démons, wishing to appear miraculous in their deeds, are able to actively contribute to this by observing the designated positions of the stars and the disposition of the man and woman, and par ticularly if the seeds that are used as instruments achieve a certain increase of power through such use102. 100. THOMAS Aquinas ST, I, q. 51, a. 3, ad 1, p. 260: «Ita non répugnât veritati sanctorum angelorum quod corpora ab eis assumpta videntur homines, licet non sint. Non enim assumuntur nisi ut per proprietates hominis et operum hominis spirituales proprietates angelorum et eorum spiritualia opéra designentur». Thomas further explains here that it would be less fitting if angels were to assume true humans since their proper ties would then lead us to humans rather than to angels. 101. THOMAS Aquinas, Depotentia, q. 6, a. 8, obj. 7, p. 211: «Praeterea, secundum hoc, ex tali semine homo non generaretur nisi secundum virtutem humani seminis.

HARKINS It is by such magical arts as astrology, according to Thomas, in com bination with the power of natural human semen that démons are able to facilitate the génération of giants. It is through this opération of procréation — an opération that remains ultimately a natural human action even in this extraordinary case — that the spiritual properties and opérations of the démons are demonstrated: that an offspring is generated is a naturally human opération, a function of the power of the human father and mother; that this offspring is a giant is a demonic opération, a conséquence of joining the power of the human seed with that of the magical arts. In identifying the mag ical arts as a coopérative source of demonic génération, Aquinas's teaching not only recalls the position of Alexander of Haies in his Gloss on distinction 8 of Book II of the Sentences but also represents a significant scholastic echo of 1 Enoch. 4. Conclusion We have aimed to survey how prominent masters of theology at Paris and Oxford in the middle of the thirteenth Century understood angelic bodies and the functions of life that angels can and cannot perform in these bodies. Our considération has highlighted the various ways that Alexander of Haies, Richard Fishacre, Richard Rufus, Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas, and Bonaventure employed Augustinian doctrine in combination with Aristotelian and Neo platonic thought to construct a metaphysics according to which aneels, inherentlv incorporeal and spiritual créatures, assume bodies not on account of any necessity on their part, but rather in order to successfully instruct humans concerning the divine will. It is, as Albert teaches, «on account of our material understanding» that angels take bodies to themselves and appear to perform various life-functions in them. Although Aristotle suggests that embodiment is wholly unneces sary and indeed inappropriate for a purely intellectual créature, Albert and his colleagues gleaned from Scripture that angels sometimes mulieris dispositionem, possunt ad hoc cooperari. Et praecipue si semina, quibus utuntur sicut instrumentis, per talem usum aliquod augmentum virtutis consequantur». On this passage, see also H. C. Lea, Materials Toward a History ofWitchcraft, ed.

They seem to eat, as in Genesis 18 and Tobit 12:19, and to engage in sexual intercourse and generate offspring, as in Genesis 6:1-4. But particu lar détails in these texts, read through the lens of certain traditional philosophical assumptions about angels, revealed to our mid-thir teenth-century schoolmen that angels do not truly eat, have sex, and reproduce in the way humans do. Rather, angels act in anthropo morphic ways, as Aquinas makes clear, in order to indicate their own spiritual properties and opérations through human attributes and actions. Our theologians took pains, then, to preserve the bright line of metaphysical distinction between angels and humans, while at the same time teaching that scriptural accounts of the embodied missions of angels often blur this line103. This dynamic gave rise in mid thirteenth-century thought, as we have seen, to what Tiziana Suarez Nani has aptly described as «un lien étroit et fécond entre la doctrine angélologique et l'anthropologie»104. The questions our theologians posed — whether angels and démons have bodies, what kind of bod ies they have, how and why their bodies are united to them, whether Lucy Cd.ll pciiuilll L/dolC lllC-1 UllCLlUllà III 111C11 UUU1C5 dliu nie answers they gave to these questions highlight their concern to eluci date and defend the basic metaphysical bifurcation between angels and human beings that they had inherited. All of our theologians agree that angels do not, in fact, have bodies in the way that we humans do, that is, bodies that are naturally or hypostatically united to them in such a way that they are moved by the rational soul. Rather, their bodies are extrinsic instruments that angels assume in order to carry out the ministerial work that God has commanded. Because these divine labors are performed for the sake of us humans, rational beings whose bodies and sensible faculties are constitutive of our beings, angels and démons must merely appear to engage in fonc tions of life that are altogether natural for us.
