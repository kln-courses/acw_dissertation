<plain_text><page sequence="1">George Greb ens chikov* EFREMOVS SCIENCE FICTION: A REEXAMINATION OF HIS MAJOR WORKS The popularity of Science Fiction (SF), or научная фантастика ,1 to use the Soviet term, in the Soviet Union can be traced back to the Revolution. 2 An exten- sion of the eighteenth century Russian legend and tale of adventure, travel, the Utopian, and American themes, the SF genre, as is well-known, developed with the ad- vent of scientific, technological and industrial devel- opments in Western civilization. The eighteenth century Enlightenment, Rationalism and optimism were incorporated into SF under the twentieth century myth, diagnosed by Jacques El lui as the belief that history develops in endless progress, that man's aim in life is happiness, that man is naturally good and that everything is matter. This myth was expressed in Science, Future, Work, Youth, Nation and Hero. The Soviet reader has had a steady supply of SF throughout the years. Aleksej Tolstoj, V. GonČarov, B. Obručev, and A. Beljaev, and later writers such as V. Nemcev, I. Efremov, G. Gor, M. Emeev, A. and B. Strugackie, Dneprov and others have been among the most popular. Al- though the taste for SF has been declining in the past two years, it is valuable to reexamine the Soviet preoccupation with the phantastic from the late 50s to the early 70s. The dominant Soviet SF figure during this period was Ivan Antonovic Efremov (1907-1972), a paleontologist and a prize-winning member of the Academy of Science, who at- tracted world interest in 1957 with the publication of his- SF novel Tumannost1 Andromedy (Andromeda) Л Since then, Efremov became the prime SF theoretician and writer in the Soviet Union. Andromeda , and Efremov' s subsequent SF nov- els Cor Serpentis 1959) and čas byka (1969-70) , launched the Efremov School of SF replacing the Beljaev school, Ef- remov' s alma mater, which was popular during the 1940s and 50s. *George Grebenschikov is an Assistant Professor of Russian, Department of Modern Languages, Texas A &amp; M Uni- versity, College Station, Texas. 105</page><page sequence="2">Efremov reintroduced the Wells Utopian models for writing his own Utopian novels, such as Andromeda ( A Mod- ern Utopia) and Cas Ъука ( Man Likes Gods ) - models which have been ignored in the Soviet Union since AãN. Tolstoj's Aelita in the 1920s. Efremov maintained his SF deanship in the Soviet Union through his writing and methodological philosophy, integrating the diverse features of the genre into a unified official structure, giving it direction, content and scope. The Andromeda signalled to the Soviet SF writer that SF themes and approaches were to be diverse. Efremov* s first literary period (1942-1954), marked by his nineteen Jules Verne type "science adventure" stories and novels with historical themes, reflected Efremov 's bio- graphical and professional experiences and theories. The second period (1955-1972) opened a cycle of SF technologi- cal utopias, an experimental novel on psychological and sociological themes, Lezvye břitvy (1964), and a historical novel Tais afinskajèa (1973). 6 The utopias depicted incom- plete future planetary and galactic Communist societies viewed at several levels of their development. Between 4000-4375 A.D., the open Universe becomes man's hope for happiness and fulfillment. Edifying a systematic philosophical and critical struc- ture on Engels's cosmocentric philosophy, Efremov combined the principles of the Utopian socialists (primarily the Neo-Saint Simonians Vladimir Vernadsky, Aleksandr Bogdanov^ and Pierre Teil hard de Chardin) with trends of American and European SF,^ striving to raise his SF to the level and dignity of a major literary genre. 8 Efremov rejected Western SF trends, such as the Space Opera, Fantasy and Sword and Sorcery, Heroic Fantasy and the New Wave, for their haphazard imagination: Из ять науку из фантастики значило бы возвратиться к фантазированию дорелигиоз- ного типа, к кострам палеонтологических пещер, где бывалые охотники рассказывали про крылатых драков и белых единорогов. Любопытно, что ' чистая* фантастика , пуб- ликуемая на Западе , мало чем отличается от подобных измышлений , герои ее летают на драконах , попадают в нереальные об- щества на какие-нибудь первобытные пла- неты , сами при этом обращаясь в дикарей . Нарушается логика , причинность , диалектика . у 106</page><page sequence="3">If scientific credibility was to be preserved in SF, it had to be done by avoiding topics which dealt with mystics, were-wolves, cosmic gangsters and frightening murders JO The essence of SF, Efremov wrote, was to show, through scientific achievements, how man changed his en- vironment and himself; while the task of SF was to note the ideas which dealt with man's inevitable dispersion through space, his presence on the frontiers of the known universe and his contact with alien civilization. These problems would encompass all aspects of realityJl Efremov' s futurologi cal methodology suggests the Futurmat method. To depict conditions in the future, one had to: 1) project a line, idea, or image; 2) choose the heralding material from the present; 3) develop the mate- rial according to the principles of DiamatJ? Efremov actualized the "will be", idealizing the Socialist Real- ism method and creating a future for which the material- ist fathers did not leave a blueprint. On the other hand, Efremov' s early novels reflected contemporary political issues from the Socialist Realist view. As with SF in the West, Efremov's SF reflected the Cold War conflicts: Andromeda forewarned, among other things, about the con- sequences of excessive experimentation with atomic power; Cor Serpentis depicted greed and selfishness as the source for communication breakdown between rational beings. Ef- remov replied to Murray Linster's story First Contact that communication between humans and extraterrestrials can be positive; čas byka speculated on the consequences and dan- gers of a polluted planet and an uncontrolled society, and that the inevitable end will prove to result in the defeat of the mindless by the mindful. In addition to the anti -capi tal ist themes, Efremov's novels reflected anti -Stal i ni st elements in Andromeda , and anti-Chinese in Čas byka. The catalyst for conflict in Efremov's Utopian novels is the image of the Bull, whose psychological diagnosis is found in Andromeda: Бык--это сильный и энергичный Л но совер- шенно безжалостный к чужим страданиям и переживаниям чело в ек3 думающий только об удовлетворении своих потребностей. Стра- дания3 раздоры и несчастия в далеком прош- лом человечества всегда усугублялись именно такими людьми 3 провоз г лашавшими себя в раз- 107</page><page sequence="4">ных обличиях единственно знающими ис- тину, считавшими себя вправе подовлять все несо гласные с ними мнения 9 искорен- ять иные образы мышления и жизнь. С тех пор человечество избегало малейшего признака абсолютности во мнениях , жела- ниях и вкусах и стало более всего опа- саться " быков ". The epigram to Ъаэ Ъука identified the Bull with the Demon, a dictator- type evident in other Soviet SF works, ^ who was conscious of the futility over which he ruled. The Danteian Inferno setting on the planet TormansJŠ which was visited by the Communist crew, was polluted, had crumbling cities, rising crime and irrational popula- tion control practices. Efremov dealt with questions of intervention, individual versus the collectivity, strug- gle for survival, planned society, relationship between good and evil, encounter with the strange and unusual and the role and function of technology in society. Efremov' s utopia structuring methodology is proces- sive. The utopia is moving into an open-ended future. They are grandiose, though isolated in time; yet they are connected to the present with a plausible history. The technological marvels include biological engineering, four world computer brains, bionics and advanced medicine and psychology-a subject developed in detail in the nov- el Lezvye brïtvy . The "proletariat-scientist" experiment- ed with time, worked and explored in space and reorganized societies on foreign planets. History is generalized and vague. Heroes spent their time comparing their societies, justifying the behavior of the citizens with those of an imperfect, war torn world of today, deciphering archeo- logical evidence and theory. In all technological Uto- pian novels, Efremov identified only four historical personalities: Heinsenberg, Einstein, Marx, and Vernad- ski j. Efremov' s theory of character creation was system- atically derived from his general cosmocentric philoso- phy. He disagreed with writers of SF who simply trans- port contemporary imperfect heroes into a perfect future society, as the Strugatskij brothers do. Likewise, Ef- remov rejected oversimplifications of the character's "psycho-social" complexity. He replaced Freudian notions of "human nature" by concepts of "human condition. 108</page><page sequence="5">The resultant characters, whether future man or extrater- restrial, were conditioned by particular environment and are anthropomorphic types. Efremov's character prototypes are structured upon the following coordinates: (1) Social laws--"The law of the Ariman Arrow" and "The Law of Unbenificial Coincidences"^ determine the hero's psychology and motives: the I is always in accord with the We. (2) Efremov's concept of the "expediency of art" emphasized the hero's racial characteristics. "Godvana" type unit- ed man with nature onvthe instinct, complexes, feeling and sensation level (Cara Nandi), while the "Tetis" type, a prototype taken from the myths of ancient Greece, Crete, America and Polynesia, united man with nature on the emotional level. A composite of Russian, Scandinavian and English type makes up the third proto- type. The woman, in this case, had золотые волосы или светлоруссые 3 спо- койный и прозрачный взгляд 3 высокий и чуть медлительный 3 пристально вгляды- вающийся на мир взгляд . 4 8 (3) The professional, motivational and temperamental as- pects of the character was expressed through the ge- netico-psycholog-ical ancestry. In Andromeda , Efremov designed two basic types: the Neoandratholoid, who was strong, massive, and rough and the Cromanoloid, who was thinner, taller, delicate in psychology and sensitive in feelings. Erg Noor, of Scandinavian Viking ancestry, was a starship commander, while Dar Veter, a Russian, coordinated satellites and space stations around the earth. Characters in byka have been biologically engineered into universal genetico-psycho- logical characters. (4) Efremov distinguished between active and contemplative types. The first transformed the world of things, the latter the world of ideas. Niza Krit and Erg Noor (northern Scandinavian types) preferred cold seas and deep universe for exploration. Dar Veter and Veda Kong (northern Russian) preferred warmer seas, Earth and closer Space. The first couple have practical reason- ing, the latter contemplative. The love triangle, for 109</page><page sequence="6">example, exemplified the temperamental differences between them. In Cas Ъука9 however, mankind reached a much more universal level of development in all areas of the human condition: Фай Родис отражала еще одну ступень повышения энергии и универсальности человека s сознательно вырабатываемой в обществе s избегающей гибельной специализации. Фай Родис во всем ка- залась плотнее 3 тверже женщин ЭВК-- и очертания сильного тела с крепким скелетом 3 и посадкой головы на высо- койу но не тонкой шее &gt; и неприклонным вз глядом глаз ¿ расставленных шире s чем у Веды ¿ и соответственно большей шириной лба и подбородка . Помимо этих внешних архаичных черт большей психофизической силы и кре- пости тела3 Родис и внутренне отли- чалась от Веды любой потянулся бы безоговорочно и доверчиво , то Родис была бы о граждена чертой s для пре- одаления3 которой требовалось уверен- ность и усилие. Если Веда вызывала любовь с первого взгляда л то Родис - приклонение и некоторую опаску. ^ Fa j Rodi s possessed the characteristics of the active and contemplative character. She is a commander, a historian, an esthet, psychologist, hypnotist, and dancer. If in Andromeda the Neoandratholoid and Cro- manoloid prototypes remind one of Wells's Morloks and El ois, Faj Rodi ś is a blend of both. (5) The romantic approach is furthered by Efremov's trans- position of character traits of people he had known to his SF novel characters. Efremov's methodology was basically anthropological --he identified human species and their behavior within an unknown exotic environ- ment. He meticulously defined, explained and justi- fied the rational of their behavior. He admitted that such characters might become incomprehensible to the average contemporary reader, echoing Strugackij broth- ers' and Sinjavskij's observation that under perfect conditions there can be conflict only between the good 110</page><page sequence="7">and the better. 20 Nevertheless, Efremov devised conflict in four ways: 1) emerging pre-utopian genetic and psy- chological imperfections caused conflict in feelings, 2) impulsiveness, or motivational changes, are consequent to logic-emotional conflicts,21 3) the protagonist clashes with an imperfect hostile environment (as compared with A.N. Toi stoj' s Aelita) and 4) age, maturity, experience differences caused temporary conflicts. To conclude, through his SF, Efremov formalized a natural and social philosophy, and, through this, system- atized scientific and technological knowledge for the So- viet reader and writer. Efremov wrote that he wanted "to reveal through literature the poetry of understanding the world which is implicit in science, but which remained hid- den at any rate for the non-scientist. 1,22 To achieve this, Efremov developed several areas for the genre. First, he developed a SF vocabulary, terms which would render a great- er reader awareness of the complex world and its future. But the overextended use of this "scientific license" over- loaded the story with fantastic terms. Andromeda' s glos- sary, for example, contains 59 words of which 27 are fan- tastic: rapagular calculus, bipolar mathematics, chochlear calculus, and singular points are but a few examples. Secondly, if Efremov' s literary merits, for the most part, did not exceed those of the Soviet industrial novels of the 1930s and 40s, Efremov did widen the scope of topics and themes in Soviet SF. He introduced the social utopia, re- lativity and experiment with time and created other proto- type characters. He did not, however, totally emerge from the restrictions Soviet SF had imposed upon itself in the 30s: mutants, cybernauts, androids, and travel through time or to truly "other" worlds were all taboo. Contempo- rary Soviet SF had gone far beyond in the prognostication and use of technology (cybernetics). Ol'ga Larenova spec- ulated about robots endowed with near human personalities ( Leopard s versiny Kilamandzaro , Рока ty rabotala) . Voj- sunskij and Luxjdjanov discussed about the nature of mind- matter- technology relationships in I uviděl ostal'noe. Stanislav Lem, the Polish SF writer, speculated on the mind-matter paradoxes, on "other" superior god-like minds and on the nature of matter ( Pravda 3 Solaris ), while the Strugackij brothers described the unusual and the subcon- scious in Ulitka na sklone. For the most part, the above themes came from the West (Arthur C. Clarke, Pol Anderson, A.F. Hoyle, Van Gogt). Soviet works now emerge in the Samizdat (Strugackij Gadkie lebedi , Skazka o trojkę). Ill</page><page sequence="8">The third area in which Efremov contributed to SF was in upgrading the role of the woman in the SF novel. Until recently, women's role in SF, both in the West and East has generally been displaced by descriptions of "other" worlds, life forms, robots and computers. Efremov, because of his interest in the Indian philosophy, its devotion to the feminine principle and concept of nature^3, endowed the women with traits best portraying the concepts of Communism, sometimes overreaching himself to almost identify future Communism with "matriarchy." For example, the principle representatives of Communism in Cas Ъука were women, while on the anti -utopi an planet Tormans, they were males. The heroes' professions identified men with the "present": they were administrators, technicians and scientists, while the women, with the natural "past" and "future", were his- torians, sociologists, and psychologists. Women were not only esthetical ly, hypnotically and emotionally more at- tractive, but they also carried the socio-historical sub- stantiated dialogues and monologues. The women were ideals for the young while the pre-utopian male leaders were rooted in the present, suppressing the past and lacking foresight, cutting youth in its prime. Some of Efremov 's theoretical weaknesses should not, however, be seen as a lack of influence. Efremov influ- enced the young and most of the contemporary SF writers. Ol'qa Larenova and Valentina Žuravleva" were among his faithful followers. New trends in SF and phantastic lit- erature in general developed almost simultaneously with the appearance of Andromeda . NOTES 1. The concept научная фантастика ( НФ ) "science phantasy" on the surface agrees on the term "science" although the Soviet definition is philosophical (Diamat) rather than the purely empirical definition. The difference arises in regard to the second term. In Russian, "fantastika" stresses the phantastic as- pect of the literature; that is to say, the possibi- lity or even the plausibility of this phantasy to be- come reality sometime in the future. ( Eneiklopedi - oeskij slovar'j Moscow, 1960, III, 789.) H.W. Fowler distinguishes between the English words fantasy and phantasy. The former denotes caprice, whim, fanciful 112</page><page sequence="9">invention; the latter--an imaginative, visionary notion. {Modern English Usage , [New York: Oxford U.R., Inc. 1957], p. 169). The latter term emphasizes the Russian meaning of "fantastika." 2. Phantastic elements of Jules Verne and Edgar Wells were evident in the literature of the Smithy movement in the Soviet Union, the satirical works of Majakov- skij and works of Zamiatin and Bulgakov. 3.

One can speculate whether Efremov had another meaning for Tormans, other than "terminus", Efremov satirized Terminus in Asimov's Foundation trilogy. 16. Efremov writes: ["The Freudists and Behaviorists] ac- cepted the dynamics of the psychological process as being static, considering such particular essences as the 'libido' or the 'mentality' as constants. Actually, there exist only impulsive flashes, which can be easily coordinated by training and exercises. . .Supporting it- self on a philosophical purport." ( Cas byka , p. 251). 17. The "Law of the Ariman Arrow" is defined as "the ten- dency of a badly organized society with a morally heavy noosühere to multiply evil and sorrow."
