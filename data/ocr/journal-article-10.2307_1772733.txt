<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Difference of Literature Robert Alter Comparative Literature, UC-Berkeley Are the kinds of attention we bring to bear on literature, the skills we use to read it, different from those we exercise in reading other sorts of texts? A generation ago, most critical circles in Europe and America would have answered the question unhesitatingly with a fervent yes. Behind that affirmation stood a long tradition of ideas about literature as a unique repository of values and a uniquely rich vehicle of expres- sion that went back at least to the early nineteenth century or, perhaps further still, to Renaissance apologies for literature like Sir Philip Sid- ney's Defense of Poetry. Over the past two decades, however, all such "privileging" of literature over other kinds of discourse has come to seem radically suspect. We read literature, the new critics have argued on various grounds, with the same set of complex skills we use to read newspapers, legal rulings, menus, advertisements, sex manuals; and it is only cultural prejudice or ideological conviction that allows us to claim a special truth for literature. For the moment, I would like to concentrate on the issue of how literature is read, leaving the question of truth for separate consideration. It is obvious that there are usually strong continuities between the ways we read literary texts and the ways we read other kinds of texts. If this were not so, we would all need elaborate specialized training, like taking courses in Sanskrit or calculus, in order to make sense of the simplest story or poem. In fact, this sort of sharp split between lit- erary and ordinary language does occasionally occur in the evolution of literary history. Thus, the poetry of medieval Spain in both Ara- Poetics Today 9:3 (1988).

In our own century, certain radical literary experiments, like Joyce's in Finnegans Wake or those of the French New Novelists of the 50s and 60s, have so strenuously deformed or reformed the shape of words and sentences, the sequence of verbs and units of syntax, the conventional patterns of narrative continuity, that they have to some degree created their own special languages and may well require some specialized training to read. These exceptions to the general rule suggest that there could be an inherent momentum in the literary use of language that swerves away from the norms of ordinary language, but the manifold connections between the two can scarcely be ignored. When we read a novel or poem, our eyes scan the printed page, left to right, up to down, and our minds identify grammatical forms, syntactical patterns, word-choices (often with a subliminal awareness of choices rejected by the writer) with the same cultural reflexes-the same competence, as linguists say-that we use to decipher non-literary texts. The shared ground of expression is what enables us to put down an issue of Newsweek or The National Geo- graphic and begin a story by Eudora Welty or a novel by John LeCarre without undergoing some sort of mental disorientation. But the new wave of literary theory has led many to insist not merely on this obvious continuity but on a leveling of literature with other kinds of discourse, and it is worth looking closely at what goes on in literary texts to see whether such leveling is analytically defensible. The denial of the distinctiveness of literature has been made from two general standpoints, one linguistic and the other ideological. Since it may be easier to proceed from large overviews to the close inspection of textual details, let me begin with the ideological argument. Literature, it has often been claimed over the past quarter-century, is neither a stable nor a coherent entity. One way you can tell this is by the shifting nature of the literary canon. As cultural fashions change and new values come to the fore, writers once deemed periph- eral or uncanonical are brought into the canon, others once thought central being displaced to the margins. More drastically, books that were not originally imagined to belong to the category of literature, like Augustine's Confessions, Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy, Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams are read into the canon and discussed in the same breath-or in the same course-with novels and poems. The pronounced tendency of our own time has been toward a new in- clusiveness, a taking into the canon of philosophers and theorists of culture, previously neglected women writers, unrecognized minority</page><page sequence="3">Alter ? The Difference of Literature 575 writers, practitioners of folk poetry and other forms of expression once held to be sub-literary. This movement of inclusion in itself sug- gests to many that there may be something arbitrary and, indeed, slanted, about the canon. Literature, then, according to this line of reasoning, is not a fixed entity but a reflection in any society of the values of the ruling class, abetted by a learned or priestly elite. The poems, plays, stories, and discursive texts of a culture may variously delight or stir its members, but they are admitted to the canon chiefly because of their consonance with the distribution of power in the so- ciety, their effectiveness in reassuring or training or lulling people so that they will better perform their given social roles. Literature, in this view, is ultimately an arm of politics and as such it can be anything that politics decrees; its status as a specially valued kind of writing -"privileged," presumably, like the privileged classes with their un- deserved wealth-is conferred by the values that regulate the flow of power in a society. This position has been stated with uncompro- mising clarity by the British neo-Marxist, Terry Eagleton, who has no difficulty imagining a future society in which Shakespeare would no longer make sense as literature, "would be no more valuable than much present-day grafitti" (1983: 11). "Damn braces, bless relaxes," William Blake once observed and it is surely bracing to be reminded that the canon of Western literature was not given for all time from Sinai or Olympus, that its contours have often reflected ideological pressures. On the other hand, the re- duction of literature purely to considerations of ideology overlooks a good deal of the historical evidence. For all the changes through the ages in values and the changes in political arrangements behind them, the literary tradition exhibits a surprising degree of stability. It might be imagined as a large and variegated corpus with a relatively sta- ble center and intermittently shifting borders. We have gone through a dizzying variety of societies over the past two millennia but none has seriously questioned the status as literature of Homer, Sophocles, Sappho, Virgil, Horace. The significance of the major writers is of course constantly redefined as values shift but not their connection to literature. Shakespeare has been presented in every conceivable mode from neoclassical stateliness to raucous punk but, even on the basis of a mere four centuries, one would have to say that a society in which Shakespeare's plays were no more than grafitti would have to be a science-fiction construct in which people moved on conveyor belts in- stead of legs and sorted out reality with microchip implants instead of brains. One reason for the cohesiveness of literary tradition over a stretch of almost three thousand years is its powerful impulse of self-recapitu- lation. Writers repeatedly work under the influence of a founding</page><page sequence="4">576 Poetics Today 9:3 model, whether happily or not; they repeatedly return to origins, seek- ing to emulate, extend, transpose or outdo some founder (but not merely to outdo-hence the limitation of the idea of Oedipal rebellion as the chief mechanism of literary production). Unless we keep this principle in mind, it will seem bizarre that a seventeenth-century Pu- ritan poet like Milton and an eighteenth-century Catholic-born Deist poet like Pope should devote such energy to the emulation of pagan Homer and Virgil as the great models for their enterprise. On a briefer time-scale, it would otherwise be strange that Stendhal and Flaubert, as worldly novelists of post-Napoleonic France, should revert to the model of Cervantes, a writer who flourished two and a half centuries earlier in the aftermath of feudalism that was monarchic Spain. There is a backward-looking aspect of literature that cuts across political systems; writers, whatever their tacit and explicit ideological commitments, are often extraordinarily preoccupied with literature as an internally coherent, self-propelling set of models and norms. Cromwell was a powerful consideration for Milton but in the end far less compelling than Virgil and the author or authors of Genesis. Again, there is more involved here than the relation, rebellious or oth- erwise, of literary son to father. The founding instance of every genre, sub-genre, or cogent literary mode at once establishes a vocabulary others can abundantly use and constitutes an achievement they may well envy. The achievement elicits competition or perhaps rebellion but the vocabulary encourages receptivity, the shared use of valuable common property. The peculiar orientation of literature toward such models needs to be understood as one of the conditions for the dis- tinctiveness of the language of literature. Aeschylus and Sophocles invent tragedy; virtually everything that follows in the genre at least indirectly exploits the resources they made available and is gauged by the benchmark they set-at any rate, until Shakespeare, who, blowing the life of genius into an Elizabethan hybrid dramatic form, creates a new model, a new benchmark. To think of any piece of writing as literature, it has been argued, is to attribute special value to it without in the end being able to specify the nature of the class of textual objects to which it has been attached. The assignment of status, then, has to be a reflection of cultural or political values not intrinsic to the writing. It would be foolish not to recognize that literary works are often esteemed at least partly be- cause they express values deemed important by the culture at large: the courtly romance and feudal society are a particularly clear in- stance of the general principle. But the force of this whole argument will be considerably weakened if we can identify intrinsically literary values, and I believe that to be the case. If any purposeful order- ing of language implies some intention of communication, literature</page><page sequence="5">Alter * The Difference of Literature 577 is remarkable for its densely layered communication, its capacity to open up multifarious connections and multiple interpretations to the recipient of the communication and for the pleasure it produces in making the instrument of communication a satisfying aesthetic object -or more precisely, the pleasure it gives us as we experience the nice interplay between the verbal aesthetic form and the complex meanings conveyed. It is on these grounds that it is valued as literature. To call King Lear literature and categorically to deny that classification to the most cleverly spray-painted inscription on a wall is to recognize that two drastically different orders of communication are going on in the two "texts" in question, that of Lear being not only infinitely richer, in- finitely more complicated and more pleasurable but also recognizably allied with the order of communication that takes place in a very large and variegated body of texts we confidently identify as literature. It may not be altogether fair to compare the literary act of communi- cation to that of grafitti or laundry lists or telephone directories, since there are, after all, works of philosophy, history, psychological theory, and social analysis that exhibit the most formidable complexities. I do not mean to claim that literature is more precise or more profound than these other kinds of discourse, only that it is different in the way it plays with multiple meanings and in the centrality of aesthetic plea- sure to the act of communication. (And there are, of course, intriguing borderline cases in which the ostensibly non-literary text achieves lit- erary force or uses literary techniques, as in Gibbon's history, Plato's philosophy, Freud's psychological theory; but fuzzy borders do not imply that a phenomenon lacks distinctive character.) Spinoza's Ethics might arguably offer more probing perceptions of human nature than Tom Jones or War and Peace but, even with the essayistic elements in both those novels, the how and what of communication in them are very different from Spinoza's, and the range of aesthetic delights they offer is far removed from any chaste (and purely secondary) pleasure a reader may experience in the logical form of the Ethics. In Chapter 24 of Genesis, Abraham sends his servant from Canaan to the family home in Mesopotamia to find a bride for Isaac, and the servant encounters at the well exactly the girl he is looking for, the lovely, nubile, and generous Rebecca. He loads her with precious or- naments and she hastens home to bring her family the news of the stranger's arrival. At this point, her brother Laban, who will play an important role later in the story of Jacob, is introduced in the fol- lowing terms: "And it came to pass, when he saw the nose-ring, and the bracelets upon his sister's arms, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me, that he came unto the man; and behold, he stood by the camels at the well. And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; wherefore standest thou</page><page sequence="6">578 Poetics Today 9:3 without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels" (Gen. 24: 30-31).1 The remarkable speed of characterization here is in part dictated by the extraordinary economy of means employed by biblical narrative but the kind of communication that takes place is also characteristically literary. All we know about Laban when he appears on the scene is his name (it means "white one," which later will become thematically significant), his family relationship and, most strikingly, his eye for the glitteringjewels with which his sister appears suddenly bedecked. The eyeing of the jewels is tucked into an intro- ductory subordinate clause and what it means as a narrative datum is left in delicate suspension. Perhaps, because the seeing is coupled syntactically with the hearing of Rebekah's report, it merely indicates a recognition that the stranger has good connections and honorable intentions and therefore may be welcomed into the household. But the strategic reticence with which the information is conveyed opens the strong suspicion that Laban's Oriental professions of hospitality are mere hypocrisy and triggered by the profit motive. The suspicion will be confirmed a quarter of a century later in narrated time through Laban's struggles with Jacob over property and compensation; for the moment, we are invited to set his somewhat ambiguous reception of a guest against quite different hospitality scenes represented earlier in the narrative. What I would stress about the literary character of the communication is not only the avoidance of semantic closure, the en- couraging of a balancing act between different possible construals, but also what might be called the high fun of the act of communication. As receivers of this potentially ambiguous message, we are meant, I think, to take pleasure in the very economy with which it is conveyed (in other kinds of texts, profusion rather than economy might be the source of pleasure), in the syntactic subordination of the information, which has the teasing effect of disguising it but disguising it transpar- ently. In this way we are invited to join actively in a game for which the rules are indicated by the text, imaginatively beginning to build a picture of Laban's character that will have to be augmented and re- vised if and when we are given more narrative data about him. This open-ended process of pleasurable discovery is literary reading par excellence. The deep and abiding attractions of this literary experience both for writers and their audiences help explain a curious aspect of liter- ary history-that the literary canon, for all its supposed attachment to ideological values, often incorporates texts that run counter to the dominant ideology of the culture. The novel, for example, is clearly 1. The translation is the King James Version but I have silently emended several small inaccuracies.</page><page sequence="7">Alter * The Difference of Literature 579 associated through its subject matter, its language, the economic con- ditions in which it flourishes, with the rise to power of the middle classes and the large movement of urbanization that goes hand in hand with the Industrial Revolution. Thus an older generation of Marxist criticism was encouraged to think of the novel as "the epic of bour- geois life." But if among the principal bourgeois values are acquisitive- ness, belief in material progress, disciplined social behavior, sobriety, dedication to family, patriotism and boosterism, one must conclude that some of the most central figures in the canon of the nineteenth- century novel-Stendhal, Flaubert, Dostoevski, Melville, even Balzac -radically subvert these values or vehemently spurn them in their fiction. The Bible, as the model from which the concept of canon was drawn for application to secular literature, is an especially instructive case in point. Recently, some critics have taken pains to remind us what everyone has always known, that the Hebrew Bible in particular is a pre-eminently patriarchal document. There are hardly grounds for debate on the subject but one wonders why the male makers of this patriarchal canon included the story of Tamar and Judah (Gen. 38), Ruth, Esther, the portrait of female shrewdness and male malleabil- ity in Rebekah and Jacob, the satire of muscle-bound, concupiscent male gullibility in the Samson story. Still more drastically, how did Job, with its radical rejection of an anthropocentric creation and of retributive justice, Ecclesiastes, with its sense of futile, meaningless cy- cles, the Song of Songs, with its exuberantly playful eroticism, get into the Bible? What happens here, in one of the two ancient matrices of Western literature, is what happens again, repeatedly and character- istically, in the evolution of literary tradition: the literary imagination develops a momentum of its own, in indifference or in actual con- travention to reigning ideology; the pleasures of collaborative play we glimpsed in Laban's eyeing of the jewels are exercised far more complexly in the revelatory power of Job's poetry, in the haunting cadences of Ecclesiastes, in the delightfully suggestive imagery of the Song of Songs, and, through this collaborative play, a silent compact is created between writer and reader, against certain dominant trends of the culture. But since any statement made with words involves some degree of collaboration between the person who puts the words together and the one who interprets them, we still need to understand more pre- cisely how the collaborative play of literature may differ.2 In fact, a 2. Wolfgang Iser (1978), provides a valuable theoretical model for the interaction between literary text and reader. I am in sympathy with his aims, though I have some reservations about both his terminology and his conceptual framework, and will use neither in what follows.</page><page sequence="8">580 Poetics Today 9:3 good many linguistic critics, as I intimated earlier, have contended that there is no real difference. The linguistic argument against dif- ference runs as follows: Every verbal communication involves selecting from the shared system of language certain elements, certain struc- tures, that impose a particular perspective as the message is conveyed. If an American politician chooses to refer to the Soviet Union as a "rival" and not, let us say, as an "adversary" or actually an "enemy," he necessarily communicates to his audience by that choice certain as- sumptions about the nature of the Soviet Union and its foreign policy and the relations between the superpowers. The devices of expressive manipulation of language that we may associate with literature-like strategic selection of vocabulary, shifts in levels of diction, juggling of syntax, repetition, metaphorical substitution-abound everywhere that language is used. At best, it could be said that these are deployed more spectacularly in certain kinds of literary texts. Thus, the British linguist Roger Fowler quotes a famous couplet from The Rape of the Lock which describes the extreme dismay of the fair Belinda when her lock of hair is cut off by the Baron: Not louder Shrieks to pitying Heav'n are cast, When Husbands or when Lap-dogs breathe their last. (III: 157-158) He notes with approval, as most readers would, the striking compres- sion with which Pope succeeds in conveying a deformation of values in the society he represents by the bracketing of Husbands and Lap-dogs. Then he goes on to examine the treatment of an action of a national student organization in the headlines of three different British news- papers and concludes that the same process of encoding (a magic word for linguistic critics) operates in them as in the lines from Pope. "The constructive mode of the newspaper headlines is not essentially differ- ent from the 'creativity' of the extract from Pope.... Perhaps we load too great a responsibility upon literature by demanding it should be 'creative' if what is encoded in 'creative' is no more than an ordinary capacity of language" (1986: 26). It is surely possible to talk about the distinctive language of literature without invoking, as Fowler seems to think inevitable, an effusive cant term like "creative." More seriously, it is a glaring flaw in reasoning to conclude from the evident continu- ity between literature and other uses of language that they must be "not essentially different," that what happens in a great poem "is no more than an ordinary capacity of language" such as one might find exercised in the most hackneyed headline. In order to see why this claim ignores much of the relevant evidence, let us look more closely at the couplet from The Rape of the Lock. The syntactic bracketing of Husbands and Lap-dogs achieves its</page><page sequence="9">Alter * The Difference of Literature 581 special satiric force partly because it occurs within the tight symmetri- cal box of the heroic-couplet form, ten syllables to the line, every tenth syllable a rhyme. This form has the effect of sharplyfocusing individual terms, especially when they are metrically equivalent and syntactically parallel. Literary language in general may be usefully thought of as an intricate set of intermeshed focusing devices that give certain chosen terms, phrases, images, and ideas a density of meaning and a range of implication they would not have in ordinary language. To be fair to Roger Fowler, in a later chapter he recognizes the effect of poetic form and poetic context, speaking, somewhat awkwardly, of a "stylistic code [that] is an extra over and above the regular code of the language" -"a stylistic code which is built up in the poem as a whole, Pope's verse as a whole, Pope's predecessors in the heroic couplet verse form" (Ibid.: 50). This sensible remark actually quite subverts the previous claim that Pope and the headlines come down to the same exercise of an ordinary capacity of language, for what ordinary language lacks is these concentric sets of elaborately formalized contexts-specific po- etic form and genre, the intricate patterning of the work in question, the poet's own body of writings, his predecessors and the background of literary allusions invoked-which produce the complex meanings of the literary text. A newspaper can, of course, allude to Shakespeare or T. S. Eliot, and it will necessarily refer to certain journalistic conven- tions, but these analogies to the process of literary communication are intermittent, attenuated, reflect a much thinner order of textual orga- nization and participate in a kind of communication that has different aims. The couplet after the one already quoted from The Rape of the Lock extends the evocation of domestic disasters that elicit anguished fe- male response: Or when rich China vessels, fal'n from high, In glittering Dust and painted Fragments lie! (III: 159-60) Now we have a sequence of treasured things lost: the lock of hair (which has itself been interinvolved through metaphor and double entendre with Belinda's honor, her virginity, her narcissistic sense of self), Husbands, Lap-dogs, China. There is more expressed here than the simple distortion of values of the society in which Belinda moves. The couplet about the broken china, like much of the poem, is mock-epic but does not just mock. The eighteenth-century conven- tion of capitalizing significant nouns, together with the more general meanings of "vessels," allows Pope playfully to insinuate into an im- age of broken cups and vases the suggestion of fallen empires-"when rich China vessels, fal'n from high." The exquisite visualization of the</page><page sequence="10">582 Poetics Today 9:3 broken pieces in the next line, the "glittering Dust and painted Frag- ments," is a kind of citation (rather than burlesque) of the epic poetry of once great things in ruins and, with all the sweep of satiric verve, it has an odd plangency: the assignment of value in this mannered society may be arbitrary and even absurd, but, once value is conferred upon a fragile object, its irrevocable loss is a source of real pain; in a kind of optical illusion, the yawning gap between empires and vases flickers closed, then quickly opens again. The couplet, or rather the sequence of couplets, is a pre-eminent instance of the high fun of literary reading which does not allow us to settle on stable ground that offers a single unambiguous perspective, like the political slant of newspaper headlines. As with most literary texts, there are formal patterns within patterns that complicate our perception of the local statement. The yoking together of two disparate terms in a single syntactical structure, Hus- bands and Lap-dogs, is a traditional rhetorical device called zeugma, as Pope with his classical training was surely aware, and zeugma is used so abundantly in The Rape of the Lock that it becomes a defining rhetorical correlative of the society's wobbly vision of reality. Zeugma confronts two terms symmetrically; in the poem, it is repeatedly asso- ciated with another formal device, the catalogue, which by giving us a whole series of items invites us to contemplate in a different way the skewing of moral hierarchies that is one of the chief concerns of the poem. Thus, one couplet from the splendid catalogue of the contents of Belinda's dressing-table: Here Files of Pins extend their shining Rows, Puffs, Powders, Patches, Bibles, Billet-doux. (I: 137-138) The artful patterning of sound within the limits of the iambic line wonderfully reinforces the satiric force of the catalogue. The cosmetic implements form one phonetic cluster strongly marked by the triple alliteration of p's (again, conveniently capitalized, and so made visu- ally prominent, by eighteenth-century typographic convention). The series then switches to a pair of alliterated b's, "Bibles, Billet-doux," which thus constitute a zeugma within the catalogue; and "Bibles" works nicely both ways: following "Puffs, Powders, Patches," it is Holy Scripture reduced to an appurtenance of beauty (a dainty little vol- ume Belinda will carry along with her after patching and powdering); bracketed with "Billet-doux," it is an instance of writing scarcely dif- ferent for Belinda from the lovers' notes she keeps in piles. And the satiric interaction among the five nouns that make up the line, if rein- forced by alliteration, is doubly reinforced by stress, the line beginning not with an iamb but a spondee (two stresses in a row), so that we read</page><page sequence="11">Alter * The Difference of Literature 583 through the line stressing the initial accented syllable of each noun instead of following the iambic metrical units. Everyday language, of course, can also make use of expressive rhythm, alliteration, and cata- logues containing disparate items but the point is that the formal grid of the couplet makes possible an extraordinary degree of concentra- tion in the expressive effect of these devices that would scarcely be feasible elsewhere. The semantic range, moreover, that Pope establishes for the cata- logue as a central organizing device in The Rape of the Lock is greater than this brief instance suggests. Here is a sequence of eight lines at the beginning of Canto IV, just a little after the loss of the lock that was our point of departure: Not youthful Kings in Battel seiz'd alive, Not scornful Virgins who their Charms survive, Not ardent Lovers robb'd of all their Bliss, Not ancient Ladies when refus'd a Kiss, Not Tyrants fierce that unrepenting die, Not Cynthia when her Manteau's pinn'd awry, E'er felt such Rage, Resentment, and Despair, As Thou, sad Virgin! for thy ravish'd Hair. (IV: 3-10) Any abstract summary of the effect of such a catalogue, like deforma- tion of values or skewing of moral hierarchies, drains it of its almost dizzying richness. An obvious satiric point is driven home in the last item of the catalogue, Cynthia's rage and despair over her badly fas- tened cloak, but after what has preceded in the list, that detail has the sort of painful power that we experience in Proust in the Duchess de Guermantes's concern over her red shoes when her old friend Swann is dying. The catalogue begins with a properly epic item, the fate of young kings fallen in captivity, and that is complemented by the penul- timate item, the death of unrepentant tyrants. Within this epic or political frame, the scornful virgins and their later embodiment, the ancient ladies, are of course a target of social satire, but the barbed wit is accompanied by a kind of doubletake of compassion, or at any rate, enough space is opened up in the rapid-fire sequence of vignettes so that we can ponder the possibility of real tragedy in a virgin outliving her charms, an old woman deemed unkissable by society's cruel law of erotic egotism. (The cliche rhyme of"bliss" and "kiss" strengthens this reading, for bliss, in the elegant coded language of the eighteenth cen- tury, especially when it is the object of an "ardent lover," means sexual consummation and so its introduction here "physically" underscores the ancient ladies' plight of neglect in the next line.) Reading such passages, one may relish the wit of individual lines, but, more funda- mentally, the mind is teased into a dance of possibilities, society itself</page><page sequence="12">584 Poetics Today 9:3 being glimpsed in a kaleidoscopic vision where values are confused, men and women deluded and frustrated, and the surface comedy of social pretence and selfishness opers into an abyss of fates too sad for words. Literary texts, as the instance of The Rape of the Lock vividly shows, invite a special mode of attentiveness. The strength of this invita- tion may be most evident in the way we are led to perceive how the many components of the individual work interact with one another -recurrent rhetorical devices, like zeugma and catalogues, recurrent or related images, thematic key-words, parallel scenes and narrative situations. Now, it is conspicuously true of non-literary texts as well that, if they are to be more than jumbles of words and phrases, they necessarily marshall all kinds of techniques to establish internal links, create transitions, and produce meaningful movement from sentence to sentence and segment to segment. But this general quality of cohe- sion, as some linguists call it, is heightened to such a degree in literary texts that it becomes a difference in kind. Let me propose as a measure of this difference the recurrence in many literary texts of thematically marked single words. In non- literary texts, though there always exists the possibility of backward reference to previously used terms, virtually any term is in principle expendable, may be replaced by a synonym or a paraphrase or the merest pronoun because non-literary language is oriented, as Roman Jakobson would say, toward the message. By contrast, in literature, because we are made so conscious of the verbal medium, any themat- ically marked term is in principle reusable and often becomes part of an internal feedback system in which as we read we will observe it appearing in new contexts, generating new meanings that double back on the earlier ones. The literary text may indeed be thought of as a formally structured catalyst of memory, even when, in an amnesiac age like our own in which few retain poetry by heart any more, the memory operates subliminally. The poetic argument of the Book of Job begins in Chapter 3 with an awesome death-wish poem that features wombs closing, darkness blotting out light. When, thirty-five chapters later, God answers Job out of the whirlwind by evoking the vital power of creation, the terms womb, darkness, light, and even a peculiar verb, "hedge in, " all recur but with the meaning of the cluster of words turned all the way around from death to life. In The Rape of the Lock, some 140 lines after the striking zeugma of Husbands and Lap-dogs, which is likely to have been deeply impressed in the imagination of most attentive readers, Belinda's friend Thalestris concludes a solemn oath expressing her outrage over Belinda's fall from grace in the following couplet:</page><page sequence="13">Alter * The Difference of Literature 585 Sooner let Earth, Air, Sea to Chaos fall, Men, Monkeys, Lap-dogs, Parrots, perish all! (IV: 119-120) The lines are a brief anticipation of the comic apocalyptic mode that Pope would cultivate much later in his career in The Dunciad. As such, they suggest how the device of the catalogue could be moved from an expression of disjointed moral hierarchies to an intimation of all sustaining order going to pieces. In the initial instance, Lap-dogs were symmetrically yoked with Husbands to make a clearcut, devastating satiric point. (Still earlier, at 1:115, Belinda was awakened by her lap- dog.) Here the Husbands have been replaced by the generic term Men -ambiguously, the context prevents us from deciding with assurance whether the reference is to male humans or to all humanity-which stands at the head of the series of household pets. Men and Monkeys are bracketed by alliteration, as are Parrots and perish (even though the latter is, of course, a verb that retroactively governs all four nouns). This sound pattern isolates Lap-dogs for special attention at the cen- ter of the line, a pampered domestic animal sandwiched in between two jungle creatures removed from their native habitat for the amuse- ment of polite society. The earlier satiric vision of distorted values is recirculated in this brief catalogue but at a higher level of imaginative vehemence: the cosseted canines already equated with husbands are now the pivotal term in a series which points toward the dissolution of all human distinction and which is coupled with a mock-Miltonic en- actment of all things plunging back to universal chaos. A single word of two syllables thus illustrates the mnemonic power of the literary text, its fecund production of internal links that qualify each other and dynamically complicate the network of meanings conveyed. The metaphor of linkages that I have been using is helpful up to a point but in the end its connotations are too mechanical for what goes on in a work of literature. Linkages are what is eminently analyzable in the cohesion of most non-literary texts; in the literary work, they are often so multifarious, involve so many different aspects and levels of language, that they resist anything like full analysis. Indeed, despite the sense of exhaustion of some contemporary critics, that is why there is always more work for criticism to perform. For this dynamic system of multiple and often ambiguous connections within the literary work, the metaphor of a world, often invoked impressionistically by critics and also used more rigorously by some theorists,3 may be the most 3. For a particularly interesting discussion of the world built by the text, see Ben- jamin Hrushovski (1984). Using semiotic terms, Hrushovski refers to the world as the "internal field of reference."</page><page sequence="14">586 Poetics Today 9:3 adequate one. The poet A. R. Ammons states the implication of the world metaphor with nice precision: in every work of literature, he says, "a world [comes] into being about which any statement, however revelatory, is a lessening" (1968: 115). In all intellectual humility, a critic should always keep in mind the lessening, though it may be a price often worth paying for the sake of the revelation. This notion of a world should also make us feel unabashed about using the term literary work, though contemporary practice has preferred the more renunciatory "literary text," which stresses the status of the writing as a weave of words. All literature is that, so the insistence on text may often be perfectly appropriate, but we are also well advised to remember that something is built out of the words (a work) which in the mind of the reader becomes a world. The evocation of a world through the interplay of elements of lan- guage in various ways slipped by the writer out of their conventional grooves is not a quantitative matter: it can happen equally, though dif- ferently, in the seventeen syllables of a haiku or in a novel the length of Middlemarch. Integral illustration from poetry is obviously more feasi- ble, so let me offer as a prooftext a 1926 poem by Robert Frost, "Once by the Pacific." The shattered water made a misty din. Great waves looked over others coming in, And thought of doing something to the shore That water never did to land before. The clouds were low and hairy in the skies, Like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes. You could not tell, and yet it looked as if The shore was lucky in being backed by cliff, The cliff in being backed by continent; It looked as if a night of dark intent Was coming, and not only a night, an age. Someone had better be prepared for rage. There would be more than ocean-water broken Before God's last Put out the Light was spoken. (Lathem 1979: 250) I will begin with what would be in Ammons' terms the most drastic kind of lessening, a thumbnail paraphrase that is in no way revelatory: the speaker in the poem stands by the Pacific shore watching the waves pounding and thinks apprehensively of the destruction of all things. The paraphrase in a way does no more than describe the stimulus for the poem, since it seems safe to assume that Robert Frost was actually moved to this somber musing by looking at the Pacific breakers. How do such thoughts generate a world in which as readers we powerfully experience a sustained moment of highly distinctive menace, waves</page><page sequence="15">Alter * The Difference of Literature 587 raging and apocalypse impending? I say highly distinctive, recognizing that each of us will bring to the reading of the poem his or her own literary and personal associations but also assuming that the elabo- rate structuring of language in these fourteen lines makes them quite different from any other modern apocalyptic poem (Yeats' "Second Coming," the end of T. S. Eliot's "The Hollow Men" and so forth), whatever the vagaries of our individual readings. Frost's use of rhyming iambic pentameter in a fourteen-line piece indicates that the poem is meant to be taken as a variant of the son- net. But the rhymes are a sequence of couplets (AA, BB and so forth), producing no divisions into quatrains or octet and sestet as in the traditional sonnet form. The sense of neat containment, then, gener- ated by the structure of the traditional sonnet is blurred. There may be an underlying tension between the prosodic form of the poem, whether we call it quasi-sonnet or heroic couplets, and the conspic- uously colloquial diction preserved consistently throughout, reflected in the avoidance of the subjunctive after "it looked as if" (using "was," not "were") and flaunted in phrases like "You could not tell," "the shore was lucky," "someone had better . . ." The only word in the entire poem that points toward a more literary diction is "intent," a choice dictated not merely by the rhyme but by the need to suggest something vast, vague, and ominous as the spelling out of the apoc- alypse moves to a climax-moves, moreover, through the only very pronounced enjambment in the poem: "a night of dark intent / Was coming." The colloquial diction is the matrix for a peculiar quality of Frost's poetry here and elsewhere that might be called expressive vagueness and that is felt, as several critics have observed, in his gen- eral fondness for words like "something" and "someone." The use of these words provides an instructive instance of how ordinary language is transmuted as it participates-in the world-building of the poem. The source in spoken English for this usage would be an idiom employed in a situation like the following: an angry child says to another child, Somebody better watch out-meaning, of course, you-or, I'm going to do something to you-meaning, whatever I will do will be so terrible that I would rather not say exactly what. The extraordinary effective- ness of the poem is in part the result of transfering these locutions, with their associations of colloquial vehemence, to a cosmic scale while never committing the sin of pretentiousness I have just committed in using a word like "cosmic." Although, as I have indicated, it is not in principle possible to enu- merate all the kinds of interconnections that engender the world of the literary text, I would point here to four salient aspects of the poem which, together with the expressive vagueness of something/ someone, combine to produce the distinctive mood and tone of this</page><page sequence="16">588 Poetics Today 9:3 version of apocalypse. These are: the chiasm and synesthesia of the first line (more of which in a moment), the pervasive personification of natural forces, the prominence of looking, and the allusions to the first chapter of Genesis. A formal element of a literary text may con- tribute significantly to the building of a world through its placement, through repetition, through the rhetorical emphasis it gets, or through any combination of the three. Thus, zeugma and catalogues help de- fine the world of The Rape of the Lock because they are repeated so frequently, with such inventive variations; and, on the smaller scale of "Once by the Pacific," that is true of personification and the reiterated verb "looked." On the other hand, the first line features two spectacu- lar rhetorical devices that do not occur again in the poem, but, because they form the archway through which we enter into the world of the poem, they play an important part in determining our vision of that world. The line is symmetrical (two nouns, two modifiers,joined by the verb "made" at the midpoint of the line) in the form we call chiastic: A B B A (shattered / water / misty / din). The formal crossover of the chiasm reinforces a crossover between different sensory realms in the imagery (that is, synesthesia): the din is "misty," though mist logically belongs to sight and touch, not sound; and the water is "shattered," as though it were hard and solid, not quite a synesthetic image but com- ing close in its transgression of the borders between different physical states. This coupling of chiasm and synesthesia begins the poem with a terrific sense of the violent interfusion of opposing spheres, solid and liquid, sight and sound, land and sea, and that interfusion is the precondition for the poem's apprehension of apocalypse. The violent mixing of realms is a reversal of one of the organizing thematic fea- tures of Genesis 1: there, creation begins with the spirit of the Lord hovering over the face of the formless waters and it proceeds through an ordered sequence of acts of separation, between the upper and the lower waters, between sea and dry land, between night and day. The allusion becomes explicit only at the end of the poem but it is prepared for at the beginning. As befits a reversal of the work of the anthropomorphic God of the Bible, the force of destruction pulsing through the breakers is personified and felt throughout as a malevolent will: "Great waves looked over others coming in, / And thought of doing something to the shore ...." Perhaps the pronounced personification somehow justifies the rather strange image of the clouds as locks of hair, though I am not so sure of that. In any case, the active "looked" of the personified waves is disturbingly reflected by the impersonal "it looked as if," twice stated, which betokens the looking of the observer at the appearance of those looking waves, that cliff, that descending night. What I called the mnemonic power of the literary work, citing Pope's Lap-dogs as</page><page sequence="17">Alter * The Difference of Literature 589 an illustration, here operates more visibly within the limits of fourteen lines. The mind shuttles back and forth among the three occurrences of "looked," finds itself in a world of menacing appearances behind which there lurks some kind of baleful presence endowed with will. The kind of cohesion we see here is so dense and various that it is qualitatively different from the cohesion of non-literary texts. One of its defining features, moreover, is its dimension of literary allusion. To be sure, ordinary language can scarcely work without recourse to al- lusion. Roland Barthes observes somewhere-rather bleakly, I should think-that no one can say "I love you" to someone else without im- plicitly quoting an antecedent speaker who has recited those same words. Such a notion may push allusion beyond the borders of con- ceptual usefulness. In any case, in the language of literature, allusion of a much more specific sort is a primary coordinate, not an occa- sional resource.4 Making a world in a literary text, a writer joins it to a known class of literary objects, and his world will in one way or another, at varying levels of explictness, incorporate bits of previous texts, changing them to suit its own immanent laws. God's Put out the Light in the last line of "Once by the Pacific" is, of course, a canceling of the divine Let there be light in Genesis 1 and, as we noted, makes explicit the intimations of an undoing of biblical creation earlier in the poem. Because literary tradition repeatedly recapitulates itself, al- lusions may be layered, and I suspect that is true here. A reversal of Genesis, running the reel back, as it were, from seventh day to chaos and void, presides over the conclusion of Pope's Dunciad: Lo! thy dread Empire, CHAOS! is restor'd; Light dies before thy uncreating word: Thy hand, great Anarch! lets the curtain fall; And Universal Darkness buries All. (IV: 653-656) Put out the Light is also exactly the sentence Othello says, twice, in the brief soliloquy just before he murders Desdemona. Are we intended at the end of Frost's poem to recall Shakespeare's image of a dark man enraged with jealousy about to destroy the beautiful woman he passionately loves? There is no way of knowing whether Frost meant that echo to be heard, but the very possibility of its presence suggests how the accumulated images, themes, and actual verbal formulations of literary tradition become charged particles in the mind of the writer (and "mind" is surely more than what is conscious and intentional) and of the reader. The presence of these layered associations and meanings, of this 4. Allusion is so central to literary expression that it will need to be considered at length in a separate discussion.</page><page sequence="18">590 Poetics Today 9:3 fine network of internal connections does not imply that the literary work is inherently a model of perfection. Poems and plays and stories are, after all, created by human beings like you and me, and even some of the greatest exhibit moments when the imagination flags, when the weaving of meaningful patterns slackens, when contradictions slide in that may not contribute to any ultimate richness of paradoxical state- ment. There could in fact be just such an unproductive dissonance in the hairy clouds blown across eyes of Frost's poem, however much one might try to accommodate those two lines to the structure of the poem by linking them both with the personification and the theme of looking. The possible presence of flaws in any literary achievement -and in my view "Once by the Pacific" remains a very remarkable poem-ought to steer us away from a mystification of the literary text, which is by no means a necessary consequence of recognizing its dis- tinctiveness. The performance of the language of literature can be as uneven as the performance of any other kind of language. There are, of course, more and less accomplished speakers but even the most elo- quent may from time to time lisp or slur. This means that, as readers, we will sometimes run the risk of inventing a connection in the text where there is only a gap. For the most part, however, the dangers of overreading are far outweighed by the dangers of underreading, a habit to which modern culture, with its popular journalism and its rapid electronic messages, predisposes us. The language of literature abundantly draws on ordinary language and achieves its coherences through operations that are sometimes in- structively analogous to those of ordinary language, but it carries them to a higher exponential power, transmits through them messages of a different order. To read this language adequately requires a pre- hensile activity of the mind on the details of the text as it unfolds, a willingness to entertain multiple and unresolved meanings, an open- ness to the pleasures in the sound and look and combination of the words. All three of these capacities are bound to grow the more one reads and that is probably why at the moment they are in a general state of decay. But there is a necessary, if subordinate, place for literary studies alongside reading. Analytic attention to the distinctive formal resources of literature is never a substitute for the immediate experi- ence of reading but it can give us a sharper focus on the dynamic play of elements in what we read. And precisely because so many of our reading habits these days are acquired through exposure to thinner, more univocal, less complexly pleasurable uses of language, we need to understand more clearly the inflections and the underlying patterns of the special language of literature.</page><page sequence="19">Alter * The Difference of Literature 591 References Ammons, A.
