<plain_text><page sequence="1">Urbanism on Late Bronze Age Cyprus: LC II in Retrospect Ora Negbi Institute of Archaeology Tel Aviv University Ramat Aviv, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel onegbi@post.tau.ac.il In memory of Professor Emily T. Vermeule* The emergence of urbanism marks a profound change in the settlement pattern that prevailed on Cyprus during the prehistoric and protohistoric eras. Following the Neolithic "agricultural revolution " that evolved into the "secondary products revolu tion" of the Late Chalcolithic and Early Cypriot Bronze ages, urbanization was the most prominent innovation of the Middle/Late Cypriot Bronze Age transition. In retrospect, scholars are still wondering why the urban revolution started on Cyprus fairly late com pared with other islands in the Mediterranean. However, it is generally agreed that the gradual movement from rural hinterland to coastal towns was not merely an internal so cioeconomic process, but rather the outcome of overseas demand for Cypriot copper. Archaeological excavations indicate that the process of urbanization accelerated during the Late Cypriot period, although there is no consensus as to when it started to decline. Given the archaeological and historical evidence, it appears that on Cyprus this process was not an isolated local phenomenon. This paper reassesses the state of Late Cypriot urbanism in its wider Mediterranean perspective. INTRODUCTION Recent p?trographie analyses of five "Ala shiya Tablets" found in the palatial archives of El-Amarna and Ugarit (now in the British Museum and the Mus?e du Louvre) indicate that the fabric of these clay tablets, addressed by the "King of Alashiya" to his Egyptian and Syrian royal coun terparts in the 14th-13th centuries b.c.e., originated in Cyprus (Goren et al. 2003; 2004). Consequently, the analyzed tablets (four from El-Amarna and one from Ugarit) provide decisive support to those schol ars who maintain that the toponym "Alashiya," also mentioned in other documents of the second millen nium (Egyptian, Syrian, Babylonian, Anatolian, and Mycenaean), is to be located on Cyprus, and more specifically, in a certain territorial entity of the island * This paper is dedicated to the memory of Professor Emily T. Vermeule, who was the first to introduce me, more than 30 years ago, to the archaeology of Cyprus by kindly inviting me to participate in the Toumba tou Skourou excavations following a sabbatical at Harvard University (1971-1972). (Stech 1982; Baurain 1984: 19-25, 186-233, 277 321; Knapp 1985; Charpin 1992; Hadjisavvas 1996a).1 There is an ongoing debate as to whether urbanism on Cyprus reached its prime in LC IIC or in LC IIIA (Karageorghis 1990; Merrillees 1992; Knapp 1994; 1997b; South 1995; Manning 1998). Eighteen years ago I postulated that Cypriot urbanism peaked in LC IIC (Negbi 1986). The present paper elaborates on that view by comparing the state of Cypriot urban ism just before and just after the upheavals that ex panded throughout the Mediterranean ca. 1200 b.c.e. in the light of the updated archaeological, historical, and related data. However, the main purpose of this paper is to reevaluate the archaeological evidence available from Cypriot Bronze Age towns in order to find out whether the given evidence necessarily *It has been noticed that most of the El-Amarna letters addressed to the "King of Alashiya" mention neither his name nor the site on the island where he was residing (Merrillees 1992: 310 11; Goren et al. 2003: 247).</page><page sequence="2">2 ORA NEGBI BASOR 337 5222GE3?E maa; ?KOUKLIA? itoumba to? skourou SOLO! i : APUKH ?L : /. ;?:::--:W:-?IP/K/ra.

Map of Cyprus with the main sites mentioned in the text. implies that the political and administrative center of the island in the 14th-13th centuries shifted from the eastern coast to the southern margins of the Troodos massif (fig. 1), as my Tel Aviv University colleagues suggest (Goren et al. 2003: 250-52; 2004: 70-75). TEMPORAL DILEMMAS The chronological framework of this paper has been designated "Proto Bronze Age" (henceforth "ProBA") by Knapp (1993: 90, table 1; 1997b: 35, table 1). Knapp's ProBA, which ranges from the closing phase of the Middle Cypriot (henceforth MC III) to the end of the Late Cypriot period (hence forth LC IIIB) seems too schematic, as it ignores the essence of successive phases and subphases main tained in the traditional terminology (Warren and Hankey 1989: 118). However, the new terminology is currently more widely accepted and therefore is used here only as a framework of the traditional ter minology. Unfortunately, the upper and lower limits of ProBA are loosely defined, as the validity of sev eral Cypriot synchronisms with Egypt, the Levant, and the Aegean have recently been subjected to substantial controversy.2 New calibrated radiocar bon dates of well-stratified samples from Cyprus, si multaneously analyzed by various laboratories, are of special importance, since they establish the abso lute chronology of LC IIC and consequently resolve the ambiguity of ca. 1200 b.c.e. as a datum line for the LC IIC/LC IIIA transition (Manning, Weninger, et al. 2001). As such, these analyses offer indepen dent confirmation to the historical validity of this very date and provide archaeologists, for the first time, with a reliable temporal framework for future research (table 1). 2This controversy actually focuses on two crucial issues: the absolute date of the Thera eruption and the earliest appearance of Greek Protogeometric pottery in the Levant and Cyprus (Manning 1999: 321-66; Fantalkin 2001; Coldstream and Mazar 2003: 40 44; Gilboa and Sharon 2003).</page><page sequence="3">2005 URBANISM ON LATE BRONZE AGE CYPRUS Table 1.

PATTERNS OF SETTLEMENT IN PROBA CYPRUS Since Catling's pioneer study (1962), Patterns of Settlement in Bronze Age Cyprus, there has been a growing tendency among scholars to challenge the conventional historical archaeology with combined studies of material remains, environmental research, and data from other disciplines (Hodder 1986; Knapp 1996; 1997b: 7-18). This trend, as exemplified by the p?trographie analyses of the "Alashiya Tablets" and the calibrated radiocarbon dating of organic remains (see above), provides more objective clues to the extent and nature of human activity on the island. Moreover, settlement patterns are regarded by Knapp (1996: 55-58) as the outcome of the way people ad just to a variety of ecological, economic, or social con straints. Therefore, it is fashionable today to apply methods of regional survey and landscape archaeol ogy in order to "facilitate a more dynamic human centered approach to the past" (Knapp 1996: 57). The settlement pattern of ProBA Cyprus cannot be studied without considering the political, socioeco nomic, and demographic complexity of the island. In this respect, LC IIC gives us the best database to de fine sites of two main categories: urban and nonurban (tables 2, 3). By the same token, there seems to be a direct connection between the location and the role of any given site (coastal and inland, respectively) within the overall hierarchy of settlements during this period. Geological studies reveal that drastic changes of the coastline have direct bearing on the present lo cation of many archaeological sites (Davidson 1985; Kraft, Kay an, and Aschenbrenner 1985; Rapp and Hill 1998: 75-91). As a result, it is suggested here that, unlike coastal towns such as Enkomi, which lies in the eastern edge of the Mesaoria Plain, about 2 km from the sea, "problematic" sites such as Kalavasos Ayios Dhimitrios, which lies midway between the southeastern foothills of the Troodos and the sea, are to be defined as inland towns (fig. 1 ; table 2:1,6). Ad ditional considerations, based on archaeological cri teria, provide a tentative pattern of the settlements (urban and nonurban, respectively) on ProBA Cyprus. Urban Sites "A town is defined by its role within a system of economic relations, i.e., by its function as a central place. . . . Quantitative aspects?as the number of in habitants and size of the settled area?are of second ary importance. The same is true for the urban way of life and plurality of architectural patterns, includ ing the existence of a city wall" (Klengel 1990: 3). LC IIC urban centers vary in size from 10 to 70 ha (Knapp 1997b: 53, fig. 5), but their status does not necessarily correspond to their size (Merrillees 1992: 318). Unfortunately, however, excavations do not pro vide decisive evidence as to whether all the urban set tlements were fortified.3 A glance at the map (fig. 1) indicates, as would be expected, that given the insularity of Cyprus (Held 1993), urban settlements prevail along the coast, and mainly in the major bays of Famagusta, Larnaca, Li massol, Akrotiri, and Morphou. The spatial pattern of Late Cypriot urban sites may be summarized as follows (table 2). First, the number of early LC I towns founded along the eastern, southern, and western coasts of the island?i.e., at Enkomi, Hala Sultan Tekke, Kourion, 3 With the exception of Enkomi and Kition (table 2:1, 3) which were protected by massive walls and solid towers (or bastions), ex cavations of other urban sites are mostly restricted to small sound ings that seldom extend to the edges of any given site. Therefore, the size of many urban centers on Cyprus is highly tentative (Mer rillees 1992: 316-18, 328; Knapp 1996: 80; 1997b: 53-54, fig. 3).</page><page sequence="4">ORA NEGBI BASOR 337 Table 2.

Fluctuation in number of LC IA to LC 1MB urban centers. and Toumba tou Skourou?almost doubled by LC IIC (fig. 2). The new LC II towns of Kition Kathari, Maroni-Vournes, and Koukliz-Palaepa phos were?like the older ones?also located by the sea. However, the most prominent innovation of LC IIC was the foundation in the Vasilikos and Kouris Valleys of two inland towns: Kalavasos-Ay/?s Dhi mitrios and Alassa-Paliotaverna, thus increasing the density of urban centers in southern Cyprus at that date. Second, the number of urban centers peaked in LC IIC and sharply decreased in LC IIIA (fig. 2) with the abandonment of Toumba tou Skourou, Maroni, and Ay ios Dhimitrios. As a result, maritime connec tions between the only harbor town in northwest Cyprus {Toumba tou Skourou) and the Aegean were cut off. In the hinterland to the south, only Alassa still retained its status in LC IIIA. Yet, the existing coastal towns of Enkomi, Kition, Kourion, and pre sumably Kouklia-Palaepaphos as well were rebuilt after the destructions ca. 1200, whereas Hala Sultan Tekke was already deserted before the end of LC IIIA (1100 B.c.E.). Furthermore, in contrast to LC IIC, not a single newly founded town has so far been ascribed to LC IIIA. Third, the beginning of LC IIIB marked the rise of a new series of urban sites along the eastern and southern coasts of the island (Iacovou 1994; Buitron Oliver and Herscher 1997; Rupp 1997; Reyes 1997; Yon 1999). While Enkomi preserved its importance among the coastal emporia, a new major harbor founded at Salamis replaced the old silted-up one at Enkomi in the Bay of Famagusta (table 2:1, 2). Sim ilar changes were also taking place at Kition, where the northern quarter of Kathari extended eastward, creating a new quarter on the Bamboula (Yon 2002), the harbor of which offered better anchorage facili ties than those of the old quarter. Moreover, it seems likely that following the desertion of Hala Sultan Tekke, Kition remained the only LC IIIB emporium in the Bay of Larnaca (table 2:3, 4). Simultaneously, building activities are also evidenced in the bays of Limassol and Morphou, with the foundation of Amathus and Soloi (table 2:7, 11). It is noteworthy, however, that the foundation date of Amathus is controversial (Iacovou 2002). In any event, LC IIIB Soloi probably inherited the abandoned harbor town of Toumba tou Skourou (table 2:11, 12). No substi tute centers have so far been proposed for the aban doned inland towns of LC IIC Kalavasos-Ay/as Dhimitrios, or for LC IIC-LC IIIA Alassa (table 2:6, 9). Still, the foundation of Soloi provided an im portant addition to the growing number of LC IIIB harbor towns on Cyprus, thus equaling that of LC IIC. Furthermore, at Idalion-Ambelleri in the center of the island (tables 2:13; 3:F4), a new LC IIIB town had emerged, indicating that Cypriot urbanism had almost been restored in the closing phase of the ProBA (fig. 2). Nonurban Sites The political, economic, and sociodemographic complexity of urban settlements on ProBA Cyprus (on the coast and inland alike) cannot be studied in isolation, but rather must be seen in relation to the overall pattern of settlements, including villages, "rural sanctuary sites," and "fortified settlements" (table 3; fig. 1). Villages. Located in the island's hinterland are at least five mining and agricultural villages (table 3:V1-V5) extending from the slopes of the Troodos, with its natural resources of copper, wood, and wild/ domesticated olive trees, down to the arable lands of the Mesaoria Plain and various river valleys (Hadjisavvas 1992: 2-4; Raptou 1996; Given et al. 2002; Keswani and Knapp 2003: 219). Quantitative comparisons (tables 2, 3) indicate that Late Cypriot villages were considerably outnumbered by urban settlements (5 vs. 13). However, this ratio is probably</page><page sequence="6">6 ORA NEGBI BASOR 337 unreliable, since towns tend to be better preserved (apparently due to the quality of their architecture) than villages. Hence, the ratio should actually be re versed, as even today a single urban center is de pendent on substantial provisions and the labor force of several rural satellites. Archaeological evidence does not seem to provide us with the actual number of Late Cypriot villages. In any event, it has recently been argued that "in considering economic, political and social complexity without necessarily linking it to urbanism, several questions emerge considering the nature of landscape and ideas of rurality" (Ches son and Philip 2003: 11). "Rural Sanctuary Sites." This term has been ap plied to rural settlements that contain cult enclosures (temenoi), in which an altar and other cult parapher nalia were found (?str?m 1972: 11). Unfortunately, in several cases it is difficult to decide whether the t?menos is related to a specific rural site (Webb 1999: 18, table 1). As a result, only three reliable rural sanctuary sites (table 3:S1-S3) can be safely identi fied: one coastal (Ayia-Irini) and two inland ones (Myrtou-Pighades and Athienou-Bamboulari).4 Sta tistically, however, the number of genuine rural sanctuary sites is too small to allow proper discus sion of their function throughout ProBA Cyprus. "Fortified Settlements" Located in naturally stra tegic places, either along the coast or farther inland, the so-called fortified settlements (table 3:F1-F4) belong to a distinctive category of military architec ture diagnostic of two crucial eras in the ProBA history of the island (Fortin 1981: 482-553; Kara georghis 2001). Assigned to the first era (MC III/LC I transition), a time of instability and sociodemographic changes in Egypt, the Levant, and the Aegean, is inter alia the massive fortress of Nitovikla, which had to de fend the Karpass Peninsula (fig. 1) against intrusions from the Syro-Cilician coast. The second era actu ally started in the closing years of LC IIC when ur ban Cyprus was still in its prime, and continued into LC IIIA when it was already in decline. Founded in LC IIC, the coastal strongholds of Pyla-Kokkino 4At least three open cult places including ?La\opsidha-Koufos, Ayios Iakovos-D/ma, and Phlamoudhi-Melissa are of inconclusive nature (Astr?m 1972: 11, fig. 1; Webb 1999: 18, table 1). As such, they have been excluded from table 4. For a r??valuation of the Phlamoudhi excavations, see Nestor 31,8: 3925. kremos and Maa-Palaeokastro (table 3:F1, F2) had to block infiltrations into eastern and western Cy prus. The destruction and abandonment of Pyla cor responds to the collapse of many urban centers on Cyprus and elsewhere ca. 1200, whereas the reoccu pation of Maa in LC IIIA coincides with the remain ing urban centers that survived the crisis years of the 12th century. Simultaneously, the fortified settle ments of Sinda (in the Mesaoria Plain) and Idalion Ambelleri (on the Ayios Sozomenos Plateau), had to secure the terrestrial routes connecting the hinter land with coastal settlements in the bays of Fama gusta and Larnaca (table 3:F3, F4). Founded in LC IIC and probably reinforced in LC IIIA, Sinda (Astr?m 2003; Adelman 2003) still requires a thor ough r??valuation. The history of Idalion is contro versial, but there are indications that the fortified settlement of Ambelleri, erected in LC IIC, contin ued throughout LC IIIA and became a major urban center in LC IIIB (tables 2:13; 3:F4). In this respect, Idalion participated in the revival of urbanization in the closing phase of ProBA Cyprus (see fig. 2). URBAN CYPRUS IN THE 14TH-13TH CENTURIES B.C.E. Merrillees (1992: 321) has pointed out that "prior to the 13th century b.c.e. there is nothing in the ex cavated record to give any idea of how the govern ment of the island may have been conducted." The linkage of urban development to the political and socioeconomic changes that took place on Cyprus at that date has been thoroughly discussed by Keswani (1993; 1996), who offered a stimulating theoretical model of coexistence among a number of regional heterarchic LC IIC polities. Her model implies that in this period the island was divided into at least six independent regional entities, each headed by one (Enkomi, Maroni, Kourion, Kouklia, and Toumba tou Skourou) or two (Kition and/or Hala Sultan Tekke) coastal emporta (fig. 1). She believed that inland towns (like Kalavasos-Ay/?s Dhimitrios and Alassa) were thus "secondary" compared with the "primary" coastal centers. However, given the location of the inland towns, Keswani (1993: 79, figs. 2, 3) sug gested that they "would have served not only as trans shipment points for semi-processed copper, but also as the foci for the collection of agricultural 'tribute.' " She argued that, in this capacity, inland towns and rural sanctuary sites played an important economic</page><page sequence="7">2005 URBANISM ON LATE BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 7 role as mediators between villages and "primary" coastal centers of the regional (and probably interre gional) polities on Cyprus at that time. Keswani's model is not generally accepted (Knapp 1997b: 46 63), however. Given the natural connection between inland and coastal towns, as best attested by the pos sibility of sailing down the Kouris River from Alassa to Kourion (Hadjisavvas 1996a; Christou 1997; Knapp 1997b: 48-57), we must consider an alternative hierarchic model, the political, cultural, and economic implications of which are discussed below. Political Entities Keswani's model of peer polities that emerged on Cyprus in LC IIC may be regarded as an insular version of Late Bronze Age city-states of the Levant and Mycenaean Greece. Based on analogies overseas, the stability of each Cypriot political entity similarly depended on interaction between urban centers and their periphery (Falconer 1994). Topography played a crucial role in town planning, as the flat terrain of Enkomi and Hala Sultan Tekke (table 2:1, 4) per fectly suited the orthogonal layout, including sepa rated, well-defined quarters (Courtois, Lagarce, and Lagarce 1986: 5-7, fig. 2; Negbi 1986: 101-3, 106 7, fig. 3; ?str?m 1989: 9-10, fig. l).5It seems likely that the coastal polity of Enkomi was not confined to Famagusta Bay, but expanded farther inland to in clude the eastern part of the fertile Mesaoria Plain. As for Kition and Hala Sultan Tekke in the Bay of Larnaca, one may wonder why the two sites were lo cated so close together. It has been suggested that they should be regarded as "independent centers or 'peers,' but whether they coexisted as rivals or allies is uncertain" (Keswani 1996: 228-29). A possible explanation for their proximity may be found in the dates of their foundation and the ethnicity of their founders. Hala Sultan Tekke, which dates back to the MC III/LC I "urban revolution," was a local en deavor, whereas Kition was founded later, in LC 5 The validity of assigning the residential quarter in Area 8 at Hala Sultan Tekke to LC IIIA cannot be accepted since the gridded layout of this area with its angular, jt-shaped buildings is diagnos tic of LC IIC. The discovery of a faience mace head bearing the cartouche of Horemheb on the floor of Building A (Astr?m 1984: fig. 5 a-b) and a surface find of a Canaanite jar handle stamped with the cartouche of Seti I (?strom 1965; 1984) support the as sumption that the foundation of this quarter must have taken place before the accession of the 20th Dynasty. IIC, apparently by traders from the opposite coast of Lebanon. Interaction with Anatolia and the Levant Hittite influence on the military architecture of its vassal states in Syria and Cyprus has already been discussed by Fortin (1981: 505-20) and Baurain (1984: 244-51). However, it appears that the city state model was introduced to Cyprus from the Le vant (Savage and Falconer 2003). This phenomenon is best exemplified by Ugarit and Enkomi?the two most extensively excavated emporia in the north eastern corner of the Mediterranean that lie only some 200 km apart (fig. 5). Ugarit, the major Hittite vassal on the north Syrian coast, was apparently the origin of two main innovations at Enkomi in LC IIC: town planning and ashlar masonry. Comparative studies reveal that the original Hippodamian layout of Enkomi (fig. 3) is closely related to the palatial sectors of Ugarit at Ras Ibn Hani. Similarly, at both Enkomi and Ugarit, ashlar masonry was used for secular, sacred, and funerary architecture. Secular Architecture. Included in the category of secular architecture are two monumental edifices at Enkomi: "B?timent 18" (fig. 3:C) and the misnamed "Sanctuary of the Horned God" (fig. 3:B)?a pair of square buildings of identical size located in the north western sector of the site. Their ashlar masonry, in general, and the impressive southern fa?ade of the former structure (built of huge orthostates installed on a massive plinth of solid, marginally dressed stones), in particular (Negbi 1986: pis. 24, 1; 25, 2; Karageorghis 1990: pi. 11, 2), are closely related to those of the "Palais Royal" and "Palais Nord" lo cated on the western acropolis of Ras Shamra-Ugarit (Margueron 1995: photos 3-9). It has been postu lated that ashlar masonry, which became fashionable all over the island in LC IIC, is to be regarded as "one of the principal, and certainly the most visible prestige symbols that a ruler could employ" (Kara georghis 1990: 20).6 6The origin of Cypriot "ashlar" masonry is problematic (Huit 1983: 1-2). In fact, there are substantial differences between the "true" ashlars of the first-millennium monumental constructions (ranging from the Iron Age to the Roman period) and the "pseudo" ashlars dating back to third-millennium Egypt, which became in creasingly popular in second-millennium Anatolia, the Levant, Cyprus, and the Aegean.

Plan of Enkomi in LC IIC-LC MIA (after Negbi 1986: fig. 3). used for Bronze Age shell-type walls whose core, filled with rub ble and mud, was actually hidden by well-dressed blocks (ortho states), thus looking like true ashlar construction. Exceptionally high-standing walls of this type at Kommos were constructed in LM IA and continued to be used (after a hiatus) in LM IIIA and IIIB (Shaw 1983; Shaw and Shaw 1993: 129-37, 161-82). How ever, the earliest ashlar construction on Cyprus is that of the for tress of Nitovikla in the Karpass Peninsula, which corresponds to the foundation of the first towns on the island in MC III/LC I, presumably due to Syrian inspirations (Huit 1994). "Pseudo" ashlar masonry was especially common among fa?ades of Cypriot public buildings (occasionally installed on true ashlar plinths of marginal drafted stones), comparable to Syrian and Minoan counterparts (Huit 1983: 2-20). My previous claim that "pseudo" ashlar ma sonry on Cyprus is diagnostic of LC IIC rather than LC IIIA (Negbi 1986) gains decisive confirmation from the architectural remains of the single-period town of Ayios Dhimitrios and the stratified evidence of Alassa-Paliotaverna (above, table 2:6, 9).</page><page sequence="9">2005 URBANISM ON LATE BRONZE AGE CYPRUS Table 4.

The two monumental ashlar buildings at Enkomi (fig. 3:B, C) share a basic squarish contour with the Palais Sud at Ras Ibn Hani (Bounni 1982; Lagarce 1982), although the inner layout of the Palais Sud is quite different. This palace is actually a concise version of the "Hilani"-type royal edifices that were popular in the capitals of Hittite vassal states in north Syria (including, in addition to Ugarit, also Alalakh, Zinjirli, and Emar-Meskene) in the 13th century (Mar gueron 1995). However, Muhly (1985: 42-43) has rightly pointed out that, unlike in the Near East and the Aegean, palatial edifices did not exist on Bronze Age Cyprus. The two monumental Enkomi build ings give an impression of multiroomed, labyrinthine complexes (Courtois, Lagarce, and Lagarce 1986: 13-20, fig. 2: 4W, 5W), but this impression is mis leading, since the original LC IIC plan of both build ings was drastically changed during the LC IIIA reoccupation (Negbi 1986: 104-5). Wright (1992: 211-12, 508-9) has shown that the LC IIC plan of the Enkomi buildings evolved from a basic type of Jt-shaped farmhouse dating back to the Middle Cypriot. These four-spaced houses (consisting of a small inner court flanked by two rooms and backed by a third) developed into the sophisticated civic buildings, industrial units, mili tary barracks, and domestic architecture of LC IIC urban centers and fortified settlements, respectively (table 4).7 The arrangement by status shown in table 4 is based on a working hypothesis that the hierarchy of the jr-shaped buildings is determined by three main factors: location, masonry, and size. This hypothesis, if valid, implies that (a) most of the Jt-shaped ashlar buildings (with only one exception) are of higher status than those built of undressed stones (table 4: Grades 1-3 vs. 4,6-7); and (b) ashlar buildings found in coastal urban sites (TC) are generally of higher status than those recorded from inland urban sites (TH), as demonstrated by Enkomi, Alassa-Paliota verna, and Ay ios Dhimitrios (table 4: Grade 1 vs. 2a, 2b). These sites actually confirm Keswani's hier archic model (1993: 78-80, figs. 1, 2) of "primary" coastal centers vs. "secondary" inland ones.8 It also implies that, considering the fact that two jr-shaped identical buildings were functioning at Enkomi in 7The spatial resemblance between 7c-shaped Cypriote buildings and Israelite four-room houses (i.e., Bunimovitz and Faust 2003) is beyond the scope of this paper. However, regardless of temporal considerations, there is no doubt that similar considerations dic tated similar architectural solutions for multifunctional Bronze Age and Iron Age farmhouses in Cyprus and the southern Levant. 8There is only one case in which an ashlar 71-shaped building of a coastal town (Maroni-Vournes) is of a lower status than that</page><page sequence="10">10 ORA NEGBI BASOR 337 Fig. 4.

LC IIC (fig. 3:B, C), and that each of them was larger than its counterparts at other urban sites (table 4: Grade 1 vs. 2-7), Enkomi can safely be placed at the top of the urban hierarchy on the island at that date. Sacred Architecture. Included in the category of sacred architecture are five ashlar buildings that belong to Wright's (1992: 212) "Old Mediterranean of inland towns (Alassa-Paliotaverna and Kalavasos-Ay/os Dhi mitrios). This may indicate that the small anchorage of Maroni Tsaroukkas (table 4:4) was of secondary importance compared with the natural facilities of the major harbor towns. Moreover, the sta tus of Maroni- Vournes is lower than that of Enkomi, Alassa, and Ayios Dhimitrios (table 4: Grade 3 vs. 1, 2), because its "Ashlar Building," unlike its coastal counterparts, has production and stor age facilities for olive oil which correspond to those of its inland counterparts. Given the local tradition of Jt-shaped buildings re corded from the fortified settlements of Fy\a-Kokkinokremos and Maa-Palaeokastro (table 3:F1, F2), it seems likely that neither site was founded by outsiders, as Karageorghis (1990: 7-10, figs. 4, 15) has suggested, but were part of a defensive system of the local Cypriot polities against foreign intrusions. The former site was ap parently intended to defend coastal urban sites in the Bay of Lar naca from the east, whereas the latter was designed to block penetrations into the Palaepaphos region from the west. temple," a long-house of bent-axial layout (with benches in the main hall and an adyton at the back) of fixed proportions (the length approximately doubles the width). Cult buildings of this type, which were introduced from the Levant to Cyprus, and also expanded to the Cyclades (Phylakopi) and the P?loponn?se (Mycenae) in the latter quarter of the second millennium, evolved into diagnostic Phoenician temples in the Levant (such as Sarepta), Cyprus (Kition), and Crete (Kommos) during the early quarter of the first millennium (Negbi 1988; 1992: 601-7; Mazar 2000). The earliest traces of Near Eastern architectural tradition on Cyprus are clearly evidenced in the ProBA coastal towns of Enkomi, Kition, Hala Sultan Tekke, and Kouklm-Palaepaphos (table 2:1, 3, 4, 10). The layout of Area II at Kition-Kathari, which occupied the northernmost sector of the site, is quite confusing. It seems to me, following a long, labori ous consideration, that the stratigraphy of this sector in general and that of the LC IIC-LC IIIA archi tectural remains (Floors IV-IIIA-III) in particular (Karageorghis and Demas 1985: 24-164; still main tained by Webb 1999: 37-44, 64-81, figs. 9-11) re quire the following changes (fig. 4). Founded in the</page><page sequence="11">2005 URBANISM ON LATE BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 11 "Sacred Area" were two temenoi (A, B) and a pair of adjoining ashlar buildings (Temples 1, 2).9 The tem ples are of different size but the same orientation (their adyta located at the west) and share a similar plan characteristic of the "Old Mediterranean" type. The two buildings were actually the original compo nents of a double temple complex founded at Kition in LC IIC (Floor IV), which has its best prototypes at Kamid-el-Loz in the Lebanon Valley. This impor tant city-state is most relevant to Kition, as it offers an excellent case study of the religious concept em bodied in a joint structure of major and minor shrines dating to the 14th century (Negbi 1989: 202*, 224, fig. 9). The same concept is most certainly exempli fied by the pair of LC IIC ashlar temples at Kition (Floor IV). Levantine footprints are also evidenced in the "B?timent ? la Colonne" and the "Sanctuary of the Ingot God" located in the eastern sector of Enkomi (fig. 3:F, E). The former building (Courtois, Lagarce, and Lagarce 1986: 37-40, figs. 7-8, pi. 13; Webb 1999: 116-19, fig. 49) recalls in both layout and size the "Temple aux Rhytons" discovered in a residen tial quarter at Ugarit (Yon 1996). The history of the "Ingot God" sanctuary is inconclusive. However, a recent stratigraphie r??valuation led Webb (2001: 70-73, figs. 2-4) to suggest that the life span of this sanctuary ranged from two LC IIC phases (Sols. VI V) to four phases (Sols. IV-I) dating to LC IIIA-LC IIIB (see below, "The Aftermath"). Other temples have been found at Hala Sultan Tekke and Kouklia-Palaepaphos (table 2:4, 10). The 9I have previously postulated, contra Karageorghis and Demas (1985), that Temple 3, assigned to LC IIC (Floor IV), was not a cult structure but a workshop (Negbi 1989: 223, nn. 21-22). In fact, Karageorghis's axiomatic assumption in assigning the foundation of Temple 1 (the huge forerunner of the Phoenician "Temple of As tarte") to LC IILA was inspired by Dikaios, who did not believe that ashlar masonry was used on the island prior to LC IILA. Conse quently, based on circular argumentations, Karageorghis (1990: 20) has arbitrarily assigned the foundation of Temple 1 to LC IILA (Floors Ilia, III) because the absence of ashlar masonry at Kition in LC IIC "cannot be simply a matter of local state or architectural traditions," but seems to imply that "Kition had not yet achieved sufficient stature to erect such a grand public fa?ade." However, it is more logical to argue that LC IIC monumental ashlar fa?ades were not restricted to "B?timent 18" at Enkomi, but also included the southern fa?ade of Temple 1 at Kition and Temple I at Kouklia Palaepaphos. Moreover, when arguing that ashlar masonry was first used in the original LC IILA construction, Karageorghis (fol lowed by Webb 1999: 37-44, figs. 9, 11, respectively), tends to ignore the case of Temple 2 at Kition whose original LC IIC ashlar masonry cannot be overlooked. former, originating in the residential quarter of Vizaja (Area 8), sits adjacent to the harbor (?str?m 1989: 11-12, fig. 1); and the latter, erected on an isolated hill approaching the sea, lies under the Roman "Sanc tuary of Aphrodite" (Maier and Karageorghis 1984: 50-102, figs. 28, 74, 81-82). The Hala Sultan Tekke shrine, with its indirect entry, axial row of column bases, and adyton at the corner of the rear wall (Kara georghis 1990: 16-17, pi. 9.1; Webb 1999: 127-30, fig. 53), belongs to "temples of irregular plan," a dis tinctive variant of Wright's "Old Mediterranean" type whose Syro-Palestinian parallels span the sec ond half of the second millennium b.c.e. (Mazar 1980: 52-65, fig. 15:E, G, J, N; Negbi 1988). Unlike its Canaanite counterparts, however, the Hala Sultan Tekke temple was incorporated into House C, one of the jt-shaped dwelling complexes in Area 8 (?str?m 1989: fig. 3). The disturbed remains of Sanctuary 1 at Kouklia-Palaepaphos, which closely correspond to the canonic layout of "Old Mediterranean" tem ples, have been regarded by Webb (1999: 64) as rep resenting "one of the most monumental of all existing LB Age cult buildings" that was undoubtedly "of considerable importance in Western Cyprus." The validity of her assumption is questionable, since it seems to me that, as in the case of secular jt-shaped buildings (table 4), the hierarchy of the "Old Medi terranean" temples can be determined by their loca tion, masonry, and size (table 5). Comparative data reveal that the size of ashlar Temple 1 at Kition surpasses that of all the reli gious edifices listed in table 5 (Grade 1 vs. 2-5). Needless to recall, this temple, together with its mi nor counterpart (Temple 2), served (with certain in ner changes) as a focal cult center in LC IIIA (Floors IIIA-III) and beyond during the first millennium b.c.e. (Negbi 1992: 604, n. 20, and above n. 9).10 Funerary Architecture. Ashlar-built tombs are among the most convincing evidence for a distinc tive Ugaritic influence on Late Cypriot Enkomi.

Those main taining the emulation option rely primarily on the claim that the Enkomi tombs "lacked the elaborately vaulted roofs" of their Syrian counterparts; and sec ond, on the premise that "the finds recorded in the Enkomi tombs are not notably dissimilar from those observed in contemporaneous chamber tombs with rich assemblages" found at the site. According to Keswani (1989: 55, table 1), the assemblages of the Enkomi subterranean tombs "having most costly and elaborate construction?i.e., the ashlar masonry? appear to have been rivaled and sometimes surpassed in wealth and status paraphernalia by assemblages of some rock-cut tombs." Therefore, her claim (1989: 69) that these mortuary variabilities "may reflect not only the complexity of the sociopolitical hierar 11 The precise chronological range of these tombs is incon clusive, mainly because most of them were not found intact and the houses to which they originally belonged were razed by the Swedish excavators at this quarter. It appears, however, that the three earliest tombs, which do not predate LC IIB, were still used in LC IIC, whereas the later two were built in LC IIC (Courtois, Lagarce, and Lagarce 1986: 24-30, figs. 1:16; 4:A.B.C; Keswani 1989: 54-55). chy . . ., but also the ongoing competition and fluc tuating political dominance among the diverse elite groups resident within the walls of Enkomi" is more reasonable. It seems to me, however, that this di versity is partly due to ethnic differences between local and foreign elites. The former were buried in traditional rock-cut chamber tombs, whereas the lat ter were interred in a small group of foreign-styled ashlar-built tombs. This suggestion, if valid, implies that elite families of Ugaritic traders possessed living and burial places in the Artisans' Quarter at Enkomi and were also practicing their own cult in a sectorial shrine (B?timent ? la Colonne) located nearby (fig. 3:F; table 5: Grade 2). This suggestion gains credence from a document found at Ugarit (RS 11. 857) listing the heads of 29 Ugaritic families and their women, children, and servants residing in the "City of Ala shiya" (Baurain 1984: 231).12 To my knowledge, ashlar-built tombs on Cyprus have been discovered so far only at Enkomi.13 How ever, the popularity of secular and sacred architecture of ashlar masonry in various LC IIC sites throughout the island justifies Cadogan's question (1989: 48), "What led to changing the face of Cyprus in such an ostentatious way?" The aim of the following section is to demonstrate that this change was initiated by a shift in the balance 12I am deeply indebted to Prof. Muhly for bringing this impor tant document to my attention. 13 Earlier subterranean vaulted tombs dating to the Middle Bronze Age were found at Alalakh, Kabri, and Megiddo (Kem pinski 1989: 195, fig. 42; Scheftelowitz and Gershuni 2002: 32 34). Those of Tell Dan, Aphek, and Mycenae (Tomb Rho) are Late Bronze Age variants of Near Eastern forerunners (Ben Dov 2002: 36-55, fig. 2:10, 12; previously Vermeule 1964: 125, pi. 16:C).</page><page sequence="13">2005 URBANISM ON LATE BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 13 Table 6.

Economic Factors The most prominent aspects of the Cypriot econ omy discussed in this section are metallurgy, agricul tural production, pottery manufacture, and trade. Metallurgy. There is no doubt that the develop ment of metallurgy on Cyprus was driven by the need to meet the increasing demand for copper in the Mediterranean basin. As a result, metallurgy became the raison d'?tre of many LC II sites (ranging from mining villages, rural sanctuary sites, and fortified settlements to urban centers) which gives us a cer tain, but still incomplete, idea of how the regional metallurgical network operated at that time (Stech 1982; Muhly 1996). It has been rightly argued that "the diversity of ecological zones with their appur tenant resources . . ., the wide distribution of copper ore" and the fact that "all parts of the island have been connected with the variety of metal sources" brought about the establishment of regional control of the Cypriot metal industry in the 13th century (Manning and de Mita 1997: 107). As far as harbor towns are concerned, there are indications that in order to take advantage of the prevailing winds, of ficial workshops at both Enkomi and Kition were installed in the northwestern edge of the town. The "Maison du Tr?sor des Bronzes" at Enkomi (fig. 3: A) was built in close proximity to the metallurgical in stallation ("Industrial Complex"). Nonetheless, the workshops attached to Temple 1 at Kition (fig. 4) on the north and west do not necessarily imply an intended overall divine protection for the Cypriot metal industry, as suggested by Knapp (1986). Given the data presented in tables 4 and 5, a different sce nario seems more likely (table 6). The hierarchy outlined in table 6 demonstrates that, regardless of their location, the secular ashlar buildings were of much higher status than the sacred ones (table 6: Grades 1, 2a, 2b vs. 3a, 3b, 5a, 5b). This implies that 13th-century traditional buildings of Jt-shaped type (table 4) were more prestigious than the foreign buildings of "Old Mediterranean" type (table 5). It seems to me that the hierarchic difference between the secular and religious edifices under dis cussion is due to ethnic affinities: the local elite oc cupied the secular official buildings of the former type, whereas West Semitic emigrants attended the sacred buildings of the latter type. It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the entire hierarchic complexity of LC IIC, but it should be noted that most of the sites involved in various stages of metal processing at that period shared a common practice of hoarding. This phe nomenon is best reflected in the "Maison du Tr?sor des Bronzes" and "Maison des Bronzes" at Enkomi (fig. 3:A, G).14 The masonry style of both buildings and the fashion in which they were integrated in the original Hippodamian layout of Enkomi resemble 14The hoard from the former includes scale-pan, weights, tools, weapons, and personal adornments. Found in the latter hoard were a round table, several vessels, and tools (Catling 1964: 155-56; 286-88).</page><page sequence="14">14 ORA NEGBI BASOR 337 much larger ashlar edifices, secular and sacred alike (fig. 3:B, C, F), exclusively dating to LC IIC (Negbi 1986: 102). At Kition, the workshops located in the "Sacred Area" (fig. 4) were mainly engaged in metal recycling (Karageorghis and Kassianidou 1999),15 but the issue of whether recycling and hoarding were due to metal shortage is still controversial. However, there is a growing consensus that, in most cases, hoarding was practiced at the end of LC IIC, just be fore the destruction and abandonment of many sites on the island, in the hope that the goods could be un covered when the situation improved (Knapp, Mu hly, andMuhly 1988).16 Agricultural Production. In urban and rural set tlements alike, metallurgy is occasionally coupled with agricultural activity (Muhly 1996: 45-46). The most prominent cases of this phenomenon are the LC IIC inland towns of Kalavasos-Ay/as Dhimitrios and Al&amp;ssa-Paliotaverna (table 2:6, 9). Both sites, located in fertile valleys between the Troodos and the coastal outlets of the Vasilikos and Kouris rivers (fig. 1), have yielded large storage facilities for sub stantial quantities of agricultural products. At Ayios Dhimitrios, two storerooms, the "Pithos Hall" and "Pithos Magazine," were uncovered in the western and northern wings of ashlar Building X (South 1992: 133-35, fig. 1; 1995: 192-93). The im pressive "Pithos Hall" yielded more than 50 pithoi of various sizes (Keswani 1992; fig. 5, Groups I?III), whereas in the "Pithos Magazine," space was avail able for 34 standing vessels of the same groups. Gas chromatography analyses of the pithoi show that a total of about 50,000 liters of olive oil could have been stored in Building X (Keswani 1992; Hadji savvas 1992: 24-25, 44). There are indications that 15 Evidence for recycling during the same period has also been noticed at Tel Nami on the coast of Israel (Artzy 1995: 25; Haupt mann, Maddin, and Prange 2002: 18). 16We may recall a hoard of lead-filled bronze weights from Building X at Kalavasos-Av/?s Dhimitrios (Courtois 1983); four hoards containing a large variety of items from domestic contents at Pylsi-Kokkinokremos (Karageorghis and Demas 1984: 20, 60 66, pis. 25-28); a series of bronze stands from the metal workshop of the rural sanctuary at Myrtou-Pighades (Taylor 1957: 20, fig. 12; Catling 1957: 88-89, fig. 340; Webb 1999: 53); "a huge quan tity of copper nodules ..." as well as "a small quantity of copper objects, some finished and other broken or in various stages of manufacture" from the metal workshop in the courtyard of the LC IIC sanctuary of Athienou (Dothan and Ben-Tor 1983: 139); and a foundry hoard from the mining village of Mathiatis (Catling 1964: 282-85), to mention only a few cases. the huge amount of oil stored in Building X origi nated in Building XI, another ashlar edifice located across the street, where remains of an olive press were found.17 Two large oil storerooms of the same date are also recorded from Al&amp;ssa-Paliotaverna. One is a large rectangular room installed in the north wing of a jt-shaped ashlar edifice (Building II), which roughly corresponds to the size of Building X at Ayios Dhimi trios (table 4: Grade 2a, 2b). The Alassa storeroom (still unpublished) has been described as containing two rows of pithoi that, like those of Ayios Dhimi trios, "were set on stone-slabs and in circular floor depressions" (Hadjisavvas 1996b: 128-30 and pers. comm.). In the nearby Building I, there is a col umned hall (in which only a few column bases have been preserved) that closely resembles the "Pithos Hall" at Ayios Dhimitrios. Therefore, it appears that due to a lack of space in Building II, surplus olive oil was stored in Building I. The total amount of oil stored at Alassa-Paliotaverna has not yet been calcu lated, and its origin is still unknown. It is tempting to suggest, however, that associated with the two Palio taverna storerooms were pressing facilities located in the southern wing of Building II, presumably demolished by later, LC IIIA constructions (below, n. 35). Pilides (1996: 118) has noticed that large-capacity storerooms comparable to those of Ayios Dhimitrios have not been found in coastal urban centers which implies that "primary" and "secondary" urban centers "must have functioned differently." This assumption is not entirely incontestable. Suffice it to recall that at Maroni (table 4: line 3), facilities for the produc tion and storage of olive oil were also available in two adjacent buildings (the "Ashlar Building" and the "West Building") of Vournes (Cadogan 1989: fig. 4:2; Karageorghis 1990: fig. 3; Hadjisavvas 1992: 21, fig. 37). The lack of storage facilities at Enkomi and other major coastal emporia is difficult to explain, since despite the spacious storerooms found in the ashlar Jt-shaped edifices at Alassa and Ayios Dhimi trios (Buildings II and X, respectively), each of them is smaller than their counterparts at Enkomi (table 5: Grade 1 vs. 2a, 2b). Unfortunately, there are no dis tinctive remains to reveal the exact economic func 17Found in Building XI were pressing areas, crushing tools, fragmented pithoi mixed with olive stones, and a huge vat, prob ably used as a refining container for settling the oil's impurities be fore storing it (Hadjisavvas 1992: 24, figs. 42-43; 1996b: 131-32).</page><page sequence="15">2005 URBANISM ON LATE BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 15 tion of the official sector at Enkomi. Nonetheless, it seems logical that, like other "primary" urban cen ters, it was directly involved in external seaborne activity (mainly metal trade; see above), whereas "secondary" urban centers were mainly engaged in the internal responsibility of collection and distribution of substantial agricultural products: olive oil and flour. Hadjisavvas's exhaustive study Olive Oil Pro cessing in Cyprus (1992) refers to pressing accesso ries (both fixed and movable) from at least two other coastal towns, Enkomi and Hala Sultan Tekke (table 2:1, 4), although there are no indications of storage facilities at these sites.18 Taking into account that two identical Jt-shaped buildings were functioning at Enkomi in LC IIC (fig. 3:B, C) and that each of them is much larger than its Jt-shaped counterparts in other coastal and inland urban sites (table 6: Grade: 1 vs. 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 5a, 5b), Enkomi can be regarded as the most important urban site on Cyprus at that date.19 Archaeological remains for both production and storage of olive oil (presumably for ceremonial needs) were also discovered in the rural sanctuary sites of Myriou-Pighades and Athienou-Bamboulari (table 3:S2, S3).20 Keswani has argued (1993: 79) that the 18In fact, olive oil production at Maroni-Vournes dates back to LC IIB. Assigned to this period is a massive stone of the so-called Basin Building which was overlaid by the southwestern edge of the new, LC IIC "Ashlar Building" (Cadogan 1989: fig. 4.1; Hadji savvas 1992: fig. 19c). An LC IIC storeroom of undressed stones was also found in the lower town of Tsaroukkas (Manning and Monks 1998: 351). 19 In the case of Enkomi, pressing accessories have been dis covered in the "Maison aux Couteaux," a metal workshop located in the Artisans' Quarter 6W (Courtois, Lagarce, and Lagarce 1986: 22-23, fig. 2, pi. 5:2; Hadjisavvas 1992: 24, fig. 41). Those of Hala Sultan Tekke were discovered in House-Shrine C at the residential complex of Vizaja (Hadjisavvas 1992: 24, fig. 45). 20 The stratigraphy of Myrtou-Pighades indicates that the LC IIC (Period V) industrial installations also included an olive press located in the southeasternmost end (Rooms 26-27) of the sanctuary (Taylor 1957: fig. 3; Hadjisavvas 1992: 21, 23, fig. 38; Webb 1999: 51). At Athienou-Bamboulari, a series of rectangular compartments (the "Eastern Platform") containing 11 large pithoi indicate a storage complex (Wright 1992: 330, figs. 171, 172; Webb 1999: 22, fig. 3). The enigmatic metallurgical plant (the "Northeastern Platform") was assigned by the excavators to Floor II (Dothan and Ben-Tor 1983: 6-14, plan C). Based on metallur gical considerations, the validity of dating the storage complex and the metallurgical plant to the same period (LC IIIA) has been challenged by Maddin, Muhly, and Stech Wheeler (1983: 136-38). Their position, favoring a successive stratigraphie range from the LC IIC storage installation (Stratum III) to the LC IIIA metallur gical plant (Stratum II), seems to coincide with the archaeological data. Dothan and Misch-Brandl (1983: 113) have ascribed all the socioeconomic status of these sanctuaries resembles that of the inland urban centers, since "they would have served not only as transshipment points for semi-processed copper, but also as the loci for col lection of agricultural 'tribute.'" Nonetheless, the role of religion in legitimizing the political and eco nomic power of the ruling elites does not offer a clear-cut distinction between the status of urban tem ples and rural sanctuaries. Last but not least, inland villages, such as Apliki Karamallos, Politiko Phorades, and Analiondas Pali oklichia, located on the slopes of the Troodos (table 3:V1, V2, V3), may attest to close relationships be tween metal workshops and storage facilities. In the mining village of Apliki, olive oil (and presumably barley) stored in House A apparently supplied the basic needs of the local metalworkers (Webb and Frankel 1994: 16-17). This suggestion is best exem plified by the site of Analiondas which was described by Webb and Frankel (1994: 20-21) as "the first sound evidence for an agricultural support village . . . to neighboring mining villages, like" Mathiatis (fig. 1), "within a regionally based system of alliance and exchange." By the same token, it has lately been ar gued that the mining village of Phorades maintained "social and spatial relationships in the agricultural catchment area" of Politiko as early as the LC I (Knapp 2003: 576).21 Pottery Manufacture. There are indications that pottery making was another important economic pithoi found within the storage complex of Athienou and its im mediate vicinity (Locus 637A and Squares H-I/7) to Stratum II, because "no pithoi were found in Stratum III." This claim is in accurate because at least one pithos found in the courtyard (Lo cus 503) appears in the Loci List as belonging to Stratum III (Dothan and Misch-Brandl 1983: 113, 115, fig. 52:1). Also, at least two other pithoi attributed to Stratum III (Loci 518 and 524 in Squares H/8-9) were found in situ within the confines of the storage complex (e.g., Dothan and Ben-Tor 1983: plan D). Finally, the pithoi from the storage complex at Athienou share common features in both repertoire and layout with those of the LC IIC "Pithos Hall" at Kalavasos-Av?e&gt;s Dhimitrios, thus con firming the existence of a storage complex of the same period at Athienou as well. 21 Evidence for production and storage of cereal flour at Analiondas is provided by querns, various grinding and rubbing tools on the one hand, and numerous pithoi fragments on the other (Webb and Frankel 1994: 7-12, figs. 4, 6).

Keswani (1991: 97) has rightly argued that, in conjunction with the urban revolution of the ProBA, "the principal Late Cypriot ceramic wares display less diversity and regional variabilities than those of earlier periods . . ., a phenomenon which may be reflective not only of closer socio-political ties or interactions between dif ferent parts of the island, but also of the increasing centralization of pottery manufacture, with most ce ramics being produced in a few regional workshops." In fact, only three Late Cypriot pottery workshops have so far been recorded (fig. 1): at Toumba tou Skourou (table 2:12), Athienou-Bamboulari (table 3:S3), and Sanidha-M?Mta' (table 3:V5). Toumba tou Skourou, the only urban site in north west Cyprus, probably maintained maritime con nections, predominantly with Crete and the Aegean, since the initial phase of ProBA. Recovered from the upper town of this large site (the size of which is actually unknown due to severe destruction by mod ern plowing) were clay dumps, a series of smashed pots, and masses of sherds (Vermeule 1974: figs. 4, 5, 7; Vermeule and Wolsky 1990: 47-50, plan 1). These findings support the assertion that a potters' workshop (the "Basin Building") was functioning at the site from MC III/LC I until the close of LC IIC (Vermeule and Wolsky 1990: 28). There are indica tions that the town was considerably enlarged in the 14th-13th centuries, with the foundation of a resi dential quarter and a burial ground on the plateau at the foot of the acropolis. Of special interest is a "Pithos Room" of a large building ("Building B") located on the northern sector of the plateau, where pithoi of Plain White ware (hence PW), probably made in the "Basin Building," were displayed for sale (Vermeule 1974: figs. 2, 4, 6, 25, 26, 36; Ver meule and Wolsky 1990: 28, pi. 1). Pithoi of the same ware were in high demand as storage contain ers at sites such as Ayios Dhimitrios and Alassa Paliotaverna in the 13th century (see above). Production and storage of PW pithoi are also evi dent in the inland rural sanctuary site of Athienou, located en route from the eastern coast to the is land's hinterland. A huge quantity of pottery, includ ing about 2,000 intact vessels (ranging from miniature and small to medium- and large-sized ones), were heaped in the LC IIC t?menos sanctuary (Stratum III), and it has rightly been postulated that these vessels "could not have been intended for a mundane function," but have to be regarded as "votive vessels connected with a cult area" (Dothan and Ben-Tor 1983: 139). Additional data (such as heaps of clay, many vessels of the same form, as well as misfired and warped vessels) confirm the excavators' conten tion that "such a huge number of vessels were made at the site" (Dothan and Ben-Tor 1983: 139, e.g., pis. 12, 13, 19-32). Moreover, based on discover ies at Ayios Dhimitrios, Alassa-Paliotaverna, and Toumba tou Skourou, it can be assumed that PW pithoi of local manufacture were also used as stor age containers in the complex of the "eastern plat forms" at Athienou during the 13th century (see above, n. 20). Investigations in the upper Vasilikos Valley have raised the possibility that Sanidha Moutti (table 3:V5) is the first case of a Bronze Age potters' vil lage so far discovered on Cyprus. People acquainted with the rural landscape of the island today are well aware of the popularity of potters' villages in its hinterland (London 1991; Pilides 2000: 193). Given the proximity of Sanidha to clay deposits that are ideally suited to the manufacture of white wares, it has been suggested that in addition to White Slip bowls and craters, PW pithoi were also made at the site in the 13th century. Moreover, the large number of pithoi fragments collected on the surface (includ ing one bearing a Cypro-Minoan graffito) supports the assertion that the potters' village of Sanidha was supplying the demands for storage containers in Ay ios Dhimitrios, the only LC IIC urban center located in the lower Vasilikos Valley at that date (Keswani 1992: fig. 5; Todd and Pilides 1992). P?trographie analyses of 34 pithoi samples from various ProBA sites on the island (Pilides 2000: 110-12; Xenophontos, Pilides, and Malpas 2000) re veal that they were made of local clays but their spe cific provenances on the island were not indicated. Typologically, however, Keswani's three size group ings of pithoi (I?III) are all characterized by a band of parallel and undulating lines (either incised or ridged) around the body, which clearly attests to in fluence of Minoan Neopalatial storage jars (Keswani 1992: fig. 5; Christakis 1999; Buchholz 2000: figs. 5:c, e-g; 6:a-f). Furthermore, the stylistic similarity observable in the Cypriot PW pithoi repertory raises the question of whether the potters responsible for producing them were freelance experts or well-or ganized artisans commissioned by the ruling elite (Keswani 1991: 116). This question becomes even more complicated on account of the growing number of cases (about 90) of PW containers (predominantly pithoi) bearing impressed friezes made by cylinder seals of perish able material (mainly on their shoulders and occa</page><page sequence="17">2005 URBANISM ON LATE BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 17 Table 7.

Regarding pithoi impressed with seals probably made of perishable materials, it is noteworthy that in Sanctuary 1 at Kouklm-Palaepaphos (table 7:6), an almost intact impressed pithos found in situ can be safely dated to LC IIC. At other sites, only frag ments of impressed pithoi have been uncovered. A few originated in well-dated LC II contexts (table 7: 3, 4), whereas the locations of the remaining ones are inconclusive (table 7:1, 2, 5, 7), and therefore their date is usually based on stylistic affinities (Webb 1999: 118). The largest repertory of impressed friezes (about 50 fragments) has been found at Alassa (table 7:1); a preliminary study indicates that they were made by five different (nonextant) seals. Friezes made by two different seals are recorded from Kou rion and M&amp;a-Palaeokastro (table 7:2, 3),23 whereas 22 On the technique of rolling a cylindrical wooden seal over a strip of clay that was attached to the pithos's shoulders and/or handles while "leather hard," see Yogev 1983: 118; Porada 1988: 301; Webb 1992: 114-15. 23 Of special interest is one frieze from Maa (table 7:3) which was reassembled from 16 fragments found in different loci of the site (Porada 1988: 302, pi. E:l-3). At least two of the seal impres sions found at Kourion (Benson 1956: pis. 7, 8) do not appear on Cypriot pithoi but on imported Mycenaean vessels, and therefore they are not listed in table 7. the remaining sites have yielded a single impression each (table 7:4-7). The themes of the impressed pithoi derive mainly from the repertory of "Middle Pictorial" and "Ripe Pictorial" pottery vessels diagnostic to LC IIC/LC IIIA (Vermeule and Karageorghis 1982: 26-61). However, in contrast to their ceramic counterparts, the seal impressions are restricted to four pictorial themes: (a) charioteers chasing bulls; (b) pedestrians hunting lions and bulls; (c) men fighting animals be side an olive tree; and (d) an olive tree flanked by two pairs of goats. Impressions of the first theme (a) appear at most of the excavated sites (table 7:1-6), whereas one or two of the three other themes (b, c, d) are also recorded from Alassa, Kourion, Maa, and Enkomi (table 7:1-3, 7). The life span of themes (a) and (b), regarded as royal symbols, dates back to the art of the shaft graves at Mycenae (Vermeule 1975: 16, 21, 22, 26, 45, figs. 1, 3, 51, 57, 60). Most popu lar among them are scenes depicting chariots that seem to signify the dominance and power of the rul ing elite (Porada 1988: 302, tables A-B; Webb and Frankel 1994: fig. 5). Themes (c) and (d), with an olive tree depicted at the center, are found only in friezes from Alassa and Maa. Their meaning is open to speculation. The Alassa frieze might be related to the hunting theme (b) depicted on another seal im pression from the same site. The Maa frieze (table 7:3) recalls, in both composition and subject matter, the Near Eastern motif of a palm tree flanked by a pair of ibexes which prevailed in pictorial vase paint ing of the southern Levant from the mid-15th to the late 13th century (Amiran 1969: 161-62, pi. 50:4-9).</page><page sequence="18">18 ORANEGBI BASOR 337 However, it is still unknown whether the Cypriot friezes under discussion specify the potter's work shop where they were made, or the origin of the ol ive oil they contained (other explanations are also possible). Pilides, in her comprehensive study Pithoi of the Late Bronze Age in Cyprus, has pointed out (2000: 108-9) that the phenomenon of impressed pithoi cannot be explained without taking into account that a large number of them have Cypro-Minoan char acters incised on their rims and handles (predomi nantly, after being fired). She argues that, with a few exceptions, inscribed characters "may be nothing more than potter's marks,"24 whereas seal impres sions served as labels for the contents of the large (Group III) pithoi deposited in storage installations (see above). Webb has argued (2002: 139) that "seals may have been powerful mechanisms of organiza tional and ideological control in the dispersed re gional systems that characterize Keswani's multiple autonomous polities." In any event, the socioeco nomic role of the seal-impressed pithoi in general, and those found on Cyprus in particular, requires a thorough study (Webb and Frankel 1994: 17-20). By the same token, scholars are still wondering why impressed pithoi have not been recorded, thus far, from the large storerooms in Building X ("Pithos Hall" and "Pithos Magazine") at Ayios Dhimitrios. Cypro-Minoan inscriptions engraved on five clay cylinders found in Building X (Todd and South 1992: 195; South 1992; Keswani 1992: fig. 5; Smith 2002: 20-21, fig. 5) "probably contain administrative rec ords, possibly counts of commodities, possibly some thing related to the production and storage of olive oil" (Smith 2002: 25). It is hoped that these inscrip tions, when deciphered, may contribute toward a bet ter understanding of the status of Ayios Dhimitrios in LC IIC. Recent analyses of these cylinders (and sev eral Base Ring II vessels found at the same site) in dicate that they are petrographically related to the geological formation confined to the southern and southeastern margins of the Troodos (Goren et al. 2003: 240-45; 2004: 54-55). Furthermore, given the 24Although Cypro-Minoan signs and potters' marks frequently appear on Cypriot vessels found overseas (Hirschfeld 1993: 312? 15; Hulin 2002: 17, fig. 8.2), no seal-impressed pithoi of Cypriot workmanship have been recorded, as far as I know, outside Cy prus. This might indicate that these vessels had a regional and/ or interregional economic function within the island (Pilides 2002: 109). close proximity of Ayios Dhimitrios to the Troodos clay deposits, it is highly probable that the clay cyl inders (and the pottery vessels) were made at that very site (see below, table 10). Trade. It is generally believed that trade played a most important role in the Cypriot economy during the Late Bronze Age (Muhly 1982; 1996; Kara georghis 1990; Cline 1994; Knapp 1997a). The ex tent and nature of the island's maritime activities in this period are reflected in both the literary and ar chaeological evidence. Nonetheless, as Muhly (1982: 251) has rightly stated, "we must look at each body of evidence in turn, as it pertains to Cyprus and the position of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean." Literary evidence, consisting of the following documents, deserves several comments here: 1. The El-Amarna letters (mid-14th century) refer to the construction of ships in Alashiya (Muhly 1982: 251) and royal shipments from Alashiya to Egypt (Baurain 1984: 194-98). Included in these shipments was a large variety of items?predom inantly copper, wood, and different kinds of oil (Baurain 1984: 223-24). Given the formula used by the El-Amarna letters addressed to "the King of Alashiya," it appears that he was regarded by the 14th-century pharaohs as an independent mon arch, equal in status to the heads of several Near Eastern states (Baurain 1984: 204-6). 2. The Ras Shamra Archives (13th century) occasion ally mention maritime activities of Alashiyan trad ers in the emporium of Ugarit and other harbor towns along the Syro-Cilician littoral (Baurain 1984: 224-32). 3. Hittite texts reveal that, during the era of "Pax Hethitica," which followed the peace treaty be tween Hatti and Egypt (in the early 13th century), Alashiya (like Ugarit) became a Hittite vassal (Singer 1999: 646-50). 4. Hittite and Ugaritic documents dating to the sec ond half of the 13th century describe the unstable and deteriorating situation (drought and famine coupled with movements of peoples) in the north eastern Mediterranean prior to the final collapse of Ugarit and Hattusa at the turn of the same cen tury (Yon 1992; Singer 1983; 1999: 704-31; 2000: 22, 26-28).

Shipwreck cargoes include Cypriot oxhide ingots carried on board the Cape Gelidoniya and Uluburun ships (henceforth CG and UB) that sank off the southwestern coast of Turkey en route from the Levant and Cyprus to the Aegean ca. 1200 and 1300 b.c.e., respectively (fig. 5:1, 2). Since both wrecks (among a few others) have been thoroughly discussed elsewhere (Bass et al. 1989; Bass 1991; Cline 1994: 100-105, maps 1, 4; and, more recently, Pulak 2001; Hadjisavvas 2003b: 100), there is no need to dwell on them here. However, a third wreck, roughly contemporaneous with that of CG and discovered off Point Iria (henceforth PI) in the Gulf of Argos (fig. 5:3), deserves a more detailed discussion, as it is the only Late Bronze Age vessel so far recorded from Greek waters (Lolos 1999; 2003: 102-4). Regarded by the excavator as the wreckage of a Cypro-Mycenaean cargo ship, it presumably sank en route from Cyprus, via ports of call on Crete, to harbor towns in the Argolid, such as Nauplion, Asine, and Tiryns (or vice versa). The CG and UB ships were carrying an impressive quantity of copper and tin ingots, bronze artifacts, and scrap metal (Pu lak 2001: 18-23; Hauptmann, Maddin, and Prange 2002). The UB ship, which also yielded an excep tional variety of materials and artifacts (including pottery and items of exotic origin), is justly regarded as the best case-study of a Syrian trading vessel, which was taking the circular east Mediterranean route be tween the Levant and the Aegean at the closing years of the 18th Dynasty. The corpus of items recovered from CG, apart from ingots and scrap metal, seems to reflect a change in both the extent and nature of east Mediterranean trade during the late 19th Dy nasty (Cline 1994: 100-102). On the PI ship, "ce ramic vessels seem to have formed the main bulk or a large part of the cargo, but probably not the whole</page><page sequence="20">20 ORA NEGBI BASOR 337 Table 8.

Nonetheless, a comparison between the pottery assemblages of the UB and PI ships is expected to shed new light on the late 13th century Mediterranean trade as opposed to that of the late 14th (table 8). Table 8 shows that two types of large pottery con tainers, Levantine amphorae and Cypriot pithoi, were carried on board the UB vessel, whereas only Cypriot pithoi were found in the PI wreck (Pulak 2001: 40 41, fig. 2; Lolos 1999: 44, fig. 1; 2002: 102, fig. 3). Morphologically speaking, these two types of porta ble containers were especially made to suit terrestrial and maritime transportation.25 Quantitative data seem to indicate that the home ports of the UB and PI ships correlate with the predominant type of transport con tainers they carried and the approximate origin of their cargo. As shown in table 8, Levantine amphorae over whelmingly outnumber the Cypriot pithoi in the UB wreck (150 vs. 10), while four Cypriot pithoi were the only containers recovered from the PI ship. In the case of UB, examination of the vessels' contents re veals that almost all the Levantine pithoi were filled with terebinth resin, a natural substance obtained from the eastern Mediterranean Pistacia atl?ntica tree. 25The former were "commercial jars" that evolved from domes tic amphorae (the so-called Canaanite jars), originally used for storing agricultural products (mainly oil and wine) since the mid 15th to the late 14th century (Amiran 1969: 140-42, pi. 43:1-8). Commercial amphorae, especially those originating in the northern Levant (best exemplified by those deposited in the harbor ware house at Minet el-Beida) have angular shoulders and pointed bases which provide them with enough stability to endure overseas voy ages (Negbi and Negbi 1993: 321-22). The Cypriot pithoi became a new component in the ceramic repertoire of the island since the late 14th to the late 13th century (Pilides 2000: 109-10), probably as local substitutes for the Levantine amphorae. The largest Cyp riot pithoi (Keswani's Group III) were used only for storage, as best represented in the "Pithos Hall" of Building X at Kalavasos Ayios Dhimitrios (Keswani 1992: fig. 5), whereas the standard medium-sized type (Keswani's Group II) "that were less cumber some in transportation, may have been made specially for export" (Pilides 1996: 112, 117). The exceptional quantity of P. atl?ntica resin (about a ton) carried in the UB containers (Pulak 2001: 33 36) probably corresponds to its multifunctional qual ities in antiquity (Negbi and Negbi 1993: 322-25), while one Levantine amphora which contained some 350 kg of glass ingots?rare artifacts of Egyptian workmanship?could have been bartered for the resin which was in high demand in Egypt. Of the 10 UB Cypriot pithoi, only a large-size one (Pulak 2001: 40, fig. 2) is of special interest, because it contained a cargo of 18 newly made Cypriot vessels, including 4 oil lamps and 14 pieces of a tableware set (Pulak 2001: 41, fig. 3) ready for sale. In the case of PI, the contents of the few Cypriot pithoi recovered is un known, as all were found empty (Pilides 1996: 118; Lolos 1999: 43, fig. 1). However, at least 17 out of a total of the 25 small-sized vessels found on board, including 8 LM IIIB stirrup jars and 9 LH IIIB am phoroid jars, have been regarded by Lolos (1999:44 45, figs. 4, 5) as the actual cargo of the ship.26 It is therefore tempting to postulate that, unlike the Cyp riot pottery vessels from the UB ship, the Minoan and Mycenaean vessels recorded from the PI ship were not valued for their attractive appearance, but rather for their contents. Suffice it to recall archaeo logical and literary evidence that attests to specific types of Levantine, Cypriot, and Creto-Mycenaean vessels whose shapes were designed to contain a large variety of precious products (drugs, scented oils, oint ments, and condiments) that were widely circulated in Late Bronze Age Mediterranean markets.27 Terrestrial distribution of Cypriot items overseas provides a more comprehensive idea of the exter nal trading destinations of the island in the 14th 13th centuries (Pilides 2000: 48-53).

Ugarit has yielded the largest number of Cypriot pithoi compared with other sites. Eight diagnostic PW pithoi, ranging from small to medium-sized con tainers (80-140 cm in height), have been published by Schaeffer (1949: fig. 86:19, 21-23, 25, 27-29).28 Considering the proximity of Ugarit to the northeast ern coast of Cyprus, the large quantity of Cypriot pithoi recovered from Ras Shamra is not surprising since Minet el-Beida, the major harbor of Ugarit (Yon 1997b), was most probably the home port of the UB ship. A concentration of about 80 Levantine am phorae in the warehouse of Minet el-Beida (Schaef fer 1949: pi. 31:1; Negbi and Negbi 1993: 322) is in full accord with their overwhelming majority vs. Cypriot pithoi in the UB wreck (table 8), on the one hand, and the popularity of 14th-century Levantine amphorae in the Aegean (Cline 1994: 99, table 60), on the other. Excavations on Bates's Island have yielded scanty remains of a settlement, regarded by the excavator (White 2002: 35-84, plans 1-4) as a seasonal port of call for foreign traders en route to the Nile Delta and/or vice versa in the 14th century (presumably during the summer sailing months). Estimations of the size and nature of this settlement depend mainly on archaeological and ecological criteria. Based on the dispersal of Aegean, Cypriot, Canaanite, and Egyp tian pottery wares (Russell 2002; Hulin 2002), it has been demonstrated that the ceramic assemblage of the settlement, ranging from fine to coarse wares (mainly cooking pots and pithoi), is predominantly of Cyp riot workmanship. The number of Cypriot pithoi is difficult to estimate, because only small fragments of them were found. Of special interest are Cypro Minoan potters' marks incised after firing on sev 28Most of the Ugaritic pithoi were found in funerary deposits, whereas only one of them was discovered near the "Dagon Temple" (Schaeffer 1949: fig. 86:28), bringing to mind a pithos of the same type found in situ in the t?menos of the Kouklia-Palae paphos sanctuary (Buchholz 2000: figs. 5:f, g; 6:a-f). Sporadic occurrences of Cypriot pithoi are also recorded from LB contexts at several sites in Lebanon and northern Israel (Pilides 2000: 109 10). However, based on clay analyses, it has been argued that imitations of imported Cypriot pithoi were made in the southern Levant as late as the 12th-llth centuries (Gilboa 2001: 164-66). eral pithoi handles (see above, n. 24). Stratigraphie data reveal that the bulk of Cypriot pottery fragments originated in well-dated 14th-century contexts, thus slightly predating those of the UB shipwreck (see above). It has been suggested by Hulin and White (2002: 174) that "traders who took advantage of the facilities and opportunities afforded by Bates's Is land, may have been bent on grand missions as state emissaries." By the same token, they have also ar gued that the archaeological remains from this site "can by the nature of things, leave no record of the main purpose of the voyagers" (Hulin and White 2002: 174). Consequently, the prevalence of Cypriot wares over other wares of foreign workmanship roughly corresponds to the cargo of the PI shipwreck (see above). By contrast, the picture that emerges from the remains of Bates's Island in general, and those retrieved from the surface layer in particular, may well represent "a lingering trade being con ducted against a background of increasing economic activity by small groups of people filling the gap of the general economic collapse at the end of the 13th century" (Hulin and White 2002: 174). Regrettably, however, the Marsa Matruh final report (White 2002) does not add an updated discussion to that of the preliminary ones (White 1986; 1989). Nonethe less, White's latest publication (2003) on the isolated trading post of Bates's Island in the 14th-13th centu ries, where Cypriot mariners were probably exchang ing their attractive goods for exotic items (such as ostrich eggs) brought by local nomads of the Libyan desert, reminds one of Herodotus's accounts (Book 4: 196) describing how bargaining between the Cartha ginians and the Libyans took place in the fifth cen tury B.C.E. Excavations at Kommos have yielded important data on this harbor town during the Late Minoan period (Shaw and Shaw 1993). Ceramic studies (Watrous 1992: 178-83, fig. 8; Cline 1994: table 58) show that Cypriot pithoi recovered in well-stratified LM IIIA deposits are overwhelmingly outnumbered by Syro-Palestinian amphorae.29 Furthermore, central 29The total number of Levantine amphorae in LM IIIA Kom mos listed by Cline (1994: 99; table 60) is inaccurate, because it is larger than that presented by Watrous (1992: fig. 8). However, the popularity of these amphorae in LH IIIA is in full accord with the Kom el-Hetan itinerary, which apparently represents a genuine list of a royal Egyptian visit to major Mycenaean strongholds in the P?loponn?se (such as Nauplia and Tiryns) via several ports of call on Crete, among which at least Khania and Amnisos are safely identifiable (Cline 1994: 21-42).</page><page sequence="22">22 ORA NEGBI BASOR 337 Mediterranean pottery vessels, predominantly of Ital ian "Impasto Ware" and Sardinian "Nuraghic Ware," which first appeared at Kommos in LM IIIA, reached an unprecedented peak of 23 in LM IIIB vs. only 10 in LM IIIA deposits (Watrous 1992: 178-83, fig. 9), thus attesting to the leading role of 13th-century Kommos as a gateway for east-west trade routes in the Mediterranean. Of special interest are fragments of Cypriot pithoi discovered at Cannatello on Sicily and Antigori on Sardinia (Vagnetti 2001: 8ID, fig. 2:4, 5). Pithoi of the same type carried on board the PI ship indicate that these distinctive LC IIC trans port containers presumably arrived at the two larg est islands of the Tyrrhenian Sea, via Kommos, in the 13th century (Lo Schiavo 2001: 133-34; 2003: 17-18). Cline (1994: 61) has argued that "LH/LM IIIB represents the largest influx of Cypriot objects into Mainland Greece." This implies that, contrary to Egyptian and Palestinian imports, items of Cypriot origin did not peak in LH/LM IIIA but rather in LH/ LM IIIB, when Egypto-Levantine interactions with the Aegean had markedly decreased. Simultaneously, however, Cypriot imports to the Aegean became popular in LH/LM IIIB at the expense of the Levan tine vessels. Moreover, there are indications that at that date Mycenaean imports to the Levant were al most totally replaced by Cypriot substitutes. This diachronic phenomenon, which clearly attests to the geopolitical changes that were taking place in the eastern Mediterranean during the era of "Pax Hethi tica," may support Cline's scenario (1991) postulat ing a Hittite ban on the entry of Mycenaean ships to harbor towns of its Syrian vassal states in the second half of the 13th century. This development also ini tiated the shift of traditional Mycenaean attention from the east to new targets in the central Mediter ranean (Cline 1994: 106-9). Cline's scenario, which corresponds to the mari time and terrestrial archaeological discoveries, is further illuminated by the copper oxhide ingots, comparable to those carried by the UB and CG ships, found in the central Mediterranean (fig. 5). A few ingots of this type have been recorded from pen insular Italy and the Lipari Islands, but many more appear in Nuraghic settlements all over Sardinia (Stos-Gale and Gale 1992: 321, fig. 1; Lo Schiavo 2001: 138-39, fig. 3). The date of these ingots is problematic because the life span of the Nuraghic period was comparatively long (ranging approxi mately from the 13th to the 9th century). Nonetheless, there is a growing consensus, based on several re liable contexts, that these ingots (occasionally bear ing Cypro-Minoan signs) date to the 13th century (Sardinian "Recent Bronze Age"), and therefore cor respond to LC IIC = LM/LH IIIB (Lo Schiavo 2001: 134-37).30 The main controversial issue concerning us here is the source of the copper used for producing these ingots (Maddin and Merkel 1990; Muhly and Stech 1990). Lead isotope analyses have shown that 95 percent of the ingots analyzed are consistent in com position with Cypriot copper ore, which implies that most of the oxhide ingots found on Sardinia origi nated on Cyprus (Gale and Stos-Gale 1985; Stos Gale, Gale, and Zwicker 1986; Stos-Gale and Gale 1992). However, Muhly (1991: 189) has already asked, "is it realistic to think in terms of Cypriot cop per being imported by a central Mediterranean island with its own rich deposits of copper ore?" This very question has also been raised by Kassianidou (2001: 110) who argued (like Muhly) in a paper entitled "Cypriot Copper in Sardinia: Another Case of Bring ing Coals to Newcastle?" that "Cypriot smiths and copper traders traveled west in a search for new sources of precious metals." If this is really the case, it may imply that Cypriots arriving at Sardinia ex changed Cypriot copper for Sardinian tin and iron as early as the 13th century b.c.e. THE AFTERMATH The catastrophes that afflicted the eastern Medi terranean basin ca. 1200 b.c.e. brought about a col lapse of the political and economic structure that had prevailed in the Aegean, Anatolia, the Levant, and Cyprus prior to that date (Liverani 1987; Rutter 1992; Tainter 1988: 193-214; Falconer 1994; Knapp 1994; Drews 1995: 33-90; Small 1998). The nature of the following period on Cyprus (LC IIIA), which spanned about a century (table 1), is a matter of controversy, since there is an ongoing debate as to 30 This date is supported by indirect ceramic synchronism be tween a group of diagnostic LC IIC vessels and a Sardinian Gray Ware bowl assigned to the early Nuraghic period found in LM IIIB context at Kommos (Watrous 1992: figs. 8, 9; Lo Schiavo 2001: 137). Several other cases in which Cypriot oxhide ingots and LC IIC pottery were discovered in early Nuraghic contexts on Sardinia (Muhly and Stech 1990: 203-7; Stos-Gale and Gale 1992) confirm this synchronism.</page><page sequence="23">2005 URBANISM ON LATE BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 23 Table 9.

Mycenaean cultural koine c. Urban and demographic crisis f. Introduction of iron technology whether LC IIIA was a regressive or innovative pe riod compared with LC IIC (table 9:A, B). Regression Scholars maintaining the first option regard cer tain features of LC IIIA as evidence for regression (table 9:A, a-c). These include deterioration in town planning and in construction quality, both common features of the reoccupation of coastal emporia like Enkomi and Kition that were reinforced by massive fortifications. Drastic changes also took place within the walls of both towns in LC IIIA. At Enkomi, the original Hippodamian layout of the LC IIC town was disrupted, and the well-planned complexes of mon umental buildings lying along the angular streets dis integrated (Negbi 1986: 102-5). The twin secular buildings located in the administrative quarter were severely damaged in LC IIIA, as the doors and win dows of the ashlar fa?ade of "B?timent 18" facing the Fifth Avenue (fig. 3:C) were blocked by rubble (Courtois, Lagarce, and Lagarce 1986: 18-32; Negbi 1986: pi. 24, 1), and its inner space was subdivided into small, poorly constructed units. The adjacent edifice (fig. 3:B) was turned into a sacred building (the so-called Sanctuary of the Horned God), reusing some of the ashlar stones of its LC IIC predecessor (Karageorghis 1983: ill. 107; Negbi 1986: pi. 24:2).31 Drastic changes also took place at the end of LC IIC in the Artisans' Quarter, with the abandonment of the "B?timent ? la Colonne" (fig. 3:F) and the re building of the "Sanctuary of the Ingot God" (fig. 3:E) which became the only sacred edifice func tioning in the eastern sector of Enkomi after 1200 B.c.E. In a recent study of the architectural sequence of this sanctuary, Webb (2001: 70-73, figs. 1-3) has demonstrated that the LC IIIA sanctuary was larger, 31 The "Sanctuary of the Horned God" (fig. 3:B) is a mega roid hall that occupied the courtyard of the original local type of 7r-shaped building. and its layout and orientation different from those of its LC IIC forerunner (see table 5).32 R??valuation of the northern sector at Kition (fig. 4) has revealed that the new pair of LC IIIA temples (4, 5), added to the preexisting LC IIC pair (1, 2), is located beyond the temenoi (A, B) of the original "Sacred Area" (above, n. 9). The new fashion of reusing stone anchors as pseudo-orthostates within all the temples of Kition (Webb 1999: 94, fig. 32) brings to mind a common practice among Levantine mariners to offer votive anchors to deities worshipped in the Bronze Age temples of Byblos and Ugarit (Frost 1985). There fore, it seems likely that the Kition anchors could have been brought to the Bay of Larnaca by new comers from the Levant ca. 1200 b.c.e.33 Urban and demographic crisis (table 9:A) is evi denced by a change in the material culture remains, which reveal that, compared to LC IIC, a larger num ber of people occupied a smaller number of sites in LC IIIA. This demographic density, presumably resulting from the destruction and abandonment of many set tlements and population movements throughout the Mediterranean, is detected on Cyprus mainly at the coastal urban sites of Kition and Enkomi. At Kition, the new pair of poorly built temples (4,5) offered cult facilities to more worshippers from Lebanon. At En komi, the external blockage and internal subdivision of "B?timent 18" into small spatial units was probably aimed at providing shelter for refugees from the north ern coast of Syria. Traces of the same phenomenon 32The issue of whether the original LC IIC sanctuary was built in ashlar or undressed stones is inconclusive (above, table 5), since it was presumably disrupted by the rebuilding of its LC IIIA successor. 33 By the same token, it has been argued that the types of ships engraved on the southern fa?ade of Temple 1 at Kition, an altar from Akko, and a rock pass along the Carmel Ridge attest to the intrusive Sea Peoples' arrival to southeastern Cyprus and northern Israel at approximately the same date (Artzy 1998; Wachsmann 2000: 135-37; Karageorghis 2000: 261-63, fig. 13.11).</page><page sequence="24">24 ORA NEGBI BASOR 337 are observed in the Cypriot countryside (fig. 1). Sinda, an LC IIC fortified settlement (table 3:F3) dominat ing the trading routes between the Bay of Famagusta and the Mesaoria Plain, was refortified in LC IIIA, and a new stronghold was simultaneously founded on the hill of Idalion-Ambelleri (table 3:F4) overlook ing the Ayios Sozomenos Plateau. Topographic con siderations may indicate that the purpose of both sites was to offer shelter to displaced people from all over the island. In addition, there are indications that the growing demand for personal security, which had already started in the late 13th century, peaked on Cyprus and other east Mediterranean territories in the 12th.34 Innovation Scholars supporting the second option?that the LCIILA was a period of innovation?regard certain other elements as indicators for this position (table 8:B, d-f): Aegean constructional elements, including hearth rooms and bathrooms, provide reliable evidence for Mycenaean and Minoan presence on the island in LC IIIA (Karageorghis 2000: 268-74).35 The most dis tinctive Mycenaean feature is the megaroid hall of the "Sanctuary of the Horned God" at Enkomi (fig. 3:B). However, the hall of this sanctuary, with its off-center hearth and benches along the walls, has neither the canonic shape nor the function of a gen uine Aegeo-Anatolian megaron (Werner 1993: 129; Webb 1999: 91-92). Of special interest is a built-in ashlar bathroom installed in an LC IIC residential complex of Area 8 (Building A) at Hala Sultan Tekke, which recalls the so-called Minoan Lustral Basins of Neopalatial Crete (?str?m 1989: 14, fig. 3; Karageorghis 2000: 272). More popular in LC IIIA are the "Horns of Consecration" (Rutkowski 1986: 78, 84; 101-9, figs. 79, 94, 95, 135, 145). Cypriot versions of this distinctive Minoan cult sym bol mostly display the horns on top of ashlar-built 34For the same phenomenon, see Rutter 1992; Caubet 1992: 129-30; Astr?m 1998; Karageorghis 2000: 261-62; and Kanta 2001. 35 In the case of Alassa-Paliotaverna, a hearth and a bathtub were installed in the reoccupied southern wing of Ashlar Building II (Hadjisavvas 1994: pi. 14, 3; 1996a: 30-32, fig. 8; Karageorghis 1998: 279, fig. 3; Webb 1999: 125, fig. 52), where production and storage of olive oil supposedly took place in the 13th century. A pot tery tub was recovered from Sanctuary 1 at Kouklia-Palaepaphos (Maier and Karageorghis 1984: 96, fig. 78), while hearths were found in several habitations at Enkomi and in two buildings at Maa Palaeokastro in the 12th (Karageorghis 1998: 278-79, figs. 1, 2). platforms or altars of different sizes that were in stalled in the temenoi of indigenous rural sanctuar ies (Myrtou-Pighades) and Levantine urban temples (at Kition and Kouklm-Palaepaphos). Given the con texts in which these sacred installations were found (Webb 1999: 176-79, figs. 66, 67; Karageorghis 2000: 261, fig. 13.8), it may be assumed that there was a sort of tolerance between the locals and for eigners attending the rural and urban cult places on Cyprus at that date. Mycenaean cultural koine is primarily evident in the shape, decoration, and technique of the Myce naeanized pottery made of local clays (namely Myc IIIC:lb). The new predominantly wheelmade ce ramic repertory (including fine tableware and coarse kitchen ware), alien to the Cypriot ceramic tradition, points to foreign culinary habits (Bunimovitz and Yasur-Landau 1996). Therefore, the idea of assign ing this repertory to a distinctive ethnic group of "Sea Peoples" (Greek Achaeans/Hittite Ahhiyawa) who had settled on Cyprus and in the Levant ca. 1200 B.c.E., is generally accepted (Astr?m 1998: 82-83; Kling 2000; Karageorghis 2000: 256-57: fig. 13.2).36This does not necessarily imply that the for eign-style pottery assemblages (from both Cyprus and the Levant) were made of local clays by Myce naean potters for Mycenaean clientele who wished to use their traditional repertory of cooking and din ing vessels abroad. Alternatively, it is possible that local potters (Cypriot and Levantine, respectively) were producing imitations of the same repertory to satisfy the demand of foreign and local elites. By the same token, production of other desirable Myce naean items, including clay bathtubs and terracotta figurines (Karageorghis 2000: 258-59) found in pub lic and private LC IIIA contexts, can be similarly interpreted. The introduction of iron is generally considered the most prominent innovation of the 12th century (Snodgrass 1971; 1980; Wertime 1980; Waldbaum 1982; Muhly 1980; 1992). Archaeological and metal lurgical data indicate that Cyprus was the first terri tory in the eastern Mediterranean to develop iron technology (Snodgrass 1982; Maddin 1982; Kara georghis 2000: 260). There is no consensus, how 36Actually, this issue is not settled, because there is no con clusive chronological data as to whether the production of Myc IIIC:Ib ware on Cyprus and in the southern Levant had already started before the end of LC IIC, or only with the beginning of LC IIIA (Hadjisavvas 1991; Sherratt 1991; 1998; ?str?m 1998: 82-84; Karageorghis 2000; 256-57, fig. 13.1; Kling 2000; and most recently Dothan and Zukerman 2004).</page><page sequence="25">2005 URBANISM ON LATE BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 25 ever, as to the validity of Snodgrass's hypothesis (1971: 237-38; 1982: 293) that a shortage of tin around 1200 forced the Cypriot bronze workers to find a substitute by exploiting iron.37 On the con trary, there are indications that the LC II bronze working tradition did not come to an end with the introduction of iron, but continued well into LC III. The availability of two different metallurgical pyro technologies (Wertime 1982: 358-60) is evident in two main categories of objects produced on the island in the 12th century: utilitarian iron tools and weapons on the one hand, and ceremonial bronze paraphernalia on the other. Products of the first cate gory (knives, daggers, and swords)38 replaced pre LC IIIA bronze forerunners. Those of the second category (cult statuettes and stands of wine-mixing kraters) continued the local bronzeworking heritage of the 14th?13th centuries. Nonetheless, since Cat ling's seminal study, Cypriot Bronzework in the Mycenaean World (1964), there has been a growing tendency to overestimate the extent of the "Sea Peo ples'" impact on the repertory of bronze artifacts from Cyprus and the Levant in the 12th century (e.g., Karageorghis 2000: 260; Tubb 2000 vs. Negbi 1991; 1998). Within Cyprus, Enkomi is still the best test-case for comparing the bronze repertory of LC IIIA with that of LC IIC. It is suggested here that during the later period, activity of freelance metalsmiths grew considerably at the expense of the centralized work shops located in the administrative, northwest sector of the town (fig. 3). Following the collapse of the economic structure ca. 1200, the important role of this sector with its "Industrial Complex" and a series of ashlar buildings (fig. 3:A-C) came to an end. However, at least two residential workshops ("Mai son aux Couteaux" and "Maison de l'Armurier") lo cated in the center of the town (Quartiers 6W, 5E) continued to function during LC III. Contextual and spatial considerations may also suggest that some 37 It has been postulated that lack of fuel, due to deforestation of the Troodos, was the main reason for the replacement of bronze by iron pyrotechnology ca. 1200 b.c.e. (Wertime 1982: 357-60), but the metal crisis hypothesis has been rejected by Muhly (1992: 17-18). 38Iron objects were gradually developed from the production of knives in LC IIIA to include daggers, swords, and occasionally bi metallic (namely, bronze-riveted iron blades) tools and weapons in LC IIIB (Snodgrass 1980; 1981; 1982; 1994: 167-68; Waldbaum 1982; Sherratt 1994: 59-60; Karageorghis 2000: 257; Matth?us 2001: 177-78). bronze masterpieces, including anthropomorphic statuettes and ceremonial stands, could have origi nated in these workshops. Statuettes of the so-called Ingot and Horned Gods are among the most outstanding artifacts of ProBA Cyprus, but their chronology is highly dis puted. Therefore, a "new reading" of their stratigra phy, presented by Webb (2001: 77-80), deserves brief discussion here. First, I fully accept her conclu sion that the deposition (hoarding) of both statuettes coincides with the final abandonment of Enkomi. This crucial event is directly related to the founda tion of a new town at Salamis, which replaced the old town of Enkomi and became the only emporium in the Bay of Famagusta in LC IIIB (table 3:1, 2). Sec ond, I tend to agree with her that the life span of the "Sanctuary of the Ingot God" was longer than that of the "Horned God" (see above). Third, there are stylistic and contextual considerations in favor of the view that both statuettes were products of LC IIIA workshops. The iconography of the "Ingot God" statuette39 is perplexing because it combines the image of a Cyp riot metal deity (standing on an oxhide ingot)40 with the stance of the Syro-Palestinian "Smiting God" (Seeden 1980: 102-23, Groups X, XI). Its military attributes, including Mycenaean greaves, a round Hittite shield, and a specific type of horned headgear, are diagnostic of Sherden mercenaries participating in the battle of Qadesh on the Orontes, and the Sea Battle in the Nile Delta, as depicted in Egyptian wall paintings dating to the late 13th and early 12th cen turies (Sandars 1985: 107,109,125,160-61, figs. 66, 67, 79, 112).41 In this respect the Cypriot statuette of the "Ingot God" is closely related to bronze figu rines of Sardinian warriors dating to the early first 39Courtois 1971: 151-66, figs. 1, 2; Schaeffer 1971: 506-10, figs. 1-4, pis. 1-7; Negbi 1976: 38-39, no. 1405, fig. 51; Seeden 1980: 123, no. 1794, pi. 112; Sandars 1985: 107, 109, 125, 160, 161, frontispiece and pi. VIII; Courtois, Lagarce, and Lagarce 1986: 32-36, pi. 18:4; Webb 1999: 223-26, fig. 72:2. 40Two bronze female figurines of unknown provenance on Cy prus, with the decisive Cypriot features of a fertility goddess, are standing, likewise, on ingot-shaped bases (Webb 1999: 232-35, fig. 80:1, 2). The symbolic significance of this specific type of ingot (Knapp 1986) is supported, inter alia, by a series of votive ingots (most of them bearing Cypro-Minoan signs) from Enkomi (Catling 1964: 268, pi. 49:h; O. Masson 1971: figs. 1-4; Courtois, Lagarce, and Lagarce 1986: 67, pi. 18:11, 12) and ceremonial scenes of ingot bearers depicted on LC IIIA panels of four side stands (Catling 1964: 205-6, pi. 34:a-c; 1984: 82-83, pis. 12, 13; Karageorghis 1983: 214-15, photo 184).</page><page sequence="26">26 ORA NEGBI BASOR 337 millennium (Sandars 1985: figs. 129, 130). As such, the Cypriot statuette and its Sardinian derivatives add credence to the growing consensus that the Sherden did not migrate from Sardinia to the eastern Mediterranean, but vice versa (Sandars 1985: 198? 200; Singer 1988). The unique statuette of the "Horned God," the largest of its kind (almost 55 cm in height) so far re corded from ProBA Cyprus, still attracts attention today, more than half a century after its discovery.42 This muscular, short-kilted youth standing in a ges ture of blessing testifies to the mixed inspirations of Syrian, Anatolian, Minoan, and Mycenaean plastic art spanning the period from the Late Bronze Age to the Archaic period.43 Nonetheless, the unique woolen horned headgear of the Enkomi god probably personifies a local shepherd deity, whose cult statu ette is to be regarded as a Cypro-Aegean master piece. The artistic superiority of the "Horned God" over that of the "Ingot God" indicates that they originated in two different workshops. The latter statuette was probably made in the "Maison de l'Armurier" located near the sanctuary bearing his epithet (fig. 3:E); the location of the workshop where the former statu ette was made is unknown.44 Unfortunately, the iden 41 Of special interest is the representation of a warrior on a clay bowl from Bogazk?y, dating to ca. 1400 b.c.e.

By the same token, there is no evidence for the workshop where at least five "ordinary" Levantine figurines of smiting and enthroned males from Enkomi were produced. The former two were discovered near the "Sanctuary of the Horned God" (Seeden 1980: 122-23, nos. 1793, 1795, pi. Ill), and the remaining three came from the upper debris of "B?timent 18" (Negbi 1976:55-57, nos. 1480,1481,1482: figs. 65, 66). tity of the deities portrayed in both statuettes is a matter of speculation. However, there seems to be a clear correspondence between the "ethnicity" of each deity and the type of sanctuary in which his cult was practiced. The "Ingot God" was worshipped in a distinctive Syro-Palestinian temple, and the "Horned God" in a pseudo Mycenaean megaron. Consequently, the ethnic affiliations of both deities and their cult places may reflect the demographic complexity of the island during the 12th century B.C.E. Stands of wine-mixing kraters are among the most prestigious artifacts of the royal banquets that ex panded from Egypt and Anatolia to the Levant and Cyprus in the 13th century. The remarkable techni cal quality of four side stands in general and rod tri pod stands in particular led Catling, some 40 years ago (1964: 190), to describe their makers as "master craftsmen in the skills of bronze-working." Since then, it is becoming more and more evident that elaborate tripod stands found in funerary contexts of 11th- to 9th-century tombs on Cyprus (Kourion Kaloriziki and Palaepaphos-S&amp;a/es) were made in local workshops at sites such as Enkomi since LC IIC "until, at least, the end of LC III, and perhaps fur ther still to CGI" (Matth?us 1988: 291). Rod tripod stands have been found (in addition to a fragment discovered in the CG wreckage) on Crete and in the Cyclades, but predominantly on Sardinia (Matth?us 1988: figs. 1-6). Based on typological affinities, the tripod stands recorded from Sardinia were divided into two distinctive groups: true Cypriot imports and Sardinian imitations (Macnamara 1985). Lead iso tope analyses indicate that, contrary to the copper ingots (see above, "Trade"), most of the bronze tri pod stands were made on Sardinian soil (Gale and Stos-Gale 1985). The Sardinian origin of these tri pods, if accepted,45 still requires stylistic and tech nical studies in order to distinguish between those made by Sardinian vs. non-Sardinian craftsmen. A pioneer study of this kind enabled Vagnetti to clas sify several fragments of the tripod stand repertory found on Sardinia as "locally produced with a very good knowledge of the real Cypriot products" (1986: 208, fig. 3:1, 2, 3, vs. fig. 3:4, 5). Consequently, Catling (1986: 215) has suggested that these tripods 45 For analyses showing that, contrary to the copper ingots, the lead ratio of the bronze tripods is consistent with the "Sardinian Field," see also Stos-Gale and Gale 1992; Muhly 1996: 48-49; and more recently Kassianidou 2001: 105-9; Lo Schiavo 2001: 140 41; Begemann et al. 2001: 59-60.</page><page sequence="27">2005 URBANISM ON LATE BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 27 be assigned to Cypriot bronzesmiths who left their home ca. 1200 b.c.e. and "travelled for safety, not just west to the Aegean but further west still to Sar dinia." It is tempting to accept this scenario, since earlier LC IIC metal-trading activities in the central Mediterranean might have provided a bridgehead for LC IIIA craftsmen to take refuge on the remote metalliferous island of Sardinia, where they and their descendants presumably continued the skill of tripod-making for generations to come. The same scenario has lately been elaborated by other scholars. Kassianidou (2001: 109) postulates that "although the majority of Cypriot finds in Sar dinia date to the 13th century, contacts between the two islands continue to the 12th and perhaps to the 11th." She also argues that "unlike other areas, Cy prus does not really go into a period of recession after the 12th century." Instead, Cyprus adopted iron, a new metal also available on the island, while other nonexistent precious metals (including gold, silver, and tin) were acquired on Sardinia in order to pro duce luxurious artifacts for the new ruling elite that arose on Cyprus in the 11th century. Matth?us (2001 : 177) suggests further that the presence of this elite is evidenced by "opulent burial customs," includ ing "heroic" cremations on Cyprus (Salamis Tomb 1; Kourion-Kaloriziki Tomb 40; and Palaepaphos-Sfca/es Tomb 49); Crete (the North Cemetery at Knossos); Euboea (the Hero?n at Lefkandi), and Attica (the Keramikos at Athens), to mention only the most prominent examples of the 11th?10th centuries.46 According to his scenario (Matth?us 2001: 177), "it is in the level of these elites?and their counterparts in the prominent social groups of Nuraghic Sar dinia?that cultural connections between East and West were retained." CONCLUDING REMARKS Continuity or discontinuity is the most disputed issue among scholars who are involved in the highly debated problem of the LC II/LC III transition. The material culture remains do not allow us to reach a consensus regarding this issue (Hadjisavvas 1991; Sherratt 1991; 1998; ?str?m 1998). Evidence for coexistence (synoecism) of the indigenous popula 46And also Desborough 1972: 268-72; Coldstream 1977: 55-74; 1994; Morris 1989: 170-83; and lately, Coldstream and Mazar 2003. tion, West Semites from the Levant, and groups of the elusive "Sea Peoples"47 on 12th-century Cyprus makes it difficult to offer a comprehensive scenario based on a reliable correlation between the historical and archaeological data. However, it seems logical to expect, as occurred in the coastal and lowland areas of the southern Levant (Stager 1995; Dothan 1998), that a certain degree of acculturation did exist among the heterogeneous communities residing on Cyprus in that period. Although comparative studies reveal that the time span, extent, and nature of accul turation in Cyprus and the southern Levant were not the same (Iacovou 1998; Bunimovitz 1998; Barako 2003), there are decisive archaeological data demon strating that in both territories indigenous cultural traditions continued from the 13th into the 12th cen tury (Negbi 1991; Astr?m 1998). On Cyprus, as in the Levant, circumstances became fairly stable in the 11th century (Mazar 1994; Catling 1994). The fluc tuating pattern of settlements throughout the entire life span of ProBA Cyprus (tables 2, 3) shows that, after a substantial decrease in the 12th century, the number of coastal urban sites increased consider ably in the 11th, reaching the same number as those of the 13th century (fig. 2). In this respect, LC IIIB is justly regarded as both a renaissance of LC IIC and the beginning of a new era which brought about the rise of independent city kingdoms on the island (Steel 1993; Iacovou 1994; Buitron-Oliver and Her scher 1997; Reyes 1997; Rupp 1997). Based on a r??valuation of the archaeological evi dence, a historical model of a tripartite urban cycle, corresponding to the major part of ProBA Cyprus (Knapp 1994: 282-90), can be postulated as follows: (1) Emergence and gradual development of the MC III/LC I-LC IIA/IIB towns; (2) the "Golden Age" of coastal and inland regional polities in LC IIC (Negbi 1991; Cadogan 1998); and (3) destruction and aban donment of many urban centers, which roughly co incide with movements of various ethnic groups to and from the island in LC IIIA.48 Muhly (1992: 10) has pointed out that we are concerned here not only with the reasons that brought about "the crisis years" of LC IIIA, but 47 It is beyond the scope of this paper to dwell further on the perplexing origin of the "Sea Peoples" and their expansion to Cyprus and the Levant (e.g., Sandars 1985; Niemeier 1998; Do than 1998; Karageorghis 2000; Singer 2000; Barako 2003). 48 Archaeological models of migration (Anthony 1997) fully correspond to the arrival of foreign settlers on Cyprus on the one hand, and the exodus of Cypriot craftsmen to Sardinia on the other.</page><page sequence="28">28 ORA NEGBI BASOR 337 mainly with the manner in which "Eastern Mediter ranean peoples responded to the disasters that have befallen them." It was actually in LC IIIB, with the foundation of autonomous city kingdoms on Cy prus, that a new tripartite cycle had begun. This cycle lasted, with ups and downs, through the Phoe nician and Greek colonization and came to an end with the Assyrian conquest of the island around 700 b.c.e. (Iacovou 1994; Snodgrass 1994: 169-71, fig. 2). However, it must be emphasized that, despite the impact of external factors on the political, economic, sociodemographic, and cultural changes, several as pects of the indigenous cultural heritage continued during the successive cycles of ProBA Cyprus and beyond. This phenomenon is well exemplified by three main aspects. First, several urban and rural cult places contin ued to maintain their sanctity for a long period of time. These include the successive LC IIC-LC IIIB usage of Temple 1 at Kition (table 2:3) on which was superimposed the huge Phoenician "Temple of As tarte"; the dismantled LC IIIA horned altar of the rural sanctuary site at Myrtou-Pighades (table 3:S2) that was revisited in the CG; the LC IIC-LC IIIB t?menos of the rural sanctuary site at Ayia Irini (table 3:S1) that became one of the most popular cult places in the Archaic period (Mavrogiannis 1999; Winbladh 2003); and the LC IIC-LC IIIB sanctuary at Kouklm-Palaepaphos (table 2:10) that was inher ited by the Roman "Temple of Aphrodite" (Maier 1999). Second, the LC IIIB renaissance brought about a revival of the traditional "Cypro-Minoan" syllabic script (akin to Linear A, which dates back to the 15th century) that was reused on the island (after a 12th century gap) from the 11th century onward for uni lingual (indigenous Cypriot) and bilingual (Cypriot and Phoenician or Greek) inscriptions, predomi nantly on votive and funerary paraphernalia (Chad wick 1970: 20-25; Catling 1994: 136; Powell 2002: 240-46; Bazemore 2002: 194-99).49 Third, toponym etymology of "Alashiya" is pre served in the present villages of Alassa and Alaas (fig. 1). The ancient site of Alassa, an inland urban 49The engraved inscription on a bronze obelos from Palae OdiOhos-Skales (Tomb 49) has far-reaching ethnolinguistic im plications. In fact, it is a Cypriot syllabic transliteration of the Greek-named owner of the obelos, which shows that the preposi tional grammatical systems of the Arcadian and Mycenaean Greek dialects were equally used in Bronze Age Cyprus (Karageorghis 1990: 32, fig. 18; 1994: 6-7; most recently Sherratt 2003). center situated in the upper Kouris Valley, appar ently exploited (like Kalavasos-Ay/cw Dhimitrios) the natural sources of copper, clay, and wood (in cluding olive trees) available on the southern and southeastern slopes of the Troodos (Hadjisavvas 1996a). I fully agree with Goren et al. (2003: 250) that the phonetic similarity between ancient Alashiya and modern Alassa "cannot decisively identify the location of Alashiya" but "it would point only to a general area in which the political center of the island could have been located." By the same logic, it seems legitimate to argue, based on the phonetic similarity of ancient "Alashiya" to the modern vil lage of Alaas, which occupies the northernmost tip of Famagusta Bay,50 that Alashiya of the historical documents could have been located somewhere in the same bay. In this respect, the recent analyses of the "Alashiya Tablets" offer a most important con tribution toward reevaluating the whereabouts of the capital city of the "Kingdom of Alashiya" in the 14th-13th centuries b.c.e. (table 10). The data presented in table 10 demonstrate that the clay used for making the cuneiform (henceforth CU) script of the "Alashiya Tablets" from El-Amarna is petrographically related to the inscribed Cypro Minoan (henceforth CM) cylinders from Kalavasos Ayios Dhimitrios (see above, "Pottery Manufacture") on the one hand, but decisively differ from the tab lets and cylinder found at Enkomi on the other. Given the results of their analyses, Goren et al. have preliminarily assumed (2003: 252) that at ca. 1400 b.c.e. the main "seat of power" on Cyprus moved from the coast to the hinterland. In other words, dur ing the 14th-13th centuries, the "King of Alashiya" residing in Alassa or Kalavasos must have been ei ther the overlord of the other Cypriot polities, or a "primus inter pares," whereas Enkomi continued to serve as a gateway community for Cypriot copper trade with the Levant. I am well aware of the grow ing consensus among archaeologists to challenge the validity of Keswani's hierarchic model (Knapp 1997b: 53-59). In this respect, Goren et al.'s study (2004: 57-75), based on geological considerations, presents, contrary to Keswani (see above, "Political Entities"), a complete change in the hierarchic posi tion of productive inland towns vs. commercial coastal towns in the 14th-13th centuries (see above, 50On the Cypro-Geometric cemetery occupying this site, see Karageorghis 1975.</page><page sequence="29">2005 URBANISM ON LATE BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 29 Table 10.

This model seems untenable when taking the following considerations into account. 1. P?trographie analyses indicate that the items bear ing Cypro-Minoan (henceforth CM) inscriptions found at Kalavasos-Ay/os Dhimitrios (see above, "Pottery Manufacture") and Enkomi were delib erately made from clay sources available in close proximity to each of these sites (table 10). 2. Goren et al. (2004: 65) have convincingly demon strated that, when using the technique of impress ing CU characters in clay, source material of mid plasticity is the best choice; therefore, one can eas ily explain why clay deposits from the Troodos were intentionally selected for making the Alashiya Tablets. The geological data presented in table 10 indicate that this is not as simple as expected, be cause the textures of the analyzed tablets from Amarna and Ugarit are not the same.51 3. In any event, it is not surprising to find out that there is a certain functional distinction between the short CM inscriptions of the Ayios Dhimitrios cylinders listed in table 10 and the long CM in scriptions of several tablets and a cylinder from Enkomi. Given the legible Alashiya Tablets, it is tempting to suggest that the long CM inscrip tions from Enkomi were also a sort of official doc 51 Suffice it to say that at least two of the analyzed "Alashiya Tablets," one from El-Amarna and the other from Ugarit (table 10: EA 57 and RSL.l) are petrographically of inconclusive prove nance on the island. In any event, since only one tablet from Ugarit has been analyzed, it is statistically invalid. ument.52 Yet, judging from their script, it seems likely that they were internal documents issued by the local elite to the indigenous inhabitants of the island. Of course, the CU tablets from El-Amarna and Ugarit were written in Akkadian, the lingua franca of international royal correspondence, and as such they served as external documents attest ing to the high status of the "King of Alashiya" among the Mediterranean great powers in the 14th and 13th centuries. 4. Given the easy access from the Troodos to any lowland area of the island, there is no justification to withdraw the possibility raised by Karageorghis that transport of a specific kind of clay from the highland to any given site on the plain was already taking place in the beginning of ProBA (Goren et al. 2004: 65). Moreover, based on the extent of Cypriot trading activity in the Mediterranean dur ing the 14th-13th centuries (see above, "Trade"), locating Alashiya in a coastal rather than an inland town seems more probable. 5. Excavations at Kalavasos-Ay/os Dhimitrios and Alassa-Paliotaverna indicate that urban architec tural remains in both sites postdate ca. 1300 b.c.e. (table 2:6, 9). Nevertheless, chamber tombs pre dating ca. 1300 b.c.e. discovered in the official section of Ayios Dhimitrios and in the domestic 52Emilia Masson (1971) has pointed out that the CM inscrip tion engraved on a cylinder from Enkomi is a unique case. By con trast to the short inscriptions on the Ayios Dhimitrios cylinders, it contains 27 lines and, as such, can safely be compared with the long CM inscriptions of the tablets found in the same site.</page><page sequence="30">30 ORA NEGBI BASOR 337 quarters of Alassa-Pano Mandilaris (South 1996: 40-46; 1997: 158-73; Hadjisavvas 1996a) raise a serious stratigraphie dilemma. Nonetheless, Mann ing and Monks (1998) have rightly demonstrated that the stratigraphy of these tombs is not an iso lated phenomenon. They have mentioned several other cases of coastal sites on the island in which LC IIC ashlar buildings were constructed over (and frequently destroyed) preexisting rock-cut tombs.53 This implies, according to their view, that "the rising oligarchy of a new bureaucratic admini stration" who established the regional network of political entities is to be held responsible for "changing the face of Cyprus" in the 13th century (Manning and Monks 1998: 48-49).54 Further more, the rich contents of several Ayios-Dhimitrios tombs (especially Tomb 11) attest to foreign burial practices (Goring 1989; South and Russell 1989; Todd and South 1992; South 1996; 1997). Given the literary evidence for intensive exchange be tween Cyprus and Egypt in the El-Amarna era, one may expect to find certain archaeological remains of Egyptian "gifts" in the 14th-century coastal emporta on southern or southeastern Cy prus (fig. 1), such as Kourion (Christou 1997) and Maroni-Tsaroukkas (Manning and de Mita 1997). The Aegyptiaca recorded from Hala Sultan Tekke, including a royal mace head of the late 18th Dy nasty (above, n. 5), does not exclude the possibil ity that the residency of the "King of Alashiya" in the 14th century was located at this very site. 6. Goren et al. (2003: 252) estimate that Alassa and Kalavasos-Ay/os Dhimitrios shared the same hier archic position. My study, summarized in table 6, confirms this estimation, but it demonstrates that Enkomi reached the highest urban status on Cyprus 53Pre-LC IIC urban architectural remains have not been re corded from either Ay ios Dhimitrios or Alassa- Paliotaverna. However, several 14th-century tombs from Ay ios Dhimitrios (es pecially Tomb 11) were discovered below the 13th-century ashlar buildings X and XI (Goring 1989: 98-104; South and Russell 1989; South 1996: 40-46; 1997: 156-73). The rock-cut tombs from Maroni were discovered under Building 1 at Tsaroukkas and the "Ashlar Building" at Vournes. Several tombs were sealed by the street adjacent to Building X at Ay ios Dhimitrios, and the southern fa?ade of "B?timent 18" at Enkomi overlies the Swedish Tomb 18. 54In any event, the foundation of the two inland towns at Alassa and Ayios Dhimitrios was actually connected to the changes that took place in the 13th century with the introduction of town planning and ashlar masonry to the coastal urban centers on the island. in the 13th century. It goes without saying that the shift of the coastal capital of Alashiya from the only 14th-century emporium in the Larnaca Bay (Hala Sultan Tekke) to the only 13th-century em porium in the Bay of Famagusta (Enkomi) actually reflects the shift of the political and economic sta tus in the east Mediterranean in the transition from the Pax Aegyptiaca to the Pax Hethitiaca. This as sumption, which supports the long-accepted view that the historical capital of Alashiya is to be lo cated at the site of Enkomi (Dussaud 1952; Kara georghis 1969: 11-22; 1975: 1-4; Baurain 1984; Knapp 1985), has lately been adapted by Manning and de Mita (1997: 109-10) who argued that "a model with the king of Alashiya (perhaps Enkomi) as paramount over kings and chiefs in other hier archies of Cyprus is attractive."55 In fact, if this is really the case, it can safely be assumed, contrary to Goren and his colleagues, that neither Alassa nor Ayios Dhimitrios, but only Enkomi, actually embodied the true face of 13th-century Cyprus overseas.56 Moreover, archaeological discoveries reveal that, in the 11th century b.c.e., the old, silted port of Enkomi was replaced by a new one at Salamis (Yon 1990; 1999). As a result, Salamis, which inherited Bronze Age Enkomi in LC IIIB, probably corresponds to the harbor city in the "Land of Alashiya" mentioned in the itinerary of Wenamun (Wilson 1969; Baurain 1984: 248, 253; Weinstein 1998; Sass 2002). Furthermore, Salamis was not the only coastal town in the Bay of Fam agusta at that time, but became the most important emporium on Cyprus from LC IIIB throughout the Geometric, Archaic, Classical, Roman, and Early Christian eras (Karageorghis 1969: 197-98). Finally, it is worth remembering that, compared with major continental countries, the longue dur?e of cultural traditions (Braudel 1980: 25-54) is espe 55 By the same token, they were aware that contrary to the "Kingdom of Alashiya" mentioned in historical texts, "Cyprus is an enigma in as much as we lack unmistakable traces of palatial centers with organized bureaucrats of a ruling elite" (Manning and de Mita 1997: 109-10). 56 A 13th-century ritual foundation tablet from B?gazk?y (Kbo IV. 1), which mentions the provenance of copper and bronze in the mountain of Taggata at Alashiya (Baurain 1984: 272), does not necessarily imply that Hittite officials saw the metal deposits of the Troodos with their own eyes. It seems more likely that they heard about the metal resources of the Troodos from Cypriot trad ers of that date in harbor towns at home (Enkomi) or abroad (Ugarit and Ura).</page><page sequence="31">2005 URBANISM ON LATE BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 31 daily remarkable among isolated communities. Given anthropological analogies, there is no doubt that, as a natural barrier, the sea contributes to the cultural isolation of island dwellers (Held 1993). However, large islands, such as Cyprus, Crete, Sicily, and Sar dinia, which lie in close proximity to the coasts of the Levant, Anatolia, Greece, and Italy (fig. 5), played an important role in the network of Mediterranean trad ing routes, and therefore they were exposed to ex ternal influences as early as the second millennium. Cyprus and Sardinia gained a special status in antiq uity, since both possessed natural metal resources that attracted their neighbors. On Cyprus, coastal urban centers like Enkomi, Hala Sultan Tekke, Kourion, and Toumba tou Skourou, which were directly involved in metal trade, had already absorbed the "international" east Mediterranean koine in the 16th century. Given the interisland contacts between Cyprus and Sardinia, it is logical to assume that the same targets that drove Cypriot travelers to Sardinia in the 13th century also pushed the Phoenicians, several centuries later, to sail as far west as the Iberian Peninsula (Muhly 1991: 188-90; 1998; Negbi 1992; Aubet 1994: 133-66; and Kassianidou2001: 110).
