This situation is at least partly due to the fact that neither of the two antagonists has a clear insight in the historical background, the systematical validity, and the practical purposes of the concepts and methods used in traditional philosophy. Therefore further clarification is needed. The following paper does not claim to give final definitions and decisions. It will rather try to draw the attention to certain ways of reasoning still very wide- spread in metaphysics and moral theory. Their careful analysis may throw light on some of the so-called eternal philosophical problems. II It is almost generally assumed that there is a wide gulf between mythological and philosophical thinking and that the achievements especially of the Greek philosophers mark a decisive step forward in the development of human knowl- edge. This opinion is, of course, not entirely false, but it needs substantial re- strictions. In the last decades it has become more and more obvious that Greek philosophy was in method anid scope quite different from modern science.' Today we regard a phenomenon as explained if it can be deduced from general regularities by virtue of particular antecedents. It is neither required that the observed antecedent facts play any role in our everyday life nor that the general hypotheses be psychologically plausible. As shown by Heinrich Gomperz, an entirely different concept of explanation was used especially by the early Greek philosophers. For them, to explain a phenomenon meant "to show that, even though at first sight it may appear very unfamiliar, yet, on closer scrutiny, it turns out not to be entirely unfamiliar, since it exhibits certain analogies with other phenomena, familiar to us from commoni experience."2 A phenornenon functioning in this way as an explanatory analogy Gomperz styles a thought- * This is the enlarged paper of a lecture given in the Institute for the IUnity of Science, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Bostoni on March 16, 1954. 1 F.

In the use of those analogies the early philosophers were very far from brushing aside all their spiritual inheritance and replacing it by a new kind of reflection. They and their followers rather selected out from the bulk of mytho- logical imageries certain definite thought-patterns especially suitable for their purposes. These explanatory models can be traced back to a remote past, if not into the very dawn of human history, but they had also a decisive influence on the later development of classic, mediaeval and even modern philosophy. There are, of course, analogies between almost all things in the world-similari- ties in shape, in size, in value, etc.-and due to this fact is the almost inexhaust- ible richness of mythological pictures. But certain kinds of things and activities, whose vital and/or affective significance for man is obvious, were already in early times often preferred. One of them was the realm of life itself, of fertility and sexuality. These biological models were often used for the explanation of the origins of the world. The universe e.g. was made out of the cosmic egg, float- ing in the primeval waters-another symbol of fertility and probably even sexual energy; or it was begotten by an ancestral couple, usually heaven and earth. Their sacred marriage meant a cosmogony in the literal sense of the word.3 It may be interesting that the sexual analogy in a somewhat modified fashion is still used by Copernicus. He writes that "the earth conceives from the sun and brings forth its yearly offspring."4 In the same context Copernicus tells us that "the sun, sitting on an royal throne, rules the family of stars moving around it."5 The universe is here de- scribed in terms of a human society and its kingly ruler. These sociomorphic thought-patterns are probably as old and as deep-rooted in the traditions of Weltanschauung as the sexual imageries, and linked with them by the idea of family, which is both a social and a sexual community. Already in the mytholo- gies of primitive tribes we find sun and moon as parents and the stars as their children; in a more advanced stage of social organization, they are the royal couple and the other heavenly bodies are their courtiers, officers, soldiers, etc. Thus finally the whole world is conceived as a state, a city or a well-ordered household, and the regularities of nature correspond to the rules that govern civil life. Already in the earliest historical civilizations in the Near East as well as in the Far East we find the idea of what I would call the "socio-cosmic Universe." Besides the biological and social analogies Copernicus uses a third type of simile. He writes in the same chapter: "The sun is stationed in the middle of the universe. For who could place this lamp in a more suitable spot in this most beautiful temple (i.e., the Universe) than one which permits the simultaneous illumination of the whole" and he concludes with the words: "Such indeed is 3K.

If we style them techno- morphic, this term is not to be understood in the sense of modern machinery, but in that of manual skill and productive imagination. Such analogies were already used by the presocratic philosophers,7 but they are even older. Perhaps as early as in the stone-age primitive man-made shelters like tents or round huts furnished the first rough explanatory models for the celestial vault, and the starred heaven was later compared with an embroidered cloak or a divine hel- met.8 Building, weaving, carving or procedures used in pottery played an im- portant role in the mythological explanations of the events in organic as well as inorganic nature. The above mentioned passages of Copernicus are characteristic of the models as well as of the methods of that kind of explanation. Certainly, the great astron- omer uses the sexual, social, and technical imagery only for auxiliary considera- tions, arguing otherwise as clearly and soberly as any modern scientist. But in the older astronomy and especially in the cosmological speculations of the philos- ophers these thought-patterns furnished the main arguments. When it was felt that certain forms, measures, and proportions were in accord with exigencies of artistic beauty, technical convenience, or social rank which were ascribed to the phenomena by the different analogies, it was immediately concluded that the facts actually conform to these postulates. For example, it was assumed that the distances of the stars, of the moon, and of the sun from the center of the earth were in the ratio of 1:2:3-not because any measurements were made to this effect, but because it appeared as fitting that such should be the case.9 Thus value-judgments of the most different and sometimes very obscure origins had often a decisive importance in the explanation of the world. Even explicit evalua- tions can be found in Copernicus, too: "Furthermore the condition of immobility is considered more noble and divine than the condition of change and instability, which therefore is more fitting to the earth than to the universe."'0 These remarks do not intend to belittle the achievements of this outstanding astronomer, but rather to show that even the most independent thinkers and 6 N.

II For the development of philosophy, however, the different kinds of explana- tory models were not equally important. Although the biological or sexual analogies played a tremendous role in mythology,11 they were almost entirely rejected by the philosophers. F. M. Cornford observed quite correctly the elimi- nation of the pictorial sex-imagery-the theogonia and cosmogonia of Hesiod- in the beginnings of what he calls rational thought.'2 As we will see later, the thinkers became more and more inclined to explain even the biological events themselves by terms of craftsmanship. Therefore we may restrict our inquiry to the technomorphic and sociomorphic thought-patterns. The reasons of their success are, of course, different. But the decisive one is obviously the fact that they are taken from deliberate human action."3 Besides this connection with the very base of conscious human life, these analogies made it possible to inteipret the universe as a just and purposeful whole and to derive from its structure allegedly ultimate directives and absolute values. This "cos- mic" foundation of morals and politics was only possible by a process which was of the utmost importance for the later development of philosophy. It was a strange interplay between the projection of social and technical models into the cosmos and their reflection from the cosmos back into the human world.14 Al- though this process was never conscious and often veiled by the ambiguity of language, it is very easily observable in the realm of the technomorphic as well as of the sociomorphic thought-patterns.

This feat having been accomplished . . . the same theories are next transferred back again from organic nature to history and their validity as eternal laws of human society declared to have been proved".

But many cultures were not content with an explanation of that kind. They came to think of the dwellings, weapons or clothing as replicas or symbols of the cosmos.'5 Long before the advent of philosophy this belief found different artistic expressions. Perhaps the most famous example is the shield of Achilles, described in Book XVIII of the Iliad. Hephaistos, the craftsman-god, makes for the hero a great and strong shield with the image of the whole universe. Heaven and earth, sun, moon, and stars are depicted as well as scenes from human life in peace and war; fields and vine- yards, cattle and wild beasts. All this is surrounded by the Ocean Stream. The underlying idea of this cosmic work of art was probably not genuinely Greek, but Asiatic, for we find cosmic symbols of this kind in veiy early times all over Asia. Especially in the Near East the cloak and headgear of priests, kings, or idols were often ornamented with stars or other heavenly emblems.6 In the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. the Persian kings, who were to give the classical world its conception of a divine and universal ruler, held their audiences and festivals in a cosmic tent which was actually called "heaven". From these traditions the great domelike tents of the Mongol Khans can be derived as well as the starred canopies above the enthroned rulers of Rome and Byzantium and the jeweled and embroidered baldachins still used in the Roman Catholic Church. The analogy was carried so far that king Khosro II Parvez of Persia (590-628 A.D.) had a throne room, where the cosmic ruler sat beneath an astronomically deco- rated dome of wood which rotated like the world.'7 Here the reflection of the primitive technomorphic analogy has reached an extreme: First the heaven was understood as a tent or a round hut, and later every possible effort was made to construct an architecture corresponding as closely as possible to the celestial movements. The idea of the cosmic dome was still alive in the sixteenth century, when the famous Italian architect Andrea Palladio admired the circular plan and the domical temple because it is "the most proper figure to shew the Unity, infinite Essence, the Uniformity and Justice of God" and suggested as a possible explanation of the shape of the Pantheon that "it bears the figure of the world."18 Even more archaeological evidence is available for the so-called "cosmic city", i.e., the city or fortress laid out according to the supposed order of the universe. The "cosmic design" meant often only that the shape of the town was a circle or a square, with main gates and streets directed to the four cardinal points of the compass. But there were also more complicated patterns. Sometimes the proportions and the orientation of the streets and buildings were regulated by a meticulously detailed code of allegedly celestial rules. The so-called cosmic numbers play an important role in this connection.'9 When and where the idea 15 E. Baldwin Smith: l.e., p. 79. 16 R. Eisler: l.e., vol. I. H17 . P.

Besides the impressive material gathered by H. P. L'Or- angel' we may mention the example of Mohenjo-daro, a planned town of the pre-Aryan Indus civilisation, where the streets run from west to east and from north to south with rectangular intersections.22 The famous Angkor, the former capital of the Khmer-empire in Indochina, follows a cosmic pattern, just like the temples of the Confucianist Chinese state-religion and even those of the early Mexican civilisation.23 But the idea of the city as a replica of the universe is not at all confined to a remote past. A few decades ago the German ethnologist Leo Frobenius got from his informants a description of the rites used by Central African tribes in the laying out of a roughly cosmic city, and one of the most refined examples was built up in the second half of the last century under the very eyes of the British: Mandalay in Burma.24 A city is, of course, a human community too, and very often we find rather detailed "cosmic" prescriptions for the organisation of society. In the already mentioned case of Burma the number of the cardinal points was the base of the imperial administration. There were four ministers of first and four of second rank, four confidential counsellors, four chief tax-collectors, one for every quarter of the empire. Even the number of the queens had to fit precisely into the univer- night, male and female; 3 = heaven, earth and man; 4 = the seasons, the cardinal points; 5 the cardinal points and the center; 6 = 4 + heaven and earth; 7 = the planets, etc. Practically every number can get a "cosmic meaning either by direct reference to astronomi- cal and meteorological happenings or as the sum or the product of other "cosmic" numbers. 20 0.

Otto Franke has brilliantly analyzed the origins and the structure of the idea of the "socio-cosmic universe".26 AIready in the very dawn of Chinese history nature and society formed an inseparable unity. Heavenly bodies and events were described and explained by means of social terms and analogies, which were in earlier times taken from plain rural life and kinship. Later the whole complicated order of the feudal and monarchical state was projected into the sky. The stars were con- ceived as rulers with a complete court and the starry heaven as a well organized community; there were heavenly bodies called "the Great one", "the prince", "the princess", "the commander in chief", "the first counsellor", "the mounted bodyguard", etc. Thus the cosmos became politicized.27 But the "heavenly city" turned out to be in many respects the master of its own archetype, human society. It was demanded that the social order should be a picture of the universal order.28 Already the state of the Chow dynasty (about 1000 B.C.) tried to be in accord with the cosmic pattern. It had six ministries which had their names from the four seasons and heaven and earth. Even their tasks were chosen in analogy to these names and the careful attention paid to the supposedly natural rules went so far that, e.g., criminals were executed only in fall, the "natural" time for death. To the modern observer this order may appear very strange, but it was preserved at least in principle from the beginnings of the first millenium B.C. until the Confucianist tradition was uprooted by Western influences in the last century.29 Perhaps somewhat less meticulously elaborated but certainly not less obvious is the idea of the socio-cosmic universe in the ancient Near East. Especially in Mesopotamia "the understanding of the cosmos tended to express itself in terms of integration of wills, that is, in terms of social orders such as the family, the community, and, most particularly, the state."30 The sky-god Anu is the force which organizes the whole, insuring obedience to orders, laws, and customs in 25 R.

Like human society, the cosmic state also had minor power groups: divine families, divine households, divine estates with stewards, overseers, servants, and other attendants. Sometimes the order in nature is seen and interpreted exactly as if the universe were a large, smoothly running estate organized by a capable manager.3' But Mesopotamia also produced the most powerful belief in the impact of the universe on human life and especially on society: the star-lore. In earlier times astrology had a definite political meaning. It was therefore the secret of the priests, who used their wisdom for giving advice to the kings- often in decisions of the utmost importance. The use of astrology for private fortune-telling arose after the breakdown of the Oriental empires.32 From the philosophical point of view the most interesting trait of the Mesopotamian star-lore is the idea of universal necessity. The cosmic power determines human fate. Thus we find the idea of the "socio-cosmic universe" all over Asia long before the beginnings of Greek philosophy. Many problems in this connection are, of course, still controversial. We do not even know whether the Chinese univer- salism was influenced by the socio-astral theories of Mesopotamia. There are also certain differences between the cosmic ideologies of the Near East and the Far East. Recently it has been pointed out and perhaps a little overemphasized that in China the idea of a supreme lawgiver and a rigid body of positive laws was not used as an explanatory analogy for natural events.33 The Chinese con- ception of the cosmos was rather characterized by a sense of universal harmony, matching well with a society which was permeated by the impersonal and often unwritten rules of tradition, custom and politeness. But western and eastern Asia agree in the basic concept of a "socialized universe"34, a divine, just, and beautiful "world-order" immensely superior to its very model, human society. It is obvious, that such a view of the cosmos granted deep satisfaction to one of the most powerful yearnings of man: his desire for security. The depressive feeling of loneliness in a hostile world was dispelled. The certainty was won that there is a pre-established order akin to and friendly towards man. If he was ready to fit into the universal pattern, he could be convinced that he is taken care of and need not worry. But there were some difficulties, too: As long as man re- stricted himself to a pious contemplation of the universe in general, he could be quite satisfied. Yet confronted with the stern facts of human life and with the necessity of action, the cosmic ideology showed certain shortcomings. Man should avoid any interference with the universal harmony of the Tao or obey 31 Th. Jacobsen: I.e., p. 161. 32 R. Eisler: The Royal Art of Astrology, London 1946, p. 165. 33 J.

And the belief in the goodness and justice of the world-order even in Mesopo- tamia gave rise to other fundamental problems, such as the justification of death and the sufferings of the righteous.35 Are these problems still mythological or are they already philosophical? A clear-cut answer is hardly possible. For where should we draw a sharp borderline as long as philosophy itself remains under the spell of the sociomorphic and technomorphic imagery? III That the Greek philosophers did not abolish, but rather refined these thought- patterns is now widely acknowledged. What still remains dubious is merely to what extent they were directly or indirectly influenced by the Asiatic specula- tions. In general the historians of philosophy are inclined to underrate the impact of Asia on Western thought and civilisation. The fundamental importance of the social and technical models for Greek philosophy has been shown by Heinrich Gomperz and Werner Jaeger in their above mentioned works and by Hans Kelsen.36 We find the idea of cosmic justice already in one of the first documents of presocratic philosophy, the famous frag- ment of Anaximander: "And into that from which things take their rise, they pass away once more, as is meet, for they make reparation and satisfaction to one another for their injustice according to the ordering of time."37 To this fragment Werner Jaeger remarks that "Anaximander .. . was formulating a moral, not a physical law of nature.... It is not a compendious description of events, but a justification of the nature of the universe: he shows creation to be a cosmos 'writ large'-namely a community of things under law.... His idea of dike (= cosmic justice) is the first stage in the projection of the life of the city- state upon the life of the universe".38 Besides this, the household or estate, the main economical community, was often used as an explanatory analogy-just as in Mesopotamia.9 Furthermore, we can observe in Greek philosophy the same process of projection and reflection as in the socio-cosmic mythologies of Asia. The celestial movements and other natural events were described in terms and analogies borrowed from social and/or technical activities. Thus the concept of an. all-embracing, just, beautiful, and purposeful "world-order" was created, and it was demanded that human society should be in agreement with the sup- posedly moral structure of the universe. Human laws should be obeyed because and insofar as they were a part of the rules governing the "'cosmos", which be- came by this reflection the pattern of the 'right order' in society, the metaphys- ical foundation of city-state morality.40 These general observations are confirmed by the fact that most of the basic 35Th.

Kosmos (mundus) was the political and/or military order and organisation, but it had also the meaning of artistic beauty.4' Nomos (lex) was the custom and later the law, whereas aitia (causa) was changed from a concept of morality (guilt) into the main concept of the causal order.42 Not less important are the analogies taken from craftsmanship and the arts. Harmonia meant originally the orderly adjustment of parts in a complex fabric, then the tuning of a musical instrument and finally the musical scale.48 In philosophy the word is used to denote the regu- larity, beauty, and justice of the universe. Substantially technomorphic are also both the Platonic idea and the Aristotelian entelechy. The idea, eidos and morphe, is the paradigm, the normative model of a thing. The realm of ideas contains the shapes of the objects as their divine patterns or designs, to which they must conform in order to be perfect. Even more obvious is the use of analogies between certain natural events and purposeful human action in Aristotle. The living beings are conceived as products of superhuman craftsmanship, which realizes "from within" pre-established forms in a given matter. The basic notions of potency and act are taken from human power and ability, which now remains latent and now becomes active (ergon), attaining its end (entelechy) only in its activity (energeia).44 Throughout technomorphic is also the Aristotelian concept of causality, the well-known theory of the four causes: causa materialis, causa formalis, causa efficiens, causa finalis.45 The underlying model is quite obvious. The working man has the aim (finis) to produce (efficere) an object of a pre- conceived and designed shape (forma) out of some matter (materia). This "arti- ficialism"46 is still alive in the belief that the cause somehow "produces" the effect. The influence of the sociomorphic and technomorphic thought-patterns was again increased when the victories of Alexander opened the floodgates and the socio-cosmic ideology of the East poured into the West. The Stoic philosophers -many of them were not native Greeks but of Asiatic descent-unified the Hellenic and the Oriental traditions into a very impressive and comprehensive system. As in the absolutistic monarchy, which had succeeded to the free city- state, so also in their metaphysics there was only one supreme and absolute power.47 This principle, the World-Reason (logos) or Nature (physis) or World- 41 W.

It rules, designs, and effects everything in the world. Nothing exists and happens outside or against the power of "Reason" or "Nature". The activity of the cosmic principle was explained in the well known terms naturam esse artificem, mundum esse urbem vel domum bene administratam-Nature is a craftsman, the world is a well-ordered city or household. Analogies of this kind can be found on almost every page of the Stoics and their followers.48 Among them the short treatise "On the World" (De mundo) deserves special attention, because it makes the most unrestricted use of these pictures. The cosmic power-here already identi- fied with God-appears sometimes as an Oriental king, surrounded by his courtiers and officers,49 sometimes as a craftsman (mechanotechnes) or a wire- puller (neurospastes). The divine agent produces even human actions like the movements of puppets. Used in such a blunt manner, these pictures appear some- what clumsy. But even the loftiest speculations were based on the same thought- patterns. The rise of Christianity meant no substantial change. The early Christian philosophers borrowed these ideas from their pagan colleagues. Thus the socio- morphic and technomorphic models were saved for two more millenia. Chris- tianity as the state-religion of the Roman Empire endowed Jesus Christ with the majesty of the world-ruling Logos (Logos cosmocrator)'0 This idea of cosmic kingship was supplemented by the idea of cosmic craftsmanship: God was con- ceived as the Optimus Maximus Opifex. Finally the most extensive use of de- liberate human action as explanatory analogy was made by Thomas Aquinas.5 But already a few decades after the death of Thomas Aquinas an acute critic, William Ockham, disclosed the weak spot of the whole system of technomorphic and sociomorphic thought-patterns: the difference between genuine purposive action and its use as an explanatory analogy in the realm of natural events."2 Despite this incisive criticism the anthropomorphic imageries faded away very slowly. Not even the corroding effects of modern science could destroy them en- tirely. For reasons we will discuss later these thought-patterns are in our time still used and protected by powerful social groups. As late as the eighteenth century the models taken from deliberate human activity were strong enough to conquer even new realms. They entirely dominated the so-called philosophy of history, which then came into being and had its heyday later in the time of Hegel, Marx, and Comte. It was almost generally assumed that history is a 48 H. v. Arnim: Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta, vol. II, Lipsiae 1903, pp. 327-332. 49 (Pseud.)-Aristoteles: De mundo, 398 b. 50 H. P.

The strongly evaluative and practical component of these constructions is obvious especially in the case of Marxism. The "Law of History" gives directives for political action combined with a guarantee of victory.64 IV The historical account given above is far from being exhaustive. It is rather a short outline of the most important developments. Nevertheless it may be suffi- cient as a base for the logico-systematical appraisal of the sociomorphic and technomorphic analogies. No doubt the idea of a beautiful, just, and divine uni- verse, which is somehow friendly and akin to man and human purpose, is one of the most fascinating inventions of mankind. But some difficulties and contra- dictions arose very early. 1) If the alleged "Law of the Universe" or normative "Idea of Man" is the supreme rule for human behaviour-what is its content? Which are the concrete directives for human conduct and social organization derivable from these principles of absolute justice? This first question is generally known as the problem of natural law or natural right. 2) If the cosmic principle (Reason, Nature etc.) is not conceived as a mere pre- scription but as an absolutely ruling power, how is physical and moral evil possible? This problem is traditionally styled theodicy: si Deus, unde malum? But the same difficulty arises for any supreme entity which is believed to be omnipotent and good, e.g., for the Logos of the Stoics. Therefore it may be more convenient to call this problem logodicy. Closely connected with this question is the third: 3) If the divine agent produces or effects its very prototype-human action itself-as the wire-puller the motions of his puppets, how is human responsi- bility possible? We have the alternative either of maintaining the omnip- otence of the supreme principle and blaming it for the wickedness of man or of restricting divine power in order to save it from being responsible for human misbehaviour. Here we find the very root of the so-called free-will problem: the mutual interference of human will and the "will" of the anthro- pomorphic universal power. In Antiquity as well as in the Middle Ages that question was discussed almost entirely in terms of evaluation: On the one side there was the evaluative postulate of divine omnipotence, on the other side the evaluative postulate of divine goodness and the practical usage of punishing wrongdoers. The decisive factor in the acceptance of an alleged solution was of coursa not any empirical test but again a consideration of value: Which of those postulates should be regarded as the more important 53 K.

Observation of the facts, e.g. psychological or physiological inquiry, played a very subordinate role, if any.55 It is striking that none of these problems found a satisfactory answer despite the most serious efforts of the philosophers during more than two thousand years. Instead of one well-established and reliable natural right we have dozens of different and often contradictory ideologies. They all claim to be the true law of nature, but no criterion is given as to how we should decide among them. The justification of the Logos and the mutual interference of human will and "provi- dence" or "necessity" are even more enigmatic. Therefore the suspicion arises that there must be somewhere something fundamentally wrong. It can now be shown rather easily that these difficulties are due to serious short- comings of the sociomorphic and technomorphic interpretation of the world. They disappear as theoretical problems if we drop those imagistic systems which are inadequate to the facts and often even contradictory in themselves. Modern science dropped them some time ago. The physicist, e.g., is concerned with meas- urements and their mathematical interrelations, which do not even touch the questions of giving directives for human activities or of granting moral satis- faction. Certainly, if we decide to abolish those venerable imageries, we have to be ready to sacrifice the belief, that the universe is basically friendly to man. Whether that often regretted "disenchantment" is a real loss or rather a mis- understanding, will become clear later. For the critical analysis of the analogies mentioned above it may be useful to start from the experiences and notions of everyday life and to show in a very plain manner the origins and the limitations of the anthropomorphic thought- patterns. First it has to be emphasized that these analogies are not wrong merely because they are anthropomorphic. Like any analogy, these can have a remark- able heuristic value, but they are extremely dangerous if they are not used cau- tiously. Such conceptual models made even powerful thinkers overlook funda- mental differences in favor of the most superficial resemblances. The essence of the sociomorphic and technomorphic world view is the de- scription and evaluation of certain natural events and regularities in terms of purposive human action and its directives, procedures, and products. The logical appraisal of these thought-patterns has therefore to start with the scrutiny of the similarities and the differences between human activity on the one side and the natural processes in question on the other. But the examination of these pro- jections is only the first step. Much more important for our task is the critical analysis of the reflection of anthropomorphic concepts from the "personalized" or "socialized" nature upon their very archetype, genuine human action. Human beings have the capacity to influence future events by their deliberate behavior. They face several possibilities and have to make choices and decisions of widely divergent degrees of importance. A choice means always the preference of one way of action and the rejection of all the others. Thus a practical dualism is inherent in decision as well as in evaluation in general: the contrast of ac- cepted and refused, loved and hated, desirable and undesirable things or 15 J.

To evaluate all objects equally would mean not to evaluate at all. Furthermore, to decide often implies to undertake a risk. Finding himself in such a situation, the human agent may often have a strong feeling of uneasiness and insecurity. But he is backed by society. His group gives him for the decisions a fairly reliable set of directives. Some of them are formulated as an explicit moral and/or juristic code, even more are given only indirectly by the evaluations implicit in everyday language. These directives are often combined with guar- antees against the risks of a socially approved or demanded action. Certainly, this impersonal and collective "cake of customs" is not exempt from historical change, but generally the change is too slow to produce any serious troubles. The relative stability of such a set of rules may really function as a tertium comparationis between them and the astronomical or meteorological regularities. By means of that analogy the idea of a comprehensive "socio-cosmic" order can be established. But this concept loses its basis exactly in the degree in which the social structure is changing. As long as the customs and laws are stable they may be regarded as a part of the "universal order" and therefore as inviolable. But when despite its supposedly "cosmic" legitimation the social order is disturbed, the tertium comparationis of stability and reliability disappears and the whole construction breaks down. Different ideologies of competing groups claim to be the "true Law of Nature" and there is of course no scientific decision possible, because the motions of the stars or the tides of the sea are morally and politically neutral. Exactly the same is the case when biological regularities as morpho- genesis or the constancy of species are interpreted as realizations of an immutable preconceived "design" or "nature"-and then man is summoned to obey certain directives in order to be perfectly in accord with a normative paradigm called "human nature". As long as the social rules and cultural ideals are unquestioned, they may really appear as stable as the biological uniformities mentioned above. Both may be even "integrated" into a comprehensive "concept of man" (Men- schenbild). Nevertheless, when the underlying evaluations change or fade away, the "well-integrated whole" falls asunder. It becomes obvious that the biological regularities of the human organism are compatible with the most different pat- terns of culture. In every case the sociomorphic and technomorphic interpreta- tion of the world turns out to be unable to support any moral or social prescrip- tions. Nevertheless, the idea of "fitting into the pattern of the universe" or "living according to nature" was not entirely based on futile analogies. It had also a plain but sound base. Agriculture and navigation are as deeply connected with astronomy and meteorology as medicine with biology. The peasant, sailor, and physician must really adjust his activities to the pre-existent "cosmic order" or "human nature". In all these cases the observation of the facts gives to the human agent certain conditional directives or-to use the language of Kant- hypothetical imperatives. Knowledge shows which means have to be used in order to attain certain desired goals, as plentiful crops, safe navigation, or good health. But often the allegedly "cosmic" directives did not indicate adequate means e.g., in the case of the "cosmic city". There is no causal connection be-</page><page sequence="15">SOCIETY, TECHNOLOGY, AND PHILOSOPHICAL REASONING 289 tween the celestial movements, the design of a town, and its fate in history. Al- though the sentence "Men should lay ollt their dwellings according to the four cardinal points" can not be regarded as a sound hypothetical imperative to bring about human well-being, it has still a definite content connected with certain astronomical facts. But the most general and most "philosophical" propositions, e.g., "Men should respect the cosmic order" or "Men must not disturb the uni- versal harmony", lack any normative and/or factual content. They are empty formulae. These considerations are confirmed by the analysis of the historically given theories of "natural law". Already Henry Sidgwick criticized "a certain class of sham-axioms .. . which appear certain and self-evident because they are sub- stantially tautological.... One important lesson which the history of moral philosophy teaches is that, in this region, even powerful intellects are liable to acquiesce in tautologies of this kind; sometimes expanded into circular reasonings, sometimes hidden in the recesses of an obscure notion, often lying so near the surface that, when once they have been exposed, it is hard to understand how they could ever have presented themselves as important".88 More recently Vilfredo Pareto, Alf Ross, Hans Kelsen, and others have shown that the so-called prin- ciples of natural law are for the most part empty formulae or meaningless tau- tologies.57 The most impressive example of that kind of reasoning is perhaps the famous Telos-formula of the Stoics, the equation Telos Physis = Nomos = Logos = Kosmos, i.e. the Aim = the Natural = Universal Law = Divine Rea- son = Cosmos.58 How men should behave or how society should be organized in order to be in conformity with these ideas remains after all as mysterious as it was before. That classical instance of defining one unknown by another is, how- ever, really "self-evident", because it is analytic.59 But due to its emptiness it is compatible with every possible moral and social order. Nevertheless, the secret of the historical success of such tautological formulae and circular inferences lies precisely in their vacuity. Because they lack any con- tent they can be used for 'justifying' any positive or desired legal and moral system. They made it possible to endow any and every ideological position with the claim of universal validity. For more than two thousand years such void ex- pressions have served the most diverse values and ideals, purposes and interests. The Greek sage and the Roman jurist, the Catholic schoolman and the man of letters of the Enlightenment, the liberal free-trader and the socialist revolu- tionary were all able to use this long-venerated vocabulary in order to establish their doctrines as "truly natural" or "truly reasonable" and to give them in this way the appearance of a higher legitimation.60 Add to this, that such empty 56 H.

They awaken- especially in the governed-the impression of the unshakable security of ulti- mate principles, while they in no way hinder the guiding authorities in their concrete decisions. Thus it can be shown that the so-called eternal rules of natural law are void phrases which can be used by everybody for any purpose-just as everybody who has the will and the power can use a cosmic tent or a starred canopy. But even if the alleged "universal laws" or "principles of human nature" are empty formulae, they are not self-contradictory as long as they are conceived only as directives. Just here the new problem arises. People were often embarrassed by the idea that the Weltgeist would be so impotent as to remain a mere ideal, aspiration or set of prescriptions. Therefore they assumed that the just and good principle wields absolute power in the world as a kind of Cosmic King or Cosmic Crafts- man. This belief was expressed in sentences like ens et bonum convertuntur, Being and Good are identical, or Was vernuenftig ist, das ist wirklich, und was wirklich ist, das ist vernuenftig, What is rational is real and what is real is rational.6' If we take such propositions in their strict sense we can criticize them in a purely analy- tic way without reference to any empirical facts and evaluations. As already mentioned above, choice and evaluation always implies a practical dualism be- tween the preferred and the refused, the desirable and the undesirable etc. Sentences which do not contain any preferences or rules for preferences and de- cisions are from the axiological viewpoint empty. Formulae which do not say anything about the questions of actual human decisions and evaluations are, e.g., "every being is good" or "reasonable" or "rational." If they nevertheless claim to have any evaluative or normative content, they become self-contra- dictory, because it is logically impossible to give preferences and no preferences at once. Thus the alternative arises either to maintain the "monistic" formulae and to avoid any evaluation or to introduce-however disguised-the "dualism" of actual choice and decision. This difficulty was generally felt by the philosophers but not clearly recognized. They tried to handle it in different ways. As long as only a contemplative feeling of metaphysical security was needed the short- comings of the empty formulae were not too obvious. But in face of the real prob- lems of action and decision the "identity of being and good" broke asunder. The inherent dualism of choice forced the thinkers to drop the unity and/or univer- sality of "being". The concept of being was split up or it ceased to cover the whole of human experience. In both cases only the good was acknowledged by defi- nition62 as "being" in the proper sense. Sometimes the valuable was styled the "real", "true", "actual", "essential" being63, whereas the less desirable was Valuable material can be found in the books by H. Kelsen, V. Pareto, A. Ross, H.

Knox translates the sentence Was vernuenftig ist, das ist wirklich, und was wirk-</page><page sequence="17">SOCIETY, TECHNOLOGY, AND PHILOSOPHICAL REASONING 291 "merely empirical" being; sometimes the evil was bluntly called non-being. It is obvious that such definitions had no influence whatsoever on the role of the physical and moral evil in human life or on the practical necessities of evaluation and action. They were only linguistic conventions made in order to save the identity of being and good by restricting the use of the term "being" exclusively to valuable objects and by excluding everything else. In any case the idea of the "uniestrictedly good universe" becomes untenable: either there is no evaluation at all or the world is split up according to presupposed standards of value. All these difficulties become inescapable when the cosmic ideology is con- fronted with the situations of practical life. The most impressive and historically influential example of a philosophy caught in these contradictions is probably the Stoic doctrine. As long as these thinkers in their metaphysical speculations re- main in an attitude of merely contemplative admiration, the universe appears as just, beautiful and purposeful; reality is viewed as a "well-ordered city" under the inviolable Law of the Logos. In their ethics, however, these philoso- phers have to face the stern facts of human life and the problems of inevitable decisions. Then the blissful harmony of the cosmos seems to be entirely forgotten and the highest achievement of the sage is the unshakable steadfastness in the struggle against the whims of irrational Fortune. Many of these troubles Christian thought inherited from its pagan predecessors.64 In Christian theology and meta- physics there is a strong tendency to emphasize divine goodness and power and to minimize the importance of evil or in last consequence to deny its "reality" at all. But in moral philosophy and even more in the popular belief this "mon- istic" tendency is replaced by a more pessimistic and almost dualistic view.66 The world is conceived as a vale of tears and the devil is a nearly equal antag- onist of the Lord. Rather than to give more examples of that kind I want to draw attention to one more puzzle connected with the problem of logodicy. The arguments used for the justification of the Cosmic Reason, etc., imply always a justification of evil, theologically speaking: theodicy is implicitly satanodicy. If we, e.g., assert that "all being is good", we can not label anything as bad; if the evil "has no real existence", it is hardly understandable why we should worry about a "non- being". Whether we now ascribe "goodness" to all things or deny the "reality" of the bad, in both cases these considerations are at least in principle able to destroy any moral order. They were, of course, not actually used for that pur- pose. Strong interests of human society make it impossible to defend a criminal lich ist, das ist vernuenftig in his edition of Hegels Philosophy of Right, Oxford 1949, p. 10: "What is rational is actual and what is actual is rational". His explanation in footnote 27 (p. 302) makes it perfectly clear that the distinction between "actuality" and "mere exist- ence" is based primarily on evaluations. Furthermore, it becomes obvious that the whole doctrine which postulates this distinction ultimately depends on the conviction that history or in general the universal process is the working out of the rational purpose of Providence and World-Reason. 64 J.

More serious are other deliberations often made in connection with our problem. Al- ready in the discussions of the Stoics it was emphasized that the divine power permits or effects evil in order to obtain valuable ends which we sometimes do not even know. From this kind of argumentation, which was preserved by the early Christian and Mediaeval philosophers, the principle that "the end sancti- fies the means" seems to be derived. That decried formula is not in every respect as bad as it sounds. Because the world is actually not a cosmos, morally demanded ends are often not attainable without the use of controversial means.66 Never- theless, real danger arises when an uncontrollable utopia placed in a nebulous future is the excuse for the violation of basic moral rules. Political leaders be- lieving- themselves to be tools of "historical providence" or "necessity" are rather inclined to discard any and every moral hesitation. In ordinary life, however, nobody is likely to approve crimes only because they may lead to a good result which is not known and perhaps can not be known. But this is exactly what the defenders of World-Reason do, although they do not like to admit it. The potential nihilism inherent in the concept of "cosmic justice" has to be stressed because there is a widespread belief that the cosmic ideology is the best bulwark against the alleged moral nihilism of our time and that therefore its restoration is highly desirable. Thus the deficiencies of the sociomorphic and technomorphic interpretation of the world become more and more obvious. If the alleged "Law of Reason" or "Nature" is conceived only as a prescription and directive, it yields but empty formulae which are compatible with every imaginable social and moral order. If it is regarded as the "supreme and unique power" in the universe, this as- sumption leads us in addition into insoluble contradictions. The problems be- come even more intricate if the relation between human action and the supposed cosmic agent is considered. Here lies one of the main roots of the age-old free-will problem. It is impossible to deal with all the ramifications and implications of that com- plex question within the limits of this paper. Unlike the former points in dispute, which were for the most part capable of clarification by merely analytical pro- cedures, the difficulties connected with so-called free will are rather a redoubtable imbroglio of most heterogeneous elements. Some of these puzzles are certainly pseudo-problems, others may have factual content but are not yet capable of scientific decision. Leaving them unsettled as they are I will make only a few remarks on the connections between the thought-patterns mentioned above and the question of free will.67 The classical Greek philosophers did not worry much about that problem. For them "freedom" meant in general the mastery over the passions, a kind of noble G 6H. Gomperz: "When does the end sanctify the means?", Philosophical Studies, Boston 1953, p. 182. 67 H.

The troubles arose when the Stoic philoso- phers concentrated all power in the hands of the cosmic agent, "Reason" or "Nature", because this idea came in conflict with its very prototype, conscious human action. The mutual interference between the activities of man and those of the Logos can be imagined in different ways. Either the World-Reason determines only the final outcome of human actions or it produces and effects human choices and decisions themselves as the wire-puller produces and effects the behavior of his puppets. The first way, generally known as fatalism, is philosophically less important. Its principle, "Men may do whatever they want but they can not escape their destiny," is tenable only as long as the real causal connections between an ac- tion and its final results are not known or are only partially known. Where these connections are perspicuous, there is no gap or dark spot left for an alleged en- croachment of a "finger of fate." It may not be an exaggeration to assert that causal analysis and prediction has relegated fatalism into the realm of super- stition. The matter seems to become a little more complicate if human choice itself is supposed to be "caused" by the cosmic agent-a doctrine which may be styled "deterministic" in the proper sense. But here, as in the previously mentioned cases, the process of reflection leads merely into empty formulae and pseudo- problems. Sentences like, e.g., "Through your actions the 'Reason of the Uni- verse' in its double function as 'teleological providence' and 'causal necessity' realizes itself", have no content whatsoever for the acting man. They tell him neither what he will do nor what he ought to do. Such expressions are empty from the factual as well as from the normative viewpoint and say in an ornate language no more than "You do what you do". Only ex post, when the actual decision has been made, the chosen possibility may be interpreted as causally or teleologically necessary. In order to get rid of these empty formulae and to make the free-will con- troversy capable of scientific solution-as far as the problems involved are scien- tific at all-we would have to deal with the question whether and in what degree human decisions can be predicted by the agent himself and by other persons. But investigations of that kind are extremely rare even in analytical philosophy to say nothing of the traditional approach, which handled the problem almost exclusively from the viewpoint of the interference between superhuman and human will. The questions chiefly at issue were traditionally whether the divine power is responsible for human actions, whether these actions are causally "necessitated", and whether there exists a providential "plan of history." It has been already emphasized that the problem of free will did not emerge from empirical considerations but from valuational postulates connected with the sociomorphic and technomorphic interpretation of the world. Such postulates are divine omnipotence and divine goodness, furthermore the alleged universal validity and iron necessity of the causal relations which were conceived as "ordinances and laws which God laid down in the universe as unalterable"68 68 H. A. Wolfson: "Philo on Free Will", Harvard Theological Review XXXV, 1942, p. 131.</page><page sequence="20">294 ERNST TOPITSCH and therefore as materializations and manifestations of the absolute divine power. Thus the cosmic agent can interfere with human will either directly or by virtue of the "natural causes" through which he effects his purpose in the universe. In the latter case the factual elements involved in the concept of causality are entirely adapted to the anthropomorphic and evaluative world-view. It is therefore not surprising that the free-will problem was almost exclusively treated as an issue between normative and valuational postulates which exclude each other by definition. The dignity of the cosmic agent was supposed to postu- late his omnipotence and "universal causality", but this assumption implied the authorship of and the responsibility for human conduct. Now an alternative arose. Either every action is good because it is effected by the divine power or some actions are bad. The first hypothesis gives, as shown above in the example "every being is good", no evaluation at all. The second forces us either to put the blame for human vice on the cosmic principle and to split it up into a good and evil potency or to restrict its power in favor of independent human choice. Thus the idea of free will is essentially a valuational postulate to save the immaculate goodness of the divine entity. It is obvious that these problems only appear if the existence of a cosmic agent is presupposed, in other words, only if human action as an explanatory model is projected into the universe and the concepts thus created are reapplied upon their archetype.69 A similar difficulty results from a parallel process of projection and reflection. In connection with the technomorphic interpretation of nature it is often as- sumed that the cause is something "active" which "produces" the "passive" effect. This symbolism of causal "coercion" may, speaking generally, be con- sidered as harmless. But it creates the delusive semblance of a metaphysical problem when it is applied on non-coerced volition or spontaneous effort. If we try to conceive such decisions and actions as causally conditioned and apply the symbolism of "active effort" and "passivity" we become involved in a most puzzling contradiction. To understand these actions as determined we must, according to that symbolism, consider them as passive or coerced; and yet, in themselves, they are unmistakably experienced as spontaneous. And evidently they cannot be passive and spontaneous at one and the same time. But this ap- parent contradiction arises merely out of the particular reflexive use of the an- thropomorphic model. If that symbolism is given up the difficulty vanishes al- together.70 Of incomparably greater practical importance is the use of purposive action as a paradigm in a significant part of philosophy of history. Unlike the older ideologies of cosmic design, those constructions stressed the idea of the uni- versal plan especially in connection with the fate of mankind. Historical events are regarded as a purposeful process leading to a goal of ultimate value, some- times as the self-realization of the absolute good. It does not make any decisive 69On the connections between free will and theodicy cf. F. Billicsich: Das Problem der Theodizee im philosophischen Denken des Abendlandes, Wien 1936. 70 H.

If the supposed "Law of History," etc., does not only consist of empty formu- lae which are compatible with any and every empirical fact, it must enable us to make concrete predictions. Let us assume for the moment and for the sake of argument only that such predictions were possible. In that case we have to face the double question of the relations between the foretold happenings and human action or evaluation. The predictible events can be influenced in different de- grees by our deliberate behavior. Some of them we are able to control almost un- restrictedly; others only to a certain extent, e.g., the length of our lifetime; others not at all, e.g., the movements of the solar system. How and in what degree the occurrence of a fact or of a group of facts depends on our decisions has, of course, from the systematic point of view not the slightest consequences for their evaluation. Above all, it is entirely arbitrary that something is valuable merely because it is inevitable. The troubles become even more serious if the ''necessary self-realization of the ultimate good in history" is supposed to yield directives for political action. Exactly so far as the future events are "neces- sarily predetermined" are they beyond the influence of our actions, and it is therefore meaningless to demand additionally that they should be achieved by human effort; conversely, exactly so far as those happenings can be influenced by actions and prescriptions are they not necessarily predetermined. These are the main difficulties of the idea that an alleged "Plan of History" could give ab- solute directives combined with a guarantee of victory for those who perform their "historical task."73 v Let us summarize. It can be shown that many of the problems and difficulties of traditional philosophy arose from strange circular reasoning. First, certain objects and regularities of nature were interpreted in terms of individual or collective human action, feeling, and decision. Thus concepts were formed like "celestial bodies observing rules of law or custom" or "causality" with the conno- tations of artificial "production" or even of "coercion". Then by a fundamentally important reflection, these concepts were reapplied to their archetypes, the social and technical activities of man. It was asserted, e.g., that the "law of the uni- verse" or the "cosmic order" is the supreme rule for human conduct and social organization, or that there is a cause "producing" or "enforcing" even actions and decisions which are unmistakably experienced as free from coercion. Further- more, I tried to show that these procedures generally lead into purely analytic propositions which are either "eternal truths" (veritgs eternelles) because they are 71 N.

These empty or self-contradictory formulae have, of course, no factual and/or normative content and therefore neither descriptive nor prescrip- tive meaning. But their systematic futility constitutes exactly their tremendous pragmatic power. Whereas real descriptive and normative systems are always exposed to disconfirmation and change, the empty formulae are precisely by virtue of their vacuity compatible with any and every experience and prescrip- tion and therefore absolutely safe and ideally suited for the building up of a "kingdom of eternal truths and values". On the other side, the contradictions may be declared as "eternal mysteries of Being", etc., whose solution is beyond the power of the ordinary scientific mind and requires a special kind of philosoph- ical reasoning. Or they are for the human intellect insoluble at all and their pur- pose is to teach humility in face of the superhuman majesty of the Universe. Considering all these facts, we may not be surprised by the towering success of the sociomorphic and technomorphic thought-patterns. University of Vienna Vienna, Austria</page></plain_text>
