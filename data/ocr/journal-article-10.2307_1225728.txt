Jurassic Park's breakthroughs in imaging technology and its global success are nicely elucidated through an appreciation of cognitive schemata. While Kantian philoso- phers and modern cognitivists hold that the mind employs schemata for every act of consciousness, they also distinguish between the many forms and combinations of schemata possible to each perceiver. All films cue viewers to apply schemata but with different perceptual, reflexive, and emotional effects. The production history of Jurassic Park (JP) reveals a conscious implementation of unique schematizing strategies by those making and marketing the film. Namely, the JP dinosaurs were animalized and placed in threat scenes, strategies that made the film cognitively accessible to a mass, global audience. Both these strategies are built on a general understanding of cognition/schemata. Because threat scenes and the process of animalizing are original concepts, some further discussion is necessary. The horror/thriller threat scene is a type of scene where characters are threat- ened by dangerous, largely offscreen forces. There is no more forceful example of the role of schemata in film than the recognition of active offscreen space and no more elaborate activator of offscreen space than the threat scene: offscreen space and the threats that reside there can only exist as schemata in the viewer's mind. Threat scenes evoke viewer imagination as powerfully as any work of art. While silent cinema depicted numerous threatened characters and the early 1930s wit- nessed a boom in horror films, it was not until Val Lewton and his RKO unit began experimenting with low-budget horror pictures in the early 1940s that the modern threat scene was formalized, even institutionalized. That is, Lewton was the first to fully grasp and build on the power of offscreen space and horrific suggestion in sound cinema. In a series of films beginning with Cat People (1941), Lewton and company exhaustively explored manipulations of sound, editing, and offscreen space to generate unease, fear, and even startle reflexes in spectators.' Today, threat scenes are common, even expected of horror, thriller, and science fiction narratives, whether on the big screen, on television, at theme park venues like Disney's Alien Encounter, or on computer and television screens displaying the most popular titles in virtual gaming.

Many explanations have been offered to this question, but new, cognitive theories of the mind offer compelling insights. To begin, the mind is overwhelmingly and continuously devoted to monitoring space, and the major features of this spatial monitoring are extraconscious operation, running parallel with consciousness, through modular, encapsulated systems that are neurologically hard-wired to negative affects systems, predominantly fear and startle. Such a wonderfully adaptive and practical survival system can flounder on technologies of verisimilitude. Thus, a viewer can remain consciously aware of film artifice even as spatial intelligence operates naively. Much of new cognitive film theory embraces earlier intuitions-evident in nineteenth-century faculty psychology and then Freudianism-that the mind gen- erates multiple perceptions, feelings, and thoughts that are frequently at odds with one another. Thus, many cognitivists speak of multiple intelligences, as does Howard Gardner, who, in a series of major books, lays claim to seven distinct forms of human intelligence: linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, visual-spa- tial, bodily-kinesthetic, intrapersonal, and interpersonal. Each intelligence uses different types of schemata, with visual-spatial intelligence just as committed to imaginative and abstract extrapolation as, say, musical intelligence. This is because the navigation of real and virtual space requires extraperceptual inferences: sche- matic extensions of the directly perceived. And so visual arts such as magic, cin- ema, sculpture, and painting are built on an ability to elaborate beyond the given. Piaget is famous for isolating a universal cognitive ability in infants he termed "object permanence." Through numerous studies still being refined, it appears infants must develop the ability to imagine the continued existence of an object beyond direct perception. We see through a glass, and darkly, and only the pieces, parts, and sides of things. The wholeness of the world comes from schemata. Not surprisingly, the greatest confusion between the real and the artificial occurs in the imagination, where inferences of the fictional offscreen and the extraperceptual real comingle.' Philosophically and theoretically, this analysis rejects absolute relativism and cultural constructionism and grapples with the more intellectually sustainable and interesting intuition that humans share general physiological and psychological systems, which then enable and constrain unique combinations of experience through particular legacies of culture, history, identity. As David Bordwell and Noel Carroll have compellingly argued, film viewers almost certainly share basic cognitive capacities or, as Bordwell refers to them, contingent universals." The function of schemata (particularly what schemata allow-imagination and abstrac- tion) is the contingent universal of human cognition, a shared function that, in practice, individualizes through cultural and personal contexts. Contemporary models of cognition are fully compatible with, actually built on, the expectation of individuality, environmental influence, and neurological "plasticity," but they check the absurdity of absolute relativism by insisting on the Cinema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998 83</page><page sequence="3">presence of general psychological functions, shared environmental forces, and basic neurological architectures. A classic model of this approach is Brent Berlin and Paul Kay's Basic Color Terms. Berlin and Kay asked people to match the basic color terms in their native languages to the best examples from a chart containing 329 color chips. The results showed a shared perceptual response across cultures to "pure hues" and the "foci" of colors. Important cultural differences remained: some languages had words for as few as two basic colors while most had eleven. These cultural differences, taken together, formed a larger pattern: "(1) All lan- guages contain terms for white and black; (2) If a language contains three terms, then it contains a term for red," and so on. In all, seven "rules" seemed to guide the way different languages divided the color spectrum into basic color terms, so much so that the 2,048 possible combinations of eleven basic colors formed only twenty-two cultural arrangements.4 In another area of cognition directly relevant to this study, anthropologist Edward T. Hall argues that the social behavior of individuals reveals the operation of intimate, personal, social, and public spatial envelopes. Humans share this ba- sic, largely extraconscious sensitivity to surrounding space, yet exhibit diverse per- sonal and cultural variations. For instance, Spaniards and Arabs frequently converse and move about in closer proximity to one another than Americans and Germans do. Cultural differences in expectations of personal space result in American tour- ists in Madrid who find Spaniards intrusive and Arabs visiting Berlin with a sense that the natives are aloof and snobbish. The extraconscious regulation of these spatial envelopes led Hall to title his book The Hidden Dimension: Differences in the zones-in fact their very existence-became apparent only when Americans began interacting with foreigners who organize their senses differently so that what was intimate in one culture might be personal or even public in another. Thus for the first time the American became aware of his own spatial envelopes, which he had previously taken for granted.5 How could people be aware of something they seemingly aren't aware of? Easily, if awareness is not merely a language-based system but is also a tool of other, multiple intelligences not readily verbalized. If people learn bodily-kines- thetic schemata through social interactions, then it will not be surprising to dis- cover predictable behaviors arising outside reflective deliberation. Recent work with spatial envelopes expose contingencies of gender, occupa- tion, and contextual awareness to this cognitive universal. Some women experience greater discomfort during "interpersonal closeness" under reduced lighting condi- tions than under brighter lighting.' In another study, people asked to sit by persons described as either nonoffenders, nonviolent offenders, or violent offenders main- tain increasingly larger buffer zones for each of the three categories, with the largest leeway given to the violent offenders.7 Other evidence suggests that police officers maintain a "narrower interpersonal distance than nonofficers" with other persons. In addition, when asked to interpret an officer/citizen interaction on videotape, po- lice officers view a citizen's attempts to reestablish greater personal space as evi- dence of suspicious behavior, while nonofficers are less likely to do so." 84 Cinema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998</page><page sequence="4">Other fields committed to understanding the contingency of universals are genetics and immunology. Social psychologists John Tooby and Leda Cosmides reconcile "the Universality of Human Nature" with the "Uniqueness of the Indi- vidual" by linking current knowledge of the immune system with Chomsky's propo- sition that the mind begins with "mental organs" devoted to specific functions. Theirs is no crude genetic determinism. The authors see in human physiology a system with an "overall potential functional architecture" alongside a "sea of unco- ordinated protein variation." Following the insights of Nobel laureate Niels Jerne (who believed the immune system a literal analog to human cognition), Tooby and Cosmides hold, There are no substantive reasons to suspect that the kinds of evolutionary forces that shaped our innate psychological mechanisms are fundamentally different from those that shaped our innate physiology. ... Of course there can be individual variation in cognitive programs, just as there is individual variation in the size and shape of stom- achs. This can be true of any structure or process in a sexually recombining species, and such genetic variation constitutes the basis for inherited psychological differences. But even relatively simple cognitive programs or "mental organs" must contain a large num- ber of interdependent processing steps, limiting the nature of the variation that can exist without violating the functional integrity of psychological adaptation. Thus, per- sonality variation is not likely to consist of an alternative, wholly different, coordinated design that differs "from the ground up."9 Some cognitive universals seem more obvious than others. Bordwell men- tions likely ones in vision: the assumption of a three-dimensional environment; sensitivity to movement; and the perceptual expectation that natural light falls from above.'0 Bordwell's most careful explication of a film-based "contingent uni- versal" centers on the shot/reverse shot pattern, which is seen not as an utterly random imposition of Hollywood film practice but as a cultural convention that conforms to recurring features of the human body and terrestrial space: the core assumption here is that given certain uniformities in the environment across cultures, humans have in their social activities faced comparable tasks in surviving and creating their ways of life. Neither wholly "natural" nor wholly "cultural," these sorts of contingent universals are good candidates for being at least partly responsible for the "naturalness" of artistic conventions." Bordwell is making the point-apparently lost on or threatening to cultural relativists-that "it is perfectly possible for a phenomenon to be culturally con- structed and at the same time to be very widespread, or even universal, among human societies."'2 Schemata have an impressive pedigree and address a significant philosophical question: what is the linkage between the outer and inner worlds, between objec- tive reality and the mind? Plato's idealforms and Kant's twelve categories of thought were the most famous early theories that addressed this ultimate epistemological question. The first modern advocate of schemata is typically recognized as Sir Frederic Bartlett, whose Remembering (1932) impressively implicated the pres- ence of schemata by revealing that memory is systematically reconstructive. Cinema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998 85</page><page sequence="5">Bartlett had friends and acquaintances read, most famously, a North Pacific Indian folk tale-"The War of the Ghosts"-and then questioned them hours, days, months, even years later. Bartlett noticed that misremembering exhibited patterns of normalization, simplification, and rationalization, typically of the most alien, non-Western elements of the tale (Bartlett's subjects were largely of the British middle class). Mistakes of recall did not exhibit randomness, relativity, or subjectivism but what appeared to be default, ingrained generalizations (sche- mata) that filled gaps in knowledge with high-probability assumptions. For ex- ample, "canoes" became "boats," foreign words were simplified or omitted, and supernatural elements were entirely dropped or framed within Christian belief. Bartlett later showed, during a series of Royal Institution lectures conducted in 1948, that immediate reality could be dominated by background schemata. A series of phrases were briefly displayed to a group of people who were asked to record what they saw. What the 140 respondents actually saw and what they thought they saw differed considerably. Shown All is not gild that glotters; Talcer Powdum; The Royal Intuition; Fish and Chops. ... 3 correctly reported All is not gild that glotters, 54 reported All is not gold that glitters, and the remaining ones reported other inaccurate variations; 33 reported Talcer Powdum, and 65 of the others gave Talcum Powder as the original; 5 returned The Royal Intuition, and 103 The Royal Institution; 28 gave Fish and Chops, 97 Fish and Chips. Familiar and remembered forms are obviously overpowering the immediate work of the eyes.13 The results are compatible with both biological universals and cultural and personal uniqueness. Culturally and historically, All is not gild that glotters was readily misremembered, in part, because it was a sly deformation of a deeply in- grained linguistic phrase familiar to most every British citizen of the period. Like- wise, the absurdity Glottering gild powerfully cued Shakespeare's glittering gold, while Fish and Chops cued for another stereotypically British phrase. Chomsky also trafficked in absurd sentences that revealed a kind of sense: Colorless green ideas sleep furiously. But that was a mere laboratory sample com- pared to Lewis Carroll's treatise on the Jaberwocky, "Twas brillig, and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe." To cognitive linguist Steven Pinker, "English speakers recognize that they [these absurdities] are grammatical, and their mental rules allow them to extract precise, though abstract, frameworks of meaning."'14 These absurd passages make some kind of sense because they con- tinue to activate very abstract schemata-of sentence structure and word form. Importantly, this matching up of sensation to schemata occurs regardless of one's intention and can, through the schemata's affective timbre, influence emotional states. Schemata activation occurs across different types of cues and can, in the parallel mind, lead to partial confusion between a verbal "rose," a word "rose," a photographic "rose," and a real "rose." It is the largely identical activation of 86 Cinema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998</page><page sequence="6">similar (deep structure) schemata clusters to real and artificial cues, and to di- rectly perceived and imagined objects, that gives fictional and virtual space its phenomenological depth and intensity. Since Bartlett's early work, hundreds of scientists and theorists have worked with schemata. Of these various formulations I most like the recent, profoundly Kantian work of Mark Johnson, whose The Body in the Mind distinguishes be- tween "image schemata" and "mental pictures." Built on empirical and theoreti- cal work from the likes of John Anderson, Ulric Neisser, and George Lakoff, Johnson argues that "image schemata" are "structures that organize our mental representations at a level more general and abstract than that at which we form particular mental images."'" Further, they "have a certain kinesthetic charac- ter-they are not tied to any single perceptual modality. "16 Johnson offers an explication and far-reaching claim: in order for us to have meaningful, connected experiences that we can comprehend and reason about, there must be pattern and order to our actions, perceptions, and conceptions. A schemata is a recurrent pattern, shape, and regularity in, or of these ongoing ordering activities. These patterns emerge as meaningful structures for us chiefly at the level of our bodily movements through space, our manipulation of objects, and our perceptual interactions.1" The heart of Johnson's claim is that "our schemata for spatial and temporal orientation are so pervasive and so constitutive of our ordinary experience that they are taken for granted (and thus overlooked) in standard accounts of meaning and understanding."'8 Crucial to this model of schemata is the driving force of an active imagination, an imagination not limited to the popular and Romantic con- notations of "artistic creativity, fantasy, and fiction .... For Kant," Johnson re- minds us, "imagination is the very means by which we have any comprehensible structure in our experience."19 Johnson is quite right in following Kant's insistence that the imagination is an essential and constant aspect of human thought, and right to bridle at delegating it only to matters of art and creativity, but it would be wrong to deny or even underplay the way that art and fiction amplify the natural tendencies of the imagi- nation. Intuitively and empirically, artists are, whether they've read him or not, Kantians, careful students of the imagination. Their artworks expose, exaggerate, and elaborate underlying schemata and inspire contemplation of perception and emotional engagement. To make and view art is to take time and provide space for playful, reflective, experimental cognition. In this vein, cognitive film theorist Joseph Anderson sees the filmmaker as a programmer who develops a program to run on a computer that he does not under- stand and whose operating systems were designed for another purpose. ... He tests the outcome (that is, how the program will be handled in the mind of a viewer) by becoming a viewer himself and running the program in his own mind. This is a fairly risky proce- dure, because each human mind is different, and different sub-routines may be initiated by the same instruction, and different meanings may be constructed in each mind. But the filmmaker-turned-viewer is not proceeding completely recklessly and irresponsibly, Cinema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998 87</page><page sequence="7">because the "hardware" of the mind, the brain along with its sensory modules, is stan- dard. The same model with only minor variations is issued to everybody."2 In composition class this is called anticipating one's audience, an effect writ- ers may or may not achieve, and with audiences wide or specialized. Many artists create for highly specialized audiences. Others, however, work from a remarkable sense of how various formal arrangements anticipate mass response. In popular cinema, Steven Spielberg has shown unprecedented sophistication in creating film structures that anticipate mass, even global schemata protocols. In doing so he has been the foremost author of the modern blockbuster. Many in film studies view blockbuster success as a result of the sheer force of capital investment and mass marketing, the global imposition of a Hollywood jug- gernaut of influence and technology. But I see in successful blockbusters a thought- ful anticipation of human cognition and emotion. Mass investment and marketing are essential to the blockbuster, shared by attendance failures like Last Action Hero and successes like Independence Day-popular success, though, hinges on staging film scenes and narratives that can play to mass, global cognition. Addi- tionally, unlike other film types, successful blockbusters require the presence of something new and out of the ordinary, an element that brings viewers into the theater to witness an event, typically a "breakthrough" in special effects technol- ogy (E. T., JP, Independence Day). Less frequently, blockbusters offer a significant updating and combination of genre formulas, as in Raiders of the Lost Ark and Batman. And, of course, it never hurts for a blockbuster to excel in the traditional virtues of story, acting, and theme or in the formal film systems of editing, music, lighting, as in Jaws and The Exorcist. The assertion is not merely that the making of and viewing of JP involved human cognition (all films claim as much); rather, the assertion is that JP's marketing, manufacture, and reception hinged upon par- ticular cognitive philosophies and strategies initiated by Spielberg and his fellow filmmakers. Ultimately, this analysis challenges the assumptions that blockbusters are artless and "mindless," that economics alone determine the success of block- busters, and that viewers from diverse cultures understand and experience similar films in wholly different ways. Blockbusters are artful, intelligent, and globally successful when they make a spectacle of cognition. With the rapid development of multiplex theaters and home video in Europe and the Far East, and the concurrent advances in advertising and marketing, one can readily foresee the "global release" of calculated blockbusters far beyond the scale of a Batman or Terminator 2. -Thomas Schatz prophesying the coming of JP" "Billion Dollar Dinos' Merchandising Mania." JP remains one of the most globally successful films in history. Because I believe the magnitude and extent of this international success implies some similarities in cross-cultural spectator response, a brief recounting of the distribution and reception figures ofJP are in order. In Britain, the film set a three-day opening record. In Pakistan and India, JP did better there than any Western film in history. The scope of JP's success in 88 Cinema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998</page><page sequence="8">India can be appreciated by comparing the film's 5.8-million-dollar earnings on 110 prints against the typical profit of an American blockbuster in that country, usually around only $140,000. By October 1993, the film had set all-time box office records in Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and Thailand. The film built on a greater than usual commitment to the particular marketing and distribution needs of diverse countries. JP was the first American release since Gandhi to be dubbed into Hindi (eighty-two prints) for the Pakistani and Indian audiences. In Japan, Panasonic promoted the film in every one of its 24,000 electronic stores. A Variety writer summed it all up: "no single film has ever generated so much money, so fast. It has become an industry unto itself.""22 Although millions of dollars were spent marketing JP around the globe, a Variety reporter characterized the job of marketing the film in western Europe as a "no-brainer.""23 Hy Smith, head of marketing for Universal International Pic- tures, admitted that, in Britain, JP "nearly sold itself.""24 Indeed, JP enjoyed so much free publicity from licensed sponsors-over five thousand products from five hundred licensees for $1 billion in sales-and from interested media sources that actual outlays for marketing paled by comparison. In America, it was esti- mated that direct marketing costs were only $20 million but that indirect, "free" advertising exceeded $60 million.25 In Britain, just two weeks before JP's mid- July opening, the promotional wave hit a peak, resulting in polling figures for "awareness" (91 percent) and "definite interest" (55 percent) "never seen be- fore."26 Nine months after the film's American release, Advertising Age named Amblin Entertainment and MCA/Universal "Promotional Marketer of the Year," praisingJP for "transcend[ing] language and cultural barriers"--the trade publi- cation prophesying that the film would "be remembered for breaking down geo- graphic boundaries to entertainment promotions."27 The desire to make a profit (an eternal wish of all film investors and promot- ers) cannot explain the bandwagon effect seen in the marketing, advertising, and reception of JP. Domestically, only a minority of blockbusters inspire the band- wagon effect; globally, only a handful. To fully appreciate how these few films reach mass, global audiences involves delving more deeply into current thinking about the blockbuster. The two best studies of blockbusters are Tom Schatz's work on New Hollywood and Justin Wyatt's analysis of high concept. Both studies lead inevitably to the gen- eral thesis endorsed here: that blockbusters strive toward and, when successful, achieve a unified and consistent manipulation of deep, mass, and cross-cultural sche- mata across various perceptual domains. This is, of course, simply a cognitive-framed restatement of Wyatt's position that the high in high concept refers not to high art but to a film's high visibility, memorability, and simplicity. From the perspective of marketing, the rhyming mantra of high concept is the look, the hook, and the book, specifically, "the look of the images, the marketing hooks, and the reduced narra- tives.""2 To date, JP offers the perfect case study of high concept cognition, from the ubiquitous T rex logo, to the consistent red and yellow, primitive lettering of JP's promotional material, to Crichton's "presold" (i.e., successful and known) novel. Cinema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998 89</page><page sequence="9">In the early pages of High Concept, Wyatt invokes a famous comment by Spielberg: "if a person can tell me the idea in 25 words or less, it's going to make a pretty good movie. I like ideas, especially movie ideas, that you can hold in your hand.""29 Where Wyatt traces high concept through Spielberg, Schatz traces New Hollywood through Spielberg. "If any film marked the arrival of the New Holly- wood," says Schatz, "it was Jaws, the Spielberg-directed thriller that recalibrated the profit potential of the Hollywood hit, and redefined its status as a marketable commodity and cultural phenomenon as well." Jaws, Schatz notes, developed out of earlier horror successes like Psycho and Rosemary's Baby, which "proved that horror thrillers [and threat scenes] could attain hit status." Refinements continued with The Exorcist, "perhaps the clearest indication of the emergent New Holly- wood.""13 While The Exorcist made $86 million in 1973, Jaws set records two years later by grossing $102.5 million. To Schatz, "hype and promotion aside, Jaws' suc- cess ultimately centered on the appeal of the film itself; one enduring verity in the movie business is that, whatever the marketing efforts, only positive audience re- sponse and favorable word-of-mouth can propel a film to genuine hit status."31 What else do successful blockbusters share besides positive response and word- of-mouth? Most of the top fifty all-time highest-grossing domestic films incorpo- rate threat scenes and special effects spectacles or count Spielberg in their credits.32 Successful blockbusters are like one another in that they develop scene types and narrative formulas capable of evoking mass and cross-cultural cognitions. This is why genre films, threat scenes, and effects spectacles dominate. Threat scenes are built on the most universal of narratives, the fight-or-flight scenario. Special effects spectacles achieve a cognitive universality in a much more roundabout manner: they impose on their audience an immediate, direct, and unambiguous message, not, however, a fundamentally linguistic or social one but a phenomenological experi- ence. Successful blockbusters carry their own unique, immediately comprehensible phenomenological "language." Beyond a shared ability to anticipate and deliver cross-cultural cognitions, a blockbuster must offer something unique or timely to achieve mass popularity. That is, simple communicability is not enough. A block- buster must inspire theatrical attendance even by those who rarely attend screenings in an age of video, cable, and broadcast exhibition. Jaws, for instance, was a formally graceful, well-acted, terse satire of community boosterism and capitalism run amok. These qualities no doubt contributed to the film's run, but Jaws' originality (unique- ness to a mass audience) likely derived from breakthroughs in special effects technol- ogy, breakthroughs that helped dramatize the shark better than any film in history. Blockbusters become "must-sees" primarily for their special effects: the surreal vio- lations of physics and the body depicted in The Exorcist's possession scenes; the tor- nadic meteorology and carnage of Twister; Independence Day's updating of apocalyptic destruction of whole cities and the sublime, city-covering shadows of the alien vessels. With JP, interest was driven by an idea, confirmed throughout produc- tion and by word-of-mouth in the opening weeks of release, that Spielberg and his crew were stocking the screen with unprecedented, "living" dinosaurs. Thus, seeing JP became more than just another trip to the theater; it became a pilgrimage to an "event" and a front-seat view to a technological breakthrough. 90 Cinema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998</page><page sequence="10">They're the best dinosaurs people have ever made, period. -Jack Horner, paleontologist and JP advisor33 Animalizing Dinosaurs for Global Threats. Although the making-of tale of JP's dinosaurs has been told in numerous contexts (in everything from Cinefex to Newsweek), the story has yet to be covered self-consciously as an endeavor driven by basic cognition. Where others have powered this tale of production with Spielbergian genius, evolutionary bursts in software and hardware design, collec- tive effort and individual epiphanies, effects department rivalries, paleontological expertise, and X-generation hacker chutzpah, I will argue that all of these forces were secondary responses to Spielberg's admonition to surpass all previous films and create "living" dinosaurs by relying on shared assumptions of animal form, movement, and behavior. The dinosaurs of JP are seamless composites of full- scale, motion-controlled models and computer-generated images. Special effects expert Stan Winston was responsible for the live-action models. Dennis Muren headed up the massive crew from ILM who were responsible for developing com- puter dinosaurs. The people behindJP--including author Michael Crichton-con- sciously sought to represent dinosaurs in light of the latest scientific thinking. Given past examples of Hollywood's relations with historians and scientists, JP seems to have been quite successful in dramatizing the reigning conceptions of dinosaurs. But the issue is not whether JP's dinosaurs are consistent with current scientific knowledge. The JP dinosaurs, regardless of their paleontological accuracy, are true to schemata derived from real, contemporary animals. Before JP, the primary way of depicting dinosaurs in live-action movies was to film small-scale models through stop-motion or, alternately, "small-scale" liv- ing reptiles. Both stop-motion models and live animals were filmed on scaled sets, where waist-high palms and volcanoes would appear, through trick perspec- tive, to tower above the camera. Stop-motion artists like Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen are justly famous for developing this art form to its fullest potential. Yet no matter how expressive stop-motion animation, the technique always has, as one critic complained, a "familiar jerky, almost pixilated, look" (although in the context of a film like Tim Burton's The Nightmare before Christmas this can be a definite virtue). But scale models also lack the details of texture, light, and shadow intuitively recognized in full-scale objects. The record shows that Spielberg insisted (and had the wisdom, money, and clout to insure) that JP would eventu- ally offer more realistic dinosaurs. Such a breakthrough required new technolo- gies but, more importantly, a more sophisticated understanding of basic cognition. For three years and in every effects technology, JP filmmakers followed a phi- losophy of animalizing dinosaurs. Production designer Rick Carter explains, "What we tried to do was find the animal in the dinosaur as opposed to the monster in the dinosaur. The idea was not to make them any less threatening, but rather to keep them from doing as much monster 'schtick."'34 Spielberg, of course, was the most explicit on this philosophy: "I wanted my dinosaurs to be animals. I wouldn't even let anyone call them monsters or creatures. What I was after was kind of like Nova meets Explorer, with a little bit of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jaws mixed in."35 Cinema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998 91</page><page sequence="11">The JP cribbing from real animals was extensive and orchestrated, and it in- fused all areas of production. Effects expert Phil Tippett took his role as dinosaur specialist and instructor of organic motion seriously and instituted daily mime classes with Leonard Pitt and visits to wild animal parks, zoos, and Marine World USA. The thinking, according to Tippett, was to give effects personnel "hands-on expe- rience with animals that have similarities to dinosaurs: large flightless birds, gi- raffes, rhinos and elephants."36Video footage of animals was used extensively: "we set about poring over all kinds of nature documentaries and films and breaking them down frame by frame-looking at how certain birds move, studying elephants and so forth, so that we had a really solid understanding of animal movement.""3 The overall strategy was probably best explicated by Stan Winston: You look at a Triceratops, and say, this animal could in some way relate to a rhinoceros. You look at amphibians, you look at reptiles, you look at mammals and at birds, take all that information in hand, and then you make aesthetic choices. Nobody can look at you and say, scientifically, that it's the wrong color or skin texture. It's a matter of looking at it and going, does this feel right? Does it feel real, does it look real, is it dramatic? And where does that come from? Instinct.3 With instinct, Winston is probably reaching for a folk term that economically describes the kind of extraconscious cognitive inferences (schemata) people em- ploy. Schemata, even animal schemata, need not come from pristine nature or di- rect experience. Most who live in big cities learn animal schemata primarily through mediated experience: the PBS Nature series, National Geographic, Free Willy, Disney. One would assume there are three general categories of schemata involved in recognizing, say, an elephant. At the most abstract level there are species-spe- cific schemata that help one recognize every possible and potential instance of elephantness. More broadly, there are schemata associated with and applicable to all large animals. These schemata are the ones that contribute strongly to a spectator's sense of verisimilitude and provide for comparative assumptions by those who encounter new animals. Third, there are schemata associated with various cul- tural representations of elephants from language, art, and design. (Elephant train- ers, zoologists, and wildlife artists might utilize a fourth category, individuating schemata, which allow one to recognize elephant types and individuals.) Ultimately, all these schemata work together so that even radical artistic deformations (say, a two-dimensional Art Deco elephant cast in steel) evoke something of the primary schemata and their associations with lived experience. In addition, JP embellishes its sense of verisimilitude by mimicking the form and appearance of the wildlife documentary. In the Brachiosaurus scene, a herd of (digital) dinosaurs drink at a small lake. The subject is herding, the passive intermin- gling of species, birds flocking around larger animals-even such subtleties as nonpredatory animals using defensive behavior (scanning the horizon between quick drinks of water). The image relies on the visual properties of a high-power telephoto lens, which squeezes foreground and background together and accentu- ates the effect of haze between the viewer and distant objects. Nature documenta- ries, of course, frequently rely on telephoto footage to get close to wild animals and to avoid disturbing their behavior, a visual convention JP subtly echoes. 92 Cinema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998</page><page sequence="12">Schemata are easiest to grasp as iconic, frozen mental pictures, but cognitive theorists like Ulric Neisser and Mark Johnson are quick to remind us that many schemata exist as temporal and three-dimensional structures. People have a sense of the appearance of general animal motion and how this differs from a general mechanical motion. Aware of this, JP filmmakers designed new robotics for the full-scale mechanical dinosaurs used on the film, the largest of which was the forty- foot, nine-thousand-pound T rex. Basically a carefully designed latex skin over a graphite frame of interlocking hydraulic articulations, the T rex relied on animatronic principles as old as Disneyland. Stan Winston knew, though, that the large size and weight of the full-scale T rex would only accentuate the "robotic jerkiness that you usually see with animatronic characters" and destroy the illusion of dynamic "fluidity" and "organic" motion.39 Large movements of animatronic fig- ures also tend to end in "waga-waga"-shop slang for awkward and unrealistic quivering. Winston overcame jerkiness and waga-waga by designing "intricate ramp- up/ramp-down computer cards, so that the speed would not come to an [abrupt] stop, but automatically slow down a little near the end of its movement and pick up speed at the beginning of its movement."40 These computer cards were linked to small computer chips located throughout the mechanical anatomy of the T. rex, providing information on the speed and velocity of each segment at any instant (a mechanism that better imitated the appearance of fluid mammalian movement). In the digital realm, the illusion of organic motion and texture came from a variety of adapted and off-the-shelf animation software wielded by ILM animators who spent months working on millions of dollars' worth of Silicon Graphics work- stations. Digitally scanning highly detailed dinosaur models with lasers, the com- puter animators loaded the dinosaur forms into their computers. Early motion studies were accomplished with wireframe virtual models. Skin was added with 3- D Paint software, and a second layer of wrinkles was added to this, giving, for example, "the correct elephantlike skin for the rex."41 The elephant model sug- gested another effect, the jiggle of loose skin with movement. Animator Steve Williams explains the process used: we covered it [the virtual skin] with a whole bunch of invisible points and cross-sec- tions, and we actually inserted little spheres under the skin that shook and shimmered whenever the dinosaur took a step. Each point, cross-section and sphere had a name and address, so a sphere in quadrant five on the leg muscle knows to talk to point num- ber 18 on the skin over the kneecap. That way, when the sphere on the leg shimmered at every step, the skin over the kneecap oscillated just a little as well.42 For the impressive scene where a group of Gallimimus run past Doctor Grant, Tim, and Lex, animators created movement cycles (basically visual loops of mo- tion) by freeze-framing ostrich footage on a video monitor and tracing cels directly from the screen; other references were the stampede scene from King Solomon's Mines and documentary footage of herding gazelles.43 At Spielberg's urging, JP sound designer Gary Rydstrom used only animal sounds to construct the JP dinosaur vocalizations. Rydstrom visited various local exotic animal habitats, including Marine World, the San Francisco Zoo, and a "lion- Cinema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998 93</page><page sequence="13">Table 1.

Rydstrom recorded a menagerie of animal sounds: geese, wal- ruses, parrots, cranes, horses, foxes, alligators, tigers, lions, elephants, dolphins, whales, egrets, donkeys, mating tortoises, a tarantula, an "exotic insect" for the cowl shake of the Dilophosaur, various animals being castrated and branded, and, for good measure, Rydstrom's pet dog and a close friend who provided a "throaty clicking sound" that, when slowed down, "was very interesting and guttural.'44 In the end, the animalizing strategy paid off. Viewers and critics around the world reported strong impressions of verisimilitude and emotional engagement. In a way, the animalizing strategy was stunningly simplistic; dinosaurs were ani- mals after all. What counts at last, though, is execution. The JP filmmakers had to control the animalizing process, arranging and combining cues in order to avoid evoking human schemata (anthropomorphism) or those of a particular animal (Triceratops as puppy dog), or mechanical ones (waga-waga), or monster cues (see Carnosaur). Where the film does evoke a particular animal species, as in the Gallimimus as ostrich, it does so explicitly, asserting its paleontology in the dia- logue and, ultimately, in its final images, where the pelican flying beside the JP helicopter asserts the film's dinosaurs-into-birds thesis and reminds viewers that they've just seen a wildlife documentary, of sorts: "kind of like Nova meets Ex- plorer, with a little bit of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jaws mixed in." The Age of the Threat Scene in JP. Although Spielberg insisted that no one on the film call the dinosaurs "monsters," and others on the film denied making a dinosaur "slasher film," the use of well-crafted threat scenes insured that JP's di- nosaurs would ultimately behave something like the creatures of horror films. Consequently, for all its memorable and highly visible animatronics and computer animation, JP, more often than not, suggests its threatening dinosaurs. By relying on the threat scene and its inducements to suggestion, Spielberg was able to link state-of-the-art film effects with the most dynamic multimedia system we know: the schemata-wielding human mind. Table 1, based on judgments of suggestive or 94 Cinema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998</page><page sequence="14">explicit depiction derived from shot-by-shot analysis, offers some indication ofJP's commitment to suggestion. Combining totals for the 126-minute-long movie means that threatening dinosaurs were explicitly depicted for only 8 minutes and 36 sec- onds, while they were offscreen or significantly occluded through masking or me- tonymy for 26 minutes and 48 seconds. Converted to percentages, the threatening dinosaurs of JP were fully revealed onscreen for about 6 percent of the film but were suggestively presented for about 21 percent of the time. Given that dino- saurs are, by most anyone's account, the primary element of interest inJP, Spielberg's use of suggestion and his willingness to temper the industrial light and magic at his command reflect a mature appreciation of the "viewer's share" in imagining art. The film's early structure takes full advantage of spectator curiosity, patience, and cognitive tendency to apply multiple schemata to limited and inconclusive information. There are five scenes in the opening that simply tease viewers: the opening "zoo-handler" accident with the Velociraptor; the scene where Dr. Grant narrates a story of Velociraptor hunting tactics to the impertinent little boy; the scene where the Velociraptors are fed but not seen; and the drive-bys of the empty Diloposaur and Tyrannosaurus cages. The first scene of the film is a classically constructed threat scene that, like the opening of Jaws, never fully reveals its ter- rible killer. From the moment that the dinosaur rushes the door of its cage to the final, last grasp, the attack totals only forty-five seconds. In that time the viewer is assaulted with twenty-three different shots, numerous rapid visual movements, and disturbingly loud sounds, a Jurassic Psycho shower scene. The next suggestive tease in the film comes when John Hammond brings Doctors Grant, Sattler, and Malcolm around the Velociraptor pen for feeding time. Viewers hear the Velociraptors devour a cow through the latest multitrack sound effects design. As feeding time continues, Muldoon arrives and is introduced to the park's new visitors, his warning fueling the viewer's horrifying projections: "they should all be destroyed . .. they show extreme intelligence ... when she looks at you, you can see she's working things out ... they remember." A point-of-view shot, like one used in the opening attack, places the viewer within the Velociraptors' space but without revealing them, while waving palm fronds nearly obstruct the disgusted reactions of the film's principal players, safe above on the viewing plat- form. When the mangled harness is extracted from the thick jungle of the cage (a wonderful horrific symptom), a range of disgusted and awed reaction shots em- phasizes what the viewer never saw. The reaction shot and the eyeline match of actors to offscreen horrors is used often in these opening suggestive scenes as well as throughout JP. Like the facial expressions of actors that helped make silent film a cross-cultural success, the block- buster devotes itself to the most basic of emotional expressions (fear, surprise, joy, anger). In the drive-bys of the empty T rex and Dilophosaurus cages the expectant characters eagerly scan the empty jungle, giving the viewer the chance to adopt the characters' emotional stance and imagine the absent dinosaurs. In the film's most intense and elaborate threat scenes, the attack of the T. rex on the tour ve- hicle and the Velociraptors' stalking of Tim and Lex in the park's industrial kitchen, reaction shots interlock with images of threats in a relentless pattern of threat/ Cinema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998 95</page><page sequence="15">reaction-shot/threat/reaction-shot. During the attack of the T rex, there are fif- teen shots that simply show either Tim, Lex, Dr. Grant, or Dr. Malcolm looking concerned, amazed, or horrified. The pattern is so repetitive that Spielberg and long-time editor Michael Kahn appear to have carefully staggered the reaction shots across all four characters to diminish the effect of the repetition. Another convention of the threat scene powerfully evokes viewer schemata. Doors are used throughout the film. In the JP kitchen, three doors wholly or par- tially obscure the dinosaurs from Tim, Lex, and the viewer, engaging viewer imagi- nation along with the mechanical and digital presentations of the Velociraptors. Later, the defense of the command center will hinge, so to speak, around barricad- ing and locking (via computer activation) the main door. It seems the Velociraptors have learned to open doors. Eight different shots of the raptors at the command center door are intercut with Lex's computer mousing and the adults' battle to block the portal. The highly suggestive and expressive shot of a claw bending around a nearly closed door is used four times in a row. Even before the kitchen scene, JP indulges itself in doors, including the shutting of the doors of the tour vehicle and the restroom during the T rex attack and Dr. Sattler's journey to the underground power station, where she uses the wire-cage door as a shield against the attacking raptor and then the exit door and an outside gate at the power station to seal, or so she hopes at the time, the Velociraptor inside. Like hundreds of horrifying films, JP stages suspense, surprise, and narrative complications around doors, a mecha- nism so ubiquitous even children are intimately familiar with it. Another cross-cultural cognition evoked inJP is the startle reflex, which is not only a human but a mammalian universal. In the bowels of the power station, with spectator attention drawn through cross-cutting to Tim, Lex, and Dr. Grant climb- ing over a soon-to-be reactivated electric fence, Spielberg mounts his most potent startle effect, the surprising burst of a Velociraptor through a wall. A second cross- cultural cognition (gore/disgust) is then deployed. After running away from the raptor to the security of "Mr. Arnold," Sattler discovers that "Mr. Arnold" is less of a man than she thought. Of allJP's elements, the startle effect and gore/disgust are truly the most global and cross-cultural, threat scene conventions founded on cog- nitive paradigms as old as the Jurassic age itself. Why Were a Billion People Staring at a Cup of Water in a Dinosaur Movie? The devilish genius of JP is in the way it activates offscreen space and evokes spectator schemata for negative affects. One of the richest uses of suggestion oc- curs when the escaped Tyrannosaurus threatens the film's principal characters as they wait beside its breached cage, stranded in automated Land Rovers. Fidgeting in one stalled Land Rover are Tim and Lex. They hear what sounds like distant thunder. Tim gazes entranced at a cup of water on the Land Rover's dashboard, shaking with the seismic vibrations of some great force. The Tyrannosaurus is out and about. Similar to the Styrofoam cup (a conception storyboarded long before shooting), two other props-a rear-view mirror and a water puddle-serve to evoke the offscreen Tyrannosaurus. The jeep's rear-view mirror is used to reflect the fear of the lawyer as it, too, vibrates from the impact tremors. The shot is arranged so 96 clnema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998</page><page sequence="16">that viewers see two images of the lawyer's face, one the mirror's reflection: a doubling of the facial expressiveness of fear. A third offscreen cue occurs when Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), injured while trying to distract the Tyrannosaurus from its assault on Tim and Lex, rests in a gas-powered jeep while Dr. Sattler and game warden Muldoon search for Dr. Grant, Tim, and Lex. Alone and immobile, Ian hears and feels the impact tremor of the offscreen Tyrannosaurus and looks down at the ground to confirm his fears. In a nice bit of irony, we see another vibrating body of water, this time held in the bottom of a Tyrannosaurus footprint. Two offscreen cues overlap (footprint, pool of water), both visualizing Ian's fearful reaction. This careful cueing of offscreen space, of character imagination, of sche- mata is a prime example of Spielberg's talent for collapsing a film's organizing principle (a high concept, held in one hand) into a single image or moment. Is the Blockbuster Spectacle Mindless? One does not need specialized train- ing or art appreciation classes to comprehend or enjoy blockbusters. But it is a mistake to assume that a lack of depth in the traditional dramatic verities (narra- tion, character, theme, style) implies a complete shallowness. The depth and intel- ligence of the blockbuster reside in other intelligences than the linguistic and the logical-mathematical. Blockbusters exercise and explore the bodily-kinesthetic, the visio-spatial, and the most archaic of inter- and intrapersonal expressions. There is a way in which blockbusters and threat scenes remind us that no one can ever really put away childish, archaic, and anarchic things. Alexander Sesonske reminds us, too, that narrative film exploits assumptions (schemata) largely derived from the experience of real space: Most of our talk about films concerns persons, objects, things-Ratso Rizzo, the Odessa steps, Claire's knee-talk which treats them as if they were real. But such objects are all spatial things, requiring three-dimensional space for their being. The casual familiarity of our talk about films reflects the degree to which we project into cinema's action- space the characteristics of the ordinary three-dimensional space in which we move. Perhaps the fact that the objects in a film are usually of a very familiar type-people, cats, cars-helps convince us; such ordinary things must inhabit an ordinary space.45 Blockbuster threat scenes are bold and dramatic reminders of a curious relation, still largely unfathomed, between mind and mimetic space. Too often, critics and academics sacrifice the richness of film space and spectator response to hermeneutical puzzle solving. Language can, with great ease, impose its own allegory on plastic and graphic arts, a maneuver criticized in Susan Sontag's famous screed "Against Interpretation" and in David Bordwell's Making Meaning. Once upon a time, Susan Langer sought to appreciate art's expressiveness.46 Now we "interrogate" art, a term ridiculously, vainly hyper- bolic, resulting in a practice that, more often than not, feeds critical hubris. Sontag proposed that artists could diminish the reductionism and final-word interpretations of critics by creating artworks that offered a "direct address." Cinema, Sontag claimed, was notable for its immediacy, and threat scenes cer- tainly achieve as direct an address as one is likely to find. Perhaps Steven J. Cinema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998 97</page><page sequence="17">Gould, oscillating between concerned paleontologist and ex-kid "dinosaur nut," probably best appreciated the direct address of JP: But let me not carp. The dinosaur scenes are spectacular. Intellectuals too often either pay no attention to such technical wizardry or, even worse, actually disdain special ef- fects with such dismissive epithets as "merely mechanical." I find such small-minded parochialism outrageous. Nothing can be more complex than a living organism, with all the fractal geometry of its form and behavior (compared with the almost childishly simple lines of our buildings, and of almost anything else in the realm of human con- struction). The use of technology to render accurate and believable animals therefore becomes one of the greatest, all-time challenges to human ingenuity ... and who would dare deny this story a place in the annals of human intellectual achievement.47 Although the cognitive arguments voiced here stand on their own, they do hint at other responses to sensational art, to the blockbuster, to Spielberg films, to the cognitive life of film spectators. The brief phenomenological interpretation offered below attempts to avoid the formulaic imposition of critical metanarratives onto original stories and to rise above a historical weakness of poetics. (How does one say anything about art without imposing a critical metanarrative onto the original narrative?) The following is an attempt at such a form of analysis. JP's cup supports an expansive motif of seismic vibration, established earlier in the desert scene where fossils are located by sending shock waves through the earth. Spielberg dramatically emphasizes the "shock value" of the shotgun-shell- powered earth-thumper as it is fired into the ground. All of which echoes symbolic tropes of dinosauria: the term "thunder lizard," Seismasaurus, the association of earthquakes and volcanoes with dinosaur life and extinction (found often in graphic representations of dinosaurs, the dinosaur sequence of Fantasia [1940], and Spielberg's own animated children's film Land before Time [1988], which stages the separation of child dinosaurs from parents around an "earth shake"). This motif assertively continues in the scene where the first living dinosaur, Brachiosaurus, is introduced. While the park's newcomers (and viewers) look on in awe, the massive dinosaur rises on her hind legs to feed at the very heights of a tree and returns to all-fours with a resonant boom. Sound effects are not alone in expressing the sen- sation; the JP filmmakers used computer animation to mimic "camera jiggle" here (i.e., the entire frame quivers slightly), an effect used elsewhere in the film. This manipulation plays on viewer knowledge, albeit extraconscious, derived from ex- perience with films, documentaries, and news programs. Recall, too, as described above, how the computer animators created "jiggle" in the "flesh" of the large dinosaurs (including swaying bellies), another extraconscious visual cue of mass movement. "The idea," said animator Mark Dippe, "is to work with gravity."48 A more current association is Lucas's own THX sound system, advertised before most screenings of JP and the video and laser discs with a brief clip that parades the system's thunderous potential by offering a rumbling crescendo of sound. This thunder-lizard motif is later evoked when the Land Rover (itself camouflaged ani- mal-like in yellows and greens) "roars" after Tim and Dr. Grant as it falls from a concrete wall and from its precarious perch in a massive tree. This, of course, 98 Cinema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998</page><page sequence="18">refers back (both intellectually and phenomenologically) to the opening scene where forklift, cage, and Velociraptor all shake the earth. Writing for Commonweal, Richard Alleva responded to this web of seismic sensationalism and associated it, as I am sure Spielberg intended, with monsters from our own world: But when I drove away from the theater it wasn't birds I was rediscovering. Instead, I found myself registering faint waves of unease each time I pulled in or out of the paths of trucks. The noise and power of rigs kept reminding me of what Spielberg had evoked on screen: not the strangeness of ancient animal life but the crushing mon- strosity of big machinery.49 This is not at all surprising given that Spielberg's Duel is a horror film about a semitruck, conveyed, very nearly, without any dialogue. How is the following different from mainstream criticism? For one, it identi- fies a web of associations between film, spectator phenomenology, and popular culture instead of imposing a metanarrative. It's not the only or best way to "read" films, but it's one that often gets neglected. More difficult, it is impossible, under current expectations in the field, to sustain a poetic (cognitive) reading for an en- tire essay. Indeed, new cognitive film theory has yet to establish a critical metanarrative capable of unlimited interpretive reproduction. In the end, this might be for the best. I am not claiming that blockbuster special effects are always profound or pro- found in the typical way that word is conceived. I simply second Howard Gardner's assertions that human intelligence is not a solely linguistic capacity and that infer- ences derived through art through other intelligences-spatial, kinesthetic-have their own depth, purpose, and place in criticism and academic analysis. Conclusion: The Return of the Cinematic Spectacular Sublime. In his famous "The Cinema of Attractions: Early Film, Its Spectator and the Avant-Garde," Tom Gunning adopted the phrase cinema of attractions to describe the pre-1906 film which "directly solicits spectator attention, inciting visual curiosity, and sup- plying pleasure through an exciting spectacle-a unique event, whether fictional or documentary, that is of interest itself."50 Gunning borrowed the term attrac- tions from Eisenstein, who used the word to designate films that "subjected the spectator to 'sensual or psychological impact."'1' Eisenstein understood attractions as, Gunning argues, "a term of the fairground, and for Eisenstein and his friend Yutkevich, it primarily represented their favorite fairground attraction, the roller coaster, or as it was known then in Russia, the American Mountains.""52 Gunning, however, does not limit his thesis to pre-1906 films and avant-garde works. He adds that "the system of attraction remains an essential part of popular film-mak- ing," and "clearly in some sense recent spectacle cinema has reaffirmed its roots in stimulus and carnival rides, in what might be called the Spielberg-Lucas-Coppola cinema of effects.""5 Gunning, however, following the academic film canon, places Soviet-era film and avant-garde work above (far above) big-budget American pro- ductions and then draws a distinction between the "Spielberg-Lucas-Coppola cin- ema of effects" and avant-garde and pre-1906 attractions by stating-no argument Cinema Journal 37, No.4, Summer 1998 99</page><page sequence="19">is made-that "effects are tamed attractions." Well, some effects-like exploding automobiles-have certainly been tamed through overuse, but JP's dinosaurs and Independence Day's hovering alien ships are, nearly one hundred years after the birth of cinema, powerful indicators that the attraction and sublimity of the visual spectacle are far from exhausted. How do filmmakers create new and fantastic spectacles that interest viewers the world over? With big money and very careful attention to contingent, cognitive universals, which, at the moment, many in film studies neglect, disparage, or deny. Notes 1. According to Edmund G. Bansak's Fearing the Dark: The Val Lewton Career (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 1995), Lewton apparently got feedback from his first startle effect in Cat People: "when Lewton attended a sneak preview audience for the film, he sat in the back and witnessed an entire audience jumping in unison at the appropriate time" (133). 2.

Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences weaves through nearly all his work, but the most expansive treatment is in Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intel- ligences, tenth anniversary ed. (New York: Basic Books, 1993). In "The Development of Object Concept," in The Construction of Reality in the Child, trans. Margaret Cook (New York: Basic Books, 1954), Jean Piaget describes the sixth, final stage of object permanence: "by virtue of the very fact that it enters the system of abstract or indirect images and relations, the object acquires in the subject's consciousness, a new and final degree of liberty . . . remaining identical to itself whatever may be its invisible displacements or the complexity of the screens which mask it" (84). 3. Bordwell's first extended discussion of contingent universals can be found in "A Case for Cognitivism," Iris 9 (Spring 1989): 11-40. His most elaborate presentation of the idea is in "Convention, Construction, and Cinematic Vision," in Post-Theory: Recon- structing Filmn Studies, ed. Noel Carroll and David Bordwell (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1996), 87-107. In Mystifying Movies (New York: Columbia Univer- sity Press, 1988), Carroll offers a crucial distinction between a "cultural invention and a cultural convention." Concerned with defending pictorial representation as a bio- logically grounded activity, Carroll uses the example of the plow to dispute absolute cultural relativity. He argues that the plow has exhibited modest variations across cul- tures throughout history but that its general parameters have consistently conformed to the purpose of "digging furrows," while "its effectiveness depended on its being accommodated to the structure of nature" (143). What one can say of the plow one can say of pictorial representation, which, in spite of important stylistic differences, re- mains committed to the purpose of showing worlds that, ultimately, accommodate to the structure of perception and the physical world. Even seeming violations of the 100 Cinema Journal 37, No. 4, Summer 1998</page><page sequence="20">structure of nature, such as Salvador Dalis Persistence of Memory ("Soft Watches," 1931), can be recognized as transpositions of one set of "grounded" rules for another, such as liquidity for rigidity. 4.

Much of contemporary psychology is built on evidence from neurol- ogy that precisely tracks the absence and lose of cognitive skills in particular individuals (color vision, facial recognition, various failures of language comprehension, lack of balance, and so on). Cognitive exceptions, of course, do not imply utter relativism. They make obvious the specieswide rule. 13. See Frederic C.
