The pleasure and excitement of reading Mike Weaver's book recalls for me that of reading?yes, reading!?Emily Mitchell Wallace's A Bibliography of William Carlos Williams.

Their books are enterprises successfully accomplished, clearly excellent. Though Mr. Weaver's book is not large, its effect is. His ability to search out the facts is matched by his ability to use them representatively. He is essentially an intellectual historian concerned with "the formation of Wil liams' thought," not only that referred to in the subtitle by "American background" but that of England and Europe as well. He organizes his materials chronologically, that is, biographically. New themes are intro duced at those stages in Williams' life when they were new or especially prominent, and their treatment is developmental. His work is significantly biographical, becoming emphatically so as the book reaches the 1930's, ending in fact with an excellent psychological sketch of Williams ("The Core of the Man") in his last years. At the same time he also considers those materials that elucidate Paterson. At the end of the first chapter on Wil liams' family background, early literary influence, and nineteenth-century poems on the Passaic River by Washington Irving and Thomas Ward, he observes: "The materials of Paterson were already to hand, the perch of the tradition of the regional poem established; it remained Williams' life-long task to evolve an indigenous method by which he could build a new bridge over the Passaic." (The appendices include a 35-page selection from Ward's Passaic, which relates the incidents of Sam Patch and Mrs. Cumming, and 18 pages of notes on Paterson.) Intellectual history, accordingly, is at the service of life and work, which, as Weaver shows, are themselves inseparable. When Weaver says Williams did not acknowledge that Paterson "belonged to a tradition of poems on the Passaic region," he declares his own intention: to make available to us the sources, acknowledged or not, in tradition and cultural-critical situation that nurtured Williams' work. His assumption? necessary to the intellectual historian?is that nothing comes from nothing. The "provincial" poet is not on that account outside the intellectual cur rents of the age; he may be, as Williams was, very much in them. We find, for example, that the erotic element so notable in and necessary to Williams' art was liberated by his engagement to Flossie?"the engagement itself," Weaver perceptively notes, "was his first act of daring and resolution"? and that this deliberate act had been prompted by reading Otto Weininger's Sex and Character, from which he had learned, among other things, that "man is genial [able to develop genius] and woman material [to be formed]." And Weininger, along with Max Stirner, was a basic text of Dora Marsden, editor of The New Freewoman (later renamed The Egoist), with whom Williams, at the time of his emergence as a poet, discussed such funda mental issues as feminism and egoism and male and female psychology. The richness of Weaver's account?a matter of a few close, well-written pages?is not easily conveyed. But having acknowledged this, perhaps it is only necessary for purposes of review to indicate the range and im portance of the intellectual episodes that comprise the book. When Weaver turns next to Contact, which had been Robert McAlmon's idea, the focus of his treatment is McAlmon's writing in Ace, a magazine of aviation, his reading in John Dewey, and his concern with functional education ("contact with experience, and with life"). His discussion of the impact of the new art on Williams' poetry is, in respect to the influence of Stieglitz, sketchy</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 557 (perhaps because I compare it with the book-length study by Rram Dijkstra). But in respect to Kandinsky, his discussion is the fullest I know. And it opens into a major contribution?Williams' reading of Whitehead's Science and the Modern World ("Finished reading it at sea, Sept. 26., 1927?A milestone surely in my career") and his correspondence with John Riordan, a young engineer with scientific and mathematical interests, over Steinmetz's Four Lectures on Relativity and Space and his own essay on Williams' poetry, "The Theory and Practice of Precision Poetry" (1926). Anticipated here are Williams' concern with "objectivist" poetry and the "variable foot"; and there is ample support here, and later, for Weaver's claim that "Williams' analogies for invention in poetry in the late twenties were drawn from physics rather than from linguistics." Weaver treats these central matters of objectivity and movement in poetry in subsequent chapters, one on Williams' relations to Zukofsky, Stieglitz, and Charles Sheeler, another on the musical contributions of Zukofsky and Antheil (prompted by Pound's book, Antheil and the Treatise on Harmony) and on the impact of classical jazz, in the 1940s, by way of Fred R. Miller. Miller was the editor of Blast (the American magazine), who introduced him to Runk Johnson and with whom he collaborated on Man Orchid, an unfinished novel. Also treated here is Williams' life-long interest in prosody and the American idiom: an early essay on "Speech Rhythm" (1913), his criticism of The American Language and correspondence with Mencken, and the employment in the later work of the "triadic foot." Much of what follows also involves the 1930's and 1940's, the period es pecially fertile for Pater son. A chapter on Williams' politics tells of the at tack on him by Mrs. Virginia Cummins of The Lyric that lost him an appointment, in 1952, as consultant in poetry in the Library of Congress (one wonders what he would have proposed or done in this position), of his attendance, in the 1930's, at the Third Writers' Congress and his con nection with the Writers' Project in New Jersey (it produced a state guide book), and his involvement in the American Social Credit Movement that Gorham Munson did so much to promote (a movement of consequence to Williams if only because James Laughlin's New Directions had its inception in New Democracy, the Social Credit review). Another chapter traces the development of Williams' "epic documentary style," a style owing much to photography and film and the efflorescence of documentary art in the 1930's (Alfred Kazin explores this more fully in On Native Grounds) as well as to the concern with original documents Williams had shown as early as In the American Grain. Such documents were readily available in Herbert A. Fisher's manuscript, "Legends of the Passaic," and Williams was en couraged to use them by Mrs. Kathleen Hoagland, a Rutherford writer who, in the 1940's, was writing a novel based on local historical ma terials (she also typed the first three books of Pater son). As for Williams' method of disposing them in the stream of his poem, he was most im mediately indebted to another local resident, David Lyle, a communica tions engineer, whose letters provide him instructive models (an example addressed to "Noah"?Williams?and signed "Faitoute"?Lyle?is in cluded). Lyle, Weaver says, "turned Williams' attention to the news, and the conception of a poem as the truth of contemporary events." Rut equally</page><page sequence="4">558 Pochmann important to Paterson and of deeper significance, as Weaver shows in the penultimate chapter, is all that Williams had learned of dada and sur realism and was learning now about the fantastic and monstrous, the magi cal, occult, and alchemical from View, the paintings of Pavel Tchelitchew, and the writing (including correspondence) of Robert Motherwell and Nicolas Calas. Much that had been of profound concern to Williams?the violence of emotion, the beauty of the monstrous, the mind's release, the dialectic relationship of the sexes, an open renewable world and the relation of the self to it?was now resumed because of the urgency of his poem and advanced by intellectual encounter. Relationship with Tchelitchew, whose masterwork Phenomena and anthropomorphic landscape Fata Mor gana (reproduced here) influenced Paterson, confirmed his wish to create "a mythology of contemporary life consisting of the strata of events both external in the objective world and internal in the subjective world." And relationship with Calas?he and Calas had proposed the magazine Midas opened to him the alchemical conception of the artist's work, which, in Jung's words, expressed his deepest intention: "the alchemistic opus is the labour of man the redeemer in the cause of the divine world-soul that sleeps in matter and awaits redemption." Weaver's analysis of some of the alchemical imagery of Williams' opus suggests to me that he himself should undertake a fuller study of this kind. Or if not that, then perhaps he should?since he has the skills and com mands the manuscript resources?undertake a biography of Williams (hopefully with a more detailed index than in the present book and as many or more illustrations). And should he do either or both of these necessary studies, he should also do, by the way, what his own work shows is very much needed?new editions of Williams' letters and essays.
