<plain_text><page sequence="1">THOMAS STONER "The New Gospel of Music": Arthur Farwell's Vision of Democratic Music in America In the article "The New Gospel of Music" published in 1914, the composer Arthur Farwell (1872-1952) proclaimed with characteristic democratic fervor "that the message of music at its greatest and highest is not for the few, but for all; not sometime, but now; that it is to be given to all, and can be received by all."' Grandiloquent, confident, and impatient, the statement epitomizes the central theme of a sizable collection of writings, most of which Farwell published in the years just before the United States entered the Great War. Riding the tide of optimism and progresssive ideals sweeping the country at the time, this outspoken advocate for American music attempted in these writings to awaken his countrymen to the possibilities of a new era he envi- sioned, in which a cultivated music would be produced for the common people. For Farwell, the foundation of his New Gospel of Music was the community music movement that had begun to flourish in the pre- war years. His own work in the field was extensive, beginning in 1910, when he became Supervisor of Music in the Parks of New York City. This activity continued over the next fifteen years as he composed music for a number of pageants and pageantlike works, organized and directed community choruses, experimented with musical forms in- volving audience participation, and initiated an outdoor "Theatre of the Stars" in the San Bernardino Mountains of California, where new types of music for the people were to be presented. Convinced of the importance of the community music movement, Farwell predicted that because of the creative energy it was generating, "new musical insti- Thomas Stoner is Associate Professor of Music at Connecticut College in New London, where he teaches courses in music history and theory.

The prediction was made in "Revolutionary Portents,"' an article in which Farwell's zeal for a new and vital musical life in America boiled over into subversive stridency: "The greatest musical question of America today is the impending revolution in our national musical life-a revolution which will shatter our limited national ideals and systems of the past and bring immensely broader purposes and methods for the future."2 Farwell's hopes for a democratic revolution in the nation's musical life mirrored a much larger cultural rebellion affecting all the arts in America. Brewing for several years before World War I, the rebellion was the first crack in a well-grounded structure of genteel values and standards inherited from the preceding century. Referring to it as the "Innocent Rebellion,"' the historian Henry E May noted that the dis- integration of nineteenth-century ideals generally associated with the postwar twenties was actually well under way before 1917.3 A signif- icant aspect of this revolt was directed against the notion that American art must be modeled on the best creation of Europe, charging that the "American arts were not an organic part of American life."4 In agreeing with this indictment, Farwell allied himself spiritually with a number of contemporaries who upheld a Whitmanesque-Emersonian ideal pos- tulating that the finest art is produced by those who have assimilated the culture in which they are living. Farwell's strong democratic feelings echoed those of several contem- poraries. The painter Robert Henri (1865-1929) advanced an "art that expresses the spirit of the people today" and an artist who sees his work as "a means of talking with men, of saying his say to himself and to others."' The architect Louis Henry Sullivan (1856-1924) be- lieved that the task of the architect is "to vitalize building mate- rials... to infuse into them the true life of the people, to impart to them the best that is in the people." The literary and social critic Van Wyck Brooks (1886-1963) said that Americans should "teach our pulses to beat with American ideas and ideals, absorb American life, until we are able to see that in all its vulgarities and distractions and boastings there lie the elements of a gigantic art." And Farwell would have been in total accord with the arts critic Paul Rosenfeld (1880-1936), who declared that the "fatal shortcoming" of American music was "its utter innocence of any vital relationship to the community."'6 Farwell's New Gospel prefigures, to an extent, a popular stand during the years of the Great Depression and World War II, when a movement for bringing art music to the larger public took place. Aaron Copland expressed a need in this period to write in a "simpler" style as a response to the growing division he saw between the composer and public. Very similar to the tone of Farwell's rhetoric is that of The New York Times</page><page sequence="3">Democratic Music in America 185 music critic Olin Downes, who wrote in 1935: "We should not be specialists writing music for musicians, but should be writing for the public. ... We in America must cast aside our inherited mental snobbery and smartness and talk of art for art's sake .. being honest with ourselves by casting out fear and being original and creative in our own right." The composer Elie Siegmeister likewise took up a theme of Farwell's in speaking of a "profound belief in the greatness and power of the people,' which he believed generated new forms of music.7 Although the populist movement of the 1930s and early 1940s pro- duced better known and more lasting results than Farwell's mission for a people's music, it seems no coincidence that such similar attitudes were spawned in periods that were characterized both by heightened social concern and a testing of the nation's democratic faith in the face of war. Farwell's serious interest in music developed relatively late, when he was a student of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Perhaps his delayed entry into formal musical training, coinciding with the growing self-reliance of young adulthood, helped eventually to foster his maverick attitudes toward the musical estab- lishment. Despite the unconventional views he was to adopt, his train- ing in composition followed customary lines. He studied with several teachers in Boston after his graduation in 1893, and then in 1897 left for Europe, where he spent the next two years working with Engelbert Humperdinck, Hans Pfitzner, and Alexandre Guilmant. Unlike most composers who had gone abroad, Farwell, upon returning home, was troubled at the prospect of writing music that was overly reliant on a European style. He felt a need to develop a musical language reflective of American life. The personal need soon evolved into an all-out crusade to further American music. His commitment was documented not only in his compositions using Native American and folk melodies, but also in his lectures and published articles, his founding of the Wa-Wan Press in 1901 -a time when it was unlikely for native composers to find an American publisher for their work, especially if the music exhibited nationalistic characteristics-and his establishment in 1907 of the Wa- Wan Society of America, an organization to support American com- position.8 It is clear that part of Farwell's mission from the beginning was to have the public play an essential role in developing the nation's music: "A complete and healthful musical life," he wrote in 1903, "lies in a sympathetic cooperation of composer, publisher, artist, audience and critic."' Two years previously, Farwell had discussed the relation of American music to the populace in a series of public talks, though apparently with little success: "I engaged a small hall in Boston, started in to give a course of lectures on the 'Relation of Art to the People/</page><page sequence="4">186 Stoner and got a few-a very few-of them out to hear me. I had a fine stock of ultra-idealistic ideas of which to unburden myself, and except for a young art student, I am certain that none of my auditors had any notion of what I was talking about."'o Farwell's ardor for this wider mission grew keener between 1903 and 1907, when he made four cross-country trips, ostensibly to present lecture-recitals on topics of American music, but also to assess the country's musical conditions. During his travels, Farwell's encounters with many gifted composers and other advocates of American music convinced him of the potential for a truly democratic musical life and the need for leaders with vision to direct such a movement." Farwell's ideas on democratic music had begun to appear during the first decade of the century in introductions to Wa-Wan publications, in musical magazines, and in general-interest periodicals such as North American Review, Review of Reviews, and Atlantic Monthly. Farwell's work with community music in the second decade brought greater focus to his philosophical principles and practical plans. A chance to give these views more extensive coverage had come in late 1908 when he joined the staff of the New York-based Musical America, then a weekly paper with national coverage. The readers of Musical America soon became familiar with Farwell's urgent sense of calling in the colorful autobiographical series, "Wanderjahre of a Revolutionist"; this appeared in twenty-five weekly installments (from January 23 through July 10, 1909) and included a summary of his work to that point on behalf of American music. The paper's editor, John C. Freund (1848- 1924), himself an outspoken supporter of American music, gave Farwell free rein to write reviews and editorials on any subject.12 But editorial writing clearly held the greater interest for Farwell. In a letter to the composer Arne Oldberg (1874-1962), written a little more than two years after coming to Musical America, Farwell rejoiced that he had given up reviewing concerts for the paper and would be able to devote more time to his primary interest, explaining the direction he envisioned American music should take: "I have retired from criticism, i.e., going to concerts for that purpose, though I am likely to write articles of a general critical nature. I retain my connection with the paper and contribute editorials, special articles, occasional reviews of music, etc.... I get less money for this-but about twenty five hours a week to myself that I did not have before-and shall much more than make it up on serious articles for magazines."'13 Although editorials with his byline do not appear in Musical America regularly until 1912, Farwell acknowledged that he had contributed opinion pieces to the paper's unsigned "Mephisto's Musings" column from "the spring or early summer" of 1909 continuously to "about January 1, 1913."'4 He noted in 1915 that the emphasis of his efforts</page><page sequence="5">Democratic Music in America 187 had begun to shift during his tenure at Musical America-from pro- moting the American composer and his music to examining the nation's wider musical life. "Several years ago I felt that I had served my term as a field-worker in this movement [for American music], and since then have largely confined myself.., .to an effort to define the prin- ciples upon which future advance must take place."'5 Musical America was Farwell's chief forum for elaborating his New Gospel, with the greatest concentration of articles (more than 100) appearing in the magazine between 1912 and 1915, though he continued to spread his ideas through other publications.'6 Most of the articles setting forth Farwell's credo appeared during the time of his involvement with community music. While his activities on behalf of community music are often singled out in biographical statements about Farwell, his call for the development of a democratic music in the United States is generally overlooked. Far more frequently cited are Farwell's labors in the first decade of the century to promote American composers and a national style of music. His New Gospel is a direct outgrowth of this earlier campaign, though the goals are more wide-sweeping, the tone more polemical, and the ideals more colored by the metaphysical. To assess fairly the idealistic vision of Farwell, which from our perspective seems often naive and belabored by an inflated prose, we should try to see it against the backdrop of robust optimism in the United States that preceded World War I. What follows is a three-part discussion of Farwell's vision: his belief that a revitalized musical life in America could be effected only as part of a larger cultural evolution resulting from a new spiritual conscious- ness; his philosophy of the role of music and the composer in a dem- ocratic society; and his practical ideas on new forms of music that reflect his philosophical principles. It is difficult today to identify with the euphoric atmosphere that prevailed in America in the years before World War I and surely fostered Farwell's exuberant ideals. The destiny of the United States, it was widely believed, was to lead the world to a better way of life. This high calling, carried over from the nineteenth century, was expressed in Whitman's view of America as the "custodian of the future of humanity." Such exalted opinions of America's potential were embraced by Farwell: "We are ... dealing with ... an evolutionary movement of mankind, in which we ourselves are the chief actors, and our own destiny the 'soul of the plot.' Unless we realize this matter thus broadly, we shall fail to see the universal magnitude of the evolutionary power and purpose in the matters of music and other arts closely at hand."'7 Typical of the highmindedness of Farwell and other progressive thinkers of the time is the view that America's moral mission is part</page><page sequence="6">188 Stoner of a natural evolution, one in which mankind is making "a conscious effort to reach a better world which could be glimpsed, or at least imagined, in the future."'18 This evolution, Farwell believed, was im- pelled by a spiritual impulse-"the One Universal Spirit, out of which is created, and is being created, all that is ... from the creation of worlds to the creation of songs."'" The great changes taking place in all aspects of thought and activity in America in his time- in science, education, literature, philosophy, and the arts-were seen by Farwell as part of an "emergence of Spirit" that had already begun to usher in a new era of richer benefits for the nation's people.20 Such a mystical view of evolution, not uncommon at this time, was given thrust by Henri Bergson's popular theory that a Life Force (elan vital) was the basis of all change. Bergson, who lectured at Columbia University in February, 1913, was the most authoritative spokesman for a new, vitalistic think- ing that had become, in the early teens, a rage among American in- tellectuals.21 Several references to Bergson in Farwell's articles indicate admiration for the French philosopher and more than passing famil- iarity with his ideas. Farwell's idealistic passion reached its highest pitch in his view that the goal of evolution as a spiritual phenomenon was ultimately to unify mankind.22 In this buoyant era, the evolution of a universal brotherhood did not seem too much to hope for. He saw the arts as playing a primary role in bringing this about, with the most important vehicle being music, "a spiritually centripetal force, drawing men together into a single emotion or idea."23 The idea of a music to unite mankind may seem quixotic today, but Farwell was not alone in his romantic designs. Van Wyck Brooks, who lived during these years, noted that the era before the War was "a conscious-or at least a half conscious-prep- aration" for creating such an art, and that the theme of one of the most admired novels of the time, Romain Rolland's Jean Christophe (1904-1912), was "an international art that was to bring men of all nations together."24 Farwell's references to Jean Christophe indicate that Rolland's ideals fueled his own lofty claims for music. That Farwell espoused a universal music alters somewhat the typical picture of him as a promoter of a national style; however, advancing the causes of both a universal music and a national style was not a contradiction to him. He believed that it was necessary first to develop a strong, national musical language from which a universal music could then develop. Although he made use of indigenous material in his compositions in an effort to create a national style, he did not, above all, wish to be seen as promoting American music for chauvinistic reasons. The dawn of a new cultural era in America seemed especially close at hand to Farwell as the dark days of World War I appeared to signal "the end of the age" of European civilization. He called on musicians</page><page sequence="7">Democratic Music in America 189 in America to help replace the passing order and "to ponder the era of faith and brotherhood which must follow fast upon the collapse of this era of confusion and violence."25 Even after the war ended and disillusionment replaced innocent optimism for many Americans, Far- well continued to believe that the country could play an important role in the evolution of a new culture. The newly published The Decline of the West (1918-1922) by Oswald Spengler only bolstered Farwell's belief that the optimum moment had arrived for America: If the country could awaken to the potential of its democratic aims, there was a great possibility for the dawn of a new cultural era in the New World.26 Unlike most progressives of the time, who believed that a better future was inevitable and part of a natural evolution, Farwell claimed that a new age was possible only if the American people took advantage of the opportune conditions and cooperated with the Spirit to bring it about.27 The rise of a cultural era, Farwell held, was tied fundamentally to "a new religious interpretation of the world"28 that in turn would kindle a national spirit out of which art is born.29 Farwell's own proclivities toward the metaphysical are everywhere evident in his articles, touch- ing all aspects of his views on music. He opined that a spiritual ferment taking place in America during these years might lead the way to a new religion blending mysticism, democratic thought, and psycholog- ical introspection. Its seeds, he suggested, could lie "in the peculiar quality of Emerson's philosophic transcendentalism, of Lincoln's hu- manity and democracy, [and] of Whitman's ontological passion of self- revelation."'3 References in his writings to Transcendental thought (such as Emerson's concept of the "over-soul") and to older Western and Eastern mystical writings (for example, those of St. John of the Cross and the cabala),31 reveal a personal credo informed and inspired by mysticism. But, for Farwell, as for many intellectuals of his time, this mysticism was fused with the latest scientific thought on the intuitive and unconscious mind, as indicated by his references to the ideas of contemporaries such as Bergson, William James, and Maurice Maeter- linck.32 The ideals of "democracy and humanity" symbolized by Lincoln were for Farwell inextricably linked to progressive thought. In its nine- teenth-century, quasi-religious sense, "progress" was a moral imper- ative in which the people made a conscious effort to help create a better world. In order to do this, Farwell held that one had first to learn what it meant to be human in its deepest psychological sense and to understand one's relationship with the universe and its laws. For guidance on ontological matters, Farwell looked less to Whitman- although he was an important inspiration-than to the "New Thought" writings on self-development by the Englishman Thomas Troward (1844-1916).33 Perhaps most compelling to Farwell-trained as a sci-</page><page sequence="8">190 Stoner entist as well as a musician-was Troward's system called "mental science," which posited a Universal Intelligence as a principle of crea- tivity, whose laws, when understood, could be used by individuals for the good of all the people. Troward's writings probably came to Far- well's attention in 1911,34 a propitious moment in the forming of his view. From this encounter, he claimed to approach composing through the use of the intuitive mind and saw this revelation as important to the composer in a new age. The essence of music for Farwell was its spiritual message, but it was a message that had to be directed to the masses rather than to the individual. Farwell had complete faith that the American people were ready for a music that aspired to higher aims than just enter- tainment: "The people are coming to have great musical needs in this country. They long since created a new and sufficient popular music out of their need... But they have deeper musical needs-not indi- vidual cultivated Americans, but the whole people-... which will be as surely, even if not quickly, satisfied.""3 His idealism brooked no argument that the people were incapable of grasping art music without prior training. Farwell believed, with Whitman, that a large group of people assembled at an event such as a national celebration were charged with a special electricity that re- moved their differences as individuals, allowing them to "encounter equality as an everyday experience."36 Applying this train of thought to a musical experience, Farwell referred to it as the "principle of 'mass appreciation' -that human capacity which enables the mass to get the full measure of spiritual nourishment from music which the individuals of that mass cannot appreciate intellectually... ."37 It was a phenom- enon in which "an intellectual process [was] 'short-circuited' by a spiritual process."38 He believed he had seen this phenomenon take place at the free orchestral programs for the public he had arranged as supervisor of municipal concerts in New York City during the sum- mers between 1910 and 1913.39 Although he described the concerts as "experiments ... looking toward the determination of the public taste in music and its capacity to development,"'40 more important to him was the mystical communication that transpired on these occasions: "It is no longer the separate minds which listen, it is the over-soul of the mass, and.. . in its capacity to assimilate the most real essence of all that vibrates upon it, no limits can be ascribed."'4 Farwell took the arguable position that the greatest music in the West-from the Greeks through Wagner-had always had a broad- based spiritual message.42 One might agree with his assessment that Bach, Beethoven, and Wagner dealt with "the supreme issues of life and the soul" through their art, but Farwell's implied belief that their</page><page sequence="9">Democratic Music in America 191 music spoke to a wider humanity seems a weak attempt to find historical support for his position.43 Farwell rejected outright any music that could be considered elitist, including music of his own day, which he found bankrupt of spiritual meaning. Such music seemed to him to represent either an attempt to conserve styles no longer viable or a self-indulgent following of experimental paths."44 Farwell's adamance in this regard led him to a severe indictment of composers such as Brahms, Strauss, and Debussy; he called them "Slaves of Art apart from Life" and excoriated their music as "purely artistic invention... a Godless, a soul-less world of art."45 But this outcry in its extremity was an over- drawn admonition that European music could no longer serve as a model for composers of a democratic nation rather than a total rejection of this music. Farwell knew that in his envisioned new era there had to be room for an elite music alongside an art of wider appeal. Thus, his rejection of the absolute symphony for being "too abstract to mean anything" to the masses46 is tempered: "Probably there must always be a standard of pure music, to show what the medium is capable of in the abstract."'4 His denouncement of "elitist" composers is probably best considered in face of the urgent need he saw for developing a democratic music; outside this context his writings show respect, if not admiration, for Brahms, Strauss, and Debussy. In addition to its spiritual function, music served for Farwell a closely related social role, which can be seen as part of a larger meliorism taking place in the United States in his time. It was an age in which growing awareness of the dehumanizing effects of industrialization led to legislation to protect the laborer and consumer. Recreational pro- grams were instituted to enhance life in the growing cities, while newly established settlement houses served the needs of a swelling immigrant population. "Social betterment," "human uplift," and "progressive spirit"-catch-words in writings of the socially concerned-indicate not only a belief that conditions in society could be improved but also a faith in the intelligence and good will of the people at large. That Farwell found himself more in tune with the aspirations of social activists than with those of the musical establishment is indicated by his involvement with the growing community music movement. As he pointed out, "the vision of the new musical condition is not primarily a product of the musical mind, . . ." but rather "the product of the social mind, the mind which is concerned with the general human welfare of the nation."48 Social improvement through art had been a crusade of the "Arts and Crafts" movement, which came to America from England in the latter part of the nineteenth century and remained strong until the outbreak of World War I. One of the primary goals of this movement was to bring the beauty of art into the everyday life of all people,"49 a</page><page sequence="10">192 Stoner view consonant with that of Farwell. Like many who believed in the social function of art, Farwell took considerable inspiration from the writings of William Morris, one of the foremost English leaders of the Arts and Crafts movement. Morris's artistic goal, distilled in his phrase "art made by the people and for the people, a joy to the maker and the user,""5 clearly resonates in Farwell's words affirming "that in its truest form musical art should be a simple and available pleasure for all, to beautify the daily household or social life."51 It is not surprising that Farwell contributed two articles on the growth of community music to The Craftsman, a magazine which helped to popularize the Arts and Crafts ideals and which frequently carried articles on issues of de- mocracy and the arts. At a time when he felt little support from the musical community, he could be encouraged that his message was being read by those sympathetic to his cause.52 On the surface it may appear that Farwell's mission to uplift the masses through music was a continuation of the melioristic aims of such custodians of the genteel tradition as John Sullivan Dwight and Waldo Selden Pratt-aims that flourished from the late nineteenth century through the turn of this century.53 But unlike these preservers of tradition, whose motives he saw as overpatronizing, Farwell valued the masses for what they could mean to a national artistic life. Fur- thermore, he did not view as sacred the operatic and concert estab- lishment that had become well-ensconced in America by his time. The musical establishment, he pointed out, served only a small fraction of society and was grounded in "aristocratic" thinking: "Let us face Amer- ican facts. What have we to start with? An enormous, mixed and musically unregenerate population on the one hand, and a high degree of specialized musical cultivation, the possession of a few, on the other."54 The presence of such a minority "musical culture,' Farwell thought, created a situation in which a vital artistic life could not be nurtured. The term "musical culture" represented for Farwell the prevalent view that European music should be the model for music composed in this country; the term referred also to all institutions that kept the European influence alive in the United States. "America is saddled, hag-ridden, with culture ... [her] problem is to get rid of musical culture and put musical evolution - creative musical evolution - in its place.'55 The European-influenced concert system's exclusion of the wider public he found especially disturbing. Not only did the price of a ticket gen- erally preclude the attendance of the less affluent, but the system also allowed no participation by the people. Musical activity should be organized from the start with the populace in mind, Farwell insisted: "New kinds of organizations are needed where the people come in on the 'ground floor' "56 His patience was tried by the hide-bound sym-</page><page sequence="11">Democratic Music in America 193 phony and orchestra societies with their limited faith in the mass's potential: "Let it [the concert and opera-going public] be annihilated at a stroke, and as far as the running of the machinery of our national life is concerned it never would be missed." Retreating from this out- rageous and unrealistic stance, Farwell urged that the "little public,' the concert audience, collaborate with the "great real public." The former, with its special knowledge and historical perspective, and the latter, with its inherent love of music and great store of creativity, could together bring about a profoundly new musical life.57 The role of the composer in a democratic society, Farwell believed, was also adversely affected by culture. It encouraged the composer to develop an individual style rather than to look first outside to the people and the environment for inspiration and allow a personal style to develop on its own. He thought that it was the composer's duty to keep in touch with the soul of the people in order to give them "some- thing which is more broadly and deeply their own than anything which they already have."58 The composer must "study intimately the nature of American life and character,"59 and must not be in any way isolated from the people. He tried to steer composers away from the lure of the concert hall, because this audience, he estimated, represented only a small percent of the country's population. Rather, the American composer should "begin... by ceasing to think of appealing to a con- ventional metropolitan concert audience with cramped and prejudiced minds, made up and trained to receive certain circumscribed things done in a certain circumscribed way, and by thinking of his fellow men in the mass, and what he could do for them in music that would raise from them a heaven-storming and earth-shaking shout of joy."60 He advised young composers to find a job in the work-a-day world- preferably not one related to music-which would cause them to rub shoulders with the masses; this would actually further their composing, he said, for they "will learn a human sympathy not to be acquired by dreaming in isolation."'6 Anything that removed the composer from the people would in the end only weaken the art. For Farwell, a composer must become "spiritual,"' not in any orthodox religious sense but through a deeper awareness of the nature of the intuitive mind and its connection to universal forces; with this aware- ness, the composer could achieve formerly unknown powers to work for the good of all. Taking his cue from Troward's writings on "mental science,' he believed that the intuitive mind provided humankind with extraordinary possibilities and that, contrary to what might be thought, the means to develop its potential was not an esoteric subject. These means belonged rather to a fund of knowledge surfacing in his time that was available to anyone interested and could be employed for very practical ends-the mind being "an instrument through which a</page><page sequence="12">194 Stoner man... [is] to do red-blooded work in a real world."62 Farwell looked upon the development of one's intuitive mind as a means of "self- improvement" in a new age and pointed to the large number of pub- lications on the topic as harbinger of a dawning era.63 Nowhere are Farwell's idealism and practicality joined more ob- viously than in his ideas on using the intuitive mind to compose music. The right spiritual orientation of a composer brings not only originality but the ability to communicate with fellow beings, he said, for "if the living spirit is in his expression, no newness of individual artistic char- acter will keep that spirit from finding its mark in the spirit of others"'64 Although Farwell's preferences in musical style did not incline toward the avant garde, he argued nonetheless that if composers were to find the right vehicles for their ideas, no one would object to their com- positions, even if they contained "such details as doubly altered dom- inant thirteenth chords"'65 Maintaining that this creative spiritual prin- ciple had always operated on a subconscious level, he thought that in the present age it could be consciously used to benefit mankind.66 Farwell's philosophizing about democratic music is offset by practical ideas on forms of music and types of performance that he believed would have to be part of a new age. The composer's direction in these matters had to be sought in the people: "the problem of the creative musician in America. . . [is] not to force some particular form of his art belonging perhaps to the past, on his people, but to seek out the true need of the people, and let his response to that determine the form of his art."67 His own thoughts on these matters derive from composing and producing new kinds of works for community perfor- mance, specifically in the areas of community chorus, massed singing, and musical drama. In all three Farwell saw himself charting new waters, and although confident of what he wished to achieve, he recognized that his work in these areas had only begun and required considerable refinement if it were to succeed. If at times his enthusiasm led him to take questionable positions, his intent was, above all, to inspire composers and community leaders to explore the untapped riches of civic music. Farwell's interest in the community chorus was kindled by Harry Barnhart (1874-1948), a choral director who had gained recognition for his charismatic song-leading at large civic gatherings. The two had met early in the century on one of Farwell's western tours. Crediting Barnhart as the "originator of the community chorus movement in its present form," Farwell especially admired his work with the Rochester (New York) Community Chorus and was instrumental in securing his leadership in forming the New York Community Chorus in 1916. Barn- hart, in turn, shared Farwell's ardor for a people's music, and together</page><page sequence="13">Democratic Music in America 195 they drew up, in 1913, "principles" of the community chorus move- ment. One of these, perhaps the most controversial, was that the ability to read music was not requisite to joining a chorus.68 Such a position was bound to draw a response of the sort levied by the well-known New York choral director Frank Damrosch (1859-1937), who had worked with amateur singers through his organization of the People's Singing Classes and the People's Choral Union. Damrosch claimed that the newly founded New York Community Chorus was an "ephemeral scheme,"' making "sensational promises" to its prospective members "which cannot and will not be fulfilled." Farwell countered with typical idealism, stating that the primary goal of the community chorus was not a musical one but rather for the "emotional, intellectual, spiritual unification" of a community, and that "the art of music" was only a vehicle for this higher purpose. And he expressed a conviction -similar to his belief that an audience could be mystically united by mass appreciation-that individual members of a community chorus were transformed by music "into a single great oversoul having a common vision and sense of the real human needs of the day"'69 Although Farwell maintained that "community singing is not casual crowd sing- ing,'7' and it is true that the New York Community Chorus did aspire to sing serious works (a performance of Messiah, for example, took place at Madison Square Garden, December 26, 1916), it appears that the artistic value of the venture had a lower priority for him than the social benefits. This was a sacrifice he apparently considered necessary in the initial stages of building a democratic music, but he was con- vinced that eventually, as the process would play its way out, an art of the highest order would follow. Meanwhile, he continued to search for other ways to involve the community in music. During the late summer of 1916 Farwell discovered another potential in the singing of massed audiences when he helped organize a Song and Light Festival to be held in New York's Central Park September 13 and 14. The program consisted primarily of selections performed separately by the newly organized New York Community Chorus71 and by a sixty-five-piece orchestra. But the portion that drew the greatest praise from the press and had the most significance for Farwell was the antiphonal singing by the chorus of 800 voices positioned at the north side of the park's lake and the audience of some 30,000 that crowded the south end each night. The poignancy of the massed sing- ing, combined with a striking outdoor setting lit by numerous colored- glass lanterns, made a particularly strong impact on Farwell: here "was a new art of design in colored light that turned the entire landscape into a veritable 'temple built without hands.' And over all was MYS- TERY"72 Perhaps most moving of all to him was the unusual sense of community engendered by the singing of the chorus and crowd, a</page><page sequence="14">196 Stoner feeling echoed by reporters who were present." Reflecting on the fes- tival some months after it took place, Farwell extolled the extraordinary possibilities of the community music movement in crystallizing com- munity spirit: The tides of a nation's history are bound up with that which it utters in its song, when that song is truly the voice of the nation, and the meaning of community music in America to-day is that America is seeking and beginning to find that voice. When a thousand people, people from the streets, the shops, anywhere, scarcely any of them professional singers, meet periodically and sing together, and at last go out into a park to sing to 50,000 other people, and to get that other 50,000 to sing with them, -and this happened in Central Park last summer-it is impossible to know what this movement will lead to in its next stage.74 Obviously affected by the Song and Light Festival, Farwell next began to experiment with the use of audience singing in more formal ways. In the early 1920s he wrote two works, primarily orchestral, which are interspersed with song verses for amateur singers. Symphonic Hymn on "March! March!" uses a song he composed for the New York Community Chorus's performance at the Song and Light Festival; the work does not require a trained chorus, but "merely a sizable group of persons fairly familiar with the song." In his Symphonic Song on "Old Black Joe," which Farwell claimed was inspired by the singing of the crowds at the festival, the entire audience joins the orchestra in verses from the Foster song. Each of these works he described as a "symphonic song,"' a distinctly orchestral piece, but one that offered the people an op- portunity to participate in "works of larger emotional and formal con- tent" without going beyond their capabilities.75 In the symphonic song and similar compositions Farwell described (such as the "symphonic song suite" and the "dramatic ceremony") he sought a work that would communicate with the masses through the use of a text. He questioned whether traditional genres such as the absolute symphony had not already served their function, and whether they, indeed, had the vitality to endure in the new era that he foresaw: "Is not the symphony, as absolute music, played out as the supreme musical model?"''76 Given the great importance Farwell attached to a text, it is understandable that some sort of musical drama, because of "its wide appeal and comprehensibility, and its adaptability for the participation of the people,"77 was a genre he wished to explore. Farwell's opportunity to develop such a blending of music, drama, and democratic ideals came in the form of the community pageant, which had begun to flourish across the nation in the second decade of the century. The pageant involved generally a large cast of com-</page><page sequence="15">Democratic Music in America 197 munity members in an outdoor setting depicting some aspect of local history, often in a series of alternating historical and allegorical scenes, the latter generally making greater use of music. Farwell became an impassioned backer of the pageant and it was perhaps his witnessing of a pageant given at Thetford, Vermont, in the summer of 1912, that suggested to him its power as a democratic art work: "None of the things shown or done on this outdoor stage were extraordinary or wonder-provoking in themselves .., .or anything beyond what any American town or country community could do proportionately to its own size. And yet these things brought together and put into a certain order were capable of gripping the attention of several thousand persons for two hours and a half, and of producing in the multitude one of the most powerfully exalting and humanly moving emotions which life can afford."78 After being commissioned to write the music for the Pageant of Mer- iden (New Hampshire)79 and the Pageant of Darien (Connecticut),80 both produced in the summer of 1913, Farwell was even more convinced of the pageant's great possibilities. Always ready to visualize events in their grand perspective, he saw it becoming perhaps as important to America as the drama was to the ancient Greeks.81 He was not alone in his enthusiasm. Randolph Bourne (1886-1918), an astute young critic for the pronational culture magazine Seven Arts, was convinced that the burgeoning pageant movement indicated the advent of "a new social art in the American world, something genuinely and excitingly new."'82 The dramatist Percy MacKaye (1875-1956) spoke of pageantry as "poetry for the masses,"' which "satisfies an elemental instinct for art" and which, if refined, could "develop into a mighty agency of civilization." The "dramatic pageant" or "masque," MacKaye said, "should be capable ... of combining the popular appeal of an Isadora Duncan-Damrosch concert, a Sorolla exhibition, and a Maude Adams- Barrie play,"' and its themes should not be limited to the historical: All vital modern forces and institutions of our nation-the press, the law, the railroads, the public-school system, athletics, the uni- versities, the trades unions in all their variety, the vast industries of steel and copper and wheat and fisheries and agriculture, and hundreds more-might appropriately find symbolic expression in majestic masques, educative and entertaining to all the people. By such means, artistic gifts, which are now individualized and dispersed, would be organized to express the labors and aspirations of communities, reviving-for the nobler humanism of our own time-the traditions of Leonardo, Ben Jonson, and Inigo Jones. By so doing, the development of the art of public masques, ded-</page><page sequence="16">Figure 1. Cast of the Pageant of Darien in a photo from Musical America, September 6, 1913.</page><page sequence="17">Democratic Music in America 199 icated to civic education, would do more than any other agency to provide popular symbolic form and tradition for the stuff of a noble national drama.83 Other proponents also emphasized the value of the pageant in satisfying an elemental need for community self-expression, teaching a com- munity about its past and developing civic pride, and drawing com- munity members together.8 In addition, Farwell said, the pageant gave the community an access to music, dance, and drama "denied them in the.., .financially forbidding art-world."85 Farwell acknowledged that the musical world of his day would prob- ably not recognize the pageant as a legitimate art form, because pro- ductions were often amateurish and crudely put together. But if the form were taken over by a true dramatic poet who could enrich the whole with appropriate music, the pageant could be every bit "as concrete in its way as the art-forms of drama, symphony, or opera in theirs... ."86 He mentioned his own efforts to create greater unity in the pageant by composing symphonic music that integrated the his- torical and allegorical scenes.87 In addition, his pageants included orig- inal hymns or "communal songs" for audience participation; he be- lieved these had "greater lyrical freedom and greater harmonic richness than either religious or patriotic hymns."88 Farwell argued that it was far more likely that a truly lasting work would be created by a composer who wrote a pageant for "thousands of human souls waiting eagerly for what he has to give forth" than by one who "thinking himself true to the 'ideal'.. . will not forsake the symphonic form... ." Furthermore, he noted, the composer of the pageant would get paid for it!89 By 1914 Farwell realized that, despite its promise, the pageant as it stood would not fulfill his expectations for a new democratic musical drama. One of the pageant's primary shortcomings, he believed, was that it lacked a theme more universal in scope than could be provided by local history; while such a work must have relevance to the com- munity, it must also voice the aspirations of all mankind. The genre Farwell conceived to supersede the pageant he called the "community music drama": it represented for him the epitome of his New Gospel of Music. Farwell had in mind "a spiritual drama.., of the higher vision and possibilities of man,"' a sort of religious ceremony for the community- a ceremony harking back to the most ancient Greek drama. Recent models also fed his imagination. Like Wagner's music drama, Farwell's democratic art work was to be based on myth, an "American myth," that though not wholly discovered, was somewhere enfolded in the spirit of the people.90 More tangible was his goal of using the music drama for strengthening community spirit. The model for this was an</page><page sequence="18">200 Stoner American one, a festive outdoor play with music that took place in a redwood forest of California, the so-called "Grove Play" or "Midsum- mer High Jinks" presented annually by the all-male Bohemian Club of San Francisco. Images of Wagnerian music drama were plainly before Farwell upon witnessing a Grove production in 1904. He was thunderstruck by this "American Bayreuth,' and it remained in his mind as a vivid model for democratic music: "Since Wagner's realization of Bayreuth there has been no such striking and extraordinary musical-dramatic devel- opment as the great Forest Festival. Its influence upon American art has only begun."" Farwell's regard for the Bohemian Club productions cannot be overestimated. Numerous references to them in his articles praise the plays as a paragon of American ingenuity in the arts.92 Even much later, after Farwell had given up his work in community music, he claimed that the Bohemian Club offerings were "the strongest in- fluence in the shaping of my artistic life and success."93 Farwell claimed that he first experienced mass appreciation while attending the 1904 Grove Play. He noted that the Bohemian productions provided nearly ideal conditions for this to occur, citing several which he believed should be emulated by the community music drama. First, there was a unifying idea that brought the members of the Bohemian Club together, a ceremonial "slaying of care" that was central to each year's production. Farwell contended that a festive occasion centering on a "single great idea" was essential in creating a communal art work, and he suggested that a unifying theme such as "the spirit of a great religious composer" or "the historical self-expression of a city" would be appropriate in this respect. In addition, all participants of the Grove Play were members of the Bohemian Club. The sense of communal expression achieved through such self-sufficiency, Farwell believed, was essential to a community drama. That the Grove Play was a periodic event, presented only once a year during the August full moon, was another feature to be adopted. Frequent performances would make community music drama as routine as commercial concerts and opera productions and would detract from the ceremonial quality Farwell wished to achieve. Finally, just as the Bohemian Club productions took place at an awe-inspiring redwood grove in northern California, so should the community music drama's "place of observance" be one of great natural beauty, where eternal things might be more closely contemplated.94 In Farwell's conception, although community members were to per- form in the music dramas, only experienced composers and authors were to create the work; all artistic decisions would be left in their hands.9" Furthermore, he left little doubt that he viewed the community music drama first of all as a musical work and secondly as a drama.</page><page sequence="19">Democratic Music in America 201 The "need is to let the dramatic conception arise from within the region of musical consciousness. Without this, there must eternally be the curtailment of ... [music's] highest possibility."96 Further, the work must speak to the whole person--body, mind, and soul. Through dance and other forms of bodily movement, through idea, and through emotion it was to communicate wholly and equally to the spectator and par- ticipant.7 Taken to its ultimate, he thought, the music drama could be a means of drawing a community toward the highest goals of self- improvement, goals that if attained would have truly signaled the dawn of a new age in which music would take its rightful place in the life of the people."8 Although Farwell's dream of a community music drama never ma- terialized, aspects of it were realized in his experiments with various pageantlike works, perhaps most successfully in his Caliban by the Yellow Sands (1915), a masque (with book by Percy MacKaye) performed in late May of 1916 as part of New York City's Shakespearean Tercen- tenary festivities. The performance of Caliban involved some 2,000 participants and was, according to one writer, New York's "first ac- quaintance with the community masque or pageant, a new artistic institution still in its swaddling clothes but, in the estimation of its sponsors, of tremendous possibilities for the democratizing of art, and the elevation of popular ideals."99 It seems probable that the Theater of the Stars that Farwell established some years later, in 1925, was to be a setting for community music dramas, though that undertaking was apparently too short-lived to have brought this about. By the end of 1915 most of Farwell's "principles" for a democratic musical life had seen their way into print, and his flow of articles began to slow considerably. For the next ten years, much of his effort went to composing and directing projects related to community music. In the aftermath of World War I the country's democratic spirit was greatly diminished, and many of the hopeful rebels of the prewar years had become disillusioned, believing, in Gertrude Stein's words, that "the future is not important anymore." Farwell's drive to continue his mission seemed as energetic as ever, being marked by a move, in 1918, to California. Here, in a locale which he thought was more conducive to the growth of community music than the tradition-bound East,0oo he wrote and produced five pageantlike works,'0' organized a community chorus, and launched his Theater of the Stars. By 1927, when Farwell moved to Michigan to take a teaching post at the State College in East Lansing, his role in community music had become less active. He continued to believe that the development of community music was the only path toward creating a new national musical life. But his crusade had been a lonely one. For all the progress</page><page sequence="20">202 Stoner Figure 2. Scene from a production at Farwell's outdoor Theater of the Stars, located near Big Bear Lake in California's San Bernardino Mountains, which appeared in Musical America, March 26, 1927, page 3.

It is chaotic, amorphous, lacking in definite purpose, but a movement which is capable of immense and un- foreseen developments if grappled with by the creative artists capable of molding and giving direction to its forces. In its greater moments it has evinced something of the spiritual temper of Amer- ica, but it cannot be said that it has yet identified itself with the deeper spiritual currents of American life.102 Excerpted from one of the last articles expressing Farwell's hopes for the future, the passage suggests a certain disappointment that his expectations have not been fulfilled. From our present vantage point Farwell's vision may appear too Utopian, too much grounded in the high-minded, progressive thought of the years before World War I, or too antagonistic to the musical establishment to have ever created a viable art. In light of his goals for democratic music, Farwell's was</page><page sequence="21">Democratic Music in America 203 indeed a small-and, in the long run, ineffectual- voice in a nation whose musical life was just coming into its own. If in retrospect it seems that Farwell's efforts were misplaced and exacted at the expense of his own career as a composer of more traditional music (which he pursued more actively after 1925), the writings show his philosophical devotion to a cause which, as he was well aware, set him apart from the musical mainstream. For those, however, who would believe that the vitality of America's musical life depends on the creation of music which involves emotionally a fair portion of the nation's public, the basic issue that elicited Farwell's vision is still very much alive today.

May, End of American Innocence, 225, refers to a wave of scientific mysticism that was part of the pre-World War I cultural rebellion: "Life [from an early twentieth-century viewpoint].., .was more mysterious than the nineteenth century had thought;.., .to a few quotable scientists and many laymen, it meant that the science of life would never be reduced to physics and chemistry, because life was unique and by definition mys- terious. There was born the 'Life Force; a power which was up-to-date and defensible in the latest scientific language, but yet indefinable and sacred." Another American cultural historian, T. J. Jackson Lears, refers to a flourish of mysticism and variously related "mind curist" offshoots that stressed "instinctual liberation" taking place at this time, particularly in the urban Northeast. But he sees this rather as part of a reaction to "overcivilized" modern existence and a search for a more "authentic" experience. See T. J. J. Lears, No Place of Grace: Antimodernism and the Transformation of American Culture: 1889-1920 (New York: Pantheon, 1981), xiii-xv, 32, 38, 232. 33. New Thought, a movement originating in New England in the second half of the nineteenth century, rejects the anthropomorphic view of a supreme being, holding that God is Wisdom and that human beings are themselves of God to the degree that they manifest wisdom. Troward lectured on New Thought, and his books on the subject were widely read in the United States by adherents of the movement. See J. Gordon Melton, The Encyclopedia of American Religions, 2 vols. (Wilmington, NC: McGrath, 1978), 2: 51-81.

Although the "principles" he and Barnhart "worked out" are not clearly specified, the idea that chorus members do not need the ability to read music was obviously fundamental to their outlook. Barnhart's homespun philosophy on the leading of massed singing and the community chorus is discussed in May Stanley, "Making Humanity Happier Through Song,"' MA 24 (July 29, 1916): 3-4. 69.

Two choruses Farwell wrote for the group were performed at the festival for the first time: "March! March!" and "Joy! Brothers, Joy!" 72. Farwell, "When Thou Makest a Feast," MA 24 (Oct. 14, 1916): 89. Farwell described the unusual lighting created by Claude Bragdon (1866-1946) in an article on a similar Song and Light Festival held in Rochester, New York, a month earlier than the one in New York City. The same lanterns were used for the Central Park performances. Bragdon was an architect, artist, stage designer, and author of several books, including Projective Ornament (1913), Four-Dimensional Vistas (1916), and Architecture and Democracy (1926). A man of metaphysical ideas that were undoubtedly of interest to Farwell, Bragdon designed lanterns that Farwell described as "deriving... from higher, and especially fourth dimensional mathematics."

March!" was first performed on March 18, 1923, with the Los Angeles Phil- harmonic, the composer conducting; Symphonic Song on "Old Black Joe" was premiered in a concert at the Hollywood Bowl, August 22, 1924. In an undated letter to Nicolas Slonimsky at the Library of Congress (Slonimsky Collection: Farwell), Farwell notes that the symphonic song is "suggested by the Chorale Prelude of the Reformation, where the organist developed a hymn known to the congregation, and at the conclusion brought the congregation in," though he says his form is much freer. 76.

In addition to his own efforts to improve the pageant, Farwell was involved with the American Pageant Association, an organization which sought to raise the artistic standards of the pageant through disseminating information to communities planning pageants. See Farwell's account of the Association's founding meeting in Boston, January, 1913, in "Pageantry and the Composer," MA 17 (Feb. 15, 1913): 18. The organization's first president, William Chauncy Langdon (1871-1947), who was one of the foremost pageant directors of the time, collaborated with Farwell in creating the Pageant of Meriden and the Pageant of Darien. Langdon published a booklet on pageantry, The Celebration of the Fourth of July by Means of Pageantry (New York: Division of Recreation of the Russell Sage Foundation, 1912), to which Farwell contributed an article on the use of music in pageants. 87.

Taken from a talk on "Pageant Music" Farwell gave at the second annual con- ference of the American Pageant Association in New York, February 22, 1914, as reported in the unsigned article "Musical Side of Pageant Discussed," MA 19 (Mar. 7, 1914): 23. 89.

In addition to frequent passing references, Farwell wrote two articles on the productions, one cited in the preceding note and "The Bohemian Club High Jinks of 1909;' MA 10 (Oct. 16, 1909): 3-8. 93. From a letter to the Bohemian Club, June 1937, quoted in Kirk, 41. 94. Farwell first discussed the Bohemian productions' "ideal conditions" for achieving mass appreciation in "The New Gospel of Music" and "The New Gospel of Music- II,' singling out the conditions as important objectives in developing musical festivals. He links them specifically to the community music drama in two later articles, "Recent Object Lessons for an American Music Drama,"' MA 22 (July 10, 1915): 10, and "Final Considerations as to a National Music Drama,"' MA 22 (July 17, 1915): 10. 95.
