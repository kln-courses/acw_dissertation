Of course, such work competes these days for honesty of observation with the wild-life film?which usually leaves us in no doubt as to the unlovely angles and gross survival drives of some of our favourite mythic beasts at close range. Yet, while being obliged to ditch the soft-focus, poets can't evade their own genetic specialisation.

Members of that species know that if the reader fails to mutter 'Oh yes' and hop inside, they will become extinct. Mark Roper is well aware of the paradox, as many of the poems in this fine second collection dem onstrate. Confronted by horror in Appetite, the naturalist in him winces, but, happily, doesn't ex pire: he passes a harder test, though, when it comes to taking close-ups of the heron, a creature with more soft-focus potential than a goldfish chewed alive by four beetles. Two extremes of anthropomorphic possibility are balanced?heron as genius loci, heron as gangling 'fool'?and fi nally made to add up: "It drew blood when the wild-life ranger/ trapped it, folding its gorgeous plumage/ in a blanket. He rebroke the wing, set it./ It could have flown but wouldn't. Starved./ To the ground we returned the standstill/ of wing, the stained glass eye, the closed/ vowel of stomach, the silence of cry./ All the dried ingredients of grace." What is plain and slightly cliched in the diction of the earlier of these lines seems to be redeemed, after the vivid lift of the inversion, by that last, Heaney-esque image, where concrete and abstract force fully cohere. Nature-poems are frequently parables about ourselves, and may pierce towards metaphysics (the word 'grace' in Herons hints at such a process). In the title-poem, Roper tries to keep dazzlement at bay: "Medusas, my eyes: what they say they see, my tongue has no choice/ but to confirm. No slip ping of the tongue./ No such thing as no idea." Language may be the net over our imaginations but its conjury delays the onset of termi nal scepticism: "In a world of light we are creatures of distinction/ lost and found/ as we speak. Lost and found at this given moment/ in the wonder of saying/ an or ange husk of moon low on the horizon/ over Gortrush Wood"? the end of the poem deftly reca pitulating its opening images. It may be no more (and no less) than what Albert Schweitzer called "reverence for life" but a palpable current of religious feeling runs through the book, linking its most Zen-like moments ("I am/ water in a glass of silence./ Do not call, I am uncontained") to its most earthy. There is a demotic strain in Roper that expresses itself in the ballad form and may owe something to Larkin, the angry, mock-genteel Larkin of This be the Verse. You, an address to an un born child, lacks some formal polish but it's a riveting poem that punches holes in the unsayable: "Don't hold your absence against us/ you have your place in the parade/ you'll be there forever between us/ a difference we never made." Betrayed innocence is a central theme, and Roper approaches it in several ways. There are the sur real parables like Angel (a won derfully earthbound, flea-bitten angel who must be related to the tragi-comic heron) and straight forward reportage such as The Adventure Centre, both expertly handled. Then, unexpectedly, a voice borrowed from Paul Celan in his most terrible, god-challeng ing mode, strikes through: "How we survive, Lord. Twenty two homes,/ sixteen schools before we were ten./ Those blind uncles touching us up./ Our wounds wide open, our words not heard/ until we wept but were not al lowed to." (Prayer). Such poems are located no where or everywhere: in the uni versal awfulness of the human condition. Their lack of specific historical or geographical focus hardly matters. But Roper seems at his most English in poems like these, at his most Irish when ex pressing an undeceived human relationship with landscape. Unu sually, Roper has learnt from both Larkin and Heaney, and if there is hybridization, it has produced a distinctively original growth. Some of the poems here, the shorter lyrics especially, are achievements by any criteria: Honey, What the Deer Said, Marsh Marigolds, Hal cyon, November. Roper's dual na tionality will provide critics on both sides of the water with ample excuse to ignore him. But he is a member of a most interesting spe cies, and those who care about poetry's survival should keep the cameras trained on his progress. Carol Rumens</page></plain_text>
