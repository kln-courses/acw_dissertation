<plain_text><page sequence="1">acquisitions Grossman Bequest: The Pennsylvania Acad- emy, recipient of an important group of paint- ings through the bequest of David J. Grossman, is now probably the most extensive collector of works by Horace Pippin in the country. The Grossman bequest includes seven works by Pip- pin, ranging from Maple Sugaring, 1925, through a rare open-air painting of West Ches- ter Court House, 1940, to two rarely exhibited flower paintings. Included in the Grossman be- quest were also three works by Philadelphia artist Franklin Watkins who, as a former stu- dent of the Academy and local portraitist, was already represented in the Academy by several works. One of the Watkins oils, Classical Head with Cat, was painted for Grossman himself. The Academy previously owned only one work by Pippin, John Brown Going to His Hanging. Fluxus Made Permanent: The Dartmouth College Museum and Galleries announced this winter the founding of the George Maciunas Memorial Collection, which will consist of works and documentation donated (and loaned) in honor of the founding father of that inter- national art movement of the '60s. It is no coincidence, of course, that Jan van der Marck, director of the Dartmouth museum facilities, was also an early observer and champion of the movement and many of its artists. Since Fluxus artists deliberately overstepped traditional boundaries of creative and performing arts, the collection consists of a wide range of materials: verbal music scores, electronic monitors and sound producers, posters, poetry, photographs, and printed matter. Announcement of the col- lection's formation was correlated with a Fluxus exhibition and concert at the Hanover campus. Future traveling exhibitions of items in the collection are planned. Kent State's Loss: Sculptor George Segal's large plaster work of Abraham and Isaac, com- missioned for Kent State University to com- memorate the 1970 shootings and death of stu- dent demonstrators who were protesting mas- sive U.S. bombings of Cambodia, will not be cast for that unfortunate Ohio campus. Al- though the subject of perhaps the best-known Biblical sacrifice had been approved in consul- tation with Kent State representatives, as well as the choice of Segal as artist, the finished plaster was rejected by obviously nervous uni- versity officials. Fortunately, one man's loss is another's gain, and, in this case, the Princeton University Art Museum was delighted to accept the work for its permanent collection. The plas- ter is scheduled to be cast in bronze this year, and Princeton will have acquired not only an important monument, but also an important and, for the present, curiously extended exam- ple of Segal sculpture. The work was commis- sioned, and given, by the Mildred Andrews Foundation of Cleveland, and has recently been exhibited at the Walker Art Center and the Janis Gallery. Prints for Middlebury: Middlebury College's art collection, which hadn't reported its acqui- sitions for over a year, has been growing. A special gift was a group of about 1,300 prints donated by John Hull Brown in memory of his wife, Alice Cooke Brown. Included in the group are sheets by Hogarth, John Martin, Fantin- Latour, Forain, Marcantonio, van Ostade, Munch, Fuseli, von Aachen, and Thomas Cole, among many others. Also acquired from Mr. Brown was a charcoal drawing by John Singer Sargent of a female nude. The prints are a valued addition to Middlebury's study and ex- hibition collections. The Opposite: The other side of the coin from acquisitions-but closely related-is de-acqui- sition, or "deaccession" in more familiar par- lance. The word is usually bandied about in the press when some tinge of scandal or, at least, controversy surrounds the objects. But the practice is an old tool of collectors, and it is not always bad. It can be judiciously used to up- grade, refine, or define a museum's collections. When done wholesale and as a result of chang- ing, superficial fashion, however, it has rarely been of financial or long-term benefit to the disposing institution. Recently, several de-ac- quisition sales have occurred, coming from col- lege or school as well as public museum collec- tions. More and more frequently, these have taken place at auctions, not only because of the currently booming auction market, but also be- cause a public and open sale can defuse such questions of conflicting interests and secret "deals" for profit as those so vigorously raised by New York State Attorney General Lefkowitz in connection with sales from the Museum of the American Indian, the Brooklyn Museum, and, of course, the Metropolitan itself. The two sales we have chosen to discuss here are very different. Earlier this season, at a December sale in the Sotheby Parke-Bernet salesroom, a large col- lection of ancient, Egyptian, and Islamic glass was sold by Wheaton College. The 360-piece collection (sold in 155 lots) had been left to Wellesley by a non-alumna, Mrs. Edward P. Newell, in 1966, with no stipulations or restric- tions, together with a group of 500 coins. After ten years of possession, Wheaton recognized that the glass was not being used; it was too fragile to handle, the gallery had no facilities for its display, and it was not useful in the teaching program, as the coins were. Reluc- tantly, it was decided that the gallery could use the proceeds of a sale more effectively than it could use the objects themselves. Hoping to gain about $70,000, the Wheaton administration was delighted that the glass brought almost $175,000. This will now be set up as an endow- ment, income from which will be used mainly for acquisitions related to curriculum needs and, partly, for maintenance and installation expenses. We were amused to note that the glass was included in, and overshadowed by, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts' sale of Egyp- tian objects, scheduled for the advent of Tut- ankhamun to the Metropolitan-source of pub- lic interest in deaccessions! Furthermore, one of the records broken had been established by the Cranbrook Academy Museum sale in 1972-a 201 SPRING 1979</page><page sequence="2">sale which we still consider to have been re- grettable. In very early May Sotheby Parke-Bernet, New York, will be offering 100 European paint- ings from the Corcoran Museum collections under its ivory hammer. Although the group being offered is a very mixed lot, representing much of the splendidly bizarre taste of the 19th century, there are enough first-rate works and genuinely interesting study pieces to make the sale potentially attractive to other school and college museums, as well as the full gamut of international buyers. Because so few of these works have been seen hanging in the Corcoran for a very long time, and because the market for 19th-century European paintings of this sort-at first strictly camp, but now taken more seriously-has been on the rise, it seems useful to look into the causes and contents of the sale. Among the 100 works that the Corcoran is deaccessioning, about one-third are the gifts of William Corcoran himself, stars of the original installation that so elegantly stated the case for a post-Civil War American collection. We now know that Corcoran himself favored the devel- oping American School of painting, but that he purchased so much European art because he thought that he would be founding a National Gallery-an intention stymied for political rea- sons (his overt sympathy to the South during the Civil War). The Corcoran also received two other important collections with a good deal of high quality, especially Barbizon, 19th-century European painting. These, the Clark and Walker collections, cannot be legally disposed of by the Corcoran, thus leaving the income- generating burden to those unwanted works from the gallery's original donor. Among the most interesting paintings being offered are a pair of Ferdinand de Broekeleers, one of the two Cazins, Moonlight in Holland, which is a genuinely terrific painting, and a giant Cabanal, Death of Moses, 1874, needing restoration but as important a Cabanal as there is in the U.S. Another work of the same year, Gaston Saint-Pierre's luscious Odalisque, would be a fascinating acquisition to study be- side an Ingres and a Renoir of similar subject, painted as it was in the year of the first Impres- sionist exhibition but in the prevalent academic tradition that had developed from the earlier master. There are two first-class Detailles (but not quite so good as those in the Walters Gal- lery, only 40 miles from the Corcoran), a superb large Diaz, three good Dupres, a reasonably good Couture, and an unusual but splendid Hildebrandt landscape, Moonrise in Madeira. If the taste for pastiche 17th-century French pictures has developed along lines that have already become apparent for other European schools, the Michel Bouquet Halt of the Hunters at Fontainebleau should interest pro- spective buyers, as should the small and typical Bonheur Bull (for different reasons), or the Jules Breton Brittany Widow, which is almost as inspired a work of 19th-century sentiment as Chicago's Song of the Lark. Several excellent portraits, including a Regnault, can also be in- cluded in the attractive category. On the more negative side are a definitely problematical Bonnington, the not unusually questionable Corots, a Henner so awkward that it has to be either unfinished or an aberration, and a ques- tionable Monticelli. The prices for similar 19th-century pictures have been rising rapidly during these last years of historical revisionism, but they may not be out of sight, quite yet. Whether such a happy fate (for the Corcoran) will befall works by Oscar Begas or Aime Nicholas Morat, only the sale will show. We would expect the main com- petition for American purchasers to come from the virtual host of European dealers and mu- seums who are currently coming to New York to spend their softening dollars. Although many of these works would be excellent additions to strong U.S. study collections, there is almost certain to be some repatriation as a result of the sale. The results for the Corcoran should also be interesting to see. That beset institution hopes to raise half a million dollars from the sale, which it will dedicate to the acquisition of "his- torically important" American art, a policy de- signed by the trustees under acting director and fellow trustee Gilbert Kinney (perhaps the first ex-diplomat turned museum administrator) to ease the frustrations of lively curators with almost no money for acquisitions. Still, we can- not help realizing that even if the goal of $500,000 is reached, that entire sum would only buy two-thirds of the Bierstadt that the Brook- lyn Museum purchased two years ago. (Luckily, the Corcoran shouldn't have to buy a Bier- stadt!) Changing collections with the changes in taste can be an expensive policy, and we are more sanguine about the possibility of college and university museums being able to buy these paintings before their price level rises yet fur- ther than we are about the financial wisdom of selling them. With strong collections of "histor- ically important" American works at the neigh- boring N.C.F.A. and National Gallery, and with both those museums plus the Hirshhorn in- creasingly active in the contemporary field, one wonders where the Corcoran will go? * indicates illustration africa, america, oceania TAIRONA, Pre-Columbian, pendant in the form of an anthropomorphic deity, gold, ca. 500- 1500 A.D.

Coming as it does on the heels of several extremely popular block- busters in the same time frame of late-19th- century painting and after a decade of historical reevaluation of the period, it is all the more impressive because of the new interpretations and documentation added. When compared to beautiful, eye-catching undertakings such as the Met's Monet at Giverny, or even the pro- foundly moving concentration of late Cezanne, the Monticelli takes on added luster because it breaks new ground. Instead of reasserting old values with a slight shift in emphasis (as both the Cezanne and Monet shows did), Sheon's presentation of Monticelli approaches the sec- ond half of the 19th century from an altogether different point of view. Furthermore, he does so with such detail and care that our conception of at least 60 years of French painting may be permanently modified. The exhibition, which traveled from the Carnegie to Toronto, is cur- rently at the Corcoran and this summer may be seen at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. Since about 20 years after Monticelli's death, in 1886, he has been an artist shunted to the periphery of art history. He does not qualify as an heroic revolutionary; nor does he fit into any of the dominant school categories that histo- rians have devised to define the mainstream of this period. It has been said that he was a significant influence on both Van Gogh and Cezanne (recognized heroes), but the what, how, and why of his influence has been largely ignored. That Sheon here finally provides the documentation, the hero-connection as it were, would alone make the catalog required reading; but this is almost incidental to the study. Sheon should be read not merely to flesh out the standard art historical positions but, even more, to examine new sets of interactions and influ- ences among apparently isolated artists as dis- parate as Albert Pinkham Ryder, Prendergast, the Nabis, and especially Odilon Redon. An important strain of interest, focused on Monti- celli, is convincingly extended and documented through Matisse and the Fauves, through Sou- tine, whose admiration and absorption of an artist dead before he was born came from the painter Mange. (Sheon's extension to Pollock and De Kooning is less convincing, but one can forgive this excess of enthusiasm in a work that is so valuable and well documented in other respects.) Beginning with an account of the 19th cen- tury Rococo revival in France, and deftly ex- amining the relationship of politics to culture (including a deliciously ironic comparison of the critical attitudes toward the frte galante all but shared by painters of the left, like Courbet, and the academic painters of the right), Sheon goes on to present the rich context of Provencal painting. In seeking to explain the sources of Monticelli, and the odd, fragmented life he led, Sheon has examined the web of friendships- ranging from Ravier, through the Lyonnais Seignemartin, and including Carrand, Vollon, and Vernay-and the role of the provincial masters in turning the direction of landscape painting. Sheon's meticulous research relates the activities of many scarcely studied artists to those better-known men and schools. In doing so, he also provides us with a comprehensive look at art institutions across all of France during a period of rapid institutional develop- ment-a period strikingly similar to that in the U.S. today. The self-conscious struggle for so- phisticated independence from a central art capital waged by the provincial painters and museum or art school directors in 1860s France is much akin to the razor's edge between reign- ing fashion and pride in local tradition that their descendants in Chicago, Los Angeles, Cleveland, or even Houston walk today. Points of agreement are as striking as points of divergence, and always the artistic and painter's sets of values are adroitly situated in the greater intellectual stream of the period. Thus, Sheon relates the park system as devel- oped by Haussmann, crowned by the creation of the Bois de Boulogne, to the concept of the foret magique, itself a nostalgic reinterpretation of the frte galante. At the same time, he care- fully charts the development of the Provenqal Renaissance in the Aix-Marseilles area from its beginnings with Emile Loubon to its zenith with the circle of writers around Mistral. Into this matrix he fits Van Gogh, Cezanne, and Dr. Gachet, and these men are, therefore, better understood. Even our understanding of the sa- lon system is enriched. Sheon weaves all this into a meticulous re- construction of Monticelli's career: his devel- opment, his journeys, his patrons, even his forgers. The result is more than a much-needed monograph. It is a study that brings new illu- mination to almost every important French art event in a period that has already been much examined. The William A.
