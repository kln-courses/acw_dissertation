Lucas and David Zarefsky argued that rhetorical scholars should embrace more pluralistic approaches to the study of public address. In narrating a history of a field he declared to be in "renaissance," Lucas advanced a broad definition of public address as the "study of the full range of public discursive rhetorical acts - historical and contemporary, oral Cara A.

Our goal in this essay is to explore more explicitly what it might mean to "visualize" public address.3 The visual is by no means absent from public address scholarship; indeed, in recent years rhetoric and public address scholars have paid increasing atten- tion to the visual aspects of public address.4 For precisely this reason, it may be time to reflect more deeply about how we research and write about visual politics. A visual turn need not displace the study of public address as talk and text, but it might open up space for richer consideration of the ways that citi- zenship, democracy, and deliberation are constructed in visual culture. In his keynote address at the Seventh Biennial Public Address Conference, Martin J. Medhurst argued for the need to reconfigure public address studies, particularly with regard to doctoral training. Medhurst outlined seven types of expertise that we might cultivate in graduate students, including period exper- tise (training in a specific era, such as the American Revolution), textual exper- tise (devotion to one rich text or set of texts that warrant extended study, such as the Declaration of Independence), and genre expertise (attention to specific types of public address, such as presidential rhetoric or the rhetoric of war).5 None of Medhurst's seven categories directly engaged the question of exper- tise in terms of visuality, though they certainly might have. If, as Medhurst observed, Stephen E. Lucas possesses expertise in the American Revolution, then so too does Lester Olson, whose studies of "rhetorical iconography" (one of which we review here) explore the complex visual politics of the early American republic.6 In a similar vein, Medhurst's notions of "textual" and "genre" expertise might be reframed to allow for the recognition of rich visual discourses as well. Thus we might speak of graduate students' cultivation of expertise in a specific visual archive, such as the Farm Security Administration (FSA) photography project, or in mediated genres such as documentary or television.7 Yet attention to visuality involves more than simply the addition of the arti- facts of visual culture to our critical repertoires, as the scholarship we review in this essay illustrates. The books we take up here represent a range of fields in which one might locate scholarship on the visual aspects of public address, including art history, history, literary and cultural studies, and rhetorical stud- ies. The authors engage a variety of visual discourses, from photography, film, printmaking, engraving, and lithography to rhetorics of space, place, and</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 491 body. Read collectively, this work embodies three challenges that typically face scholars engaging the visual: the complexities of working with multimodal archival material;8 the difficulty of constructing context-rich analyses that pay suitable attention to technologies of vision; and the importance of accounting for the circulation of visual rhetorics. In this essay we illustrate how these chal- lenges manifest themselves in the work of six scholars attempting, in various ways, to visualize public address. An eclectic archive informs David Lubins Shooting Kennedy: JFK and the Culture of Images , which deftly illuminates the visual rhetoric of political mythmaking. Lubin, the Charlotte C. Weber Professor of Art at Wake Forest University, takes up the iconic images and other visual fragments of postwar America that contributed to the construction of the Kennedy mythos. He is careful to establish from the outset that the book is not so much about Kennedy as it is about the visual culture that produced Kennedy, "the dialectic in postwar America between self-gratification and public obligation, between popular culture and history" (x). Ultimately, Shooting Kennedy addresses the dynamic interplay between public and private, desire and duty, image and icon as these tensions manifested themselves in the luminous faces of Jack and Jackie, the frozen frames of the Zapruder film, and the poignant performance of John- John at his father's funeral. According to Lubin, our experience of the Kennedy era, both then and now, is based upon the ways that viewers have experienced such fragments: "Our perceptions of JFK and his era, not to men- tion our own, rely entirely upon endlessly replicated and infinitely elastic chains of images from art, literature, and the media that constantly inform us, often in contradictory ways, of who we are, who we ought to be, and where we belong" (xiii). Lubins argument unfolds across eight chapters. Each chapter takes up as visual touchstones one or two images from the familiar Kennedy narrative: the emergence of the bachelor senator onto the public stage, his courtship of and marriage to Jacqueline Bouvier, his role as president. The events of the assas- sination are slowed to a freeze-frame across several chapters that take up the now iconic images of that week: the Kennedys' sparkling arrival at Love Field in Dallas on November 22, 1963; the moment of the shooting itself, immor- talized by Abraham Zapruder in perhaps the most notorious 26 seconds ever put on film; the aftermath of the assassination with the swearing in of Lyndon Johnson; and John Junior's famous salute to his father outside St. Matthew's Cathedral. The book's organization is loosely chronological, but within each of the chapters Lubin moves widely among a variety of visual images and cultural artifacts of the era. Indeed, one of Lubin's achievements is the way he simulta- neously pays attention to the endless and inevitably fragmented circulation of</page><page sequence="4">492 Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs the Kennedy myth while offering rich readings of individual images. This is no small critical feat. Lubin works to de-mythologize the images by placing them in the context of the broader visual culture of which they were a part. Yet even as he challenges the myths themselves, Lubin reinscribes their iconic status through the sheer performative force of his masterful readings. Nowhere is this more evident than in Lubin's analysis of Life magazine's July 20, 1953, cover photograph of the bachelor senator and his bride-to-be sailing in the waters off Hyannisport. Chapter 2, "Gentle Be the Breeze, Calm Be the Waves," argues that the Life cover image embodies the complex relationship between sex and politics that emerged in the Kennedy years by enacting a provocative dialectic of freedom and constraint. Lubin begins with a close study of the image itself. The newly engaged couple, perched on a sailboat near the Kennedy family compound at Hyannisport, glows with innocent sexuality. Jack is barefoot, tan, rakishly handsome yet self-contained; Jackie is beaming, sexy, confident yet submissive. Lubin works his way around the image skill- fully, exploring light, line, body position, and gaze. In content and form, the photograph is reminiscent for Lubin of Winslow Homer's 1876 painting Breezing Up (A Fair Wind), echoing as it does the earlier picture's New England ideal of freedom and ease. Yet a close analysis of the photograph is only the beginning, for Lubin goes on to situate the image in the context of the visual culture in which Life mag- azine readers of 1953 might have experienced it. He concludes that the photo- graph is an image of both freedom and constraint. The freedom of the sea, of the upper class, of the sexually attractive and alluring, clash with the social constraints facing the couple, including the gendered expectations circulating around Jackie's future and the sexual constraints placed upon the freewheel- ing senator by his overbearing father (who, Lubin speculates, likely purchased this Life cover story to further his son's political career). Arguing against the popular belief that the 1950s were politically asexual, Lubin makes his case about the image recursively, leaving and then returning to the photograph again and again to show how the visual culture of the early 1950s was utterly steeped in sexual politics. He notes that just a few months after the Life cover appeared, Hugh Hefner launched Playboy magazine; that same summer, Alfred Kinsey published Sexual Behavior in the Human Female . Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn (one icon who competed with Jackie and one who looked like her) offered vastly different screen fantasies for moviegoers. Finally, Lubin observes that the constructed political fantasy of Jack and Jackie on the sailboat clashed with the political reality of another famous couple that summer: Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed that June while the sailing Senator Kennedy steered clear of the political fight. Lubin shows how the Life cover photograph of Kennedy and his bride-to-be</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 493 functions synecdochically for a complex dialectic of freedom versus con- straint, thus embodying profound tensions in 1950s politics. While at first some of his choices appear idiosyncratic (what does the Zapruder film have to do with Hitchcock's The Birds*), Lubins free-range interpretation of the Life cover and the other Kennedy images works because he respects both the rhetorical specificity of the images and their place in pub- lic culture. Shooting Kennedy embraces both the specificity and the fluidity of images, offering not a deep archive, but a compellingly broad one supported by skillful attention to historical context and recognition of the complexities of rhetorical circulation. Cecelia Tichi's Embodiment of a Nation: Human Form in American Places uses a similarly broad yet ultimately less fulfilling archive to argue that the national environment consistently has been constructed using a rhetoric of the gendered body. Nations often define themselves by geography. Sites such as Mount Rushmore, Old Faithful, and Waiden Pond - and the literary, visual, and material performances that shape our experience of them - frame our relationships to the environment. Tichi, professor of English and American Studies at Vanderbilt University, aims in the book "to disclose the basis on which a cultural concept - of a geomorphically embodied Nature's nation - persists through historical shifts in sensibility, mentality, and changed social conditions" ( 7) . Tichi grounds the study in the pioneering scholarship of Perry Miller, Annette Kolodny, and others who have written about how Americans construct their relationships to nature. Such a goal should be of interest to those in rhetorical studies interested in rhetorics of the body.9 However, Tichi's archivally rich yet avowedly ahistorical approach may prove frustrating to public address scholars who seek a more historically grounded exploration of the American nation-as-body. Embodiment of a Nation consists of three parts, each of which takes up dif- ferent ways that the trope of the body figures in visual, spatial, and textual dis- courses about the national environment. Part 1, "Crania Americana," explores the role of the "head" in embodying national ideals of autonomy and author- ity at sites such as Mount Rushmore and Waiden Pond. Tichi contends that while discourses about Mount Rushmore emphasize the rationality and wis- dom of "the head," discourses about Waiden Pond, particularly those of the 1960s counterculture, disrupt and challenge that rhetoric. Part 2, "Frontier Incarnations," considers how the frontier has been constructed as both a mas- culine body and a feminine one. Tichi suggests that sites such as Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park offer a body rhetoric that emphasizes masculine activity. Yet the frontier also has feminine qualities, as evidenced by what Tichi calls the discourse of the "erotic frontier" of moon exploration in the 1960s (11). Part 3, "Bon Aqua," takes up the question of gender in another way, via</page><page sequence="6">494 Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs an exploration of the role of water and "water cures" in national environmen- tal history. As Tichi shows in a chapter on representations of health at Hot Springs, Arkansas, on the one hand, water was constructed as having healing, feminine power. Yet by the late twentieth century, discourses about water also took on a more sinister tone when framed in light of the environmental disas- ter at Love Canal, New York. What makes Tichis work engaging is, paradoxically, also that which may make it frustrating to scholars of rhetoric and public address. Like Lubin, Tichi draws upon a rich, eclectic archive, from Martin Luther King Jr. s "I Have a Dream" speech to publicity tracts for water cures to contemporary advertise- ments for Celestial Seasonings tea. Unlike Lubin, however, Tichi s archive is not confined to a relatively narrow historical time frame. Tichi is more inter- ested in understanding how the body rhetoric of "Nature's nation" persists over time, and across multiple domains of expression, than she is in situating any individual instance of environmental body rhetoric in a specific rhetorical context. Tichi herself admits to the ahistorical nature of her study; in fact, she argues that this orientation is appropriate because the national rhetoric of the body is itself ahistorical: "The anthropomorphic America is ahistorical, really history-proof. Anthropomorphism collapses temporal and spatial boundaries, as between historical periods and between primitives and sophisticates, and thus lends itself to the formulation of 'Nature's nation' as a prevalent para- digm" (9). For Tichi, the ahistorical nature of "Nature's nation" obviates the need to attend to the kind of rhetorical specificity to which public address scholars may be accustomed. Ironically, however, the book works best when it does precisely this more concrete work of rhetorical history. In her chapter on Hot Springs, Arkansas, Tichi contends that scholars typically have not understood how American waters have been conceptualized as female. She begins by situating historically public discourse about Hot Springs, which was framed as a gendered space embodying the health and femininity of the goddess Hygeia. Tichi's Hot Springs archive includes images and texts from newspapers, magazines, gov- ernment reports, and tourist pamphlets, which are mobilized to illustrate "the Hot Springs identity, including its gendering and embodiment as female" (181). Yet although some portions of the text, like the chapter on Hot Springs, situate discourses of the national body in the rhetorical contexts out of which they emerged and in which they gained power, the book as a whole largely dis- avows such historicization. Helen Langa, a professor of art history at American University, uses a nar- rower but deeper archive in her examination of the rise of printmaking dur- ing the 1930s. In Radical Art: Printmaking and the Left in 1930s New Yorky the narrow focus of her archive allows Langa to situate the "social viewpoint" art</page><page sequence="7">Book Reviews 495 not only within the context of 1930s radical politics, but also in the context of art production. While the government invested in art for the people through the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project, artists and art deal- ers in the 1930s invented new techniques and new marketing strategies to get people interested in art. Langa argues that the artists' excitement to bring their art to the people paralleled government and societal desires to promote "cul- tural democracy." Langa's work is not just a catalog of a 1930s art form, but rather an interpretation of that art through a careful study of the cultural and political contexts that framed its production and circulation. The book is divided into six chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 describe the histor- ical and political context in which artists created their projects. Two simulta- neous developments spurred printmaking in the 1930s. The emergence of small local markets for leftist artists established the credibility of printmaking, while the Federal Art Project's Graphic Arts Division offered the technological facilities for greater production of images. Langa argues that New Deal admin- istrators appropriated the leftist proletarian rhetoric of the artists. Artists merged Marxist idealism with their art; they were interested in changing pub- lic opinion about poverty, labor exploitation, and racial injustice. New Deal administrators wanted to promote what they called "cultural democracy." Langa argues that the New Deal framed the promise of cultural democracy in the visual arts by emphasizing progressive ideals of socialist improvement, appropriating leftist ideas of art as weapon, and supporting regionalist efforts to suppress local values and reject modernism. Proponents of cultural democ- racy ran into problems, however, including the lack of understanding or inter- est from working-class viewers, artists' misidentification of their audience, the audience's own lack of visual literacy, and technological limitations in the pro- duction of prints. The technological limitations were the hardest to overcome. Langa observes that the number of prints available to the public was limited by the technology. Artists did, however, try to address the other problems in several ways, including employing stylistic choices that simplified the art. The next three chapters of the book take up specific issues that printmakers addressed in their work: labor, racism, and war and fascism. Regarding labor, Langa argues that the lack of previous portrayals of labor themes left artists to make up their own iconologies. Printmakers were not just reproducing or reit- erating leftist propaganda, which is often how critics discuss this work. Rather, Langa concludes that artists negotiated complex and changing rhetorics about the meaning of labor in modern society. In chapter 4, Langa addresses the antiracism themes of prints in which artists sought to make the issues of racial prejudice more vivid and immediate for viewers. For example, Langa situates her examination of antilynching images within the broader context of the work of the NAACP and other interracial organizations against lynching, as well as</page><page sequence="8">496 Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs other works of antilynching art. Within this political context, she also analyzes individual images. For example, she describes the artists' use of contrasting spaces of light and dark, as well as the grotesque ways in which the artists posi- tioned the lynched body to illustrate the terrible injustices facing African Americans. Thus Langa shows how the "artists promoted antiracist values by portraying African American individuals and cultural experiences in ways that resisted the stereotypical qualities too often linked to black identity in the 1930s" ( 165). Finally, Langa catalogs the different ways artists responded to war and fas- cism. Langa points out that an "unusual number of artists responded to inter- national issues, both by addressing them in their art and also by organizing demonstrations, conferences, and fund-raising events" (167). In response to these international issues, artists created images that caricatured fascist leaders, protested war, and highlighted the Spanish Civil War's horrors and heroes. Langa argues that "by mid-decade, artists who followed international politics were increasingly worried that fascist militarism would inevitably lead to wide- spread, devastating wars" (175). Their art reflected this concern with a shift toward even more frightening and vicious portrayals of fascist leaders like Hitler, Hirohito, and Mussolini. In the conclusion, Langa traces printmakings decline by the early 1940s. Langa points to several things that contributed to this decline, including the fear of dissent following the United States' entry into World War II. Additionally, during these years the federal arts projects came under sustained fire, while efforts to create a permanent federal art agency were unsuccessful. Langa moves smoothly between contextualizing the artists and their work within the broader social and political milieu and analyzing the images them- selves. Langa is also explicitly interested in the circulation of the images she examines. For example, she notes that the magazine New Masses was a great archival discovery because there are not many prints about war and fascism in existing large public collections. For Langa, circulation is also an issue of audi- ence. She points to the need to include viewers' perceptions in the analysis of images in order to understand how the images were taken up, understood, and used by audiences in their time. "Art for art's sake" was not the goal of New Deal administrators and the artists. Instead, artists desired that their art would teach; thus there was a need to teach audiences to read the art. Langa argues, "the relevance of social viewpoint themes depends on both creation and reception; it exists not in the artist's intention alone but also in viewers' skills in reading iconographie clues and relating them to historical and ideological contexts" (88). Finally, Langa reminds us of the role technology plays in the circulation of images when she discusses the complexities of printmaking as a medium. She analyzes the conditions of both production and reproduction of the images, and points to the need to understand circulation in part through the technologies that make the visual available.</page><page sequence="9">Book Reviews 497 Gregory M. Pfitzer acknowledges in the introduction to Picturing the Past : Illustrated Histories and the American Imagination , 1840-1900 that his interest in the project was fueled by his own desire to collect pictorial histories; the book, in fact, relies on an archive he has been building since graduate school. Pfitzer, professor of American studies at Skidmore College, studies the popu- lar pictorial histories that circulated widely in America during the last half of the nineteenth century in order to analyze "the ways in which the interaction of visual images and printed words determined the kind and intensity of his- tory Americans absorbed" (xiii). Although Pfitzer contextualizes the pictorial histories within a longitudinal narrative of technological innovation, he unfortunately does little to interpret the images in this remarkably rich archive. In part 1, Pfitzer describes the technological as well as social developments that allowed illustrated histories to become popular. Developments in the mechanics of engraving, like electrotyping (the creation of a wax plate from an original engraving that was then covered in a thin sheet of metal) and steel line engraving, allowed for a greater durability of images. These images, particu- larly ones made from steel line engraving, could withstand the repetitive print- ing required for mass production. Additionally, new techniques in papermaking made it possible to mass-produce images and text. Pfitzer argues that these technological developments allowed for the rise of the pictorial his- tory. The first pictorial histories were marketed as teaching tools for those unable to read but who needed to learn American history: children and immi- grants. Pfitzer argues that as the pictorial histories gained in popularity, pub- lishers privileged the visual over text and, ultimately, gave authority to the visual. Popular presses did the early work of establishing illustrated books as a successful medium for history; however, such publishers were less worried about quality and more interested in making money. Part 2 analyzes the illustrated histories themselves. Pfitzer discusses the dif- ferent forms illustrated histories took, as well as highlights the difficulties of the form. Illustrated histories lent themselves to a particular way of telling the story of history; often, fidelity was sacrificed for rhetorical effect. Pfitzer notes that the language of the illustrated histories was allegorical and observes that sentimentalism permeated every aspect of the books. One example is the work of Jesse Spencer, whose three-volume History of the United States was made obsolete by the Civil War three years after its publication. Spencer chose to add a fourth volume in which, as Pfitzer describes, Spencer argued that the Civil War "was the grand fulfillment of centuries of struggle on behalf of liberty and against the malevolent forces of tyranny" (101). Illustrations in this fourth vol- ume were as grandiose as Spencer's language in that they heroicized military figures and romanticized death-moment battlefield scenes.</page><page sequence="10">498 Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs In part 3, Pfitzer catalogs the challenges publishers of the pictorial histories faced, which ultimately resulted in their disappearance as a medium for telling the story of history. In particular, Pfitzer describes the substantial role played by photography in the disappearance of illustrated histories. The realism and apparent accuracy of photographs impressed people and changed the way illustrations were viewed. Pfitzer argues further that fear of the seductive qual- ities of visual images, combined with the professionalization of history, led to the rejection of pictorial histories by historians and the public. Pfitzer has a rich archive of image texts available to him, and the book is lavishly illustrated. However, Pfitzer does not take up images for extended interpretation. Pfitzer argues in the beginning of the book that the images used in the pictorial histories were not meant by the publishers to challenge, engage, or subvert the ideas in the written text; instead, they were selected to represent the written word in a denotative sense (5). However much Pfitzer himself may doubt that the images are purely denotative, he does not take advantage of the opportunities for deeper analysis. For example, one image features the allegorical figure of Columbia pointing into a distant landscape in which moments of American history are visualized, including the making of the Liberty Bell, the landing of Columbus in the new world, and the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago (160). In one hand she holds a torch, in the other a copy of the Declaration of Independence. It is a rich, evocative image, one just begging for interpretation, but Pfitzer does not take it up. He privi- leges instead the importance of technological innovation as the driving force of his narrative. While Pfitzer compellingly demonstrates how technology enabled and constrained the production and circulation of the pictorial histo- ries, and thus illustrates the utility of attending to technology in the context of visual discourse, his study is constrained by limited critical engagement with the images themselves. Rhetorical scholars who have taken up the study of visual images have tended to emphasize precisely that which Pfitzer tends to neglect: the close study of visual and rhetorical features of specific images placed in context. Lester Olson's Benjamin Franklin's Vision of American Community: A Study in Rhetorical Iconology combines close analysis of a rich archive with skillful con- text building to offer readers a study in rhetorical circulation that takes seri- ously the role of images in the early American public sphere. Benjamin Franklin was many things, including a maker of images. He cre- ated some of the most frequently circulated emblems of the colonial era and early republic, such as his well-known "JOIN, or DIE" emblem depicting the American colonies as a segmented snake. Olson's meticulously researched book vividly illustrates how Franklin's visual rhetoric indexed changes in his alle- giances and political views over the course of 30 years of government service in</page><page sequence="11">Book Reviews 499 the United States and France. Benjamin Franklin's Vision of American Community shares much with Olson's earlier work in terms of its admirable depth of analysis and attention to an international archive of primary source materials. But this study also offers something new. First, by focusing specifi- cally upon the visual production of one highly influential individual, Olson sit- uates Franklin's image production in the broader context of his social thought, providing history and rhetoric scholars with fuller insight into the rhetorical practices of a figure who has been called the first quintessential American. As Olson himself puts it, the value of such a study "lies, primarily, in the historical understanding to be gained by seeing how he [Franklin] changed his images and ideas about America with the dramatically transformed political, social, and economic circumstances during the Revolutionary era between 1754 and 1784, one of the most dynamic periods in America's past" (10). In addition, Olson pays sustained attention to rhetorical circulation. By tracking how indi- vidual images were reproduced, circulated, altered, and recirculated (often in ways that Franklin himself did not intend), Olson demonstrates the powerful role that circulation played in the early American republic. The book is divided into three parts. Part 1 introduces both Franklin's visual practices and his early thinking about the nature of the colonial rela- tionship with Britain. These chapters serve as background for the more con- centrated analysis of part 2, where Olson takes up specific visual images and artifacts produced by Franklin. Part 2 engages the production, reproduction, and circulation of four images that, Olson contends, illuminate Franklin's views about America as a "body politic": the "JOIN, or DIE" emblem originally created by Franklin in 1754 in response to the French and Indian War but later widely circulated as an argument about the need for colonial unity against British rule; "MAGNA Brittania: her Colonies REDUC'D," which in 1765-66 depicted the colonies as a woman with severed limbs; "WE ARE ONE," created in 1776 for the Continental currency; and the 1783 "Libertas Americana" medal, created and distributed by Franklin to commemorate American victo- ries over the British at Yorktown and Saratoga. Part 3 constitutes a conclusion of sorts in which Olson engages Franklin's verbal rhetoric about the colonies and the new republic and includes a fascinating final chapter in which Olson takes up Franklin's opposition to the selection of the bald eagle as the national symbol and contextualizes Franklin's famous objection that the bald eagle is "a bird of bad moral Character" (232). Although we appreciate the way Olson illuminates the rhetorical practices of a canonical figure of the early American republic, we are particularly inter- ested in the second aspect of Olson's study mentioned above: its attention to rhetorical circulation. Olson offers a highly detailed, impeccably researched and documented study of the complexities of circulation in this period. For</page><page sequence="12">500 Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs example, Olson observes that Franklin created the "JOIN, or DIE" emblem to serve as a commentary on the need for colonial unity during the French and Indian War. In this capacity the image was widely circulated both in the colonies and in Britain. According to Olson, "JOIN, or DIE" - produced by Franklin in 1754 - was the earliest production of an image of colonial unity produced by a colonist in America (28). The image - circulated widely in both the northern and the southern colonies - was meant to promote alliances among all colonies in the face of opposition from the French. Ten years later, the motif reappeared in the context of public deliberations about the Stamp Act. "JOIN, or DIE" proved an ambiguous, and thus supple, illustration of the need for colonial unity - this time, not against the French, but against British colonial rule. For each instance of the image's (re)appropriation and (recir- culation, Olson tracks not only the social and political context of each of these moments, but also audience responses in both the colonies and in Britain. He turns to an impressive array of archival materials, including colonial and British newspapers, diaries and letters of Franklin and his contemporaries both in the colonies and abroad, and the various instantiations of the image itself. As a result, the reader gets a vivid picture of the ways in which this par- ticular image came to mean across multiple contexts and over time. Olson's book embodies the best of rhetorical history in that it oscillates productively between close studies of rhetorical discourse and reconstruction of the com- plex rhetorical cultures out of which such discourses emerge and through which they circulate. Up to this point we have engaged scholarship that is interested in examining how certain artifacts, images, or spaces make political and social issues visible. The final text we review, by contrast, takes up the rhetorical functions of visibil- ity itself. In FDR's Body Politics : The Rhetoric of Disability, rhetoric scholars Davis W. Houck and Amos Kiewe examine the rhetorical work done by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his close advisors in Roosevelt's gubernatorial and presi- dential campaigns. Houck and Kiewe's goal is at first glance a simple one: they seek to answer the question of how Roosevelt was able to become president despite his very visible disability. However, FDR's Body Politics is ultimately about something much more complex: the rhetorical functions of visibility itself. Roosevelt's body rhetoric was both oratorical and visual. Houck and Kiewe argue that Roosevelt and his advisors transformed his body in the eyes of the American public through words and images, thus convincing the public that he was fit for public office. The authors expand the scope of rhetorical under- standings of Roosevelt beyond the spoken and written word to argue that bod- ies matter and furthermore that "Presidential bodies matter most of all" (xi). Houck and Kiewe begin by telling the story of Roosevelt's illness, the days following the onset of infantile polio, and his efforts to rebuild his body and</page><page sequence="13">Book Reviews 501 his political career. From the beginning those around Roosevelt, as well as Roosevelt himself, worked to manage the information and images given to the media and even to certain members of Roosevelt's family. Both he and his advisors managed the public nature of his illness quite successfully. For exam- ple, Roosevelt's carefully scripted performance at the 1924 Democratic National Convention was widely viewed as a political and personal triumph. The authors argue that Roosevelt's performance at the 1924 convention marked a first effort at a physical and therefore political comeback. Later chapters trace with great archival detail the 1928 gubernatorial cam- paign, Roosevelt's years as governor, and his presidential campaigns. Roosevelt campaigned for just four weeks for the office of governor of New York. During this campaign, Roosevelt had to fight against Republican claims that he was too ill to govern. Roosevelt chose, as he would in the future, to emphasize vis- ibility to combat these claims. Houck and Kiewe note that Roosevelt and his aides vigilantly monitored media outlets and strove to correct false impres- sions about Roosevelt's health with "an elaborate media campaign that emphasized visibility and physicality" (58). In chapter 5, Houck and Kiewe describe the whisper campaign that pre- ceded the 1932 Democratic National Convention and Roosevelt's efforts to quiet that campaign. This time, Roosevelt utilized a friendship with a writer, Earle Looker, to launch a national campaign to address concerns about Roosevelt's health and fitness. The authors describe Roosevelt's work with Looker, Looker's writings about Roosevelt, and media and public response to Looker's work. While this public relations campaign resulted in the successful national circulation of arguments regarding Roosevelt's fitness to lead, Houck and Kiewe also note that it was emblematic of Roosevelt's increasing dissatis- faction with media portrayals of his health. This campaign marked Roosevelt's first effort at putting his own message out to the media under a veneer of jour- nalistic objectivity. In chapters 6 and 7, Houck and Kiewe describe the visual campaign Roosevelt enacted to show his body to the public. The authors detail Roosevelt's airplane flight to Chicago to accept the Democratic Party's nomi- nation for president in 1932. At a time when air travel was risky at best, Roosevelt was able to make himself visible to delegates and thus convey his health and vitality. One of the most significant performances of visibility was Roosevelt's tour to the west coast and back by railroad. The authors argue Roosevelt was worried that the casual reader would not believe the campaign's propaganda, so Roosevelt literally took his body on the road. During the gru- eling train tour, Roosevelt delivered 56 speeches in 20 days. However, the authors contend that the bulk of the rhetorical work of the train tour was not verbal, but rather visual. The purpose of the speeches was not to say a lot, but</page><page sequence="14">502 Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs rather to be seen a lot. Roosevelt worked to make his disability invisible by making his body visible. In mounting a convincing narrative about Roosevelt's rhetorical body, Houck and Kiewe rely on an impressive archive of materials, including the let- ters of Roosevelt and his advisors, public statements, personal notes, newspa- per accounts, and speeches. These materials enable the authors to construct a convincing narrative that describes in detail how advisors framed Roosevelt's fitness to lead both oratorically and visually. One way that the authors might have expanded their discussion of Roosevelt's visibility would have been to take up the question of how Roosevelt's body was figured in other contexts. Scholars have long noticed, for example, that Roosevelt was often figured in editorial cartoons as a strong, masculine figure, with prominent legs; in these contexts he was almost always depicted standing or striding. Houck and Kiewe leave the relationship between such images and the campaigns' rhetorical mobilization of FDR's body unexplored. While such an exploration might be beyond the authors' goals in this book, it would be provocative. The presence of such representations of Roosevelt might not only have signaled the "suc- cess" of the campaign to emphasize his vigor, it might also indicate complicity on the part of audiences, which may already have desired to replace Roosevelt's body with one more socially acceptable, thus making the advisors' task eas- ier.10 Overall, Houck and Kiewe's readings of the literal circulation of Roosevelt's body should cause public address scholars to think more deeply about the relationship between rhetorical practice and visibility. Although Lubin, Tichi, Langa, Pfitzer, Olson, and Houck and Kiewe come from a variety of disciplines, take up a variety of artifacts and practices, and pursue different goals, their scholarship suggests three challenges facing schol- ars who wish to visualize public address. The first of these are the conceptual and pragmatic challenges facing scholars who work with visual archives. All of the authors whose work we engage here mobilize rich archival research in their analyses. And each likely was faced with the conceptual problem of how to strike an appropriate balance between depth and breadth. In light of one's research questions, which should the scholar privilege? Does one say less about more material, or more about less material? As we have seen, Lubin and Tichi mobilize perhaps the most promiscuous set of archival materials in a way that may seem to sacrifice critical depth for breadth. Such a sacrifice, we argued, was less problematic in Lubin's case, because he constructs arguments around the Kennedy archive that justify breadth while at the same time controlling its "spread." By contrast, Olson and Langa do something of the opposite. Although he pays attention to the multiple iterations of Franklin's work, Olson begins with only four original images from Franklin's visual oeuvre. Unlike Lubin and Tichi, then, Olson's primary source archive is incredibly deep,</page><page sequence="15">Book Reviews 503 enabling him to address not only the nature of Franklin's visual rhetoric but also the nature of rhetorical circulation itself. Such conceptual choices about breadth versus depth necessarily enable or constrain these scholars in particu- lar ways and frame their critical reading and viewing practices. Researchers face not only conceptual challenges from the archive, but also more pragmatic ones. Indeed, the practical challenges of working in visual archives haunt each of these texts. Such ghosts are perhaps most obvious in the acknowledgments sections of the books, in which grateful authors hint at the vagaries of working in archives and detail grants received and sabbaticals taken. While such experiences are common to any scholar doing substantive archival research, working with visual data poses a number of unique (and, sometimes, literally costly) challenges to the researcher. Image acquisition can be expensive, reproduction difficult to negotiate, permissions and copyright questions thorny and confusing. While such seemingly bureaucratic concerns should not dissuade exploration of visual rhetoric, these concerns have the potential in some cases to influence what we study and color our experience of doing research.11 Thus what is only implicit in these scholars' work must be acknowledged more explicitly: taking up the task of visualizing public address may also mean entering a new world of rewarding but occasionally frustrating research experiences. The work we review above suggests a second challenge facing scholars who work with visual discourse: how to account for the role of technology. Technologies of communication, of course, enable or constrain the movement of rhetorical discourse, and critics must be aware of that. But just as impor- tant, critics who do not cultivate technical knowledge about the visual dis- courses they study may constrain their own ability to mobilize meaningful interpretations. Central to Langas argument about 1930s printmaking, for example, is a technical understanding of artists' practices as well as recognition of the constraints and limitations inherent in the reproduction and circulation of their work. Pfitzer details how transformations in technologies of image and book production impacted the types and quality of illustrated histories that circulated across the nineteenth century. Situating visual discourse "in context," then, means not only acknowledging the role of technology, but knowing something about how specific technologies work. The works reviewed here illustrate the benefits of building attention to technologies of vision into our sense of what "counts as context" in public address scholarship. The final challenge suggested by these works is the challenge of accounting for the circulation of visual discourse. Despite its utter ubiquity in public cul- ture, circulation remains undertheorized in rhetorical studies. However, as many of the authors reviewed here demonstrate, circulation does not go unre- marked upon in historical-critical work. Olson, for example, makes circulation</page><page sequence="16">504 Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs a key focus of his engagement with the Franklin images and artifacts. Lubin makes something of a reverse move in that he studies not how the Kennedy images circulated, but the visual discourses that circulated around the Kennedy images. And Houck and Kiewe take up the literal circulation of President Roosevelt's body in order to illustrate how Roosevelt and his handlers worked to visualize Roosevelt's health. By combining analysis of visual artifacts in all their specificity with attention to circulation, each of these authors illustrates the fruitfulness of attending to the movements of visual rhetoric. In exploring the various challenges faced by these scholars of visual politics, we have sought to illustrate the potential difficulties as well as the rewards of making a visual turn in public address studies. We suggested at the outset of this essay that visualizing public address need not involve a setting aside of the textual and oratorical artifacts typically engaged by public address scholars. But adapting our critical practices to the challenges of the visual may give us a richer sense of the forms and functions of rhetoric as well as a deeper under- standing of the historical role of visuality in public culture.

For example, many publishers resist reproducing images in color because the expense may mean production of a book out of the financial reach of its intended audience. Yet it may be exceedingly important to the researcher that readers be able to see the images in color.</page></plain_text>
