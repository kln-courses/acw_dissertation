<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROBBE-GRILLET, ALAIN. For a New Novel. Translated by Richard Howard. New York: Grove Press, 1966. Pp. 175. $3.95. This little book is a translation of the miscellaneous arti- cles written between 1955 and 1963 and collected for pub- lication by Les Editions de Minuit by Robbe-Grillet him- self. They constitute an indispensable companion volume to Robbe-Grillet's fiction and cinema-fiction; and, more broadly, an important apology for the nouveau roman, in a more immediate sense than Michel Butor's two volumes of Repertoire, which range more widely and more urbanely over the various provinces of literature. The American translation, done with skill and precision, offers the reader a supplementary bonus: five pages of Selected Bibliography. The only (minor) flaw in this bibliography is the omission of Robbe-Grillet's cind-roman L'Immortelle, Paris, Les Editions de Minuit, 1963. It should be noted that Richard Howard has done all the previous translations from Robbe- Grillet for Grove Press, and his long-standing familiarity with the requirements of Robbe-Grillet's prose has stood</page><page sequence="2">576 BOOK REVIEWS him in good stead for rendering the sobriety of the present volume of essays. The dust jacket carries on its back a photograph of Robbe-Grillet leaning enigmatically over a highly polished table that produces one of those mirror images that Robbe- Grillet first began to explore in the early fifties (cf. the "Visions reflechies" of his Instantangs) and which gave the impetus to his new technique. Robbe-Grillet is a man fascinated by such reflected visions, and his essays are attempts to justify the new novel as an enterprise in the subjective recording of viewed surfaces; he is also perhaps fascinated by the phenomenon of reflection itself, but tells us nothing about this problem in his essays. In this sense, he may be looked upon as a Valdry turned inside out: what is abstract in Valery becomes relentlessly concrete in Robbe-Grillet: Monsieur Teste has become Monsieur le Voyeur, or better yet, Monsieur X. But one curious co- incidence remains between these polarities of Valery and Robbe-Grillet: they are both-along with every other major twentieth century artist-constructivists. The reader should not begin by expecting too much from these essays; there is sufficient evidence in the essays them- selves that Robbe-Grillet does not want them overrated. This volume is not The Art of the New Novel, nor its Theory; it is simply a very straightforward and honest dis- cussion of what Robbe-Grillet's fiction is all about. There is more "theory" in Butor's Rgpetoire; and there is a more precise sense of the tradition and the problems of the con- temporary novel in Nathalie Sarraute's L'Ere du souppon. But there is a quality of common sense and even of tenta- tiveness here that is not quite found in Robbe-Grillet's more learned fellow-apologists. Nor will the reader find much "growth" in this present volume; there is a certain amount of progressive clarification in moving chronologically from the first important essay, "A Future for the Novel" (1956) to the most ambitious one, "Nature, Humanism, Tragedy" (1958) to the excellent "Time and Description in Fiction Today" (1963) and the succinct summarizing of "From Realism to Reality" (1955/63); but there is very little approfondissement, partly explicable by the fact that Robbe- Grillet appears to have a Pascalian kind of aversion to profondeur. The few shorter essays on other writers (Rous- sel, Svevo, Bousquet, Beckett, Pinget) are interesting primarily because of Robbe-Grillet's discovery of affinities with these writers; the Beckett essay, which surprisingly enough deals with Beckett's first two stage works, is quite perceptive. It is unfortunate that we do not have more examples of Robbe-Grillet's personal and professional reactions to other writers; we ought to have lengthy essays at least on Flaubert and Kafka, even if those essays were merely in the form of temoignages. These two writers, in my opinion, are the major ingredients of Robbe-Grillet's craft: Flaubert, for insisting that his novels should be about "nothing" (more applicable to the novel of the future than to Flau- bert's own work, except perhaps Bouvard et Pkcuchet); and Kafka, for his uncanny sense of a precisely documented "reality" from which we are totally alienated. All the other "influences" on Robbe-Grillet-Balzac, Joyce, Faulkner, Proust, Beckett, the detective story, Graham Greene, and possibly Surrealist fiction-are important seasonings, but not basic ingredients. Robbe-Grillet's claim to serious attention lies in the fact that since his "Visions riflichies," since The Erasers, he has consistently pursued a narrow and precarious path defined by himself in "A Future for the Novel" and achieved a strange kind of purification in his constructions and even in his expression (if this word is applicable to a writer who abhors all metaphorical litera- ture as being falsely anthropomorphic and deceptively humanistic); his three finest achievements, Jealousy, In the Labyrinth and Last Year at Marienbad, bear this out. The admirer of Robbe-Grillet's explorations (like Butor, he thinks of the novel as an instrument of "recherche") will, in all likelihood, not find the answer to the questions that interest him most: Robbe-Grillet is either not able or not ready to articulate the answers. In a sense, he has presented the problems to the best of his ability in his novels and cine-romans. What we would really like to know is the source and the significance of Robbe-Grillet's fascination (and our own, too, as readers of his novels) with the obsessive emo- tional states of his characters and the hypnotic effect of those bizarre geometrical and at the same time labyrinthine topographies. This curious creative tension in Robbe- Grillet between the positivistic or phenomenological eye and the Jansenist mind-the observation of the world and the recoil from the world-this old-and-new Gnosticism, may have to be left for others to elucidate.
