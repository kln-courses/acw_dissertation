It is purposed in these notes to call attention from time to time to the most important current literature upon anthropological subjects, especially that which bears upon the study of religion. Much of this literature is pub- lished where it is not accessible to the general reader, and it will be the especial aim of these summaries to render that material available. The first series, published in the January 1895 number, included articles and books appearing within the six months, July to December, 1894; this series embraces those from January to June, 1895. Two important papers appear in a recent government publication (Eleventh Annual Refort of the Bureau of Ethnology, i889-i89o, Wash- ington, 1894). "A Study of Siouan Cults," by J. Owen Dorsey, presents a valuable summary of present knowledge in regard to the religious ideas of an important group of tribes. The information concerning the Omahas, Ponkas and their nearest kin is mainly original; that relative to the Mandans, Winnebagoes, lowas, Otoes, Sioux proper and their near relatives is com- piled from various authors. Dorsey claims that the conception of "the great spirit" commonly attributed to Indians is not found among the Siouan peo- ples; nor is that other idea, "the happy hunting ground." Mysterious powers, however, there are in multitude, in earth and air, water and fire. To them prayers are made, gifts given, and tribute rendered. Communion with them may be sought and one to whom revelation has been made gains spirit power. Such form societies and hold prescribed ceremonial meetings. The various spirit powers, the modes of worship, mortuary customs, ideas regarding the dead and the hereafter are given in detail. The sacred num- bers, the practices relating to the cardinal points, the symbolism of colors are all considered. Some form of the "Sun Dance," with its terrible fastings and self-torture, appears to have existed among all Siouan tribes. Dorsey brings together a number of descriptions of these, and adds a curious one, written by a Sioux Indian named Bushotter, illustrated by drawings by its author. The studied avoidance of reference to Catlin's description of the Man- dan Sun Dance strikes an "outsider " as rather childish. - Mrs. Matilda 45</page><page sequence="2">46 THE BIBLICAL WI/ORLD. Coxe Stevenson, in the same report, presents an article upon "The Sia.' Although generally descriptive of this people, the article is more than half devoted to religious matters. Attractively written, it is one of our best studies among the Pueblos. Sia is one of the smallest and poorest of the New Mexican pueblos. Its population speaks a Queres tongue, and is thus related to the people at Cochiti, San Felipe, Santa Domingo, Acoma, Laguna, etc. In this little town, among a poverty-stricken handful of people, Lieutenant Stevenson and his wife began stud), some years ago; Mrs. Stevenson has continued this after her husband's death. The study has been unusually successful. In her paper we have the curious cosmological stories, much information regarding the religious societies, and good description of some of the ceremonials. The illustrations are, many of them, of a remarkable character, and include the sand paintings, the altar arrangements, partici- pants in costume, and some interesting views taken by flash-light in the midst of the ceremonials in the sacred rooms or estufas.- In this connection must be mentioned J. Walter Fewkes' " Comparison of Sia and Tusayan Snake Ceremonials" (Ametrican lAnthlrofologist, April). The Sia material is drawn from Mrs. Stevenson, the Tusavan from his own writings. The cere- monials are compared, stage by stage. While regretting the lack of informa- tion on some points, the author concludes that the ceremonials are parts of related rituals, showing contact and strongly cementing the now widely separated and linguistically dissimilar eastern and western groups of pueblos. Stephen D. Peet, in several articles, refers to a number of matters in North American Indians' religion. In "The Worship of the Rain God" (American Antiquarian, December 1894), he treats of symbolism among southwestern tribes. He studies the cult to "see how many methods of expressing the desire for rain were invented, and to notice the manner in which the rain was personified and symbolized, and how elaborate the cere- monies were which embodied this personification."- In "The Serpent a Symbol of the Rain Cloud" (Ibid., December 1894) he brings together many statements relative to the Pueblo, Navajo, Nahuatl and Maya serpent symbol. He concludes "that the snake was not only a water divinity, but among many of the advanced tribes he was regarded as an anthropomorphic divinity, which personified the rain."- In "Anthropomorphic Divinities" (Ibid., March 1895) he notices the tendency to anthropomorphize the objects of worship Often, plainly, an animal, a plant, or some lifeless thing, it becomes personi- fied. The deified mountain becomes a human being, the rainbow in the Navajo sand paintings is supplied with head and limbs. The author con- siders this tendency "a positive aid to devotion, for it enabled the people to con- ceive of God as a personal being, and to represent him not only as a national deity, but as one who ruled all nations and peoples."- Two articles in the American Antiquarian, March 1895, deal with American cosmogonies. In " The Hidery (sic) Story of Creation" James Deans gives the story of Nekilstlas, the raven, which has been given quite as well elsewhere. A. F.</page><page sequence="3">COMPARA TIVE-RELIGION NOTES. 47 Chamberlain gives some new material from the Kootenay. A desirable work now is the publication, in some easily accessible form, of a good summary of the mythological material of the whole northwest coast, from Eskimo-land to the state of Washington. A great mass has appeared, but it is scattered and in inaccessible journals and reports, in various languages. J. Walter Fewkes continues his notes descriptive of Moki Indian cere- monial in "The Tusayan New Fire Ceremony " (Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist., Vol. XXVI.). This takes place annually in the late fall; the two cele- brations observed both began on November 13. The ceremonial appears to have reference to germination, and in it prayer is made for fertility in fields, in animals and in human beings. The desire for rain is present, of course, and finds expression in request and in symbolic action. Tusayan ritual and mythology are composite; families and clans from different peoples and places have come together in these Arizona pueblos, and have mingled ideas and religions. This shows itself in many ways; thus-a number of earth goddesses appear to be recognized in Moki mythology. To some of these, in this ritual, prayer is made. Of the various features in the ceremonial, the fire-making on the first day, the sacrifices then made to the fire, the curious phallic survivals and drenchings of the celebrants with water and other liquids on the third and fourth days, and the casting of the embers of the sacred fire over the cliff on the fifth -last ceremonial day--are, perhaps, the most interesting. "The Walpi Flute Observance" (Journal of American Folk-lore, October-December 1894). It will be remembered that this ceremony alternates with the Snake Dance, thus occurring once in two years. Dr. Fewkes considers the ceremony an unusually good case of ritualistic dramatization. The description is minutely detailed. No one interested in the native religions of North America can afford to pass by Dr. D. G. Brinton's little "Primer of Mayan Hieroglyphs" (Ginn &amp; Co., Boston, 1895, 8vo, pp. I52). The few codices of the Mayas, which still exist, are largely composed of representations of deities or ceremonials. The graphic system is chiefly a picture-writing, but it also contains many phonetic elements. These are mostly in that transition stage between ideo- grams and phonograms which Dr. Brinton has called "1ikonomatic," or rebus- writing. In his discussion our author recognizes three kinds of characters- mathematical, pictorial, truly graphic. These are separately considered. We still need to learn much before the Maya writings shall be completely understood; but in this Primer we have brought together the present real acquisition from the works of students throughout the world.- In "Analy- sis of the Pictorial Text inscribed on two Palenque Tablets" (Proceedings American Antiquarian Society, October 24, 1894). Philipp J. J. Valentini follows a path marked out by Charles Rau some years ago. He goes, how- ever, much further than his predecessor. Comparing the glyphs of Palenque with the written characters in the codices he reaches a considerable number of satisfactory identifications. The author summarizes his results in a series</page><page sequence="4">48 THE BIBLICAL WORLD. of propositions. Many of the characters are day symbols; these, as written characters, are tachygraIhks, abbreviated from prototypes recognizable in the scriptures; these prototypes represent objects of ritual use; the characters which are not day symbols are mostly simple pictures, also of ritual objects; the method of recording, both on paper and on stone, was not alphabetic, syllabic, or intermixed, but object and picture writing. The author is simple, clear, ingenious. There can be no question that he is correct in most of his conclusions regarding the tablets studied. The codices, however, are proba- bly much later than these tablets, and are marked, perhaps, by more sugges- tion of phonetic writing. An old question is discussed in " Prehistoric Contact of Americans with Oceanic Peoples" (American Antiquarian, March 1895), by Cyrus Thomas. There is at present a strong tendency to deny evidence of such contact. The author notes several similarities which he believes suggest such contact. Curious likenesses exist between the calendar systems of the Malays (Javans) and the Mayas. In both special attention is paid to the four cardinal points, to each of which are assigned a deity, a color, a bird, and a definite group of five days or letters; in both the month numbers twenty days; in both a cen- tral point is recognized among the cardinal points, to which a mixed color is assigned; in both (Javan and Mexican) divisions of time are represented by serpents. Besides noticing the similarity between the calendars Thomas mentions some parallels in etymology and mythology. Thus Hindu cos- mogony and Mayan cosmogony alike refer to three past and a fourth, present, great "age';" some similarity exists between Sesha, the shiny serpent, who in Hindu legend bears up Vishnu (Narayana) on a calm sea, preceding a time of creative energy, and Gugumatz, the plumed serpent, floating on the peaceful watery expanse, before a creation; the monkey, in a special relation to the wind, plays a part in both mythologies; perhaps Vishnu, in his avatar of the boar, may be comparable with the "great hog" mentioned in the ,opol vuh. These points are interesting, and deserve careful investigation rather than abrupt dismissal. Geo. A. Dorsey (Journal of American Folk-lore, October-December 1894), in "A Ceremony of the Quichuas of Peru," describes a propitiator) service performed by modern Indians who were hired to make excavations of the graves of their ancestors. Invocations were made to the spirits of the dead, offerings were given, and responsibility was shifted to the employer. "Chiefs, sons of the sun, you and we are brothers, sons of the great Pachacamac. You only know this, but we know that three persons exist, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. This is the only difference between you and us." . " Chiefs, sons of the sun, we have not come to disturb your tranquil sleep in this your abode. We have come only because we have been com- pelled by our superiors; toward them may you direct your vengeance and your curses." The whole ceremony was a curious mixture of the old and the new religion.</page><page sequence="5">COMPARA TIVE-RELIGION NOTES. 49 Heli Chatelain (Journal of American Folk-lore, October-December 1894), "African Fetichism," combats prevalent opinion. He says: "The term fetich is employed without discrimination. It is of more frequent use in West Africa than in East Africa. On the west coast the word is applied to everything supernatural or reputed to be such, and by extension to everything connected therewith. ..... The more I ascertain and compare original facts, the more am I impressed with the fundamental unity of the religious conceptions of Chinese, Hindus, and American Indians, as well as of nominal Moslems, Jews, and Christians, with the African negro. They all have a dim notion of a Supreme Being; they all serve him far less than they serve the spirits, the mysterious forces of nature, and the souls of deceased persons, and put their trust in amulets, talismans, incantations, quacks, priests, sooth- sayers, spiritists and the thousand and one manifestations and paraphernalia of the one universal disposition of mankind known as superstition." An important place in the ceremonials of the Indian tribes of the South- west is occupied by curious pictures or mosaics made of sand. Different colored sands are procured by pounding up various kinds of rocks. The designs are made by qualified persons, according to a prescribed method, after preparatory purification. Colors and designs are symbolical. In making them the sand taken in the hand is allowed to run out between the thumb and forefinger along the lines to be produced. The practice of making sand mosaics is found among the various pueblo peoples and among the Navajos. In "Hindu and Parsee Sand Painting" (The Archacologist, January) Fewkes calls attention to a similar usage in India. "The sand, called ranguri, is ground from different kinds of rock by an aboriginal people of the Deccan, called Katores, who bring it from the woods and peddle it from house to house, crying, 'ranguri, ranguri' as they go through the streets. The sand is of various colors--orange, purple, red, blue, white, and black." Women are the artists and make the pictures in front of their houses on festal days. Borders, with patterns in semi-circles, crosses, birds, or human figures, are made. The pictures are said to be made to attract good spirits; it is unlucky to step on them. More elaborate designs are made before temples. Sand pictures are also made when offerings are made to guardian spirits of sacred springs or sacred trees. The offerings are left upon them. The Parsees appear to have taken the practice from the Hindu, but use in the operation a mechanical device for sifting the patterns onto the required surface. Designs are made on the thresholds, at the bed, under a cradle, daily; they are also made on festival occasions and anniversaries, and in connection with exor- cism. The whole subject is curious and suggestive. Does not the practice exist among the Katores and other more primitive peoples of India? Sand paintings are today made as a street amusement in Japan. Regamy describes the artist at work: " Then opening bags full of sand of various colors, he takes handfuls from each in turn, sprinkling the sand upon the ground, here, there,-at random it would seem. And soon there comes to view at his feet</page><page sequence="6">50 THE BIBLICAL WIORLD. some beautiful princess in chatoyant garments, some monster in glistening and multi-colored scales, or some ingenious rebus offering to the sagacity of the arrested passers its polychromatic figures." Other writers describe the same thing. Is it not possible that in this street amusement there lingers as a survival a practice once, among the Japanese, serious and significant? It would be interesting to learn if some evidence in this direction exists. C. M. Pleyte, in " Zur Kenntnis der religi6sen Anschauungen der Bataks" (Globuzs, January 1895), interestingly describes a curious mode of divination. The Bataks of the west coast of Sumatra call it the Pa-rmanzuhons. It is used for the discovery of lost articles, to learn the result of disease, to dis- cover whether a war enterprise will terminate happily. The conductor is called a datu;, he is learned in the sorcerers' books. His outfit contains, among other things, a large and peculiar four-cornered basket, a flat tray on which is painted an eight-rayed figure symbolical of the winds of the cardinal points, a mat, a knife, and articles of adornment and of food. When the fates are to be consulted the basket is placed upon the mat; the tray with the eight-point figure is set below it; the various articles are carefully placed, in accordance with fixed rules, in the basket. Taking a live hen in his hand the datu repeats a long invocation in which the gods and spirits are invited to the feast spread for them; he then acquaints the fowl with the subject on which information is wanted, and cutting its neck throws it into the basket, which he immediately covers with a cloth. When fluttering ceases the position of the fowl with reference to the eight-rayed figure is carefully observed: this gives the oracle, which is read from the book or staff of divina- tion and elucidated by the datui. Dr. Pleyte gives the invocation in full. It is a curious myth, explaining the origin not only of this Parmanuilons but also of the various sacred songs, dances and musical instruments. The chief pieces in the outfit of the datu are represented by wood cuts. J. M. Campbell, in "Notes on the Spirit Basis of Belief and Custom" (Indian Antiquary, Bombay, Nov., Dec., 1894, Jan., Feb., March, 1895), brings together a great mass of interesting material. Our author starts by accepting Spencer's dictum that ancestor worship is the rudimentary form of religion; that the first idea of a spirit was the soul of the dead. He studies ancestor worship and claims that the ancestor becomes a guardian; the gallant dead were the guardians of the living; from faith in the family head flowed the great body of guardian spirits. One result of the guardian was to increase the power and fear of unfriendly spirits and to foster magic. One early phase of the guardian theory was the belief that there were guardian animals. These guardian animals were scarers of spirits. Plants and trees (representing ancestors) were also spirit-scarers. All guardians were to be appeased by offerings and might be pleased by blood sacrifice. Choosing of clan badges or symbols grew out of the idea that spirits lived in plants or animals. Spirits, like man, are mortal: they die and pass into powerlessness. They cause diseases. Hence the search for objects to drive them away or</page><page sequence="7">COMlPARA TIVE-RELIGION NOTES. 5 to render them harmless. Such may be worn and become ornaments. Most important among articles used to ward off spirit power, or to drive away spirits are fire, water, iron, and urine. Many less important materials or objects serve similar ends. Such briefly are the author's propositions, to the support of which he brings a great array of facts from all the world. Unfor- tunately no authors are cited except those who write in English (and in Latin and Greek). Of the greatest value is the enormous quantity of material from the peoples of India; this has been culled from sources quite inaccessible to most readers or gathered from original sources or first-hand authority. Two or three parts of the matter appear to us of unusual interest. The reverence paid by craftsmen in India to their tools regarded as guardians is curious. Thus the mill is the guardian of the oil maker, musical instruments are wor- shiped as guardians by dancing girls, scales by market gardeners, and the like. Such facts are welcome suggestions to the archaeologist who wonders at the representation of stone hatchets as apparent objects of worship on the monuments of Neolithic man in Europe. Mr. Campbell's study of objects that scare spirits is important. Certain things are worn to ward off spirits. Thus--garlands and necklaces of sweet basil leaves and stems were put about the head or neck, rings of grass were worn on the fingers, fresh heads of rice were placed in the ears,-all as protectors. The cow, and all pertaining to her, being sacred and spirit-scaring, ornaments were worn that were " cow- colored." Knots were spells against evil and knotted cords, necklaces, or ear-ornaments were worn. Other decorations in ivory, beads, palm leaves, were, according to Campbell, of similar origin. When metal was introduced these old ornaments were reproduced in it, but still retain in many cases their old spirit power. The author gives a long list of modern Hindu ornaments, which in name, form or present superstition illustrate his view. The whole subject appears to be original and many interesting questions suggest them- selves in connection with it. Important too is the discussion of iron as a pro- tection against spirits. The citation of facts is good but one wishes that there were more of explanation of how and why and a better arrangement of the material. The data from India, Persia and Burmah regarding the use of urine in the treatment of disease and in controlling or disarming spirits are well marshaled : those from the rest of the world are incomplete and not well put. The author apparently knows nothing of Capt. Bourke's work. These five articles are but the beginning apparently of an extensive treatise. It may be that the author after presenting his material will at the end make general- izations and work out to results. We may not agree with him in his Spen- cerian foundation; we must admire his diligence in bringing together data to support it; we must feel profoundly grateful for his placing at our disposition an unequaled array of facts from India. Andre Lefevre discourses interestingly upon 1" Ende et Virgile" (Revue mensuelle de l'Ecole d'Anthrofologie de Paris March, I895). How came AEneas, a man of another and a defeated people, to figure as the ancestor of</page><page sequence="8">52 THE BIBLICAL WORLD. the Caesars and the remote founder of Rome, and to be associated with a purely Italian goddess of the woods and springs ? The conception of AEneas is followed from the beginning. At first he is but a "qualificative" of Aph- rodite-a quality of the sun. He then naturally came to be the son of the goddess. Finally "cet adjectif est devenu le pere des Romains." The con- ception of Venus is then traced; at first a wood nymph, guardian of the springs, she becomes in time goddess of love, the universal mother. By the time the Trojan fugitive, adopted in a fashion as a semi-divine hero, needs Latin connections, she has risen to such importance that she naturally becomes his mother. Before Virgil,--Na~vius, Ennius and Cato had given definite- ness to the story. In his AEneid the great poet gathered the elements together and constructed his epic. Never was stroke made at better time. The foe of Greece, fugitive from Troy, seducer at Carthage, child of the universal mother, savior of the palladium and of the Penates-- Eneas at last reached the highest point and became founder of the Julian line, the father of the Romans. In all religions there is a constant tendency among the common people to narrate in all seriousness, with much detail, imaginary incidents and events in the life of the founder of the religion. When stories of this sort are told of Buddha or Mohammed we smile at their childish or ridiculous character. Fewv realize that quantities of such stories are told among peasants in many Christian lands. 0. Colson (Wallonia, Sept., Dec., 1894), in a series of articles - " Jsus et St. Pierre," brings together a number of curious stories of Belgian peasants regarding the travels of Christ and his impetuous disciple. In these stories Peter is ever idle, discontented, a grumbler, and a liar; in most of them he is finally repentant and anxious to atone for his folly. The Lord is represented as ever kind and long suffering, often apparently deceived, but he usually, in the end, humiliates his dissatisfied and insolent follower and inculcates a moral lesson. To us almost profane, it is certain that no irrever- ence was intended by those among whom the stories arose. Common people everywhere need to make the being they worship very like themselves-he must live where they live, do as they might do, think and act as they think and act. Two samples will show what these curious stories are like: (a) Jesus and Peter, journeyed from Namur: the disciple was sent forward to get food. He secured a fowl dressed with onions and started with it to meet his lord. Greed got the better of him and he devoured one leg of the fowl before they met: the lord demanded an explanation. Then St. Peter, to whom "lying was a pastime," boldly declared that one-leggedness was a peculiarity of fowls of that region. Presently they passed fowls roosting with one leg drawn up, and Peter called attention to them as confirmation of what he had said. Jesus thereupon, by outcry and gestures, frightened the fowls, so that they at once set down their second legs and fled in terror. "Liar! you see the creatures are not as you stated!" " Zounds! Master! you had but to do the same to the first fowl! Perhaps its second leg had appeared also." In</page><page sequence="9">COMIPARA TIVE-RELIGION N.,OTES. 53 this story Peter is irrepressible, but usually he is reduced. (b) Thus, one day as they journeyed they were approaching a desert. Jesus, seeing an old horseshoe, suggested that Peter should pick it up. It was not however worth his while, so the master himself took it. At the next village he sold it to a blacksmith and, with the few sous, bought cherries. As they journeyed then on into the desert, the heat became intense. Peter grumbled. "Happy is he," said the Lord, "who can refresh himself," and he ate a cherry. The suffering disciple was too proud to ask for a share. The master, pitying him, dropped as if by accident one of the smallest cherries; the saint, quickly stooping, picked it up and ate it. The same thing happened repeatedly. When all were gone, the Lord turning said-" See! in less than an hour you have stooped twenty times, Peter,-but I bent only once to pick up the horseshoe you despised. Remember that everything has a value and let this serve you as a lesson." And St. Peter, greatly ashamed, followed Jesus without a word.</page></plain_text>
