<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Checklist for Evaluating Content- Based Hypertext Computer Software Denise Tolhurst Hypertext is a term used to describe the concept of non-linear text. The availability of electronic media that will facilitate the rapid branching from one page of text to another has made hypertext a reality. A student reading new material can select a word that s/he does not understand (or wishes to know more about) and branch to another screen of text that gives more information about that unknown word. A reader is given control to move from screen to screen using a pre-determined set of links. These links are identified by a highlighted set of 'key words' that the reader will recognize as being linked to more information. The high- lighting may be indicated by words that are bolded, underlined or italicized. Hypertext is not a new concept, but one for which there is now a growing number of additional software packages in the educational arena. With the availability of yet another type of software for teachers to use in the classroom, there is also an accompanying collection of educational issues that must be considered with its introduction to students. Teachers must evaluate the effectiveness of yet another software category, with its own set of related features and implementation issues. This article provides a discussion of the issues surrounding the evaluation of hypertext software and a checklist to assist teachers in evaluating content-based hypertext software for computers. Hypertext applications in the educational arena can include electronic encyclopedias that provide quick searching and concept-linking; electronic story books that include speech and dynamic Denise Tolhurst is Lecturer in Computing, University of New South Wales, St. George Campus, Oatley, NSW, Australia. linking; tutorials with links to the explanations of terms and definitions; tutorials with links to glossaries; and applications with bibliographic information. Hypertext packages available on the market generally come in one of two forms. One type pro- vides material on particular curriculum areas con- structed using hypertext principles. These hyper- text applications are largely content-based. The other type provides an authoring environment for educators to create classroom applications of a hypertext nature. These authoring environments include utilities that facilitate the creation of the links between key words identified by the hyper- text application developer. This article focuses on the former, the content-based hypertext applica- tion. When evaluating any educational package, there are some general principles that apply to all categories of software. This article highlights aspects that need to be considered for the specialized area of hypertext software, then pro- vides a checklist that addresses both general software evaluation criteria and the specialized hypertext evaluation criteria. Aspects considered include implementation details, documentation and packaging, the user interface, classroom management, and curriculum issues. Implementation Considerations Implementations of hypertext applications often require a large amount of storage for textual and graphical information. This can sometimes require that CD-ROM or laser disc technology be used to store the large amounts of data- or at least a computer system with a hard disk. Hypertext applications can also include multimedia aspects which enhance presentations with graphics, anima- tion, sound effects, music, etc. This too can necessitate the inclusion of CD-ROM and laser disc peripherals. If these mass storage media are not required, it is important to establish that it will not be necessary to take part in excessive disk swapping, which can be extremely tedious. Documentation and Packaging Documentation in a hypertext package could productively include identification of the links that exist between data. Sometimes there are primary and secondary links of differing importance. Identification of the links could take the form of written descriptions or of diagrammatic maps that illustrate the links. The links in a hypertext application can be based on a number of different branching tech- niques. The branches can be binary, hierarchical, or of a network configuration. Identification or EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/March 1992 17</page><page sequence="2">description of the branching method(s) will assist in developing an effective working model of the software. Branching can be included that has a "chance" factor built-in, based on probability. This type of branching is appropriate for fiction-based applica- tions, where stories can be made more interesting by removing a degree of predictability. Documen- tation of the existence of this type of feature should be included where it is used. The User Interface 1 . User Control vs. Amount of Guidance One of the claims about hypertext applications is that the user is free to explore paths through the textual information that is of most personal interest. A user can be given absolute control to go wherever he/she wants in a hypertext applica- tion, but at the same time s/he can be given little or no guidance. One of the important skills of a teacher is to sequence learning experiences, linking new material to existing knowledge. If a hypertext application gives students absolute control over the sequence in which they view material, how does a teacher provide guidance? Some hypertext applications can enforce an amount of control by restricting choices, and hence provide some guidance. Some software will allow a teacher to use software settings to determine the amount of user control. When evaluating hypertext software, the educator must determine whether there is a balance between the amount of student control and guidance provided by the system. This is a demand- ing task to determine, but one which deserves considerable attention. It is a task that should become the subject of important research. 2. Navigation Aids for the Reader Linked to the idea of student control is the con- cept of providing navigation aids to the reader who is permitted control to move around a hypertext. If readers are given control to move at will, there is a possibility that they may loose track of where they are, where they have been, and where they are going within a hypertext document. It is likely that readers will wish to orientate themselves within a document by standing back from the content "pages" to see an overall plan of the possible paths for reading. The overall plan of the possible paths can take a number of forms (dis- cussed below), and all provide users with assistance in "navigating" their way through a document. The purposes for which readers may use naviga- tion aids include: planning a reading path before starting, tracing a path that has already been read with a view to determining if they are heading in the desired direction, determining progress so far and planning where to go next, finding where they deviated from the desired reading direction, and getting back on track. Navigation aids can take a number of forms, one of which is a map that illustrates the links that exist between screens of information. These maps can be very useful when they are not overly complex, but if there are a lot of links, they can be nothing short of a mass of confusing lines "going everywhere." If maps showing links are a provided navigation aid in a software package, the evaluator must decide if they are really useful. Another form that a navigation aid can take is of a graphic environmental map based on a concept with which the reader should be familiar. For example, when studying the topic of digestion, a graphic representation can be provided that shows the items of interest within a diagram of the body. Users can trace their way through the study of digestion by choosing sections of the diagram that link to related textual information which in turn has additional hypertext links. The readers can follow hypertext links, and if they become lost, go back to the diagram to reorientate themselves. Alternatively, readers may choose to follow the links by regularly going back to the diagram. Graphic environmental maps can include environ- ments such as historical settings, geographical features, archaeological sites, building plans, court rooms, playgrounds, etc. When evaluating this type of navigation aid, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness for the intended reader of the model on which the graphic environmental map is based. A "friendly guide" can also assist a disoriented reader. When a reader becomes lost, the choice of an ever-present icon that represents a friendly guide can provide suggestions of possible paths to follow from the present screen. This idea can be particularly useful to a young or inexperienced hypertext reader. It is possible to present a number of possible guides that provide different points of view of where to read next. For example, when reading material on environmental issues, there could be guides that represent different interest groups which will suggest different paths. The reader can get advice from one guide or a number of guides before choosing a path. Where a multimedia aspect is included in the hypertext environment, a graphic that uses icons can be based on a familiar model to provide assistance. For example, icons based on a video controller can provide a navigation aid for playing, rewinding, fast-forwarding, etc., through film seg- ments from a laser disc. An evaluator of hypertext software must pay considerable attention to the navigation aids that 18 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/March 1992</page><page sequence="3">are provided for the reader. The appropriateness of the type of navigation aid for the level of reader, the amount of assistance it provides, and the avail- ability of the aid when needed are important aspects. Whatever the form of navigation aid, it is essential that the map indicates "where the reader is now." It would also be desirable that the map show the path the reader has followed so far. 3. Clearly Indicated Linking Mechanisms The basis for hypertext applications is the linking of information using key words. The key words on which linking is available can be indicated by clearly marking words with a particular type style. Words can be bolded, underlined or italicized, for example. An evaluator of hypertext applications should determine whether the key words are clearly distinguishable. The method of highlighting words should also be appropriate to the intended reader. In addition to "key word" linking in an hyper- text application, it is necessary for some system links to be established. These system links may be in the form of links to the navigation aids de- scribed in the previous section, or links allowing exits from any point. An evaluator should deter- mine whether the system links and the key word links are clearly distinguishable, and if in fact it is necessary to distinguish between types of links. 4. Hypertext Contexts Within a hypertext application there may exist a number of contexts in which reading can take place. There may be the presentation of some new material on a topic, with the opportunity to branch to a glossary to have some terminology or concepts explained. If readers can work within different contexts, it should be made obvious which context they are reading within. Headings for every available screen or obvious differences in screen design for differ- ent contexts are two ways to accomplish this. An evaluator should ensure that contexts are clearly distinguishable to all readers. Another aspect of context is that of "how far" you have worked through the material. When reading a book, students know roughly whether they have just started, are half-way through, or nearly finished. When reading material in an electronic environment, that context is not so obvious. When evaluating a hypertext application, a judgment should be made as to whether this aspect of context has been established. Classroom Management Considerations A facility that should be available in any hyper- text application to enhance classroom implemen- tation is the ability to save and retrace or print a path taken by the reader through the software. Limited class duration may necessitate the need for a student to refresh his/her memory of previous progress. A printout of the path followed may also provide opportunity for some valid off-computer activities. Another classroom practicality is that students may need to make personal notes in order to maximize internalization of the material presented. A facility that allows the student to record thoughts and notes is a valuable addition to a hypertext application. A student should be able to call up a "note page" whenever s/he wants to record an important point. A facility to print the notes is also highly desirable. Curriculum Considerations Because of the freedom given to the reader to choose different paths through the software, it is apparent that hypertext implementations will provide an environment for discovery learning or guided discovery. This feature is closely linked to the issue of student control vs. student guidance. An evaluator of a hypertext package must deter- mine whether the environment provided is one in which the reader experiences discovery learning or experiences guided discovery. A purely discovery experience is more likely to cause the reader to become lost, which makes the navigation aids even more important. A guided discovery environment is more likely to provide a balance between user freedom and user guidance. An evaluator must carefully consider the degree of guidance provided and its implications for learning, teaching style, and classroom management. The choice of appropriate terms or words for linking is another curriculum issue. Determining whether linked words are the ones that readers are most likely to choose for branching, and deter- mining the appropriateness of the words and terms for the curriculum being taught, will help in selecting software of relevance to students and the curriculum. Another consideration is whether information presented on each screen is presented in a logical "chunk." Typically less information can be presented on a screen than on a printed page. An evalutor must determine that information does not become fragmented, when divided for screen presentation. The use of multiple representations of concepts is a possibilty in hypertext applications. Multi- media devices make it possible to enhance textual explanations with the addition of diagrams, sound, music, film segments, graphics, and animation. Evaluation of these multiple representations should EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/March 1992 19</page><page sequence="4">consider the timeliness of the use of any other representation, the appropriateness of the medium of the alternative representation, the appropriate- ness of any model used in graphical or animated representation together with the previously mentioned aspects of bias elimination in film segments, images, etc. Conclusion This article has presented specific issues related to the evaluation of hypertext software which have been highlighted because of the unique features of this category of software. A checklist follows that summarizes the issues presented here and general software evaluation considerations. The intention of the checklist is to address issues related to hypertext content-based software, while ensuring that the general software evaluations are not overlooked. □ Evaluation Checklist for Content-Based Hypertext Computer Software Implementation Considerations General What type of computer is required to run the software?
