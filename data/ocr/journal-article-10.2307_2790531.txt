In this third part of the series bearing the above title our Fellow completes her account of the excavations of the megalithic temple at Borg en Nadur with the final plan of the ruins, illustra- tions of new finds .and a comparative analysis of the results, The three volumes thus constitute an indispensable mono- graph on Maltese antiquities. Miss Murray's site illustrates what may be taken as the ground plan of the Maltese megalithic temples, a pair of communi- cating double apses leading to a semi- circular "sanctuary" and opening on to a large court. It illustrates, moreover, three of the four main types of pillar found at other sites in which the author also suggests a typological evolution, the baluster form, not represented at Borg en Nadur, representing the latest variant. Unfortunately, the remains discovered here provide little or no fresh evidence for dating the whole mysterious complex; sherds of Zammit's "neolithic" and "bronze age" classes were alike found with no such stratigraphical separation as was observed at Hal Tarxien. Sir Arthur Evans has shown, in The Palace of Minos, vol. II, that close Middle Minoan parallels offer an upper limit for the former class. The specimens of "bronze age' pottery published here and in the second part have such obviously late affinities that his seemingly revolutionary proposal may be regarded as confirmed. Thus the askoi (called here duck-vases), pedes- talled bowls with a handle under the bowl, biconical mugs and amphorae, and high handles with a V-shaped depression or fan-like lateral expansion at the peak all recur in transitional deposits in Sicily and contemporary or in some cases rather later deposits in Italy. The same Sicilian vases may be decorated with groups of wide shallow incisions supplemented by dots such as constitute almost the sole decoration of the intrusive pottery in Malta. Some of these features, such as the dented and fan-splayed handles, certainly may have a longer history in the western Mediterranean, as has the oculi motive on some sherds from Tarxien whose affinities lie with the copper ago vases of Almeria and Denmark on the one hand and the anthropomorphic lids of Troy II on the other. A curious feature at Borg en Nadur is the number of anchor-shaped objects of clay to which only Bahria offers parallels on the island. They closely resemble a group of neolithic "ornaments" from Thessaly and Central Greece, save that they are perforated. Miss Murray believes that they were actually votive anchors dedicated by sailors, the two sites where they occur being suitable places for such offerings. She does not, however, adduce any independent evidence for the use of the anchor in the Mediterranean before 1000 B.C. Such evidence is possibly to be found in certain signs on the Knossian tablets to which Sir Arthur Evans has recently called attention. V. G. C. [ 147 ]</page></plain_text>
