<plain_text><page sequence="1">291 Small Community Organization During the Late Formative Period in Oaxaca, Mexico Michael E. Whalen University of Tulsa Tulsa, Oklahoma Late Formative (ca. 300-100 B.c.) cultural systems of highland Mesoamerica have been studied mostly at the regional level and at the tops of local settlement-system hierarchies. We know much less about the structure ofsmall communities. Data from a minor Oaxacan site are used to identify two aspects of this community's internal and external organization: 1) a status-graded set of household units headed by an elite family, itselfpart of a valley- wide ruling stratum, and 2) workshop-level ceramic production for supra-community consumption. Introduction The end of the Formative period in highland Meso- america (ca. 300 B.c to A.C. 200) saw the culmination of developmental processes begun a millennium earlier. Cul- tural systems were rapidly growing in size, population, level of centralization, and extent of hierarchical structure. It is generally agreed that full-fledged states emerged in key areas of Mesoamerica by Late Formative times, and there are a number of important studies of these devel- opments (e.g., Sanders, Parsons, and Santley 1979; Hirth 1980; Blanton et al. 1982; Spencer 1982; Kowalewski et al. 1983). Nevertheless, much remains to be learned about Late Formative cultures. Most data come from settlement pattern surveys in Morelos and the Valleys of Mexico and Oaxaca. Although these projects have produced major data sets of exemplary quality, they only represent the beginning of the investigative process. There are no ex- cavation data that approach the scope of these regional surveys, and what little data there are come mostly from large sites such as Monte Albin, Monte Negro, Huame- lulpan, Yucuita, and Teotihuacin. Late Formative cultural systems have been studied largely at the regional level and at the tops of local settlement-system hierarchies. A notable deficiency in our understanding of Late For- mative cultures of highland Mesoamerica is the lack of fine-scale excavation data from the small and medium- sized communities that accommodated sizable fractions of expanding local populations. As a result, almost nothing of the internal structures and organization of important settlement system components is understood. Lack of these data, in turn, impedes synthesis of an adequate pic- ture of the structure and operation of Late Formative societies. This deficiency stimulates the present paper, which ex- amines and interprets data on small-community structure and composition at the end of the Formative in the Valley of Oaxaca. The data used here were presented elsewhere in preliminary fashion (Whalen 1981). The focus of that study was the Early Formative, however, and the Late Formative data were not analyzed in much detail. In ad- dition, other researchers have recently accumulated and interpreted large bodies of new data on the regional po- litical and economic structures of the Late Formative Val- ley of Oaxaca. The present study will consider how its data fit these new models. Throughout this study, the Middle-to-Late Formative transition period is designated the Monte Albin Early I period, ca. 500 B.c. to 300 B.C. The Late Formative is the Monte Alban Late I period, ca. 300 B.C. to 100 B.C., and the Terminal Formative is Monte Albn II, ca. 100 B.C. to A.C. 200. This terminology reflects the primacy of the hilltop center of Monte Albin (FIG. i), around which valley-wide political and economic power began to center in the Early I period. For many succeeding centuries, political, economic, and social developments all over the valley were strongly influenced by the powerful Monte Albin system. Any community analysis must, therefore, be structured around this reality. The Physical and Cultural Setting The Valley of Oaxaca lies in the southern highlands of Mexico (FIG. 1). Parts of the Y-shaped valley floor contain</page><page sequence="2">292 Community Organization in Oaxaca, Mexico/Whalen Etla branch map area Fabrica San Jose Tierras Largas - Yagul Monte Alban ,0Tomaltepec Abasolo Tiacolula branch valley floor Valle Grande 0 15 km Figure 1. Mesoamerica and the Valley of Oaxaca, showing sites and areas mentioned in the text. a permanent river with broad flood plains. Flanking pied- mont zones rise to high surrounding mountains. Good physical descriptions of the valley have been published elsewhere (e.g., Flannery et al. 1967). The site of Santo Domingo Tomaltepec lies in the piedmont zone of the eastern arm of the valley, located ca. 17 km from Monte Albin. The following view of regional development and dem- ography is summarized from the recent work of the Valley of Oaxaca Settlement Pattern Project (Blanton et al. 1982: 45-71). Valley populations expanded greatly in the Early I period, and part of this growing population was accom- modated in the valley piedmont. Villages existed here in the past, but major population expansion dates from Early I times. Most of this growth took place within 20 km of Monte Albain, and it is suggested that the center was partially sustained by canal-irrigated piedmont agricultural produce. It is further argued that there were great political and economic changes at this time. Valley settlement sys- tems were reorganized into a three-level, Monte Albain- centered administrative hierarchy, and a regional market system is inferred to have existed under the control of this structure. The Late I period continues growth within the Early I pattern, although the system became still more complex. A four- or five-tiered settlement hierarchy is evident, con- sisting of a single major center (Monte Albin), district centers of several sizes, minor centers, and hamlets. Sites were classified by estimates of sizes of populations and public buildings. Hamlets had no public buildings. De- spite this hierarchical elaboration, however, the valley still remained strongly centered on Monte Alban, which was the focus of political and economic activity within the settlement system. It is clear that the agricultural potential of the valley was being widely exploited by Late I times, supporting considerable populations. There were an esti- mated 30,000 people in the central and southern portions of the valley alone, and population subsequently increased above this level. Considerable social change must have been part of this growth and restructuring. The elaboration of social dif- ferentiation is reflected in the few excavations of Late I period tombs and burials in and around the valley (e.g., Chadwick 1966; Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967; Winter 1972; Whalen 1981). The elaboration of these burial fa- cilities, plus the relative simplicity of most of their con- temporaries, indicates a highly-differentiated social sys- tem. Going farther, Flannery and his co-authors assert that the Monte Albin I period saw the emergence of a "class- endogamous professional ruling stratum of valley-wide significance" (Flannery, Marcus, and Kowalewski 1981: 92). The Tomaltepec community was a minor participant in these larger developments. Its small ceremonial-civic zone and modest population would place it near the bottom of the administrative hierarchy postulated for Late I. The significance of the Tomaltepec community does not lie in its prominence, but in the specific view that it provides of the details of Late I community structure. What happened at the regional level in the Valley of Oaxaca is being clarified by others. We now turn to consideration of how this change was effected at the community level. Community Structure By the Late I period, the Tomaltepec community had expanded to its maximum size of ca. 4.5 ha. This is a considerable increase over the Early I figure of ca. 1 ha. There may have been about six Early I households, in- creasing to about 20 by Late I times. The population of Late I Tomaltepec would have been on the order of 100 people. Succeeding discussion will consider this commu- nity's structure in terms of 1) the nature of its ceremonial- civic and residential zones; 2) mortuary practices; and 3) the spatial arrangement of community components. Fig- ure 2 shows the community components discussed here.</page><page sequence="3">Journal ofField Archaeology/Vol. 15, 1988 293 NO Ic-4 4 3 Ic-3 0 100 mound m O household unit contour interval is Im. Figure 2. Late I community components investigated at Tornaltepec. More Late I deposits are expected to the north, west, and sw of the mound area. The Ceremonial-Civic Zone Although central public building locations are charac- teristic of Mesoamerican communities, the Tomaltepec Late I village focused on a structure on its SE edge. The building was positioned over a series of older structures dating back to the Early Formative. This zone has been described and illustrated elsewhere (Whalen 1981), so that only a brief summary appears here. The Late I ceremonial- civic zone consisted of a large platform (Mound 1) plus three smaller platforms (Mounds 2-4). Mound 1 is ca. 5 m high, covering ca. 150 sq m. Mounds 2, 3, and 4 stand 1 m to 2 m high, each covering ca. 75 sq m. Trenches, road cuts, and looters' holes in all four mounds show substantial Late I enlargement of Mound 1. Mounds 2, 3, and 4 were also constructed at the same time. Atop Mound 1 was a series of at least three plaster floors constructed throughout the Monte Albhin Late I and Early II periods. Project resources did not permit extensive study of these constructions, although a brief investigation was carried out on the upper floor (Sallade 1981). The author concluded that this structure was a minor example of the two-roomed temple common in Oaxaca from the end of the Formative through the early Classic. No excavation was done on the Late I floors beneath this temple. Nevertheless, similarity in dimensions suggest that the Late I buildings functioned in the same way as the temple that succeeded them. The centers of all four mounds lie along a roughly E-w axis. Two mounds (1 and 4) are known to have contained human burials. Finally, vestiges of plaster around the mounds and in the road cuts passing between them sug- gest that all four platforms were connected by plastered surfaces. The platforms thus appear to form a contempo- rary, well-defined unit, which was likely the scene of cer- emonial-civic activities. The Residential Zone HOUSEHOLD UNIT DEFINITION Household unit Ic-1 is a cluster of two elaborate resi- dences (Structures 9 and 10) lying a short distance north of Mound 1. Here, at least two small platforms enclosed a patio (FIG. 3). Only the northernmost platform (Struc- ture 9) was completely exposed. Walls and steps were built of cut stone, rubble was used for fill, and a plaster floor topped the structure. It measured ca. 4 m x 5 m, and it was about 0.6 m high. Its plaster floor was very badly damaged, and no trace remained of the house that it presumably supported. Built into the center of the plat- form was a small tomb with an earthen floor, adobe brick walls, and a cover of thin stone slabs (FIG. 3). The tomb measured ca. 2 m long x 0.8 m wide x 0.4 m deep. A corner of the second platform (Structure 10) was also exposed. It, too, had cut stone walls, a plastered floor, and dimensions similar to Structure 9. It is not known if a tomb was present in Structure 10. Houses presumably stood atop the two small platforms. The construction of the Ic-1 houses probably included both adobe brick and wattle-and-daub. Several kg of adobe brick chunks and stick-impressed daub fragments came from the debris around the platforms. From the size of the exposed platform, it is estimated that each of the houses had on the order of 16-18 sq m of floor space. Associated features and artifacts indicate that the plat- forms were residential. Several heavily-burned pit features were scattered between the two platforms. To the north, across the modern road cut, lay a large trash midden and several additional pits. These northern pits were filled with domestic debris, although none evidenced heavy burning. In addition to these features, the entire northern portion</page><page sequence="4">294 Community Organization in Oaxaca, Mexico/Whalen -excavated area N IN heavy late I debris road tomb excavated area structure 9 -adobe-walled pit 0 5 0 structure 10 m c stone unburned feature burned feature '3 midden Figure 3.

It is noteworthy that the north- ern part of Ic-1 has features of a different sort than the southern part. In the south, these pits have heavily burned edges. The northern features are not burned, and domestic trash is much more common. These differences may reflect different activity zones in household unit Ic-1. These are the following: 1) a residential zone, including the plat- forms and their courtyard; 2) a heavily-used activity zone to one side of, but near, the residential zone; and 3) a peripheral dumping zone with unburned features or bor- row pits and a considerable amount of domestic refuse. It is unfortunate that the modern road cut has obliterated the transitional area between the postulated residential and dumping zones. These components of household unit Ic- 1 occur over a distance of some 20 m. This is not unusually large for Middle or Late Formative household units in Oaxaca. Winter (1972: 111) describes Monte Albin Early I household units of ca. 20 m in diameter at the nearby site of Tierras Largas. A clearly defined Monte Albin II household unit at Tomaltepec was also at least 20 m in diameter (Whalen 1981: 109). A second Late I area was partially excavated and des- ignated Ic-3. It is defined by domestic refuse, chunks of adobe and stick-impressed daub, human burials, and a large set of fire pits. The depth of deposit here is insuffi- cient to cover platforms like those of unit Ic-1. It is there- fore reasonable to assert that houses at Ic-3 did not sit on platforms. No house floor was recovered in the Ic-3 ex- cavations, which are shown in Figure 4. Contemporary deposits were thin to the north, east, and south, increasing to the sw and west. It is here that the postulated Ic-3 house was most likely situated. Comparison of Figures 3 and 4 shows that the Ic-3 area is much like the SE section of Ic-1. Found in both cases were large, closely-spaced fire pits of two sorts. Some were shallow basins ranging from 30 cm to 50 cm in diameter and presumably serving as hearths. The second sort of firepit was a larger, deeper basin of oval or round shape. The edges of all these deep pits were brick-red from in- tensive heating, and several of the oval pits were sub- divided by adobe brick walls extending from floor to rim. None of the pits contained accumulations of ash or char- coal, indicating periodic cleaning. These pits may have been used for pottery firing, a question to be considered in more detail presently. The last Monte Alban Late I area excavated at Tomal- tepec was designated Ic-4. Discovered here were pottery, domestic trash, several human burials, and a small quantity of stick-impressed daub. No Late I features or floors were found here. Depth of deposit in this area was insufficient to conceal platforms like those found in household unit Ic-1. Any house around the Ic-4 area must, therefore, have been constructed without a platform. The Ic-4 area is difficult to interpret because material is so sparse. It could be an isolated dumping area on the periphery of the com- munity, or, alternatively, it could be a portion of a house- hold unit. The question may be resolved by comparing data from units Ic-1, Ic-3, and Ic-4. All three areas yielded human burials, domestic refuse, and small-to-moderate quantities of stick-impressed daub. The Ic-1 area is clearly a house- hold unit. It was at least 20 m in diameter, and it may have been subdivided into a residential zone, an activity zone, and a peripheral dumping zone. If this model holds true for other Tomaltepec household units, then the finds in areas Ic-3 and 4 can be interpreted, respectively, as portions of the activity zone and the peripheral dumping</page><page sequence="5">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 15, 1988 295 zone of two incompletely-exposed household units. The alternative explanation, that the two areas are non-resi- dential activity loci, seems less feasible in light of the human burials, domestic trash, and house-construction debris. It is noteworthy that both the Ic-3 and Ic-4 areas are of appropriate size to be household unit components. Both would easily fit in the Ic-1 household unit. Accord- ingly, all three areas are analyzed as household units in succeeding pages. It is more difficult to decide what kinds of household units these were. It has been argued elsewhere (Whalen 1988) that the preceding Middle Formative period throughout highland Mesoamerica saw increases in resi- dential unit size, coupled with the appearance of clusters of two or more houses. These structures were either con- nected or located in very close proximity. Data from Oax- aca (Drennan 1976; Whalen 1981), from TehuacTin (Spencer 1982), and from central Mexico (Sanders, Par- sons, and Santley 1979) were cited in support of this proposition. That this trend continues through the Late Formative is indicated by the Tomaltepec data just cited, by Winter's (1974: 982) Monte Alban excavations, and by Santley's findings at Loma Torremote in central Mexico (Sanders, Parsons, and Santley 1979: 305-334). All show that connected or clustered houses were present in Late Formative times, presumably accommodating some type of extended residential unit. It is unnecessary to argue that all Late Formative households were of an extended type, although some appear to have been present at Tomaltepec, Monte Albin, and elsewhere in highland Mexico. HOUSEHOLD-ASSOCIATED ARTIFACTS The domestic trash found in household units Ic-1 and Ic-3 includes ceramics, chipped and ground stone, animal bones, carbonized remains of wild and cultivated plants, clay figurines, and fragments of ornaments of shell and mica. These data are tabulated in the original site report (Whalen 1981: 90). The artifacts of possible household unit Ic-4 are more difficult to describe, as the domestic refuse there was mixed with that of a preceding Early I household unit in the same area. It was impossible to separate the non-diagnostic trash of the two periods. This discussion therefore considers only Ic-1 and Ic-3 artifacts. Refuse is similar in both cases, suggesting comparable ranges of domestic activities. Household unit Ic-1 yielded corn, avocado pits, and chenopod/amaranth seeds, while comparable quantities of corn and cheno-ams came from Ic-3. Other food remains from Late I households include bones of deer, dog, peccary, and rabbit. Deer bones out- number all other species by about five to one in household unit Ic-1. Less area was excavated in Ic-3, and total bone 1 excavated area - fire-reddened earth (@ adobe bricks r---o burial O deep feature shallow feature Figure 4. The Area Ic-3 excavations. Abundant Late I refuse was found around the pits. Deeper deposits to the west and sw may cover a house. counts are proportionately smaller. Nevertheless, the ratio of deer bone to all other bone in Ic-3 was only one to one. Bearing in mind the small size of the excavated sam- ple, it can still be suggested that the inhabitants of Ic-1 consumed more deer and less of other species (e.g., dog and rabbit) than did their neighbors. Chipped stone debitage from both households includes chert, obsidian, and a local silicified siltstone. Absolute quantities of chipped stone differ greatly between the two household units, with 53 pieces from Ic-1, versus only nine pieces from Ic-3. This may be explained by noting that 90% of the Ic-1 total came from the postulated dump- ing zone at the northern edge of the unit. In contrast, an apparently specialized activity zone was dug in Ic-3, yield- ing very little chipped stone. There is a similar disparity in quantities of ground stone from household units Ic-1 and Ic-3 (11 pieces versus 7). In sum, comparison of domestic trash from units Ic-1 and Ic-3 reveals some similarities and differences. It must be recalled, however, that a residential zone, an activity</page><page sequence="6">296 Community Organization in Oaxaca, Mexico/Whalen ;.i. ?? ii -: :L ~ii :i Ci i;.--- r --- I:? / I ?'' ~i~ : I r-; ?r: I \v r;U, ;jK\.;?t~ II ~JF;;I?;~~ L ?:'~i~:'c;lfi?~?*%:~~e!I: ~~? i- 1 .I r ~:i??? ... ??i~ ;~c"`''~ :,? .?:~-~~~~ '~E;t~ a. ~p~ ;Y ?

All other tomb vessels were whole. zone, and a dumping zone were excavated in Ic-1, while only an activity zone was explored in Ic-3. It would, therefore, be surprising if assemblages from the two households were identical. Artifact distribution patterns may be explained under the hypothesis that different, spe- cialized portions of several household units were exca- vated. MORTUARY PRACTICES Late I deposits at Tomaltepec yielded seven single and multiple burials, containing the remains of six adults and three children. All but one adult burial were primary in- terments. Also present were two badly-disturbed adult burials in Mounds 1 and 4. No other mortuary data are available for these two interments, and they are not con- sidered further in this analysis. Other Tomaltepec Late I burials included two adults and two children from house- hold unit Ic-1, two adults and one child from Ic-3, and two adults from Ic-4. Male and female adults were present in these household unit burials. Despite the few mound burials, it appears that most villagers were buried in their residential groups. This continues the Middle Formative practice noted here and elsewhere in the Valley of Oaxaca</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 15, 1988 297 ?:wr~ I ~-~? ~.~~%l~-~Tt?.*Y~~?:31? ;~ .CI ~I-??.?-; r ;~ ~; ????~??? r:.,i~U~-?r :~?

Adult burials throughout the valley were oriented E-W, with the head usually to the west. Most burials were supine, with extended arms and legs. The majority of child burials also followed this pattern. Other aspects of mortuary treatment varied considerably among Tomaltepec households. Mor- tuary practices are briefly discussed for each household unit. Age and sex identifications were made by Dr. Rich- ard G. Wilkinson, Oaxaca Project osteologist. The tomb associated with Ic-1 has already been de- scribed. It contained the badly-disturbed and deteriorated remains of a female aged 30 to 40 years, an adult of undetermined sex of 30 to 50 years, and a child of about 12 years who was tentatively identified as a male. The tomb had apparently been opened in antiquity, looted, and roughly reclosed. The stone covering-slabs were loosely replaced, and 26 vessels were dumped in a pile atop them. Inside the tomb were nine more whole vessels, as well as fragments of some of the vessels found on the covering slabs. It is presumed that all 35 vessels were originally placed inside the tomb. One greenstone bead was found in a vessel inside the tomb. The tomb's ceramic offering included bowls, spouted and unspouted jars, and effigy vessels (FIG. s). One incom-</page><page sequence="8">298 Community Organization in Oaxaca, Mexico/Whalen plete but impressive vessel was represented by a large tiger mask and a hollow, paw-shaped handle (FIG. 5A). A whistle within the paw would have sounded as liquid was poured from the jar. The paste was quite distinctive, showing that the two parts came from the same vessel. All other vessels were whole, including the elaborate specimen shown in Figure 5b. This figure's headdress carries a device that may be "Glyph C," long recognized as a common element in Zapotec art (e.g., Caso 1928). Leigh (1966), studying the evolution of the motif from ca. 300 B.C. to A.C. 800, argues that its earliest and simplest form is a cross-sec- tioned basin from which water flows. This is very much like the Tomaltepec figure. The same author also notes that the glyph occurs with bar-and-dot numerals, becom- ing the day-sign "Water." The Zapotec are known to have used a ritual calendar of 20 day signs plus 13 numbers, which cycled through 260 days (Marcus 1983: 91-92). Within this system, the Tomaltepec figure's headdress glyph could be read "2-Water." This may also be a cal- endric name. In his discussion of Monte Albsan hiero- glyphic writing, Caso (1965: 940) notes that portions of the names of individuals were expressed as a day-sign, probably that of their birthday (e.g., "1-Deer"). The second burial in household unit Ic-1 was that of a child of ca. five years. Three ordinary vessels accompanied the burial, which lay in a pit grave immediately behind (north of) the platform that contained the tomb. It would have been situated on the edge of the household unit's postulated residential zone. It is unclear why some Ic-i residents had a tomb, while others did not. The two burials may not be precisely contemporary. The burial situation is quite different in household unit Ic-3. Here, the remains of three adults were found in pit graves around, but not in, the postulated ceramic firing ovens. All of these adults were identified as male, with ages of 35+, 40, and 40+. Two were primary burials, and one was a secondary interment accompanying one of the former. A child of less than six years was also found buried without offerings in the fill of one of the firing pits. The Ic-3 adults had a few offerings. One primary burial had a pair of unmatched marine shells (cf. Mega- pitaria aurantiaca) and a fragment of an unidentified ma- rine gastropod. The other primary burial had two bowls, a plain spouted jar, and a cup made from the right parietal of a human skull, and was accompanied by a secondary burial. The skull of the secondary burial lay on the chest of the primary individual, while the former's limb bones were piled around the feet of the other. The skull cup did not come from the cranium of the secondary burial. The Ic-3 burials are taken to reflect a lower order of magnitude of funerary elaboration than their Ic-1 contem- poraries, whether grave type or mortuary offerings are considered. It may also be significant that the Ic-3 child was without offerings, while both the Ic-1 children were more elaborately treated. One was included in the tomb, and the other had as many ceramic offerings (three) as the most elaborate Ic-3 adult burial. The Ic-4 burials included a woman of ca. 40 years and an adult of undetermined age and sex. Their mortuary treatment was even simpler than those of Ic-3: both lay in simple pit graves without any offerings. In sum, the Tomaltepec Late I burials suggest that children and adults of both sexes were buried anywhere in the postulated residential, activity, and dumping zones of their household units. At least two burials were put into the mounds, but it is argued that interment in resi- dential units was the main method of disposal of the dead at Late I Tomaltepec. Burial position was fairly standard- ized, although there were considerable differences in level of elaboration of mortuary activity. SPATIAL AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION The assumption of this discussion is that the roles, statuses, and distinctions of a society's social organization are at least partially reflected in the spatial arrangement of its components (Clarke 1977). Societies with few social distinctions might, therefore, be expected to make rela- tively few spatial distinctions in the positioning of com- munity components. The Tomaltepec Early Formative community was characterized as simple in both social and spatial terms (Whalen 1983), while the Middle Formative community showed both increased social and spatial com- plexity (Whalen 1988). The Late Formative (Late I) set- tlement continued and intensified this trend. Two major community components can be defined: 1) the mound area, which presumably served as the community's cere- monial-civic core, and 2) residential units representing a wide range of social statuses. Late I households were distributed at variable distances around the ceremonial-civic area. It seems that household units increased in status with proximity to the mound area. This suggestion is based upon elaboration of archi- tecture and mortuary activity, both of which decrease with increasing distance from the mounds. This is expressed by projecting a line through the ceremonial-civic area. The mounds are arranged along a roughly E-w axis (ca. 102- 2820), and the projected line follows this. The perpendic- ular (i.e., least) distance of each household was then mea- sured from this axis. This is undoubtedly not a perfectly accurate way to characterize household-mound area spac-</page><page sequence="9">Journal ofField Archaeology/Vol. 15, 1988 299 100- 90 80 60-80m -1 In 70 E 60 E 50 E 50 -35-45m no house platforms S 40 pit graves 1 40 no grave goods ? 30 no house platforms 2pit graves 20 17m few grave goods 10- house platforms tomb many grave goods 0C1 Ic- 1 c-3 Ic-4 Household unit Figure 6.

Figure 6 summarizes spatial, architectural, and mortuary data. The Ic-1 measurement is from the axis to the house platforms. The Ic-3 measurement is not to a house, but to the firepits defining the unit. Extensive testing around the Ic-3 unit showed that contemporary deposits are thin to the north, east, and south. Late I deposits increased in density to the sw of the firepit area, suggesting that an associated house was located there. As already noted, the presence of a house was indicated by the stick-impressed daub fragments, the domestic refuse, and the human bur- ials found in the excavated portions of Ic-3. The point to be made here is that the Ic-3 distance shown in Figure 6 is the minimum spacing separating Ic-3 from the mound area. If the house was located just to the sw of the firepit area, as argued, its distance to the mound area axis would be ca. 40-45 m. The Ic-4 measurement is more proble- matical, as only burials were recovered. The burials were located ca. 80 m from the ceremonial-civic axis. Domestic debris suggests a house somewhere in the vicinity. If the burials were on the north edge of a household unit, they could be some 20 m from the house. The Ic-1 unit serves as a basis for this supposition. The minimum house-to- axis distance for Ic-4 is thus on the order of 60 m. Even though precise figures are not available, it is clear that the Ic-4 distance is considerably greater than those of Ic-1 and Ic-3. These data support the proposition that the Late I households held a range of status positions that declined with increasing distance from the ceremonial-civic core of the community. It will be recalled that, with the exception of deer con- sumption, excavation data did not reflect great differences in type or quality of domestic activities between household units Ic-1 and Ic-3. Nevertheless, the spatial, architectural, and mortuary data all imply status differentiation between the two. It may simply be that domestic activity patterns did not differ greatly between households in a small, rural community like Tomaltepec, even though some differ- ences in wealth or status did exist. In summary, the Late I period is the apogee of com- munity development at Tomaltepec. The settlement's total area increased more than four-fold over the preceding Middle Formative period, including great expansion of both the ceremonial-civic and residential sectors. In the ceremonial-civic area, a single modest-sized Early I plat- form was covered and replaced by a set of four aligned platforms of various shapes and sizes. These appear to have been connected by plastered surfaces, creating a formally-defined ceremonial civic sector that was markedly different from the residential portion of the community. The distinction between public and domestic zones was not so evident in earlier periods. This statement rests on the assumption that structures and their spatial patterns</page><page sequence="10">300 Community Organization in Oaxaca, Mexico/Whalen are visible manifestations of the distinctions made in social systems (Clarke 1977). Similar growth and diversification are evident in the residential sector of the Late I community. Surface data indicate that it was much larger than any of its predeces- sors. It also seems that this expanded residential zone can be divided along status lines. While extant data do not permit us to draw concentric status zones around the ceremonial-civic core, it does seem that houses closer to the core were of higher status than more distant ones. All residential space, in a word, does not appear to have been equal. Finally, it was argued that space within household units was partitioned into residential, activity, and dump- ing areas. Mortuary data also reflect substantial differen- tiation among Tomaltepec villagers. These data correlate closely with spatial and architectural status indicators, sug- gesting considerable distance between the top and bottom of the community's social scale. Community Integration Having tentatively identified some of the components of the Tomaltepec Late I community, we now turn to the question of their integration on both internal and external levels. Recent demographic work in the Valley of Oaxaca has revealed a regional structure from which no commu- nity could have stood apart. Understanding of Late I community integration at Tomaltepec must, therefore, in- volve both internal organization and external relations. From the data cited in this paper, it is argued that Late I regional organization was based on exercise of large- scale political and economic authority in a highly-stratified society. The question here is how this was manifested at a minor Late I community. Two aspects of internal and external community integration can be postulated from the Tomaltepec Late I data. These are 1) an internally- graded set of household units, headed by an elite family, itself part of a valley-wide ruling stratum; and 2) special- ized craft production for supra-community consumption. A link between the two is also possible: craft production may have been administered or controlled by the local managerial elite. Each of these points is considered below and supported by comparison with data from other sites and areas. Elite Families The internal differentiation of Tomaltepec Late I units has already been considered. Now at issue is the question of a valley-wide stratum of elite families. The idea is com- patible with current understandings of social organization in later periods. Pedro Carrasco, in his review of prehis- panic social organization, notes that a characteristic of ancient Mexican society was "segmentation of both land and people under the authority of individual members of the ruling class" (1971: 360). Charles Gibson describes pre-conquest Aztec Tlatoque, or local hereditary lords, whose families discharged general administrative functions in their communities (1960: 173), and Ronald Spores notes a similar system in the Post-Classic Mixteca Alta, an area immediately north of the Valley of Oaxaca (1967: 9, 118). In and around the Valley of Oaxaca, the Post-Classic Zapotec are described by Flannery and Marcus (1976: 376) as "a highly stratified society with a profes- sional ruling class, at whose head was a Coquiato, or "Great Lord." They further note that the common people lived in scattered communities, each overseen by a Coqui, or nobleman, who was appointed by the Coquiato. These data suggest that Post-Classic elite families throughout high- land Mesoamerica formed networks for the transmission of authority from the top of society down to the com- munity level. The question now is whether elite families can be identified in the Formative archaeological record. Mortuary data from several areas and time periods suggest that they can. An evident family tomb was found in Monte Albin II (Terminal Formative) deposits at Faibrica San Jose, in the northern arm of the Valley of Oaxaca (Drennan 1976: 276-278). The small, rectangular tomb contained the apparently sequential interments of three male adults for whom dental and skeletal similarities suggest a family relationship. The tomb was elaborately furnished with 25 vessels, a large stone celt, and marine shell ornaments. Still earlier is the Late Formative site of San Sebastian Abasolo, lying on the valley floor less than 10 km from Tomaltepec. Test excavations here revealed a Late I com- ponent containing an elaborate multiple burial similar to that at nearby, and contemporary, Tomaltepec. The inter- ment, designated A-5, is described by Winter (1972: 253- 258). A pit grave was used instead of a tomb. In it, an adult male and female lay side by side, accompanied by 21 vessels. This offering included bowls, miniature vessels, effigy vessels, and bridge-spouted jars with molded and incised figures. The mouths of the two skeletons contained a total of 12 greenstone beads, 10 with the male and 2 with the female. A group of adjacent tombs, one of them containing two individuals, also comes from Late I deposits at Yagul, a larger center a few km east of Tomaltepec (Chadwick 1966: 245-255). The offerings described in this brief re- port are not as numerous or as elaborate, per occupant, as those from Abasolo or Tomaltepec. Tomb construction</page><page sequence="11">Journal ofField Archaeology/Vol. 15, 1988 301 effort, on the other hand, was much greater at Yagul than at either of those two sites. Finally, multiple-occupant Period I and II tombs were excavated at Monte Albhin half a century ago. Winter (1972: 259-260) reviewed these data, noting that the total number of individuals involved is unclear. One burial from the Monte Albn II period deserves special note. Burial XIV-10, described by Acosta (1949: 17-25) and later by Winter (1972: 259-60), contained the remains of five individuals, plus a rich offering of ceramics, shell, pearls, and jade. There are no age and sex data, although the excavator suggested that two sets of skeletons repre- sent male-female pairs (Acosta 1949: 22). In summary, elaborate multiple burials come from a number of Oaxacan sites at the end of the Formative. These burials occur at a range of centers from Monte Alban down to Tomaltepec. As a group, their mortuary treatment and burial partners set them apart from the common, single interment. In one case, the familial rela- tionship of a tomb's inhabitants was indicated by dental and skeletal data. It therefore seems reasonable to suggest that other Late I individuals in multiple burials were re- lated by blood or marriage. It is also noteworthy that the same style of Late I tomb was being used all over the Valley of Oaxaca, from Monte Albin to Tomaltepec (Mar- quina 1951: 337; Covarrubias 1957: 154). Iconography provides another line of approach to the question of elite family lines. A decade ago, Flannery and Marcus (1976: 382) argued for a pattern of deification of royal ancestors at the end of the Oaxacan Formative and, especially, in the Classic period. This was based on the anthropomorphic funerary urns and beakers found in the elaborate tombs at Monte Albin and elsewhere in the area. The persons depicted on these vessels bear calendric names like "1-Tiger," a pattern commonly seen in Classic and Post-Classic Mesoamerican iconography. It is noteworthy that the Late I group tomb in the elite residence at To- maltepec contained three anthropomorphic vessels, one of which may have borne the inscription "2-Water." No other vessels with human representations or with name- dates were found anywhere else on the site. The Tomaltepec elite, then, seem to have been partici- pating in a pattern of mortuary ritual that 1) was distin- guished from the common burial by tombs, multiple in- terments, and elaborate grave furnishings; 2) was present at contemporary centers of a range of sizes; 3) was more elaborate at larger centers and simpler at smaller ones; and 4) involved only a small fraction of the valley's population. Finally, it is interesting to note that these postulated elite family burials were not common in the Valley of Oaxaca in the preceding Early I period. It may be that a system of organization based on elite families developed in Early I, but only spread into smaller valley communities by Late I. This idea is consistent with models of area development. Several authors have characterized the Monte Albn I period as a time of consolidation of a regional polity under the authority of the center at Monte Alban (e.g., Spencer 1982; Blanton et al. 1982). Requisite to these growth models is an increase in the elite population of the valley. Descent connections (whether real or fictive) among this expanding elite would provide a strong, coherent structure through which to administer local communities and the region. Literature has already been cited to show that regional administration by elite families characterized wide areas of Post-Classic Mesoamerica. The Oaxacan Late and Terminal Formative data may reveal the origins of a long- standing organizational pattern. The Tomaltepec data sug- gest that even small centers were tied into this network by Late I. Specialized Production A second aspect of the Tomaltepec community's internal and external integration may have been specialized pro- duction. It has been argued that the scale of ceramic pro- duction in the Valley of Oaxaca rose during Monte Alban I times due to increases in population, intensification of agricultural production, and political consolidation (Fein- man, Kowalewski, and Blanton 1984: 300). It is also ar- gued that a regional market system was developed in Monte Alban I times. This market system and its concom- itant specialized production are suggested to have arisen in Early I, developing to a considerable extent by Late I (e.g., Feinman, Blanton, and Kowalewski 1984: 157). It is in Late I times that we see evidences of specialized production at Tomaltepec. Stark (1985: 159) reviews the problem of identification of prehistoric ceramic production in Mesoamerica. Poten- tial lines of evidence include presence of raw materials, portable and permanent tools and facilities of production, by-products of production such as sherds damaged in the firing process, and unusual frequencies of particular types of pottery. The nature of this evidence, however, is strongly conditioned by level of specialization, extent and continuity of pottery production, manufacturing tech- niques, and raw materials employed (Stark 1985: 182). Several lines of evidence can be pursued to argue that a set of Tomaltepec Late I features (FIG. 7) were used to fire ceramics. The first is the condition of their walls and floors, which were fire-reddened to a depth of several cm. This extent of burning was not observed on Early I or II</page><page sequence="12">302 Community Organization in Oaxaca, Mexico/Whalen N mI - fire-reddened earth adobe bricks Figure 7. Postulated pottery-firing facilities from Late I Tomaltepec. These closely resemble the "horizontal kilns" described in a variety of prehistoric and historic contexts. features at the site. It is clear that these features were used for some type of high-intensity heating that was unique to that period. Second, these heating pits are large enough for pottery firing, being ca. 1 m long, 0.5 m wide, and 0.3 m deep. They are also numerous; eight were found in the small amount of excavation done in Late I deposits, accounting for about one-third of all Late I non-structure features dug at Tomaltepec. The shape and construction of the Tomaltepec Late I features are also commensurate with ceramic manufacture. They closely resemble the horizontal kilns described for Post-Classic western Mexico (Bordaz 1964), Terminal Formative central Mexico (Redmond 1979), 2nd century A.C. England (Anderson 1985), and medieval Germany and Holland (Bordaz 1964; van der Leeuw 1976). In all these cases, horizontal kilns are trenches or roughly oblong holes. They show great variability in size. Reported lengths range from 1-5 m, widths are 0.6-2 m, and depths are 0.3-1 m. Elaborate horizontal kilns have steps or chambers formed into their floors, and floors and walls were sometimes plastered. Other, simpler horizontal kilns had flat, unplastered floors and walls. Adobe bricks or stone slabs were sometimes used to extend or shore up the walls of the pits. Internal dividers of some sort are necessary features in horizontal kilns. Bordaz (1964: 99) notes the danger of "fire-clouding," or carbon staining from contact with burning sticks, when vessels and fuel are stacked at the same level. In horizontal kiln firing, clouding is often avoided by erecting barriers of brick, clay, or even large potsherds between the ceramics and the fuel. The open tops of horizontal kilns may be covered during firing to obtain maximum control of air draft and to reduce heat loss. The medieval German kilns reviewed by Bordaz (1964: 63) apparently had clay covers, judging from the associated quantities of burned daub. Such simple covers could easily have been repaired or replaced for each firing. Tomaltepec's heavily-burned Late I pits fit well into this class of facility. Elongated or ovoid pits compose i of the Tomaltepec sample, while one other large, heavily-burned pit is nearly round. Their sizes fall within reported ranges. Rye (1981: 98) argues that pit firing is well-suited to maintenance of a reducing atmosphere, since it limits avail- able oxygen. Combination of a firing pit and a clay cover, as described above, would permit even better-controlled reduction firing. Note that one of the Valley of Oaxaca's most common Late I ceramic types is a reduction-fired grayware. Some of the Tomaltepec pits have adobe walls extending across their widths. These dividers were clearly in place during heating, as their surfaces are deeply reddened. Other pits of comparable size are equally heavily-burned, but they do not have internal walls. In two of the four walled examples, the partitions were placed off-center, cre- ating unequal-sized chambers. The brick walls abutted the pit walls, but the two were not interconnected. It would therefore have been a simple matter to remove and repo- sition them. It may be that these adobe partitions were always present when the pits were in use. There were many burned adobe brick fragments scattered among the pits, and the standing walls possibly represent only those that happened to be in place when the area was aban- doned. No other differences were apparent between walled and unwalled pits. It may also be that the movable brick walls served to control the size of the heated area,</page><page sequence="13">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 15, 1988 303 just as firebricks are used in modern kilns. Partitioning of the pits would allow different sizes or numbers of vessels to be efficiently fired in the same facility. Frequent move- ment of the partitions would also account for the broken brick rubble observed in the area of the pits. There are no traces of firing-pit covers at Tomaltepec, but few reported prehistoric horizontal kilns retain them. Neither do the Tomaltepec pits have multi-level floors or plastered interior surfaces. These characteristics were found to be variable in other prehistoric contexts as well. The contents of the Tomaltepec pits also suggest ce- ramic firing. Two sherds showing firing damage were found in one of the postulated kilns in area Ic-3. Both were Late I graywares with the swollen, spongy texture described by Rye (1981: 109) as "bloating," a condition traceable to over-firing. No other evidence of firing dam- age was observed, although the original analyses did not include a careful search for wasters. While presence of wasters is clear evidence of ceramic production, their ab- sence is not so conclusive, however. There is a New Guinea study (Lauer 1974: 199) in which no recognizable wasters could be found around an open-air firing area used by specialist and non-specialist potters. Stark (1985: 175) also reports very low frequencies of wasters (ca. 1-4%) at several prehistoric Mesoamerican pottery production locations, and cautions that "deformed wasters may be infrequent and their frequency certainly varies according to materials and technology" (1985: 175). Finally, ethnobotanical data (Smith 1981: 188) show that oak charcoal was overwhelmingly dominant in the postulated kilns. This is also consistent with a hypothesis of reduction-firing of ceramics in a controlled kiln envi- ronment. Shepard (1956:77) and Arnold (1985: 31) ar- gue that firing fuel is selected by potters because of its combustion properties, which must be appropriate to the firing problem at hand. Hard woods like oak, Shepard notes, burn slowly and evenly, and the fuel supply is not replenished during the firing episode. This promotes sus- tained high temperature and draft control, resulting in the even and thorough reduction firing evidenced by Late I graywares. In sum, the condition, number, shape, construction, and contents of the Tomaltepec Late I pits are all consistent with a pottery-production hypothesis. It is suggested that the ceramics involved were the graywares, a major class of domestic pottery all over the area. The Tomaltepec kilns were small and quite simple compared to other reported examples, but both Bordaz (1964: 57) and Rye (1981: 98) note the efficiency of even the simplest hori- zontal pit kilns in reducing heat loss and controlling firing atmosphere. It should also be noted that clay is widely available all over the Valley of Oaxaca. The Tomaltepec community lies in the valley piedmont zone, near the vast wood resources of the mountains. A permanent stream runs near the site. Clay, wood, and water were all readily available to Tomaltepec potters. Several points can be made about the community's ce- ramic manufacturing activities. First, production facilities have been suggested to have served for reduction firing of grayware ceramics, most likely the flat-bottomed bowls that are so common all over the valley at this time. Fein- man (1980: 238) describes this ware as standardized and relatively cheap to produce from widely available local clays. There was probably little or no production of luxury wares at Tomaltepec. Second, production facilities are household-associated, rather than being located in special- purpose areas removed from the residential zones. Third, these facilities were modest-sized, with at least six associ- ated with a single household unit (Ic-2). Production ap- pears to have taken place in a number of small facilities, rather than in a few large ones. Fourth, production was not limited to lower status households. Kilns were asso- ciated with household unit Ic-1, the community's most elaborate. We have few data on the proportion of Tomaltepec households that engaged in ceramic manufacture, and this limitation affects consideration of the scale of production. If many Tomaltepec Late I households had sets of firing facilities like Ic-2, the community's production would have been considerably in excess of its consumption. It may be that most Tomaltepec households had such facilities, as they were found everywhere that Late I residential unit features were excavated in any quantity. There are other indications that the general scale of ceramic manufacture increased considerably in the Valley of Oaxaca in Late I times. Feinman and his co-authors note that grayware bowls of the G-12 type were much more widely distributed over the valley than was any pre- ceding type (Feinman, Kowalewski, and Blanton 1984: 317-318). These data imply that Late I communities were producing at a level above their own requirements for the demands of a regional market system. The Tomaltepec ceramic-production data are consistent with such a model. Predictably, there is some indication that the scale of ceramic manufacture was greater at larger centers, and less at minor ones like Tomaltepec. Salvage excavations were recently conducted in a ceramic manufacturing area at San Augustin de las Juntas in the central Valley of Oaxaca. No excavation report was published, but the results of the work were briefly summarized in another source (Winter 1984). Excavated there were kilns of unspecified type, large quantities of kiln wasters, and pottery-making im-</page><page sequence="14">304 Community Organization in Oaxaca, Mexico/Whalen plements such as molds and potter's bats. The production area was found "in a prehispanic residential area located approximately 200 m west of the central mound group" (Winter 1984: 197). It is not clear whether this was a high or low status residential area. We do not know how many of the community's households produced ceramics, but it seems clear that the scale of production was consid- erably greater than at Tomaltepec. Both the Tomaltepec and the San Augustin production facilities appear to have been associated with households. The Tomaltepec community also may have contributed materials other than ceramics to the regional market sys- tem. Another pair of products likely to have been in de- mand in the densely-populated central Valley of Oaxaca were wood and charcoal. Traffic in wood is difficult to trace, because of its perishable nature and the absence of storage facilities that can be identified in the archaeological record. It may be significant that the number of ground stone axes (three) from Late I deposits at Tomaltepec equals the combined number of axes from all earlier de- posits. Large spalls broken from their bits show that these axes were used for heavy chopping, and experimental stud- ies (Saraydar and Shimada 1973) show that such tools are effective for felling trees. Analysis of charcoal from Late I deposits at Tomaltepec shows that oak, an upper piedmont tree, was much more common than in the preceding pe- riod. Arctostaphylos, a mountain tree, also appears at the site for the first time in Late I charcoal (Smith 1981: 191- 193). These carbonized wood data suggest increased focus on upper piedmont and mountain wood resources by Late I. This wood could have served the needs of the Tomal- tepec potters as well as the cooking, heating, and building requirements of the valley population. Arnold (1985: 36) shows that potters' firing fuels are often waste materials from other activities. It has also been argued (Blanton et al. 1982: 70) that Late I piedmont communities (like Tomaltepec) used ca- nal irrigation for double-crop farming to help support the large urban population at Monte Albin. Tomaltepec is well-situated for such activity, as it lies on a permanent stream, surrounded by wide expanses of gently-sloping land. Remains of two canals were found at the site. Both contained Monte Albin V (Post-Classic) sherds, plus eroded fragments that could have belonged to the Monte Albin I and II periods. The Tomaltepec community is thus seen as contributing ceramics, agricultural produce, and upper piedmont and mountain wood resources to the Monte Albin system. It has been argued that ceramic production, at least, was organized on a household basis. Accepting this, it seems most likely that other sorts of production were similarly structured. Preceding discussion suggested that Tomalte- pec households were linked together in a status continuum headed by an elite family with ties to other valley elite. Such a structure would provide an effective network through which to tie Tomaltepec's surplus production into the larger valley system. Conclusions The basic organizational units of the Tomaltepec village seem to have been household groups of markedly unequal status. At least some of these may have been larger than the nuclear family. The continuum of residential group status was headed by an elite family, itself part of a supra- community network. Nevertheless, architecture, facilities, artifacts, and mortuary practices suggest that the Tomal- tepec elite family ranked low on a valley-wide status scale. Workshop-level ceramic production took place within the Tomaltepec community, and production was organized on a household basis. The community's resident elite had some close contact with this activity, as at least one pro- duction facility is associated with the high-status house platforms. That some of the Tomaltepec elite may have been involved in ceramic production is an idea consistent with their minor position in a valley-wide elite network. The entire community is supposed to have fitted into the powerful, coherent Monte Albhin system as a "boundary" site, moving a range of products into the system. This implies that external stimuli produced much of what we see in the Tomaltepec Late I archaeological record. We have now explored a few simple ideas about the structure, organization, and function of a minor Late I center in the Valley of Oaxaca. Unfortunately, we still know little about this community or its contemporaries. We lack, for example, most details of the structure and organization of household units, the arrangement of do- mestic and workshop activities at household and supra- household levels, community composition and lay-out, the structure of authority within the community, and the na- ture and extent of the community's relations with its larger and smaller contemporaries. Our greatest problem in achieving these understandings is the small amount of excavation done to date at Late Formative communities throughout highland Mesoamerica. Cultural systems of this period in Oaxaca and elsewhere were large and di- verse. It is clear that they can only be fully understood through excavations at a range of community sizes and types. The demographic work cited earlier in this paper has provided us with a large sample of sites and with insightful regional interpretations within which to con- tinue our investigations.</page><page sequence="15">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 15, 1988 305 Acknowledgments The research on which this study was based was funded by National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant GS-40325 and by a Ford Foundation Field Training Grant made to the University of Michigan.
