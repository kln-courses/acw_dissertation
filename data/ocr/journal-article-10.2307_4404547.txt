<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERSPECTIVES Nature-Friendly Planning of Humanity's Future Dialectics and Dynamics of Development Management V R Krishna Iyer Planned development is a progess with clear goals and means. It is necessary therefore to define our ends first. If the people as a whole are our constituency surely no planning will be purposeful unless it be people-oriented. Primacy must be given to environment-propitious methodologies, not to technology in the abstract. What good are Cadillacs and Jaguars and Mercedez when roads are unkempt, narrow and unmade? SOMETIME back I participated in an international seminar on environmental planning and management. I have been feeling very unhappy about the grave dangers of callous technology intoxicated with epicurean appetites tempting men and women into inevitable doom. My thoughts are pertinent only to the extent that I, a sombre and sensitiYe inhabitant of the Earth, am in anguish as I behold the lethal prospect of hi-tech corporate power, inflicting on unforgiving Nature, mortal wounds, leading to'the Fifth Act of the Shakespearean tragedy of humanity. Karl Marx once- made a poig- nant remark: "Human projects that ignore the great laws of nature bring only disastert". How I wish Marxists remembered the pregnant meaning of this observation when in some Indian states, they disdain green movements and environmentalistcampaigns, drugged by 'an ignorant craving for industrialism, oblivious of the new dialectic, in our hi-tech world, of the'switchover from 'industrialise or perish' to 'industrialise and perish' since, in the myopic perception and insatiable hunger for maximum profit, the MNCs mayhem Nature in their gold rush. To be addicted to the religion of money, rejecting the long-term needs of humanity and its well-being in the biosphere is to gamble with the delicate balance between life and the rest of Creation. The biosphere is a supreme value and so too is the noosphere' which is an expression meaning developmental operation guided by sense and sensibility. Biosphere, so obvious a concept foryou, embraces the Earth' s surface and atmosphere in which living organisms are found and with which interaction occurs to form the global ecosystem. It is what may be termed biogeochemistry and allied matters. The sphere of life which is the biosphere includes all parts of our planet where life has 'asserted' itself - the atmosphere, the ocean and all land surface wherelifeformsexist. Lifeis the link between the cosmos and the earth and transforms dead matter, using energy, so as to create the material world. Living organisms in the process of evolution continually change. It is in the rapid march of such changes that Homo sapiens emerged amidst forests and beasts. The. extraordinary phenomenon of humans with brains became a marvellous landmark in the story of creation. The ability to use reason was part of this development of anthropogenesis. The biosphere has now another factor of change which has been called 'noosphere', the sphere of reason. The mankind thus entered the epoch of noosphere whereby further evolution was directed by reason. The collective use of reason thus took over the direction of development. Such wisdom, as a social mariner's compass, was meant to produce harmony between nature and man. If nature is wounded or environment and ecology injured, there would be reprisals where the losing end would be human civilisation. While the biosphere can do without man, man cannot exist if angry biosphere bites him. The task of technological engineering with a vision of global well- being belongs to the 'noosphere', taking cognisance of the balance in the biosphere. If technologists avariciously overstep the 'permissible threshold' humanity will have to pay a price too high to be worthwhile. Here comes the creative intelligence of systemic engineers, scientists and technologists for playing a constructive role as artists of change, delicately preserving the limits of sustainable development. The humanist perspective of modern science must remember these guidelines if indignant nature, like a wounded bear at bay, is not to inflict irre- parable, irreversible damage to global society. As we move^ towards market-friendly marijuana, materialist arrogance and global aggressiveness in production and profit, we reach a contradiction between profit- grabbing indusrialisation 'red in tooth and claw' and a pollution-free society where human happiness in good health and joy of nature is the ultimate promise. In short, here we have to draw the guidelines where the poison ofindustrialism stops and progressive, sustainable development starts. The parameters of human progress summon the statesmanship of scientists to achieve the goal of benign advance. Several years ago a study of world conservation strategy revealed: Forty per cent of humid tropical forests, which constitute the richest resources of the planet's natural environment, have already been destroyed. What remains is being uprooted and razed at a rate of 20 per cent per minute; Nineteen per cent of the land surface of the planet (or an area of 30 million square kilometres) is in danger of becoming a desert. The degradation of dry landscapes is taking place at a rate of 44 hectares per minute; Humid coastal zones and shallow a&amp;as of the seas and oceans, where two-thirds of all the world's fish reproduce, are being degraded or destroyed at the same rate as a result of the extraction of sand and shingle. as well as the burying of waste and the dumping of polluting matter; More than a thousand species of vertebrates and over 25,000 of plants are on the verge of extinction. (Grigori Khozen in Big Business Against Nature, Novosti Press Agency, Moscow, 1984, p 13). Things have become far worse as the Rio de Janeiro deliberations have revealed because the sunset of social justice and sunrise of private plunder have devalued the life of the many, for the pleasures of the few. If the jurisprudence of human justice, together with the natural and social sciences, command balanced development and distributive faimess, future shock can well be averted and prospect of plenty enhanced. Materialist incentive, labelled capitalist or socialist, is sure to exceed the norms of social justice, unless the imperatives of global survival are accepted by the sensitised engineers of science and technology and managers of planned progress. Long ago, the pitiless march of profit- making big business was described by an English trade unionist whom Karl Marx quoted in his Capital: With adequate profit, capital is very bold. A certain 10 per cent will ensure its Economic and Political Weekly August 24-31, 1996 2297</page><page sequence="2">employment anywhere; 20 per cent certain will produce eagerness; 50 percent, positive audacity; 100 per cent will make it ready to trample on all human laws; 300 per cent, and there is not a crime at which it will scruple, nor a risk it will not run, even to the chance of its owner being hanged. If turbulence and strife will being a profit, it will freely encourage both, Humanitarian and ethical criteria must create new restraints on the revelry of reckless invasion of nature. Let me quote in support a scientist of note in the former Soviet Union, Nikita Moisseyev: Our colleagues in the humanities can also play a big role. The fact is that natural scientists can indicate the limitations imposed by nature on human activity, but any restrictions or bans relating to human activity can only be put into practice by people. Here is where economists, sociologists and other scholars should take over and show how the spontaneous solution of contradictions must give way to institutions of accord. They should explain to people that the world today is quite different from what it was at the beginning and even in the middle of the 20th century. This means in effect that mankind faces the onset of an epoch that needs new ethics and new morals (Man, Nature and the Future of Civilisation, p 93, Novosti Press Agency Publishing House). It is true that the third world, vulnerable to the dictates of the first world, follows, simian fashion, the goal of unlimited economic growth wedded to an obsession with the gross national product, high technology and material achievement prodded by the MNCs which are predators of global resources. Any Gandhian critique of this immoral arrogance of giantism in growth will pronounce the present process as dangerous in the long run. Environment-friendly advance is best promoted by the Gandhian concept of 'Small Is Beautiful', as explained by Schumacher that great advocate of appropriate technology. What is big often is aggressive and ignores human values. In the words of E M Forster: It is the voice of vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness, to think that a thousand square miiles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile, and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven. Development, when operated by huge corporate engines, misses the very purpose of human happiness and in its insatiable hunger of mass production crushes the masses and ignores the central questions. Develop- ment for what purpose? Development towards what end? Development on what terms of harmony with nature? Indeed, western corporate materialist gluttony means callous mechanisation and hi-tech chemi- calisation, whetherof industry or agriculture, pharmeceuticals or macro-projects for power, irrigation or other. It means modern armies equipped with the most devastating technological weapons available. It means the endless pursuit of growth, without question as to the goals or even the shape of that growth or whether the sum of human welfare is being advanced (Third World Tomorrow by Paul Harrison, p 342). One of the essential consequences of greed gone mad, implicit in this MNC model, is the pumping in of corruption as a means for gaining darkling ends. In the case of soft states like India, power brokers, actual and potential, are won over by the purchasing power of tycoons. Massive corruption without mass indignation and each one in the assembly line of government having a price, is a systemic pathology of neo- globalisation. The structural sapping of national integrity by IMF conditionalities is an inevitable fall out of the modern scenario when the danse macabre of Multinational Corruption Incorporated (MNCI) becomes the major player in the economic South. Therefore, the moral environment, which forbids aggression on Nature, is emasculated by MNCI. All the countries where corporate power has exercised control overgovemment through money power have destroyed resources of nature like forests, rivers, clean air and pollution-free biosphere. The sweeping strategy of the global economic roll back unleashed by MNCs, with hegemony worldwide, has resulted in "the most unkindest cut of all", the infliction of wounds on the vital spots of nature contrary to what the vedic wisdom of ancient India taught humanity. Those who are concerned with environ- mental planning and management must remember: We have taught ourselves to create and combine the most powerful of technologies. We have not taken pains to learn about their consequences. Today these consequences threaten to destroy us. We must learn, and learn fast (Alvin Toffler, Future Shock, p440). Among the lessons of Earth Summit Conference the world must learn are the following: (1) The North, comprising 20 per cent of the world's population and consuming 80 per cent of its reserves (the US consumes the lion's share), is reluctant to take any initiatitive to save humanity from environ- mental degradation and the adversities of underdevelopment. Have the 'haves' ever in history shared with the 'have-nots' a holistic strategy to make all humanity a global brotherhood in development, environment and ecology save under the soul force of cosmic collective conscience which is the locomotive of history? (2) Victory comes once the South stands together and awareness dawns on the North that the Earth is environmentally indivisible. (3) The prognosis is bright if the nations, weak and strong, present a united front against eco-imperialism. (4) Finally, as the Brazilian president underscored on the eve of the Rio Summit: "You can't have an environmentally healthy planet in a world that is socially unjust". (5) Have the nations any recipeforsuccess? Such a viable proposal is what Mahathir Mohammed made: A global fund, financed by national contributions assessed on the basis of population and carbon dioxide emissions, would be created to assure the success of this vast effort at reforestation and new forestation. Such a project would not only solve, at least partially, one of the world's most important environmental problems, it would also exemplify an approach to saving the earth through co-operative efforts that are fair and just for all, not merely for the North. Environment, ecology, population, poverty and life in luxury, all have an impact on the escalating Global disorder. Compassion towards ecology and environment is a casualty if we jettison the imperatives of environmental preservation prompted by myopic avarice. With the ideal of power over Nature, demanded passion seeks to programme the technological golden goose for speedier and speedier outputs of whatever we desire. Perfection has limits. Power has none. Need has limits. Greed has none. The limits of this biosphere are set by the laws of Nature. In the laws of Nature, we should hail our saviours. Our only chance of resurrection lies in total alignment with them [Animal Welfare and Nature: HINDU Scriptural Perspectives by G Naganathan, p 22]. Our current culture is dominated by know- how without caring for know-why. Seduced by the North: We are always seeking a better, more efficient, more powerful, more instantaneous route to carelessly examined ends. Now the most dangerous brand of determinism is the technological. Science began as a human tool; now humans are its victims, and science is dragging us down a path no longer of our own choosing [Ibid, p 221 Mesmerised by such vulgarity the masses of the south miss the essence of whatGandhiji in India and Masanobu Furooka irn Japan taught us. There is a moral obligation on the part of the intellectuals to abandon the greed (of the few) and fulfil the needs (of the masses) as the 'dharma' our our times. Our culture of ancient vintage bears testimony to the wisdom of living in reverence for all of Nature's creations and behold it as a way of life, a necessity of survival and a spiritual value. These introductory observations of mine, if valid, can be fleshed out beautifully by environmental planners and managers. The philosophy of the Vedas and Upanishads, the sermons of Jesus and the universal brotherhood of Muhammad when lifted to the 21st century, will be a moral monitor 2298 Economic and Political Weekly August 24-31, 1996</page><page sequence="3">and spiritual teacher to the developmental technologists and advisers of planning. Planned development is a process with clear goals and means which will advance, not defeat the objectives. So we must define our ends first. If the people, as a whole, are our constituency surely no planning will be purposeful unless it be people-oriented. If the environment is hostile, plans will be frustrated. So primacy must be given to environment-propitious methodology, not technology in the abstract or under totally different conditions or popular milieus. This is too obvious to be emphasised. What would be the point of having Cadillacs and Mercedez and Jaguars where roads are narrow? Fast foods and bar parlours, where people are poor and wages low, are incompatible with distributive justice or socialistic pattern of society. Likewise, management is conditioned by relevant factors of human habits and residential facilities. All said and done, science is at the service of a given society, not the other way about. The democratic commitment and culture are determinants which science and technology must consider. They are instruments to solve problems of a country, not to impose themselves on a community, giving rise to new problems. So it is that exotic arts are not answers where ground realitieaand people's ethods are incongruous. Progress, to be authentic, must achieve an internal integrity and social morality. These are imperatives of environmental planning and management. What I have stated above applies to the north as much as to the South. This caveat of ecological consequences of the private entrepreneurship was uttered by president Theodore Roosevelt. In a special message he warned his countrymen: The natural resources of our country are in danger of exhaustion if we permit the old wasteful methods of exploiting them longer to continue... The time has come to inquire seriously what will happen when our forests are gone, when the coal, the iron, the oil, and the gas are exhausted, when the soils shall have been still further impoverished and washed into the streams, polluting the rivers, denuding the fields, and obstructing navigation... It is time for us now as a nation to exercise the same reasonable foresight in dealing with our great natural resources that would be shown by any prudent man in conserving and wisely using the property which contains the assurance of well-being for himself and his children (quoted in Big BusinessAgainstNature by Grigori Khozen, pp 17-18). Look at the contradictions of progress in the US which must dialectically educate us. Stewart Udall, ex-secretary of the interior, described the situation in 1960 thus: This nation leads the world in wealth and power, but also leads in the degradation of the human habitat. We have the most automobiles and the worst junkyards. We are the most mobile people on earth and we endure the worst congestion. We produce the most energy and have the foulest air. Our factories pour out more products and our rivers carry the heaviest loads of pollution (Ibid, p 18). Nixon, as president, pledged that "environmental quality would be the third great goal of the New American Revolution". Ronald Reagan, while he was governor of California, told his electorate: There is no subject more on our minds than the preservation of our environment and the absolute necessity of waging an all-out war against the debauching of that environment (Ibid, p 19). Market friendliness is a euphemism for open sesame to big business whose focus is on quick bucks, even if it makes public good bankrupt: In the early 1970s the influential weekly US News and World Report revealed that as a result of a continuous deterioration in the quality of the working environment and of increased pollution at US factories, at least 1,00,000 people were dying every year and another 3,90,000 were being seriously disabled. In the Federal Republic of Germany, the number of people suffering from hearing defects due to factory noise in the 1960s rose 13.5 times compared with the previous decade; and the number of industrial workers suffering from skin diseases has been growing fast. In Sweden, an examination of workers employed in copper smelting works showed an increasing number of deaths due to cancer of lungs, blood disease, cirrhosis of the liver and cardio-vascular disease. Medical men are alarmed at the continuous growth of hereditary diseases and even deformities among working-class children. There is no evidence that the corporations have radically changed their attitude to environment protection. Between 1974 and 1980 the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigated 340 cases of violation by major corporations of the laws concerning air and waterpollution. The fines forthese violations exceed 55 million dollars. The biggest fine - 18.9 million dollars - was imposed on the United States Steel Company. One American voluntary group calling for more rigid control over the use of nuclear energy has calculated that in 1979 alone there were 2,300 breakdowns and accidents at atomic power and nuclear fuel plants in the US. Many of them caused considerable ecological dam-age (Big Business Against Nature by Grigori Khozin, pp 19-20). We thus find the world's corporate controllerate dominating the processes of production in our planet, degrading environment and damaging ecology. We thus discover that globalism in the hands of corporate terrorism makes nature a graveyard and a Junkyard. With all the promises the MNCs may make, there is no code of ethics for them, no legal hand cuffs and measures of punishment in case of violation. Ralph Nader, long ago wrote about ineffective application of laws when the culprit is a corporate. He tartly observes: Rarely is the law invoked against corporate violence, but when it is, the prosecutional penalty or equitable remedy is applied to the corporate shell and not to those officials who make corporate policy. It is almost axiomatic that irresponsibility toward public interests becomes institutionalised whenever the making of decisions is so estranged from any accountability for their discernible consequences... Unsafely designed automobiles, pollution, harmful food additives, and other contaminants embody a silent kind of violence with indeterminate, unpredictable incidence per victim. That impact does not provoke immediate sensory response of pain or anguish directed at the source of the harm. Such harm does not come in the anthropomorphic form that is apparently so necessary to motivate action. Corporate- induced violence illustrates in compelling fashion the biological obsolescence of human beings toward machine, chemical, or other injurious exposures emanating from the technology of corporate groups. Our sensory apparatus, adapted to cruder and older forms of visible hazards, cannot detect carbon monoxide or radiation until it is too late. Soon, this widening gap between the obsolete mechanisms of man's physiology and the multiple, cumulative impacts of his technology may mark the confines of the struggle for planetary survival - even should peace between nations prevail. The mind of man must abstract what is happening more rapidly, for the body of man provides few early alert signals. Corporate fraud and other economic crimes similarly escape the normative perception that would be applied, for example, to a pickpocket by most people. From educational to media systems, people are not afforded adequate opportunities to learn about and ethically evaluate price- fixing, adulteratex citrus, juices, hams, and poultry, deliberately fragile bumpers, unperformed but billed-for services, suppression of life-giving innovations, and many other crimes which bilk the consumer, in Senator Philip Hart's estimate, of some 200 billion yearly (in the introduction to the book America Inc by Morton Mintz and Jerry S Cohen, pp 12-13). All these fundamental flaws and systemic failures are a menace to whole populations. The hazards to health, life and property are escalating, because of reckless industrialisation. Scientists know perfectly well that built-in safeguards can prevent pollution, careful planning can pre-empt community calamities, toxic industrial effluents and the like. But corporate behaviour and the corrupt clout hold the law at bay and corporate crime rarely comes to light as Bofors th; security scam and the hawala ou trage et al demonstrate Economic and Political Weekly August 24-31, 1996 2299</page><page sequence="4">undetected business crimes, tycoon culpability and communities being held to ransom in the economic field - the new AID syndrome are ballooning, what with the new economic policy showing undue hospitality to dubious industrialists a la Enron backed by almighty dollar. The legal process is too weak and dilatory; so much so, blue-chip corporate recidivists are rarely caught and more rearely convicted. Why? Because obiquitous corruption is the master of every situation. We need ajurisprudence with better invigilative capacity, finer social sensitivity and stronger, prompter punitive processes. Is the only solution to make science and technology the vanguard of social advancement? What we need is universalism in blessing humanity as a whole with the basics of a good life, not abundance for small affluent oases and appalling indigent deserts for the rest world. A transformation of consciousness which indivisibly bind us all is the desideratum. Here, it is here, environmental planners and global tech- nological managers have the role of plane- tary patriotism to play. Markets make no meaning, luxury goods are but illusion, five star culture has no relevance, if science and technology are not humanised to benefit the humble and their blessings universalised. Alas, although formally socialist, the new trend in India is geared to survival of the fittest in competitive cannibalism. I see a degeneracy from the days of Gandhi and Nehru to the later Moghuls in Delhi, whose cults of epicurean 'affluenza' and 'west is best', have inhibited the creativity of the common people putting all the developmental eggs in the M N C basket. The M N Cs have no body to be burned, and no soul to be damned. Therefore, scientists must be the custodians of development where common people matter. Unfortunately, those in power are pachydermic. An apt quote which spells out the patrician pathology of the power elite runs thus: We have numbed ourselves so that we do not feel the pain. We have to be asleep in order to protect ourselves from the horror of knowing that twenty-eight people, most of them young children, are dying this very minute - twenty-eight people no different from you or me or our children, except that we have food and they do not. We have closed down our consciousness and aliveness to a level where it doesn't bother us. So if you wonder if it costs us anything to allow millions to starve, it does. It costs us our aliveness (The Aquarian Conspiracy by Marilyn Ferguson, p 456). The scientific talent of the South, especially of India, is a large resource which can, if developed, accomplish self-reliance, indigenous initiatives and meet the needs of populations cheaper and better. Food self- reliance without imported fertilisers and pesticides, industrial development pressing into service material available within the country and organising 'appropriate technology' for generation of power and avoidance of pollution are the new lines scientist-humanists must follow. Distributive justice, not isolated opulence, freedom from colonialism, not dependency syndrome, are the route to material salvation of third world humanity. World hunger is big business for MNCs, liquidation of the public sector and people's sector the policy of the IMF so that our national economics may drag on crutches. Trade traps; chemical traps, debt traps and death traps are the portents if the reservoir of scientific talent and genius cannot be motivated by a patriotism committed to the abolition of privation so as to go into concrete action with a focus on the specifics of each country. We need, therefore, a new world science-technology order, a new world economic order, where human solidarity prevails overkilkenny cat competitive market ideology. This is a summons for a new faith in the universal happiness of humanity. Walden Beilo, in his book Dark Victory, has a concluding paragraph which emphasises: that human rights, peace, and environmental welfare are indivisible and transcend the boundaries set by state-limits supported by corporate capital in the name of 'national sovereignty' when it suits its objectives. It is the universalising logic of labour solidarity, community, equity and ecological sustainability that confronts the increasingly destructive combination of corporate expansionism, political counter-revolution, and tribal retrogression in the North. While the former still has to attain a critical mass, it is by no means preordained that the future belongs to the latter (p 115). The foremost principle is reverence for environment and ecology. Growth that does not respect the natural world, its complexity and its sensitivity, limits itself. Resources are exhausted, ecosystems collapse, species disappear and our own physical and mental health and even our survival are threatened. Mankind has reached a point where it is not enough to develop material wealth. It must now learn how to distribute that wealth fairly, and how to develop all humans to their full physical and psychological potential, in harmony with nature. West, East and South should be engaged in a process of learning from each other the concrete ways of achieving this (The Third World Tomorrow by Paul Harrison, p 350). Sensitive researchers, with a sense of accountability to humanity must fight the destructive diversion of natural and human resources for nuclear and otherkiller purposes and arsenals of weapons. Likewise, our wastes must be converted into wealth, our filth turned to good use by a Midas touch, and our native resources exploited to serve better than imported glitter. Let me cite a Kerala instance. Eco-friendly botanical pesticides must be tried seriously. Pesticides, often add to the problem of pests. For example, Kuttanad (Kerala): faces the threat of a resurgence of pests and diseases in its paddy tracts, as the management of pest and disease control affairs has fallen into the hands of pesticides companies. What is worrying the agricultural scientists is the ruthless marketing techniques adopted by some of these companies (P Venugopal in an article titled 'Pesticides Add to Problems of Pests', The Hindu, dated February 8, 1995, p 5). Our industries can put waste water to use. Our food processing can be designed with effluent treatment plants. So too our breweries, tanneries and instant coffee manufacturing plants. Our drug companies must be convicted of environmental guilt but can be given probation if only they adopt neutralisation methods. Health from bacteria, aquatic plants and other innovative wastes must be pressed into service. Our native pharmaceutical wealth has much to offer to healing humanity's suffering. Let us not patent away our ancient recipes and betray our treasury of herbs and pharmacopea evolved over millennia for a few pieces of silver. We must be guided by the values of a moral order,not the appetites of a sensual system. Martin Luther King Jr rightly stressed: The means by which we live have out- distanced the ends for which we live. Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power. We have guided missiles and misguided men. Loony industrialism may visit mankind with punitive justice, unless we change our development course. Regrettably, the victimology flowing out of distored technology may well visit misfortune over the innocent vast. There is no Noah's Arc even for the North. All will perish and none survive if the scientists' sector, exercising autonomy and swearing by humane convictions and liberating its conscience from corporate temptations, does not assert itself with spiritual authority and refusal to bend before political-military-corporate domination. Winston Churchill once said: The dark ages may return - the stone age may return on the gleaming wings of science; and what might now shower immeasurable material blessings upon mankind may even bring about its total destruction. Beware, I say! Time may be short. In the present world crisis, the collective call to all humanity, especially the scientists and researchers, teachers and technologists, is 'do or die'. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep. 2300 Economic and Political Weekly August 24-31, 1996</page></plain_text>
