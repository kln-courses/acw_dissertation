AT first glance the reader fears that this book will be one of those life-and-letters biographies, a genre that quite fortunately has gone out of fashion. It consists of long quotations from letters and reminiscences tied together by passages of what is almost editorial prose. The impression may be true, but this is an ex- ceptional case. Gideon Lincecum was an unclassifiable original who wrote</page><page sequence="2">906 Reviews of Books colorfully and well; Mrs. Burkhalter has chosen wisely to let him speak for himself. While Lincecum was a man of many interests, his biography should be most useful to students of the southeril frontier, whose child he was. Born in Georgia, reared there and in western South Carolina, he was eventually an Indian trader and physician in Mississippi, a farmer in Texas, and, for a time, a member of the Confederate refugee colony in Mexico. Quite apart from his wanderings, Lincecum has significance for his record of Choctaw myths and, in his later years, for his work in natural history. The latter may have been an outgrowth of his largely self-taught botanical medicine. He did correspond with various members of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, with Spencer F. Baird of the Sinithsonian, and even with Charles Darwin, who read Lincecum's somewhat anthropomorphic account of "agricultural ants" to a skeptical Linnaean Society of London. Burkhalter's treatment of Lincecum is sympathic and competent. The topical arrangement of the volume does create a certain amount of repetition even as it clarifies the many aspects of Lincecum's career. My principal complaint is that footnotes are confined to identifications while citations are lumped together in "A Note on Sources" at the end of each chapter. University of Delaware GEORGE F.
