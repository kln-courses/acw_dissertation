<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARVARD LAW REVIEW VOL. LVII SEPTEMBER, 1944 No. 7 INSURANCE AS COMMERCE IN CONSTITUTION AND STATUTE ON June 5, I944, in United States v. South-Eastern Under- writers Association 1 a minority of the Supreme Court of the United States with effective power in the premises held a group of fire insurance companies properly indictable under the Sherman Act,2 thus ruling that the acts charged in the indictment consti- tuted a combination in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states and an attempt to monopolize some part of such trade or commerce. The decree reversed the decision of the dis- trict court which in deference to hitherto impeccable controlling authority had sustained a demurrer to the indictment. The minor- ity of four had momentary effective power because only seven of the Justices took part in the case. We are not told why Justices Roberts and Reed did not sit. The latter may possibly have recused himself because of some association with the prosecution when he was Solicitor General. Had both he and Mr. Justice Roberts been free to hear and determine, we might surmise from their earlier alignments in split decisions that the decree would have gone the other way. Whether in later litigation in which they are not disqualified they will decline to respect as authoritative these views of a court minority, is still in the lap of the Constitu- tion. What respect such minority assumption of reverse leader- ship should command from mere observers, though of necessity of 1 64 Sup. Ct. 1162 (June 5, I944). 2 26 STAT. 209 (I890), 15 U. S. C. ?

A gracious pursuer of the judicial course might pay the minority quartette a delicate compliment, too delicate perhaps for acid analysis, by emulating their courage and independence and thus viewing their views as they viewed those of their predecessors. Before venturing upon an examination of the intricacies of the competing arguments and the opposing conclusions of the par- ticipating Justices, it is pertinent to review earlier decisions bear- ing upon the question whether insurance is commerce and the question whether the insurance business may constitutionally be subjected to some form of the national commerce power. The two questions are by no means identical, as we are now made clearly aware by the scope authoritatively given to acts of Con- gress dealing with railroads, collective bargaining, wages and hours, crop restriction, and possibly with corporate organization and finance. The difference between the two issues sheds some light on the significance and the insignificance of the determina- tion of a minority of the Court to translate their views into a de- cree in the particular case. If the decision were quite unnecessary to sanction national power over insurance combinations, it may in one aspect be regarded as insignificant. If it involved a strained and unwarranted interpretation of a fifty-year old statute, it has significance as an illustration of unrestraint by any self-denying ordinance on the part of some who most strongly preach the gos- pel of judicial self-limitation. I The question whether insurance is commerce first arose in Paul v. Virginia 3 in 1869 and was decided in the negative by a unani- mous court. The case concerned a conviction of an agent of a foreign corporation for issuing a policy without having obtained the license required by the state. He had applied for a license and had offered to comply on behalf of himself and his company with all the provisions of the statute except the one requiring the deposit of bonds with the state treasurer. For failure to do this, he was denied a license. He nevertheless issued a policy of in- surance. The state did not require the deposit of bonds by do- 3 8 Wall. i68 (U. S.

On this ground it was urged that the discrimination violated the constitutional provision that "The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immu- nities of Citizens in the several States." 4 The judicial answer was that corporations are not citizens and that their stockholders cannot invoke the clause as individual citizens when seeking some- thing other than the privileges and immunities of individual citi- zens. The greater part of the opinion was concerned with this issue. Mr. Justice Field dealt somewhat summarily with the conten- tion based on the commerce clause. He recognized that corpora- tions may claim the benefits of this clause, but he went on to say: The defect of the argument lies in the character of their business. Issuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of commerce. The policies are simple contracts of indemnity against loss by fire, entered into between the corporations and the assured, for a consideration paid by the latter. These contracts are not articles of commerce in any proper meaning of the word. They are not subjects of trade and barter offered in the market as something having an existence and value independent of the parties to them. They are not commodities to be shipped or forwarded from one State to another, and then put up for sale. They are like other personal contracts between parties which are completed by the signature and the transfer of the consideration .. .5 Since the analysis of the insurance transaction was given to show the character of the insurance " business," there would seem to be no room here to impute to the Court any distinction between the insurance contract and the insurance business. If the mere giving of a promise to pay money on a contingency is not " trade," a mul- tiple of such promises is not trade. To have trade, a commodity must be involved. The policy is not a commodity. There is no denial that the " business " is pecuniary, but that does not make it trade. The policy has no independent value of its own, as does a blanket or a horse. It is not subject to unrestricted sale by the recipient. This would seem sufficient to dispose of the case and of the business of insurance companies so long as such business is con- fined to insurance. Mr. Justice Field, however, was not content to rest here. Much more questionably, he continued: 4 U. S. CONST. ART. IV, ? 2, ~ i. 5 8 Wall. at 183.</page><page sequence="4">940 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 Such contracts are not inter-state transactions, though the parties may be domiciled in different States. The policies do not take effect- are not executed contracts - until delivered by the agent in Virginia. They are, then, local transactions, and are governed by the local law. They do not constitute a part of the commerce between the States any more than a contract for the purchase and sale of goods in Virginia by a citizen of New York whilst in Virginia would constitute a portion of such com- merce.6 Surely there is much more interstateness to the insurance transac- tion which requires communication across state lines than to the purchase of a horse which does not. If what were involved were a sale of goods, the fact that the contract did not become " exe- cuted " until a soliciting agent delivered the goods to the pur- chaser would not keep the sale from being interstate.7 If the policy itself were a subject of sale, the sale would be interstate if the policy crossed the state line in response to the order.8 The situation, however, might be different if the local agent makes out the policy himself on blanks previously received.9 This may have been the case at bar, but the judicial remarks were not confined to such a case. On the commerce issue, Mr. Justice Field invoked apposite authority when he said: In Nathan v. Louisiana [8 How. 73 (U. S. 1850) ], this court held that a law of that State imposing a tax on money and exchange brokers, who 6 8 Wall. at 183. 7 Caldwell v. North Carolina, I87 U. S. 622 (I903); Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v.

Later cases are collected in Lockhart, The Sales Tax in Interstate Commerce (I939) 52 HARV. L. REV. 617, 633, n.56. Some subsequent decisions seem to shade the rule and to require that to make the sale interstate the contract must absolutely require fulfillment by shipment from outside the state. These cases, however, had to do not with specific license fees but with sales taxes, and they are precursors of the later decision in McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co. (309 U. S. 33 (I940)), which sanctions a sales tax in the buyer's state when the vendor receives the order at a place of business therein. It seems warranted to assume that in dealing with specific anticipatory license fees the Court will continue to look at the actual course of business and will not require that the contract must expressly stipulate that the subject of the sale must be shipped in from outside the state.

The individual thus using his money and credit, said the court, "is not engaged in commerce, but in supplying an instrument of com- merce. He is less connected with it than the shipbuilder, without whose labor foreign commerce could not be carried on." And the opinion shows that, although instruments of commerce, they are the subjects of State regulation, and, inferentially, that they may be subjects of direct taxa- tion.10 That case involved not merely the giving of a promise to pay, but also the transfers of existing promises to pay. It involved, as insurance often involves, a transaction useful or essential to what is concededly interstate commerce. This, however, is not enough to make the ancillary transaction one in commerce so as to be immune from state power. In the Nathan case it was only this ancillary feature which introduced any element of something not wholly local. The transaction was otherwise clearly local, though Mr. Justice Field quotes a foolish reason in Mr. Justice McLean's opinion for holding it such." On the commerce issue the Nathan precedent is applied by saying that " If foreign bills of exchange may thus be the subject of State regulation, much more so may contracts of insurance against loss by fire." 12 Our concern with Paul v. Virginia and its legitimate offspring is not to pronounce whether in their day and generation they were wise but whether they established so settled a doctrine that abrupt and violent departures from it may be questioned as unwise. The late Gerard Henderson in his brilliant study, The Position of For- eign Corporations in American Constitutional Law,'3 has traced the intellectual source of what he calls the " restrictive theory " 10 8 Wall. at 184. 11 At 8 Wall. at I84, Mr. Justice Field quotes from Nathan v. Louisiana as fol- lows: " Now, the Federal government can no more regulate the commerce of a State than a State can regulate the commerce of the Federal government; and domestic bills or promissory notes are as necessary to the commerce of a State as foreign bills to the commerce of the Union. And if a tax on an exchange broker who deals in foreign bills be a regulation of foreign commerce, or commerce among the States, much more would a tax upon State paper, by Congress, be a tax on the commerce of a State." [8 How. at 82.] This of course is absurd, since the federal taxing power is not confined within the limits of the national commerce power. 12 8 Wall. at 184-85. 13 (I918).</page><page sequence="6">942 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 of corporations. This theory makes a foreign corporation a pa- riah, and the theory has wide constitutional acceptance except when the corporation is engaged in interstate commerce or in business with the federal government. As Mr. Henderson points out, corporations in earlier days were created by special act often secured by favorite sons who thereby obtained extraordinary and often monopolistic privileges. Could these fortunate few take their powers with them into sister states with no barriers inter- vening, the chartering state would be exercising extraterritorial sway. Against financial corporations such as banks and insurance companies, each state had especial need for self-protection. If such foreign corporations could claim immunities as citizens or as engaged in interstate commerce, the results might be disastrous to the communities to which they had free entry. It raises a neat issue of intellectual ethics whether a Court should be influenced in deciding whether insurance is or is not commerce by reflection on the consequences in the framework of the federal system. It can hardly be denied that when a choice is open, such considerations often enter. There is certainly no strain in differentiating banking and insurance from trade and transpor- tation. If the presence of a pecuniary element were alone enough to make anything commerce, the teacher, the preacher, the law- yer, the actor, and all other laborers for hire would be engaged in commerce and could be held to be engaged in interstate com- merce when their enterprise requires communication across state lines. The line which for many years the Court has drawn with more or less distinctness is one not lightly to be obliterated. Per- sonal service and a personal obligation in return for a merely personal obligation with no element of exchange of anything but promises are strikingly different from the recognized commerce enterprises of trade and transportation. In long recognized con- stitutional parlance such monetary mutual obligations are not trade, and it belies the past to subject them to the verbal baptism of " trade." The cases following and applying Paul v. Virginia make clear that the constitutional classification of insurance as not commerce applies to the insurance business and not merely to an isolated transaction of issuing a policy. In i87I Ducat v. Chicago 14 sanc- 14 IO Wall. 4Io (U. S. I87I).</page><page sequence="7">I944] INSURANCE AS COMMERCE 943 tioned a discriminatory tax on foreign insurance companies and affirmed state power to discriminate as it pleases. Fifteen years later Philadelphia Fire Association v. New York 15 upheld a dis- criminatory retaliatory tax on foreign companies. Mr. Justice Blatchford said that " The State, having the power to exclude entirely, has the power to change the conditions of admission at any time, for the future ....6 While the insurance company fought only under the banner of the Fourteenth Amendment, Mr. Justice Blatchford was careful to conclude by saying: It is not to be implied, from anything we have said, that the power of a State to exclude a foreign corporation from doing business within its limits is to be regarded as extending to an interference with the transac- tion of commerce between that State and other States by a corporation created by one of such other States.17 Thus these cases on insurance corporations treated them like other foreign corporations not engaged in interstate commerce. Had there been any judicial suspicion that the insurance business is "trade," such state power of exclusion and discrimination could not have been sanctioned without further inquiries that were never considered necessary. Such was the clear constitutional line of demarcation before the enactment of the Sherman Act, and the record is bare of any Congressional effort to transgress it. Constitutional law is of course subject to judicial repeal, as we well know, although nor- mally such repeal is dependent upon some legislative initiation. One who would seek any such Congressional impulse in I890 to urge the Supreme Court to discover that insurance is trade and therefore is commerce has an unusually heavy burden. There may be justifications for applying Supreme Court artistry to make the Constitution a chameleon when previous decisions have been strongly contested by dissenters and commentators from the mo- ment of rendition. Such justifications have no application to any judicial instinct to make a statute a chameleon fifty years after its enactment. Congress has a continuous vocal capacity of its own which the Constitution as a document cannot emulate. With- out being unduly anthropomorphic in thinking of Congress as a being with an individual mind, there are still strong reasons why 15 II9 U. S.

Supreme Court decisions on the commerce issue subsequent to the Sherman Act may technically have no bearing upon the proper interpretation of the statute. If, however, such decisions follow and reinforce the distinction previously established, they may be accorded some moral as well as psychological weight. They may show what later Courts deemed to be the earlier law. They may show what the legal fraternity and their clients had a right to assume as to the scope of a statute imposing criminal penalties on conduct defined in part in constitutional terms. Our Anglo-Saxon traditions confer no especial hallowing grace upon surprise retroactive interpretations of a criminal statute, even if some of the victims have a possible loophole of escape through the clemency of some subordinate doctrine.'8 The surprise may leave so uncertain the requisites of lawful conduct, present and future, for those affected that they will not know how to steer between the Scylla and Charybdis of state and national impera- tives. They can have no confidence that further surprise inter- pretations and applications will not follow. Whatever may be the merits of whimsical government, they are confined to prospec- tive clarities. In tracing the paths of judicial distinction since the Sherman Act, we may dispose briefly of the cases dealing with transporta- tion. They have no bearing on the question whether one who is not a transporter is engaged in commerce. It is clear that all human transporters are engaged in interstate commerce if they bear their burdens across state lines. Their enterprise need not be pecuniary. They may carry whiskey for their own consump- tion 19 or friends for their own enjoyment.20 They need not bear burdens on their shoulders or on their rails. They may float logs 18 At the close of his opinion in the South-Eastern Underwriters case, Mr. Justice Black appends the following statement: "Whether reliance on earlier statements of this Court in the Paul v. Virginia line of cases that insurance is not 'commerce' could ever be pleaded as a defense to a criminal prosecution under the Sherman Act is a question which has been suggested but one it is not necessary to discuss at this time." 64 Sup.

When no human being engineers the transit, there has been doubt, but the uncer- tainty about migratory birds 29 may have been resolved by affirm- ing the power of Congress over wandering cows 30 if not by the earlier restriction of state power over shepherded sheep.3' So much for transportation. The insurance business is not a transportation enterprise. The fact that it makes use of trans- portation and communication furnished by others may bring it within Congressional control when policies and letters cross state lines, but this does not establish that insurance any more than agriculture is commerce. Sanction of regulation of transportation to control what is dependent upon it did not turn these depend- encies into what the official interpreters of the Constitution re- garded as commerce itself. The cases dealing with business other than transportation fall into two groups. The first is concerned with unsuccessful efforts to invoke the commerce clause in resistance to state power. Cases on insurance followed and applied Paul v. Virginia and made clear that the kind of insurance is not material and that the decisions apply to the business of insurance and not merely to the policy contract. The cases sanctioned the power of the state to regulate the provisions of contracts issued by companies outside the state upon applications submitted by an agent authorized to do busi- 21 Coe v.

They had to do with objections to established rules denying Fourteenth Amend- ment protection to foreign corporations or were based on Four- 32 New York Life Ins. Co. v. Cravens (178 U. S. 389 (900o)) applied Missouri law to a life insurance policy solicited in Missouri by an agent of a New York com- pany duly admitted to do business in Missouri. The application was sent to New York and the policy was there issued and transmitted to Missouri by the company to its agent, who delivered it to the assured. The company contended that the parties had a right to stipulate as to the law of which state should be applicable, but the Court held that such business was subject to the Missouri law. The opinion of Mr. Justice McKenna on the commerce issue was brief, citing the earlier cases and quoting from Hooper v. California (see note 33 infra). 33 Hooper v. California, I55 U. S. 648 (I895). In rejecting the contention that marine insurance differed from other kinds of insurance, Mr. Justice White said: "It ignores the real distinction upon which the general rule and its exceptions are based, and which consists in the difference between interstate commerce or an in- strumentality thereof on the one side and the mere incidents which may attend the carrying on of such commerce on the other. This distinction has always been care- fully observed, and is clearly defined by the authorities cited. If the power to regu- late interstate commerce applied to all the incidents to which such commerce might give rise and to all contracts which might be made in the course of its transaction, that power would embrace the entire sphere of mercantile activity in any way con- nected with trade between the States; and would exclude state control over many contracts purely domestic in their nature." "The business of insurance is not commerce. The contract of insurance is not an instrumentality of commerce. The making of such a contract is a mere incident of commercial intercourse, and in this respect there is no difference whatever be- tween insurance against fire and insurance against 'the perils of the sea.'" Id. at 655. Noble v. Mitchell (164 U. S. 367 (I896)) followed the Hooper case in applying a statute with a provision that the agent securing the policy from an unlicensed company should be personally liable. The case does not tell how the policy was obtained and so is not by itself authority on the interstate feature. Nutting v. Massachusetts (I83 U. S. 553 (I902)) sustained the conviction of a licensed insurance broker in Massachusetts who as the local agent of New York insurance brokers secured from a Boston shipbuilder authority to place insurance on a ship under construction. He delivered to the assured a policy issued by a com- pany not admitted to do business in Massachusetts which he had received by mail from the New York brokers. Here Mr. Justice Harlan alone dissented, thinking the case like that of Allgeyer v. Louisiana (165 U. S. 578 (1897)), in which the Court held that the defendant, who had effected a contract of insurance by mail in New York, could not be convicted in Louisiana under a statute which made it a crime to do any act leading to the insuring of Louisiana property with a company which had not complied with the laws of Louisiana.</page><page sequence="11">1944] INSURANCE AS COMMERCE 947 teenth Amendment conceptions of the liberty of individuals other than soliciting agents or on a belief that the state was exercising its power extraterritorially. The decisions made clear that what is not commerce cannot become interstate commerce. Renewed reaffirmation of the long-established doctrine was given in an extensive opinion by Mr. Justice McKenna in New York Life Insurance Co. v. Deer Lodge County,3 decided in 1913. The case involved a Montana tax on the excess of premiums over losses and ordinary expenses. The company invoked the com- merce clause and emphasized the extent to which ultimate deci- sions were made at the home office in New York and the extent to which all the transactions required use of the mails between New York and Montana. Its leading counsel on the brief and on the argument was Dean Roscoe Pound. The brief made a crit- ical examination of the earlier cases and pointed to distinctions in the facts between them and the case at bar. It contended that " In the case at bar the essential point is, not that the insurance business is the source of the transactions in question, but that the state is obstructing business that is wholly interstate business." 3 It invoked history to show the object and purpose of the commerce clause and argued that the evils of unrestricted state power over insurance are precisely those which the commerce clause was de- signed to prevent. It contended that the cases on lottery tickets 36 and correspondence schools 37 required limitation of Paul v. Vir- ginia to insurance contracts clearly intrastate. 34 23I U.

Virginia. Justices Hughes and Van Devanter dissented, but without opinion. Mr. Justice Hughes knew some- thing about the insurance business. He was aware that state regulation had not always proven effective against financial evils. Whether he and Mr. Justice Van Devanter were concerned about the obstructive annoyances of having to comply with the varying laws of forty-eight states, whether they accepted the argument that the transmission of money is the transmission of property, whether they thought that the transportation cases so strongly relied on by the company were applicable to a business other than a transportation business, whether they accepted the contention that the case involved the issue of a denial of regulatory power to Congress concomitantly with the issue of sanction of power to the states, we do not know, welcome as it would be to have been told. On far less important matters, dissenters do not maintain reticence today. Whatever the grounds of dissent they won only two votes. One of the votes is entitled to great respect. The other may have been influenced by a general attitude averse to all sorts of govern- mental regulation. The similar dominance of laissez-faire atti- tudes among not a few predecessors makes even more significant the line of decisions subjecting foreign insurance corporations to the control of the states in which policyholders live, particularly when these decisions came at a time when federal regulation of insurance was not being pressed. What the Supreme Court would have decided about state power over insurance in I9I3 as an use the cashier, and the deposit subject only to the company's draft made by him, as a means of such transmission; (5) the one sends to the student from time to time 'instruction papers' and letters containing information and instruction; the other sends to the insured or the beneficiary, through checks drawn on a New York bank and transmitted to such assured or beneficiary, the amount of loans on the policy, of matured endowments, and of death losses. In each case all this 'current of com- merce between the states ' grows necessarily out of and is required by the scholarship or the policy. But in the case of the policies in the plaintiff company, because of the larger amounts involved and their much longer duration, this current of com- merce in the transmission of annual premiums to, and in other dealings with, the Home Office is very much the greater."

It was not an original question, and the fact of an undeviating course of decision was given its deserved weight by Mr. Justice Mc- Kenna.38 A modification of doctrine here would have done no more at the moment than to save a foreign corporation from a particular tax. It would not have made a federal crime out of what had never been regarded as such. Yet the strong appeal for modification was rejected both out of respect for stare decisis and because of conviction that the analysis of predecessors was in- trinsically sound. In support of such soundness, special arguments advanced on behalf of the company were rejected. While the use of the mails may be essential to the business, " it is not essential to its char- acter." 39 Correspondence between the company and its agents cannot "determine anything." 40 Even if the interstate commu- nication should be wholly between the contracting parties, this " cannot make a personal contract the transportation of commodi- ties from one State to another." 41 The fact that policies are subject to sale and transfer does not matter, since " this use of them is after their creation, a use by the insured, not by the in- surer." 42 This is true of " any instrument evidencing a valuable right." 3 Exchange brokers were early held not to be engaged in commerce. " The number of transactions do [sic] not give the business any other character than magnitude." 4 Congressional power over the transportation of lottery tickets and text books does not require that the insurance cases be restricted to what is 38 " If we consider these cases numerically, the deliberation of their reasoning, and the time they cover, they constitute a formidable body of authority and strongly invoke the sanction of the rule of stare decisis. This we especially emphasize, for all of the cases concerned, as the case at bar does, the validity of state legislation, and under varying circumstances the same principle was applied in all of them. For over forty-five years they have been the legal justification for such legislation. To reverse the cases, therefore, would require us to promulgate a new rule of consti- tutional inhibition upon the States, and which would compel a change of their policy and a readjustment of their laws. Such result necessarily urges against a change of decision. In deference, however, to the earnestness of counsel, we will consider more particularly (I) what the cases decide, and (2) whether they are wrong in principle." 231 U.

Such were the main points of the opinion which were as good on June 4, 1944, as when made. Time had, however, dealt less kindly with the further point that a contrary conclusion would deprive the states of all control over insurance contracted for across state lines.46 This brings us to the consideration of other types of pecuniary transactions that have been held not to constitute commerce or at least interstate commerce so as to protect them from state control. Three instances are invoked by Mr. Justice McKenna with the introduction: " There are cognate cases to the cited cases, of contracts incident to commerce but not of themselves commerce." 47 Williams v.

Virginia and the succeeding cases were intrastate contracts while the con- tracts in the case at bar are interstate contracts. But this is a false characterization of the contracts. The decision of the cases is that contracts of insurance are not commerce at all, neither state nor interstate. This is the obstacle to the contention of the insurance company. The company realizes it to be an obstacle and has at- tempted to remove it by detailing the manner of conducting its business as demon- strating that its policies are interstate contracts. We have replied to the attempt and shown that its manner of business has no such effect. It follows necessarily, therefore, that neither the Lottery Case nor the Pigg Case impugns the authority or the application of the cited cases. They, the Lottery Case and the Pigg Case, were concerned with transactions which involved the transportation of property, and were not mere personal contracts." 23I U. S. at 510-II. 46 ," We have already pointed out that if insurance is commerce and becomes interstate commerce whenever it is between citizens of different States, then all con- trol over it is taken from the States, and the legislative regulations which this court has heretofore sustained must be declared invalid." Id. at 509. Since I913, and more strikingly in recent years, the Supreme Court has sanc- tioned an expansion of state power both regulatory and fiscal over foreign corpora- tions concededly engaged in interstate commerce. This change of decision is relied on in some detail by the brief for the Government in the South-Eastern Under- writers case under consideration. Such considerations of policy may have a bearing on the wisdom of giving constitutional sanction to a specific Congressional regulation of the interstate insurance enterprise. To give such sanction, however, it would not be necessary to overrule the old cases establishing the nature of the insur- ance contract. In any event, the currently expanding power of the states over inter- state commerce can have no bearing on what Congress meant by trade and commerce in I89o. 47 Id. at 5II. 48 I79 U.

Many were settled in other ways than by any delivery. It is not so clear that the contracts did not involve commerce as that they did not require interstate commerce. Mr. Justice McKenna's third case is Engel v.

Though clearly the agent based the objection to discrimination on the commerce clause, Mr. Chief Justice Fuller said that the point is chiefly rested on the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In condoning the discrimination he did not treat it as a commerce clause question. Obviously the determination that hiring laborers is not commerce does not mean that a tax on such hiring may not discriminate against interstate commerce. If a tax on selected local commerce with an extrastate antecedent can discriminate against inter- state commerce as in Welton v. Missouri (91 U. S. 275 (1876)), a tax on a selected noncommerce employment with extrastate consequents may be held an unconstitu- tional discrimination against interstate commerce. Cf. the condemnation of a prop- erty tax in Darnell &amp; Son v. Memphis, 208 U. S. II3 (1908), and of inspection fees in Hale v. Bimco Trading Co., 306 U. S. 375 (1939). 50 209 U.

S. 128 (1911). 53 These three cases on enterprises other than insurance here relied on by Mr. Justice McKenna had been acutely distinguished in the brief for the insurance com- pany, primarily on the ground that any interstate features were wholly collateral to the particular conduct on which the state power immediately impinged. In view of problems that may arise as to the reach of the new directions taken by the tem- porarily controlling four Justices in I944, the position of counsel for the insurance company in the Deer Lodge case may become pertinent in passing on future reper- cussions of the Underwriters defeat. After the specific and detailed differentiation the brief concludes: "Summing up these cases, it will be seen that they reinforce and indeed establish the view of the prior insurance cases for which we here contend. Where a contract though made between a corporation of one state and a citizen of another, is made in the latter and does not necessarily involve interstate negotia- tions or the transmission of anything from the one state to the other, the making of such a contract is not interstate commerce, nor is such a contract an instrument of such commerce. It is at best only 'an incident of commercial intercourse.' But when the contract results from interstate negotiations, and obligates the parties to a course of interstate dealing, including the transmission of moneys and documents</page><page sequence="16">952 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 Commerce clause objections to exercises of state power may be rejected for other reasons than that the enterprise is not com- merce. It may be held not to be interstate commerce, either be- cause it has no interstate feature or because the bite of the statute in the particular case is before or after any interstate element in the amalgam. State taxes may be sustained because their effect on interstate commerce can invoke the saving verbal grace of " in- direct." Police regulation may be condoned either because the commerce is of the type which admits of diversity of regulation or because of the servant girl's de minimis excuse that the law does not regulate commerce but merely " incidentally affects " it. Thus, we must be chary of assuming that cases sanctioning state power give secure indications that the business involved is not com- merce. This may be the reason why Mr. Justice McKenna did not invoke Hatch v. Reardon 54 which upheld a state transfer tax on the sale of corporate stock. Though in that case Mr. Justice Holmes cited Nathan v. Louisiana,55 he also clearly regarded the sale as not interstate. A corresponding reason doubtless explains Mr. Justice McKenna's omission of any mention of United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v.

Upon request these attorneys made direct reports to wholesalers and others with respect to the financial standing of persons in their respective communities. Of the work of the attorneys, Mr. Justice Pitney says: " They did not sell or offer to sell any goods, nor deliver or offer to deliver any, and had nothing to do with buying, selling, transporting, delivering, or handling any merchandise. If any commercial transaction took place between the merchant whose standing was reported and the merchant to whom the report was sent, it was due entirely to negotiations between them, with which the reporting attorney had nothing to do. Correspondence in which the Maysville attorneys furnished non-resident dealers with information was</page><page sequence="17">1944] INSURANCE AS COMMERCE 953 A similar infirmity affects two subsequent decisions sanctioning state power over the sale of securities within the state. Hall v. Geiger-Jones Co.57 refused to sanction an injunction against a state licensing law. The statute applied only to dealings in securities within the state, and the opinion states that " Upon their trans- portation into the State there is no impediment - no regulation of them or interference with them after they get there." 58 The dealers were required to secure a license, which might be revoked for cause. They also had to file a consent to be served with proc- ess. Mr. Justice McKenna posed the question as to'when choses in action after their arrival within the state would in analogy to material things lose their interstate commerce immunity, but he did not answer it. Such questions, he said, we may pass, " for regarding the securities as still in interstate commerce after their transportation to the State is ended and they have reached the hands of dealers in them, their interstate character is only inci- dentally affected by the statute." 59 He points out that even tan- gible articles would after their arrival have " no exemption from regulations the purpose of which is to prevent fraud or decep- tion." 60 While the opinion thus carefully avoids saying that the sale of securities is not commerce, it cites several of the cases in only desultory and occasional, and was not followed by the making of any contract or the transportation of any goods between the parties to the correspondence." Id. at 396-97. Later Mr. Justice Pitney adds: " In the case of commercial agencies, the thing that is laid hold of as the subject of the excise is a business carried on within the State. If it have consequences extending beyond the borders of the State, and af- fecting interstate commerce, these are only incidental and fortuitous. .. ." " In the present case it appears that there is not even systematic or continuous correspondence, much less interstate commerce resulting therefrom. There is no di- rect or necessary connection between the service performed by plaintiff in error through its representatives and the making or fulfilment of commercial contracts. . . . The circumstance that in a substantial number of cases - even if in the greater number - there is correspondence, by letter or otherwise, from State to State, which may perhaps have an effect upon the conduct of other parties about entering or not entering into transactions of interstate commerce, is not controlling." Id. at 397, 398. Mr. Justice Pitney regards the problem as novel, but distinguishes the business from that of the correspondence school and likens it to that of the cotton broker dealing in futures or options. 57 242 U.

He later wrote the meager opinion of the Court in Hemphill v. Orloff 62 which affirmed decisions below holding that a Massachusetts trust was precluded from maintaining an action in Michigan because of its failure to qualify under the Michigan statutes. The suit was one to enforce payment of a promissory note. We are told nothing about it except that it was payable to a Michigan bank or order. We are not told how the Commercial Investment Trust sold its offerings in Michigan. The statute, however, applied only to those doing a local business, and it could not at the time apply to a business exclusively interstate commerce.63 All that Mr. Justice McReynolds says on the commerce point is this: 61 The cases cited include Hatch v. Reardon, Ware &amp; Leland v. Mobile County, Engel v. O'Malley, and Broadnax v. Missouri (219 U. S. 285 (1911)). This last case sustained a conviction for disregard of a statute imposing stamp taxes on sales of stocks and commodities. The defendants were a partnership. They offered to show that "a substantial part of the sales referred to were of grain, provisions and other commodities which were at the time of sale in course of transportation as articles of interstate commerce." 219 U. S. at 295. Mr. Justice Harlan quoted from the state court the declaration that " transactions of this character have no influence whatever upon commerce between different States," and continued: "We add that the indictment deals with the place where sales, such as the statute describes, are made. The offense is complete under the statute, by the keeping of such a place, and that occurs before any question of interstate commerce could arise, so far as this record discloses."

Here a foreign corporation engaged in customhouse brokerage was denied the right to sue in the courts of the state because it had failed to take out a license to do business therein. It does not appear that the suit itself was on an interstate commerce transaction, but this is not made the basis of the decision although it is pointed out that the corporation "has localized its business, and to function effectively it must have a wide variety of dealings with the people in the community." Id. at 972. The earlier cases are shoved to one side by noting that the corporation here did not come in merely "to contribute to or to conclude a unitary interstate transaction" and that the case is not one " of the State's withholding 'the right to sue even in a single instance until the corporation renders itself amenable to suit in all the courts of the state by whosoever chooses to sue it there.'

Such business is not interstate commerce.64 For this, however, he cites Paul v. Virginia and two allies,65 and a case excluding a restraint on advertising from the grasp of the Sherman Act.66 These cases with their emphasis on the local character of the transactions may conceivably indicate a desire to leave open the question whether the sale of securities can be commerce. They do not, however, reveal any weakening of the conviction that in- surance is not commerce. A buyer of securities is a vendee. A policyholder is not a vendee but a mere promisee. The continued citation of the insurance cases amounts at least to a psychological reaffirmation of them. More direct confirmation is stamped by two other cases. In National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Wan- berg,67 though the commerce clause was not invoked, Mr. Chief Justice Taft cited the Deer Lodge case for the statement that "the business of such insurance companies is purely intra- state." 68 The decision allowed recovery for a loss by hail in re- liance on a statute requiring applications for hail insurance to be rejected within twenty-four hours if the company were to escape from liability. The application here was sent by the agent to the headquarters of the company in another state where the policy would have been issued had the application been accepted. In Bothwell v. Buckbee, Mears Co.69 a mutual insurance company was denied access to a state court in a suit for an assessment be- cause it had not complied with the laws of the state before its agent solicited the business within the state. The application and the policy crossed state lines. Mr. Justice Brandeis cited the Deer to service of process which the state required was confined to suits on causes of action arising out of business done within the state; but the statute as quoted in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinion has no such restriction. 64 277 U.

In many of these cases there were interstate features which would clearly make the transaction interstate commerce if it were commerce. If what was ordered and received were a book instead of a promise there would be an interstate sale. Thus, the re- iterated statements that the transaction is local can be accepted only because there is no sale, no vendor and vendee, and because the sending of a document does not make the sender a transporter so as to be engaged in commerce as is a carrier. That the pe- cuniary feature does not make the transaction commerce is rein- forced by Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Commis- sion 71 which allowed a state to tax gross receipts from the business of supplying longshoremen to shipowners, when the tax was condemned on receipts from doing the work of loading and unload- ing through one's own longshoremen employees. And finally the continuing constitutional character of the insurance business as not commerce, so far as state power is concerned, is certified by the recent decisions sanctioning state power over the extraterri- torial conduct of insurance companies with relation to insurance on property in the states in which they are admitted to do busi- ness.72 No corresponding license to forbid extraterritorial con- duct or to make it profitless has been accorded over corporations engaged in trade and transportation.

They do, however, establish a constitu- tional determination that the insurance business as a business is not commerce and that the fact that the business as conducted re- quires the use of interstate transportation and communication does not make it commerce. It is hard to see how such business so conducted and thus held not to be commerce as against state power can become transformed into commerce when conducted in the same way merely because the question arises under a claimed exercise of national power. It can of course become commerce by a reversal of judicial direction, but unless law is to become completely topsy-turvy the change of judgment which makes it commerce from the standpoint of one regulator should make it commerce from the standpoint of all. The dictates of reason and judgment as to the nature of the business can hardly wobble with the shift of regulation from state to nation or from nation back again to state. This of course does not mean that states and na- tion may not have different handles with which to lay hold of the same enterprise. It means only that the core of the enterprise is not changed because it may be reached by different handles. Hence the cases we have been considering are not to be lightly dismissed because the question whether insurance is trade or com- merce now arises under a federal statute rather than under one of a state. Happily in maintaining this point we are not con- fined to reliance on unofficial ratiocination. The carry over of the constitutional nature of insurance from an issue of state power to one of national power has been made by the Supreme Court itself in two unanimous decisions, both of them involving the ap- plication of the Sherman Act. Neither case involved insurance but the cases on insurance were the mainstays of both. Both cases involved business in which pecuniary considerations were at stake. Both cases involved enterprises which fed in considerable part on shipment and travel across state lines. In both cases the element of interstate transportation was the peg on which complainants sought to hang a suit under the Sherman Act. In neither case was the peg found big enough or strong enough to carry the load. Blumenstock Brothers Advertising Agency v. Curtis Publishing Co.73 was a suit for triple damages brought by a Chicago adver- tising agency against the publisher of the Saturday Evening Post 73 252 U. S. 436 (I920).</page><page sequence="22">958 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 and some other periodicals. An attempt to monopolize interstate trade and commerce was charged because the defendant refused to accept advertising except on conditions restricting the plaintiff in its patronage of rival publications. The district court was without jurisdiction unless the suit arose under the Sherman Act. The district court sustained a motion to dismiss for lack of juris- diction. The Supreme Court unanimously affirmed. The deci- sion depended on the allegations in the complaint. These were interpreted as confined to the " subject-matter " of " the making of contracts for the insertion of advertising matter in certain peri- odicals belonging to the defendant." 74 Such contracts were held not to constitute interstate commerce, even though such com- merce followed the publication of advertisements. Mr. Justice Day does not say explicitly that advertising is not commerce, but he keeps it from being interstate commerce by seg- regating it from the transportation without which the advertising could not command the prices charged. Obviously the transporta- tion of the physical magazines was much more closely integrated with what was paid for than is the transportation of policies and funds in the execution and performance of insurance contracts. These physical concomitants of insurance do not determine the amount of the premiums. What is paid for is the promise, and that alone. If the Court were too technical and artificial in saying that the circulation of the magazines does not have direct relation to the advertising contracts,75 it could not be similarly condemned 74 252 U. S. at 442. 75 Interstate circulation of periodicals and interstate transportation of physical aids to printing may bring a restraint of freedom of competition in the advertising business within the Sherman Act. Indiana Farmer's Guide Pub. Co. v. Prairie Farmer Pub. Co., 293 U. S. 268 (I934). The question whether a combination of papers to offer reduced group rates to those who advertised in all of them amounted to a forbidden restraint or monopoly was not decided. The district court had directed a verdict in favor of the defendants and this was held to be error. Mr. Justice Butler's opinion is predominantly narrative, but the correspondence school case is his first citation for his assertion on the commerce point: "The business that is here alleged to have been damaged is the publication and circulation of these farm papers. That business includes the obtaining of advertising, the trans- portation between States of electrotypes, sent respectively to petitioner and respond- ents by their customers to be used in setting up advertisements, and the transporta- tion of substantial quantities of the papers in interstate commerce. Advertising at compensatory rates is an essential element. The opinion in Blumenstock Bros. v. Curtis Publishing Co., supra, assumed that a publishing business such as that now</page><page sequence="23">1944] INSURANCE AS COMMERCE 959 for minimizing and disjoining the communication and transporta- tion adjuncts of the making of contracts of indemnity across state lines. Therefore, the Blumenstock case in holding these adver- tising contracts not within the Sherman Act would from the stand- point of practical judgment be a precedent for excluding the mobile accessories of the insurance business from any weight in deter- mining whether such business can as a business become interstate commerce when the contracts are not commerce at all. The relationship between this Sherman Act determination and the cases on state power which have held insurance and other en- terprises not to be commerce is not left to mere surmising. Mr. Justice Day distinguishes the correspondence school case " wherein there was a continuous interstate traffic in text books and appara- tus ... ." 76 He puts the advertising case before him " within that line of cases in which we have held that policies of insurance are not articles of commerce, and that the making of such contracts is a mere incident of commercial intercourse." 77 He cites the lead- ing insurance cases and invokes more at length the rulings on emi- grant agents, brokers of cotton futures, and a credit reporting agency. He notes that the credit case disregarded the relation of the credit information to interstate trade. Such relation is closer than that of most if not of all insurance. In conclusion Mr. Justice Day puts the cases on state power in the same pocket with the Sherman Act issue when he says: Applying the principles of these cases, it is abundantly established that there is no ground for claiming that the transactions which are the basis of the present suit, concerning advertising in journals to be subsequently distributed in interstate commerce, are contracts which directly affect such commerce. Their incidental relation thereto cannot lay the ground- work for such contentions as are undertaken to be here maintained under ? 7 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. . . 78 under consideration would amount to interstate commerce. There is no ground for the contention that the evidence in this case is not sufficient to go to the jury on the question of interstate commerce. . . ." 293 U. S. at 276. After the remand there was a trial in the district court and the plaintiffs got a verdict. This was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals under the impression that affirmance was required by the previous Supreme Court decree. The Supreme Court, however, in Prairie Farmer Pub. Co. v.

A newly organized Federal League of baseball clubs found rough going because the older leagues had their players tied so they were not free agents until released. As a result of this and other action by the older leagues, only one club of the new Federal League remained. This lonely survivor with no one to play with sued the older leagues under the Sherman Act and got a verdict. The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia reversed, and the reversal was sustained by the United States Supreme Court in Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore v. National League of Pro- fessional Baseball Clubs.79 The injured plaintiff relied on the " constantly repeated travelling on the part of the clubs, which is provided for, controlled and disciplined by the organizations," 80 but Mr. Justice Holmes answered: The business is giving exhibitions of base ball, which are purely state affairs. It is true that, in order to attain for these exhibitions the great popularity that they have achieved, competitions must be arranged be- tween clubs from different cities and States. But the fact that in order to give the exhibitions the Leagues must induce free persons to cross state lines and must arrange and pay for their doing so is not enough to change the character of the business. According to the distinction in- sisted upon in Hooper v. California, I55 U. S. 648, 655, the transport is a mere incident, not the essential thing. That to which it is incident, the exhibition, although made for money would not be called trade or commerce in the commonly accepted use of those words. As it is put by the defendants, personal effort, not related to production, is not a sub- ject of commerce. That which in its consummation is not commerce does not become commerce among the States because the transportation that we have mentioned takes place. To repeat the illustrations given by the Court below, a firm of lawyers sending out a member to argue a case, or the Chautauqua lecture bureau sending out lecturers, does not engage in such commerce because the lawyer or lecturer goes to another State.81 Such wine needs no bush, except to remind the reader that the Hooper case here relied on belongs to the insurance family. These two cases on advertising and baseball contracts are not shaken by any later decisions prior to the South-Eastern Underwriters case.

Combinations of bill posters are concerned with physical things which cross state lines even though their acts of restraint impinge primarily on subsequent posting.82 Motion pic- ture producers ship their films across state lines to be used as physical objects.83 A theatrical agent is entitled to be heard when contracts call for interstate travel by performers and for interstate transportation of their stage properties.84 Such cases do not make the insurance business anything like running a circus. Even if the Court had before 1944 seen more clearly the significance of ship- ping physical objects for affixation or exhibition than it did in the baseball case and the first advertising case and had found the re- straints complained of to be directly related to such shipping, this did not shade in any way the judicial conception of the nature of the insurance business or the recognition that its nature is the same from the standpoint of the Sherman Act as from that of state power. Before closing this Sherman Act survey, mention should be made of a point in Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange 85 which reinforces the warning against taking cases on transportation as fully applicable to other activities. Here a cotton exchange which declined to furnish quotations to an organization which had suc- ceeded another which had been convicted of conducting a bucket shop was sued along with two telegraph companies in an action 82 Charles A. Ramsay Co. v. Associated Bill Posters, 260 U. S. 50I (I923); C. E. Stevens Co. v. Foster &amp; Kleiser Co., 3II U. S. 255 (I940). 83 Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, 263 U.

S. 208 (I939). 84 Hart v. B. F. Keith Vaudeville Exchange, 262 U. S. 271 (1923). The question in the case was whether the district court had jurisdiction under the Sherman Act. The district court was reversed for dismissing the bill. How little the case really decides is evident from the concluding sentences of Mr. Justice Holmes's opinion: "It is enough that we are not prepared to say that nothing can be extracted from this bill that falls under the act of Congress, or at least that the claim is wholly frivolous. The bill was brought before the decision of the Base Ball Club Case, and it may be that what in general is incidental, in some instances may rise to a magni- tude that requires it to be considered independently. The logic of the general rule as to jurisdiction is obvious and the case should be decided upon the merits unless the want of jurisdiction is entirely clear. What relief, if any, could be given and how far it could go it is not yet time to discuss." Id. at 274. 85 270 U.

The business of the cotton exchange was wholly local so far as the cotton transactions between its mem- bers were concerned. The exchange, however, had contracts with telegraph companies which paid it for the privilege of receiving and distributing the quotations to persons approved by the ex- change. This was held not enough to put the exchange into inter- state commerce.86 The parallel between giving the quotations to the telegraph companies to transmit and giving to the post office communications about insurance policies and premiums would seem to be too straight and close to permit any respecter of estab- lished judicial analysis to turn the insurance business into com- merce merely because it avails itself of the carrying facilities of commerce. III As was recognized at the outset, full acceptance of the long certi- fied conclusion that the insurance business is not commerce even when conducted across state lines does not mean that Congress has no power over insurance. It has never been doubted that Con- gress has many other constitutional leverages than the one em- bodied in the Sherman Act. Since transportation is commerce, Congress with power over interstate transportation may regulate many matters associated with such transportation or dependent upon it although they are not transportation itself. The idea that the national regulation of transportation must be in aid of trans- portation or of matters associated with transportation, although it has had occasional outcroppings 87 has never enjoyed sturdy growth, and in practice has been rejected by many cases sanction- 86 ", It is equally clear that the contract with the Western Union for the distribu- tion of the quotations to such persons as the New York exchange shall approve does not fall within the reach of the Anti-Trust Act. Under that contract, the exchange at its own expense collects the quotations and delivers them to the telegraph com- pany for distribution to such approved persons. The real distributor is the exchange; the telegraph company is an agency through which the distribution is made. In effect, the exchange hands over the quotations, as it might any other message, to the telegraph company for transmission, charges to be collected from the receivers. The payment which the telegraph company makes to the exchange is for the privilege of having the business. It does not alter the character of the service rendered." 270 U.

Lottery tickets are harmless physical objects. They do no harm while in transit. They do no harm afterwards if left alone. Such harm as is conceived to ensue after their arrival is due to the excitement induced by their allure or to the loss of what is paid for them. What was once thought a worthy way of raising funds to build a college dormitory is now in some quarters found to be tainted with vice. The ticket attracts the cupidity of those who may yearn for multum ex parvo. Hard-earned or easy-earned dollars may be spent without other return than the short-lived joy of anticipation. Worse than this, the conductors of a lottery may be less worthy and less scrupulous than was Harvard College in seeking and securing the wherewithal to build Holworthy. Against fraud and chicanery in fixing the ratio between intake and outgo and in drawing the lucky numbers, patrons in partibus infidelium lack the protection and remedy both of self-help and of effective assistance from the state of their allegiance. Hence Congress stepped into the breach and forbade the interstate transportation of the offending ministers of evil. A lottery ticket is a promise to pay on a contingency. So is an insurance policy. The contingencies are likely to differ in aleatory intensity and scope, except perhaps in the case of some policies issued by Lloyds. So when The Lottery Case 89 after much trepi- dation sustained the power of Congress over the interstate trans- portation of lottery tickets, there seemed good reason to assume that Congress might exercise a like power over insurance policies if it kept within the limits of due process of law. Of course there are differences. The purchase of a guarantee against a loss is more meritorious than parting with pennies in hope of winning pounds. In some kinds of policies, there is return in the nature of investment. Where the contingency of the insurance policy is completely uncertain, there is among the honorable a preference to lose the bet, and the bet itself has a value exceeding the stake laid down. This is enough to raise what formerly at least would have 88 See Cushman, The National Police Power under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution (1919) 3 MINN. L. REV. 289, 381, 452. 89 Champion v. Ames, i88 U. S. 321 (I903).</page><page sequence="28">964 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 been an insurmountable due process obstacle against an unquali- fied ban on the migration of all insurance policies. Some insurance policies, however, may have due process infirmities at least equal to those of filled milk.90 They may not be always what they seem or promise, any more than food "9 or drugs.92 And so why should not Congress have power to forbid the interstate transportation of what would be judicially accredited as noxious policies? The question has never been explicitly answered by officialdom because the other officialdom which could ask it has never both- ered to do so. Hence unofficial answers must be groped for by invocation of analogies. When Congress forbids transportation, it may give its orders to those who instigate it 93 and to those who accept delivery,94 as well as to the bearers, even though neither sender nor receiver is himself engaged in commerce. Mailers of letters are not participants in the postal function, but their prompt- ing of the service must conform to approved standards of recti- tude.5 An insurance policy, like a lottery ticket, is a material object. The differences relate to the incorporation of the promise in the paper and so to transferability, and to the contingencies of the promise. Would these differences make a difference? It is hard to see why they should if due process ideals are duly re- spected, unless in some way the regulation of the transmission of the policy is an invasion of the reserved powers of the states though the ban on lottery tickets is not. This possibility would at one time have required differentiation of the first Child Labor Case.9 From considerations of effective administration, the child labor statute put its ban on transporta- tion from factories in which children under designated ages are employed, without requiring proof of juvenile contribution to the making of the particular articles emigrating. The decision would not have been different if the nexus between child and product 90 United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144 (1938). 91 Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, 220 U.

Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251 (I918).</page><page sequence="29">1944] INSURANCE AS COMMERCE 965 had to be duly established. The basic reason of the Supreme Court's condemnation was its persuasion that the statute was an invasion of the reserved power of the state of manufacture to choose whether to condemn or to condone the employment of chil- dren in local occupations. The decision was hard to accept at the time. States of destination could not impose an embargo, for this would be a regulation of interstate commerce. Why is not an em- bargo decreed by Congress a regulation of interstate commerce? The answer was in effect that Congress was not really regulating the transportation but was controlling the anterior process of man- ufacture. Shoes made by children were distinguished from liquor and lottery tickets because they are harmless. This could not have meant that child labor can claim due process sanction under the Fourteenth Amendment, and there was no invocation of the Fifth Amendment as a guardian of the transportation. In the light of earlier cases, the distinction's only possible pertinence to the commerce issue must have been that the harm of child labor is over before transportation ensues and that therefore Congress was not protecting the states of destination from evil. Such a judgment, if warranted on the basis of fact, was enough to differentiate the cases on liquor and lottery tickets. It partly differentiated the sanction of the White Slave Act,97 though in large measure that statute was concerned with the evil of abduction in states of origin. There remains the question whether the judg- ment was warranted. It was argued in favor of the statute that the influx of goods made under inferior labor standards can cause injury to states with higher standards. Mr. Justice Day, however, dismissed such competitive considerations with the curt answer that the commerce power does not give Congress authority to equalize the conditions of production in the different states. This was in I9I8, and much judicial ink has flowed under the bridge since then. At the time, however, the economic infection of sub- standard conditions was not recognized as a warrant for national prophylaxis. It is doubtless true, too, that the dominant effort be- hind the child labor statute was the humanitarian one of stopping the evil of child labor at its source, but motive is not supposed to afford a test of constitutionality. When Mr. Justice Day argued 97 36 STAT. 825 (1910), i8 U. S. C. ? 398 (I940). Hoke v. United States, 227 U. S. 308 (I913).</page><page sequence="30">966 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 that the transportation was not the cause of the harm, he confined himself to physical causality and neglected the fact that without access to an extrastate market there would not be manufacture for that market. The Child Labor Case with all its frailties could nevertheless be accepted at face value without finding it a precedent against a Congressional ban on the interstate transportation of insurance policies. The harm that policies may induce is not over when they quit the home office. It has hardly begun. Economic infection in a single policy can reach into a more distant and repetitive future than can the lottery tickets of any given gamble. In neither time nor space is it confined to the date or place of initiation. If in I918 a state had no reserved power to project food and lottery tickets and intoxicants beyond its borders, it could hardly have had such power to scatter undesirable documents across a continent. Their possible evil at any rate is not ended when they are written. It flourishes predominantly in the areas of receipt and deposit. The principle invoked in the Child Labor Case can be fully approved even though it was there misapplied. Congress should not be able to use its power over transportation to suppress evils in no way related to or dependent upon it. Sanction of such use would mean the end of constitutional federalism. No such issue would be raised by Congressional regulation of the conduct of the insurance business across state lines. Power to keep pernicious policies in their home state would not mean that Congress might condition embargoes on antecedent behavior that has no push in time or space beyond its initial moment and spot of occurrence.98 98 For elaboration of this assertion, see Powell, Child Labor, Congress, and the Constitution (1922) I N. C. L. REV. 61, 63-64: "No one would have the hardi- hood to argue in favor of the constitutionality of congressional prohibition of inter- state transportation of all goods from states in which divorce is allowed or of all persons who beat their wives. Such interdictions of interstate transit would brow- beat the states not to permit divorce and browbeat husbands not to browbeat their wives. They would wield the commerce power as a club to control local enterprises in no way dependent upon interstate commerce. Intra-marital pugilism would be dissuaded, not because belligerent husbands need interstate commerce for the achieve- ment of this particular aim, but because for other reasons they are sufficiently eager for interstate wanderings to be willing to comply with the independent and unrelated condition which Congress selects as the criterion whether such wanderings may take place. This would partake of the nature of brigandage or blackmail. There would be no appropriate connection between the transportation and the conduct which makes it licit or illicit. Such a supposed statute should rightly be held to transcend</page><page sequence="31">1944] INSURANCE AS COMMERCE 967 These contentions might have claimed sufficient compulsion in 1918 and thereafter to warrant Congressional efforts to deal with interstate insurance if there were any impulse to do so. Of course, however strong the intellectual compulsions, it cannot be asserted with confidence that the Supreme Court before the new dispensa- tion would have sanctioned a ban on the exit of delusive and ex- travagant policies on the analogy of wholly pernicious lottery tickets, though the dominant judicial hostility to regulation in that era might have preferred one master to forty-eight. Neither can it be known whether a majority, even if it would have gone this far, would have sanctioned conditions on the licitness of transpor- tation that go beyond solvency and arrangements of fairly direct financial concern to promisees and embrace regard for a fair field for competitors and for freedom of brokers and agents to parcel out their proposals as they prefer. The ascertainment of what was constitutional law on any particular point at any given time when it was nonexistent is a speculative enterprise too hazardous to appeal to observers of the vagaries of judicial behavior. The time has passed when the issues of the nineteen twenties are acute. We know now that the Child Labor Case has been interred along with many later companions that took similar restricted views of the scope of national power."" We know that recently Congress has been discovered to be endowed with a commerce power not only to attach conditions to interstate transportation but to im- pose direct prescriptions upon conduct which, though not com- merce, somewhat affects interstate commerce and is somewhat af- the commerce power because of its intended and necessary effect on matters to which interstate transportation has no necessary relation." No such restriction of the commerce power would be inferred from the part of Mr. Justice Holmes's dissent in which he says: " If there were no Constitution and no Congress their power to cross the line would depend upon their neighbors. Under the Constitution such commerce belongs not to the States but to Congress to regulate. It may carry out its views of public policy whatever indirect effect they may have upon the activities of the States." 247 U. S. at 281. In Mr. Justice Stone's opinion in United States v. Darby (312 U. S. IOO, II5 (I94I)) there is a reference to " the powerful and now classic dissent of Mr. Justice Holmes setting forth the fundamental issues involved . . . ." Notwithstanding this seemingly unqualified approval, there is no warrant in Supreme Court decisions as yet for a view that Congress could put an embargo on exit of persons or property from a state conditioned on local conduct or local laws that have no relation to or dependence upon interstate commerce. 99 United States v.

So tolerant is now the judicial referee that Congress may grapple with any local entrants into interstate competition with apparently almost no holds barred. It would be superfluous to review these recent judicial dispensa- tions in any detail. The Justices who dissent in the South-Eastern Underwriters case agree that Congress has now been accorded ample power to deal with the financial and competitive features of the far-flung insurance enterprise by any clear and direct pre- scriptions that may be applied to other noncommerce undertakings that feed on and are fed by interstate commerce. All Congress has to do is to wield its accredited legislative power. This, however, is a very different thing from the judicial wielding of unaccredited legislative power by a minority, or even by a majority, of a full judicial bench in the face of frequent professions of the judicial duty to follow rather than to lead or to obstruct. When courts refashion legislation to make it conform to judicial views of de- sirable scope and policy, the offense is less serious than when they use those views to veto legislation. Such refashioning, however, may still be an offense against the tripartite division of powers. It may be the product of a wilfulness and a self-assurance that psychologically are not wholly alien to the instinct to rule that was thought in some quarters to be a factor in the imposition of the judicial negatives that antedated the constitutional crisis over judicial power a few years ago. When Congress has wished to push its commerce power beyond the confines of what is interstate commerce or what is commerce, it has known very well how to do so. It can hardly be doubted that its expansive phrases in recent statutes have been conceived with awareness of the long established constitutional line between en- terprises that are commerce and those that are not. Congress learned long ago from the Shreveport case 100 that the relation be- tween interstate and local commerce is, "as a relation," within the national commerce power. It applied this knowledge in the Transportation Act 101 and defined the relationship more widely than that between particular competing localities.102 More re- 100 Houston, East &amp; West Texas Ry. v.

The quotation is from the opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Taft in United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., 259 U. S. 344, 408 (1922). Mr. Charles E. Hughes argued the case for the winning Mine Workers. He had earlier been the losing counsel in United States v. Ferger, 250 U. S. 199 (1919), which sustained a conviction under a federal statute for issuing a forged interstate bill of lading. His former associates, with the exception of Mr. Justice Pitney, did not accept his contention that since the bill of lading was forged, there was no inter- state commerce and therefore no national power over what Mr. Ferger had done. These cases and expressions were clear indications that Congress had not exhausted its power by the Sherman Act and that it was not confined to the established doc- trinal divisions which had been laid down in the cases on state power and on the Sherman Act. 108 49 STAT. 449 (1935), 29 U.

Section 3(b) defines "com- merce " as " trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several States or from any State to any place outside thereof." Ibid., 29 U. S.

This is preceded by section 2(a) containing the following declaratory findings: " The Congress hereby finds that the existence, in industries engaged in com- merce or in the production of goods for commerce, of labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers (i) causes commerce and the channels and instru- mentalities of commerce to be used to spread and perpetuate such labor conditions among the workers of the several States; (2) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; (3) constitutes an unfair method of competition in commerce; (4) leads to labor disputes burdening and obstructing commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; and (5) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods in commerce."

In the Darby case Mr. Justice Stone said: " Congress was not unaware that most manufacturing businesses shipping their product in interstate commerce make it in their shops without refer- ence to its ultimate destination and then after manufacture select some of it for ship- ment interstate and some intrastate according to the daily demands of their business, and that it would be practically impossible, without disrupting manufacturing busi- nesses, to restrict the prohibited kind of production to the particular pieces of lumber,</page><page sequence="35">1944] INSURANCE AS COMMERCE 971 After Congress was foiled in its plan of using its spending power to bribe farmers to restrict their planting,ll3 it sought a similar inflation of the prices of agricultural products by using the com- merce power to control what it called marketing. The Agricul- tural Adjustment Act of 1938 114 provided for quotas and for ap- portionment among individual growers. It imposed penalties for marketing in excess of the quota. The application of the statute to tobacco was sustained in Mulford v. Smith 115 where Mr. Justice Roberts said that it " does not purport to control production." 116 The verbal and doctrinal caution in this and other expressions in the opinion was thrown to the winds by Mr. Justice Jackson in Wickard v. Filburn.17 This sanctioned the imposition of a pen- alty on a farmer who fed his livestock on the farm with wheat grown in excess of his allotted quota. After this opinion for a unanimous court, there could be no doubt that Congress may cloth, furniture or the like which later move in interstate rather than intrastate commerce. Cf. United States v. New York C. R. Co. 272 U. S. 457, 460." " The recognized need of drafting a workable statute and the well known circum- stances in which it was to be applied are persuasive of the conclusion, which the legis- lative history supports, . . . that the 'production for commerce' intended in- cludes at least production of goods, which, at the time of production, the employer, according to the normal course of his business, intends or expects to move in inter- state commerce although, through the exigencies of the business, all of the goods may not thereafter actually enter interstate commerce." 312 U.

It sets no limit upon the acreage which may be planted or produced and imposes no penalty for the plant- ing and producing of tobacco in excess of the marketing quota. It purports to be solely a regulation of interstate commerce, which it reaches and affects at the throat where tobacco enters the stream of commerce,-the marketing warehouse." Id. at 47. 117 317 U.

"Whether the subject of the regulation in question was 'production,' 'consumption,' or 'marketing' is, therefore, not material for pur- poses of deciding the question of federal power before us. That an activity is of local character may help in a doubtful case to determine whether Congress intended to reach it. The same consideration might help in determining whether in the ab- sence of Congressional action it would be permissible for the state to exert its power on the subject matter, even though in so doing it to some degree affected interstate commerce. But even if appellee's activity be local and though it may not be re- garded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce, and this irrespective of whether such effect is what might at some earlier time have been defined as ' direct' or 'indirect."'

When Congress has desired to do so, it has been at pains to make clear that such is its design. It thereby leaves the courts free to confine themselves to their proper function without reading new meanings into a venerable Constitution and a fairly mature statute. "Affecting commerce" makes a considerably bigger dragnet than " production for commerce." Whether it is a wise legisla- tive method to use a phrase that leaves so much latitude for judg- ment as this, may be open to question. Obviously Congress wanted to spread freedom from employer interference with employee or- ganization as far as the Supreme Court would sanction. Some of the decisions confirming the Labor Board's assumption of juris- diction have seemed somewhat farfetched when looked at solely from the standpoint of the business of the particular employer.ll8 118 In NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 3I0 U. S. I (I937), which was the initial decision sustaining and applying the statute, Mr. Chief Justice Hughes empha- sized the far-flung nature of the Jones &amp; Laughlin business and said: " When indus- tries organize themselves on a national scale, making their relation to interstate com- merce the dominant factor in their activities, how can it be maintained that their industrial labor relations constitute a forbidden field into which Congress may not enter when it is necessary to protect interstate commerce from the paralyzing conse- quences of industrial war? " Id. at 41. In applying the Act in the same opinion to a relatively small and localized clothing manufacturer the Chief Justice relied mainly on the fact that the findings of the Board were supported by evidence. He referred to the findings of the Board including a summary of the organization of the Amalga- mated Clothing Workers, to the industrial strife in New York before they secured their collective bargaining arrangements with manufacturers there, and to the rela- tive peace which followed afterwards. This may be taken as a vague suggestion that one factor in the effect on commerce of a dispute in a local plant is the relation between the particular employees and a more or less national union. In NLRB v. Hearst Publications, 322 U. S. III (1944), the Board was sustained in applying the act to news vendors of a Los Angeles paper who contractually were vendees of the paper and vendors to customers in Los Angeles and its suburbs. In holding such contractors to be "employees," Mr. Justice Rutledge relied on the degree of control exercised over them by those clearly employees of the newspaper and invoked the fact that Congress " sought to find a broad solution, one that would bring industrial peace by substituting, so far as its power could reach, the rights of workers to self organization and collective bargaining for the industrial strife where these rights are not effectively established." Id. at 125. Apparently the employer did not see fit to contend that the activity of these vendors in Los Angeles did not "affect " interstate commerce. Their enterprise was clearly commerce whether they were middlemen or agents, but all interstate commerce so far as they were concerned was over and done with after the printing of the journals and before they got them. The journals did not come from another state.

This is that when Labor with a capital L is organized in national unions, the interwoven chords of mutual interest and sympathy may expand a tiny squabble into a widespread walkout."9 To make this an explicit basis of coverage would excite emotions in some quarters which have not been overstimulated to happiness by recent legislative and judicial trends. Into this, there is no occasion for probing here. It is mentioned at the moment only because something analogous may have a more unquestionable bearing on what should be taken into consideration if Congress should undertake to deal deliberately and in detail with the far- flung financial activities of insurance companies. Obviously many of these activities far transcend in scope and intricacy the situations with which the common law dealt under the concept of restraint of trade. Whether the adoption by the Sherman Act of the common-law locution has turned out to be desirable, is itself open to question. The judicial wanderings on restraint and on attempts to monopolize could hardly have been foreseen by Senators Edmunds and Sherman and their colleagues. seem to have been confined to news and supplies. Thus, these street vendors had a very different relationship to the newspaper enterprise than that of the rewrite editor in issue in Associated Press v. NLRB (301 U. S. I03 (I937)). The counsel for the Hearst Publications were doubtless justified, however, in assuming that the Court would not draw a distinction between the different types of work of employees of an employer who is determined to be engaged in interstate commerce. Cessation of selling may of course reduce printing and the interstate receipt of news to be printed. In applying the Wages and Hours Act the Supreme Court has also been far from niggardly. Kirschbaum Co, v. Walling (316 U. S. 517 (1942)) sanctioned inclusion of an elevator operator in a loft building occupied largely by producers who ship in interstate commerce. The decision invoked section 3(j) which provides that " for the purpose of this Act an employee shall be deemed to have been engaged in the production of goods if such employee was employed . . . in any process or occu- pation necessary to the production thereof .... ." Id. at 5i8. In bringing the ele- vator operator within the statute, Mr. Justice Frankfurter relied on the statute itself and not on the full scope of constitutional power. He made the point that "The history of the legislation leaves no doubt that Congress chose not to enter areas which it might have occupied." Id. at 522. For this he invoked a comparison be- tween cases under the Sherman Act and others under the Wagner Act. Perhaps the most expansive decision thus far is Warren-Bradshaw Drilling Co. v. Hall (317 U. S. 88 (1942)), which sanctioned the application of the Wages and Hours Act to employees of an independent contractor drilling oil wells. 119 See note ii8 supra.</page><page sequence="38">974 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 While it has been judicially certified that the statute is not more than permissibly indefinite,120 the certification is about the only basis for assurance of even moderate clarity. Only the most doc- trinaire believers that what ultimately eventuates was in gremio legis from the beginning would posit prophetic certainty in prac- tical administration. The procedures for enforcing and applying the Sherman Act do not help to certify the legal quality of conduct before it occurs, even though the injunction and attendant consent decrees may permit reformation without serious penalties for ret- roactively discovered delinquencies. How the private action for triple damages would work out in suits by policyholders, agents, and competing companies, as compared with its operation in suits between rival industrialists and between vendors and vendees or would-be vendees, must be problematical. The financial inter- relations and permutations and combinations associated with the insurance enterprise are much more complex than anything here- tofore brought under the Sherman Act. This offers support for Congressional action while it shows that such action should be quite different from what was Congressionally conceived in I890. This returns us to the observation about the bearing of em- ployee interrelations upon an analogous element in the insurance business. National organization of labor unions prevents insula- tion of particular disputes. The permeating radiations of finance mean interrelations wider and more crisscrossing than those merely between a policyholder and an insurer, between different policy- holders, or between agents and brokers on the one hand and the promisors of indemnity obligations on the other. If all this makes the analogy of labor relations relevant to the present-day enter- prise of insurance and investment and finance from the standpoint of national power, it also makes most pertinent to the insurance problem the analogy of the type of administration adopted by the Wagner Act. In the enforcement of that statute there are ad- ministrative hearings and orders which are preliminaries to judi- cial consideration and decree. Though the Wagner Act would not in all respects be a perfect model for national control of insurance, its procedural devices are much superior to those of the Sherman Act. Regulation of financial complications should, however, offer 120 Nash v. United States, 229 U. S. 373 (I913).</page><page sequence="39">1944] INSURANCE AS COMMERCE 975 statutory prescriptions much more definite and detailed than any in the Wagner Act even though there are provisions for further administrative clarification and specification. So far as the application of the Wagner Act to insurance com- panies is concerned, this is established by the unanimous decision in Polish National Alliance v. National Labor Relations Board 121 handed down on the same day as the South-Eastern Underwriters case. Thus there must have been full knowledge in conference that insurance did not have to be metamorphosed constitutionally in order to lay a foundation for national regulation. Of course the unanimity in the Polish Alliance case did not extend to the reasons for the decision. Three of the four determining Justices of the South-Eastern Underwriters case applied the Wagner Act on the ground that the insurance business is itself interstate commerce when operated across state lines. The concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Black makes the point that the Labor Board had gone on that ground and had made no finding confined to a conclusion " that petitioner's insurance activities merely affected commerce in types of interstate business other than its own." 122 On the basis of this it was somewhat vaguely hinted that the broader ground was the only one on which judicial approval could be based.123 It is not, however, to be assumed that this would have led to a dissent if there could not have been invocation of the four-powered decree in the simultaneous South-Eastern Under- writers case. The technical issue of review of the Labor Board need not poignantly concern us. Without giving a citation, Mr. Justice Frankfurter quoted the Board as finding that " petitioner's prac- tices 'have a close, intimate, and substantial relation to trade, traffic, and commerce among the several States and tend to lead to labor disputes burdening and obstructing commerce.' 124 Mr. Justice Black does not say the contrary. He pins his separate 121 64 Sup. Ct. 1196 (June 5, I944). Mr. Justice Roberts did not sit. 122 Id. at I200. 123 Mr. Justice Black's opinion begins as follows: " The National Labor Relations Act does not vest courts with power to review the evidence presented to the Labor Board and make independent findings of fact. 29 U. S. C. ? i6o(e), 29 U. S. C. A. ? i6o(e). Therefore the propriety of the Board's order in this case must be con- sidered on the basis of the facts the Board found." Ibid. 124 Id. at II98.</page><page sequence="40">976 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 basis of concurrence on the fact that the Board did not take evi- dence or make a finding on the effect of insurance on other busi- ness. So far as conclusions went, the Board appears to have used a double-barreled gun. Our concern is with the shot which the opinion of the Court spotted on the target. This and the avowals by dissenters in the South-Eastern Underwriters case settle that Congress may regulate the interstate financial relations of insur- ance companies as it may regulate their labor relations. Indeed, the financial empire was invoked as one of the reasons for the effect on commerce of the labor relations of an insurance com- pany.125 We may readily agree that the spreading words of the statute and the practicalities of the insurance enterprise amply justified the Board and the judicial approval of its action. This, however, does not coerce concurrence in a suggestion that Con- gress had the insurance enterprise clearly in mind.'26 When if ever it does mean to regulate the financial and competitive aspects of the enterprise, it is to be hoped that it will say so explicitly and will prescribe its distinctions between lawful and unlawful be- havior with as much particularity as it can reasonably muster. 125 " This summary of the activities of Alliance and of the methods and facilities for their pursuit amply shows the web of money-making transactions woven across many State lines. An effective strike against such a business enterprise, centered in Chicago but radiating from it all over the country, would as a practical matter cer- tainly burden and obstruct the means of transmission and communication across these state lines. Stoppage or disruption of the work in Chicago involves interrup- tions in the steady stream, into and out of Illinois, of bills, notices, and policies, the payments of commissions, the making of loans on policies, the insertion and circula- tion of advertising material in newspapers, and its dissemination over the radio. The effect of such interruptions on commerce is unmistakable. The load of inter- state communication and transportation services is lessened, cash necessary for in- terstate business becomes unavailable, the business, interstate, of newspapers and radio stations suffer. Nor is this all. Alliance, it appears, plays a credit role in inter- state industries, railroads, and other public utilities. In 1941, it acquired securities in an amount in excess of $II,ooo,ooo, and sold or redeemed securities costing more than $7,500,000. Financial transactions of this magnitude cannot be impeded even tem- porarily without affecting to an extent not negligible the interstate enterprises in which the large assets of Alliance are invested." 64 Sup. Ct. at 1198. 126 " To hold that Congress could not deem the activities here in question to affect what men of practical affairs would call commerce, and to deem them related to such commerce merely by gossamer threads and not by solid ties, would be to dis- respect the judgment that is open to men who have the constitutional power and responsibility to legislate for the Nation."

Many of the acts charged, quite aside from rate agreements, were obvious restraints of competition and an attempt to monopolize."'7 Mr. Justice Black, in what is called the opinion of the Court, says without denial by dissenters that "Appellees have not argued other- wise." 128 The district court sustained a demurrer to the indict- ment.129 The Government went straight to the Supreme Court under the Criminal Appeals Act.l30 The three who join with Mr. Justice Black are Justices Douglas, Murphy, and Rutledge.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter joins briefly with the Chief Justice.'13 Mr. Justice Jackson takes a somewhat dif- ferent line and presents his views in a form resembling that of an 127 " The conspirators not only fixed premium rates and agents' commissions, but employed boycotts together with other types of coercion and intimidation to force non-member insurance companies into the conspiracies, and to compel persons who needed insurance to buy only from S. E. U. A. members on S. E. U. A. terms. Companies not members of the S. E. U. A. were cut off from the opportunity to reinsure their risks, and their services and facilities were disparaged; independent sales agencies who defiantly represented non-S. E. U. A. companies were punished by a withdrawal of the right to represent the members of S. E. U. A.; and persons needing insurance who purchased from non-S. E. U. A. companies were threatened with boycotts and withdrawal of all patronage. The two conspiracies were effec- tively policed by inspection and rating bureaus in five of the six states, together with local boards of insurance agents in certain cities of all six states." 64 Sup.

C. ? 682 (Supp. 1942). 131 Mr. Justice Frankfurter's full opinion is as follows: "I join in the opinion of the CHIEF JUSTICE." " The relations of the insurance business to national commerce and finance, I have no doubt, afford constitutional authority for appropriate regulation by Congress of the business of insurance, certainly not to a less extent than Congressional regulation touching agriculture. See, e.g., Smith v. Kansas City Title &amp; Trust Co., 255 U. S. i80, 41 S.Ct. 243, 65 L.Ed. 577; Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. III, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122. But the opinion of the CHIEF JUSTICE leaves me equally without doubt that by the enactment of the Sherman Act in I890, . . . Congress did not mean to disregard the then accepted conception of the constitutional basis for the regulation of the insurance business. And the evidence is overwhelming that the inapplicability of the Sherman Act, in its contemporaneous setting, to insurance transactions such as those charged by this indictment has been confirmed and not modified by Con- gressional attitude and action in the intervening fifty years. There is no Congressional</page><page sequence="42">978 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 independent essay. Since he obviously would not fully sustain the demurrer to the indictment, he is announced by the reporter as " dissenting in part." So he is, in ideas, both from the majority and from the Chief Justice. The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Black have a difference of opinion as to what is before the Court under the restrictions of the Criminal Appeals Act. The controversy is somewhat involved and it is not certain that the opposing gears completely mesh. Mr. Justice Black does not indicate disagreement with the state- ment of the Chief Justice that under the Criminal Appeals Act " the only questions open for decision here are whether the Dis- trict Court's constructions of the commerce clause and of the Sherman Act, on which it rested its decision, are the correct ones." 132 He insists, however, that the indictment applied to and that the district court passed upon " the total 'activities com- plained of as constituting the business of insurance'," 13 including " not only the execution of insurance contracts but also negotia- tions and events prior to execution of the contracts and the innu- merable transactions necessary to performance of the con- tracts." 134 He twice guards against any notion that nothing was involved but the making of " local" contracts, and he rejects an argument " suggested in this Court" that " the indictment charges nothing more than restraint and monopoly in the ' mere formation of an insurance contract'." 135 One interpretation of the effort here might be that Mr. Justice Black is merely wishing to insist that the interstate features of the insurance business are clearly involved, and thus to get away from the old notion that an insurance contract is a local transac- tion though negotiations and shipment straddle state lines. The Chief Justice, however, who was in a preferred position to know, evidently thinks that something more was intended. He quotes the district court to the effect that " It is not a question here of whether the defendants participated in some incidental way in interstate commerce or used in some instances the facilities of in- terstate commerce, but is rather whether the activities complained warrant therefore for bringing about the far-reaching dislocations which the opinions of the CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice JACKSON adumbrate." 64 Sup.

It is not so clear that Mr. Justice Black is doing this when he is concerned with the indictment as when later he parades all the interstate features while turning the insurance business into commerce. At any rate at this point he does not seem to be regarding the insurance companies as carriers even if he may be seeking to tint them with the complexion of shippers. This will be pursued further when we come to Mr. Justice Black's section on constitutional issues.1'7 There he certainly jumbles issues of various kinds and by no means confines himself to obligations of indemnity. The Chief Justice may be directing himself at this quite as much as at the scope of the indictment. He certainly does not take the ancient Field view that there is nothing interstate about insurance.'18 He plants himself on the well-established postulate that the business of writing insurance contracts is not commerce, and that the incidents of using inter- state communication and transportation in this noncommerce busi- ness do not turn it into commerce.'19 So far as the scope of the 136 Id. at 1179-80. 137 See pp. 983-97 infra. 138 The Chief Justice's opening paragraphs are as follows: " This Court has never doubted, and I do not doubt, that transactions across state lines which often attend and are incidental to the formation and performance of an insurance contract, such as the use of facilities for interstate communication and transportation, are acts of interstate commerce subject to regulation by the federal government under the commerce clause. Nor do I doubt that the business of insur- ance as presently conducted has in many aspects such interstate manifestations and such effects on interstate commerce as may subject it to the appropriate exercise of federal power. See Polish National Alliance v. National Labor Relations Board, 322 U. S. -, 64 S.Ct. 1196." " But such are not the questions now before us. We are not concerned here with the power of Congress to do what it has not attempted to do,-but with the question whether Congress in enacting the Sherman Act . . . has asserted its power over the business of insurance." Id. at 1I79. 139 " The questions which the Government has raised, advisedly it would seem (cf. New York Life Insurance Co. v. Deer Lodge County, 231 U. S. 495, 499, 34 S.Ct.

A new indict- ment could be framed to cover every conceivable activity of the insurance combination in the most specific terms and could charge the use of the mails and of express and of train travel of officers as crucial elements in the crime of suppressing competition. There would still remain the question whether contracting and not con- tracting across state lines and keeping others from contracting across state lines constitute restraints of trade or commerce or merely of something else like borrowing or lending money or giv- ing advice or some other service not amounting to a transfer of property. So much for the adjective. Now for the substantive. In his opening introductory paragraph Mr. Justice Black states the re- sult of the decisions which have sanctioned state power over in- surance.140 He does not, however, at this point report the legal reasons for those decisions. This omission may lead those un- familiar with past developments to assume more than is warranted from the statement that for the first time there is squarely pre- sented the question whether Congress has power under the com- and transportation in the conduct of the fire insurance business renders the business itself 'commerce' within the meaning of the Sherman Act and the commerce clause. The questions here are whether the business of entering into contracts in one state, insuring against the risk of loss by fire of property in others, is itself interstate com- merce; and whether an agreement or conspiracy to fix the premium rates of such contracts and in other ways to restrict competition in effecting policies of fire insur- ance, violates the Sherman Act. The court below has answered' no ' to both of these questions. I think that its answer is right and its judgment should be affirmed, both on principle and in view of the permanency which should be given to the construc- tion of the commerce clause and the Sherman Act in this respect, which has until now been consistently adhered to by all branches of the Government." 64 Sup. Ct. at II79. 140 " For seventy-five years this Court has held, whenever the question has been presented, that the Commerce Clause of the Constitution does not deprive the indi- vidual states of power to regulate and tax specific activities of foreign insurance com- panies which sell policies within their territories. Each state has been held to have this power even though negotiation and execution of the companies' policy contracts involved communications of information and movements of persons, moneys, and papers across state lines. Not one of all these cases, however, has involved an Act of Congress which required the Court to decide the issue of whether the Com- merce Clause grants to Congress the power to regulate insurance transactions stretching across state lines. Today for the first time in the history of the Court that issue is squarely presented and must be decided." Id. at 1164.</page><page sequence="45">1944] INSURANCE AS COMMERCE 981 merce clause " to regulate insurance transactions stretching across state lines." 141 This conveys no intimation that there is not com- plete novelty in the problem. Nor can it be said that in later paragraphs there is anything approaching adequate recognition of the principles underlying the many judicial declarations of the constitutional nature of the insurance business.142 If after such recognition those principles were found no longer acceptable and were rejected on the basis of changed conditions and of new light known to new judges, there would be a directness of approach which would leave for possible criticism only the questions of the wisdom of the practical judgment and the wisdom of making it the basis for the particular decree. Such an approach would guard itself against the danger of possible deception to the unwary. While it is true that earlier cases have not involved an Act of Congress which required the Court to pass on the national com- merce power over the insurance business, it by no means follows that in the case at bar " that issue is squarely presented and must be decided."143 The indictment before the Court was for an alleged violation of the Sherman Act. The constitutional issue is not presented unless the Sherman Act presents it. The interpre- tation of that statute would therefore seem to be the primary problem to consider. There is a familiar canon that a statute should if reasonably possible be so interpreted as to avoid raising a grave constitutional issue. True enough, the canon has some- times seemed to have been honored in the observance for the pur- pose of unwarrantably drawing the fangs from a statute. Contri- tion for such sins, however, should warn only against warping a statute to save it or to keep it from applying. It need not mili- tate against the wisdom and propriety of first discovering as ob- jectively as possible whether the statute properly interpreted does apply to the case. Instead of this, Mr. Justice Black first discusses the commerce power of Congress somewhat at large without con- fining the discussion to power over insurance or to the particular exercise of the commerce power upon which decision depends. Granted that Congress might in various other ways apply its com- merce power to the insurance business, it does not follow that it has sought to do so in this particular way or that it may do so in this particular way. 141 Ibid. 142 See pp. 990-92 infra. 143 64 Sup. Ct. at 1164.</page><page sequence="46">982 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 Some follower of Supreme Court doings has said that Mr. Jus- tice Black sets before himself the ideal of writing judicial opinions so that they can be understood by intelligent laymen. Whether this rumor derives from avowal or from observation and analysis, it is in one sense justified by the product. Mr. Justice Black's sentences have a verbal directness and lucidity that exemplify great skill in the practice of the persuader's art. Nevertheless, what may be completely clear so far as the words go, may not give to the previously untutored layman a full realization of all that lies behind the words. A word is not a crystal, we have been told. Some words have acquired a technical meaning that is tighter than their possible colloquial connotations. So also, many statements that are undeniably true may be irrelevant to the prob- lem in hand. Such irrelevance will not be obvious to the unini- tiated. In view of the widespread public interest in the insurance problem and the case under consideration, it may therefore be fitting to keep the laymen in mind while following the steps taken by Mr. Justice Black in the path toward his goal. The first thing to be noted is the language used in posing what should be the primary issue but what is relegated to later consid- eration. Question (i) is said to be: "Was the Sherman Act in- tended to prohibit conduct of fire insurance companies which re- strains or monopolizes the interstate fire insurance trade? 144 To some laymen insurance may possibly be loosely thought of as a trade, though one may be severely skeptical as to what would be the result of a poll on the point. In rural Vermont a half cen- tury ago the expression " goin' tradin'" meant going to a store to do some shopping. In England the difference between the "'olesale " and the " retail " was confined to the dealing in tangi- ble goods. The frequent collocation of " trade and finance " im- plies a difference between the two. Certainly many laymen must be as surprised to meet the expression " insurance trade " as they would be startled to see or hear " insurance commerce." They might wonder whether the novel usage sprang from carelessness or was designed as some sort of psychological or legal " plant " or charm to lull the unwary to miss the intellectual prestidigitation. The more sophisticated will be aware that if it were well-estab- lished that insurance is a trade, the wicked South-Eastern con- 144 64 Sup. Ct. at 1166.</page><page sequence="47">1944] INSURANCE AS COMMERCE 983 spirers might have been sent away comfortless by an uncontested memorandum opinion. While Mr. Justice Black poses first the question whether the Sherman Act was intended to apply to the conduct of fire insurance companies, he does not deal with it first. His second question is: "If so, do fire insurance transactions which stretch across state lines constitute 'Commerce among the several States' so as to make them subject to regulation by Congress under the Commerce Clause? " 15 Then with a quick turn around comes the state- ment: " Since it is our conclusion that the Sherman Act was in- tended to apply to the fire insurance business we shall, for con- venience of discussion, first consider the latter question." 146 The " convenience " is readily apparent from the standpoint of an ad- vocate seeking to establish a major premise from which a desired conclusion will easily follow. This same convenience, however, would be unfortunately deceptive from the standpoint of a tyro to whom the whole problem and its background are an unknown land. Though such a tyro would be warned and partly fortified against deception by first reading the dissenting opinion of the Chief Jus- tice, he might profit from a more particularistic analysis than would comport with the desirable decorum of an official opinion. Mr. Justice Black seems to get his case for commerce decided in his first paragraph on the commerce issue.'47 This invokes as the test of interpretation what was common parlance in the days of the Fathers, and asserts that by such common parlance " com- merce " included insurance. For this the support is that it included trade. This requires a definition of trade, and in his own words Mr. Justice Black gives it as " businesses in which persons bought 145 Ibid. 146 Ibid. 147 " Ordinarily courts do not construe words used in the Constitution so as to give them a meaning more narrow than one which they had in the common parlance of the times in which the Constitution was written. To hold that the word 'com- merce' as used in the Commerce Clause does not include a business such as insurance would do just that. Whatever other meanings 'commerce' may have included in I787, the dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other books of the period show that it included trade: businesses in which persons bought and sold, bargained and con- tracted. And this meaning has persisted to modern times. Surely, therefore, a heavy burden is on him who asserts that the plenary power which the Commerce Clause grants to Congress to regulate ' Commerce among the several States' does not include the power to regulate trading in insurance to the same extent that it includes power to regulate other trades or businesses conducted across state lines." Ibid.</page><page sequence="48">984 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 and sold, bargained and contracted." Of course if all bargaining and contracting were trade, insurance would be trade. So also would contracts of employment and also of marriage if financial settlements are part of the agreement. The priest, the sachem and the medicine man become traders. Judges trade their opinions for their pay. A distinguished judge of a western state was credited with selling an opinion in a will case for a half million dollars and other judges have been known to make what are called trades to get their appointments or nominations. In common par- lance today, some people trade their votes. They bargain and contract for them. In common parlance there is "commercial vice." Common parlance knows many figures of speech, but con- stitutional interpretation can no more be directed by figures of speech than by puns. The verbal path toward any desired goal would be facilis de- scensus if it needed only to be greased by puns or figures of speech. Mr. Chief Justice White used a sort of reverse pun to get his rule of reason in the Standard Oil case,'48 but that did not establish legitimacy. If figures of speech in the common parlance of today are not safe guides in constitutional and statutory interpretation, still more precarious is the enterprise of using common parlance of more than a century and a half ago. It would have been con- venient for the commentator if Mr. Justice Black had recited the ancient common parlance on which he relies. It may well have been more convenient for him not to do so. He contents himself with giving two citations in a footnote. One is to Gibbons v. Og- den 49 wholly at large with no pointer to any particular page or to any particular expression. He may have in mind the fact that Marshall said that commerce is intercourse.'50 This the great 148 Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U. S. I (I9Ii). Earlier the statute had been held to include all restraints of trade, whether reasonable or unreasonable. This interpretation is reversed in the case. In seeking to make out that there had been no change of interpretation, the Chief Justice pointed out that the statute had always been interpreted by the resort to reason. Thus, he means us to assume that the reasonable interpretation was that the statute excludes reasonable restraints of trade from its condemnation. In dealing with restraints, "unreasonable" is given the meaning of undue, immoderate, or unjustified. In dealing with previous inter- pretations "reasonable" signifies reached by a process of reasoning. See Powell, Supreme Court Decisions on Federal Power over Commerce III, 1910-1914 (1922) 6 MINN.

Never has it been thought that everything which might be embraced within the word "inter- course " is for that reason commerce. Moreover, Marshall's ref- erence to " intercourse" cannot help Mr. Justice Black on the nineteenth century meaning of trade, because Marshall is distin- guishing intercourse from the narrower concept of trade. The second citation to help in informing us that trade includes bargaining and contracting, meaning apparently all business bar- gaining and contracting, is to Hamilton and Adair's The Power to Govern.l5 This is a charming survey of the wide and varied usages of writers and lexicographers. It says nothing of insurance, and the index does not have the word. When we find that in con- sidering " commerce," the authors say that " Almost all the dic- tionaries of the times set down as a secondary meaning such a miscellany of terms as ' conversation,' ' society,' and 'inter- course,' 152 we see how little determining weight should be given to polite usage or common parlance in interpreting the Constitu- tion. Even if it were true that often commerce was used to apply to business enterprise and its antecedents to distinguish it from toil in raising or making something for personal use or consump- tion, this is a flimsy basis for a sudden new discovery that for three quarters of a century judicial predecessors have erred and strayed in lamentable ignorance of their mother tongue. If in 1787 insur- ance were trade and therefore commerce, it would be trade and commerce whether touched by a state or by the nation. On the question of definition the earlier cases cannot be dismissed be- cause they dealt with state power, and here at the moment Mr. Justice Black is concerned only with definition. If he can get enough votes he has power if not authority to make his own defini- tion. The matter to be recognized is that by assertion he is making his own definition and that his footnote references to others cannot disguise the fact. Had he been confident that these others gave him strong support, he might have shared his confidence with us by giving some detail of the support which he found. With the concluding sentence of this first paragraph on the com- merce issue,153 one may fully agree if allowed to omit the phrase " trading in insurance." Of course one would have a heavy bur- 151 (I937) 55-63. 152 Id. at 56. 15 See note 147 supra.</page><page sequence="50">986 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 den to argue that the commerce clause does not give authority to Congress to regulate the interstate insurance business. None of the dissenters does argue it. They would agree with the position of Alexander Hamilton, which Mr. Justice Black invokes in favor of the constitutionality of such regulation.'54 This, however, was not the question before the Court. The primary question was whether Congress had regulated this business fifty years ago. Be- fore coming to this question, Mr. Justice Black in posing and discussing the constitutional issue speaks of the insurance " trade " and of " trading " in insurance and by his broad definition of trade clearly implies that it embraces insurance, which would thereby make insurance into commerce in the constitutional sense. He passes from this question when he turns to the power of Congress to regulate the business. His support from Alexander Hamilton on this issue is no support for any view that insurance is trade. Mr. Justice Black does not seek to make it such, but this should be made clear to those who might not note the transition from one question to the other. They might be misled by the " therefore " of the concluding sentence and thus wrongly assume the paragraph to be more of a unit than it is. The immediately succeeding paragraphs present information that is interesting and true and irrelevant. In terms of function there is no doubt that " The modern insurance business holds a commanding position in the trade and commerce of our nation." 155 It may be of social rather than of legal significance that " Insur- ance touches the home, the family "; 156 but a legal tie may be found in its touching of " the occupation or the business of almost every person in the United States." 15 To what is clearly inter- state trade and interstate transportation, the coverage of insur- 154 "Alexander Hamilton, in 1791, stating his opinion on the constitutionality of the Bank of the United States, declared that it would ' admit of little if any question' that the federal power to regulate foreign commerce included 'the regulation of policies of insurance.' 3 Works of Alexander Hamilton (Fed. Ed., N.Y. 1904) pp. 445, 469-70.

He does, however, mention that insurance covers much movable and immovable property used in or associ- ated with interstate transportation. He speaks too of the inter- state traveling of agents and the interstate transmission of funds, policies, reports, and information. This would all be impressive, though no longer essential, if the Court were considering a federal statute premising a comprehen- sive regulation of insurance on its effect on commerce. It has no legal bearing on the conclusion drawn from it in the succeeding paragraph, which begins by saying: Despite all of this, despite the fact that most persons, speaking from common knowledge, would instantly say that of course such a business is engaged in trade and commerce, the District Court felt compelled by decisions of this Court to conclude that the insurance business can never be trade or commerce within the meaning of the Commerce Clause.. . 160 Many if not most persons, speaking from common knowledge, would all too instantly say a lot of things that a trained lawyer would know were based on technical ignorance rather than on technical knowledge. The classic statement on the difference be- tween common and uncommon knowledge is in the answer given to King James by Lord Coke when he said that " causes which concern the life, or inheritance, or goods, or fortunes of his sub- jects, are not to be decided by natural reason but by the artificial 158 Thames &amp; Mersey Marine Insurance Co. v.

The law should still be " the golden met-wand and meas- ure to try the causes of the subjects." 162 The common knowledge of persons untrained in the law is a precarious mentor of legal postulates and differentiations. For this, one can adduce melan- choly testimony from many lawyers who have suffered from the inapposite arguments of experts in economics and in what is mis- called political science. It is little less than shocking to have a Justice of the Supreme Court invoke the mere supposition of com- mon knowledge among lesser breeds without the law as worthy of consideration against the conclusion of a district court which preferred to respect its obligation to be faithful to superior con- trolling precedents rather than to traduce them by resort to vaguely indicated ancient locutions and to unspecified contempo- rary supposed common knowledge of supposed most persons. Granted that in dealing with novel issues there are more open spaces in constitutional law than in the more tightly articulated private law, there is still appropriate in public law an instinct of lawyership which the experts of a high profession should strive to respect and to possess. To the reference to the district court's reliance on the prece- dents, Mr. Justice Black adds: " We must therefore consider these decisions." 13 He then lists the cases and recognizes that in de- ciding them " the Court has relied upon the proposition that 'the business of insurance is not commerce '." 164 Such recognition is applied to the " business of insurance " and not merely to the is- suing of policies. The proposition thus relied on does not evapo- rate into legal nothingness, even though it is quite true, as the opinion next points out, that it was the basis of sustaining state regulation of insurance when there was no national regulation and when there were abuses in the business. Less certainly wholly true is the contrast asserted in what immediately follows: 161 Prohibitions del Roy, 12 Co. 63, 65, 77 Eng. Rep. 1342, I343 (I607). 162 Id. at 65, 77 Eng.

But past decisions of this Court empha- size that legal formulae devised to uphold state power cannot uncritically be accepted as trustworthy guides to determine Congressional power un- der the Commerce Clause .. .165 The phrasing here invites analysis. It is true enough that the Sherman Act " was intended to regulate certain aspects of the methods " of conducting commerce, and that on the record as it came to the Supreme Court, some of these methods had been in- dulged in by the defendant insurance companies. It is, however, a very different thing to say that the Sherman Act was intended to regulate the methods by which " interstate insurance companies " do business. If this means that the Sherman Act was intended to apply to the business of insurance companies, it is at the moment a mere assertion without argument of the crucial point in dispute in the case. Of course as a premise it will support an identical conclusion, but as either premise or conclusion it flies in the face of what may justifiably be assumed to be a contrary understanding from nearly fifty years of inaction by Congress and by the De- partment of Justice. It is a pity that the words of a Supreme Court opinion have to be scrutinized so meticulously to warn the uninitiated that they may beg the whole question at issue and not be a reliable statement of the law a moment before it became such by the decision in the case. A second comment to make on the paragraph in question ap- plies to the supposed request to narrow the scope of federal power to regulate the activities of insurance companies. There would be no narrowing of any heretofore assumed power if it were held that the Sherman Act does not apply to insurance activities. Again the question is begged by using the word " narrow." So far as the scope of constitutional power is concerned, it had become and would remain a very broad power to regulate the insurance enterprise in all sorts of ways, ways that would control it more extensively and more in detail than the Sherman Act has ever 165 Id. at II69.</page><page sequence="54">990 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 controlled railroads or industrial concerns. This is perfectly clear from the synchronous Polish Alliance case and from the dissenting views in the instant case, and there could have been no doubt about it earlier. It is of course true that " legal formulae devised to uphold state power " do not of their own weight involve nega- tives on national power. They may, however, point to a difference between proper and improper handles available to national power. They may lead to a judgment that fifty years ago Congress did not wield the particular handle now for the first time judicially found available. It involves no uncritical acceptance of a formula to make it mean what the opinion of the Court has already recog- nized that it means, i.e., that " the business of insurance is not commerce." The business of insurance like the practice of law does not become " commerce among the States " because it makes use of communication and transportation which is such "com- merce." A similar confusion of two different issues appears in the sen- tence which follows. "Furthermore," continues the argument, "the reasons given in support of the generalization that ' the busi- ness of insurance is not commerce' and can never be conducted so as to constitute 'Commerce among the States' are inconsistent with many decisions of this Court which have upheld federal statutes regulating interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause." 16 The appropriate footnote to such a statement would be one referring to statutes and cases. The one which is appended points to neither of these but quotes or cites the views of insurance officials and others who take opposing positions on the bearing of Paul v. Virginia on the constitutionality of national regulation of insurance. The sentence in question, however, may be designed as merely introductory to succeeding paragraphs in which cases are induced in support. Insofar as such cases are inconsistent with any generalization that the insurance business can never be con- ducted so as to be subject to the national commerce power, they are acceptable at full face value. If counsel for the defendant companies adduced any such sweeping generalization, he went far beyond the necessities of his case. It is not made by the minority. It was not in issue in the case, and there was no occasion to com- bat it. 166 64 Sup. Ct. at 1169.</page><page sequence="55">1944] INSURANCE AS COMMERCE 99I The succeeding analysis of the reasoning in Paul v. Virginia would be open to little criticism if the rejection of it were directed to the support of a Congressional statute explicitly dealing with the interstate activities of insurance companies. The quoted as- sertion from an earlier case that insurance policies " are not com- modities to be shipped or forwarded from one State to another " 167 is countered by saying that " both before and since Paul v. Vir- ginia this Court has held that Congress can regulate traffic though it consist of intangibles." 168 For this there are cited four cases dealing with navigation,'69 telegraphic communication,'70 electrical transmission,7' and the shipment of lottery tickets.'72 The in- tangibility of the lottery tickets was more in their fruits than in their composition, but of course interstate transportation and com- munication are interstate commerce. The other two cited cases deal with the running of hospitals, one in interpreting the word " trade " in a treaty,"7 and the other in applying the Sherman Act in the District of Columbia.174 The treaty case invoked the duty of liberal interpretation. For the District of Columbia, Congress is a local legislature. Hospitals charge for supplies furnished pa- tients. These cases may very well help to establish that Congress may regulate the interstate insurance business, but they are not inconsistent with any generalization that " the business of insur- ance is not commerce." Again it must be to the point of interstateness that comment is directed to earlier support adduced for state power on the analysis that " insurance policies are mere personal contracts subject to the laws of the state where executed." 15 This reason, says Mr. Jus- tice Black, " rests upon a distinction between what has been called 'local ' and what' interstate,' a type of mechanical criterion which this Court has not deemed controlling in the measurement of fed- eral power." 176 For this we are cited to two anti-mechanical ob- 167 Id. at 1169-70. 168 Id. at 1170. 169 Gibbons v.

The first is in a case sanctioning a state law re- stricting agricultural production and marketing notwithstanding the federal statute on the same subject and the Sherman Act.'77 The second is in the case that sanctioned national power to dis- courage a farmer from feeding his animals with grain grown in excess of a determined quota.'78 These cases and declarations show that state and nation with different leverages may deal with the same subject matter, as we now well know. On interstateness, too, must be the bearing of a concession that " We may grant that a contract of insurance, considered as a thing apart from negotia- tion and execution, does not itself constitute interstate com- merce." 179 Since it would be hard to consider any written contract apart from its negotiation and execution, it would seem that Mr. Justice Black must be confining his concession to contracts " apart from " interstate negotiation and execution. If so, the concession is apparently introduced merely to dismiss it from relevance to the issue whether the commerce power of Congress can lay hold of insurance by reason of its interstate features.180 This issue is no longer matter for debate. 177 Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341, 360 (I943). 178 Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. III, II9-20 (I942), see pp. 97I-72 supra. 179 64 Sup. Ct. at 1170. 180 Perhaps the concession may go so far as to agree hypothetically that the insurance contract itself may be always merely local, as Mr. Justice Field asserted. As to this the reader may decide for himself from the comment which follows the concession: " But it does not follow from this that the Court is powerless to examine the entire transaction, of which that contract is but a part, in order to determine whether there may be a chain of events which becomes interstate commerce. Only by treating the Congressional power over commerce among the states as a 'technical legal conception ' rather than as a 'practical one, drawn from the course of business' could such a conclusion be reached. Swift &amp; Co. v. United States, 196 U. S. 375, 398, 25 S.Ct. 276, 280, 49 L.Ed. 518. In short, a nationwide business is not deprived of its interstate character merely because it is built upon sales contracts which are local in nature. Were the rule otherwise, few businesses could be said to be engaged in interstate commerce." Ibid. This concluding sentence is highly questionable. In support of it Mr. Justice Black invokes a comment by Mr. Chief Justice Taft on the Swift case, italicizing the statement that " It refused to permit local incidents of a great interstate movement, which taken alone were intrastate, to characterize the movement as such." Id. at 1171, n.27, quoted from Chicago Board of Trade v. Olsen, 262 U. S. I, 35 (I923). The Swift case involved the rigging of sales to Chicago packers of cattle in Chicago at the time of sale.

The fact that the " stream of commerce " idea had to be invoked</page><page sequence="57">1944] INSURANCE AS COMMERCE 993 Constitutional law on state and national power over commerce has become much more fluid since Paul v. Virginia and the Deer Lodge case. In the latter, Mr. Justice McKenna said that "if insurance is commerce and becomes interstate commerce when- ever it is between citizens of different states, then all control over it is taken from the states, and the legislative regulations which this court has heretofore sustained must be declared invalid." 18 Mr. Justice Black quotes part of this statement, but instead of beginning his quotation with Mr. Justice McKenna's conditional clause, he substitutes language of his own. In reporting a reason advanced to support state power over insurance, his conditional clause is "that, if any aspects of the business of insurance be treated as interstate commerce, ... 182 This he follows with the rest of Mr. Justice McKenna's statement about all control be- ing taken from the states. In 1913 when Mr. Justice McKenna wrote, it would have made a big difference whether " insurance is commerce" or whether merely some aspects of the business of insurance be treated as interstate commerce. Nor has the differ- ence as yet wholly vanished. The commerce clause still gives some broader protection against state taxation than does the Four- teenth Amendment. State power to exclude foreign corporations differs according to whether the business in which they are en- gaged is or is not interstate commerce. If there is to be any stability in the law, the effect on state power from turning the in- surance business into interstate commerce would be different in various situations from the effect of merely holding that Congress may treat some aspects of it as interstate commerce. Though Mr. Justice Black saved the space of only three words by saying " if any aspects of the business of insurance be treated as interstate commerce " instead of quoting " if insurance is com- merce and becomes interstate commerce whenever it is between here to swallow these intrinsically local sales, affords no support for Mr. Justice Black's apprehension that " Were the rule otherwise, few businesses could be said to be engaged in interstate commerce." Practically every industrial enterprise is en- gaged in interstate commerce because it makes sales of goods under contracts calling for their delivery across state lines. The existing commerce law on these enterprises would be unaffected if the Court continued to agree with Mr. Justice Field that insurance, since it is not commerce, is not interstate commerce. 181 23I U.

The choice of phrasing would not greatly matter if the issue under consideration at the moment were the full constitutional scope of national power over interstate insurance. Something else, however, was the purpose of the argument in this paragraph. If it were only to show that Mr. Justice McKenna gave one bad reason in his Deer Lodge opin- ion, this could not by itself upset the other foundations. Mr. Justice Black is not directly asking that the Deer Lodge case be overruled, because his position is that it never bore on the question of national power. His purpose is to lull any fears that the sanc- tion of national power over some aspects of insurance will threaten the continuation of state power over others. This may be why he speaks of aspects of the business instead of insurance as interstate commerce. The preference may seem intellectually helpful so far as it serves to establish that the states will not lose all power over insurance because Congress also has some power over it. It may however be less useful in making it indubitably clear that the Sherman Act was from the beginning designed to apply to inter- state insurance. Mr. Justice Black may have this in mind when in developing his argument that the fear of state atrophy is " inconsistent with many decisions of this Court " he at one point speaks of " whether the particular activity affected by the state regulation is a part of interstate commerce." 183 Yet what he really seems to be doing is to be beclouding all long recognized distinctions, condemning them 183 The full dismissal of the fear that state power will evaporate is as follows: "Accepted without qualification, that broad statement is inconsistent with many decisions of this Court. It is settled that, for Constitutional purposes, certain activi- ties of a business may be intrastate and therefore subject to state control, while other activities of the same business may be interstate and therefore subject to federal regulation. And there is a wide range of business and other activities which, though subject to federal regulation, are so intimately related to local welfare that, in the absence of Congressional action, they may be regulated or taxed by the states. In marking out these activities the primary test applied by the Court is not the mechani- cal one of whether the particular activity affected by the state regulation is part of interstate commerce, but rather whether, in each case, the competing demands of the state and national interests involved can be accommodated. And the fact that particular phases of an interstate business or activity have long been regulated or taxed by states has been recognized as a strong reason why, in the continued absence of conflicting Congressional action, the state regulatory and tax laws should be de- clared valid." 64 Sup. Ct. at 1171.</page><page sequence="59">1944] INSURANCE AS COMMERCE 995 by calling them " mechanical," and rejecting them for a sort of free-for-all test or lack of test of " whether, in each case, the com- peting demands of the state and national interests involved can be accommodated." 184 For this he cites cases involving what is indubitably interstate commerce. For some of his readers he will not dispel the feeling that he is substituting the chaos of complete particularism for the previously recognized legal discriminations, even though he proffers a Platonic soothing when in a footnote he says: That different members of the Court applying this test to a particular statute may reach opposite conclusions as to its validity does not argue against the correctness of the test itself. Such differences of judg- ment are inevitable where solution of a Constitutional problem must depend upon considered evaluation of competing Constitutional objec- tives. ,. .185 It may be seriously questioned whether there is wisdom in ap- plying the word " test " to such a vague conception as the accom- modation of the competing demands of state and national interests. The phrase does well enough to summarize the varied particulari- ties incident to the judicial umpiring of the federal system; but a blanket summary is not a test. Among the applications embraced by the summary there are subordinate analyses and judgments and lines of demarcation that afford a frame of reference amount- ing to a recognizable structural system and confining judicial judgment and discretion within measurable bounds. Respect for such a system may of course impose constraint against annihila- tion or erosion of established landmarks. Yet such respect has long been thought consonant with the profession of a legal order and correspondingly preferable to any competing ideal of free rein to judicial errancy. Without attaching undue significance to the use of a loose phrase in a single judicial opinion, a phrase may nevertheless be symptomatic of a more or less general attitude. If such an attitude finds a not novel exemplification in a particular decision under consideration, the language of the supporting opin- ion may merit a notice that otherwise might seem hardly worth taking. 184 See note 183 supra. 185 64 Sup. Ct. at II7I, n.3I. Mr. Justice Black is of course referring to dis- agreements as to the validity of the statute, not of the so-called test.</page><page sequence="60">996 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 Such shortcomings as may be thought to invade the supporting argument do not militate against full acceptance of Mr. Justice Black's denial that " if any aspects of the business of insurance be treated as interstate commerce,' then all control over it is taken from the States '." This, however, is not saying that no control will be taken from the states. Mr. Justice Black does not say it. Nor, as the dissenting opinion of the Chief Justice points out,'86 does he indicate with any clarity where lines will or should be drawn. The implication that the immunities from state power enjoyed by interstate commerce generally may continue to be withheld from insurance because of its former status 17 merely in- creases the confusion likely to ensue from revolutionary judg- ments in complicated situations. The problems bid fair to be sufficiently varied and difficult to baffle even the acumen and con- fidence of some judicial Mr. Anthony. They are adverted to by Mr. Justice Jackson 88 and will be familiar to all students of com- merce-clause law. They are not simplified by Mr. Justice Black's lumping together of police and tax issues in his citations and in his text. His assurance that he is not harming state power as much 186 " In the years since this Court's pronouncement that insurance is not com- merce came to be regarded as settled constitutional doctrine, vast efforts have gone into the development of schemes of state regulation and into the organization of the insurance business in conformity to such regulatory requirements. Vast amounts of capital have been invested in the business in reliance on the permanence of the exist- ing system of state regulation. How far that system is now supplanted is not, and in the nature of things could not well be, explained in the Court's opinion. The Government admits that statutes of at least five states will be invalidated by the de- cision as in conflict with the Sherman Act, and the argument in this Court reveals serious doubt whether many others may not also be inconsistent with that Act. The extent to which still other state statutes will now be invalidated as in conflict with the commerce clause has not been explored in any detail in the briefs and argument or in the Court's opinion." 64 Sup. Ct. at II88. 187 See the concluding sentence in note 183 supra. 188 " The Court's decision at very least will require an extensive overhauling of state legislation relating to taxation and supervision. The whole legal basis will have to be reconsidered. What will be irretrievably lost and what may be salvaged no one now can say, and it will take a generation of litigation to determine. Certainly the states lose very important controls and very considerable revenues." Id. at II92.

The four remaining paragraphs of the treatment of the com- merce issue need no detailed analysis. They start with the assur- ance that " The real answer to the question before us is to be found in the Commerce Clause itself and in some of the great cases which interpret it." 189 The regard for authority is not in itself to be condemned. The cases invoked, however, are those on trans- portation and communication. The expressions quoted are gen- eral in character and for the most part prior to the Deer Lodge case. The hortatory peroration on judicial responsibility is worthy of emulation. All that is said would be quite appropriate, and no longer needed, to sanction a variety of hypothetical statutes by which Congress might deal with the interstate aspects of the in- surance business as it has dealt with labor and agriculture and finance. It was doubtless found convenient to consider at length such broad and uncontested issues, as it was found convenient to postpone consideration of the intent and scope of the Sherman Act until after it was established what Congress might do if it so chose. V While Mr. Justice Black postpones his Sherman Act interpreta- tion to an independent section, the Chief Justice in dissenting does not make so complete a segregation. Naturally much of his argument applies equally to Constitution and statute. Naturally also, Mr. Justice Black's constitutional persuasion leads him easily to find the indictment warranted by the Sherman Act. Mr. Justice Jackson takes a middle or at least an intermediate ground. He thinks that insurance really is commerce as a matter of fact, but he would not join in changing its legal name until Congress clearly asks him to do so.190 He does not analyze his dichotomy between 189 Id. at II71-72. 190 " The principles of decision that I would apply to this case are neither novel nor complicated and may be shortly put: i. As a matter of fact, modern insurance business, as usually conducted, is com-</page><page sequence="62">998 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 fact and law, and it may be charitable for others to emulate his example. The distinction hardly matters in its particular setting, though in others it may matter much.19T Mr. Justice Jackson did not need to invite philosophical trouble here by seeming to imply that material things have some sovereign power to rule upon their own qualities. When he says earlier that he cannot " make any satisfactory distinction " between insurance and other enterprise held to be commerce,"92 he is in substance saying that because of his judgment about the insurance facts as compared with other facts, he would as an unfettered constitutional magnate rule that insurance also is commerce. He does not so rule, because he does not deem himself unfettered. So he will for the nonce swallow what he regards as a fiction that has given insurance an unwar- ranted " doctrinal status." With this conviction, the problem for Mr. Justice Jackson is one of judicial behavior as participant in the joint enterprise of governmental administration. So he inquires: "What role ought the judiciary to play in reversing the trend of history and setting the nation's feet on a new path of policy? " 193 The foundation for an answer he finds in comparing the two bases on which the Government's invocation of the Sherman Act might possibly be sanctioned. The first would be to overrule the old cases and hold that insurance is commerce and has been commerce either always or at least for fifty years. Such reversal of doctrine would involve a serious menace to the continuation of hitherto enjoyed state power. The second basis of upholding the prosecution would be to find in the Sherman Act a grip on acts of insurance companies that substantially affect or burden interstate commerce. This merce; and where it is conducted across state lines, it is in fact interstate commerce. 2. In contemplation of law, however, insurance has acquired an established doc- trinal status not based on present-day facts. For constitutional purposes a fiction has been established, and long acted upon by the Court, the states, and the Con- gress, that insurance is not commerce. 3. So long as Congress acquiesces, this Court should adhere to this carefully con- sidered and frequently reiterated rule which sustains the traditional regulation and taxation of insurance companies by the states." 64 Sup.

This second view appeals to Mr. Justice Jackson, and he would favor applying the Sherman Act to " combinations in the course of insurance business to commit acts not required or authorized by state law, such as intimidation, disparagement, or coercion, if they unreasonably restrain interstate commerce in commodities or interstate transportation." 194 He recognizes that such an inter- pretation of the statute would not permit the Supreme Court under the Criminal Appeals Act to do the necessary disentangling of the different counts in the indictment.'95 There would have to be a remand to order the work to be done below. It would be an in- teresting eventuation if a later phase of this case or if some other similar case should come to the Supreme Court when it is so staffed and so split that Mr. Justice Jackson's vote is essential to a ma- jority decision. His essay here might then be the inspiration of the controlling gospel. This suggests that the four who here sanc- tioned what is officially the opinion of the Court might not have been foolish if they had seen the fitness of confining themselves to ground on which they would be joined by a fifth and thus had remained content to await Congressional initiation for any further advance. The accident of their temporary elevation to power might have been thought a sufficient reason for moderating their determination that one step was not enough for them. There are-of course plenty of precedents that acts not themselves commerce may restrain interstate commerce within the purview of the Sherman Act. The conductors of boycotts and committers of sabotage were not engaged in commerce by refusing to work 194 Id. at 1192. Earlier Mr. Justice Jackson said: "This would require the Gov- ernment to show that any acts it sought to punish affect something more than insur- ance and substantially affect interstate transportation or interstate commerce in some commodity.

There can hardly be doubt that Congress could re- store for the future the earlier judicial interpretations of the com- merce scope of the Sherman Act even if a majority of the Justices would find some other way to spare saboteurs from national con- demnation. Since the evaporation of the Knight case,99 manufac- turers may run afoul of the Sherman Act by methods of control through ownership of corporate stock though such ownership is not itself commerce.200 True, the enterprises thus relieved from non- competitive control are themselves engaged in commerce, as were the manufacturers whose mills were damaged or whose stone was not put in place. These considerations, however, would not mili- tate against a judicial proposal to bring within the Sherman Act the acts of insurance organizations which have the requisite ef- fect on noninsurance enterprise that is concededly interstate com- merce. With the vexing question whether under the combination of the indictment, the decree of the district court, and the Criminal Ap- peals Act, the entertainment of such a view was open to the Court in the case before him, Mr. Justice Jackson does not deal, though he notes that its application must be consigned first to subordi- nates.20' One who is not a specialist in the intricacies of federal judicial procedure must fear to tread farther than where it is pos- sible to observe that differently minded Justices in minority have charged different majorities with warping the rules of jurisdiction and procedure in the interest of preferred substantive results in particular cases.

The mere observer can get enough of a glimpse to doubt whether as interpreted and ap- plied the procedural rules remain cast-iron. Without, however, discounting the importance of procedural rectitude, it may be re- peated that if it were here conceded that only the broad question of commerce or not commerce were open for review, a new indict- ment could be drawn to call for judgment on the issue on which Mr. Justice Jackson takes a side which might bring some conduct of insurance companies within the Sherman Act because of its effect on commerce. The acceptance of his view would by no means chart a path of complete clarity for the course ahead. It would protect the states in their present taxing powers and in much of their regulatory control over foreign and domestic corporations as corporations. Yet there would be difficulties and doubts by reason of duplicated power over their contracts and ways of contracting. Further- more, as Mr. Justice Jackson says, " The orderly way to national- ize insurance supervision, if it be desirable, is not by court deci- sion but through legislation." 202 He would be ready by judicial decision to make certain aspects of company conduct subject to the Sherman Act. The supervision would be based on legislation, but it would be determined by the Department of Justice or by dissatisfied rivals, subject to the approval of the Supreme Court. This may not differentiate such supervision from the other regu- lations under the Sherman Act, but it would differentiate it greatly from the controls with administrative participation engendered by recent Congressional statutes dealing with labor, agriculture, and finance. It would be the product of judicial initiation with noth- ing approaching assurance that such was the Congressional de- sign. Mr. Justice Jackson indicates but dimly how far his judicial initiation would go. He confines himself to acts which would " un- reasonably restrain interstate commerce in commodities or inter- state transportation." 203 Insurance companies might conceivably combine to put interstate transportation and sale at a disadvantage as compared with local trade and carriage. They might inflict boycotts on interstate commerce as laborers have done. Mr. Chief Justice Stone recognizes that conduct of this type might be brought 202 64 Sup. Ct. at 1194. 203 See note 194 supra.</page><page sequence="66">1002 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 within the Sherman Act under long established interpretations.204 Mr. Justice Jackson does not explicitly go any farther than the Chief Justice. He is spared from indulgence in specifics by rea- son of the restrictions of the Criminal Appeals Act. Yet in a foot- note he says that " The Government contends that at least Count One of the present indictment conforms to this interpretation of the antitrust laws." 205 Unfortunately he gives no specific refer- ence to the Government brief. Count One had to do with the maintenance of noncompetitive rates of insurance. These and other restraints are rejected by the Chief Justice because " such effects on the commerce as do not involve restraints in competi- tion in the marketing of goods and services are not within the reach of the Sherman Act." 206 It would seem that at any rate the area of practical difference between the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Jackson must be a rela- tively minor one as compared with the area of difference between the majority and the minority in the case. All three dissenters take the majority to hold that, though a mere contract of insurance may not be interstate commerce, the insurance business as an inte- grated enterprise is interstate commerce itself when conducted 204 " in this respect insurance contracts do not in point of law stand on any different footing as regards the Sherman Act. If contracts of insurance are in fact made the instruments of restraint in the marketing of goods and services in or affect- ing interstate commerce, they are not beyond the reach of the Sherman Act more than contracts for the sale of commodities, - contracts which, not in themselves interstate commerce, may nevertheless be used as the means of its restraint. But since trade in articles of commerce is not the subject matter of contracts of insur- ance, it is evident that not only is the writing of insurance policies not interstate commerce but there is little scope for their use in restraining competition in the marketing of goods and services in or affecting the commerce." 64 Sup. Ct. at II83. 205 See note 195 supra. 206 64 Sup. Ct. at II8i. Later the Chief Justice adds: " If the business of entering into insurance contracts is not interstate commerce, it seems plain that agreements to fix premium rates, or other restraints on compe- tition in entering into such contracts, are not violations of the Sherman Act. As we have often had occasion to point out, the restraints prohibited by the Sherman Act are of competition in the marketing of goods or services whenever the competition occurs in or affects interstate commerce in those goods and services. See Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U. S. 469, 495-501, 6o S.Ct. 982, 993-996, 84 L.Ed. 1311, I28 A.L.R. o144, and cases cited. The contract of insurance does not undertake to supply or market goods or services and there is no suggestion that policies of insur- ance when issued are articles of commerce or that after their issue they are sold in the market as such, or, if they were, that the formation of the contract would itself be interstate commerce. .. ." Id. at 1183-84.</page><page sequence="67">1944] INSURANCE AS COMMERCE 1003 across state lines.207 Therefore restraints on the conduct of the insurance business may come within the Sherman Act without proof of restraints on enterprise not insurance. With this, Mr. Justice Jackson would agree as a matter of rational analysis. He would even agree on the authority of the Lottery Case and the case applying the Holding Company Act.208 This disregards the long- familiar distinctions between regulation of transportation, com- munication and transmission, and regulation of what is none of these. Insofar as Mr. Justice Jackson would make his special position of some practical importance in the case, it would seem that he takes too lightly the burden of intimating that the law as to insurance had already been changed by these two cases. According to Mr. Justice Jackson's view the Court finds itself in a practical dilemma when faced with the choice between follow- ing the long established law on insurance or changing it on a re- vised analysis. By the light of today the Court ought to declare 207 Mr. Chief Justice Stone: " But it is quite another matter to say that the con- tracts are themselves interstate commerce . . ." Id. at 182. "The decision now rendered repudiates this long continued and consistent con- struction of the commerce clause and the Sherman Act. .. ." Id. at II87. "The question then is not whether an earlier decision should ever be overruled, but whether a particular decision ought to be. And before overruling a precedent in any case it is the duty of the Court to make certain that more harm will not be done in rejecting than in retaining a rule of even dubious validity. .. ." Ibid. " But this Court can decide only the questions before it in particular cases. Its action in now overturning the precedents of seventy-five years governing a business of such volume and of such wide ramifications, cannot fail to be the occasion for loosing a flood of litigation and of legislation, state and national, in order to estab- lish a new boundary between state and national power, raising questions which cannot be answered for years to come, during which a great business and the regula- tory officers of every state must be harassed by all the doubts and difficulties in- separable from a realignment of the distribution of power in our federal system. These considerations might well stay a reversal of long established doctrine which promises so little of advantage and so much of harm. For me these considerations are controlling." Id. at 1189. Mr. Justice Frankfurter: "I join in the opinion of the CHIEF JUSTICE." Ibid. Mr. Justice Jackson: "Instead of overruling our repeated decisions that insur- ance is not commerce, the Court could apply to this case the principle that even if it is not commerce the antitrust laws prohibit its manipulation to restrain interstate commerce, just as we hold that the National Labor Relations Act . . . prohibits insurance companies, even if not in commerce, from engaging in unfair labor practices which affect commerce. . ." Id. at 1191. " But the Court now is not following, it is overruling, an unequivocal line of authority reaching over many years. .. ." Id. at 1192. 208 Electric Bond &amp; Share Co. v. SEC, 303 U. S. 419 (I938).</page><page sequence="68">1004 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 the insurance business to be commerce. To do so, however, would threaten the power long exercised by the states and never assumed by Congress. From this dilemma Mr. Justice Jackson cannot es- cape by holding that insurance is commerce but that the Sherman Act of I890 never embraced it as such. Such a differentiation would for the moment at least accord to insurance companies a large freedom both from the Sherman Act and from an undefined congeries of state regulations. The latter would be undesirable in substance and perplexing and confusing in application. So it should not be done. Therefore, as a practical matter, the Court should not at the moment revise its constitutional theory. It is not called upon to do so in order to sanction national power. It is not called upon to do so by any indubitably clear constitutional or statutory imperative. The Court, therefore, as a wise practi- cal governor should yield to the past for a moment and not let the new dawn of constitutional insight be accredited as an over- powering noonday sun. It would seem that Mr. Justice Jackson might have saved him- self and others a lot of trouble if he had said simply: "As an original question if it first arose today I would think that insur- ance is commerce. However, in deference to a long line of con- trary authority, I yield my personal views and join in the dissent- ing opinion of the Chief Justice." So far as the particular case is concerned, his position seems little different in result than if he had so joined. He may, however, have had some more general problems of judicial administration in mind. This may perhaps be inferred from his earlier shoving of some accounting problems into the realm of fact,209 and perhaps from his invocation of an earlier case for the recital that " This Court only recently recog- nized that certain former decisions as to the dividing line between state and federal power were illogical and theoretically wrong, but at the same time it announced that it would adhere to them be- cause both governments had accommodated the structure of their laws to the error." 210 However this may be, Mr. Justice Jackson 209 Dobson v. Comm'r, 320 U. S. 489 (I943). This case is the target of the article cited in note 191 supra. 210 64 Sup. Ct. at 1192, citing Davis v. Department of Labor (317 U. S. 249, 255 (1942)). This Davis case may be questioned both as a model of judicial behavior and as fully fitting what Mr. Justice Jackson says of it. Here the question was whether a state compensation act could apply to a drowning in a navigable river.</page><page sequence="69">1944] INSURANCE AS COMMERCE 1005 here clearly refrained from turning his doctrinal conviction that insurance is commerce into an official judgment that would yield a determination to that effect by a majority of the full Court. The quotations already given from the opinions of the Chief Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen (244 U. S. 205 (1917)) had held not. Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart (253 U. S. 149 (I920)), and Washington v. W. C. Dawson &amp; Co. (264 U. S 219 (1924)) had held that Congress could not permit state compensation laws to apply to injuries within the scope of admiralty jurisdiction. Congress there- after passed the Federal Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (44 STAT. 1424 (1927), 33 U. S. C. ? 901 (I940)), providing a federal compensation plan for injuries upon navigable waters and making the federal remedy exclusive. The compensation statute of the State of Washington was confined to injuries within the legislative jurisdiction of the state. The deceased employee in the case came clearly within the federal act under Parker v. Motor Boat Sales (314 U. S. 244 (I941)). His widow sought compensation under the state law. The state supreme court denied compensation. The United States Supreme Court reversed by a vote of eight to one, only the Chief Justice dissenting. The underlying ground of Mr. Justice Black's opinion seems to be that since the deceased and others similarly situated would in many cases find it hard to proph- esy whether they would ultimately be held to have died in admiralty or in state pastures, they may have their choice. The Chief Justice denounced the doctrine and declared that he could not concur in the judgment unless the Jensen case were to be overruled in its constitutional doctrine. If this were done, then he would permit application of the provision in the federal statute permitting actions at law or in equity when the employer had failed to give security for compensation under the federal statute. This must be under the assumption that with the abolition of the Jensen doctrine would go also the cases denying federal power to permit the appli- cation of state law. This would bring the drowning within the legislative jurisdiction of the state so far as the Federal Constitution is concerned even though it was also within the admiralty jurisdiction. The difficulty in the situation was that Congress had adopted a dividing line from a constitutional decision that had ceased to retain judicial respect. Congress had precluded application of state power over injuries within the federal statute. But for this federal statute, the Court would undoubtedly be ready to overrule the Jensen case and to sanction state power. Yet it had to concede that the federal statute is constitutional. It would remain constitutional even if the Jensen case were overruled. In effect it would seem that the Court had to overrule the Jensen case as constitu- tional doctrine to let the state law here apply, but this could not overcome the nega- tive of the federal statute. This latter feat was accomplished by a theory of " twi- light zone" which would serve employees or their beneficiaries to choose either remedy in close cases where there is no barrier in apposite administrative or judicial action. All this shows merely that the Court can make a great strain to do what it thinks is practically best in a messy situation. It is hard to see how it illustrates adhesion to a dividing line considered illogical and theoretically wrong " because both governments had accommodated the structure of their laws to the error." What the case did was to blur a dividing line announced by both federal and state statutes and to create a "common because of vicinage " because it thought the line too vague for practical reliance, even if the case at bar came clearly within a decision putting it on the federal side.</page><page sequence="70">ioo6 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 Justice and of Mr. Justice Jackson sufficiently disclose their views both of the constitutional and of the statutory issue. They reveal their judgment of the views and of the action of the majority. On the statutory issue, both opinions invoke the fate of abortive pro- posals for national regulation of insurance and furnish satisfactory evidence that Congress has never been ready to deal with the in- surance business on an assumption that as a business it is itself interstate commerce. There are details of urgings and recom- mendations always meeting with refusals. There are reports of Judiciary Committees declaring the absence of national power. There is the uniform record of nothing done. To the plain man as well as to the lawyer, this would seem to be enough on the issue of statutory interpretation even if it could be fully conceded that on the constitutional issue the Supreme Court had been woefully stupid and wrong for three quarters of a century. Against all this, what does Mr. Justice Black have to say on the statutory issue? So far as words could do so, he puts an end to controversy in his opening sentence: " We come then to the con- tention earnestly pressed upon us by appellees, that Congress did not intend in the Sherman Act to exercise its power over the inter- state insurance trade." 211 This assumes both the power of Con- gress and the judgment that insurance is trade. It leads to the easy answer that " Certainly the Act's language affords no basis for this contention." 212 No Q. E. D. could be more facile or more ele- mentary: Congress says trade. Insurance is trade. Congress means insurance. By begging the question, the answer is readily derived. Once thus derived, it is equally simple to point to an absence of evidence that Congress intended to exclude any part of what its words are thus asserted to embrace. Yet in spite of Mr. Justice Black's assertion to the contrary,213 the Chief Justice points to evidence 211 64 Sup. Ct. at 1174. 212 Ibid. 213 " We have been shown not one piece of reliable evidence that the Congress of I890 intended to freeze the proscription of the Sherman Act within the mold of the then current judicial decisions defining the commerce power." Id. at 1176.</page><page sequence="71">1944] INSURANCE AS COMMERCE 1007 that Congress intended to stay within then recognized constitu- tional bounds.2l4 It is doubtless true, insofar as such statements contain what may be called truth, that "'Trusts' and 'monopolies' were the terror of the period." 215 To show that " Combinations of insur- ance companies were not exempt from public hostility against the trusts," 216 Mr. Justice Black invokes state laws forbidding in- surance combinations and a decision sustaining one of them in an opinion saying that " In order to meet the evils of such com- binations or associations, the state is competent to adopt appro- priate regulations that will tend to substitute competition in the place of combination or monopoly." 217 One wonders why this hostility did not manifest itself in indictment of insurance com- panies under the Sherman Act or in definite amendments of the statute to make such indictment clearly possible. Hostility that manifested itself only in state regulation is surely a weak reed with which to whip up an intent on the part of Congress to deal with what the Supreme Court had clearly declared to be a matter for the states. Again Mr. Justice Black is subject to criticism for a further statement and supporting proof. " Nor is it sufficient," he says, " to justify our reading into the Act an exemption for insurance that the Congress of I890 may have known that the states were already regulating the insurance business." 218 It is question 214 Mr. Culberson: "There is no attempt to exercise any doubtful authority on this subject, but the bill is confined strictly and alone to subjects over which, con- fessedly, there is no question about the legislative power of Congress. ..." Id. at I85, n.5. Senator Edmunds: "We would frame a bill that should clearly be within our constitutional power, that we would make its definition out of terms that were well known to the law already, and would leave it to the courts in the first instance to say how far they could carry it or its particular definitions as applicable to each particu- lar case as the occasion might arise. . . ." Ibid. Senator Hoar: " Now we are dealing with an offense against interstate or inter- national commerce, which the State cannot regulate by penal enactment, and we find the United States without any common law. .. ." Ibid. Some of these expressions are doubtless related to the terms "restraint" and " monopoly " rather than to what is commerce. 215 Id. at 1174. 216 Id. at II75. 217 Ibid.

Ct. at II77.</page><page sequence="72">10oo8 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57 begging to speak of " reading into the Act an exemption " and it is unduly delicate to speak of what Congress " may have known." The supporting argument is that "The Congress of I890 also knew that railroads were subject to regulation not only by states but by the federal government itself, but this fact has been held insufficient to bring to the railroad companies the interpretative exemption from the Sherman Act they have sought. United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, i66 U.S. 290, 3I4, 315, 320-325. . . 219 Railroads were engaged in commerce, and the states had been forbidden to regulate their interstate rates.220 Thus doubly is this analogy inapposite. The railroad analogy is again adduced in support of this fur- ther point: " Whether competition is a good thing for the insur- ance business is not for us to consider. Having power to enact the Sherman Act, Congress did so; if exceptions are to be written into the Act, they must come from the Congress, not this Court." 221 Here once more is the assumption that the issue was all settled in I890 and that the Court is asked to take out something that Congress had put in. In view of the actual history, the protesta- tion of the judicial duty of self-denial and of obeisance to Con- gressional will comes with a peculiar grace. On analysis this sec- tion on the interpretation of the statute adds but a new weakness to the opinion as a whole. When a judge with the neat intellectual skill of Mr. Justice Black proves lame and peccable in reasoning, it is an argument pro homine rather than ad hominem to suggest that the trouble lies in the illegitimacy of the design. It is hardly necessary to add that detailed consideration of the opinion in no way mollifies the shock to the profession when the result of the decision was announced. Thomas Reed Powell.
