<plain_text><page sequence="1">The residual humanism of hybridity: retaining a sense of the earth David Lulka The concept of hybridity has become an influential theoretical tool for examining and reconsidering relations between society and nature. Although benefits have accrued from this school of thought, this paper contends the deployment of hybridity within the geographic discipline falls short of its reconstitutional claims. These shortcomings are a consequence of the original sources used to develop the language and logic of hybridity. Although the concept of hybridity has a long history in the biological sci- ences, the utilisation of hybridity in the geographic discipline has predominantly relied upon evolving theories developed in science and technology studies. This paper indi- cates how Hara way's cyborg and Latour' s Middle Kingdom limit the scope of hybridity by portraying humanity as central to hybridity. The pervasive centrality of humans within the literature on hybridity (1) limits the ability of geographers to embrace post- structuralism in its entirety and (2) diminishes the discipline's claim to credibly repre- sent the (natural) landscape. This paper argues for a thicker hybridity by borrowing from emergent theories in the biological sciences, wherein hybridity is conceived as a common occurrence that frequently takes place outside the direct purview of society. Rather than reifying nature, thick hybridity forces society to embrace environmental uncertainty more than it has heretofore. key words hybridity humanism cyborg actor-network theory animals nature Liberal Studies Department, California State University, San Marcos, San Marcos, CA 92096, USA email: dlulka@csusm.edu revised manuscript received 19 February 2009 Introduction The concept of hybridity has become so central to the leading edge of geographic research that I argue it is now necessary to reconsider its disci- plinary use. I thus begin here with three funda- mental questions. First, can it be possible that when geographers speak of hybridity, a concept saturated with symmetry, they are still speaking more about themselves - humans - than non- human entities? Second, can it be that when geographers speak of hybridity, they are violating some of the fundamental tenets of constructivism and post-structuralism that undergird this notion? Lastly, can it be that when geographers speak of hybridity, they are undercutting their ability to satisfactorily represent the geographic landscape? These are big questions, to be sure, and they will be used to orient the following discussion of hybridity. What draws me into these dilemmas is a concern about the concept's portent for other animals, other species. This concern did not emerge out of hap- penstance, but rather paralleled disciplinary trends wherein, after a period of substantial neglect (Philo and Wolch 1998), animal geography re-emerged as a vibrant topic of concern following publications by Wolch and Emel (1998) and Philo and Wilbert (2000). Numerous papers have since been published on various aspects of animal geography. Notwith- standing this growth and the presumed relevance of 'hybridity' to these examinations, it is not clear that the theoretical assumptions inherent in the con- cept's current definition have been fully recognised, or that the potential limitations embedded in the term's present meaning have been perceived. These specific concerns about nonhuman animals by no means delimit the extent of the concept's importance. Indeed, the processes of inhabiting and becoming are central to hybridisations and Trans Inst Br Geogr NS 34 378-393 2009 ISSN 0020-2754 © 2009 The Author.

This notion of 'in itself became problem- atic within geography and other disciplines some time ago, most notably with the attacks on realism and objectivity coincident with the rise of construc- tionism (Soulé and Lease 1995; Gandy 1996; Gerber 1997; Proctor 1998). Although these caveats were warranted, they created a pastiche that had deleteri- ous disciplinary consequences, for it effectively thinned out the world. Nowadays, it is accepted in many quarters that this theoretical move was too extreme, and consequently our conceptions of con- structionism have widened considerably (Demeritt 2002), though not enough as I will suggest. Con- structionism now implies a whole host of materiali- ties, a condition that can help to reform the humanist tendencies of 'hybridity' itself. These materialist constructions should not be seen in opposition to textual notions of construction, but rather as a further complication. In this paper, the term 'in itself (or similar variants) should not be construed as an attempt to assess nature from an objective, pre-reflective perspective, because the term (as used here) does not relate to issues of per- ception. As the following discussion indicates, the presence of humans is irrelevant to this articulation of nonhumans, as there is no attempt here to draw out with any certitude the exact character of the nonhuman. Here, I simply want to present some aspects of hybridity that should remain in our purview, much like gnats circling our heads, when the term is applied by geographers. This is a precautionary note, for I contend the geographic literature on hybridity is still embedded with a residual human- ism.2 In some respects, I want to re-hijack hybridity from the social sciences, take it back across town to another disciplinary village, not to naturalise the process, but to nonetheless account for greater breadth and thickness in the world of relations. Such a reconsideration of hybridity's scope can firm up 'social' theory, partially suture up the gaps separating the human and physical wings of geog- raphy, and form productive links between geogra- phy and the biological sciences. Cyborgs and nonhumans To begin this analysis, I assert, given current par- lance, what appears to be a contradiction: that 'hybridity', as it is known and practised in the geo- graphic discipline, is humanist at its core. This seems counterintuitive for the notion of hybridity is predicated upon the mixing, exchange or inher- ent inseparability of different domains. Yet, far from thinking that the concept has been fully dis- sected and adequately explained, I contend the concept is in further need of dissection and redis- tribution. This is admittedly an odd statement - to dissect (the ultimate act of separation) for the goal of expanding the scope of hybridity. Nonetheless, this conclusion can be drawn by teasing out the origins of the hybrid approach within social scien- tific writings. Alternately, this finding can be based upon the distinct use of hybridity in the social sci- ences as compared with the biological sciences. Indeed, I suggest that 'hybridity' in the social sci- ences has stopped short, failing to fully account for the agencies that exist in the world, the agencies, ironically, that such research attempts to explicate. Hybridity, as it is propounded, is a zone of licen- tiousness, but it has not been taken far enough. It should not be characterised as a zone or liminal region of interaction between humans and non- humans, even one that is wave-like in formation, but rather as a spatially pervasive phenomenon. As such, I want to reformulate hybridity in order to adequately acknowledge the wide scope of agency on earth. For those of us who study non- human animals, the current register proves hardly satisfactory. The origins of a hybrid approach precede the widespread use of the term in the social sciences. Like most good ideas, the notion emerged before it was fully codified in thought. For explanatory rea- sons, I will begin by considering Hara way's (1985) cyborg, though it was by no means the original explication of material/cognitive heterogeneity. Indeed, Franklin (2006) sees the embryonic pres- ence of the cyborg in one of Hara way' s earlier texts written in the mid-1970s. Despite its fantastic char- acter, Haraway's cyborg was unmistakably human. This is not to say that the cyborg looked human, for the details of its articulation were left unspeci- fied, left appropriately to the imagination of the reader and the unpredictable trajectory of future developments. The cyborg is fundamentally impure, comprised of assorted bits of uncommon ancestry. The cyborg is permeated by prostheses that will look inhuman to any contemporary eye. To the degree that the cyborg is perceived as a form of empowerment, technics and normative Trans Inst Br Geogr NS 34 378-393 2009 ISSN 0020-2754 © 2009 The Author.

Yet to say that these attri- butes and capacities are fully incorporated into the body/psyche of the cyborg seems incorrect, for the cyborg appears alien (probably even unto itself). It is clumsy, at least in its conformation, having ema- nated from different affordances. Be this as it may, these incongruities (which may be of benefit to the cyborg that possesses them) are not the problem here. Rather, the greater difficulty, one which I believe is ultimately debilitating for its ability to contend with environmental issues, is that the cyborg could not be mistaken for any other animal. For such reasons, I believe, Halliwell and Mousley (2003) have classified Haraway's work as 'techno- logical humanism7. It is human, all too human. Thus, Kull states, somewhat paradoxically, that 'Haraway is looking for a figure of humanity out- side the narratives of humanism' (2002, 285). This in part relates to the feminist agenda behind the cyborg, which cannot be understood properly with- out reference to human historical developments. The non-essential character of the cyborg was partly in response to the oppressions and inequali- ties emerging from historical categorical forma- tions. From these inessential properties, several issues emerge. A language of 'monsters' has developed that speaks of these impurities, although often with a more negative connotation (Davies 2003; Graham 2004). Haraway is generally more positive in this regard, and while she is aware of the potential pit- falls, it is far from clear as to whether such mind- fulness is perpetuated in subsequent theorising. As Field notes: I agree with Haraway that we cannot simply ignore the extent to which our embodiment is technologised in modern Western societies. However, I remain sceptical about the consequences of formulating this into a new 'cyborg feminism'. I suspect that in the current climate of technological fervour it may be just a little too easy to drop the self-reflexivity that Haraway intends to accompany such a formulation. (2000, 46) In this regard, liberating impurities may simply be channelled into pre-existing hierarchies. I am dri- ven to note here that 'hybrid' shares the same ety- mological root with 'hubris' (Shipley 1984, 423), both terms suggesting a certain profligacy that inti- mates excessiveness, transgression and impropri- ety. What is critical to the present discussion, however, is that humanity, whatever that may be, is ever-present in the midst of these developments. Can it be that rather than diluting the prominence of humanity through the articulation of impurities, the cyborg simply distributes humanity further abroad much like technology (and the societies that 'possess' it) has had a penchant to do? In this sense, a cyborgian philosophy is humanist, albeit bastardised in a sense. I do not want to delve into technophobia here, however, as this has been done and it does not strike at the heart of the present argument. More rele- vantly, though, this argumentation about cyborgs can be oriented in another direction, regressively, one might say, toward the technology of the past. Inglis and Bone have reasonably questioned when the cyborg might have emerged, stating that: Moreover, we might ask: where do we define the histor- ical and epistemological points where more banal forms of human tool-use and environmental manipulation turn into the status of the fully fledged cyborg - is it with the weapon-wielding early human, the medieval scribe, the modern typist or the contemporary computer geek? In the same vein, but this time in terms of descriptions of genetically-modified animals - such as Haraway's (1997) favoured figure of the genetically- modified 'OncoMouse' which she understands as a particular sort of cyborg figure - the sceptic might plausibly ask as to the extent to which these represent fundamental departures from 'traditional' practices to do with the selective breeding of livestock. (2006, 278-9) I, too, would like to take the cyborg backward, but not towards humanity, but to the banal and tradi- tional practices of nonhumans. This glance is not intended to regain nature per se. Rather, I want to ask in what sense, in their relations with other objects, other bodies, are nonhumans cyborgian (and thus hybrid) in their own right? I will return to this critical question later in the paper, but for now it is sufficient to note that the indefinite origin of the cyborg leaves this matter seriously in question. To be fair, though Haraway has studied relations between humans and other animals (1989 1997 2003 2008), the image of the cyborg was not devel- oped for such purposes. It developed more con- cisely out of a feminist agenda, one that had serious concerns of its own to address (see Gane's (2006) interview with Haraway). Nonetheless, this state of affairs cannot be used as an excuse either, for its limitations are significant even if it has been dragged into a whole host of other affairs against its will.

The cyborg, for all of its hybridity, cannot address the issue of nature - in the more pervasive manifestations of that word that intimate other species and other inorganics. It does not speak of natures other than the inessential nature of the human and its prostheses. Nonethe- less, despite these limits, the underlying philoso- phy of the cyborg has been incorporated into discussions of nature and animal others, if not directly, then indirectly, by those who have been partially inspired by Haraway's writing of this creature. It would seem best, therefore, to look elsewhere, to where a resemblance with humanity is more dif- ficult to decipher, where the agential 'body7 is more appropriately decomposed and widely distributed. In speaking of hybridity and urban nature, Braun (2005) swings the theoretical pendulum in this opposite direction, contending that the problem with Haraway's cyborg is that it bears too much similarity with the bounded, coherent singularity of an organism. Thrift (2006) has made a similar argument with regard to the concept's limited applicability to environmental topics. Unfortu- nately, in disavowing the prominence of humanity, Braun and Thrift discredit (through association) the significance of other organisms and move quickly past the whole host of lively nonhumans that live in society's midst in order to get to other forms of dispersive agency. The baby is thrown out with the bathwater. This speaks to a blind spot in the geo- graphic discipline, which led Philo and Wolch (1998, 104) to state that 'by the 1970s animal geog- raphy had all but disappeared from the discipline' and Wolch and Emel's (1995) effort to reintroduce the topic in their paper entitled 'Bringing the ani- mals back in'. There has been, it seems, consider- able equivocation about the place of nonhuman corporeality in geographical writings that has yet to be fully resolved. That ambivalence may be appropriate, but it should not be justified on the contention that corporeality retains the taint of humanism. Conversely, the concept of the trickster, which exhibits a similar transience and capriciousness but retains some distance from humanism, has received considerably less exploration. As Haraway observed, The Coyote or Trickster, as embodied in Southwest native American accounts, suggests the situation we are in when we give up mastery but keep searching for fidelity, knowing all the while that we will be hood- winked. (1988, 593-4) It is striking that the trickster unwittingly pointed to companion species, an emphasis that Haraway has recently embarked upon. Had researchers embarked upon a different trajectory and looked toward the coyote instead of the cyborg, would they be in a better position to think about the scope of hybridity? The Middle Kingdom This rush to inclusion of non-living matter has troubled other visions and considerations of non- humans. To this end, an exploration of the theoreti- cal underpinnings of actor-network theory (ANT) is helpful. ANT emerged prior to Haraway's cyborg. One critically important aspect of ANT (and science studies more generally) is that the per- spective originated in the context of scientific set- tings, most notably those sited within laboratories. This had significant ramifications for hybridity, because the settings were always 'artificial', whereby the human, whether through placement of the nonhuman or simple observation of the non- human, was always central to the examined hap- penings. This may even be said to be true in cases where chemicals were observed to interact with one another. In time, ANT studies were extended out into the wider environment, such as in the studies of Pasteur, scallops and naval navigation, but that is not to say that ANT (or those influenced by it) extracted itself from the mindset of the labo- ratory where humans are central. This condition needs be kept in mind, for the orientation of sci- ence studies is not the same as the discipline of geography. Phenomena of the wider world, which I will not call 'natural', have played a more forma- tive role within the disciplinary development of geography. I contend that this fact has sometimes been forgotten by geographers, resulting (as I state below) in a thinning of the world not unrelated to acts of human expropriation. The early writings of Latour, Callon and Law (e.g. Callon 1980; Callon and Latour 1981; Callon et al 1986; Law 1986; Latour 1987) are among the initial sources for this perspective, but they are by no means the only proponents. The number of researchers that have adopted some of the tenets of ANT are now legion. I myself can be counted Trans Inst Br Geogr NS 34 378-393 2009 ISSN 0020-2754 © 2009 The Author.

Central to the perspective articulated in ANT, and the one that is most rele- vant to hybridity, is the notion of symmetry. The concept of symmetry was developed to convey the pervasiveness of agency in the world. For Latour and others, not only did humans possess agency, but so did other animals, plants and a virtually inexhaustible collection of inorganic enti- ties. By such means, the power of human agency was balanced by the power of nonhuman agen- cies. More than that, human agency, in any com- prehensive sense, was said to be predicated upon the enrolment of nonhuman agencies. Indeed, social structure only emerged from the successful alignment of several nonhuman agencies. For such reasons, social structure is always tenuous, always susceptible to a collection of forces that may undermine its cohesiveness. In this very important respect, ANT may be seen as a preferential alter- native to the cyborg, for the structure and height- ened agency that emerges out of symmetry bears even less resemblance to humanity. This finding would seem to legitimise the application of ANT to a wide(r) range of environmental topics. A boulder, 'running' water and nonhuman animals (to be selective) certainly play a part in these hap- penings. But again, how this symmetry (i.e. hybridity) is understood, confused and deployed with regard to nonhuman animals, has ultimately affected its salience. What must be understood is the manner in which these conceptual apparatuses relate humans, nonhuman animals and hybridity. To get a better sense of the problematic, a look at Latour' s (1993) We Have Never Been Modern is helpful. In that influ- ential text, Latour seeks to dissolve the distinction between society and nature, a distinction brought about by modernism, inverted yet replicated in postmodernism, and deeply embedded in the Mod- ern Constitution. The Modern Constitution refers to the prevailing situation whereby Western society has conceived itself to be completely separate from nature, whether by virtue of the self-proclaimed objectivity of modernism or, conversely, the lin- guistic emphasis of postmodernity that posits humanity's fundamental inability to grasp nature in any way, shape or form. Latour attempts to convey the fallacy of this per- spective in different ways. One way he addresses this problem is through the notion of the 'Middle Kingdom', whereby the human is inherently entan- gled with the nonhuman (see also Callon and Latour (1992) for a conception of the middle ground). By such means, humans and nonhumans became irredeemably hybrid, signified most promi- nently by Latour' s notion of a 'quasi-object'. This theoretical manoeuvre made sense, for Latour was primarily interested in sealing the gap between society and nature that was created by modern and postmodern viewpoints. But in comparing and jux- taposing the human and nonhuman, other prob- lems were generated. The equation of 'human' and 'nonhuman' implies that researchers are discussing counterparts, whereas in reality this juxtaposition is not accurate. The usual objection is that ANT skews power relationships by contending that ANT diminishes the power of humans (Castrée 2002). Here, I would note in contrast that the equation diminishes the power of the nonhuman, for it por- trays (I suspect unintentionally) the nonhuman as a singular entity. As Jons notes: Within ANT, however, other-than-human organisms are lumped together with inanimate objects under the label 'non-humans'. This raises the question whether inanimate objects and other-than-human organisms can in fact be treated equally when analysing network- building processes, or if this concept implies an unpropitious human-centred perspective, which ANT originally strived to overcome. (2006, 572) There are, I believe, similarities here with Derrida's (2002) critique of 'animal', the other counterpoint to the human, which in its generality applies to a disparate collection of individuating forms without indicating any specificity. To be clear, although case studies have enumerated many particularities, the schematic of human-nonhuman symmetry, which has infiltrated many writings, does not achieve the same end. Theoretically, readers may be led erroneously to believe, following this logic, that when a nonhuman encounters a nonhuman, it is encountering itself. I am reminded, in this sense, of Merleau-Ponty' s (1968) conception of the flesh, in which the individual encounters itself as another by virtue of touch. But this comparison, of course, is inexact, for the nonhuman can truly encounter another nonhuman as other, for that is rightly how nonhumans are conceived. A 'nonhuman' is not a 'nonhuman' is not a 'nonhuman'. More than Haraway, ANT does not distinguish corporeality from non-corporeality within the mate- rial field they share. For some theorists, I suspect, this is a virtue, but I am not inclined to think so. This is a point of blindness, which does not Trans Inst Br Geogr NS 34 378-393 2009 ISSN 0020-2754 © 2009 The Author.

This tendency to invest actu- ally brings them more in alignment with humanity than with other forms of nonhumanity. A while ago, Latour (1999) referred to agency as a circulat- ing process, but there is no illusion that this inter- active process bears similarity to the metabolic process of an organism. Similarly, in response to Philo (2005), Whatmore (2005) indicated that she wanted to avoid a pre-occupation with 'warm- blooded' visions of the nonhuman. Though not exclusionary toward animals, Whatmore7 s assertion again points to a demotion of, or lack of prominence attached to, nonhuman liveliness. I do not want to move nonhuman animals to either extent of the pendulum's swing, but rather to retain an adequate sense of difference. From the beginning, then, the character of (inter)relations, of hybridity, is skewed, for the nonhuman is an extremely impoverished term that cannot account for the multiplicitous ways of (non)life in the world. In short, there is currently no depth to the term 'nonhuman'. And because there is no depth to the term, there is no way of conceiving that nonhumans may act in hybrid ways, largely out of reach of society, that have nothing to do with humans. By depth, I am refer- ring variously to the taxonomic hierarchy of the animal kingdom, the temporally-indicative geolog- ical strata of the land, and the spatial abysses of the oceans (to name a few). Each of these depths conveys a distance, wherein hybridity can occur and subsequently re-emerge in our contemporary 'social' relations. I am not referring to a depth akin to the unconscious, for the depth referenced here is still comprised of surfaces, albeit of differ- ent natures. What the prevailing conceptualisation needs to regain is a sense of the earth's thickness, its obtuseness, a quality that the current use of symmetry and hybridity does not convey. That thickness, moreover, can disabuse us of the notion, in mind and practice, that society has already appropriated the world, a theoretical leap that has been leapt far too prematurely and absolves us of contending with serious environ- mental questions because the deed is supposedly already done. This issue of depth or thickness is critical. Philo touched upon a similar aspect of hybridity, though he characterised it differently. In discussing What- more' s Hybrid Geographies, Philo stated: And yet, might it not be that the animals - in detail, up close, face-to-face, as it were - still remain somewhat shadowy presences? They are animating the stories being told, but in their individuality as different species, even as individuals - they stay in the margins more than is the case for humans in, say, the qualitative and cultural turns of the discipline over recent decades. There are numer- ous epistemological, methodological and positional- ethical reasons for why this might be so, as Whatmore herself acknowledges. I also suspect that she prefers to focus on what she calls the 'performative' aspects of wildlife (what animals do), rather than trying to imagine the more 'interior' aspects of wildlife (what animals pos- sibly think, feel, experience, intend, etc.), precisely to avoid dangers of anthropomorphism. (2005, 829) Philo merges the asymmetricality of disciplinary hybridity with the consciousness or interiority of nonhuman animals. Philo's comments about Whatmore' s lingering antipathy toward anthropo- morphism are particularly interesting, for anthro- pomorphism is often deemed to be the antagonist of objective modernism, the approach that ANT is explicitly attempting to break down. Here, while sympathetic to Philo's concern, I want to split the difference, accentuating geography's inability to plumb the depth of nonhuman relations, but with- out delving into intractable questions of cognition. The shadowy presences may likely include many rationalities, but they most certainly include a trove of substantiating relationalities that are not acknowledged in many expositions of hybridity. To be explicit, it should be clear that the Middle Kingdom between society and nature is not always, or the only, means by which hybridity is realised. More exactly, to say that the human becomes hybridised through its relation with 'nature' does not mean that nature only becomes hybridised through contacts with 'society'. I want here to regain Latour's (1988) sense of globalism and networks, in which global networks do not cover all space, but rather, like nets, contain gaps within them. Might this be wilderness by another name, one not predicated upon large spaces but one where nonhuman hybridity nonetheless proceeds? Geographers readily acknowledge that cultures are hybrid by virtue of economics, development and migration (e.g. Samers 1997; Ley 2004; Cupples et al 2007; Fitzgerald 2007). Young (1995) did delve into biological/racial utilisations of hybridity, but his critique of Victorian science primarily reaffirmed the social functions of 'hybridity7, emphasizing the role 'hybridity' played in the Trans Inst Br Geogr NS 34 378-393 2009 ISSN 0020-2754 © 2009 The Author.

Geographers, on the other hand, seldom discuss hybridity in relation to the world at large. To the contrary, as it is almost universally portrayed in geographic writings, the nonhuman animal only becomes hybrid through its relation with society/humanity. Though writings in ANT excel in describing the proliferation of nonhumans, the diagram of the Middle Kingdom, with its counterbalance of human and nonhuman, still seems to dominate geographical analyses of hybridity. Herein lies the residual aspect of humanism within the geographic discourse on hybridity. The hybridity of nonhuman animals is always refer- enced back to a centre of sorts, that centre being human society. This grounding seems fundamen- tally incorrect. Are there not ways for other ani- mals to be hybrid without the involvement of humans or society more generally? If not, are geog- raphers simply disavowing the multiplicity of agencies that ANT has thrust before us? Perhaps what I am troubled by is that in defining a zone of turbulence, the interstitial region of socionatural creations where change is said to occur, there has been a commensurate pacification of nature in itself. There appear to be connections with the postmodern disavowal of wilderness here. In adopting, for example, a Deleuzian perspective, which emphasises surfaces, plateaus, planes, hori- zontalities, geographers have perhaps unduly incriminated wilderness, which implied mystery and depth, because it violated the symmetries, the schematic of the middle ground, that geographers now exalt. In reacting to the cultural political rheto- ric of wilderness by portraying wilderness as a pas- tiche, perhaps it was forgotten that animals, among others, actually do engage, sometimes quite idio- syncratically, in these places among themselves. Let me clarify. Two general forces are at work here, which lend inertia to the recognition of hybridity but fail to acknowledge the disparate character of hybridity. Firstly, ANT is generally preoccupied with the mechanisms underlying structure, as seen in Latour' s (2005) Reassembling the Social Secondly, although Demeritt (2009) rightly notes that much environmental research by geographers has become compartmentalised into specialisations that extend outside the disciplinary boundary of geography and connect more strongly with other sciences, there is nonetheless a strong disciplinary vein fashioned around the resolution of the gap between human and physical geography (Castrée 2003). Whether due to lip-service given to pedagogical responsibilities within universities, a more general call for integrative science (both of which Demeritt alludes to), or the ethical/theoreti- cal convictions of certain practitioners, this strain of thought persists. In part, this was reflected in human geographers' disaffection with the concept of 'wilderness' following Cronon's (1995) examina- tion of the term. The advent of a more tactile hybrid focus within geography has intensified this scepticism. This objective has generated disciplin- ary repercussions, leading to an emphasis upon a specific, albeit abstract, type of interaction, namely 'human-nonhuman relations'. Although beneficial insights have been generated by this perspective, I also contend the current parameters of 'hybridity' have unintentionally perpetuated some undesirable assumptions. A few examples will suffice. In his study of India, Robbins too relied upon the early indigenous domesticants to support his statement that Nature was never partitioned from society, since the two are indistinguishable in the objects, such as juliflora communities, of the world around us. Thus, the land- scapes of Godwar have never been modern, precisely because of the efforts to make them so. (2001, 655; origi- nal italics) Such sentiments seem to contradict biological his- tory and the fact that humans, themselves, emerged at a specific locale, only later to diffuse widely across the earth. In a similar vein, What- more contends that Rather than an exterior world of original nature, I start with the premise that animals (and plants) designated wild have been, and continue to be, routinely caught up within multiple networks of human social life. (2002, 9) In these moves, slippage has occurred, and so it is necessary to distinguish between two conceptions of hybridity. In the first, which I believe is more consistent with ANT, hybridity necessarily emerges from embodied perceptions. This is what Ivakhiv (2002) calls 'original hybridity' and roughly matches Latour' s notion of the 'quasi-object'. In the other conception, taken up in geography, it is nat- ure that is always hybrid. Though this melds well with a disavowal of wilderness, it is a misapplica- tion when it implicitly reifies the all-pervasive actions of humans. In this regard, my concerns mimic the problems identified by Lee and Brown (1994), wherein ANT permits no exteriority. Trans Inst Br Geogr NS 34 378-393 2009 ISSN 0020-2754 © 2009 The Author.

Let me be clearer: ontologically speaking, nature has always been hybrid (nothing exists in isola- tion), but this says nothing about humans' involve- ment with nature. Thus it is important to maintain this distinction between types of hybridity. To get around this problem, it is necessary to keep in mind Swyngedouw's exhortation that there is no 'thing-like' ontological or essential founda- tion (society, nature, or text) as the process of becoming and of hybridisation has ontological and epistemologi- cal priority. (1999, 448) This applies to the hybrid, in its particular instanti- ations, notably that which has a human presence, as much as anything else. Swyngedouw employs insights from Marx, but this emphasis on the ephemeral has some affinity with Deleuze's prior i- tisation of becoming over being (De Landa 1999). In speaking of the necessity of retaining the unti- mely nature of hybridity, Drichel notes: Through the loss of disjunctive temporality, a performa- tive hybridity turns into an ontological hybridity. As a 'single new form', hybridity falls prey to the metaphys- ics of presence and becomes yet another ontological fix- ture, thereby not only losing its ethical promise but also becoming locked into an irresolvable opposition between (ontological) otherness and (ontological) hybridity. (2008, 606) That fixed presence, particularly as it refers to a nature, is exactly the problem that conflicts with notions of becoming. If human hybridisation with nature is still occurring, and I think it is, this neces- sarily implies some form of exterior in relation to humanity, wherein nonhumans may hybridise, pro- gress, flounder and develop as they will. While opening a door for history to emerge around nature, the hybrid critique of the wilder- ness pastiche soundly closed off other avenues for untoward development. Within the literature, the door into history is provided by humans, who enrol nonhumans into a distinct strata. As Ander- son noted with regard to domestication, 'Living artifacts - hybrids of "culture" and "nature" - were brought into socially embodied form' (1997, 465). Yet, it seems to me that as one door opened, another option for enlivenment, where nonhumans interact differentially among themselves, in prox- imity or distant from society, was closed. I do not think this is intended, but that it is so, largely through omission or oversight. Or perhaps, as I suspect, these nonhuman engagements are still seen as small. For example, in speaking of Barbara Smuts in her latest book, Haraway states that 'her idiom leaves the baboons in nature, where change involves only the time of evolution../ (2008, 25). There is an implied diminution here. This relative quiescence can be contrasted with the dynamic produced by the highly variegated assortment of 'social' contraptions that have been meticulously detailed by geographers. However, as the emerging theory of niche construction indicates (see below), nonhuman structures play a much stronger constit- utive role than this traditional perspective on nat- ure admits. Thick hybridity At this point in time, I believe it is fair to ask whether the concept of hybridity has become a fetish in its own right, albeit one that is more secular in tone, more deeply grounded in material- ities, and hence more real than wilderness. Hybridity in this sense becomes the point of not-quite-salvation. In speaking of her latest book, Haraway states, When Species Meet strives to build attachment sites and tie sticky knots to bind intra-acting critters, including people, together in the kinds of response and regard that change the subject - and object. (2008, 287; original italics) Her intentions are positive, to be sure, but there is almost a promethean quality to these contacts, one that is emboldened by a similar, yet distinct, zeal that compelled modern humans toward wilderness. As in colonialism, there is no suggestion of con- sent, no sense here that 'others' want to be con- tacted and tied up in knots. Some nonhumans do consent, some even advance the proposition of engagement, but others do not. That is thickness. Haraway contends that these hybrid contacts are the means for becoming 'worldly', an interesting term that can mean openness but also suggests a sense of possession. Visions of wilderness, it may be said, were perhaps more humble in that they were simply regional in their scope. Hybridity is not a licence for engagement, even though humans are necessarily hybrid. Again, the equation is not reversible. Yes, 'wilderness' posed a primordial, ahistorical nature, but that does not mean that human interactions with nature are the only means for Trans Inst Br Geogr NS 34 378-393 2009 ISSN 0020-2754 © 2009 The Author.

Evolutionary history informs us of that, but there is a much easier way of conceptualising this condition. When two species meet, are they not themselves engaged in a hybrid formation? It seems as though the recent critique of wilderness and the emboldening of social theory through hybridism have accepted a more holistic conception of nature, one that does not see such inter-specific relations as hybridic but as a more seamless, harmonious ecological web that is itself incapable of generating history. This perspective seems to rely on some form of human exceptional- ism that runs counter to the most fundamental principles of hybridity. Is a salmon less hybrid when it interacts with/evades a bear than when it slips from the hands of a human? Such a question is deeply infused with a sense of kinds that runs counter to a theoretical prioritisation of relations. Let me complicate this further by bringing in Donna Haraway (2008) again, whom in her latest offering tweaked Latour' s adage (like Robbins above) by stating several times that 'we have never been human'. Though overstated, this assertion is reasonable. Thoroughly imbricated with others dur- ing the trajectory of our own development, human- ity loses some integrity even though it remains distinguishable. This cannot help but have conse- quences for conceptions of hybridity, for it at least minimally disengages hybridity from the iconic fig- ure of Man. Perhaps, then, geographers can be assured by the presence of distinct 'species', rather than humanity, as the minimum requirement for hybrid- ity to take hold. Yet, is it even necessary to refer to separate species in this regard? It has been sug- gested that nonhuman species themselves have cul- ture, a fact that would obviously have implications for hybridity, as intraspecific populations of non- equivalence meet or diverge in their mode of being. As Laland and Hoppitt note with regard to the changing attitude of the social and physical sci- ences: Indeed, after much painstaking self-analysis and soul searching, many social anthropologists seem to have given up on the notion of culture altogether. Ironically, and perhaps benefiting from blissful ignorance of the problems, biologists and students of animal behavior are currently giving unprecedented attention to the 'cul- ture' of other animals. (2003, 150) They further note that many definitions of culture have a 'hackneyed' appearance, a quality that is disparaged in the human sciences, but one that may be quite beneficial for considering the hetero- geneous and contingent character of animal lives. The parameters of such 'cultural' dynamics are highly variable. The type of species, ranging from primates (Perry and Manson 2003; Sapolsky and Share 2004), to birds (West et al. 2003), to cetaceans (Rendell and Whitehead 2001), may vary. The 'cul- ture' may revolve around materials (e.g. tool use) or around modes of communication (e.g. vocalisa- tions or patterns of grooming). These cultural des- ignations are, of course, debatable, but in truth researchers do not know how far such penchants extend into nature (Gibson 2002; Lestel 2002). Such 'cultures' indicate some difference in the way spa- tially-situated populations do things, that nonhu- man populations may not substitute for one another 'as a whole' should they meet, and that they may generate turbulence if they do interact. Geographers have become quite good at (dis)assembling society, but they are not on par when it comes to decomposing nature. I am not referring to an atomisation here, but a more com- plete embrace of the heterogeneous relations that now exist in the world. This would certainly be a difficult task, because the majority of social theo- rists are not acquainted with the particularities of nature. Yet, this precarious task might force us into beneficial alliances. In this complex of associations, a first stab at depicting these events may look toward the process of becoming feral, wherein nonhumans relate to a new set of nonhumans upon escape, perhaps wandering into the gaps of Latour' s porous net, a space previously referred to as wilderness but now secularly denoted as the environment. A reasonable alliance could be formed with physical geographers, that other disci- plinary village, except for the fact that most physi- cal geographers appear more comfortable studying vegetation patterns, perhaps because the generally broad and seemingly immobile distribution of veg- etation conforms more readily to a landscape per- spective and the Cartesian pattern of human settlement and administration. Or conversely, because the overtly transient character of animal life does not conform as easily to these carto- graphic objectives, it appears that animals still remain somewhat neglected. That emphasis, guided by a methodology and pragmatism con- nected with larger spatial scales, is unfortunate, for it reaffirms a sense of nature's quiescence.

Most fundamentally, physical geographers are frequently seeking nature, not the relations or processes by which it absents itself from the plane of the earth's surface. Nancy highlights the problem with this perspective in stating: History is the infinite deferral of any nature, and this is why, from now on, the following question occurs to us: Was there ever 'nature', since there was history, and thus an indefinite deferral of any nature? Was there ever a 'prehistory', not only in the sense of a human prehistory, anterior to a history conceived and archived as such (the history contemporaneous with philosophy), but in the sense of a nonhuman prehistory, and even prior to life, a history of the world or of the Universe that had not already been always already historical in some way? (2007, 79) Biology, with its connection to evolution, is inti- mately aware of this incessant deferral, a deferral that is as much a material deconstruction as it is a construction. In contrast, such questions appear irrelevant to the task of most physical geographers even though these proddings get to the very heart of what nature is. An expanded conception of hybridity can perhaps help reform that gap. As an active agent in the process of deferral and absent- ing, as seen in behavioural adaptations and evolu- tionary developments that visibly outpace geological transformations, animals should be at the forefront of this disciplinary reshaping. Institutionally, the structures are not in place to advance this transition either. Among Anglophone geographers, several British researchers, such as Steve Hinchliffe, Lewis Holloway, Michael Woods, Henry Buller, Gail Davies, Gareth Enticott, Jamie Lorimer, Chris Philo and Sarah Whatmore, have delved most seriously into the topic of animals, but this has not translated into institutional reform, perhaps because these geographers have other research interests as well. Elsewhere, until recently, the specialty group within the Associa- tion of American Geographers (AAG) most suited to address ammalia was the biogeography spe- cialty group. Yet a quick perusal of the sessions sponsored by the specialty group at the AAG' s annual conferences indicates that the group's membership is primarily concerned with vegeta- tion and climate. This year an animal geography specialty group has been established in the AAG, but there is as yet no history there and the diverse interests of animal geographers have by no means coalesced around the theoretical impli- cations of hybridity specifically. This disciplinary void, which has deleterious consequences, would then appear to require the input of extra-disciplin- ary resources that could eventually arouse theoret- ical and institutional change. Acknowledging this gap could lead us to engage more strongly with the science of biology. The bio- logical 'wing' of the literature on hybridity has been generally unexplored by the human geogra- phers who have plumbed this topic. Hybridity, as a biological process, is well known to most lay peo- ple, geographers and those employed in the 'hard' scientific fields. In conventional conceptions, hybridity occurs when two distinct species engage, producing an organism of mixed ancestry. This is an adequate conception, but not sufficient for our purposes, however. The traditional biological conception is too nar- row, focusing solely on biotic interchange. For one, it does not include material exchanges with the abi- otic environment that involve only one biotic entity. Nor does it include mundane interactions among different species that do not involve inter- specific matings and the production of offspring, even though such physical interactions can alter each respective entity in the here and now. Nor does it relate at all to any conception of sociality and the interrelations among populations/species that may change that sociality, not only in the pres- ent generation but also in succeeding years to come. Overall, what a narrow biological définition does not recognise is that hybridity is more com- monly somatic (and even cognitive) than it is genetic. Consequently, biology needs geography as much as geography needs biology. A geographic sense of 'life in the mix', abstract and non-specific, yet pertinent to real lives, is needed. As Clark observes, Like it or not, every body relies on the generosity of other bodies, not only in the sense of what is corpore- ally bequeathed by parents and forbears, but also through that which is taken on by processes of imita- tion, or incorporated through the material transactions we have with others. (2007, 57) So while I want to reengage with the biological dis- cipline, it does not mean that geographers are beholden to them. This is out of their normal pur- view as well. Thus, it is perhaps best not to look at the entirety of the biological discipline, but to seg- ments that are currently marginalised or emergent, Trans Inst Br Geogr NS 34 378-393 2009 ISSN 0020-2754 © 2009 The Author.

On the one hand, this turbulence can be seen in theories regarding the promiscuous pro- clivities of bacteria and other life forms. Margulis and Sagan (2002) utilise the term symbiogenesis to suggest the role symbiosis has upon evolution via the joining of species. On the other hand, the influ- ence of nonhuman niche construction on evolution may be highly relevant (Sterelny 2005). Given these general options, I believe the abiotic elements of niche construction theory have more to offer geographers. The origins for thought on the evolutionary significance of niche construction emerged out of the literature on ecosystem engi- neers, but that literature was limited to the present ecological impact of nonhuman activities (Jones et al 1994 1997). Odling-Smee et al (2003) provide an analytical structure for rethinking evolution through niche construction, which has a more overt impact on the notion of nonhuman hybridity. They note that conventional evolutionary theory is too narrow for it acknowledges abiotic -&gt; biotic (i.e. selection) and biotic -&gt; biotic (i.e. competi- tion) interactions, but it does not account for biotic - &gt; abiotic or abiotic - » abiotic relations (which relate to the driving force of niche con- struction). They contend the semantic information contained in genes is translated into other biotic and abiotic materials through niche construction. Biotic organisms not only influence other biotic organisms directly, but also indirectly through abiotic artifacts, which they refer to as "bridges7. As Odling-Smee et al note: As a result the ecological consequences of natural selec- tion are no longer local, as characterized by standard evolutionary theory, but involve chains of events in which information-guided niche construction generates modified natural selection pressures and, in the process, accrues further information that guides additional niche construction. (2003, 195) Theoretical insights gleaned from philosophy can be garnered to further support these claims. Following Deleuze, Grosz (2007) claims that archi- tecture, and more specifically framing, is a founda- tional element of art, and that these framing propensities are shared by humans and nonhuman animals. From this perspective, niche construction is a form of framing, one moreover that produces intensities, sensations and affects. This theoretical formulation can be transferred back, in a more specific vein, to Sterelny et al, who observed that: Burrows bear information about burrowers and the next burrow generation. For burrows interact with their guests in ways that result in mutual changes. They and their guests coevolve. Chance changes in burrow copies can proliferate. A chance favourable burrow copying at a new and superior site - for example, one less liable to flood - may result in a bushy lineage of similarly chan- ged burrows. (1996, 397) Is the burrow not a form of framing that produces affect? As per Odling-Smee and colleagues, is this not a network that stretches across time and space that does not necessarily require the immediate presence of nonhuman (let alone human) animals? Most examinations of hybridity articulate the con- text, the networks, within which nonhumans find themselves. Here conversely, Sterelny's burrows indicate the context that nonhumans create for themselves (and for others, including humans). In a real sense, then, nonhumans are setting the stage for action. Ultimately, this affects a heterogeneous collection of entities, both now and in the future. What is seen here is that two general forms of nonhumanity, the corporeal and the non-corporeal, are of significance. More specifically, in their own hybrid relations with non-corporeality, the invested actions on nonhuman organisms are consequential, to themselves, other species and the intermediary of abiotic surroundings. As a whole, this non- humanity is un-unified unto itself. This expanded hybridity creates an entirely new dynamic that is more balanced than current geographic depictions of hybridity. Let me state then that there is a calculus to this perspective, one that entails a substantial redistri- bution of hybridity as it is commonly postulated in the geographic discipline. What I am trying to achieve here is an expansion of hybridity in the world, but one that is not reliant upon human hands. Latour (1993) has famously noted that modernity, which has repeatedly denied human- ity's relation to nonhumans, is increasingly reliant upon the proliferation of hybrids. While valid, this perspective portrays hybridity as a consumer of sorts in relation to the rest of the world. I would like to maintain the validity of Latour7 s sentiments, but simultaneously retain some space outside of human appropriation. In this vein, acknowledging hybridity among nonhumans in themselves increases the scope of hybridity and simultaneously diminishes the relative role of humans in the total field of hybridity.

Thickness is retained. Geographical considerations Let us then return to the three questions that opened this essay. As to the first question, the pre- ceding discussion has already shown that the par- lance of hybridity currently refers more to humans than to other entities. In truth, geographers are left to decide between the term's etymological roots (which have unwittingly plagued this concept) or current theoretical formulations. As Hinchliffe observes, 'hybrid' originally referred to the off- spring of a wild boar and tame sow, yet, in refer- ence to its present usage, he also notes that hybridity more fundamentally 'allows for change in all parties as they relate to one another' (2007, 51). Are geographers to stick to the original concep- tion, which emerged in the pre-Darwinian era and enshrined the nature-culture dichotomy that geog- raphers now strive so fervently to eradicate, or should they embrace Hinchliffe' s more basic prop- erty of relations irrespective of that divide? Natural scientists, steeped in Darwinian thought, are not impeded by hybridity' s etymological origin, though they may be hampered by a begrudging attitude toward 'social' impacts. Strangely, then, hybridity may lead us back to some conventional (and I would add productive) science. In this vein, I might also refer to Haraway's trickster, which is sourced in traditional thinking, but which could be quite beneficial to theoretical thought. In response to my proposal for a heightened attention to biology, it may be argued that such dynamics have become too detached from 'hybrid- ity' (as geographers know it) and thus the term should not be used in such a manner. This seems unwarranted for a few basic reasons. The worst option available is to cede these dynamics to biolo- gists and thus reassert 'nature' through abstention. Another option is to generate a neologism, but these are difficult to propagate given the orthodox- ies of society and its institutions. Indeed, the suc- cess of 'hybridity' in geography may stem from the fact that it was not an entirely new term, but was instead borrowed from other academic disciplines. The pervasiveness of the term is thus a benefit and a constraint. On the other hand, the third option, that of enlarging the scope of the term, is prefera- ble not simply because it is the most expedient, but because, in materialist terms, it is the option most consistent with the inherent properties of emerging theories themselves. In speaking of impurities, hybridity can provide no lecture to nature, which has excelled in the production of these formations. Additionally, this reconceptualisation has several disciplinary benefits. From a more pragmatic per- spective, as noted above, this reconfiguration of hybridity can function as a lynchpin that brings human and physical geography closer together (though not in a unity). Despite the proliferation of hybrid thinking in geography, the current utilisa- tion of hybridity will not bring together the two major wings of the discipline, because it has already proven itself to be selective. It has nothing (or at best very little) to offer physical geographers. With regard to the second question posed at the outset of this paper, I contend the currently skewed conception of hybridity directly undermines the theoretical soundness of poststructuralism. Post- structuralism has different facets, some of which are overtly inclusive of materiality (e.g. Deleuze, Serres, in addition to Latour and Haraway), but the dominant aspect has focused on textuality, discourse and the visual (see Darier (1999) on Foucault). This tendency can even be seen in Derrida's (2002) estimations of his cat, which largely accentuates the importance of the gaze and categorical considerations. That emphasis on language always remained structured due to the perceived centrality of language in the emergence of humanity (Corbey 2005), no matter the fluidity of meaning and interpretation. Conversely, by perceiving hybridity within nat- ure itself, and not only between nature and society, a more complete sense of poststructuralism is actu- alised. Geographers would then be truthful to our own theoretical allegiances. The underhanded cow- bird, which insinuates its own eggs into the life of another and absolves itself of further work, is an appropriate example of the shiftiness I want to accentuate, though innovative nonhuman processes need not be harmful or destructive. Moreover, this is not to suggest geographers become preoccupied with 'biological' or other concerns, but to realise that such processes, occasionally separate from us in time and space, may periodically resurface into 'our' relations. To be precise, however, unlike wil- derness, the locale of these forms of nonhuman hybridity is not necessarily distant from humans, for these hybridisations can occur within our midst without our being a participant.

This acknowledgement of nonhuman hybridity must be done in a way that does not 'black-box7 nature by treating prior forms of hybridity as incon- sequential to human engagements. This would deny, once again, any thickness to the world. More to the point, muting the speed and power of evolu- tionary processes is only one means by which thin- ning is achieved - it is also achieved by the indirect means of relegating those nonhuman actions to other academic disciplines. Thus characterised, the sentiments noted here entail no invalidation of the more frequent theoretical use of hybridity in geog- raphy. Rather, this is a qualification, one that has the additional benefit of acknowledging that humans have not entirely appropriated the world. Lastly, in regard to my third major question, I want to point to the more traditional concern of geography, which is the basic ability to represent the landscape and the larger world. Given the pre- ceding considerations, it is fair to ask whether geographers can reasonably depict the character of landscapes and the world more generally without accounting for the hybrid characteristics of nature in itself. Although there are limits to representation (textually and cartographically), some limits are self-induced and unnecessary. A movement toward an invigorated hybridity would undoubtedly bol- ster this disciplinary capacity. The language and emphasis of non-representa- tional theory may be helpful (Thrift 2008). I am not talking about mapping per se, for hybridisation is more about potentiality than a determination of the real. Rather, geographers may benefit from the notion of performance. As McCormack (2002) has shown, performance can generate very interesting spatialities. Thrift notes that the meaning of perfor- mance has broadened out over the years, gradually moving being the self-conscious portrayals of drama to incorporate the more mundane aspects of life. Even though Thrift's conception of non-representa- tional theory doesn't deal explicitly with animality, it is helpful here since it conceptualises the role of knowledge, affect and power by assessing the inter- actions of bodies. Performance also connects with Haraway's thematic appropriation of the trickster. By no means do I want to suggest that non- representational theory can, or should, replace hybridity, but it does distribute agency in a manner different from hybridity. Unlike hybridity, perfor- mance is more readily acknowledged to take place among animals in themselves. Haraway's trickster recalls the deviousness of performance, but nonhu- mans of many diverse species 'perform' for a vari- ety of reasons. Performances embody a type of knowledge and are geared toward a number of activities, including mating (Carosi and Visalberghi 2002), self-defence (Stephens 1984), territoriality (Watt and Joss 2003) and play (Petit et al 2008). They may involve intricate movements of the face (Burrows 2008), manipulations of the entire body (Langbauer 2000; Pika et al 2003; Mather and Mather 2004), or the incorporation of materials from the surrounding environment (Polo and Veiga 2006). Although directed, such performances may bring about unexpected hybridities, since animals are frequently in the presence of multiple beings. This brings about complexity. For example, Cruz et al (1989) note that the visual mating displays of the yellow-hooded blackbird may simultaneously make it easier for the aforementioned cowbird to locate breeding birds and their nests, and thereby parasitise them. It is important to remember that these perfor- mances are fundamentally corporeal, express an uncertain and changing form of knowledge, and thus bear a tenuous relationship to cognition and functionality. There is often a need to repeat these performances, and thus they are not only a means of communication but also a means of learning and knowing through the body. As such, these prac- tices extend beyond functionality and can be a pro- ductive form of hybridity. As observers, geographers may gather a sense of the multidimensionality of these performances by taking a figurative snapshot of nonhuman animals in interaction, during a moment of pause, when it is unclear as to whether the animal is playing or has become serious. This process can be quite compli- cated, for as Palagi et al note: When animals play fight, they use patterns of agonistic functional contexts. Since these actions are not intrinsi- cally different from their 'serious' context, it may be hard to distinguish them. Many animals solved this problem by evolving some signals that have the func- tion of establishing and/or maintaining a playful mood. (2007, 440) In these pauses, the animal is like Star and Griese- mer's (1989) 'boundary object', potentially able to exist in a frivolous or fighting world, or like Trans Inst Br Geogr NS 34 378-393 2009 ISSN 0020-2754 © 2009 The Author.

In either case, it need not matter that I am there, for these perfor- mances, which are a type of hybridity, can exist without me. As such, given the multiplicitousness of the engagements, I will wager on the theoretical value of the trickster in any battle against the cyborg. Above all, these cautionary words seek to resub- stantiate hybridity in a way that is beneficial to a wide range of entities. I hope, in utilising hybridity in this way, to 'confront the very real problem of defining political subjects in a world where the boundaries between humans and non-humans are hard to discern' (Castrée 2003 2007). Presently, hybridity in geography undersells the forms of hybridity that are active in the world. Geographers need to be able to represent that world in a better fashion. By remaining aware of hybridity' s thick- ness and depth, geographers can retain a better sense of the earth. Notes 1 By no means do I wish to suggest in choosing animals that hybridity is delimited by the actions of animals, for the chemical world illustrates hybridisations in abundance. Rather, I am focusing on biological exam- ples for they provide a best means to grasp hybrid- ity' s presence in the nonhuman world and to sense our own theoretical limitations. 2 Whatmore (2002, 165) previously used the term 'resid- ual humanism' to convey the lingering presence of humanism within efforts to extend ethical obligations to nature. Here the term is used differently, namely to convey the pervasive presence of humans within the literature on hybridity.
