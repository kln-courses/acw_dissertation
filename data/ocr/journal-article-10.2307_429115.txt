<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHARLES HARTSHORNE The Aesthetics of Birdsong BEAUTY IS THE CENTRAL, though not the only, aesthetic value. It is the mean between extremes. On one side are mere disorder, confusion, chaos, unexpectedness, uninte- grated diversity, on the other, mere order, regularity, predictability, unity without diversity. Beauty is the blessed escape from the opposite evils of monotonous or mechanical repetition and an equally meaningless succession of unrelated nov- elties. If we deviate-but not hopelessly far-from the mean of beauty toward chaos we get the tragic or comic rather than the beautiful; if we deviate-but not hopelessly far-toward mere regularity we get the neat or tidy rather than the beauti- ful. There is another form of deviation. In comedy as in tragedy, there is disorder or conflict. However, the difference be- tween these two deviants from the mean of beauty is along another dimension than that of order versus disorder. This is the dimension of depth, including degree of complexity and intensity. A profound dis- order is tragic, a superficial one, comic; a profound beauty tends toward the sub- lime, a superficial beauty, toward the merely pretty. On both dimensions, (1) chaos versus monotony, (2) the profound versus the superficial, beauty is the golden mean, balanced between excess of unity and excess of variety, between excess of depth and excess of superficiality. Devia- tions from this golden mean, if not too CHARLES HARTSHORNE is Ashbel Smith professor of philosophy at the University of Texas. He has published ten books and about 300 articles, eleven of them in ornithological journals, including the Auk (U.SA.), Emu (Australia), and Ibis (England). extreme, still have value. Accordingly, there are other aesthetic values than beauty (using the word in its most natural or narrower meaning), but still it remains the ideal, the center, of the aesthetically valuable.l Birdsong is a fine illustration of beauty of an unprofound sort (by human stand- ards). For human ears it is pretty rather than sublime. Sometimes it seems a bit chaotic, sometimes rather monotonous, but seldom hopelessly either. Its essential dif- ference from human music is its far greater simplicity. Taken temporally, as music must be, the mean between order and disorder has to consist chiefly in a mixture of the ex- pected and the unexpected. This is exactly what birdsong gives us, sometimes on a surprisingly complex or almost complex level. At one extreme we have a simple, short song pattern (perhaps a mere trill or a monotonic repetition) reiterated hundreds or thousands of times in a day. Where, you may wonder, is the unex- pectedness? Is this not sheer monotony? The answer is found in the pauses between reiterations which normally characterize this kind of singing. The pauses are generally several-in some species five, ten, or more-times the length of the songs. The pauses are also irregular in length, so that the timing of the next utterance is always somewhat unpredictable rather than mechanically regular. Even more im- portant is the considerable length of the pauses. Monotony in the psychological sense depends upon memory; the faster vivid memory fades, the sooner a repeti-</page><page sequence="2">312 tion is possible without monotony. There are good reasons for attributing a very short memory span to a bird, indeed to any non-human animal. For this reason alone birdsong must largely escape monot- ony for the birds themselves. Moreover, it is not normally very monotonous even to us, with our far longer span of vivid memory. Now consider the opposite extreme, a species in which each individual has many contrasting little songs or phrases, some- times as many as fifty or even more. These may be sung in either of two ways: the repetitive way, in which an item from the repertoire is reiterated a number of times, perhaps ten or twenty, and then another item is introduced and repeated, and then another; or the non-repetitive way, in which the bird sings item a, then item b, then c, then perhaps a again, then d, or d and e, then back say to c, then f, then b, until finally the repertoire is exhausted. I say perhaps, because there is no predict- able order. The crucial fact, however, is that with the repetitive type of singing pauses are relatively long, much longer than the songs, while with the non-repeti- tive type they are short or scarcely notice- able at all. The mockingbird is the perfect example, or the European skylark, of this non-repetitive continuous style of singing. That pauses lengthen with the degree of repetition and shorten with degree of im- mediate variety is exactly what aesthetic principles call for. The fact itself is not seriously disputed, though I discovered it without a hint from any other ornitholo- gist. Nor has any other explanation been offered in the twelve years since I pub- lished my ideas on the subject. The basic difference between human music and bird music is the incomparably greater time span of the former. "Man is the time-binding animal," to quote Kor- zybski's best epigram. No bird can master a definite pattern lasting more than a few seconds. After that it either pauses and then repeats the pattern, or it moves on to a different pattern, the succession of pat- terns conforming to no definite overall pattern. The short time-span of birds ap- pears also in the brevity of the sentences CHARLES HARTSHORNE learned by parrots and talking mynas. A human musician can follow a pattern oc- cupying an hour; a bird has patterns oc- cupying seconds, i.e., 3600ths of an hour! Only astronomical figures could express the difference in complexity of relation- ships which follow from this difference. True, birds almost certainly live and, in their sense of "think," think faster than we do, but the vast difference in com- plexity is only moderately diminished by this fact. Granted the brevity of the patterns and the short span of vivid memory, birdsong is recognizably musical by all basic human standards. It has nice bits of melody, charming rhythms, even bits of harmony (for birds, unlike us, can sing contrasting notes simultaneously); it has obvious ex- amples of theme with variations, neat ex- amples of accelerando and rallentando, crescendo and diminuendo, interval in- version, even change of key and tempo contrasts, as, for instance, when the same pattern, e.g., a trill, is given at half or double speed. The longer one studies the songs (and this has happened particularly to observers with musical training), the more one finds that a birdsong is a simple piece of music, in some cases extremely rudimentary music, but in others astonish- ingly sophisticated, considering the limita- tions of the bird brain. I am convinced that the better singers put about as much intelligence, or whatever you call that which is more than mere instinct, into their singing as into anything they do. And recent studies attribute somewhat more intelligence to birds than anato- mists or comparative psychologists used to do. They are closer to mammals in this respect than we once thought. Looking over the animal kingdom, what is the situation with regard to the rise of music? The oldest forms of anything like music on this planet are found in the insects and the batrachians. The former have no melody, for the simple reason that they cannot discriminate pitches, but they have unmistakable rhythm, which is enough to constitute a kind of music, as in human drumming. The temporal span, of course, is very short, even as compared</page><page sequence="3">The Aesthetics of Birdsong to birds, except that in some cicadas there are songs lasting about thirty seconds. This apparent exception does not upset the rule, for in these cases the patterns are somewhat indefinite. There may be a vague division into two or three parts, say a soft beginning, a loud climax, and a diminuendo ending, or a first part with one indefinitely repeated phrase and a second part with a different repeated phrase, but otherwise no determinate over- all pattern. In some striking cases, at least, the avoidance of monotony is apparent, as in katydids, which vary the number of repetitions of a phrase between two and five or more, just as birds often do. This "juggling of numbers," as I call it, is one simple way of achieving variety. Batrachians seem to have the beginnings of pitch and hence of melody, though I do not know if they have been tested for pitch discrimination. The geckoes, large lizards, have the most definite patterns, though their voices are crude in the ex- treme. Neither batrachians nor insects can compare with birds as musicians. Nor can any mammals, though the smallest ape, the gibbon, has a song comparable to a mediocre birdsong. A basic test of musical feeling, or of interest in sounds as such, is the tendency to imitate sounds. Songbirds very generally, probably universally, have this tendency. Parrots also have it, and are seldom par- ticularly musical; but this proves little since parrots lack physical organs to sing well with. In the technical anatomical sense they are not songbirds. A few wild parrots are mildly musical and some tame parrots have learned short tunes, as have mynas (which are true songbirds). If it is correct to speak of insects singing, and students of these creatures do use this term, they should have some capacity to imitate what they hear, and in fact they do have itl Several species have been in- duced to alter their rhythms. I was inclined to predict that this could be done, but failed to publish my suspicion. It only remains to learn if batrachians can be in- duced to modify their patterns by hearing slightly divergent ones. There is one report of a gibbon ape imitating a dog's bark. 313 Ages ago, insects, frogs, toads, lizards, then birds, and finally, after a long inter- val, man, emerged as musicians. What re- lation is there between man's music and that of his predecessors? No doubt of it, quite an important relation. Man could not help learning about music from the animal music that had been a going con- cern long before he came on the scene. Primitive man was far closer than we to the other musical animals; he heard them much more constantly and with less inter- ference from non-musical noises, such as the roar of traffic, the pounding of ma- chinery, the shouting of crowds, and many others. More than that, primitive man imputed magical powers to those medicine men who learned to imitate the calls or songs of birds, which shows that the latter were by no means viewed with indifference. There is in addition a special anatomical reason why birds, rather than man, would stumble almost automatically into melody and harmony, while man might have to have the example before him to get the idea. The bird's vibrating organ, the syrinx, is not a set of cords in the wind- pipe but the windpipe itself, manipulated to alter pitch and timbre by special mus- cles used just for this end. Thus the bird has a sort of built-in flute, and this is the very instrument in which harmonic over- tones occur most easily or strikingly. I do not understand the physics of this, but a Hungarian expert on both music and birds has published a study which stresses the point.2 Birds are anatomically more mu- sical than man. Only their brain limita- tions prevent them from doing symphonies or concertos. In agreement with the birds' built-in musicality is the fact that young birds play at making musical sounds, as small children play at making speech-like sounds. Human offspring are instinctive vowel and consonant utterers, i.e., talkers, but birds are instinctive musicians. They are the only instinctive musicians with any complexity of pattern. Yet their music is not merely instinctive, since they improve considerably with practice, and also by hearing the performance of others. Man of course is incomparably more imitative</page><page sequence="4">CHARLES HARTSHORNE than any other kind of animal. He learns chiefly by observing the actions of others. So of course he has learned to make rhythmical and melodious sounds, partly by observing the birds. The major mystery of man is not how he came to make music, but how he came to talk, in a sense in which no other animal talks at all. The simple elements of music are all in birdsong, but the sim- ple elements of speech are not, in any comparable degree, in so-called animal language. Language implies parts of speech and implicit grammatical rules. There is no such thing in animal communication. It is all nouns, or all verbs, or all ex- pletives. There are no meaningful elements combined according to implicit rules in ways that are themselves meaningful. Even the most complex of birdsongs is not a series of sentences each saying something different and adding up to a paragraph. Not at all. The whole song, and any ade- quately recognized part of it, announces the presence in a certain small area, the "territory," of a member of a certain species of bird, indicating also its sex, individual identity (in many cases), breed- ing condition to some extent, readiness to defend its territory against rivals; for most singers-and all the best-are territorial, and of course, the song reveals desire for a mate or, if the bird already has one, its tendency to maintain the pair bond. But the whole song says this, not as a sum of distinct meanings each attaching to some one part of the song; rather, the parts have no separate meanings, except so far as, by their style, they betray the specific, sexual, or individual identity or condition of the singer. It is like recognizing Mozart by a longer or shorter portion of one of his compositions. In the bird case, once recognition is effected, the whole message is conveyed. Further singing merely keeps it alive, or adds emphasis. Some species, physically equipped to sing well, and of course with normal need for a mate, sing poorly or not at all, but these are non-territorial, and/or they are species whose coloration and habits make them visually conspicuous. They can easily be seen to be present, and even their sex and breeding condition may be visually obvious. Song is the auditory substitute for all this. To compare it with speech is hardly enlightening. The comparison with music is closer. Because the parts have no separate denotative meaning, they can be combined simply in terms of how well they sound together, or how interesting and distinctive the auditory effect is. Granted a distinctive, interesting, readily recognized and remembered pattern or style, the message will be conveyed. This is not how sentences function. Their parts have their own meanings, largely retained in diverse combinations. But the various parts of a complex birdsong all say the same thing, if they say anything, namely, "Here I am, a mockingbird-or a brown thrasher-male, engaged in seeking or keeping a mate and warning intruding members of the same or even related species that the area is not open to them." The human analogy is with music. Thus a street vendor may play or sing a little tune so that he will be recognized as the kind of vendor he is, eager to sell such and such. The street vendor falls into the habit of announcing himself more or less musically because musical sounds are more readily made distinctive, recognizable, and memorable, and the activity is easier to maintain through long hours or days (as birds maintain their singing) if it has some intrinsic aesthetic character or pattern. Aldous Huxley, and some ornithologists, reacting against the sentimentalism of older naturalists, fall into a new kind of anthropomorphism when they go to the opposite extreme from those who rhapso- dized about the sweet birds praising God, or their mates, or expressing their joy in life, with their singing. The new version has the bird saying, "Get out, actual or potential intruder, or I'll peck your eyes out"-or something of the sort. This is perhaps something like part of the mes- sage, but only part. There is also the re- lation to the mate, which is very different. And no known facts conflict with the idea that the bird enjoys its singing, and much of the time is not worrying particularly about rivals at all. What then is it feeling? Why not, "Here am I in this lovely 314</page><page sequence="5">The Aesthetics of Birdsong territory, a marvelous creature, competent to deal with any need or challenge, hoping to acquire a mate, or equipped with a fine one, with plenty of food available, interesting responsibilities of nest build- ing, mate-tending, or young-incubating." This language is indeed anthropomorphic, but so is any attempt to put bird feelings into words. Julian Huxley, who has some distinction as an ornithologist, would never have been so crudely one-sided as Aldous in his book on Poetry and Science. I know this in part from correspondence with Julian, though his letters were 315 written too long ago to take his brother's book into account. I believe that the older sentimentalism in some respects was closer to reality than the new cynicism, and that both should be taken with several grains of salt. 1For the ideas of this paragraph I am partially indebted to Max Dessoir and to Kay Davis (Mrs. Ivor Leclerc). 2 P.
