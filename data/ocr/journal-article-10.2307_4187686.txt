<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cape Colonial Architecture, Town Planning, and the Crafting of Modern Space in South Africa Shannon M. Jackson Architecture and the built environment in Cape Town pro- vide clues and insight into the spatial models that inform continuities and contradictions in the structuring of rules regulating contact and conduct in urban dwellers' daily routines. This paper explores the transition from classical to modernist space in colonial and postcolonial Cape Town to address some of the tensions informing the use of race and gender distinctions to obscure the relations of produc- tion behind the organization of domestic space. It is argued that the transcendent nature of classical space is sustained in the modernist moment, but is obscured, in part, through the abstraction of rules separating public and private spheres of the body and the built environment. Transcendence is shifted from the divine to the secular through the incorpora- tion of scientific principles of efficiency and hygiene into the definition and building of proper working-class housing. Despite all the techniques for appropriating space, despite the whole network of knowledge that enables us to delimit or to formalize it, contemporary space is perhaps still not entirely desanctified. (Foucault 1986:23) Introduction With the dismantling of apartheid and the reconfiguration of spatial bound- aries in South Africa, urban space has become a newly contested and newly privileged domain of inquiry. The apartheid regime had once claimed South African cities as distinctly its own, but other, more marginalized, groups are now enjoying new opportunities to control the occupation and development of cities. Nevertheless, despite changes in the navigation and the represen- tation of urban space, and despite open contestation over the boundaries</page><page sequence="2">associated with belonging and entitlement, many forms of urban spatial segregation remain firmly in place. Concern about the future of the urban-built environment has inspired inquiry into the historical foundations of urban planning and reform, inquiry that provides insight into some of the depth and sustainability of urban segregation (Mabin 1998; Parnell 1993; Pinnock 1989; Robinson 1992). The continuities that emerge in colonial, apartheid, and even post- apartheid strategies of urban planning and development suggest elements of a shared model of space, and further suggest a relationship to space that conceals the social relations of its production. Space, as a historically and socially constructed set of boundaries, can be analyzed in terms of the models that evolve out of the constant navigation between social groups and the built environment. A historical understanding of such models leads us to the cultural context of beliefs informing spatial practice and therefore to some of the hidden assumptions behind the proper ordering of space or objects in space. Most analyses of the built environment in South Africa put space in the analytical background: colonialism, apartheid, and segregation appear to unfold against an assumed relation to space. Jennifer Robinson, in her book The Power of Apartheid (1996) does link space with power to explore the apartheid regime's strategies of geographic order, but fails to demon- strate how modernist space itself informed the carefully documented con- flict and lack of agreement she locates at the state level. The following will weave together archaeological, archival, and architectural sources from the colonial and early postcolonial periods in Cape Town to establish some of the contradictions, conflicts, and continuities informing a particular and historically constructed relationship to space. The model of space that will be examined unfolds around tensions erupting during South Africa's transition from Dutch to British control. Post-emancipation Cape Town, as it made the further transition to indus- trial production, became rhetorically cast as a particularly disordered and degraded city. Poverty, disease, and crime in the colonies became imbricated with strategies to strengthen and secure a vulnerable British national iden- tity and protect it from racial degradation. There are many rich and descrip- tive historical narratives of nineteenth-century Cape Town (Bickford-Smith 2001; Cartwright 1978; Ross 1999; Swanson 1977; Van Heyningen 1984), and though many of these narratives vividly address the ways in which British settlers became consumed with order and regulation, the spatial model informing their practices and beliefs is not considered. What is missing from the broader narrative is an analysis of the spatial model that was being constructed as early settlers and later municipal authorities and reformers grappled with the disorder associated with colonialism and rapid urbanization. This model was not just a functional response to historical disruption: it was also an extension of the classical model, inherited from a previous era. p- -o 0 a 0 m z 5 r- n I - m c m</page><page sequence="3">According to Foucault (1986), classical or medieval space was charac- terized by a taxonomic hierarchy of places. A vital component of the clas- sical model was the belief that space is a type of empty container, uniform and continuous, infinitely divisible into standardizing elements like grids and algorithms, but its ultimate order was out of the reach of human hands. All objects had a proper and sanctified place within the container, and could be made to correspond visually to the abstract principles that gave space its dimensionality. Patterns thus emerged, intrinsically linking particular objects to each other, and particular types of bodies and behaviors were associated with particular places. Scientific discoveries, by showing that space is infinite and objects in space lack stability, disrupted this model. Industrialization, by the same token, disrupted the naturally ordered bound- aries of kinship, community, and the terrestrial moorings of the human body. These disruptions combined to destabilize the relationship between subjects and an objective world ordered by a transcendent pattern. The newly perceived possibilities for human interference and the lack of stable boundaries introduced new ways for human beings to appropriate space; however, prior order cannot simply be erased, and disorder is not something social agents embrace with alacrity. The model of governance being developed in nineteenth-century England was based on liberal principles of individualism and contract. This meant that softer, less coercive mechanisms than those of previous genera- tions, were being sought as sources of order (Foucault 1991, 1995): bodies that challenged traditional boundaries could not simply be coerced back into their proper places. According to Lewis Mumford, it is the laissez-faire politics of Utilitarianism that informs the conceptualization of space in early industrial Europe; Utilitarianism is the expectation that "the effects of rational design" will "appear from the unrestricted operation of conflict- ing random private interests" (1961:454). For colonial administrators faced with unsettled and unsettling frontiers and cities that proliferated plague, crime, and runaway speculation, laissez-faire was not a practical option, and Utilitarianism did not resolve many of the debates about what constituted proper or efficient state interference. Edward Soja (1989) has pointed out that few things hide their rela- tions of production like space. The spatial model to be described here becomes hegemonic, in part, when its purported nature is refracted into the invisible domains and distinctions of the human body. Feminist theorists have argued that "spatial questions are fundamentally gendered" (Levine 2003:298). Others insist that race is an inherently spatial phenomenon. According to John and Jean Comaroff, "The hard facts of organic existence, of the ineffable chain of biological being, had come to determine the place of men in the world" (1992:218). Frantz Fanon's analysis of colonial sub- jectivity (1967) is posited in terms of Manichean delirium, the unstable spatial separation of interior and exterior-the invisible and the visible. Levine demonstrates, more specifically, that for British colonialists, gender, -A 0 w U, I z 0 z 0 )z w z</page><page sequence="4">race, and geography are inseparable categories (2003). Race and gender both become historically and spatially linked to distinctions of the visible and the invisible as separate sites of truth. The inclusion of the invisible and interior of the human body as a site and source of truth, however, made for a great deal of uncertainty, particu- larly as visualization was being privileged as the mechanism for revealing the nature of interior space. Industrialization and wage labor offered women and former slaves a type of freedom that further intensified uncertainty about their "proper" place (Scully 1997; Wilson 1991): "The sexual dangers of the metropolis encompassed more than the possibility of sexual assault or of being kidnapped; crucially, they included the possible consequences of women's engaging their own sexuality" (Woollacott 1999:53). A woman who wandered out of her proper place, or engaged in behavior in a place it did not properly belong, exhibited a particularly alarming weakness of character. For many British colonial theorists, female prostitution is emblematic of the boundary confusion and disruption justifying some of the most deliberate attempts to interfere in the spatial order (Walkowitz 1992): "It was vital for colonial rule that British and native spaces be distinct, and that respectable and dangerous environments be clearly separated, just as it was necessary to distinguish among prostitute women" (Levine 2003:306). Women also challenged the centralized control of early town planning efforts by positioning themselves on the front lines of urban sanitary reform (Burton 1999; Levine 2004). According to Anne McClintock, the domestic habits of women became intimately linked, as a result, to the policing of vulnerable colonial boundaries: As colonials traveled back and forth across the thresholds of their known world, crisis and boundary confusion were warded off and contained by ... absolution rituals and lim- inal scenes. Soap and cleaning rituals became central to the demarcation of body boundaries. (1995:33) Ann Laura Stoler makes a compelling case for combining race and the hidden realities of human sexuality to address the role of colonialism in the cultivation of a rather anxious bourgeois subject: If the truth of ourselves has been construed to reside in our deep sexual desires, and it is race that has been construed to differentiate who has what desires, then the sorts of knowl- edge produced about the bourgeois self in a European imperial world must be seen in a grid of intelligibility that includes both. (1995:206) Neither race nor gender, then, can be separately privileged as providing the sine qua non of colonial justification; both concepts are entangled in the spa- tial, and therefore naturalizing, alibi of both colonialism and modernism. 0 -I 0 w a C' m -o n 0 0 z I C- H m m</page><page sequence="5">It can thus be argued that some of the contradictions of modernist space are refracted onto the essentialist distinctions drawn between bodies that are differentially capable of the proper separation of their own public and private realms. Colonial agents in Cape Town contributed to an expand- ing separation of public and private as separate sources of truth and spatial order. This paper examines some of the strategies employed in Cape Town which respond to changes in the social construction of space, particularly in terms of the contradictory role of a new knowing subject whose agency unfolds against a spatial model firmly rooted in transcendent order. Space and the Ordering of Things An important aspect of the transition from a classical to a modern notion of space is the changing importance of visualization and human perception: What begins in the 1820s and 1830s is a repositioning of the observer, outside of the fixed relations of interior/exterior ... and into an undemarcated terrain on which the distinction between internal sensation and external signs is irrevocably blurred. (Crary 1992:24) By privileging the visual, the sensory or empirical, as well as a particular model of mind, the invisible patterns governing space were rendered acces- sible; but, by the same token, positioning human perception as a key ele- ment in understanding and manipulating spatial order meant the source of information itself was pluralized, and introduced the problem of indetermi- nacy and debate about strategies of intervention and appropriation. Mary Poovey describes the transition to modernist space as occurring out of the disaggregation of conceptual and spatial domains, so that space is rendered purely abstract: "Despite its dependence on the labor of literal bodies, modern abstraction tended to deemphasize or eliminate bodies as objects of analysis and as the authoritative basis of personal experience" (1995:31). This means the body provides the sensing mechanism by which objects become real, but the subjective source of that meaning is elimi- nated. One way to accomplish this is to render space abstract, and to render the spatial depth of the body as ordered prior to human perception. Certain bodies, then, are thought to be too locked in their own corporeality to abstract away from observable form; they are unable to establish authorita- tive links between interior and exterior. In other words, human intervention and subjective experience became part of a privileged body, one capable of abstracting perception away from its own embodiment. According to the eighteenth-century spatial philosophy developed by Leibniz, we cannot gain direct knowledge of space, since we cannot see it: "Rather, the best that we can do is infer its existence from the things that we really do see, namely, objects" (Curry 1998:27). This notion prevails -I 0 V z z 0 z 0 - z</page><page sequence="6">into the modern era and reinforces the development of an indifferent medical gaze that can be trained to plumb surfaces in order to examine and diagnose sources of pathology. Embodied observation, however, had to be concretely performed under the guise of a detached, medical, and thus neutral gaze. The Comaroffs further suggest that British colonialism in Africa was "inseparable from the rise of biomedicine in science" (1992:215). Thus, according to Poovey, "Identifying personal inspection and scientific method as the qualifications that authorize certain people to interfere in the interior lives of the poor legitimizes the efforts of medical scientists to participate in social reform" (1995:86). As an instrument of urban reform, the indifferent and privileged medical gaze had to be balanced out by a body uniquely equipped to per- form more corporeal forms of labor. As remarks from Cape Town Medical Officer of Health T. S. Higgins illustrate, it became the respectable woman's natural mission to build ideal cities by building ideal homes; where medical experts and government officials insinuated themselves into the public and collective sphere of decision-making, she could apply herself to the more intimate sphere of the individual household and her own sexuality, as well as that of her children: The factors which are concerned in the public health [of Cape Town] are numerous. They include, for instance, external circumstances over which the individual citizen has but little control and which are dealt with by the community as a whole, such as the provision of systems of pure water supply; and also matters which depend on the initiative and character of the individual, such as domestic cleanliness, personal hygiene, the nurture of children, and temperance. (Higgins 1924:9) Protection of the private and intimate spheres thus required more than just an informed mind: it also required a sympathetic body. The respectable woman provided, in a sense, the softer form of coercion being sought by liberal reformers. The Cape Monthly Magazine, a popular nineteenth-cen- tury publication, offered an article in its June 1860 issue titled "Women and Their Uses!" Reviewing Florence Nightingale's Notes on Nursing (1859), it explores the "proper and correct" uses of women's energies and extols the virtue of following Nightingale's prescription on how to maintain a healthy household (Cape Monthly Magazine 1860). White South African women were called on to make use of scientific principles by putting their bodies to work in the eradication of the "two-headed enemy: Dirt and Darkness" (Nightingale 1859:6). Nightingale worked to resolve the contradiction of scientific principles evolving alongside a transcendent yet elusive spatial order: "We should hear no longer of mysterious dispensations, nor of 'plague and pestilence' being in God's hands, when, so far as we know, He has put them into our own" (1859:26).

Human tinkering with the spatial interiority and living conditions of others contradicted, in part, the spatial model colonial administrators had inherited from the classical era. By obscuring the relations of its production, however, modernism can appear as if the order it crafts and contrives is one of nature, rather than culture. In some respects, nature replaces the divine as the transcendent source of order, and science replaces religion as the mechanism linking the human with the divine. An architecture that lays bare its inhabitants and then orders their habits and daily lives according to scientific principles of order and boundary maintenance provides, by the same token, governance without the sting of coercion (Foucault 1991). Such an architecture is further informed by beneficent expertise, an expertise focused on balancing the needs of individual bodies with the health needs of the larger society; it is both secular and moral. How can Cape Town's built environment, and more specifically, its architecture, be used to investigate the spatial model that was evolving out of a contradiction between human agency and transcendent order? Cape colonial architecture is an under-researched component of Cape history. Scholarly attention has concentrated less on vernacular and design and more on the deliberate manipulation of the built environment and organiza- tion of urban space as coercive instruments for social control. Recent analy- sis of probate records and archaeological evidence, however, suggests that Cape colonial domestic architecture, particularly that dating to the transi- tion from Dutch to British rule at the turn of the nineteenth-century, offers important clues to placing the role of gender and the more tacit, intimate domain of the household within a model of space premised on "gentler" forms of coercion and control. The change in domestic colonial architecture is in some respects analogous to the reform of nineteenth-century prisons described by Foucault: "The heaviness of the old 'houses of security', with their fortress-like architecture, could be replaced by the simple, economic geometry of a 'house of certainty"' (1995:202). Changes that occurred in the organization and meaning of domestic space among early British settlers create new levels of comfort with move- ment and contact, as well as new associations of morality with particular spatial arrangements within the house. Because these spatial arrangements mimic European urban trends, the model suggests that urbanization in general inspired new ways to interpret the relationship between space and the objects and bodies that fill it, but colonial cities intensified the need for new spatial arrangements and provided opportunities for experimentation that were not available in older European cities (Rabinow 1989). The design and organization of space in Cape Town can be historically and materially p; 0 w I z z 0 z n 0 z</page><page sequence="8">documented by means of extant structures, artifacts, probate records, per- sonal journals, and official archives. The following description will focus on shifts in the meaning and organization of domestic architecture occurring among British settlers responding to changes in the economic and political organization of nineteenth-century Europe. It has been said that the "relation of people to houses is also one of contained to container so that the contrast between body and house can be made to relate to differences in scale and relations of encompassment between the individual and society or between levels of social grouping" (Carsten and Hugh-Jones 1995:42). In this sense, the house in nineteenth- century Cape Town became fundamentally linked to the idea that private domestic space should separate and govern the movement of individual bodies and facilitate new standards of time management. According to Timothy Mitchell, "If modern political authority was to work through the forming and disciplining of 'character,' the individual household, it fol- lowed, had to be transformed into a site of this discipline" (1991:112). But the earliest changes to domestic architecture occurred without the coher- ent vision of professional planning; many of them were a diffuse response to the traditional styles established by an earlier colonial order, a desire to reverse or challenge prior aesthetics. We can characterize this period as one of experimentation with different strategies of intervention into the daily routines of city dwellers. Two basic periods of change will be described in the gradual transi- tion to modernism as a vernacular element in domestic architecture in Cape Town. These phases were increasingly focused on the building of "Functional Houses for Frictionless Living" (Evans 1997). We can speculate that early experimentation was with strategies that would reduce conflict and dangerous contamination within and between bodies living in close or intimate contact. Of course this was never fully achieved, and proved to be a continuous and ongoing challenge. For the first period, the late eighteenth, early nineteenth century, the larger cultural transition is from Dutch to British, from medieval to industrial, from slave to wage-labor. The second period, the late nineteenth, early twentieth century, is a period of rapid urbanization accompanied by reform, regulation, and a general effort to understand the racial and ethnic "character" of colonial populations in order to house or locate them properly. The first transitional period can be characterized as a general disag- gregation of components of the built environment, specifically in terms of the function of spaces and structures. Cape archaeologist Antonia Malan, relying predominantly on probate records, describes the layout of whole urban blocks during the period of Dutch occupation: "There is no evidence for slaves and servants being provided with separate accommodation. There does not appear to be evidence for neighborhood specialisation nor signifi- cant stratification" (1998:105). According to C. S. Woodward, cottages "rub shoulders with timber constructions of varying degrees of sophistication, and these in turn are found next to brick and stone buildings varying in p; 1-I 0 0 a m -v n 0 0 z 5 :- m a: m</page><page sequence="9">size" (1982:12). Existing floor plans and probate records illustrate that tremendous flexibility was built into urban and rural households during this period: all households and their interiors were multipurpose, meant to change from day to day according to the changing needs of the family and occupants. Floor plans from this period suggest that movement throughout the house was flexible: contact between family members was not highly regulated. Since rooms were categorized according to their location in the house, their function or purpose was also flexible. A voorhuis, for example, might be located along the side of a house, performing the function of a pas- sageway, or it could be positioned between two side rooms, offering a place to sleep, do business, entertain guests, or hold public meetings. Through Malan's use of probate records for the period 1750-1850, we can glimpse the basic layout of the Cape Dutch townhouse, a layout that unfolds from two centrally located rooms, the voorhuis and galdery, both of which give this structure its communal character and position the household as central to a kinship-based economy and society. The front rooms of the house were fluid, with spaces that could be used for alternating public and private func- tions. The galdery "provided the main venue for family and guest interac- tion, particularly eating together, and many domestic activities with family, servants and slaves together" (Malan 1993:66). Malan's research suggests that women, both slave and free, would have had considerable freedom and control in these households. "Evidence of extensive domestic retailing, inheritance patterns, and careful reading of contemporary comments, taken together challenge assumptions about the secondary nature of women's business in the colonial Cape" (1998:115). A unique aspect of the Cape Dutch vernacular, according to Robert Shell, is the inclusion of female slaves in rural and urban households: Female slaves at the Cape were forced by reason of space to be under the broad thumb of their owner and family and to share their domestic culture. The process was reciprocal, however. Cape slave women helped create a creole culture, cuisine, and language-kitchen Dutch-through the centuries-long archi- tectural arrangements around the Cape kitchen. (2001:261) The large entrance hall, characteristic of all Dutch colonial homes, was a uniquely flexible room. It could be used as a parlor, a dining room, and, on occasions, a bedroom. The voorhuis, or entrance hall, was usually flanked on each side by bedrooms, so that, if all doors in this house were open, the interior life of the whole household could be rendered accessible from the galdery, and, for that matter, the outside. According to Cape architectural historian, Carlo De Bosdari, the boundaries of the center of the house could themselves be rendered permeable or negotiable: "The entrance-hall or Voorhuis, is often divided from the main reception-room by a SCREEN.... For dances, the leaves are folded one on another, and the two P-I 0 pa 0 I z z 0 z 9 0 z</page><page sequence="10">sides of the door then open and lie almost flush with the side-walls, thereby making the whole centre of the house into one large room" (1953:23). Nathaniel Merriman describes, in his journals (from 1848 to 1855), the openness of the Cape Dutch household: "They all live (family, and to a great extent, servants too) in the great 'fore-house' [voorhuis].... The Coloured woman has always her baby, and sometimes two ... even ... three children ... playing in the room. If the baby cries, the vrow [sic] will perhaps send one of her own children to nurse it" (quoted in Lewsen 1982:7). Rooms in the earlier Dutch structures did not terminate, they led contiguously into each other. A room was therefore not meant to be a place to stop, particularly not alone. The house itself was not understood as a separate object in the same way it is today. Instead, it was an instrument facilitating an economy that radiated outward rather than inward. Eigh- teenth-century structures often offered a variety of floorplans, depending on the size of lots, but evidence suggests that this began to change by mid- century, particularly in the form of increased and standardized use of the voorhuis. This is interpreted as a shift toward formalization of function and vernacular (Brink 1990). So, with the mid-nineteenth-century expansion of the merchant class, and then subsequent laboring classes, households were being "refashioned towards specialised spaces" and were beginning to "contrast more and more with those urban and rural households that [had] retained a communal character" in the previous era (Malan 1993:94). According to architectural historian Robin Evans, it was the Brit- ish who, in the late sixteenth century, created the domestic passageway and then proliferated in subsequent centuries the use of the terminal room, separating routes and destinations inside the household: "This split between an architecture to look through and an architecture to hide in cut an unbridgeable gap dividing commodity from delight, utility from beauty, and function from form" (1997:74). Following the more standardized use of the voorhuis, then, came another comprehensive change: the installation of passageways and walls, and the relocation of doors, to facilitate termination of movement (for a surviving example, see changes in the floorplan of the Koopmans de Wet House, downtown Cape Town). Passageways started out big and broad, conducive to brief contact, as one can see with the few Geor- gian homes still standing in Cape Town (see Bertram House, for example). These were eventually narrowed into the steeply graded staircases and dark and constraining tunnels of the Victorian period, when contact within the house was kept at an absolute minimum. According to Robert Ross: The increased stress on privacy which the English strove for meant that they built houses with halls and corridors, from which the rooms opened, rather than having a voorkamer opening directly to the street from which all other houses emanated. Benjamin Moodie, taking over a Dutch house at Grootvadersbosch near Swellendam, felt himself required to erect an interior partition to separate his living quarters - 0 r) 0 -o 0 0 z :&gt; rn I m c m</page><page sequence="11">from those of the servants and from the smells of the kitchen. (1999:81) The diary of J. W. D. Moodie, a British traveler in 1835, reveals the sense of spatial discomfort many British would experience with Dutch architectural traditions: In a Cape farmer's house there is no privacy. The family sit at one end of their long halls, while the other is a kind of thoroughfare for the slaves and house-servants pursuing their culinary options, who over [sic] hear the conversa- tion and know all the most private affairs of their master and mistress nearly as well they do themselves. (quoted in Dooling 1994:37) Such discomfort corresponded to changes in the meaning and signifi- cance of domestic architecture at midcentury. This is the point where the social skin that contains and defines colonial society becomes unusually vulnerable (McClintock 1995). Vulnerability occurred at the intersection of a variety of boundaries. According to Pamela Scully, "British slave emanci- pation reconfigured the relations between men and women, and individual and society" (1997:2). Notions of "rural" and "urban" blur with industrial- ization and the rapid influx of unskilled African labor from the surrounding countryside. Boundaries separating classes and status groups shift with the bourgoisification of a skilled, educated, urban, black labor force. Race and gender distinctions begin to blur with the regular phenomenon of racial passing and the ubiquity of miscegenation. Even the separation between individual bodies and society is contaminated with demographic density and the epidemic proliferation of air- and water-borne diseases. Between the mid nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Cape Town, as a result, became associated with congestion and contamination (Bickford-Smith 1984). For colonial officials, particularly the British, this development inspired a gradual implementation of rules and regulations to coordinate all movement and activity in the city; individuals, in a sense, had to be aided in their own self-governance. Anticipating the Modern Small-pox owes its spread to the reckless wandering of coloured folks from infected parts. (Cape Times, 1882) A broad political and economic transition occurred when the British dis- mantled the Roman-Dutch system of law in the Cape: this emancipated and ameliorated slaves, contributed to the formation of rights-bearing individu- als, and aided in industrializing labor and the production processes (Ross 0 p -q I z 0 0 z z z</page><page sequence="12">1980). The home became decentered as a site and medium of production; exchange no longer took place in the domestic sphere. Exchange and pro- duction were separated, with each occurring in a domain of intensifying and dangerous contact between strangers. Marks and Bezzoli describe how public and private became newly distinguished features for houses in nine- teenth-century district six (a working-class residential area once located in the center of town). The earliest houses were "built directly onto the street," but subsequent houses had "stoeps (verandahs) to mediate the transition between the public street and the private interior" (2000:278). Second-story verandas were eventually covered with "broekie lace," ornately patterned wrought iron. Between 1893 and 1901, municipal regulations established by the Corporation of the City of Cape Town reflect increased standardiza- tion of the materials and dimensions of walls, windows, passageways, and street curbs separating public and private spheres (Cape Town, n.d.). These features indicate a gradual attempt to set the interior of homes, and mixed residential and retail buildings, apart from the life unfolding on the streets around them. With the earlier arrival, in 1820, of large groups of poor and unskilled English settlers looking for opportunity, a building boom occurred, invok- ing an expanding need for the construction of inexpensive, respectable homes to provide a buffer between the familiarity of England and the anxi- ety of the frontier. By the end of the nineteenth century, residential areas of Cape Town began to reflect increased separation of social statuses, class positions, and stylistic preferences; despite varieties in scale and surface decoration, however, the interiors of homes at this time are described as somewhat standardized. The ideal interior of the household had numerous, autonomous rooms, each with its own function, and its own fireplace. Pan- eled doors were introduced to facilitate autonomy and boundary distinc- tion, and hallways were added to channel movement in accord with the separation of function and prescribed activity. Marks and Bezzoli describe the floorplan for the working classes of district six: "While the actual width and length of the dwelling varied, the spatial layout remained fairly consistent. This comprised two main spaces-the front 'sitting room' and the back 'bedroom'-connected to each other by means of a passageway and terminating at the kitchen" (2000:278). The second transitional period of architectural change can therefore be characterized in terms of an increased separation of surface and interior as distinct sources of truth. Clues to the pathology that lay hidden could be discerned from aspects of the surface of built structures. In the city, signs of disease took the form of clogged drains and overcrowded tenements; these problems also forecast social disorder, because, in an analysis that conflated physi- cal with moral 'debility,' environmental factors were thought capable of eroding self-discipline and moral rectitude: insa- lubrious living conditions, in short, could breed prostitution, trade unionism, and revolutionary politics. (Poovey 1995:41) I-. -l 0 p i n 0 0 m z 5; r- m I H c m</page><page sequence="13">By 1901, bubonic plague and epidemic disease in Cape Town were offering imaginative metaphors for all forms of boundary confusion and disorder (Foucault 1995; Swanson 1977). Cape Town's urban experts looked at the unregulated contact between bodies and populations, the instability of particular racialized bodies, and eventually the homes and spaces that produced such bodies as the generative sites of disorder. From early descriptions of inner-city Cape Town, a projection of anthropomorphic qualities onto the built environment emerges. In a Cape Times article from 1901, an anonymous author offers a description of dis- tricts one and two, areas dominated by Coloured ("mixed-race") and work- ing-class residents: "The houses are thrown together in flat solid blocks into which little air can penetrate. They are, in their very design, at war with the principles of sanitation. The houses are villainous looking" (1901b:5). Observable surfaces, such as that of the body and the built environment, then, are coordinated with interior and spatial truth. An evocative quote from Poovey details the anatomical realism that supported detailed inspec- tion and statistical surveying of structures and neighborhoods in Manches- ter, England: "The influence of anatomy upon this kind of social survey is even clearer in . .. examples of . .. the engravings that depict working-class houses with their external walls peeled back to reveal sparsely furnished interiors, babies crawling on damp-stained floors, and overcrowded beds" (1995:83). Similar passages can be found in turn-of-the-century Cape Town. In the Cape Times article mentioned above, pathology is not just discerned from surfaces: it is also associated with time, with tradition, or the tendency to cling to old bad habits. For certain populations in Cape Town, particu- larly the "mixed-race" Cape Malay (Bickford-Smith 2001), urban pathology comes from an unwillingness to modernize one's habits. The dirt of Districts No. 1 and No. 2 is old dirt. It treads the air of venerableness. It seems to have accumulated and grown with the old Malay you see sitting, grey and shaky, wrinkled, and half blind, on his stoep. It is part and parcel of the crazy flat-roofed [Dutch Colonial] house in which that old Malay and his progeny live. (Cape Town, n.d.) Officials therefore believed that improved or reformed habits of individual bodies, supported by the "softer" interventions of white women, in the form of nurses, for example, and more efficient and rule-governed struc- tures, would provide automatic correctives to unscrupulous speculation, overcrowding, and the irrational tendencies of the human body. From the onset of rapid urbanization (late nineteenth century) to the start of Union government in South Africa (1910), city officials and profes- sionals were searching for a primary set of objects and bodies on which to focus their reform efforts. These had to be knowable, observable sites, which would ensure efficient expenditure and successful intervention into the broader lives of private subjects and citizens. The household, believed to be o- n z z 0 z 0 z</page><page sequence="14">both analogous to and a natural extension of the human body, had bound- aries that could be consciously contained, and, positioned at the threshold between the public sphere and the private household in Cape Town, are two types of bodies-those of European women and those of Coloured women, the latter generally being domestics, who worked in public washhouses and factories. According to Cape historian Elizabeth van Heyningen, Coloured women became explicit targets of legislative and architectural control because of the association of their bodies with contagion (particularly syphilis) and their intimate access to the porous, but respectable, private sphere. It was claimed that "respectable families have become infected through their nurses and washerwomen" (1984:90). Cape Coloureds were also accused of inflicting a type of biological warfare on Victorian Cape Town (Bickford-Smith 1984). A resident wrote to the Cape Times: "Kindly inform me and the public at large as to the best method of disinfecting washing, etc. There is a grave danger attached to the sending out of wash clothes, for in the majority of cases they are taken to the dwelling-houses of the Malays" (Cape Times, 1901a). Coloureds, or mixed-race women, are, in the words of Lauren Berlant, "paradigm problem citizens": she writes that "a woman who lives with dif- ference, either gendered or racial, enjoys no prophylactic private sphere, no space safe from performance or imitation" (1993:197). For Cape Town, such a woman enjoys no space safe from scrutiny or regulation. The prevailing question for colonial, postcolonial, and apartheid administrators has been "Where do such groups naturally belong?" Africans in cities, by the same token, challenged an order that autochthonously linked them to pristine and natural landscapes. Susan Parnell demonstrates that Africans were not even included in South Africa's early town-planning acts: "The introduction of public health and town-planning legislation was not intended to supple- ment segregationist legislation, indeed it was not intended that colonial city planning standards apply to Africans at all (1993:3). The transition to modernism in Cape Town therefore corresponds to the need to contain and separate, taxonomically and spatially, populations considered natural and necessary to the city's expansion as an industrial port. Respectable women and "native" Africans were considered out of place in the urban public sphere; Africans could be relocated to the "tradi- tional" space of reserves or native locations (Robinson 1996), and respectable women could be naturally linked to the private sphere and the education of private habits. Softer forms of coercion and control, such as that offered by architecture and domestic reform, however, proved insufficient in the cleaning up of Cape Town. The next line of defense became urban planning.

It must be artificial, not natural" (G. M. Trevelyan, 1907:416). G. R. Searle describes the period after the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902) as one of defensive nation-building in England. Lessons gleaned from the war inspired the British to focus on the declining health of the mind and body of the Empire; this shift led them to enthusiastically embrace the promises of industrial technology and focus reform in the direction of what Searle describes as "national efficiency" (1971). The Heart of the Empire (1907), a collection of essays, was published by some of the more vocal urban reform- ers in England. A theme expressed throughout the collection is that the city was creating its own type of inhabitant: a new race of physically vulnerable, emotionally excitable, spiritually empty city dweller, a "city-type," which would eventually degrade the entirety of the British Empire. "The problem of the coming years is just the problem of this New Town Type; upon their development and action depend the future progress of the Anglo-Saxon Race, and for the next half-century at least the policy of the British Empire in the world" (Masterman 1907:7). The solution was to be found, not in the reform of economy or soci- ety, but in living conditions, and this was to be accomplished through science-a frame of mind that would provide a neutral, technical bridge between nature and culture, the transcendent and the contrived. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli (1868, 1874-1880), in his novel Lothair (1870), declares that poverty is "not an affair so much of wages as of dwellings" (quoted in Read 1994:51). The problem was therefore not with industrializa- tion or capitalism per se, but with a growing population that was becoming physically isolated from nature and its moralizing benefits. It is by means of a calculated balance among technology, industry, and state intervention in social affairs that order is to be restored to the city: "The way back to Nature herself lies now through dexterous use of Artifice and modern inventions towards that end" (Trevelyan,1907:405). The Cape Town Municipality was established in 1839, but it was not given any legal muscle until regulations modeled after the English Public Health, Housing, and Town Planning Acts were passed and then strength- ened, in the mid-to-late nineteenth century. In an address to the Town Planning Association of Transvaal in 1922, Charles Porter, a member of the Public Health Council of the Union, pointed out that it was not until the Public Health Act of 1919 had been passed that conscious, unified effort was made to standardize building regulations properly. He stressed that before this point, rampant unchecked property speculation had created the only unifying direction to the evolution of the built environment. The Municipal journal, "The Official Organ of the Cape Municipal Association," which began circulating in 1918, provides documentation of ra C) -I 0 z z 0 z n 0 z</page><page sequence="16">the priorities being set by local government officials and building profes- sionals regarding the management of the city. This is the problem before us to-day, to interest the adult population, who, in many cases, are ready to believe that all health matters should be left to the constituted authority to deal with. The clarion call should be that the maintenance of health is very largely a personal matter, and that not only is an individual keeper of his own health, but that of his brother as well. The crusade of health propagandists should always be-'Self-Help in Health.' (1926:21) There is evidence of a constant struggle to establish agreement between colonial, national, and local municipal government agents. Between 1918 and 1927, articles in the Municipal Journal shift in emphasis from atten- tion to the city as a whole, with general concern about how to establish and then enforce the standardization of building codes, to more focused attention on individual behavior and the private domestic sphere. We can interpret this as an increased desire to draw the state into manipulating city dwellers' living conditions. Urban-reform rhetoric begins to shift from the collective need to establish public and state management to the more particularized concentration on the relationship between the home and the city as rhetorically separate sites of control. When individuals focused attention on their own homes, they were, in essence, improving the city by extension. The ultimate goal was to change behavior, and thus the city, from the inside out. Evidence of a shift from loosely standardized Victorian floorplans to a more standardized and deliberate intervention into the layout of domestic space can be found in the design of workman's cottages. In the same way that Dutch colonial floorplans became anachronistic to the stylistic pro- clivities of the British, Victorian structures became poorly suited for the changing needs of a well-planned city. Victorian homes became traps for the bodies that most needed the benefits of sunshine and the circulation of air. A passage from Cape Town's Architect and Builder reflects the desire for a house that more efficiently protects its inhabitants: The grimness of the semi-detached house with large and lofty living rooms, its long passage, or, in the case of the double-storey house, its long flight of stairs and dismal rooms ill-planned and of shoddy construction, no longer satisfies. This class of house has become in many cases the refuge of families of narrow means, who endure its discomfort for the sake of its respectability, but never for one moment imagine themselves satisfactorily housed. It is a curious reflection that for the great majority of the people one of the first essen- tials of civilized life, the fixed dwelling place, bears little relation to their needs or their desires and requirements. pa -I 0 4&gt; m 0 z I - m c m</page><page sequence="17">A real revival of civil domestic architecture awaits the day of a more genuine patriotism, which would prefer to see public magnificence take the place of private magnificence and a real dignified architecture can hardly be hoped for, while commercial life is full of meanness and tawdriness as it exists in our country this day. (1918:254) According to a 1907 report from the Cape Town Council, printed in The Cape Times, architectural and planning priorities also began to focus different levels of attention on different types of urban residents: It is beginning to be realised that [working-class housing] is a field not unworthy of the best architectural talent-which should not be left the happy hunting ground of [the] slum- landlord and the 'jerry' builder, but should be captured by those who have the best interests of the people at heart, and who realise that simple, convenient houses and artistic and clean surroundings, are absolutely necessary for the improve- ment of the habits, character, and health of the small wage earners. (1907:5) The design of workman's cottages was the earliest experiment in disentan- gling working-class families from each other; the first of these cottages were to be offered to Cape Town's predominantly Coloured municipal employees. Separate designs and locations were created for the municipality's European and Coloured employees, but all structures incorporated a similar logic. In 1919, The Municipal journal described the workman's cottage thus: The cottages have been planned after long experience of the conditions and habits of the class of people to be housed, and thoughtful investigation as to the best manner of solv- ing the many difficulties presented. Hygienic principles have been carefully studied, and questions such as the choice of windows and doors well weighed, with the result that case- ment windows are considered the most suitable, while the type of door is that usually adopted in hospitals, so as to minimise the collection of dust, etc. Passages and awkward corners have been entirely avoided. (1919:55) These structures were to be heavily regulated with regard to the number of people allowed to live in each, and with careful calculation as to the amount of space necessary for each individual to benefit and contribute to proper circulation and ventilation. The goal appears to have been to provide secu- rity and some semblance of comfort while controlling for the conditions of disease and improvidence. These structures presented practical problems where the city failed to induce its targeted Coloureds to occupy the cottages and pay the p -I 0 z z 0 z 0 z</page><page sequence="18">necessary rents. Interviews conducted by city engineers in October of 1919 revealed that most potential residents considered the cottages too heavily regulated with regard to the number of people allowed in each house and room (Housing and Estates Committee, CT/I 1/4/9/1/1/1). This regulation was instituted to prevent jerry-building. The problem with jerry-building is that it does not render the invisible visible: it is done without conformity to standards and regulations, usually behind or on the back of cottages. The resulting additions are extensions of existing structures or autono- mous structures built without official addresses, without the observation of building codes, and without using standardized materials: it is essen- tially something done outside official scrutiny. Though residents still rely on jerry-building to expand their access to space and rental income, the argument persists that such building threatens people's health and safety. City dwellers' habits and character were under constant siege by dis- ease, unscrupulous speculation, and the influx of natives from the interior. Reports from the Medical Officer of Health for the period between 1897 and 1909 illustrate a gradual shift in attention and perspective from the sani- tary conditions of the city in general, to floorplans and building materials used in working-class housing, and then to the behavior or character of the working classes themselves. Interiors, in essence, had to be fully laid bare. By 1902, nurses were being deployed as district inspectors. Her duties are to visit, where so ordered, houses where births have occurred, and to give oral directions as to the feeding and care of the baby; to make inquiries into the deaths of young children; to visit the workrooms of milliners, dressmakers, and places where females are employed, and report as to their sanitary condition, and to inspect houses in certain districts of the City, with a view to encourage habits of cleanliness amongst the lower classes of society. (Cape Town, 1902) The introduction of a more rule-governed architecture therefore expanded reliance on the built environment as a separate and autonomous instrument of social control. To design well, in the Age of Reason, was to know the rules (Lewcock 1963:3). The subjectivity of state interven- tion could then be obscured by refracting the locus of control onto a set of rules and scientific principles considered necessary to the balance of urban artifice and the prescriptions of natural or transcendent order. Timothy Mitchell refers to this refraction as "enframing"-a technique whereby the appearance of order is fostered by an invisible and therefore natural force, one that, if properly channeled, will automatically equilibrate belief, behavior, and environment. The standardization and rational planning of urban space essentially creates a frame, which comes to feel more real than the contingent body that makes the frame possible in the first place. Spatial magnitudes, angles, and gaps "create a framework which appears prior to, and therefore separate from, the objects actually distributed" (Mitchell -g 0 U, 4 0 Ln -o 0 n 0 m z :&gt; I - m m</page><page sequence="19">1991:79). This framework extends to the racialized and gendered contain- ment of particular bodies that abide by a set of interior rules and spatial locations thought to be established prior to society. Conclusion The [modernist] illusion remains ... that practice can be reduced to a system of rational prescriptive rules. (Alberto Perez-G6mez 1983:8) In the words of Apartheid Minister of Native Affairs, Dr. H. F. Verwoerd, the problem of the apartheid city was a matter of "creating .. . order out of the present chaos" (quoted in Posel 1997:68). The apartheid regime, in some respects, extended the classical idea that space is a homogenous container and that objects occupying and filling the container are ordered according to a transcendent pattern. Particular bodies, specifically those of Africans, did not belong in cities. Women could remain in cities, so long as they were tightly linked to the private, domestic sphere. The apartheid regime was fur- ther aided by the confidence that came from the technical and bureaucratic innovations of modernism (Scott 1998). Apartheid can therefore be defined, in part, as a spatial model that was successful in modernist terms, but it required a level of coercion that brought the contradictions of modernism dangerously close to the surface. Robinson (1992) and others point out that despite the dismantling of the coercive component of governance, order remains the ultimate goal of South African planners, who still consider female-centered homes and low-density urban satellites some of the primary instruments of urban order. Anthropologist Steven Robins discovered that "racialized grids and barriers . . . continue to channel and contain white, coloured, and black social interaction" in Cape Town (2000:422). In other words, it is the coer- cive component that was challenged with the dismantling of apartheid, but many traces of modernist spatial logic remain firmly habituated in the daily routines of South Africans. Spatial boundaries have come to feel natural and normal, even in a place like South Africa, where it seems that every boundary is a site of conscious contestation. REFERENCES Alpers, Svetlana. 1983.
