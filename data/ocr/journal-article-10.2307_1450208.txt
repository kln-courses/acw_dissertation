MOSES AL-QUMISI, or al-Damagani, flourished at the end of the ninth or at the beginning of the tenth century. He seems to have been at first an admirer of Anan, whom he afterwards held in low esteem. He composed a nYO, n'D in the Hebrew language, and, as is evident from Qirqisani, also some other writings of which we do not know even the names'. Pinsker (Lickute Kadmonioth, Notes, 1 We obtain some data about this Karaite in the first section of Qirqisani's Kitab al-'Anwdr (see Prof. Bacher in this Review, VII, 687-7I0), edited by Harkavy. We deduce his age from the fact that Qirqisani, in the work here mentioned (written 937), considers him as the last sectarian. Qirqisani mentions also other writings of Daniel, thus (ed. Harkavy), p. 316: n:ia pn 1in ', ,l firn 1'5i ; on the other hand, p. 285, :Nr in 11 ; on p. 280, again, the singular as well as the plural occurs. From the name al- Damagani it may be conjectured that Daniel was a native of the country Qumis in Tabaristan, and that he must therefore have been called al-Qumisi (Harkavy, 1.c., p. 27I, note 8). A David al-Qumisi, otherwise unknown, is mentioned by Mas'fdi in his Kitdb al-tanbih, ed. De Goeje, p. 113. He is said to have lived at Jerusalem, and to have died 945-946. That he was a Karaite, as Harkavy conjectures (ricNsrn mb, II, 281), is to be proved from the following passage from a Karaite commentary in Arabic to Lev. iii. 9 (MS. Bodleian, Hebr. d. 44, f. 6ob): rwiSn n5n bop 1in noD ;1-5HN5 )n 5N7D n75w; lin ;i51p bLcn5iph p4n,5D inv jk nnr mn ncbNi 5r P: wrm rhn n5Rn5n5ls -TO1k N-&lt;nj) 'D 'y nbS 5i: i I-n 1Si 5. i5-15mn snn D5k 5iN1 Nm: p3n N51 ilN fin5n5 n2l rwNh5t n 1n?5t5. li n pM zi i-s? in -n iSr ',t:n in'ly npirn P-, 11Inn 1:.

Subsequently I found this Karaite cited also in Jefeth's Comm. on Lev. xxiii. 5 (second recension? Brit. Mus. MS. Or. 2518, f. 72 a). Various opinions are here given for the circumstance, that the I5th of Nissan falls on a Sabbath.

Sagir. Dr. Harkavy published (Magazinfiir d. Wissensch. d. Judent. XX, 227-228) three more passages from Petersburg manuscripts. Since Daniel's book is one of the oldest Karaite codes extant, and more- over, as it is written in the Hebrew language, it rouses special interest. It may therefore not be unwelcome if I now publish a further extract from the same book. The British Museum MS. Or. 2494, from which I take this extract, contains, if. 3I-8o, a frag- ment of a Karaite commentary, in Arabic, on Lev. xi. 37-43. This commentary, composed I050 E. C., is a compilation chiefly from Qirqisani, 'Abu 'Ali (i. e. Jefeth b. 'Ali), 'Abu Said (i. e. Levi b. Jefeth, v. Pinsker, 1. c., p. tt"p), 'Abu-l Sari (i. e. Sahl b. Mazliach), Al-Rais, and other authors. In addition to these, other Karaite authors are cited, such as 'Anan, Daniel and 'Abu Jaqub, i. e. Josef al-Basir. The passage that follows is indeed not described as taken from the niYli,l "DO, nevertheless I believe this to be the fact on the evidence of its contents. As a convincing argument I may point out that, in the quotation in question Daniel deals with Lev. vii. 24, where it is said, that the fat of a beast that died by itself and that of an animal torn with beasts may be used for any other purpose except to be eaten. The Talmudists conclude from this, that the fat does not cause any uncleanness (v. Sifra to this passage). The Karaites, however, do not admit this conclusion, and accordingly they find the passage not free from difficulties. Daniel explains it by saying that if the body of the beast which died by itself, or was torn, is used in a manufacture, it is no more unclean. This opinion is cited by Jehuda Hadassi, Eshkol Hakkofer, alphabet 287, letter J (f. Io8 c): min 'lini n n i:D nWp i n-iD rnm rm5) 'ni KW vnY' 45m m,rnW p ?

Saadja and Salmon b. Jerucham. Sahl b. Mazliach in his nh$15 nnl1n, as his controversial tract against Jacob b. Samuel, the disciple of Saadja, is styled, gives a list of those Karaite authors who opposed Saadja's views. Of these, Ben- Mashiach and Salmon b. Jerucham must have written against the Gaon even during his lifetime; others again, such as 'Abul-Tajjib al-Jebeli, 'Ali b. Hasan, 'Abu 'Ali Hasan al-Basri (i. e. Jefeth b. 'Ali), Sahl himself, and several more, did not attack him till after his death . It is not known whether all the Karaites here mentioned wrote whole treatises against Saadja, or whether, as is more probable, they only occasionally controverted his opinions. We only know with certainty that Salmon and Jefeth belong to the first class. The latter mentions his polemic against Saadja in his commentary to Exod. xxxv. 3 5; this treatise, however, has not yet been discovered, and we do not know whether Jefeth wrote it in Arabic, like most of his works, or in Hebrew, the language he selected for his controversy with Jacob b. Samuel. Salmon's book, however, is extant in MS. in some libraries6. Lev. xi. 39, MS. cn5S:2. 2 Kings vi. 29. The sense is, if it can even happen that men should eat human flesh, how much more possible is it that they should consume that of an animal that had died of itself. 3 Lev.v. 2.

My quotation follows the Leyden MS.</page><page sequence="5">KARAITE MISCELLANIES 685 This treatise, entitled by the later Karaites ' nt11rT 1, is written in Hebrew. The author also intended to translate it into Arabic2, but it is not known whether he carried out his intention or not. Sahl distinctly says that Salmon entered the lists against Saadja with a Hebrew treatise. The book, which is written in a wretched rhymed-prose, has a scarcely intelligible introduction, which is only partly preserved, and has no connexion with the real contents of the work. The work contains, further, nineteen chapters, which are alternately written with the acrostic '' : ' and p"'' ; with the exception of chapters II and i9, in which the acrostic is p p';D Dnrn. The fragment of the introduction, which has been preserved, and the first two chapters are published in the Litteraturblatt d. Orients, VII, 23, 163, 2II. Pinsker, pp. I6-I9, gives a summary of the contents of the whole book, but he accounts only for thirteen chapters; in his copy chaps. 3, 4, I6-I9 were lacking3. I will therefore supplement his account by giving the contents of these six chapters. Chapter 3 is connected with the first two, and endeavours to refute the arguments for the inspiration and necessity of the oral law. Saadja's seven arguments for the necessity of tradition, as given in his Commentary to Genesis, are here specially cited and refuted 4. Salmon's arguments against the alterations in the date of the Passover fnD 3 l :T KS are given in chap. 4. He quotes in evidence Ezra vii. 9 and viii. 31-33, and maintains that at that time the Passover festival must necessarily have begun on one of the days which Rabbinical tradition excludes. This argument is also to be found in Qirqisani, with whom probably it had its origin5. Hadassi This name is first mentioned by the author of the cD'p'12 rm (ed. Vienna, f. 24a), see Geiger, in irnn nsi;, IV, 13, comp. also Litteratbl. d. Orients, VII, 17. 2 See Pinsker, p. I5e See ib., p. I33, note i. 4 Saadja's arguments, without the refutations of Salmon, are given by Geiger, Wisscnschaft. Zeitschr.fiurjiudische Theologie, V, I33. These seven argu- ments are also quoted and refuted in a fragment of a Karaite work in the British Museum, MS. Or. 2580, f. 46, entitled nw= cns5%s 2ss. This fragment belongs (see Steinschneider-Festschrift, p. 209) to the second section (~,nzi~5 fin'pC) of Qirqisani's Kitdb al-'Anwdr. Among other things there we find it stated: Dri n , 5r . jn 25.

Z Z</page><page sequence="6">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW also, in his Eshkol Hakkofer, alphabet I85 (comp. also Gani Eden, T':~ t'Inn wtl p, ? 5), quotes this argument, and I cannot say which of these two earlier Karaites was his authority. In chapters i6-I8 nearly the whole of the nt1)p ')nWV is para- phrased . In the Igth and last chapter, Salmon expresses the hope that the temple will be erected again, and the truth established. He writes against Saadja also in this chapter. The tone of this book is outrageously personal. He insults the Rabbanites in general, and Saadja in particular, in the rudest manner; in this respect he is scarcely surpassed by Jehuda Hadassi. It seems as if he himself felt that he had considerably overstepped the bounds of courtesy, for he urges the excuse that he was piqued and irritated by Saadja's attack on the Karaites2. His phraseology is awkward in the extreme, and makes everybody sensible of the deficiency of the book as regards a lofty ideal. At all events the work is worthy of notice as it is unique in its kind, and of so early a period. We will now try to fix the time when this book was composed. We have in Sahl's statement a terminus ad quern, that Salmon wrote against Saadja during the Gaon's life. And indeed the whole tone of Neubauer, Mediaecal Jewish Chronicles, II, 249). whilst Salmon wrote his polemic, if my conjecture be correct, not before 940. I have found the passage in a compendium (rzhni) of Qirqisani (British Museum MS. Or. 2525, see Steinschneider-Festschrift, p. 21I). The chapter referred to is headed: TwinU'ws ('iNn4:t :rnnx ') n,p NwLn E ; and is also taken from the seventh section of the Kitib al-'Anwdr.

Note for instance the challenge thrown out to Saadja to be consistent with himself, and either to concur with the opinions of the Rabbanites, or to adopt the view of the Karaites'; to openly oppose him (Salmon) and to reply to his objections 2; mark also the observation, that whatever Saadja might have to say would only be weak and inconclusive . Where, however, can we place the terminus a quo ? I think I shall be able to fix it from a passage taken from this polemical treatise itself. In the second chapter, Salmon cites one of Saadja's arguments for the necessity of committing the oral law to writing. The passage runs as follows (Litteratbl. d. Orients, 1. c., 215): ? Irlnn: ,58n npn CK * 'u n^1sY 1 nD tcln w " ,wnn NS ; nSi^ppn nrt ;yvri 4 rw nnin twn-io llW n3 ppn pipn" In other words, Saadja maintains, in one of his works, that the Mishnah was written down because it was feared it might otherwise be forgotten. Now Saadja gives this reason for writing the Mishnah in his tl1. aDD) or rather in the Arabic commentary to it, as is distinctly mentioned in a fragment of a Karaite polemic against its author 4. This will explain the term ,l% P which Salmon uses. Saadja's opponents named this work thus, because of its being divided into verses and accented like a book of the Bible, and they reproached him by sneeringly asking whether he would pass for a prophet'. Consequently no other treatise of Saadja's could be meant, although this argument anent the compilation of the Mishnah may perhaps be mentioned elsewhere 6.

I would be inclined to fix the later years of this interval as the date of Salmon's attack, because most of Salmon's Bible Commentaries were written in the sixth decade of the tenth century. The Commentary to the Psalms he composed, according to his own statement, in 955 , the Commentary to Lamentations in 9563, the Commentary to the Song of Solomon is mentioned as contemplated in the former work, in the latter, however, it is already quoted, consequently this also was composed between 955-9564. But the remaining Commentaries, with the exception of that to Daniel, were probably written after this time 5. We may therefore suppose, with a certain amount of probability, that Salmon composed his work about 940. If my conjectures in this respect be correct, we can also obtain an inkling as to the year of Salmon's birth.

See Harkavy, ibid., 142. If this date only refers to the first recension of the -1rn nmC, and not to the other which Saadja provided with an Arabic commentary, and in which the origin as well as the committal to writing of the oral tradition was laid down, then it becomes all the more certain that Salmon composed his polemic much later than 934. 2 In Commentary to Psalm cii. he gives the year 887 after the destruc- tion of the second temple as the date. This is not 4717 of the era anno mundi, as Pinsker (p. I30) wrongly states, but 4715 (=955 C.E.), for ac- cording to Jewish reckoning the destruction occurred in the year 68 C.E., not 70. 3 In Pinsker, p. 132, we read r,ii, ; likewise in the Paris MS. 295, where we find: ;fiD :-srni Dzj 'ND a oni, viz. 953. But this is impos- sible, because the Commentary to Psalms is already cited here. The British Museum MS. Or. 2516, f. 13 a, has the right date, viz. niiN- =956, MS. Or. 2513, f. 129 a, has even niS,:i. Of this Commentary I have found eight pages in the British Museum MS. Or. 2520, if. 68-75, for the most part illegible. To Song of Songs ii. II there is a long excursus, in which Saadja's calculation of the year of redemption derived fromi Daniel is quoted and attacked. He then cites the eighth section of Saadja's Emunoth Vedeoth ( rnn[H]4n :n3 I',n ',D nir ribo sr). Salmon writes on the same theme in his Commentary to Psalm eii. I5. See Pinsker, p. 8r. 5 This is inferred from the fact that only the Commentary to Daniel is quoted in that to Echa, see Pinsker, p. 132.</page><page sequence="9">KARAITE MISCELLANIES 689 statement, he was at the time he wrote his polemic a young man'. Supposing he was between twenty and twenty-five years old, it will be evident that he was born about 915 or 920. At all events he was considerably younger than Saadja, and the fable invented by the later Karaites that the Gaon was his disciple, is chronologically impossible, besides being incredible for many other reasons 2. It is further evident from this, that the pretended Muqaddima of Salmon (Pinsker, Notes, p. 6I), according to which he would have been born 196 aer. contr. = 885 c. E., is a clumsy falsification, also the state- ment that he came from Egypt, a statement which was probably only invented (by Firkowitsch ?), to make it possible that Saadja was the disciple of Salmon in that country . Besides this polemic, Salmon attacks Saadja in his Commentary to the Psalms4. He attacks him likewise in his Commentary to the Song of Solomon 5. On the other hand, Salmon does not mention the name of Saadja in his Commentary to Echa and Koheleth. Neither does he attack him anonymously, so far as I can judge from a super- ficial reading of these works. It is quite possible that he quotes now and then Saadja's translation or explanation anonymously and rejects it, but at all events this is done without any animosity 6. But did Saadja write a reply to Salmon's attacks? I scarcely think that he did. Four anti-Karaite works of Saadja are known 7: (I) pP ~P 3nM Z2Snf, A Refiltation of Anan, written 9I5. (2) KSni P414:nr , Book of Distinction, written 926. Both these are out of the question owing to the date of their composition8, apart from the Chapter II, letter : ?,D-np ,o Dcnw Dn,'5 :3N =-4 . 2 See Pinsker, p. 135; Weiss, 1,twnn1 n11 n1, IV, 95, i39; compare also the Epigraph of Elia b. Baruch in Bardach's rwn ',a7 T1n, p. 37. 3 It follows from his Commentary to Psalm cxl. 6 (by Pinsker, p. I4), 3psrs5 ,5r mr nr,nw, that he did not live at Babylon, which is also evident from his polemic, Chapter I, letter A (Litteratbl. d.

This Karaite is not mentioned anywhere else. Geiger therefore conjectures, that it is the Arabic name of our Salmon, but this is a mere hypothesis which is destitute of probability. In the same manner it seems very unlikely that this work is, as Geiger conjectures, identical with (4) The (?) 1'm rnn y 2N' T ln:3, Refutation of the Bold Opponent2, cited by Nissim b. Jacob, and to understand by this " bold opponent" Salmon, i.e. Ibn Saqeije. Saadja's work against Ibn Saqcije deals mainly with the fixing of the Spring, ::l'IS ntqOn, by the intercala- tion of a month3. The work mentioned by Nissim, however, chiefly aims at defending the Anthropomorphic Agada, and is doubtless identical with that work of Saadja, from which Jehuda b. Barzilai, in his Commentary to Sefer Jezira (ed. Halberstam, pp. 20, 34), quotes two passages. From the contents of these we can clearly see the aim of the whole work'. Salmon has of course in his polemical treatise devoted a large space to the Anthropomorphic Agada (see above, p. 3), but it is difficult to comprehend why Saadja in a work -lirected against Salmon, should have singled out only this one point 5 On the other hand if our supposition be correct, that Sallmon com- posed his polemical work not much before 940. it is extremely doubtful whether Saadja could have seen it, or if he saw it, whether he found it necessary to write a reply to a young Karaite author, who wrote in so conceited a tone. We may remark, in passing, that Saadja composed the last-men- the above-mentioned Muqaddima as accurate. Steinscllneider (1. c., 2165) suggests that Salmon specially attacked this work of Saadja's, but this is also improbable, for lie merely cites it as he does other works of Saadja, as his ,in i-c, his Commentary to Genesis, and Esther (see Dukes, 1. c., p.

(see xii. 7 and xiii. I5). To this Jefeth replies, that as the promise was not accompanied by oath or bond, Abraham was afraid that it might perhaps be dependent on certain conditions, and that its fulfilment might be uncertain. He was therefore anxious to assure himselfl. The second question is, if Abraham had even remained childless how could Eliezer have become his heir? What became of his nearest relations, such as brothers and sisters, nephew, &amp;c.2? To this Jefeth gives the following five answers. According to one supposition, as long as a man lives he can dispose of his fortune in accordance with his own pleasure, only after his death the heirs may step in to claim their right. Now as Eliezer was an excellent and obedient slave Abraham could present him with all his fortune during his lifetime. Others again maintain, that before the revelation of the Law a slave born in the house (-1'4 nf3) was the privileged heir next to the children of the possessor, and had consequently the preference before the other relations. The supporters of this view rely upon the verse in question, Genesis xv. 3. On the other hand others suppose that the right of inheritance did not suffer any change through the revelation3. The sisters daughter's share in the inheritance. One rnp,n rnv '%, otherwise unknown, was of the opinion, that a daughter's share of the inheritance is equal to that of a son. The following words of this Karaite, which are given in his name by Aaron b. Elia (Gan Eden, f. I65 d; compare Bashiatchi, Adereth, f. II9 c), are worthy of notice: "I thought at first that I am alone in my opinion, but I found afterwards that David b. Boaz and many others also adopted this view," still he does not mention their names. But Aaron unveils this secret by quoting the passage of the Talmud, Baba Bathra, i I5 b: j;ylw 1N p'rnw ;, b"nwVV: "N. ' T: ',E (by Aaron p1n Dp) Pi n: 2 Dr nl n ni,n ?l : ' p01 ip~1x nw rr3 .R. Accordingly we see here the close connexion between Sadducees and Karaites, and a further evidence for the well-known hypothesis of Geiger, according to which the later sect would be the spiritual successors of the former. The view of Daniel al-Qumisi, according to which one-third part of the heritage belongs to the daughter, is further to be noticed. This law is similar to that of the Qoran, see the quotation from the -nwrn n: to Num. xxvii. by Pinsker, 85: inP 'cp s':1n D'ron, n r.m n r- : nbn: n,w,~v na5, also Gan Eden, f. I69 d. Compare Nachmanides (ad loc.), where this question is raised, and answered somewhat differently. 2 In the Arabic original the passage runs is rsR41 i',1 ns, " Father, sister and brother's son." But the word as must be a slip, for Terah was already dead. 3 The question whether at the revelation several divine ordinances were 692</page><page sequence="13">KARAITE MISCELLANIES 693 and brothers of Abraham, however, cannot be taken into account because of their being disbelievers, and as such they were not allowed to become the heirs of a believer'. Lot, again, voluntarily departed from Abraham and assimilated with the inhabitants of Sodom. Therefore Abraham would rather bequeath his goods to a slave thaln to him. A fourth view is that the word t'1' does not mean here "inherit" but "govern." Abraham complains then that he must, for want of a son, let his fortunes be governed by a slave. Lastly, many explain the text in the following way: Abraham had complained before God, that his fortune must necessarily fall into the hands of Eliezer because Lot had separated from him and he was at that time childless, nor could he appoint his relations of Haran as his heirs (because they were too remote from him?). So Eliezer thought: the fortune of my lord must needs come into my possession. Of all these explanations Jefeth chose the second, and decided accordingly. His words run as follow2:- i:K D ip irpln niDn -7nKn DK~5 rD j ..,rw '"P -rh^ m^Kn pn.r6 n3 Im NzK tnym n- i K 1 1p IiK rN npn ,m1l y Sn , n K1 4-lw p *Wa li4 ntil nI6 nn 15 ipl ;nm 17I tli' tnK '|Irti ^r Slp IN I 1 in nlwsKl 'tK vnr 4n4z pt rw:D Kn: nCnl ,^31^3 n^M nS' bh K12 Cp3 ^non a r\K tK DiM t.1n83 rtia D,nnnR nK nD: D01n^m11 FD F'aR nnw 7bi l[r] nnn3 KS I5n L ,ptNn shnn 6nDK nN ;nK Qrv r1L LI- n;13 t12 rl KN nn In D 4hnDmz ilp In 1i ni5R nuy Nn 6V49 modified was hotly discussed and variously answered by Karaites.

But Genesis xxxviii. 8 proves that the brother-in-law was involved in the Levirate union. Karaites who deny that any change in the divine laws occurred at the Revelation, remove this difficulty by artificial assumptions. 1 This law, also known to Islam, was accepted by Rabbanites as well as Karaites.

This is its meaning according to the Talmnud (Zeba- himn, Ioi a), and almost all commentators agree with it. The verl) 4ni31 would then have the force of an imperfect, and the n in =U3n would be a sign of interrogation. Thus both words are irregular.</page><page sequence="15">KARAITE MISCELLANIES 695 The first has the accent upon the penultimate syllable, and the 1 has a patach with a dagesh following. The last circumstance especially forces itself upon the observation of Jewish grammarians, comp. e.g. Abulwalid, Kitdb al-luma', p. 357, 1. 24: NIlnn ',"n 3 3zz n1 i2 p nnti KNW= NiK3 1n p , rljlnl = tis: KlMYn K4R KNinvi nn65N KN14N Kb3D M,131 Kl 2D " jlA.

In order to avoid these two irregularities, there are some gram- marians who consider nt3Kl as the perfect tense, and the n of Nt4s, as an article. They explain the passage in the following manner: "Behold my sons have offered to-day their burnt-offerings and sin- offerings, and now this misfortune has happened to me. I ate therefore of the sin-offering (only so much) that was acceptable to God, that is I ate only a trifle in order to fulfil my duty, the remainder however was burnt." Ibn Ezra, commenting on this passage, cites this explanation in the name of some grammarians, 'r t1 ' i'lpTlD Wt, but he adds, that in any case it remains an irregularity, as the '1 in the sense of an article cannot be placed before an imperfect tense. From another passage we now gather that the grammarians here referred to were Karaites, see Zahoth, i8 a: ~1)V t"' f n, n ,1 103 nyln ;l ,mz ny 3 N p i sy bsw j m- =in wnn r t= i nt 'n '11 niw:l ml n1Y3 t ill 1 ll "3yz 3U nwNl.

That is, although they would not on this day, the day of his calamity Y, eat the sin-offering in the usual manner, yet they were bound at least to taste something of it. For according to the law, even a morsel is sufficient. Our antagonists interpret this passage as meaning that they did not eat any portion of the sin-offering on the day of their calamity. To which we reply: If Moses knew that the sin-offering ought to be burnt, and not eaten, why was he so angry with Eliezer and Ithamar, when on his asking as to what had become of the sin-offering, he was told that it had been burnt ? They on their part contend that Moses wished to try them, and therefore he blamed them as a teacher declaims against his disciple, till he ascertains from him just what he would like to know. Moreover Moses was anxious to find out whether they had refrained from eating the sin-offering because they knew that it was prohibited, or whether their action was the result of an accident, more especially as Nadab and Abihu had already met with death through their ignorance. He was therefore angry with the other two in order to know why they did not eat it. In reply, we observe further: A wise man would not be angry about such a thing except with a child, or with a man, who has eaten with- out cognizance of the law (?). Aaron and his sons, however, do not belong to this class. If this should be true, it follows that my interpretation of the meaning is the better, and that the word 4n/D^ is a perfect tense." Still the fact remains, that not all Rabbanite grammarians support the view of the Talmud, nor are the Karaites unanimous on the other side. Of the former, a certain grammarian at the beginning of the twelfth century, is astonished at Abu-l-Fahm (Levi) Ibn at-Taban for Probably the reading should be 15 N ,,cN R , or ,N5 m :~ 1 N MS. . e. on he day of . 2 MS. inrc. 3 I. e. on the day of r,nu3.</page><page sequence="17">KARAITE MISCELLANIES 697 maintaining that the n in t^li'i and in lnnTnl is a sign of interroga- tionl.

This Said is otherwise quite unknown, nor do I know any other instance in which the name of Shiran occurs either in Jewish or Arabic writers. Perhaps it should be 'O1:W *1':D, which means Said of Shirwan in Buchara, or '2'W of Shirin near Qarmisin in Media1, though it is hard to suppose that the name has been twice corrupted.

Another MS. of the Bodleian, ieb. f. 12, contains initer- alia in if. 9 b-44 b some chapters in the Hebrew language by the well-kniown Karaite religious philosopher of the eleventh century, viz.

For this reason Saadja translates ,'N', in Gen. i. to ver. 26 always by Nwi "andl he willed," othiers again are of opinioni that the divine word was spoken to the angels (for a full examination of this question see my work, Mose ,Ibn Clhiquitilla, p. I24), the view last menitioned is also shiared by al-Basir. Now the Karaites cite Gen. i. 14 as a proof that the beginning of the nmonth must be fixed by observation of the moon and not by com- puting the calendar (see e. g. Gan Eden trriny wiip pr, ? i . Therefore al-Basir asks if this passage be directed to the angels how can a com- mand for man be deduced from it ? The obvious reply would be that the passage is directed to aingels and to othiers besides. VOL.

The sense is, Saadja had assumed that the Calendar is very ancient (Responsa Geonim, ed.

If then, general rules can be subsequently formulated, the Calendar was obviously fixed. To this al-Basir replies: The remark of R. Chanina is a t,n, nsr and therefore is indecisive; while the second passage dates from the time when the Calendar was already fixed.

The whole of this passage is copied from an old book, and the superscription referring it to Josef al-Basir is unquestionable, as is clearly proved from parallel passages. Even the words beginning with riln:nn 1 Dnu t the copyist must have found in the old book referred to. and they cannot possibly have emanated from him himself. as is indeed evident from the two following reasons. First, it is very unlikely that a Karaite should, as late as the sixteenth century, still feel induced to write a polemic against Saadlja. It is true indeed. that even the later Karaites controverted Saadja in their writings, as for instance, Aaron the second and Elia Bashiatchi, but this happens only occasionally, and the polemical passages are for the most part. borrowed from their predecessors2. Secondly, after the end of the chapters by Josef al-Basir, a further passage by one Nathan b. Jehuda is found, also headed IW ')DD1 1hpWlln , and no doubt attaches to the identity of these two Nathans.

Perhaps the learned Librarian in Petersburg, Dr. A.

LEAVES FROM THE "GOLDEN BOUGH." ISAIAH lxvi. 17, '7rl3 inT 'rnlK. These words are an old puzzle. Canon Cheyne (Prophecies of Isaiah) observes, " Early Jewish critics felt that some reference was required to the deity in whose honour the mysteries were celebrated. ... Their general view seems confirmed by the common use of 'after' in technical religious phrases." He then refers the rites here described to the worship of Tammuz or Adonis. "But why should Adonis be called 'One'?" And again, in a footnote, discussing a conjecture of Lagarde, he says, " But no such name of a deity as 'ekhcidh has yet been found." A passage in Mr. Frazer's work, Aureus et foliis et lento vimine ramus, may perhaps supply the desideratum. It will be well, however, to prefix another extract from the same source, vol. I, p. 319: "So closely did the rites of Osiris resemble those of Adonis at Byblus, that some of the people of Byblus themselves maintained that it was Osiris and not Adonis whose death was mourned by them (Lucian, De dea Syria, 7). Such a view could certainly not have been held if the rituals of the two gods had not been so alike as to be almost indistinguishable." It is impossible, by any process of abridgment, to do justice to the sustained force, the lentum vimen, firm yet pliant, of Mr. Frazer's argument. The whole section on Osiris (Ibid. 301 et seq.) should be read. It must suffice to quote the following: "His character as a tree-spirit was represented very graphically in a ceremony described by Firmicus Maternus. A pine-tree was cut down, the centre was hollowed out, and with the wood thus excavated an image of Osiris was made, which was then 'buried' in the hollow of the tree. Here, again, it is hard to imagine how the conception of a tree as tenanted by a personal being could be mote plainly expressed. ... As to the pine-tree in particular, at Denderah the tree of Osiris is a conifer, and the coffer containing the body of Osiris is here represented as 704</page></plain_text>
