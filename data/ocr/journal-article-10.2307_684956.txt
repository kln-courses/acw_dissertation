They want to get beyond the style of thought that makes a clean split be- tween nature and society and then allots explanatory priority to one side or the other. They even want to get beyond an eclecticism that adds up natural and social factors. Instead, they want to help us see that nature and society are products of "conjoint constitution" in which each somehow gives rise to the other (361, 366-369, 372, 387). I strongly support this im- pulse, not just on technical grounds but disciplinary and political ones, too. It should be a central task of sociology to get clear on the specific contours of contemporary society, and it cannot do so without conceptualizing the intertwining of the social with the technoscientific knowledge, resources, and artifacts that make up much of our engagement with nature in the late 20th century. That said, I wonder if Freudenburg, Frickel, and Gramling (FFG, from now on) have accomplished their purpose. Their parting remark is that "It may be necessary . . . to recognize or to believe in the potential for mutual contingency, or the conjoint constitution of the physical and the social, before it is possible to see the ways in which the two are interrelated. Without progress in achieving such insights ... we run the risk of having our vision distorted by the very taken-for-grantedness of our socially agreed-upon definitions-the risk of being prisoners of our own perspec- tives" (388). And I am not sure that FFG went as far as they could in helping us escape the prison. In what follows, I explain why I feel that 1Department of Sociology, University of Illinois, 326 Lincoln Hall, 702 S.

I also try to find a way of reexpressing some of their material to make their points more sharply. I emphasize that this essay aims to strengthen and clarify FFG's arguments and conclusions. It is a friendly critique.2 FFG's concern is with a geographical feature on the Michigan-Wis- consin border presently known as Iron Mountain. They state that the moun- tain has not changed much materially over the years, but they observe that representations and uses of it have, establishing this point by dividing its history into five phases (374-386): (1) before European settlement, the re- gion of the mountain was home to the Menominee, who understood it to be "hunting grounds and living space" though it was also of spiritual sig- nificance; (2) in the early 19th century, the first European settlers saw the mountain as both a source of timber and a geographical inconvenience; (3) from the 1860s onward, the mountain was seen not as a source of timber but of iron ore; but (4) the mines went bust in the 20th century; and (5) since the late 1950s, the mountain has become a tourist attraction. So, if Iron Mountain as a physical feature of the land has been pretty constant over the centuries, the way it has struck human beings, and been used by them, has not. The question, then, is, what are we to make of that? FFG's favored conclusion is that "both the physical characteristics of Iron Mountain and the ongoing changes in society and technology played significant roles in shaping the human uses that proved possible and/or likely," and that "while it is possible to separate the physical from the social in terms of analytic convenience, it is important to recognize that the social is inherent in what is usually seen as the physical, just as the physical is often integral to what is perceived as the social" (386, original emphasis). Now, I think that these are valuable formulations. The symmetry they make between the physical and the social is what I take to be important about FFG's notion of conjoint constitution. But my worry is that FFG's handling of their example is less symmetric than these formulations suggest. In par- ticular, the social tends to feature in FFG's account as the independent vari- able that, so to speak, calls the shots. There is little in their discussion of the five phases to resist the argument that when society changes, then and therefore representations and uses of the mountain change. The Menomi- nee have their own form of life, and appropriate the mountain accordingly; then come the loggers, who do the same; then the miners; and so on. Of course, you cannot have loggers without trees, so in this sense "the physical characteristics of Iron Mountain . . . played significant roles in shaping the 2I refereed the first version of FFG's essay, and adumbrated some of the ideas and concerns expressed here. I elaborate them now at the editor's invitation. 154 Pickering</page><page sequence="3">Further Beyond the Divide human uses that proved possible," but still, the loggers could have gone somewhere else if there had not been any trees there. The impression one can easily get from FFG's paper is therefore that the social was not itself at stake in the history of Iron Mountain in the same way as representations and uses of the mountain were. And this asymmetry, I think, is the weak link in FFG's chain of argumentation. If the social is not at stake in our dealings with nature, then we can go on doing traditional dualist sociology, treating the social as a pure category, with its own regularities and dynamics that a pure discipline of sociology studies; and we can simply add to that, if we like, the idea that the social somehow projects out certain descriptions and uses of nature.3 This is not the position that FFG intend us to arrive at, so, to resist it, I now want to rearrange and amplify part of FFG's ex- ample. FFG's essay is prone to an asymmetric reading because, I think, they do not care enough about the social. They show how representations and uses of Iron Mountain have changed in relation to social changes, but they pay remarkably little attention to how the social itself has changed.4 The five different states of society just appear, without further analysis, in their essay-the Menominee appear before us, perform and exit stage right; then the first settlers, and so on. An asymmetry is thus built into FFG's treat- ment of their example, and it is, I think, an important source of their dif- ficulties in getting their idea of the conjoint constitution of society and nature across. If this point is accepted, then the remedy is clear: if we want to get clear on the conjoint constitution of society and nature, we have to look at the reciprocal interplay between the two. We have to be just as interested in the nature of social change as we are in the way that social change plays itself out in our dealings with nature. We have to be symmet- ric. And one particular phase of the history of Iron Mountain strikes me as an appealing site to cash this idea out, namely the iron-mining era. As FFG show, production of iron ore at Iron Mountain got started in the 1860s and reached a peak around 1900 before declining to zero in the 1940s. And an obvious sociological commentary on this would be an asymmetric one. In the second half of the 19th century, American society developed an intense appetite for iron, largely by virtue of the "tremendous railroad expansion" (380), and this new appetite played itself out in a re- 3It does not help that FFG's heading for their discussion of the five phases is "The Meanings of a Mountain" (372). "Meaning" is a classical term of art in the construction of a pure and asymmetric sociology: on the one hand, there is nature in the raw, to be studied by natural scientists and engineers, and, on the other, there is the universe of distinctively human "meanings," to be studied by sociologists, etc. 4An irony here is that in their long footnote 5, FFG insist that they "do wish to understand society itself" (368, original emphasis), apparently thinking this contrasts with actor-network theory and my own work on the mangle (see the works cited in note 7 below). 155</page><page sequence="4">valuation of Iron Mountain. Now, it would be foolish to suggest that this story is simply wrong, but it does seem to me that it is misleading. Most obviously, the trajectory of development of U.S. society would appear to have been quite strongly coupled to the fate of Iron Mountain. FFG state that "the Menominee mines produced one-seventh of all the total iron ore in the United States in 1890" (382). It therefore seems safe to say that had Iron Mountain not turned out to be capable of yielding massive quantities of iron ore, the railroad expansion and all of the social transformations that went with it-industrialization, urbanization, the rise of the robber bar- ons, and so on-could have happened only at a significantly slower pace. And this observation points to the sensibility I want to convey-that the social was itself at stake in the history of Iron Mountain. United States society became something-interconnected by rail, industrialized, urban- ized-in one and the same process as Iron Mountain became a major source of iron ore. The two becomings hung together, reinforced one an- other, interactively stabilized one another, as I would put it. Of course, FFG and the readers of this journal are well aware of the social aspect of this process, but I find it a weakness that FFG did not think to mention it in their essay. Explicit recognition that the social is itself at stake in the definition and exploitation of natural resources is surely one of the keys to a symmetric understanding of the conjoint constitution of nature and society. To continue this line of thought, I can note that FFG frequently refer to connections between technological innovations and the exploitation of Iron Mountain. For instance, discussing the largest of the mines, they com- ment that "The 'D' shaft of the Chapin mine actually had to be sunk through quicksand, an accomplishment made possible by new refrigeration technology that could literally freeze the ground, from surface to ledgerock, with a system of pipes and coils containing calcium chloride and com- pressed ammonia" (382).5 This is an important observation, but again FFG's commentary on it fails to lead where it should. Thus they remark that the relevant technologies were "developed by social actors" and that "these changes, in turn, altered the definition of what iron ores, in what locations, could be considered by (historically specific) 'rational' standards to have the greatest economic value" (381). This formulation is a rhetorical SAccording to FFG, other technological innovations that were important for Iron Mountain in this period were a steam-powered core-drilling rig (380), the Bessemer steel-making process (380-381), the railroad (in providing access to the Iron Mountain reserves, as well as creating a demand for them) (380), a massive "Cornish Pumping Engine" (382), further developments in steel-making that required ores of low silica content (383), and new techniques of strip-mining (384). All of these could be discussed along the lines sketched out below. 156 Pickering</page><page sequence="5">Further Beyond the Divide mistake. It puts all the weight back on the human, the social, and the ra- tional, and sits too easily with the idea that the social structures the tech- nological, which then functions as a proxy for the social in projecting out certain features of nature. We quickly find ourselves back with the social as the independent variable and the asymmetry that FFG want to tran- scend. In contrast, to thematize the conjoint constitution of the physical and the social here one needs to emphasize the materiality of technology-the fact that technology, like natural resources, cannot simply be absorbed into the category of the social. One needs to recognize that all those pipes and compressors and liquid ammonia and calcium chloride actually did things, there on Iron Mountain, in a way that was irreducible to the powers of naked human beings (individually or collectively). This observation seems incon- testable, and it points to a further sense in which the social did not call of the shots around Iron Mountain-the future contours of the social de- pended not only upon what material resources the mountain would prove to provide, but also upon "material agency": what specific technologies would prove to be capable of doing.6 If on-site refrigeration had not made it possible to mine through quicksand, then Iron Mountain would not have been such a major source of ore, and social transformations would not have evolved around it as they did. In the end, then, we need to think of a triple becoming: of Iron Mountain as a specific natural resource, of specific ma- terial technologies connected with the extraction and use of iron ore, and of specific lines of evolution in U.S. society. All three of these becomings hung together and reinforced one another, with none having explanatory priority over the others. Seen from this angle, then, the social is no longer a pure, self-contained category-no longer is it the independent variable that structures others (technology, fields of natural resources). Instead, the social itself evolves in an impure relation to the extrasocial: technologies as material agents, nature as resource. This, in the end, is the point that I would stress to convey FFG's notion of "conjoint constitution." One last remark. The force of the preceding discussion depends upon counterfactual assertions: without refrigeration (and other technological in- novations), Iron Mountain would have counted less as a source of iron; without Iron Mountain (and a few places like it) the late 19th-century trans- formation of U.S. society would have been different. I have few qualms about this: it is hard to doubt the counterfactuals in question. But still, the 6FFG profess to finding talk of material agency "relatively circuitous and logically dangerous (if 'thrilling')" (368). Actually, it is entirely prosaic, except within the pure social science disciplines that have stipulated definitions of "agency" such that only human beings can be agents-thus sedimenting the asymmetry FFG want to transcend and legitimating ridiculous imputations of "anthropomorphism" (368) against other usages of the term. 157</page><page sequence="6">word "counterfactual" sends shivers down the spine. It is a term of art in traditional philosophy, and invites endless sterile debate. So let me point out that there is a way of attenuating the dependence on counterfactuals. It is to pay close attention to the evolution of practice in time-something, again, which FFG do not do. If one were to look in detail at activities around Iron Mountain during the rail boom, one would surely find count- less microadjustments of social roles and relations, adjustments to the array of technologies deployed, and reassessments of the mountain as resource. And, this is my bet, one would see that people were experimenting with all three at once, usually failing to align these heterogeneous elements pro- ductively but sometimes succeeding. At this level of detail, therefore, docu- mentation would substitute for counterfactual argument. Or, if one prefers the macro, one could imagine surveying social and material developments in the large. One would aim to comprehend the many nascent vectors of extension of American society in this period, the many tentative lines of technological innovation, the disparate fields of potential natural resources they conjured up, and again one would explore how all these processes defined and redefined-resisted and accommodated, mangled as I would say-each other's temporal trajectories. In this way, one might arrive at a macro vision of how society has evolved under an impure dynamics, along- side and in interaction with fields of technology and natural resources. My suggestion is, therefore, that besides a conscious interest in transformations of the social, we also need a well-developed sense of time if we are to get beyond the nature/society divide.7 REFERENCES Callon, M. 1986 "Some elements of a sociology of translation: Domestication of the scallops and the fishermen of St. Brieuc Bay."
