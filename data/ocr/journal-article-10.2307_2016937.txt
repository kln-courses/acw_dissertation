New York: The Mac- millan Co. 1929. Pp. viii + 185. The biological standpollnt in psychology has been very fruitful, but the blessing has not been unmixed. It has done much to make psychology scientific by rescuing mind from the metaphysical bog of the subjective or psychical, and by placing it in the behavior of the organism. This is a step in the right direction, but it is a bad halting place. In identifying mind with the brain and central nervous system, the neurologist has set up one abstraction in place</page><page sequence="2">494 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY of another. He has failed to bring mind back to nature where it belongs, where in interaction with an environment it acquires its characteristic properties and functions, and where in integrated form it is observed. In breaking with the philosophical tradition, the psychologist has too easily accepted the conclusion that he can be scientific only by following the lead of the natural sciences. In taking over their method at its face value, he has tended to confine his study to their content, and hence has overlooked the social, insti- tutional, and technological aspects of his problem, or has assigned to them a quite subsidiary place. To study social psychology, one has to consider whether to go to philosophy, sociology, or psychology. Mr. Herrick's book is a case in point. He is determined not to allow science to compromise with philosophy. Hence he inquires how far we can understand human nature by the methods of natural science. Now instead of assuming that science deals with those relations between events which are sufficiently constant to enable us to take the one set of events as means to the other set as consequences, he assumes that the entire process of events, or nature, is a mechan- ism. Either "human nature is machine-made," or there is "no real science of human biology." Before being swallowed by biology, as here interpreted, psychology might profitably consider the meaning of causal laws in current physical science. Quantum physics and the Heisenberg principle of indeterminacy, as Eddington and many others have pointed out, have forced the conclusion that causal laws are either identical propositions, "put-up jobs," or are statistical laws, concerned with groups rather than with individuals, predic- tions of the probability of observable events. The theory that our world is completely mechanistic, or deterministic, breaks down in two respects. It erroneously assumes, first, that science is concerned with individuals rather than with what Lillie has called the generic relations between individuals, and second, a complete knowledge of the past. The first assumption is being widely challenged, and the second, as Mead and others have shown, involves a self-contradiction. Mr. Herriek realizes that the conventional notion of mechanism is unsatisfactory, and he devotes considerable space to the contention that mechanisms are creative, that they bring forth novelties, and that they are indispensable to choice, purpose, and value. iHe holds no brief for materialism or for any other metaphysical standpoint. He distrusts the injection into scienee of mysticism, vitalism, and philosophical theories in general. The scientific way of life is here presented at its best. Things and ideals meet on common ground. To those whose philosophy, like the reviewer's, is heavily grounded in the scientific point of view, and who have been disappointed in the philosophical conclusions which men like Eddington and Millikan</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 495 have claimed to reach on scientific premises, this thesis has great promise. But does Mr. Herrick really mean what he says? In order to differentiate the notion of mechanism from the philo- sophical conception of orgailism, and yet reconcile the notion with the obvious facts of experience, he vacillates between two inter- pretations. Too much of the time, he emphasizes the uniformity of nature, identifies mechanism with a standardized product, claims that under identical conditions the same things happen, and that "the internal work of the mechanism determines the product made by the machine." He does not seem to see that the dispute arises precisely because evolution is inconsistent with identical conditions; identical conditions do recur, but so far as they do there is no evolution. At other times he meets this difficulty by claiming that the way a machine acts depends not only upon the nature of the machine, but also upon the coniditions affecting and transforming it. But this is exactly what the critics of mechanism have contended, and the argu- ment becomes a matter of the proper use of words. The miechanical character of a process stops precisely where novel, creative, then un- predictable aspects of the process emierge. A process is mechanistic, as the author rightly contends, in affording the basis for colntrol, but for that very reason novel features are not mechanistic because they can not be predicted from a knowledge of the elements then given. To answer that these novel aspects are determined, for they are found to be so in a later situation, is to confuse that situation with the earlier one. It will not help to say that nothing comes uncaused, and that in the earlier situation the defect is inadequate knowledge of the mechanism. The statement is based on a confusion of two radically different meanings of the word "cause." All nature is causal in the sense that it is a sequential order, a process; looking backward on this order, to deny caprice is simply to say that things have happened as they did happen. The results could not have been different, giveni the conditions, because the results were part of the conditions. But in the sense of cause which is important for science, it is identified with antecedents which enable us to predict conse- quences, and in this sense creative or novel elements are not caused and not mechanical. The book is divided into four parts, the first dealing with mechanistic science, the second, with mechanistic biology, the third, with mechanistic psychology, and the last, with human nature. Psy- chology is defined as "the science which deals with conscious ex- perience, with our awareness of what is going on." Mr. Herrick's general statement is very good, for it seems to distinguish psychology from biology as the direct experience differs from the biological con- ditions of that experience. The detailed analysis, however, pretty</page><page sequence="4">496 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY much reduces psychology to biology in the conclusion that the body, particularly the cerebral cortex, is the organ of thinking. It is sig- nificant that in the course of the exposition it becomes necessary to qualify this statement with the assertion that "some of my con- sciousness, particularly simple emotional experienee, is not cortical but visceral and thalamic," and that in one place language is said to be an aid to the cerebrum. Motor patterns are recognized as of more importance in our thinking than was formerly supposed, but motor patterns, we are reminded, are not thought. Social psy- chology, sticking to the direct field of experience, might be called upon here to slhow how sounds and other gestures become meanings or significant symnbols in the development of social behavior. But what for the social psychologist might be regarded as the unique mnechlanism of thought, is of course for the biologist simply the stimulus to the action of the cerebral mechanism. Like The Thinking Machine, What is the Mind? is written for the ordinary reader, aims to slhow that science is compatible with pur- poses and values, and that understanding of the former is necessary to the intelligent appreciation and direction of the latter. Where Mr. Herrick's book essays a detailed analysis of his subject, sticking closely to what he recgards as the scientific point of view, Mr. Patrick's book takes an finpressionistic iniventory of the salient general points of view, and is avowedly conycerlned with their philosophical impli- cations. Though AMr. HIerrick refers approvingly to Mr. Patrick's book, it will not, in my opinion, meet the approval of most scientists or of psychologists. But it is a useful and readable work for the general reader, fairly successful in the modest job it attempts. The two standpoints considered are that of behaviorism within psychology, and that of organicisml within philosophy. The general thesis is that the latter has done much to redeem the inadequacies of the former in correcting its materialistic implications. A fairly safe middle path is steered between the mechanistic position that mind is a function of the nervous system, and the. vitalistic position that mind is something introduced into the natural process from the outside. Occasionally extravagant statements are made which indicate that the author is momentarily more interested in saving values than in understanding the facts, as when in criticizing behaviorism he says, "If it threatened the reality of the mind, it would be doomed forth- with, for this reality is self-evident. It is the mind that rules the world and makes things go." On the other hand, effective criticism of extreme forms of behaviorism is made from the standpoint of physical science in its newer theories of the atom as an organism. Furthermore, the reduction of function to structure, or vice versa, is shown to be untenable.</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 497 The finial chapter is interesting in showing how the author stands when it comes to a show-down. He is clearly not a mechanist, though he appreciates the part which mechanism plays in organization. He is not a vitalist, for lie sees that you don 't explain the evolution of mind by positing it to begin with. He insists that evolution is not an unfolding or unwrapping of what is potentially or implicitly there. It is genuinely creative, developmental. The final conclu- sion, however, is a bit strange and disappointing. Following the lead of emergent evolution and kindred standpoints, he concludes "that there are certain formiative forces at work in the world and that organization is the product of these forces and not of chance groupings of inert elements." It is also concluded that under the guidance of these formative forces evolution issues in organisms of a higher and higher order, reaching their summit in the human mind. Both these conclusions seem to me fanciful and sadly in want of evidence. Lloyd Morgan, whose position is essentially that taken by the author, was careful to point out that the first conielusion belongs to emergent evolution only as philosophic faith and goes beyond any scientific evidence. The second conclusion evidences an amazing faculty, anthropomorphic in the extreme, for seeing in the evolutionary process the favorable and progressive features that the author wants to see. To appreciate the short-sighted perspective of the argument, the reader should go to Edmund Noble's book, Purposive Evolution. DONALD A. PIATT. THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS.</page></plain_text>
