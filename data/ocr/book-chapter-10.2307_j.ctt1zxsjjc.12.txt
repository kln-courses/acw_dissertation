<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— VIII: Fellow Travelers:  Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism  For nearly the whole route I did not depart from the  devoted Mtkvari, you would think that the Mtkvari was  also one of our fellow travelers!1 In his earliest travels in 1878, Bavreli finds himself two fellow travelers:  a Russian chinovnik and the “devoted” Mtkvari River, which flows along  their route. As fellow travelers, the Russian chinovnik (bureaucrat) and  the Georgian river each stand as figures for imagined horizons against  which Bavreli constitutes himself as a “traveler.” Against these horizons  the landscape they traverse comes to have very different, mutually un- intelligible meanings. Like most of the Georgian travelers of his time,  Bavreli is an ambivalent traveler, never traveling very far from “home.”  Accordingly, Bavreli defines his own travel as being local by providing  himself with two kinds of fellow travelers: human and nonhuman. On  the one hand, the extremely circumscribed space-time of his own trav- els are defined in opposition to the space-times that define the rather  more cosmopolitan journeys of his human (Russian, Georgian, Arme- nian) fellow travelers, variously defined in terms of imperial service,  military campaigns, or long-distance trade. On the other hand, Bavreli  personifies the landscape of the locality itself, particularly the rivers,  the Mtkvari and the Choroxi, which, after all, like him, travel, but always  with respect to a concrete and determinate landscape. By emphasizing  his difference from these cosmopolitan human fellow travelers and  his kinship with his local nonhuman fellow travelers, Bavreli valorizes  a specific form of travel, a travel that is circumscribed by locality and  nature. This chapter seeks to locate this self-consciously Georgian form  of travel and traveler in relation to other “European” forms of travel  and fellow travelers against which Georgian travelers self-consciously  defined themselves, as well as the different space-times in which Geor- gians traveled: localist travel within Georgia, archaeological travels into  the Georgian past, Occidentalist travels into the European future, and  finally, Bavreli’s own Orientalist travels in Ottoman Georgia. — 251 — </page> <page sequence="2"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— We return to Bavreli’s early travels by the banks of the Mtkvari. Even  as Bavreli and the Russian chinovnik travel together through the same  concrete landscape, they experience these places as being part of very  different journeys. For his fellow traveler, this place, by the banks of  the Mtkvari in Georgia, is simply one of many more or less equivalent  places he might have been appointed, equivalent because they are far  from the imperial metropole: “my fellow traveler had recently finished  school and they had appointed him for service ‘somewhere’ [sadghac]  and he was on his way to this ‘somewhere’ . . .” The Russian traveler  experiences “here” as a vague and indefinite “somewhere”; somewhere  in an empire of more or less equivalent somewheres, somewhere where  someone like him, whose travels form a career defined by his service to  empire and the boundaries of that empire, has been sent to serve. The  chinovnik is one of those Andersonian absolutist functionaries, whose  travels, indeed whose life, is a career path that is defined at the intersec- tion by algebraic variables of rank (chini) and place, producing senses of  abstract equivalence between fellow travelers based on this very same  algebra of rank and place: Sent out to a township A at rank V, he may return to the  capital at rank W; proceed to province B at rank X; con- tinue to vice-royalty C at rank Y; and end his pilgrimage  in the capital at rank Z. . . . The last thing the functionary  wants is to return home for he has no home with any  intrinsic value. And this: on his upward-spiralling road  he encounters as eager fellow pilgrims his functionary  colleagues, from places and families he has scarcely  heard of and surely hopes never to have to see. But in ex- periencing them as travelling-companions, a conscious- ness of connectedness (‘Why are we . . . here . . . together’)  emerges (Anderson 1991, 55–6) But no such consciousness of connectedness is obtained between  this chinovnik and Bavreli, who is not such a fellow variable within the  abstract algebra of empire. In fact, it is precisely because of their differ- ences that they value each other as fellow travelers. Bavreli admits to  the reader that he is happy that his fellow traveler is chiniani (“having  rank,” that is, an official) since this will simplify his own travels consid- — 252 — </page> <page sequence="3"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— erably; the fact of the matter is that Bavreli lacks the funds necessary  for travel. For his part, the chinovnik admits that he values Bavreli’s  company precisely because he is a “local” (akauri, one from “here”), who  can explain aspects of the locality to him.2 For Bavreli, what the chi- novnik experiences as a somewhat vague and indifferent “somewhere”  is strongly centered as a familiar “here,” near his home and his travels,  for the most part, are in and around his home region. In fact, in these  very “travel notes,” Bavreli is “traveling” (if we can call it that) home,3  to the very village, Bavra, near Axalcixe, near the border with Ottoman  Georgia, from which he takes his nom de plume, to his home, “in the  house of a poor peasant.”4 On his journey on the Ottoman Georgian river Choroxi, too, Bavreli  casts a sideward glance at the very different itineraries that separate him  from his human fellow travelers—including a Georgian nobleman, an  Armenian merchant, and a pair of Russian officers—even as he shares  the same boat along the same river with them. In a manner that recalls  Chavchavadze’s alignment of himself with Lelt Ghunia, Bavreli aligns  himself with the Ottoman boatman, who agrees to take him on the  journey for a lesser rate of four rubles, because, as he says in his heavily  Ottomanized Georgian, dutifully transcribed, as always, by Bavreli:  ‘bahli (diax [Yes]) I will take you. Hama (magram [but])  gurji (kartveli [Georgian]) ki (rom [if]) you were not, I  would not have taken you at that bahat (pasat [price])]’5 Despite the great difference between their dialects, the boatman’s  sense of a kind of kinship with a Gurji like Bavreli reflected concretely  in the lower price of passage, in contrast with one of the other travel- ers, an Armenian merchant, who, as it turns out, must end up paying a  higher-than-normal price.6 The Georgian nobleman and the Armenian  merchant turn out to be old acquaintances, and Bavreli reports their  overheard conversation at length.7 From characteristic details of dress,  movement, down to the macaronic Russian-and-Armenian-inflected  speech of the merchant, it becomes clear that these two are almost  comic stereotypical representatives of their species, their presence  pointing to very different itineraries, very different worlds of motiva- tion that divide them even as they share the same boat. The Georgian  nobleman, who served at the front at Kars, deep inside Ottoman Geor- — 253 — </page> <page sequence="4"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— gia, is returning home to Poti via Batumi. The Armenian merchant is go- ing to Istanbul via Batumi. The Armenian merchant, who plays the role  of comic sidekick to the Georgian nobleman, complains that his noble  friend’s journeys expanding the boundaries of empire are defined by a  motivation of chini (“rank”), a motivation he does not understand, for  his own extra-imperial travels are defined by money, he frankly admits:  “t’o [Armenian-derived familiar address term] All you talk about is ranks  (chini), tell me, did you make any money?”8 Yet for all their differences,  these two yet represent, like Bavreli, a kind of “local,” in contrast to the  other two travelers, Russian officers, one of whom is a dissolute drunk,  with red eyes from loss of sleep from playing cards and drinking, a pic- ture of absolute indifference to the journey which arbitrarily brings him  to yet another arbitrary “somewhere” in the Russian Empire, and hence  spends much of the journey playing cards with the other officer and the  merchant.9 Each of these fellow travelers is an emissary from a different  space-time, grounded in the horizons of different imaginaries and mo- tivations, against which Bavreli can define himself as a “local” traveler.  Fellow travelers are defined not only by comparability of their concep- tion of how the same or similar objective itinerary maps onto the wider  phenomenological and motivational horizons of their travels (“space- time”), but also by the comparability of their subjective aestheticized  reactions to the landscape with those of other travelers. Along a well- traveled itinerary, such as the Dariel pass which everyone must cross  who wishes to go from Russia to Georgia, one is never alone; there is no  dearth of literary fellow travelers for a writer like Chavchavadze to keep  him company. But Bavreli has no literary fellow travelers with whom to  share his aesthetic appreciation of the sublime, the picturesque, and the  beautiful in the landscape, he only has his Russian chinovnik, and there  is nothing comparable in the thoughts of these two. Enraptured by the  natural landscape along the banks of the Mtkvari River, Bavreli imagines  another traveler, who is also a painter, who, however rushed he might be,  still he would tarry involuntarily to paint the landscape on paper: —imagine an isle, which divides the Mtkvari in two, a  bridge crosses one branch of the Mtkvari from the bank  to the isle, between whose abutments the Mtkvari runs  seething with foam; a little further there is an old fort  on a high cliff, to the right a village spreads out, a pretty  — 254 — </page> <page sequence="5"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— forest and gardens, wild plum trees blooming with new  flowers like white cotton and many similar decorations  of nature. But oh! I, unfortunate one, where can I, with  my weak pen, describe the beauty of my motherland!10  But his reverie is interrupted by his actual fellow traveler, the chi- novnik, who raises his voice to scatter his “sweet thoughts,” which turn  on speculations about the quantity and type of game animals that can  be found in the local forests.  The two travelers share the same road, even the same cart, but their  minds are in different worlds. In contrast to the Russian chinovnik,  Bavreli’s private thoughts and nature seem in harmony, a harmony  which is figured by the Mtkvari River, who had been until just now  merely a salient feature of the natural landscape along the route, but  now becomes an anthropomorphized, yet inarticulate fellow traveler, a  familiar old acquaintance from his youth, whose mood here, however,  has changed; here the river is unfamiliar, troubled, and angry: What my fellow traveler was thinking, where his thoughts  were running to, I do not know even now; mine however  were flying very far and to such a place, for which I would  sacrifice my whole youth for this moment; if only this  thought and dream were to come true, I would have  considered myself the most blessed of beings. . . . The  cooing of the Mtkvari led us from temporary sleep. Oh  how it made me happy, when I saw my old acquaintance  and friend, the Mtkvari! It made me happy, but what to  do, because this no longer was that Mtkvari, which I had  seen in my boyhood—It now longer seemed to have that  purity, that freshness, that peacefulness. The agitated  Mtkvari was running along so angrily and so wrathfully  grumbled, that my heart almost broke. That is the mat- ter and misfortune, that I couldn’t understand and do  not know, what was the reason for its trouble. . . . I asked  its beautiful banks ‘why, why is it so angry?’—There was  no one to answer.11  The Mtkvari moves from being a stable aesthetic figure connecting  — 255 — </page> <page sequence="6"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— the natural beauty of the landscape along the journey, to an anthropo- morphic figure, a moody and inarticulate fellow traveler. The Mtkvari is  also a literary intertextual figure, allowing Bavreli to compare his travels  here beside the Mtkvari to literary travelers like Chavchavadze else- where beside the Terek. Like the Terek for Chavchavadze, the anthro- pomorphic Mtkvari as fellow traveler stands for Bavreli’s own organic  connection as local and intelligent to the landscape and by extension,  its people (in contrast to the official, who represents a competing field  of imperial elites for the local intelligentsia). This is the same Mtkvari  which Bavreli elsewhere (above) contrasts to the Choroxi, a semifabu- lous river which has become unfamiliar, and speaks in a strange, foreign  accented voice, a figure for Ottoman Georgia, a river which is pictured  as saying farewell to the familiar cliffs of its headwaters as it heads away  into Ottoman Georgia, much as the population of Ottoman Georgia are  leaving their homes en masse fleeing the Russian conquest. In explicit  comparison and contrast to Chavchavadze’s anthropomorphic, sublime  Terek, Bavreli refashions the Mtkvari into a patriotic Georgian, who  refuses to go abroad, who refuses, in effect, to travel at all: However angry the Mtkvari may be, still I love it. While  the Terek brings many into rapture with its noise and  terrible rush, with its richly adorned banks and it awak- ened many feelings in people, but no, I don’t love that;  I came to hate the Terek without seeing it, for the Terek  is not devoted to the fatherland, as is the Mtkvari. The  Terek runs off from the fatherland into foreign countries  and beautifies the lands of others, and not our own . . .  I love the Mtkvari because it is self-sacrificing and de- voted to the fatherland.12  If the Terek is two-faced and treacherous (again recalling Chavcha- vadze’s characterization), seeking to go to foreign lands, the Mtkvari  is devoted and patriotic, a river that flows through and for Georgia  alone. Just as Chavchavadze used the figure of the Terek River to make  geopoetic arguments and invoke oppositions of imaginative geography,  such as that between Europe and Asia, Georgia and the Caucasus, so  Bavreli extends this language of rivers both to intertextually link his  own travels here to those of a more famous aristocratic writer elsewhere  — 256 — </page> <page sequence="7"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— and to extend this imaginative geography in space into Ottoman Geor- gia, producing a threefold opposition between the Mtkvari (the familiar  European Georgia), the Choroxi (the alienated Ottoman Georgia), and  the Terek (the Caucasus, or perhaps the cosmopolitan imperial space of  a chinovnik in Russian service like the man seated next to him, includ- ing many Georgian chinovniks and even Russian-educated Georgians  [the original meaning of tergdaleuli] like Chavchavadze himself besides)  (see map 2 for the locations of these three rivers).  But the comparison has an unintended reading, too: the Mtkvari  could be taken as a figure for “travel” in the Georgian sense, at least the  Terek, and the Choroxi too, is a traveler in the normal sense, it seeks out  foreign lands, but the Mtkvari never goes anywhere at all. The Mtkvari as  “fellow traveler” is a figure for the predicament of the Georgian traveler,  who travels but does not ever leave Georgia, a river whose circulation  is like the circulation of Georgian travel writers, circulating within the  imagined unity of Georgia. Bavreli and the Mtkvari are fellow travelers  through much of their travels, though neither could be said to “travel”  since they are never very far from home.  Traveling Home: The Localist Georgian Traveler Like the Mtkvari River itself, Georgian travel writers seem to be loath  to actually leave Georgia. No better illustration of this tendency can be  found than the inaugural call for submissions for the popular journal  Mogzauri (“Traveler”) which reads in part: The editors of Mogzauri asks lovers of Georgian history- archeology, and geography—ethnography, to send to  the editors articles of general interest about the history,  archeology, geography and ethnography of Georgia.13 As one contemporary commentator noted, to illustrate his point  that “the contemporary Georgian does not like to travel, he doesn’t like  looking around as does a European”: “We could not get used to travel- ing. Just consider we even founded the journal Mogzauri, but not even  it could make us love traveling.”14 Georgians are defined in opposition  to Europeans as the local to the cosmopolitan, those who stay at home  versus those who travel. — 257 — </page> <page sequence="8"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— Georgian travel seems to be a contradiction in terms. The feuilleton- ist Sano tried his hand at writing a letter of his travel from Tbilisi to  Baku. He begins by discussing his title: Feuilleton --- Notes of a Georgian Traveler (From Tbilisi to Baku) I made up this title on purpose for today’s letter. Were  I to have written only ‘Notes of a Traveler’, the readers  would think that some real traveler had really aimed at  some scientific or social idea and intended such a jour- ney to investigate it, as European travelers are wont to  do for us.15 Sano is not a real traveler, a European traveler, but a Georgian one,  just as this is not a real travel letter but a feuilleton. As a feuilleton  version of a traveler letter then, meandering digression is the order  of the day, every ancillary topic is covered, everything pertaining to  the journey except the journey itself. We do not hear so much about  the landscape as about its absence: everything the writer might have  wanted to see cannot be seen; the journey for some reason is always at  night, so one can see little or nothing from the windows; the railway  itself is so devised as to wind a tortuous path through remote and de- serted places, avoiding each potentially interesting human settlement  by a number of miles, so that even important cities like Ganja (unless  you actually go out of your way to see it on purpose) only appear in the  distance from the railway station “only as about ten dim candles and  lamps and nothing more.”16 The price of the ticket, too, almost double  what it should be, is blamed on the no doubt sublime, but invisible,  mountainous landscape which the route is at pains to avoid: “It is the  fault of Mount Kazbek and Elbrus, that you pay 12 roubles to Baku  instead of six, you arrive from Tbilisi into Baku, in such a way that you  can’t see even one mountain ridge.”17 But as the title warns, this journey which is not a journey is made  by a travel writer who is not a travel writer (but a feuilletonist) and,  indeed, not a real European traveler, but a Georgian traveler. And here  — 258 — </page> <page sequence="9"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— is the greatest oxymoron, as the reader, surely, will already know, the  main thing about contemporary Georgian travelers is that there is no  such thing: So as to not raise a false hope in the reader, I just now  added in, that the traveler is a Georgian man, and you  will be aware, won’t you, how our urbane fellow-coun- tryman travels. I should have said in the title, that this  Georgian traveler was “of our times”, so that it would be  even clearer, with whom the reader is dealing, but the  title came out too ugly and long and for this reason in  the manuscript itself I am informing you of this quality  of the traveler.18 The Georgian traveler is neither the familiar figure of the serious,  scientific European traveler nor the Georgian traveler of old, when appar- ently, long ago, Georgians used to be of a more curious and cosmopolitan  nature, believing themselves to be part of humanity in general and there- fore loving knowledge, and accordingly, Georgians used to travel to far-off  places in the East: “In this old times, as I was saying, we see the Georgian  man not only in Persia, but Afghanistan, India, China, and elsewhere. He  goes there to pray or to make war or to trade, he remains one, three, ten  years. He sees many new things, new relationships, different wonders  of nature and then, armed with new knowledge and experience, returns  to his homeland, and imparts his mental treasury to friends and strang- ers.”19 Travel for the contemporary Georgian traveler is nothing quite so  bold, and its aims are much more modest. “Travel” and “traveler” are used,  Sano says, when someone puts on a coat and hat and sets out on the road,  “from let’s say, a small village to a large village or a city. The distance trav- eled will be from 30 to 60 versts [kilometers, more or less].”20  The distance traveled by the contemporary Georgian “traveler” are  modest, and so are his goals. Much of the time this travel is forced upon  the unwilling traveler, who must travel to the office of some police su- perintendent in a larger village or city by some specific date on some  bureaucratic or police matter, lest they have to make a much longer trip  to Siberia. If the reasons for such travel are not understandable to the  traveler, at least there is a reason the reader will understand. But what  of voluntary travel? What is its point? — 259 — </page> <page sequence="10"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— But for the most part Georgian travel means meander- ing from one place to the next, pointlessly, for no reason.  The only reason for travel is for Georgian man to show  his in-laws his abilities, for example . . . to annihilate  their wine. It could be that he has in-laws or friends who  live at a distance, but the Georgian man nevertheless  will dare to travel, so he can ascertain in detail, what  quality of wine they have. This is typically the main goal,  that a Georgian man leaves off his own supra and goes to  the supra of others to devour everything. . . . Our fellow  countryman returns from far travels and all his reminis- cences are where he drank how many stakans [glasses]  and q’anc’i [drinking horns] on Monday, who did he com- pete with in drinking wine on Tuesday . . .21 The Georgian man does not travel to learn, to find out new things,  to learn the good and bad aspects of himself or others; his desire for  new knowledge “is apparently buried in some deep gorge somewhere.”  As a result, it is no wonder “why we do not have any descriptions of not  only of other countries, but of our own homeland,” and all the while  foreigners from God knows where “practically kill themselves to see our  lovely country . . . at the same time our Georgian man, however, often  only knows his own village and those places which can be seen from this  village and which his eye can reach.”22 Thus, to the Georgian, slumber- ing in his own backyard, all the “wondrous victories of human ingenu- ity” in this age of mechanical wonders, like the use of steam-powered  transport for travel on dry land and sea, have no “spiritual importance”  for the Georgian man, “neither the steam train, nor the steam ship nor  the telegraph have brought hardly any utility into our spiritual life.” The  Georgian man makes no use of the inventions of the nineteenth century  that annihilate space and time (Schivelbusch 1977, 33), because, frankly,  he doesn’t want to go anywhere and is not interested in understanding  or seeing anything, not only in other countries, but practically in his  own country either.  How do we reconcile this model of travel with what we tend to view as  being the essence of travel? European travel writing is a genre generated  at the margins of self and other, familiar and foreign. Therefore travel  — 260 — </page> <page sequence="11"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— writing requires traversing an imaginative geography and recapitulating  the oppositions that inform such an imaginative geography, along the  way finding them manifested “on the ground” in representative figures  that tend to confirm the basic otherness of the territory traversed in  relation to one’s home. In general:  Travelers, then, impose on the foreign a demand that it  should in some way proclaim itself as different from the  familiar. At the same time, they define their own task as  one of grasping that difference. Travel writings regularly  note the disadvantages of those travelers who, for what- ever reason, are unresponsive to alterity. (Chard 1999, 3)  Georgian travel writings like that of Sano, at least, are willing to do  that last bit, for travel is mostly an opportunity to lambaste oneself,  or other Georgians and Russians, for their unresponsiveness to alter- ity. Thus, it is not as though Georgians were somehow unaware of this  definition of what it meant to travel, or had some competing definition.  As Georgian writers like Sano and Proneli make abundantly clear, Geor- gians know perfectly well what it is, it is just that they don’t want to  do it. The project of Georgian travelers, by and large, does not involve  interest in exploring the foreign, the unfamiliar, or the different. The  Georgian traveler, too, because of the unstable position of Georgia be- tween enlightened Europe and exotic Asia, shows little desire to explore  the indeterminate position of Georgia within this space, the exoticism  of Asia has no allure for him (and in any case any Tbilisian could find  “Asia” in the bazaars of his hometown, as our feuilletonist reminds us  in the preceding chapter), and Europe remains more of a geographical  expression of modernity as such than a concrete destination. These  places largely stand for categories or positions in a space of progres- sive teleology, ways of classifying or criticizing the locality, of finding  fault with “useless” intelligentsia in the locality; they are not places to  actually visit. In a way, too, the local peregrinations of Georgian travel  letters are just an extension of the existing genre of correspondence.  Just as correspondence allows stationary readers of Droeba located in  this or that corner of Georgia to become writers to Droeba, so travelers  are simply correspondents who are now themselves in motion, like the  newspapers they read and the letters of correspondence they send back.  — 261 — </page> <page sequence="12"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— Both are equally circumscribed by locality. Even in places like Ottoman Georgia, the Georgian traveler often  seeks the familiar in the strange landscape. Here and there, Georgian  travelers find the familiar preserved in the form of Christian ruins,  customs, superstitions, even alleged practices of “secret Christian- ity” practiced among the ruins of old Christian churches. Alongside  ethnographic notes on the Georgianness of the inhabitants, the most  extensive descriptions are devoted to the ruins of old churches, usually  attributed to the illustrious empire of Queen Tamar. But in general, Ot- toman Georgia fascinates not because of its Oriental alterity, as it would  European traveler, or even the picturesque assemblage of the ancient  Georgian ruins and the exotic Ottoman present, but because of the ru- ins of Georgianness, both moral and material, that preserve a sense of  familiarity in the landscape. Here, in the erstwhile center of Georgia’s  past glory, ruins of Georgia’s past are common, perhaps more common  than in Georgia itself: “in the district of Ardahan, wherever a person  goes, they encounter old remains at every step: ruined churches and  castles.”23 Accordingly, the traveler to Ottoman Georgia travels in time,  not in space, and the most typical kind of correspondence is ultimately  the genre of “archaeological travel.”  Georgian travelers define themselves not so much as travelers in  space, as in time. This emerges most clearly if we compare the two most  distant places that Georgians traveled to in the 1870s: Ottoman Georgia  and Europe. Georgians who traveled to Ottoman Georgia were above all  archaeological travelers, travelers seeking an image of a lost Georgian  empire under Queen Tamar: their landmarks are the ruins of Georgian  churches, which, more than anything else, attract attention and give  license for their travels and were textualized as a kind of monumental  palimpsest. At the same time, it might be said that travel to Europe was  travel to the future; there, in Europe, one went to witness the destina- tion of a progressive civilizational teleology, to see world exhibitions  and find models for progressive reform of Georgia, and most of all, to  read newspapers.  Traveling to the Past: The Archaeological Traveler Bavreli, taking his leave after dinner with some local Tatar inhabitants  in Ardahan, extracts from the locals a strange promise: — 262 — </page> <page sequence="13"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— We took our leave. My last request was that, whatever  old relics [nashti] there were: fortresses, churches and  halls, that they not destroy them. They gave me their  promise. I left. He then lectures the reader on the moral significance of these mate- rial ruins: It will not be unseemly, for those who have possession  of [these ruins] to pay attention and issue commands  to others, that these remains [nashtebi] which have re- mained from the old life, that they will not ruin and de- stroy them even more. Maybe our future [generations]  won’t be as cold-hearted as we are; maybe these ruins,  witnesses of our past life, will have influence on them  and they will become sign posts showing them the way  for another life. . . .24 Bavreli’s peculiar request needs to be understood within a broader  episteme arising in the 1870s, a period in which the “archaeological  journey” becomes a special subgenre within the broader genre of travel  letters, a subgenre especially associated with Ottoman Georgia. By the  1870s, Georgian Romantics had made ancient churches into secular  objects that were already becoming hybrids of the Romantic discourse  of ruins (eliciting a subjective lyric response) and a newer archaeological  discourse that treats churches as historical national monuments (eliciting  a historical, memorial response) (see Manning 2008). As monuments,  these old Georgian churches stood in opposition to the new Russian  ones as icons of differences in monumental time, in which the tempo- rality of Georgian orthodoxy and Georgian empire encompasses that of  Russian Orthodoxy and Russian Empire by an order of aeons. Vaxtang  Orbeliani’s (1812–1890) poem, “Two Buildings,” from the same period  (1881) contrasts a contemporary (Russian) freshly painted building to  an old Georgian one from the period of Tamar, which is encrusted with  weeds. The first building has weak walls which are easily destroyed, and  even its ruins will quickly disappear into the earth: “it has no past, nor  will it have a future.” The second one, including a “holy church,” while  — 263 — </page> <page sequence="14"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— abandoned and overgrown with weeds, has no fear of the flow of time,  “it stands heroically, built by the hands of heroes,” and “if someday its  walls are destroyed, its remnants (shtenni) will remain forever,” “because  a great past has a great future.” If the Russian “imperial sublime” (Ram  and Shatirishvili 2004) emphasizes the spatial vastness of empire, pro- jected both on vertical and horizontal spatial axes, by which the Russian  Empire both encompasses and surveys from a great height colonies like  Georgia, the Georgian imperial sublime instead is projected onto the  canvas of time, encompassing the Russian Empire on a temporal order  of aeons. In late Romantic poems, we already see signs that old churches are  moving from the aesthetic order of ruins to the epistemic order of  monuments, from the subjective lyricism of Romantic poetry to the dis- passionate disciplinary empiricism of Georgian archaeology, from the  period of “romanticism” to the period of “realism” (Lotman 1984, 142).  Romantic ruins are mysterious, illegible, hieroglyphic; archaeological  positivism would replace this mystery with historical knowledge as  surely as it would remove the moss from the facade to read the inscrip- tions beneath (Edwards 1999, 16). The new archaeological understand- ing assimilated old churches to the category of monuments (dzegli),  which included verbal texts (including both written monuments like  Rustaveli’s poem Vepxistqaosani as well as oral texts passed from mouth  to mouth) as well as other secular buildings like fortresses, all of which  were felt to be traces (k’vali), remnants (nashti), signs (nishani) of a once  great Georgian civilization, to be monuments and witnesses of the  culture of a Georgian nation.25 Each kind of monument (architectural,  textual, customary, oral) would become the object of a corresponding  emergent academic discipline (archaeology, philology, ethnography, and  folklore), both within imperial academies as well at the amateur level  in the Georgian popular press. Each emerging discipline (archaeology,  ethnography, folklore, philology) constituted itself with respect to a  specific sort of empirical object but were understood to be homologous  in methodology and aim (compare van der Veer 2001, chapter 5). The  work of archaeology in piecing together the scattered ruins of the nation  (associated with rulers like Tamar, to whom in the popular tradition in  Russian and Ottoman Georgia these monuments were usually ascribed)  were likened to the philological work of reconstructing from various  existing manuscripts a singular, authoritative Ur-text of the national  — 264 — </page> <page sequence="15"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— epic poem (associated with a contemporary of Queen Tamar, the poet  Shota Rustaveli). All these new disciplines were also united in having  a single transcendent object; they were all disciplines of “the nation,”  each revealed a specific kind of national specificity. Accordingly, each  disciplinary object, each “monument,” could be assigned, once and for  all, on the basis of original authorship, to exactly one such transcendent  historical national unity. These changes in the epistemic order occurred around the same time  as the Russian conquest of territories of Ottoman Georgia in 1877–8.  These territories had formed the center of Tamar’s empire in the twelfth  century, but had been under Ottoman rule for over two centuries. As  we have seen, Ottoman Georgia had become the site of a major cur- rent of irredentist fantasy of the cultural and political reunification of  these “long separated brothers,” Ottoman and Russian Georgia. In the  period leading up to the war, and in the immediate aftermath, Russian  imperial spies and archaeologists (all of them Georgians) and Georgian  newspaper correspondents, respectively, scoured the countryside of Ot- toman Georgia, finding little that was Georgian there other than ruins  of churches. Even if the people often no longer resembled Georgians in  language and especially religion, the ruined churches that dotted the  landscape were signs that the land itself, if not the people, belonged to  Georgians.  With the “archaeologization” of churches, the interpretive custody  of old churches passed by slow degrees from Orthodoxy to the nation,  from religious sites of worship of God to secular monuments of the na- tion. Georgian travelers in Ottoman Georgia like Qazbegi and Bavreli  continually drew attention to the nature and quality of ruins, particu- larly of churches, always searching for telltale inscriptions that would  permit identifying them as “Georgian,” but rarely tarrying as their  forebears might have done to emit a lyric groan or melancholy sigh.  Since local Georgians were usually Muslims (hence Bavreli calls them  “Tatars” above), these churches had ceased to be Georgian religious  objects and were now freely appropriable as secular objects belonging  to the Georgian nation. Georgian travelers like Bavreli worried that the  local Muslim population would destroy these ruins to use the old stones  for building purposes and requested that they not do so. But as the Ot- toman Georgian Tatars fled these conquered lands, Georgian writers  worried that the emptied-out landscape was filling up with Armenians,  — 265 — </page> <page sequence="16"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— and they were even more scandalized that some such churches were be- ing appropriated by the local Christian populace as Armenian apostolic  churches, often accusing the local Armenian population of intentionally  hiding or defacing Georgian inscriptions (e.g., Bakradze 1987 [1878],  41).26 Accordingly, every church was scoured for signs of Georgian  inscriptions that would establish once and for all that a given church  was part of the Georgian, and not Armenian, religious, and therefore  national, patrimony. In this discourse, the appropriation of ruins of churches was strongly  textualized, ruins were seldom illustrated as parts of sublime landscapes  but were more often transcribed as textual objects. Bakradze’s Archaeo- logical Journey to Guria and Ajaria (published in Russian in 1878, de- scribing a journey to Ottoman Georgia that took place in 1873), shows  a strongly textualizing approach to monuments. The only illustrations  of churches in his book are a paltry few drawn by Giorgi Qazbegi (1839– 1921) during an earlier espionage mission in Ottoman lands (published  in 1875), while his own illustrations, numbering over a hundred, are all  transcriptions or illustrations of inscriptions found on these churches.  This “textualizing” shift is registered even in late Romantic poetry from  the period. Vaxtang Orbeliani’s poem “There Is a Place” (Aris Adgili . . . ;  Orbeliani 1879) about Gelati Monastery, the burial place of Tamar, be- gins with a description that otherwise shows all the typical affect-laden  qualities of the Romantic ruin, the sublime and deserted surrounding  landscape, the moonlight, and especially “the moss of a thousand years”  that decorates it. However, the ruin is first of all a monumental text: “Its  walls . . . are a notebook” (amis k’edeli . . . aris rveuli), that tell the tales of  thousands of years, of its glorious builders, specifically, of Tamar.  Just as the architectural landscape is read as monumental text,  textual monuments are read into the landscape. Travelers to Ottoman  Georgia make the strange Ottoman Georgian landscape familiar by see- ing in it illustrations of passages from the epic poem by Rustaveli. As we  saw above, one traveler thinks to see in the Ottoman Georgian city of  Batumi a fabled city from Rustaveli’s poem;27 while Bavreli, daydreaming  on a boat floating down the Choroxi River in Ottoman Georgia, thinks  himself to be “in the land described by Rustaveli.”28 The two kinds of  monuments, ruins, and texts move from metaphoric to metonymic par- allelism: Ottoman Georgian churches are themselves searched for signs  of texts, inscriptions, and old books in Georgian. At the same time, parts  — 266 — </page> <page sequence="17"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— of the Ottoman Georgian landscape are searched for scenic spots that  Rustaveli had in mind when writing his epic poem. The ruins authored  by Queen Tamar and the epic poem authored by Rustaveli become two  series of monuments, architectural and literary, that, taken in tandem,  allow the imagining of Georgia, an ancient Georgia whose center was  Ottoman Georgia.  To further reinforce this metonymic alignment of the archaeological  and philological orders of monuments, the first deluxe illustrated print  edition of Rustaveli’s epic poem (1888) made this connection explicit  by having the decorative borders and capitals of this textual monument  be drawn from the decorative reliefs found in old churches. As the in- troduction to the edition itself notes, “Almost every monastery and  fortress,—Mcxeta, Uplis-cixe, Betania, Kutaisi, Gelati, Sapara, Kabeni,  Axtali, Pitareti, Samtavisi, Ateni—has its part [c’ili], has imprinted its  mark [k’vali], in this book” (Kartvelishvili 1888, 325). On this simple,  decorative level, this text stands as a kind of print microcosm of the  national macrocosm. Here the monumental text contains within it  parts (c’ili) and marks or traces (k’vali) of the order of architectural  monuments which mark the historical territory of Georgia, thus link- ing together the order of circulatory textual monuments (the first print  edition of the poem) with the immovable order of archeological monu- ments as an intertextual series. The assimilation of churches to the quasi-textual order of the  “monument” was also a decisive move to transform them into objects  of a secular intelligentsia discourse. On the eve of conquest, the intel- ligentsia project for Ottoman Georgia was an explicitly secular one,  which emphasized only putative commonalities (a common culture and  language) between Russian Georgians and Ottoman Georgians, ignor- ing or downplaying the religious divide between them as Christians and  Muslims. This approach was in explicit opposition to state-sponsored  programs of proselytism as represented by the Society for the Resto- ration of Orthodoxy (see above).29 The assimilation of churches to the  authorship of the monarch Tamar alongside the secular epic poem by  her contemporary Rustaveli represented, in effect, a claim by the secular  Georgian intelligentsia for authority over these monuments and their  interpretation. As time goes on, such intelligentsia discourses about  churches as monuments of culture become ever more explicitly critical  of the Russian Orthodox Church.  — 267 — </page> <page sequence="18"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— Lastly, the fact that these old churches were ruined temples in distant  lands deserted by Georgians made visits to them into pilgrimages as well  as expeditions. Starting with the travelers of the 1870s, “archaeological  excursions” and “archaeological descriptions” have become a distinct  genre within the broader category of travel letters, and by the 1890s,  churches had become exemplary subjects for the nascent social practice  of amateur photography. While “archaeological excursions” have a solid  non-Romantic epistemic alibi, the fact that the ruins surveyed were  always Georgian ones showed that the aesthetic discourse of the Geor- gian imperial sublime was always a factor. One Georgian travel writer  and amateur photographer (Alxanishvili, whom we met above), sum- marizing his own motives for traveling to Ottoman Georgia, pointed to  precisely this sense of the sublime one could only feel there, in Ottoman  Georgia, the erstwhile center of a large Georgian empire:  The reason for our travel was to inspect and photograph,  along with inscriptions, old remains [nashtebi], signs  [nishnebi] of a strong and lively life of Georgia that once  existed here. Lo, he who wishes to feel the strength of  the Georgians in the past must travel to these places.30   What a Georgian intelligent might experience in these places of  secular pilgrimage is a kind of Georgian “imperial sublime,” a melan- choly sublime mingled with the picturesque, in which one surveys the  strength and life of a quondam Georgian empire fallen into ruin and  decay. In Artvin, Bavreli has met up with some young Georgians who  have bought wine and they go into the ruins of Artvin’s ruined fortress,  which stands on the cliffs overlooking the Choroxi, to drink it. Here they  find the ruins of a complex technology of wine storage (a series of inter- linked wine jars [kvevri]), which attests that “once Georgians lived here.”  Appropriately, here they spread their tablecloth [supra] and drink their  wine. One of his “chirruping” companions offered the following toast in  the register of this “imperial sublime”: Brothers, let us drink to the memory of those brave he- roes, of our ancestors, who once apparently lived here  and battled for the freedom of their families before  violent and barbaric enemies! May God will that their  — 268 — </page> <page sequence="19"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— good feeling be passed on to us! May God will it! Cheers,  Cheers! He offers that the “chirrup” of his companions will not be pleasant  for every ear, “but fortunately, no one was listening other than the  sheer cliffs, and only they joined in our song.”31 Toasting the ancestors  among the ruins, with only sheer cliffs to listen and answer, produces  the sublime and melancholy sense of loneliness and loss of past glories  that characterizes the Georgian “imperial sublime.” (I owe the idea of a  specifically Georgian “imperial sublime” to Zaza Shatirishvili.) Perhaps the most striking difference between travel letters about  Ottoman Georgia in the 1870s and the explosion of ethnographic writ- ings about the mountains of Georgia in the 1880s is the way that the  material aspects of the landscape, in particular ruins, dominate over the  moral characteristics of the contemporary inhabitants in the former,  and not the latter. It might be added that the material ruin stood as a  handy figure for the moral condition of Georgianness among the Otto- man Georgians, whose Georgianness was much like a ruined building,  able to be deciphered in shards and fragments of language and custom  and perhaps even practices of “secret Christianity,” but nowhere found  in its original, integral form. One commentator from Ottoman Geor- gia in 1882, complaining about the general disinterest of Georgians in  “their brothers” and distorted picture presented in the press about the  moral condition of the people, treating them just as if they were like any  other tribe of Georgians, advised that, in reality, only in their external  appearance and among the monuments of language, specifically oral  texts, could the Georgianness of the people be clearly descried, “—all  the rest, which constitutes the specific characteristics of Georgians and  by which they are differentiated from other neighboring peoples has  been smashed to smithereens . . .”32 But if the order of material ruins  stood as a metaphor for the moral ruins of Georgianness of the Geor- gians living on these ruins, there was also, as Bavreli suggests above,  an indexical, metonymic effect: perhaps these material ruins, associated  in the popular memory with the figure of Queen Tamar, could act as a  form of the Georgian “imperial sublime,” act to instill memory of Geor- gianness, of a lost Georgian empire associated with the name of Queen  Tamar, among the people. Alongside this secular “imperial sublime,” in  which Georgians experience their past glories by pilgrimage to the ruins  — 269 — </page> <page sequence="20"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— of Ottoman Georgia, Georgian intellectuals imputed other ennobling  moral effects of material ruins on the Ottomans themselves.  Alongside the way that these ruins served as a secular reminder for  the Ottomans of their Georgianness, their prior belonging in a large  Georgian empire, there was also frequently imputed to the Ottoman  Georgians practices (based, it appears, on local Muslim folklore or ru- mor) of “secret Christianity” revolving around these abandoned ruins in  the woods.33 For the most part, the local accounts place these practices  in the past, part of a narrative of conversion, while the Georgian ac- counts move them into the present tense. For example, Bavreli quotes  one Georgian Muslim interlocutor as reporting of his own people that  they used to practice secret Christianity: We used to be Georgians [Kartvelebi, presumably in the  sense of ‘Christians’], I learned this from my grandmoth- er. That dearly-departed one knew Georgian, and read  and wrote it like water. God, who seeks out his qulebs  (monebs [‘servants’]), undoubtedly looking down upon  them from above, our grandparents saw, that Islam was  the true faith and accepted it, but among them many  Georgians [Kartvelebi] remained, and secretly retained  their old faith.—They say that by night they would go  into the woods and there they would pray in the church.  They say that the remains [nashti] of that church are  even now in the woods. Our people learned this and  caught them all at once.34  In a sense, imputing to Georgian Muslims practices of “secret Chris- tianity” points to a similar “return of the repressed” in their own secular  interpretation of monuments: by these means the Georgian intelligentsia  can construct the population and the ruins simultaneously as belonging  overtly to a secular Georgian order (nationality without religion), and si- multaneously give both the monuments and the people a covert religious  (Christian) dimension which again links religion to nationality. The moral effects of Christian monuments on other set of Muslim  Georgians (the Ingilos, living in contemporary Azerbaijan) is also the  theme of a set of fictional travel notes written by Droeba correspondent  Mose ‘Ingilo’ Janashvili. These fictional travel notes present themselves  — 270 — </page> <page sequence="21"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— as a survey of the Georgian ruins of this erstwhile part of Georgia  (Saingilo) by a group of fictional Georgian travelers (fictional because,  as Janashvili points out, other than himself, no other Georgian has ever  traveled there).  Like many real Georgian travelers in Ottoman Geor- gia on which he is modeled, one of these travelers narrates the sort of  “imperial sublime” that the ruins would provoke in any Georgian (if,  presumably, any Georgians ever decided to actually go there):35 ‘Lo, those remains [nashti],’ [one of the travelers said]  said, pointing to the ancient ruins of a temple, ‘surely  can awaken in the heart of a Georgian man warm love  towards the glorious ancestors and at the same time  venom towards their many enemies . . .’ ‘Here,’ he con- tinued, ‘at one time was a great city, named Qumi. We  are convinced of this not only by the traditions passed  done word of mouth by the tongues of the people, but  also by our [historical chronicle] “The Life of Kartli” . . . In  the laps of these lovely mountains apparently once life  bloomed.’36 While the primary purpose of this set of travel letters is to describe  the ruins of this sublime landscape from the imaginary perspective of a  group of Georgian travelers, Ingilo also has his narrator comment on the  parallel moral effects of these same material ruins on the “Lekified” (Lek  is the general east Georgian ethnonym for a wide range of Daghestanian  Muslim mountain groups) people of the village of Belokani: One thing makes us happy, this traveler went on, that  all these Lekified people have a great love towards our  ancestors. This love has apparently remained in them  with the help of all these manifold beautiful remnants  [nashtebi], which here before our eyes smile at us now. All  the local villages and forests are full of such remnants.  For example, Belokanians have before their eyes diverse  churches, the traces [k’vali] of the ruined dwellings of  Georgians and so on. You cannot imagine with what  delight and love they recall our queen Tamar, a woman  whose like never yet been born nor will be.37 — 271 — </page> <page sequence="22"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— The abandoned churches in the woods, the churches, along with  other material signs of Georgianness like fruit trees and grapevines  gone wild,38 serve not only as historical evidence of the Georgianness of  the people for the archaeological traveler, but also, more importantly, a  reminder for the people themselves.  Travels to Europe: The Occidentalist Georgian Traveler Unlike a Russian traveler, who, though uncertain of their Europeanness  among Europeans, still can confidently project themselves as a Euro- pean traveler in Asia, Georgians cannot safely assume a European point  of departure as the “familiar” to contrast with the obvious “foreignness”  of the East. As Sano implied, European travelers are “real travelers,”  and Georgians are not travelers nor, it seems, Europeans. An Oriental- ist Georgian traveler like G. Qazbegi is certain of the validity of a basic  cosmological divide between Europe and Asia and can assign everything  exhaustively a place within this imaginative geography, except himself.  Indeed, throughout his description of Ottoman Georgia, the implied  interlocutor is a European science which knows nothing about and has  never seen these lands (and still has not, since Qazbegi does not identify  himself as a European) (e.g., Qazbegi 1995[1875], 29, 70, 100, 134).39  Perhaps this insecurity of position within the master dichotomy that  organizes most nineteenth-century imaginative geographies (Oriental- ism) leads Georgian travel writers and travelers to beg the question,  or even avoid the question, of where they stand in it. Georgian travel  writing of this period (before the Russian revolution), when it travels  abroad (which is rarely), does not head east or south (since for the Rus- sian empire, Asia is as much south as it is east). It heads north (to the  imperial metropole) and west (to Paris), and then rarely.  European travelers, safe in their knowledge of self, can afford to revel  in the alterity of the Oriental other. Travel in the Orient defines the  European as European, but the historical mission of the Georgian intel- ligentsia is predicated on a nonidentity between Georgians and Euro- peans. After all, the defining mission of the Georgian intelligentsia was  to mediate between Georgia and Europe, to bring Georgia into Europe: Among us the mission of the Georgian intelligentsia  — 272 — </page> <page sequence="23"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— after the end of serfdom was—the development of the  diverse national life into European forms.40 The intelligentsia mission is an almost platonic demiurgic one of  transformation, to mediate between the unchanging (because per- fected) forms of European life and the obdurate and diverse materials  of Georgian national life. This is still the master narrative of the Geor- gian intelligentsia, as it has been, virtually without a break, for over  a century. Because the historical role of the intelligentsia is to bring  Georgia into Europe, the first step of this “intelligentsia mission” is to  go to Europe.  The problem is, of course, that Georgians really don’t like to travel,  even to Europe. This is something which Sergi Mesxi (editor of Droeba)  finds even in his own character: at the beginning of his journey to Eu- rope, remonstrating in part with himself, Mesxi chides all would be intel- ligentsia reformers who wish to make pronouncements on progressive  and enlightening reforms in their own society, who have not seen with  their own eyes the model upon which all such reforms must be based,  Europe, but rather make their unpersuasive pronouncements based on  “knowing two cities in Russia and Tbilisi and Kutaisi,” and from their  apartment in Sololaki [a neighborhood in Tbilisi] “preach to Georgians  that they should stop sleeping, put their hands to new tasks and a new  life and adopt the life of Europe, that life, which you yourself have not  seen and not gotten to know?” For Mesxi, the very alterity of Europe (opposed now to Russia and  Georgia both) recommends itself as a source of models for liberal reform.  Unlike traveling in Asia, journeying to Europe one experiences an alter- ity which is also universality, a set of models to be adopted by all. The  life of Europe is the best representative of life in general, and the life of  France is the best representative of life in Europe: I wanted to see that Europe, whose life, that a man might  really assess it, composes the life of the whole world. And  that France, which, for its part, is the best representative  of the life of Europe. I wanted a little, even in passing,  to become acquainted with and catch sight of the life  of those peoples, whom many envy, whose various ar- rangements and rules others imitate. Where would I see  — 273 — </page> <page sequence="24"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— all these things if not in Western Europe, and in its best  corner, France!41 European forms of life stand to Georgian customs as the future to  the past, whereas the role of the intelligentsia is to describe and criti- cally assess Georgian customs, relicts of past life, as to whether they  are “harmful and impoverishing” (and therefore to be eliminated) or  not, the intelligentsia role with respect to Europe is to understand these  European forms with a view to their eventual adoption in Georgia.  If Paris will be the prototypical incarnation of the pinnacle of Euro- peanness, “the best representative of Europe,” his first stop along the  journey is the World Exhibition in Vienna, where he will find his own  progressive Eurocentric cosmology incarnated in a microcosmic display,  from which the whole imaginative geography in which Mesxi is traveling  concretely is quasi-ritually displayed to be taken in, if not at a glance, at  least in the course of a couple of days. Such a “world picture” represent- ed a condensed, almost fairy-tale microcosm version of the imaginary  journey that Mesxi was undertaking: Universal expositions represented this ‘single expanded  world’ in a microcosm, celebrating the products of indus- try and technological progress and displaying the entire  human experience. Other cultures were brought piece- meal to European and American cities and exhibited as  artifacts in pavilions that were themselves summaries of  cultures . . . World’s fairs were idealized platforms where  cultures could be encapsulated visually—through arti- facts and arts. . . . (Celik 1992, 1)  Mesxi is very familiar with the conventions and expectations of such  a spectacle, he is almost a connoisseur. (He has virtually memorized the  arrangement of the earlier French (therefore better) exhibition, for ex- ample, from a newspaper account). Accordingly, Mesxi is disappointed  with the Vienna world exhibition: Every exhibition must be organized so that the view- ing and recognition of the displayed objects is possible  and made easy not only for knowledgeable persons and  — 274 — </page> <page sequence="25"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— experts, but for everyone. Everyone should be able to  see easily, which art has risen to a higher level in which  country and which people are more practiced in which  art. This is the first and foremost condition of every  exhibition and if this cannot be fulfilled, such an exhibi- tion, you must know, cannot bring any benefit to human  arts.42 Mesxi, a confirmed Francophile, compares it unfavorably with the  French exhibition of 1867 (which, again, Mesxi himself did not actually  see). Unlike the Vienna exhibition, in which the different peoples of  the earth had separate exhibitions laid out iconically in terms of their  relative disposition on the globe, in the French exhibition, the circular  building was laid out into galleries with two intersecting principles of  organization, one that gathered together all the arts of a single people,  the other which was by individual sphere of art or science, and the in- dividual peoples were laid out as a progressive narrative within that  sphere, allowing comparison of the relative achievements of different  peoples in the same branch of arts. Compared with the ideal exhibi- tion found in Paris, the Vienna Exhibition is a disaster: this European  representation lacks Europeanness (it is disorderly and chaotic, very  unlike the straight and clean streets that he remarks upon everywhere  as being impressive characteristics of European cities), and therefore,  it also fails as a representation of the world, because you can’t find any- thing specific anywhere, and as a representation of progress, it fails,  because the incoherent representation fails to represent the ordering  of the whole: The Vienna Exhibition, however, is arranged almost  completely unsystematically, incoherently: The Exhibi- tion occupies a very large space, but in this space often  similar things that belong together are displayed in  completely different houses. One part of the machines,  or industrial objects is in one building, the other part is  somewhere else entirely; some of the crafts of one people  are displayed in one place, some somewhere else entirely.  So a man’s brain becomes confused, the catalog cannot  help you at all, you go around all day, look around and  — 275 — </page> <page sequence="26"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— you can’t arrange anything into or see any kind of order.43 Mesxi is not only interested in seeing a general map of human prog- ress, he wants to know where Georgia and the Caucasus are located on  that map. But because the map is so confusingly laid out, it takes him  two days of searching before he finds it, and upon finding it, he is dis- mayed, mostly because it is nothing new. It turns out to be the very  same exhibit that was displayed at the Moscow Polytechnic the year be- fore, and he has nothing to add to what the Droeba correspondent said  about that exhibit a year before (what that was, he does not say), adding  that he will say only two words about the exhibit, and will say that later!  He leaves Vienna disappointed. In letter 7, Mesxi finally lays eyes on the city of his dreams, Paris.  From the outset, Paris itself presents itself as a “fairy-tale” spectacle  like a world exhibition, a sublime vision with its corresponding subjec- tive states of astonishment and pensiveness, except here it is a sublime  spectacle of infinitude, a city that cannot be taken in by the eye, streets  that are infinite, houses that are like towers. The first time a man lays eyes on Paris, the first time he  step on its ground, has a stupefying and pensive effect  on the mind of a man. His eye sees a city too vast for  the eye to encompass, like the city of a fairy-tale, the  endless straight streets, the six and seven storey houses  raised like towers and rising above these houses the even  higher churches, towers and monuments. . . . You feel  that every foot of this city’s earth is watered with blood  shed for the freedom of France. You feel that you are on  that ground, in that city, which is at one and the same  time the head and heart of all France, where political and  social life pulses. . . .44   Meshki’s stupefaction at encountering his own Occidentalist fanta- sized fairy-tale city, the sacred center of Europe, is such that he can only  compare his own Westernizer’s fantasy come true with its correspond- ing antipode within this Orientalist imaginary, a Muslim (whom he  characterizes as “worshippers of Mohammed”) who first completes the  hajj to their holy city. While presenting his journey as an Occidental- — 276 — </page> <page sequence="27"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— ist inversion of an Oriental’s hajj to Mecca, Mesxi does not become a  Westerner, but insists on his nonidentity, presenting himself as “A man  from the East”: I do not know, what would happen to and with what  feelings the worshippers of Mohammed enter their holy  city – Kaba [sic]; but I think, that their feelings must be  very similar to the feelings of a man who has first arrived  from the East in Paris!45 Paris is a fairy tale come to life, but Mesxi wants to correct the exist- ing Georgian fairy tale about Paris, that it is a city whose “contempo- rary” life is typified by its public, social life (“theatres, a myriad ballets,  evenings, concerts . . .”), in much the same way that he argues elsewhere,  Georgian pseudo-intellectuals reduce European progress and enlighten- ment to a matter of Parisian hats and dresses. He summarizes as follows: We all, who are raised on our own kind of books, have  created an obstinate idea, about “contemporary” Paris  and its life. There [mand, i.e., where his readers are, Geor- gia] from every side we hear “Paris is such a city, such a  crazed life exists there, so many entertaining, diverting,  and attractive things are found there, that not only is  study impossible there, but a restful life and generally  thoughtful work too.”46 “This is a mistaken and false idea from beginning to end,” Mesxi tells  us; there are plenty of things to do in Paris, like any city, he adds, but  also here as elsewhere there are many serious people who want to work  or study, especially since all forms of entertainment turn out to be quite  expensive, while living the life of the mind in Paris turns out to be very  cheap. But for Mesxi, the life of Paris that attracts him is not the social  life of popular entertainments, for he is an intelligent; for him the only  life is the political life, the Paris he wants is the revolutionary Paris. For  Mesxi, the editor of Droeba, the political life of a country to be assessed  by looking at its newspapers, and here Mesxi is certain that “Paris” (and  not Germany) is the answer to the question, “Which has the first place  in the description of the political life of the people?”47  — 277 — </page> <page sequence="28"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— Leaving Paris behind, a city which is, even now, the motherland  of freedom and the newspaper for Mesxi, he is saddened, comparing  himself to a bride oppressed by her mother-in-law, who has had a brief  respite of relative freedom as a guest, and now has been recalled back  into servitude. He recalls that he began his journey with the consolation  that in travel, at least, he can leave behind all those “persons, affairs,  and interests which always fill my heart, which always remind me of my  shortcomings and ‘our’ difficult circumstances.” In short, in particular,  it becomes clear that the main benefit of leaving Tbilisi is to escape other  Tbilisians, “at least I will rest and I will no longer see various people and  events such as have a deadening effect on me,” he thinks.48  But alas, other Tbilisians can travel too, and he dedicates his eighth  and final letter (like Chavchavadze's travel letters, Mesxi's journey is  divided into eight stages) to discussing the problem of going to Europe  and finding other Tbilisians there. In Poti, as he is taking his seat on the  boat that will take him across the Black Sea to Europe, he runs into an  acquaintance from Tbilisi (whom he will later call Polkovnik), who, after  exchanging greetings, takes a seat next to him and begins to ask Mesxi  about his itinerary. The deadening prospect of having a boorish fellow  countryman as his constant companion raises its ugly head: —Where are you headed? —To Vienna. —To the exhibition? —To the exhibition. —Very good, I am going there too. From there do you  intend to go somewhere? —To Paris.  —Even better: I’m also going to Paris. Then we are  fellow travelers. It’s very nice to have a fellow traveler on  the road!49 Mesxi realizes he is in for a long voyage as his new travel companion  “twitters away a whole hour with incessant chatter,” so he takes out a  book and slowly begins leafing through it, and somehow signals with  a glance to his chattersome travel companion that he is no longer pay- ing attention to his chatter and wishes to be left alone. His companion  somehow gets the message, stands up, and seats himself with some other  — 278 — </page> <page sequence="29"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— acquaintances, and other than brief greetings, they remain separate for  the remainder of the voyage. In Odessa, Mesxi sneaks off the boat, hop- ing never to run into this friend again. The plan is a success, he makes  it alone to Vienna, and thence to Paris. In Paris, however, his luck runs  out: one evening while he is out walking and window-shopping with  a French student along the Boulevard des Italiens, he hears a familiar  voice greet him in Russian. There is no help for it, he must obey his fate;  he exchanges cards with his traveling companion from Poti, Polkovnik,  and they meet up once or twice for meals.  This Polkovnik appears to be a dreadful boor. In restaurants, he takes  it amiss whenever the garcon serves anyone else seated in the restau- rant, “some simple merchant or who knows, even a clerk!” ahead of him,  stewing in anger through the meal, “only from time to time looking over  at the garcon wrathfully, as if to he wished to instill fear and trembling  in his heart with his blazing glare.”50 After an imagined slight having to  do with the dessert tray, Polkovnik rages, “What can a man do? Here is  their égalité! Wherever you step, everyone has written on their face lib- erté, égalite, fraternité! Here is their liberty, unity [sic] and brotherhood,  that they don’t know how to pay respects to their betters and they lack  manners!”51 In short, Polkovnik understands very well how service in a French  restaurant enacts in everyday life the revolutionary principles of liberté,  égalité, fraternité, it’s just that he is allergic to these things. He requires  a more aristocratic standard of service. After reporting another horror  story of égalité at another restaurant, where the two servers have the  temerity, after they are done serving the guests, to sit themselves down  at their side the very same host’s table and begin eating, Polkovnik de- scribes his attempts to instruct them in manners by yelling “Garcon!”  every time they sit down, but his attempts to instruct French waiters in  the fundamentally aristocratic etymology of service are in vain, and he  decides he must leave this intolerable country.52 And true to his word, he  does leave Paris, spending three days in London, upon returning coun- sels Mesxi to return home to our “blessed land.” Thus, after spending  three days in Vienna, a week in Paris, and three days in London, “now,  when he returns home, without a doubt, he will say ‘I traveled Europe.  The people of France are in decline, Germany is 10 times more advanced  in every respect, England is a wealthy country,’ etc. etc.”53 — 279 — </page> <page sequence="30"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— Ardanuji by Moonlight: The Orientalist Georgian Traveler If intelligentsia like Mesxi travel to Europe to see the future Western  world they dream for Georgia, to travel to Ottoman Georgia is, in terms  of imaginative geography, to travel in the opposite direction, or rather  two opposed directions: to the exotic East (despite the fact that they are  literally moving to the southwest); but also, as we have seen above, into  the Georgian past. The land of Ottoman Georgia has once been, and is  now again, Georgian, and yet, like the babble of the Choroxi, it and its  people have become strange, Oriental, and even the familiar Mtkvari  changes its tone in Ottoman lands: “If no one were to tell you that this is  the Mktkvari, you wouldn’t know you were looking at the Mtkvari. That  noisiness, that haughtiness, that strength, here changes into peaceful- ness.” Accordingly, Bavreli’s descriptions seem torn between localism,  his desire to see a familiar fragment of Georgia in the contemporary land  and its people, and not merely content himself with the Georgian ruins  that dot the land, and a desire to give himself over to the exoticizing  Orientalism of a European traveler. Sometimes, in the wooden houses  and green fields of an Ottoman village, he thinks to see a fragment of  Imereti:  “the villages around here, their buildings and the nature, too,  is almost Imereti.54 At other times, he poetically adorns the features of  nature with Asiatic dress: “the darkness of night hid the local area under  its curtain, as a chador unfairly hides a beautiful Tatar woman.”55 “The  sun crossed over towards the mountains. In the light of the sun’s rays  the blue peaks of the mountains were painted pleasingly with a chador  of snow.”56  In this strange yet familiar landscape, Bavreli frequently divides the  landscape into elements of two discrete temporal series, the Georgian  past, figured usually as a ruined church, and the Ottoman present,  which is figured variously in the landscape, the contemporary build- ings, or the people. This produces a picturesque contrast, in which  Christian ruins and Oriental gardens are equally important scenic ele- ments which compose a picturesque assemblage: From afar Grtvani appears as a beautiful city, decorated  with gardens. Olive groves further beautify the city. . .  . It was in the evening at the time of prayer. A Tatar in  a white chalma had gone up onto a great cliff and was  — 280 — </page> <page sequence="31"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— offering a prayer to Allah . . . The houses of the village [of  Lomasheni] are almost entirely hidden from view by the  olive gardens. It has a pretty location. One side looks out  over the Choroxi river, on the other side are high cliffs.  Above Lomasheni (one verst away) there stands an old  church.57  The two are ordered as a temporal opposition within the picturesque  whole, as the order of ruins belongs to the melancholy lost world of  Christian Georgia, while the gardens and olive groves, the praying Mus- lim to the Ottoman present.  At the same time, Bavreli is at times a strictly picturesque traveler,  seeking after spots whose contrasts are important not because they il- lustrate the contrasts of an Orientalist imaginative geography but only  because they give rise to picturesque aesthetics. The neighborhood of  Artvin seems to abound in such picturesque spots: Up to this point you have seen the Choroxi from afar,  here, now we come close. Hither and there are little is- lands, narrow places, where red sand, collosal boulders  appear. At one point the Choroxi has so narrowed the  road by the cliff, that if a traveler doesn’t dismount, he  cannot pass. . . . Another picturesque [samxatvro] spot is  the end of Artvin’s bridge—on one side high mountains,  olive gardens below, on the other side an old fortress  on sheer cliffs. In the narrows between two cliffs sits  a place like a little hamlet, with pretty shops. Above a  rainbow-shaped bridge over the Choroxi. The Choroxi  by the bridge is slow and deep. Below the bridge stand  a thousand different kinds of qaighi (navebi [‘boats’])  and some of the Ajarians are hauling cattle in the boats  quickly, some are unloading cattle from the boats.58 Elsewhere, albeit rarely, Bavreli moves decisively from the flattened  affect and deadened nature of realism to a more Romantic Orientalist  description that invests the landscape with expressive and fantastic  elements. If in his descriptions of Lomasheni and Artvin Bavreli gives  reign to his feeling for the Orientalist picturesque, at Ardanuji he gives  — 281 — </page> <page sequence="32"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— full flight to his fancy, making the city into a locus of the Orientalist  fantastic: We came into Ardanuji. The remains of an old church on  a high cliff, an equally old wall of mortared stone, which  surrounds this small city, encircled by high harsh cliffs  and bald mountains, gives Ardanuji a sort of fantastic  appearance.59 Finally, we meet up with Bavreli in the town where we first found  him, dreaming up the news in the town of Ardanuji, a town which in  a slightly earlier letter represented for him an empty desolate exile,  almost an afterlife, from the circulatory universe of Tbilisi. Before, Ar- danuji was situated in an Orient whose primary features distinguishing  it from European Tbilisi was the absolute stasis and absence of circu- lation and life. Now Ardanuji instead comes to represent an positively  valued fantastic land in which Bavreli can freely invest the landscape and  people with all those expressive elements that he would not be able to  if he were in Imereti in “European” Georgia, whose life and problems  require a more prosaic realism. Ardanuji is, after all, part of a strange  dreamlike land from the fantastic medieval stories of Rustaveli.60 It is in  a “New Land (Seen in Dreams and Awake)” (the title, after all, of his long  feuilleton taking place in Ardanuji); a land caught between empiricism  and imagination, waking life and dreams. It is in the Orient.  “This little city,” Ardanuji, standing a day and a half west of Ardahan,  “used to be ours, and even now it has become ours once again. If it is  ours, we should know what kind of city it is. Here I will describe it for  you.”61 His description dwells lovingly on the pretty streets, the wood  and stone houses so close together that “you would think they are all  descended from one mother and thus they have a great love for one  another,” and then moves on to the ruins, the cliffs, the surrounding na- ture.62 Having set off this “pretty little city” in description, after a brief  prologue in which he extols the beauty of autumnal moonlit nights in  Georgia, he invites the reader to imagine the equal or greater beauty of  such a night in Ardanuji, he moves from simple description to rapture: Who has not seen somewhere in Georgia beautiful  moonlit Autumnal nights and has not been given over  — 282 — </page> <page sequence="33"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— then to daydreams? . . . Ardanuji has one of the most  beautiful of these beautiful nights. Jupiter has not given  to me a place in his Parnassus, I am not gifted by the  heavens above with a fountain of rhythms pleasing to  the ear, that I might have sung with verse my love for  nights around here, which leads a slave of a weak nature  like me into amazement.63 Bavreli ends his description of the landscape of Ardanuji with a por- trait of the city by moonlight, as the city has moved from culture to  nature, the noisy din of humanity changed to a still image of a landscape  without the bustle of humanity.  Behold it has become dark. Twilight has spread its shad- owy sheet. All of the inhabitants of this small city have  sought out their own homes. Silence! That noisiness,  that great bustle, the rumble of carriages, the ringing  laughter in the circle of women – conversation, the se- ductive whispers of delicate educated women – is not  present here! Here nature reigns! I am sitting, like a bird who has fallen into a foreign  land and from an open window I delight in the beauty of  nature. Behold the full moon has risen too and dresses  nature with a light like that of its brother. Then you  will think that the stars too have begun to flicker and  whisper. . . .64 From his window perch, he takes in his surroundings with rapt  wonderment. His description takes in the way the moon lights up the  snowy peaks of far mountains of Iasamani to the east, the high and  steep cliffs of mount Kuardeba to the right, to the west the peaks of  Varishxeti. He moves from mountains to nearby places, to fires appear- ing like earth-born stars in a little village nearby, “wrapped in fresh air,”  the high cliffs of Qomrali, which looks out directly across to another  cliff: “They look at each other with some sort of secret sorrow.” Finally,  his gaze returns to the city itself by moonlight, and he finishes this  rapturous description so: — 283 — </page> <page sequence="34"> —————————————————— CHAPTER EIGHT —————————————————— Lo, the city itself. The river’s reproachful muttering can  be heard. From time to time the barking of dogs destroys  the silence, to the right appear the ruins of an old tower;  hither white houses, from whose windows can be seen  laughing Tatar women; secluded by day, by night they  enjoy fearless freedom. Lo, a mullah has gone up onto the minaret and  gives the call to prayer. Oh, what a pleasing voice it is!  Every rise and fall of his voice, stanzas strung together  like pearls strikes a man’s heart strings and makes him  tremble. In that voice is expressed national sentiment  [nacionaluri grdznoba]. Only Orientals can feel it. This  will not please the good taste of a European. . . .65 In this final description, Bavreli gives full reign to a firmly senti- mental, Orientalist description of Ardanuji. Here there is no attempt  to use ruins as a key to decode the past; ruins are ruins, by moonlight,  alongside the minaret, both are equally picturesque. Bavreli, always an  ambivalent interlocutor, very unlike the later travelers, in his rapture  moves into awe and wonder, typically European aesthetic responses to  the Orient. But at the same time, in a move that is extremely rare for  Georgians, he elides his own lyric subject position subtly into that of  the Oriental: his enjoyment of the voice of the mullah’s call to prayer, in  which is portrayed “national sentiment” [nacionaluri grdznoba], moves  him. Since it expresses “national sentiment” and therefore can only  move Orientals, it will not appeal to European canons of taste, there- fore, Bavreli, perched on his window in a moonlit night in Ardanuji, sug- gests perhaps that he himself has become, or always was, an Oriental.  In some sense, this is always a position available to Georgians, who am- bivalently position themselves with respect to Ottomans as Europeans  and yet simultaneously oppose themselves to “real” European travelers  (compare G. Qazbegi, Sano, above). But even if Georgians, then as now,  treat Europe as a “shifter” in which they are now included, now excluded  (on Europe as a “shifter” see Gal 1991), nevertheless, Georgians of that  time, as well as now, are not similarly willing to accept the converse, that  they themselves may be in some sense, in some contexts, Orientals.  This is what makes this Orientalizing moment so peculiar. His apper- ception of space as a Georgian, a shifting position as a traveler, himself  — 284 — </page> <page sequence="35"> ————————— Fellow Travelers: Localism, Occidentalism, and Orientalism ————————— an Oriental, traveling in the Orient, moves briefly from ambivalence to  full identification with the Orient. And Ardanuji, a town that a moment  earlier his correspondence is defined a desolate no-man’s-land beyond  the pale of Occidentalist circulatory civilization, is now transformed into  an aestheticized Orientalist fantasy. Bavreli is similarly ambivalent, now  seeing in Ardanuji a lifeless desolate place of exile from the European  world of circulation, now seeing in it a place in whose autumnal moonlit  nights he can lose himself momentarily in the “national sentiments” in- scrutable to Europeans and pleasing only to the Oriental soul. We might  ask the question, then: Who was Bavreli, a man who we know to be from  a town on the borderlands of European and Ottoman Georgia? — 285 — </page> </plain_text>
