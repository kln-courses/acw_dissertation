Settle? ment preferences and recruitment of the bryozoan Bugula neritina on drift macroalgae in Mosquito Lagoon, Florida. In Mosquito Lagoon (the northernmost region of the Indian River Lagoon, Florida), significant differences in the abundance and diversity of drift macroalgae were found when sampled on a monthly basis from Janu? ary 1998 - March 2000. In the winter months, the arborescent bryozoan Bugula neritina was commonly found attached to available drift species in the order Gigartinales, Rhodophycea. However, it was rarely found on these same algal species when they were attached. In replicated single and multiple- choice trials in the laboratory that included the seagrass Halodule wrightii and the macroalgae Hypnea cervicornis, Gracilaria armata, Gracilaria tikvahiae, Enteromorpha compressa, Agardhiella subulata and Dasya rigidula, the two species of red algae Grae//ar/a were significantly preferred in both types of trials. Despite having a similar mor? phology to G. armata, Dasya rigidula was avoided by settling larvae of B. neritina and greater than 60% larval mortality occurred in the bioassays.To determine if the preferred settlement choice of B. neritina is due to the morphology of Gracilaria or secondary chemicals, field trials were run comparing recruitment on attached versus drift G. armata and attached versus drift mimics. Bugula neritina never recruited on attached G. armata and rarely on mimics (drift or at? tached); however, large numbers of larvae recruited on drift G. armata.

For many organisms olfaction plays a key role in communication. Crayfish use olfac? tory signals to find mates, warn of predators, and relay social status. While many of these situations have been studied in detail, be- havior of conspecifics toward molted indi? viduals has not. The physiology of crayfish changes dramatically during molting (ecdysis), which in turn changes both the content and concentrations of the chemical cues released into the water. We hypoth? esized that conspecifics would pick up these changes in chemicals released and move toward the molt signal. A Y-maze was used to test for a differential attraction to various odors presented to intermolt (non-molting) crayfish. All crayfish used were of the spe? cies Orconectes rusticus. The odor sources were molt crayfish, intermolt crayfish, aged tank water (control), or food (fish carrion). Variables measured included initial arm choice, time spent in each arm, walking speed toward source, meral spread, and straightness of path. On average, crayfish spent more time the presence of molt sig? nals when paired with intermolt or control stimuli. The food stimulus was more attrac- tive than over any of the other stimuli. These results demonstrate that there is a difference in the way a conspecific perceives a recently molted individual versus an intermolt indi? vidual. Since cannabalism and aggressive- ness toward molted individuals has been observed in laboratory situations, the ability of a conspecific to recognize a molted indi? vidual by olfaction has implications for both social interactions and survival of individu? als in crayfish populations. 68.1 ADELMAN, LM, Institute for Learn? ing Innovation, Annapolis, MD.

S3.5 AERTS, P.*, VAN DAMME, J., HERREL, A., University of Antwerp (UIA), Belgium. Intrinsic mechanics and control of fast cranio-cervical movements in aquatic feeding turtles. Aquatic feeding strikes on agile prey in snake-necked turtles involves fast neck ex? tension, bucco-pharyngo-oesophageal ex? pansion and head retraction. The ultimate, rectilinear acceleration of the head towards the prey requires complex vertebral rota- tions, largely differing from strike to strike. This poses serious control-demands to the numerous intrinsic neck-muscles which are the sole neck extensors. Mathematical mod? elling shows, however, that extensor activity might be redundant for this phase of the strike. The ultimate head acceleration al? ways goes along with forceful bucco-pha- ryngeal expansion. The momentum of the thus induced suction flow suffices to pull the head (and the neck) straight towards the prey. The global control of this buccal ex? pansion proceeds identically to what is ob? served in primary aquatic feeders : through a rostro-caudal expansion sequence char? acterized by an optimal timing of the func? tional components supporting the expansion wave. Yet, distinct structural solutions, both at the skeletal and muscular level, are in? volved. This points towards prominent hy? drodynamic constraints. Extrinsic neck muscles retract the head and neck. Given the high number of degrees of freedom, this musculo-skeletal system is obviously under- determined which compromises control. Er- roneous neck folding might be avoided through the presence of a subtle click sys? tem at the level of the joint between cervical 5 and 6. 24.4 AHN, A.N., University of California, Berkeley, CA. Using in vivo stimulation and strain conditions to explain how two muscles function differently under identical condi? tions. Even when experiencing identical strain and stimulation conditions, two leg muscles of the cockroach, Blaberus discoidalis, func? tion differently. Both muscles are innervated by the same, single excitatory motor neu? ron, extend a single degree-of-freedom joint, and have similar twitch kinetics and similar force-length and force-velocity properties when maximally stimulated. When both muscles were strained cyclically and stimu? lated phasically under identical conditions (8 Hz; 15% strain; in vivo stimulation pattern determined during running), muscle 178 generated mechanical energy over a cycle (10.1 W kg-1; n = 5), while muscle 179 ab? sorbed net mechanical energy (-14.7 W kg 1; n = 6). Forces generated during shorten? ing determined the main difference in me? chanical function between the two muscles. Although the force-length relationships of muscles 178 and 179 were similar when maximally stimulated, the force-length rela? tionships when submaximally stimulated showed that muscle 178 generated higher forces at shorter lengths than muscle 179. Differences between the two muscles in their submaximal force-length relationships and in force enhancement after a passive stretch could account for approximately 85% of the difference in peak force generated between the two muscles during oscillatory contrac? tions. Using the in vivo conditions and ex? amining the history-dependent properties of these muscles provide clues to how the muscles function differently under identical cyclical conditions. Understanding the func? tional consequences of submaximal stimu? lation and contraction history can reveal dif? ferences in force generation that are not apparent during maximally stimulated muscle in isometric and isotonic measure? ments.

Statically stable gaits are possible for quadrupeds but do not seem to be used; a discussion of turtles shows why they may be disadvantageous. Physical and mathematical models have shown that pas? sive bipedal walking machines can be dy- namically stable for motion in the sagittal plane, but not in roll. Accelerations and de- celerations of animals may be limited by muscle strength, by the coefficient of friction with the ground, or by considerations of sta? bility. Cornering ability similarly may be lim? ited by strength or by the coefficient of fric? tion. A simple mathematical model shows that it may be faster to use a longer route with corners of larger radius,than a shorter one with sharper corners. The concepts of oversteer and understeer,as applied to wheeled vehicles, may throw light on the stability of running.

Biting is a distinct means of feeding in fishes in which upper and lower jaws forc- ibly grasp, tear, or cut the prey. Biting is a common mode of feeding in many groups of fishes, including parrotfishes, wrasses, cichlids, triggerfishes, surgeonfishes, dam- selfishes, and characins, yet the kinematics and motor patterns of this behavior have re? ceived relatively little attention compared to suction feeding. To quantify the muscular motor pattern of biting and to identify aspects of it that appear to be phylogenetically con? served, we recorded activity from the epaxialis, levator operculi, sternohyoideus, and subdivisions of the adductor mandibulae during the bite in species of parrotfishes, wrasses, and serrasalminae. In parrotfishes, significant species-level differ? ences were found in the duration and timing of muscle activity, suggesting that the motor control of biting is evolutionarily plastic at relatively low phylogenetic levels. To deter? mine if biting motor patterns differ signifi? cantly from suction feeding motor patterns, we used MANOVA and principal compo? nents analysis to compare EMGs of biting and suction-feeding taxa. The multivariate space occupied by biting and suction feed? ing is constrained by the motor control re- quirement of opening and then closing the jaws. However, biting in parrotfishes was significantly different than suction feeding in other teleosts, although there was a high degree of overlap among all feeding strikes. Many biters also showed little or no epaxialis activity, suggesting that, in contrast to suc? tion feeding, cranial elevation is relatively unimportant in biting.

The nesting behavior of the green turtle, Chelonia mydas, was observed dur? ing high population density period (June- October) and low population density period (Nov-May) in Ras Al-Hadd, Sultanate of Oman. Oman hosts one of the largest nest? ing populations in the world. The degree of crowding during the nesting season reveal some information on the way the turtles "ad? just" to the seasonal changes to some eco? logical factors such as the availability of nest sites, and the location of the nests relative to the tidal zone. During low density, the turtles tend to build their nest away from the tidal zone and the frequency of nesting near or inside the tidal zone is low. During high den? sity, the frequency of choosing the nests near or inside the tidal zone increases signifi? cantly even when there is less crowding and more nesting areas are available in a giving night. Based on these conditions, we sug? gest that the turtles become aware of the crowding condition before they ascend on the beaches as they gather near the nesting grounds. The significant of such nesting strat? egy will be discussed. 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

We present a test of the hypothesis that inspiration of hyperoxic air increases hum? mingbird hovering performance when birds are challenged aerodynamically. We mea? sured the maximum duration of hovering flight and the simultaneous oxygen con? sumption of ruby-throated hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris) in low density heliox that was either normoxic (21% 02) or hyperoxic (35% 02). As density decreased, hummingbirds in hyperoxia significantly in? creased hovering duration, down to the den? sity at which birds could no longer sustain hovering flight. At this final density, skeletal muscle activity appears to be anaerobic and independent of oxygen concentration. Hum? mingbirds in hyperoxia showed no signifi? cant increase in oxygen consumption at lower densities. Additionally, we tested the birds ability to discriminate between artifi? cial flowers infused with either normoxic or hyperoxic gases. Even after a full day of train? ing birds failed to associate oxygen concen? tration with a particular flower, independent of air density. Supplemental oxygen thus yields increased hovering duration but the minimum density at which birds can fly is limited exclusively by aerodynamic consid- erations. 69.1 AMUNDSON, R., University of Hawaii at Hilo. Evo versus devo: methodological conflicts in the treatment of variation. Evolutionary and developmental biology were independent enterprises for most of the twentieth century. Differences in goals led to differences and even inconsistencies in methodologies and practices. One of the tasks of an integrative program of evolution? ary developmental biology will be to negoti- ate these inconsistencies. Among the most difficult may be conflicts in the ways varia? tion is dealt with. For example, the evolu? tionary antagonism towards typology may be irreconcilable with such organizational developmental concepts as the Bauplan. Is it possible to be a population thinker while simultaneously conceiving of evolution as changes in developmental processes? 24.2 ANDERSON, B.D.*, FULL, R.J., GARCIA, M., University of California, Berke? ley, CA. A spring-mass model of centipede locomotion. The laterally undulating Arizona centi? pede, Scolopendra heros, uses a metachronal gait in which all legs on the concave side of the bent body touch the ground at a single point. Each leg of the wave of legs traveling through this point is not on the ground for a long enough period to aid in understanding centipede locomo? tor dynamics. However, as a wave of legs travels through this one point of ground con? tact, the individual legs combine to gener? ate ground reaction forces (GRFs) and me? chanical energies (MEs) of the center of mass that are similar to a spring. This is analo? gous to the spring-like behavior of all legs in contact with the ground at a time, or the "vir? tual leg," in symmetrical gaits. We model each wave of centipede legs as a "virtual wave-spring." Centipedes have several points of leg contact, or virtual wave-springs, on the ground generating force at any given time. Therefore, we modeled centipede whole-body locomotor dynamics as the sum of several virtual wave-springs. The period of each virtual wave-spring and the lag be? tween successive virtual wave-springs were altered to model different kinematic condi? tions. Our model predicts that only under unobserved kinematic conditions would cen? tipedes demonstrate whole-body dynamics of a rolling wheel, as predicted by Gray (1953), or have whole-body GRF and ME patterns that complete a full cycle in a typicallyfidefined stride period. The model predicts that under most conditions, the whole-body GRF and ME patterns will com? plete a full cycle in the period it takes for a wave of legs to complete its contact with the ground and the next wave of legs to be set on the ground. The period of time a wave of centipede legs is on the ground is analo? gous to the stride period in symmetrical gaits. 928 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Anatomical evidence for brainstem circuits mediating hypoglos- sal motor output in the leopard frog, Rana pipiens. Using injections of fluorescein dextran amine (FDA) combined with activity-depen- dent uptake of sulforhodamine 101 (SR101), brainstem circuits presumed to be involved in hypoglossal motor output were investi? gated. Injections into the cerebellar cortex combined with retrograde labeling of the pe? ripheral hypoglossal nerve demonstrate convergence at the level of the medial re- ticular formation. This convergence suggests an integrative region for afferent feedback from the hypoglossal nerve and information through the Purkinje cell layer of the cer? ebellar cortex. Injections of FDA into the cer? ebellar nuclei also demonstrate a bilateral efferent projection to the hypoglossal motor neurons. The SR101 data suggest a recip? rocal pathway between the medulla and the trigeminal nuclei. This pathway was identi? fied through peripheral hypoglossal stimu? lation while SR101 was bath applied to a semi-intact brainstem preparation. Addition- ally, the SR101 uptake clearly labeled the ventrolateral hypoglossal nuclei, the medial reticular formation and the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellar cortex. The trigeminal nu? clei coordinate the motor output of the leva? tor mandibulae complex, the mouth closing muscles, and this pathway may provide a mechanism for coordinating tongue move? ments (through hypoglossal nuclei) with jaw movements during feeding. Taken together, these data provide additional insight for un? derstanding the neurophysiological path? ways used to coordinate the proper timing of feeding motor output in anurans. 1.3 ANDERSON, E.J. *, MCGILLIS, WR., GROSENBAUGH, M.A., Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Boundary layer flow in fish and squid. A complete hydrodynamic understand? ing of aquatic locomotion requires knowl? edge of the thin boundary layer surrounding swimming organisms. In particular, tangen- tial forces acting on the body surface are dependent on the distribution of velocity throughout the boundary layer. Fluid veloci? ties tangent and normal to the bodies of swim- ming fish and squid were determined throughout the boundary layer (1-1 Omm thick) by digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) and digital particle tracking velocimetry (DPTV). Scup (Stenotomus chrysops), smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis), mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi) and long- finned squid {Loligo pealei) were observed. The friction drag on swimming fish was de? termined to be greater than the rigid body friction drag. No separation of flow was ob? served and the shape of boundary layer velocity profiles suggested that the fish were sensing and responding to the surrounding fluid to prevent separation. Both laminar and turbulent flow were observed in the bound? ary layer under various conditions, and flow sometimes oscillated between the two states with body phase. The behavior of the bound? ary layers of the carangiform swimming scup and the anguilliform swimming smooth dog? fish showed marked differences. Boundary layer flow in mottled sculpin, which spend most of their time stationary on the substrate, was shown to be greatly impacted by the orientation of the pectoral fins. The findings support the existence of different sensory functions in the lateral line system anterior and posterior to the pectoral fins as sug? gested by structural differences. In L. pealei, the boundary layer yielded estimates of fric? tion drag, and the effect of boundary layer suction at the mantle intake was observed. 5.6 ANDERSON, EE.*, FOSTER, P.G., Southern Illinois University, IL, The Natural History Museum, London. Tests of ecdysozoan monophyly using molecular se? quence data. Some analyses of 18S ribosomal RNA sequence data have supported monophyly of Ecdysozoa, a superphylum composed of taxa that possess periodically molted chiti- nous cuticles (e.g., Arthropoda, Onychophora, Priapulaand Nematoda). The Ecdysozoa hypothesis already has been accepted by many researchers, and this hy? pothesis (particularly the proposed close re- lationship between nematodes and arthropods) has been used to understand 800-955-1236 ?

Recently, however, evidence from multiple nuclear protein-cod? ing genes has been presented suggesting that Ecdysozoa (or at least a Nematoda + Arthropoda clade) is not monophyletic. To evaluate support for ecdysozoan mono- phyly, we added nematode sequences to previously published alignments for the 18S gene and several nuclear protein-coding genes and reanalyzed the data using maxi? mum parsimony and maximum likelihood (including heterogeneous ML models, in which model parameters such as base com? position can be estimated separately for particular branches). We also analyzed alignments of two other genes (the nuclear elongation factor-1 alpha gene and the mi? tochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene). Finally, we used a taxon jackknifing approach with the 18S, EF-1 alpha and COI alignments to assess the role of taxon sam? pling in estimating ecdysozoan relationships. Our findings suggest that support for Ecdysozoa across multiple data sets and taxon samples is not unambiguous, and we argue that the use of the Ecdysozoa hypoth? esis for inferring character evolution within Nematoda may be premature.

The Draper Laboratory Vorticity Control Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (VCUUV) is the first mission-scale, autonomous under? water vehicle which uses vorticity control propulsion and maneuvering. Built as a re? search platform with which to study the en? ergetics and maneuvering performance of fish-swimming propulsion, the VCUUV is a self-contained free swimming research ve? hicle which follows the morphology and ki? nematics of a yellowfin tuna. The forward half of the vehicle is comprised of a rigid hull which houses batteries, electronics, ballast and hydraulic power unit. The aft section is a freely flooded articulated robot tail with is terminated with a lunate caudal fin. Utilizing optimized body and tail kinematics from the MIT Robotuna experiments, the VCUUV has demonstrated stable steady swimming up to 2.4 knots and aggressive maneuvering trajectories with turning rates up to 75 de? grees per second. This paper summarizes the vehicle maneuvering and stability per? formance observed in field trials and com- pares the results to predicted performance using theoretical and empirical techniques. P3ABANDREWS, A.L.*, HATLE, J.D., CROWLEY, M.C, JULIANO, S.A., Illinois State University Hemolymph protein pro? files during egg production in three popula? tions of the Eastern lubber grasshopper. Distant populations of a given organism can be predicted to have reproductive physi- ologies that are adapted to their local envi? ronment. For example, to avoid a reproduc? tive output of zero, populations of univoltine species from locations with shorter growing seasons could be predicted to reproduce sooner than populations from locations with longer growing seasons. In particular, a tran? sition from a developmentally flexible phase to a developmentally inflexible phase (that requires a set amount of time) could be ex? pected to occur sooner in populations from shorter growing seasons. Lubber grasshop? pers are univoltine and exhibit low vagility. In addition, they have flexible reproductive timing during the first half of the oviposition cycle but initiate inflexible reproductive tim? ing during the second half of the oviposition cycle. The maximum titer of total hemolymph protein (=TPmax) in lubbers occurs during this inflexible phase. Here, we test whether lati- tudinally distinct populations of lubbers dif? fer in their timing of reproductive develop? ment, as indicated by the timing of TPmax. We predicted that the time from adult eclosion to TPmax (i.e. the flexible phase) would be great? est in Florida, intermediate in Louisiana, and Iowest in Georgia lubbers. Contrary to pre? diction, times from eclosion to TPmax did not differ among the populations. Time from TPmax to oviposition (i.e. the inflexible phase), however, was significantly greater for LA hoppers than GA hoppers. Our data sug? gest that the duration of the canalized phase differs among populations and raises the possibility that these differences may be adaptive for reproduction in the correspond? ing local environments.

How do embryos incubated at higher temperatures spend less energy during in? cubation? In some reptiles, the energetic cost of development remains the same or even decreases with increased incubation tem? perature. The surprisingly low energy expen? diture of embryos at high incubation tem? peratures may be caused by either of two mechanisms: 1) a shorter incubation peri? ods coupled with a relatively low thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate, or 2) acclima? tion of metabolic rate to incubation tempera? ture. In the eastern fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus, incubation period is shortened by 50% when incubation temperature is in? creased by 10 C. Consequently, embryos must have a Q10 of 2.0 or lower to stabilize the energetic cost of development. Other? wise, thermal acclimation of metabolic rate must occur during development. We quanti? fied the thermal sensitivity of embryonic me? tabolism in S. undulatus with repeated mea? sures of metabolic rate at 27, 31, and 34 C. Similar to adult reptiles, metabolic rate of embryos increased significantly with in? creased body temperature, from 1.5 J h1 at 27 C to 2.2 J h-1 at 34 C.The Q10 of metabolic rate from 27 to 31 C was only 1.6, which is much lower than Q10s of 2.0 to 3.0 that have been observed in adults. However, the Q10 of metabolic rate from 31 to 34 C was 2.7. Therefore, thermal acclimation must play a role in reducing the energetic cost of devel? opment at incubation temperatures that are higher than 31 C. We found that embryos did acclimate to incubation temperature; em? bryos incubated at 32 C had a lower meta? bolic rate than embryos incubated at 28 C, when both were measured at 30 C. Both the low thermal sensitivity and thermal acclima? tion of metabolic rate play a role in stabiliz? ing the energetic cost of development in S. undulatus.

The ecology and physiology of the marine echiuran worm, Urechis caupo: a model animal for demon? stration of physiological principles. Urechis caupo is a large echiuran worm endemic to the California coast. Popu? lations of these worms inhabit individual, well ventilated, U-shaped burrows in the marine mudflat. Urechis is a non-selective filter feeder which uses an intricate mucus net to trap its particulate food. Although enriched in organic material, the mudflat habitat is subject to periodic exposure to toxic sulfide and hypoxia during low tide events. Over the last 14 years our laboratory group has investigated the ecophysiology of this ani? mal ? including the ecology, behavior, mor? phology, physiology, metabolism, and cellu? lar biochemistry that allow it to flourish in the challenging mudflat environment. One over- riding observation has emerged: this unique echiuran worm demonstrates numerous specialized adaptations that provide an ex? cellent demonstration of a variety of physi? ological principles. This presentation will at- tempt to synthesize all we have learned from ecological and physiological studies, start? ing with Fisher and MacGinitie 1928, into an overview of the natural history and biology of this unusual animal, and will highlight the usefulness of Urechis as a model in the teaching and research laboratory. 800-955-1236 ?

Distribution of arginine vasoto- cin in the brain of a non-vocalizing anuran (Ascaphus truei). Tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei} are endemic to the Pacific Northwest and are considered the most primitive extant anuran. In addi? tion, unlike most anurans, they do not vocal- ize. Arginine vasotocin (AVT) is a neuropep? tide that modulates many amphibian repro? ductive behaviors, including mating calls. The distribution of AVT-immunoreactive (AVT-ir) cells in the brain of Ascaphus could provide insight into AVT control of behavior in amphibians. We used immunocytochem- istry and a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against vasopressin to detect putative AVT- ir cells and fibers in brains from adult male and female Ascaphus. The overall distribu? tion of immunoreactivity was more restricted in Ascaphus than previously reported for other anurans. Significant populations of AVT-ir cells were found in the magnocellular preoptic nucleus and suprachiasmatic nucleus in the diencephalon. A much smaller population of cells was found span- ning the dorsal and ventral striatum. AVT-ir fibers were found in some areas that control vocal behavior in other anurans. AVT may thus have alternative functions in these ar? eas in Ascaphus. Supported by NSF IBN95- 14305. S6.1 ASHLEY-ROSS, M.A.*, GILLIS, G.B., Wake Forest University, Harvard University. A brief history of functional morphology. The discipline of functional morphology grew out of a descriptive comparative ana? tomical tradition; its transformation into a modern experimental science facilitated largely by technological advances. Early morphologists, such as Cuvier and Thomp? son, felt that function was predictable from organismal form, to the extent that animals and plants represented perfect adaptations to their habits. However, anatomy alone could not inform morphologists how organ? isms actually performed their activities. Re? cording techniques capable of capturing fast motion were first required to begin to under? stand animal movement. Muybridge is per? haps most famous for his pioneering work in fast photography, enabling him to "freeze" images of even the fastest horse at a full gallop. In fact, what functional morphologists now practice as kinematic analysis grew di? rectly out of the techniques Muybridge de? veloped. Marey, though lesser known than Muybridge, made perhaps an even greater contribution to experimental science through his invention of automatic apparati for re? cording events of animal motion. Thus func? tional morphologists could begin to make reasonable predictions of how the muscu? loskeletal system generated movement, as well as provide the structural foundations of form. In the middle ofthe 20th century, scien? tists discovered a way to record what the muscles of an awake, behaving animal were doing. The technique of electromyography, initially used extensively, in clinical applica? tions, was co-opted as a tool of comparative functional anatomy by researchers such as Gans and colleagues. High-speed kinematic analysis and electromyography have for many years been the mainstay of experi? mental technique in functional morphology. In recent years, functional morphology has begun to branch out to incorporate ap? proaches from other disciplines, and now stands at the threshold of becoming a truly integrative, central field in organismal biol? ogy.

Both parasites started dividing from their flagellar ends and T.musculiand T lewisi daughter cells were formed within 48 hour. Trypanosoma lewisi did not form ro- sette-like pattern around the adherent cells and remained as trypomastigote forms. It is also observed that after 48 hour in culture, T lewisi were able to divide without attaching to the adherent cells. However, the unavail- ability of the adherent splenic cells in vitro led the parasites to transform into round non- viable forms. 4.2 AZIZI, E.*, LANDBERG, T, BRAINERD, E.L., University of Massachu? setts, Amherst. Kinematics and performance of the escape response in an aquatic sala? mander, Eurycea bislineata. Despite the large body of information on the aquatic escape response of fishes, the kinematics and neurobiology of fast-starts in salamanders remain poorly understood. We examine the effect of ontogenetic changes in morphology on escape perfor? mance in larval and adult two-lined sala? manders, Eurycea bislineata. The two life stages of this lungless stream salamander overlap in body size. Body length in our sample ranged from 4.8 to 6.4 cm in larvae and 5.8 to 7.5 cm in adults. At metamorpho? sis, these salamanders lose the tail fin which reduces the lateral profile in the caudal re? gion of the adults. Analysis of cross-sec- tions at various body positions reveals a de? crease in the relative muscle mass of adults. We elicited escape responses using tactile stimuli directed at the forelimbs of E. bislineata. The observed kinematics, which consist of a preparatory and a propulsive phase, resemble the C-starts described for numerous fish species. The duration of stage 1 (C-forming phase) was found to increase with body length. Maximum body curvature (measured at the end of stage 1) varied be? tween larval and adult salamanders. Be? cause differences in relative muscle mass and lateral profile have been shown to ef? fect escape performance in fish, we hypoth? esize that the observed morphological and kinematic variation in larval and adult E. bislineata will lead to differences in escape performance.

At high elevations, hibernators such as Belding's ground squirrels (Spermophilus beldingi) emerge through snow and are un? able to forage for the first few weeks of spring. Potentially, these individuals face a trade-off between allocating limited energy and nu? trients to re-establishing physiological func? tion, and the need to fuel activity associated with the brief breeding period which also occurs at this time. Immune function appears to be among the systems that show some degree of regeneration after emergence. Blood smears were collected periodically from squirrels from May (days after emer? gence) through August allowing me to fol- low changes in individual profiles over time. Two measures were taken from these slides - a differential leukocyte count and a mea? sure of the relative number of leukocytes relative to erythrocytes. The analyses focus on the populations of immature and mature neutrophils, lymphocytes, and immature leu? kocytes as other cell types were rare. The time series indicate a progressive matura? tion of the leukocyte population and an in? crease in the relative number of leukocytes. Associations between leukocyte counts and individual behavior and body composition will also be presented.

Numerous investigators are now mea- suring stroke volume of developing verte? brates by optical examination. The standard method for many animals, including zebrafish larvae, involves fixing the larvae, and cap- turing two dimensional video of lateral views of the beating heart through an inverted mi? croscope. To arrive at a volume, the zebrafish heart is assumed to be in the shape a pro? late spheroid. However, during early larval 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

To assess stroke volume, and then, calculate cardiac output in these young larvae, a third dimensional measurement is needed. Our technique in? volves securing the living, intact larva, in a low temperature melting point agarose cyl? inder. The larva is then rotated through a full 180 degrees beginning at one lateral view, through the ventral view, to the other lateral view. The resulting three dimensional rep? resentation of the developing heart as it beats allows for more accurate calculation of diastolic and systolic volume, and hence stroke volume and cardiac output. In addi? tion, this technique allows us to quantify the formation and three dimensional shape of vessels during early development. (sup? ported by NSF IBN 98-96388).

EMGs from the tail muscles of male tur? keys (Meleagris gallopavo) vary in ampli? tude between flight and display. In flight, cau? dal tail muscles yield high amplitude EMGs typical of twitch fibers. ln display, male tur? keys fan, raise, and turn their tails with little or no EMG activity. Slow-tonic muscle fibers (type III) like those found in the avian M. latis- simus dorsi cranialis were hypothesized to be responsible for display postures, which can be maintained for several hours. Such tonic fibers do not propagate action poten? tials thereby explaining lack of conspicuous EMG signals. Histochemical staining for mATPase was used to characterize tail muscle fiber types. The primary muscles in? volved in raising the tail (M. levator caudae pars vertebralis, M. levator caudae pars rectricalis) and in fanning (M. bulbi rectricium) all show mixed populations of slow-twitch (type I) and fast-twitch (type II) fibers. The muscle previously assumed to turn the tail (M. lateralis caudae) contains only fast-twitch (type II) fibers. No slow-tonic (type III) fibers have been identified in any caudal muscle. However, avian slow-twitch fibers are also multiply innervated, unlike mammalian slow-twitch fibers. Despite their innervation, avian slow-twitch fibers are of? ten considered to be action potential- propogating. Our histochemical results, to? gether with EMG activities, suggest that avian slow-twitch fibers are responsible for maintaing tail posture during display. P3.33 BAKER, P.J., Miami University. Onto? genetic changes in plastral callosities of the Senegal flapshell turtle, Cyclanorbis senegalensis. The number and location of the plastral callosities are reliable characters used to distinguish adults of the Senegal f lap-shelled turtle, Cyclanorbis senegalensis, from its congener the Nubian flap-shelled turtle, C. elegans. Adult C. senegalensis have seven to nine callosities present on the plastron including five preplastral callosities whereas adult C. elegans have a maximum of four callosities with no preplastral callosities. However, difficulties in identification arise when comparing specimens of different sizes and sexes. After examining a large series of live C. senegalensis, with specimens rang? ing from juvenile to adult, I have observed that the development of the plastral callosi? ties is determined by both the size and sex of the individual. Females attain a greater carapace length (CL) than males; and thus males develop a full complement of nine callosities at a smaller CL than females. The number, size, and shape of the plastral cal? losities of C. senegalensis can be used as both a character to distinguish male from female specimens, as well as a diagnostic character to distinguish between species.

Effect of wind and growth on the thermoregulatory metabolism of Arctic-breeding shorebird chicks Many Arctic-breeding shorebird chicks leave the nest and forage with one or both parents soon after hatching. Chicks may be exposed to temperatures near 0?C, and tun? dra habitats offer little shelter from wind. Parental attentiveness prevents severe hy- pothermia, but foraging time may be limited by thermoregulatory competence.

Chicks ranged from 9 to 107g in mass and were generally 85 to 350 hours old during measurements. Mea? surements were made at wind speeds of 0.1, 0.8,1.8 and 3.0 m/s. Air temperatures ranged from 15 to 30?C, depending on age and spe? cies, and were selected so that standard op? erative temperatures always fell somewhat below the lower critical temperature. While chicks can withstand temperatures below 10?C for short periods with no wind, they frequently became hypothermic during ex? tended (2 hour) measurements below 20?C with wind. Normothermic body temperatures during measurements averaged 39 ?1?C for dowitchers and whimbrels. Sandpiper body temperature increased with age from 37 ?C at 170 hours to 39 ?C at 220 hours. As wind u increased from 0.1 to 3 m/s, mass-specific thermal conductance, /C(W/g-?C) increased 62% for sandpipers, 42% for dowitchers, and 35% for whimbrels.

Maneu? vering hydrodynamics of fish and small un? derwater vehicles The understanding of fish maneuvering and its application to underwater rigid bod? ies are considered. The goal is to gain in? sight into stealth.The recent progress made in NUWC is reviewed. Fish morphology sug? gests that control fins for good maneuver- ability have unique scalar relationships irre- spective of their speed type. Maneuvering experiments are carried out with fish that are fast yet maneuverable. The gap in maneu- verability between fish and small underwa? ter vehicles is quantified. The hydrodynam? ics of a dorsal fin based brisk maneuvering device and a dual flapping foil device, as applied to rigid cylindrical bodies, are de? scribed. The role of pectoral wings in ma? neuvering and station keeping near surface waves is discussed. A pendulum model of dolphin swimming is presented to show that body length and tail flapping frequency are related. The mechanism of discrete and de- terministic vortex shedding from the oscillat? ing control surfaces has the property of large amplitude unsteady forcing and an exquis- ite phase dependence, which makes it in- herently amenable to active control for pre- cision maneuvering.Theoretical control stud? ies demonstrate the feasibility of maneuver? ability of biologically-inspired bodies under surface waves. The application of fish hy? drodynamics to the silencing of propulsors is considered. Two strategies for the reduc? tion of radiated noise are developed. The effects of a reduction of RPM are modeled. The active cambering of blades made of digi- tally programmable artificial muscles, and their thrust enhancement, are demonstrated. Next, wake momentum filling is carried out by artificial muscles at the trailing edge of a stator blade of an upstream stator propulsor, and articulating them like a fish tail. A reduc? tion of blade tonals is demonstrated theo- retically. PZMBARAGONA, M.A.*, HAIG-LADEWIG, LA., WANG, S.Y, University of Southern Mis? sissippi, Hattiesburg.

The effect of fiber type heterogeneity on work and power out? put of hindlimb muscles of the tiger sala? mander. Most vertebrate muscles are composed of a mixture of fiber types. However, study of the mechanical performance of muscle has concentrated on homogeneous bundles of muscle fibers. Muscles in the hindlimb of the tiger salamander, Ambystoma tigrinum, present an excellent opportunity to explore the consequences of fiber heterogeneity on work and power output. Isometric twitches and work loops were performed in vitro on two muscles, the M. iliotibialis pars posterior (ILTP; heterogeneous, containing SO, FOG and FG fibers) and the M. iliofibularis (ILFB; homogeneous, containing FOG fibers only). Maximal isometric twitch force in the ILTP was over twice as great as in the ILFB; how? ever, when adjusted for cross-sectional area, mean isometric stress was statistically in- distinguishable (ILTP: 46.2 +/- 21.4 kN/m2; ILFB: 40.1 +/- 21.5 kN/m2). Work loops were performed over a range of frequencies (0.5 h 3.0 Hz) that encompassed the observed range of in vivo limb cycling frequencies. The homogeneous ILFB showed a steady de? cline in work per cycle from 1.5 n 3.0 Hz, while power output over those frequencies remained nearly constant. The heteroge? neous ILTP showed a different pattern, with a tri-modal distribution for work per cycle with peaks at 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 Hz, and maximal power output at 2.5 Hz. The differences in mechanical performance between the ILTP and ILFB may relate to the musciesf function during locomotion. The ILFB is active at the beginning of the swing phase, and serves to lift the hindlimb from the ground. Steady power output may be required for this ballis- tic-like movement, as the weight of the limb is unchanging. In contrast, the ILTP functions to extend the knee, and thus can contribute to forward propulsion. High power output at high cycling frequencies may indicate the ILTP assists fast locomotion.

Morphological and allozyme variation in Chirostoma grandocule Steindachner (Pi? sces: Atherinopsidae) from Lake Ptzcuaro, Mexico. We investigated the levels of population differentiation of the silverside fish species Chirostoma grandocule Steindachner in Lake Ptzcuaro based on morphometric and allozyme data and relate such information to aspects of life history and changes in their natural habitat. We analysed eighteen mor? phometric characters, eight meristic and eleven putative enzyme-coding loci from C. grandocule samples of two different locali? ties ("subpopulations") within the lake and of three different years (Janitzio 1996,1999 and Ichupio 1997). Principal Component (PC) analysis with the morphometric data indicate the separation of two groups (grouped into four components, 66.78%). Among the variables that contributed the highest variation were: pelvic fin length of base (PfbL), head length (HL), eye diameter (ED), dorsal 2nd lengh (D2L) and snout length (SnL). Discriminant analysis (DA) with morphometric data also indicated separa? tion between samples (87.10% correctly clas- sified) Janitzio and Ichupio (Wilk's l= 0.13- 48, P&lt; 0.000). Allozyme data resolved seven polymorphic loci at P.99 level. C. grandocule showed levels of He that ranged from 0.0134 to 0.0319 (average HS = 0.0234). Genetic differences were observed between years and between "subpopulations", with six al? leles of Janitzio never detected in Ichupio and one of Ichupio not present in both years of Janitzio samples. Genetic distances (DR &amp; co-ancestry) between samples ranged from 0.0154 to 0.0341. Weir &amp; Cockerham's F-statistics provided evidence of significant heterogeneity among "subpopulations" and years (jack-knifed qS = 0.0252, S.D. 0.0126). Our morphometric and allozyme results are consistent and suggest that Chirostoma grandocule is encountering an actual pro? cess of population differentiation in lake Ptzcuaro. 936 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

Flow pat? terns around boxfishes: role of body keels in dynamic stability. The tropical marine boxfishes and their relatives (family Ostraciidae) are some of the most highly specialized living bony fishes. The forward 2/3 to 3/4 of their bodies are covered by rigid bony tests, which restrict body movements to their fins and the poste? rior sections of their tails. Recent field and laboratory observations indicate that these fishes demonstrate great maneuverability, dynamic stability, and course control. The diversity in body architecture and keel char? acteristics among the ostraciids makes it possible to determine the roles of the bony tests in maintaining stability. Various features of the tests of four morphologically distinct ostraciids were measured to develop a bet? ter understanding of body variation in this group. Flow patterns in the wakes and along the bodies of stereolithographic models of ostraciid fishes positioned at various angles of attack in a water tunnel were measured using digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) to determine how test morphology impacts flow and ultimately dynamic stabil? ity. Significant differences in test character? istics, such as relative location of maximum test height/width, number and angle of keels, and degree of lateral/ventral body curvature, were detected among the four ostraciids. These differences impacted flow patterns around the models. At angles of attack greater than 5 degrees or less than -5 de? grees, vorticies developed most prominently around sharp, ventral, posterior keels with adjacent concave channeling. These vorti- ces, which occurred posterior to the center of mass and produced upward directed forces at positive angles of attack and down? ward directed forces at negative angles of attack, presumably provide self-correcting forces that aid rigid-bodied swimmers in pitch control.

Fishes display a wide diversity in their physiological responses to stress. Primary endocrine responses to acute stress include the release of catecholamine and corticos? teroid hormones into circulation. Corticos? teroids, chiefly cortisol, are released by the interrenal tissue, the adrenal homologue in fish, which is concentrated in the anterior portion of the kidney in teleostean fishes but found more diffusely scattered throughout the kidney in chondrosteans. Elevations in circulating cortisol during the first hour after an acute disturbance can increase from rela? tively low resting levels to between about 20 and &gt;1,000 ng/mL, depending on species. Basal teleost groups, such as salmonids, generally exhibit lower responses than de? rived species, such as the percids, although environmental and developmental factors strongly influence the stress response in fish. Some of these factors include temperature, nutritional state, water quality, and prior ex? posure to stressors. Chondrosteans, spe? cifically scaphirhynchid sturgeons and paddlefish, show post-stress cortisol eleva? tions to &lt;10 ng/mL following a similar acute stressor, which is much lower than those in teleosts. These differences in primary re? sponses appear to be reflected in their sec? ondary physiological responses to stress, such as changes in plasma glucose, lactate and chloride, which also appear to be much lower in chondrosteans than in teleosts. Brain serotonergic activity, which has been implicated in regulation of the hypothalamic- pituitary-interrenal axis during stress, also appears to be appreciably lower in chondrostean fishes than in teleosts. To date, little comparative work has been done in elasmobranch fishes, which release 1AL- PHA-hydroxycorticosterone as the principle corticosteroid. P1.37BAUMANN, NL*, LIGHT, D.B., Ripon College.

The hemolytic index (Hl) decreased with extracellular ATP (50 MICROmolar) and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (0.5 MICROmolar). In contrast, Hl increased with the purinoceptor antagonist suramin (100 MICROmolar) and the PLA2 inhibitorONO-OS-082 (10 MICROmolar). In- terestingly, A23187 (0.5 MICROmolar) re? versed the inhibitory effect of suramin (100 MICROmolar), indicating the Ca2+-depen- dent step was downstream of a P2 receptor. Extracellular ATP (50 MICROmolar) did not reverse the antagonistic affect of ONO-OS- 082 (10 MICROmolar), suggesting that P2 receptor activation occurred prior to produc? tion of arachidonic acid. The percent volume recovery of cells following hypotonic shock (0.5X Ringer), measured with a Coulter counter, increased with extracellular ATP (50 MICROmolar) and A23187 (0.5 MICROmolar). In contrast, suramin (100 MICROmolar) inhibited volume recovery; this inhibition was reversed with A23187 (0.5 MICROmolar). Finally, using the whole-cell patch clamp technique, we found ATP (50 MICROmolar) enhanced a K+-conductance that was activated during cell swelling. This current was inhibited by ONO-RS-082 (10 MICROmolar) and suramin (100 MICROmolar). Conclusion: our results are most consistent with extracellular ATP acti? vation of a P2 receptor occurring prior to a rise in intracellular Ca2+. This, in turn, acti? vates PLA2 and subsequent K+ efflux through a conductive pathway. (Supported by NSF grants MCB-9603568 and MCB-0076006.)

Phylogenetic inferences from large data sets can be problematic, with conflict be? tween precision and minimal computer time determining the design of computer pack? ages. We analyzed two large DNA data sets obtained from GenBank and a smaller homoplasy-rich morphological data set to demonstrate inconsistencies among three phylogeny building packages (PHYLIP, HENNING86, and PAUP*4.0). The sequence data was analyzed under the criterion of maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, neighbor joining, and bootstrap where ap- plicable. HENNING86 performed well as a parsimony engine, consistently finding the shortest tree in the least amount of time. However it is the oldest of the four pack- ages and is the only one not offered for Unix, Windows, and Mac operating systems. Random Cladistics is a free upgrade that allows many different analyzing methods. PHYLIP3.5 is a free package that can per? form many different analyzing methods. It is slow and retains an upward limit of only 100 trees, regardless of the number of equally parsimonious trees. Despite its prob? lems, PHYLIP is free, has the best online help, and is a well integrated package. An alpha version of PHYLIP3.6, released this year, is still slow. It is more plastic and has added an adjustable maximum number of trees. PAUP*4.0 is the most refined of the four programs. It has the greatest number of available options. It is relatively quick and easy to navigate in the point and click for- mat. However, the available options may be daunting to novice users. PAUP*is the best overall package for serious researchers.

Low ph effects on the killing activity of oyster hemocytes.

Experiments were carried out at pH 7.6 and 6.6 mimicking the in vivo hemolymph environment within the oyster under well aerated conditions (7.6) and during air exposure (6.6). Assays were carried out using 96-well plates to expose hemocytes to Vibrio (1:20 ratio) for 3 hours at room temperature during which time the hemocytes phagocytized the Vibrio. The ph? agocytosis stage of the assay was termi- nated by adding 0.2% Tween to the wells, killing the hemocytes but not the Vibrio. A 938 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

The number of live Vibrio in each well after the growout period was measured using a colorimetric cellproliferation assay. A killing index was calculated based on the number of Vibrio in wells with hemocytes compared to their control wells (i.e., with hemocytes killed at time zero). A killing in? dex of Vibrio was expressed as a percent? age of the control, e.g., where an index of 50% indicates that 50% of the bacteria were killed by hemocytes. The average killing in? dex at pH 7.7 was 49.2 (1.86 SEM; n=4) and lower, but not significantly different at pH 6.6, 38.8 (1.80 SEM; n=4). Under these assay conditions hemocyte viability, as judged by trypan blue exclusion, was high at the be? ginning of the assay (90.4-98% viable at pH 7.6; 87.4-95% at pH 6.6) and remained high for three hours (83.2-92% viable at pH 7.6; 86-92% at pH 6.6). These results suggest that low pH does not cause a significant re? duction in the killing activity of oyster hemocytes. Supported by NSF-REU DBI- 9876926 &amp; ODRP NA96RG0488.

Determination of locomotor postures in fossil tetrapods is difficult because their be? havior cannot be observed directly. To evalu? ate morphological indicators of limb posture that could be used to interpret stance in ex? tinct tetrapods, we have used multivariate statistical analyses to explore osteological correlates of locomotor posture in extant species. Our sample of extant taxa includes generalized mammals, lizards, and croco? dilians spanning a large size range. Mor? phological measurements and observations relevant to locomotor function were taken from the forelimb, hindlimb and girdle skel? etons of museum specimens. Principal com? ponents analyses as well as bivariate com? parisons of limb and girdle elements indi? cate strong differences between sprawling and non-sprawling taxa. For instance, highly sprawling taxa are characterized by limbs with high angles of femoral torsion, short metatarsals, and reduced articular surfaces on the distal humerus. In contrast, non- sprawling taxa show significantly smaller surface areas than sprawling taxa for the hip, knee, and ankle joints. These analyses suggest several quantifiable morphological features that could aid the evaluation of limb postures in fossil taxa, thereby facilitating the evaluation of changes in limb posture over the evolution of mammalian locomotion.

The random-bred CD-1 mouse is widely favored as a test organism by regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical houses, among others, because of their broad array of geno? types, mimicing the human population. There is, therefore, concern about their continu? ous genetic heterogeneity. We purchased 7 groups of CD-1 mice from the same sup- plier, over a period of several years. The present study compares untreated controls from these 7 "batches";, at 60-65 days post natal, for 88 normally-occurring skeletal vari? ants. Most of the skeletal variants examined each strain-specific values among inbred strains and so are a good indicator of varia? tion. There was significant (P&lt;0.01) varia? tion between groups among 63 variants. Seventeen variants never appeared, and 9 occurred in only 1 specimen in all 7 groups (686 mice). High variability among all groups was seen for 10 variants. Average number of variants for each group that differ in 2- way comparisons with each of the others, and ranges, are: G1 = 21 /16-26, G2 = 18.2 / 16-23, G3 = 20 / 16-23, G4 = 16.7 / 10-26, G5 = 13.8 / 9-19, G6 = 16.5 / 9-25, G7 = 16.2 /13-22.

Endocrine correlates of growth in ocean dwelling coho salmon. Pacific Salmon typically spend 1-3 years foraging and growing in the ocean prior to returning to freshwater spawning sites. In- ter-annual differences in ocean temperatures and productivity may have profound effects on the growth of these animals. Growth varia? tion may influence age of maturation, size at maturation, and overall year-class survival. Thus, understanding variation in oceanic growth rates is important to understanding variation in the fitness of Pacific salmon. However, it is very difficult to measure oce? anic growth rates. Growth is mediated by the endocrine system; consequently, endo? crine correlates of growth may provide a valu? able tool for assessing relative growth rate and related fitness values, based on a single blood sample. We conducted an experiment relating growth rate to plasma hormone lev? els in order to test this idea. Specifically, we individually tagged approximately 1200 yearling coho salmon, placed them in sea? water tanks and assessed growth at two month intervals. Plasma was obtained in September and November and we found a significant, highly correlated (r2&gt;0.5) rela? tion between IGF-I and growth rate. We found little relation between insulin and growth. Subsequently, we obtained samples from coho salmon in the Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound (West Coast of North America). IGF-I data obtained from these samples shows both geographic and interannual variability. These preliminary data suggest that a more extensive sam? pling regime (geographically and tempo- rally) for IGF-I levels of Pacific salmon may give us insight into environmental factors regulating growth and fitness. 38.5 BEE, M.A*, GERHARDT, HC, Uni? versity of Missouri, Columbia. Getting to know you: habituation as a mechanism for territo? rial neighbor recognition. Territorial animals commonly exhibit low levels of aggression toward familiar neigh- bors in their usual territories and high levels of aggression toward strangers and neigh- bors in novel locations. Vocal recognition of neighbors is well known in songbirds, and also has been demonstrated in bullfrogs, Rana catesbeiana. Habituation has been suggested as a learning mechanism for neighbor recognition. However, no study has tested the hypothesis that repeated expo- sures to a neighbor's acoustic signals allow territorial animals to learn about individually distinct signal properties and the usual lo? cation of signal origin. We conducted 3 field playback experiments using a habituation/ discrimination procedure to test the hypoth? esis that habituation functions as a mecha? nism of neighbor recognition in bullfrogs. Synthetic bullfrog calls were broadcast to territorial males during a habituation phase until aggressive responses declined. We then presented novel stimuli during a sub? sequent discrimination phase. In experiment 1, a change in fundamental frequency, an individually distinct call property, elicited re- newed aggression. In experiment 2, a 180? change in stimulus location elicited renewed aggression. In experiment 3, changes in fun? damental frequency, location, or both fre? quency and location elicited renewed ag? gression. Responses were highest to changes in fundamental frequency, and these responses were independent of loca? tion; responses to changes in location alone were intermediate between responses to changes in frequency and controls. Our data indicate that repeated exposure to a neighbor's call resulted in stimulus-specific and location-specific response decrements, suggesting that habituation could function as a mechanism for neighbor recognition in bullfrogs. 940 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

To investigate the role that feeding spe? cialization may play in clade diversification and mode of speciation, I have begun pre? liminary phylogenetic and sterol analyses of Eastern Pacific Patellogastropoda. A phy? logenetic hypothesis for Eastern Pacific Patellogastropoda is constructed using mtDNA sequences from the large ribosomal subunit (16s). This phylogeny identities two putative new species that have sympatric distributions with their respective sister taxa. Both of these taxa share common resources and similar ecotypic forms with their closest sister taxa, indicating that resource partition- ing may not have played a significant role in their diversification. This phylogeny also conf irms that Laustrodigitalis (Murphy, 1978) is the sibling species of Ldigitalis, two spe? cies with parapatric distributions overlapping in central California and similar ecotypic forms. This pattern is consistent with the hy? pothesis that these species diversified as a result of vicariance. Finally, 16s data indi? cate that Linstabilis and Lochracea are two distinct ecological forms of the same spe? cies. A re-evaluation of the systematics of patellogastropod species is needed. Prelimi? nary analyses have been used to identify biogenic sterols in a subset of lottid taxa. Ste- rols incorporated into shell and body tissues can be used to identify diet in recent and fossil gastropods. These sterols can be used to determine past ecologies of fossil patellogastropods, whether resource parti- tioning exists at finer levels, if resource par- titioning has changed through time within lineages, and to identify specialist versus generalist forms. Mapping these data onto a phylogenetic tree will allow me to examine the evolutionary history of feeding and re? source partitioning of patellogastropods, which may shed light on the role of feeding specialization in clade diversification.

Survival and the physiological stress response in Cascades frog tadpoles exposed to ambi? ent UV-B radiation in the field. Global environmental changes, includ? ing increases in ultraviolet-B radiation (UV- B; 280-320 nm), are receiving attention from biologists interested in how these changes will alter community and ecosystem struc? ture and function. However, we know little about how factors such as UV-B affect ani? mals physiologically. Amphibians provide a good model system for examining the physi? ological effects of UV-B exposure because basic studies documenting both lethal and sublethal effects have been completed on a wide array of species at many life history stages. In this study, we examined the physi? ological stress response, as measured by glucocorticoid hormones, and survival of Cascades frog tadpoles, Rana cascadae, exposed to ambient UV-B in the field for 6 weeks. There were no differences in corti? costerone levels between exposed and non-exposed tadpoles, although survival was significantly higher in the tadpoles shielded from UV-B. Even though UV-B ex? posure can be lethal for Rana cascadae tad? poles, in this study we did not observe a physiological stress response. However, the stress response in this species is poorly un? derstood and there are several factors, in? cluding the length of the study, the ability of tadpoles to perceive UV-B, and the timing of development of the stress axis, that could explain the lack of a physiological stress re? sponse.

G. groenlandica caterpillars overwinter in hibernacula anchored at the base of rocks on the Arctic tundra. At each of two study sites on Ellesmere Island, hibernacula were consistently found on the same aspect of the rocks, possibly related to prevailing winds and/or patterns of snow accumulation.

Along a 0-25?C temperature gra? dient, most caterpillars settled at the warm- est region (21 -25?C), indicating that they may select hibernacula sites based on thermal cues. However they do not appear to select colder microhabitats, as we had hypoth- esized, as a means of metabolic depression for energy conservation in late sumer and fail. Active caterpillars showed no prefer? ence based on soil moisture, however most caterpillars entering hibernation preferred low soil moisture (0-10%), which may be in? dicative of microhabitats where snow melts earliest in Spring. 11.5 BENNETT, VA.*, KUKAL, O, LEE, R.E., Miami Univeristy, Oxford, OH, Atlan? tic Low Temperature Systems, Ltd., Halifax, Nova Scotia, Miami University, Oxford, OH. Seasonal metabolic depression and mi? tochondrial degradation in Arctic woollybear caterpillars, Gynaephora groenlandica. Gynaephora groenlandica requires 7-14 years to complete its life cycle, overwinter- ing as many times. Because of the short ac? tive season (3-4 weeks in June), these cat? erpillars may spend as much as 90% of their lives in dormancy without feeding. Therefore energy conservation is especially important for their survival in this extreme environment. At the end of June, when the majority of arc? tic insects are just beginning their summer active period, G. groenlandica caterpillars enter hibernation, probably as a means of temporally avoiding parasitoids. Therefore, even in hibernation, G. groenlandica expe? rience the warmest summer temperatures in July and early August that could poten? tially elevate metabolic rate causing deple? tion of energy reserves. To conserve energy, G. groenlandica exhibit a seasonal meta? bolic depression associated with hiberna- tion: respiration rates of late-season cater? pillars were as much as 50% lower than those of active caterpillars, and they were relatively insensitive to temperature (Q10~1.5). A previous study demonstrated that cold-acclimated G. groenlandica had fewer mitochondria in brain and fat body tis? sues than warm-acclimated caterpillars. Could this mitochondrial degradation be the mechanism of metabolic depression? Us? ing confocal microscopy and digital image analysis, mitochondria were quantified in tis? sues of both active and hibernating stages of G. groenlandica. Initial data show a 54% reduction in the number of mitochondria in fat body tissue of hibernating versus active caterpillars, and as much as a 65% reduc? tion in the number of mitochondria in muscle tissue. 54.5 BERNAL, D*, DICKSON, K, GRA?

This study documents the shortfin mako shark's (Isurus oxyrinchus) capacity to ther- moregulate and the thermal effects on meta? bolic enzymes activities and compares the results to tunas. Elasmobranchs and bony fishes have evolved independently for more than 400 million years. However, two Re? cent groups, the lamnid sharks and tunas, display remarkable similarities in features related to swimming performance. Traits separating these two groups from other fishes include a higher degree of body streamlining, a shift in position of the aero? bic locomotor muscle (red muscle, RM) that powers sustained swimming to an anterior position in the body and to near to the verte? bral column, an increased gill surface area, a higher blood oxygen carrying capacity, the capacity to conserve metabolic heat (i.e., endothermy), and greater muscle aerobic and anaerobic enzyme activities at in vivo temperatures. The suite of morphological, physiological, and biochemical specializa? tions that define "high-performance fishes" have been extensively characterized in the tunas. This study uses the convergent fea- 942 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Speed, step length and frequency in human walk? ing: evaluating the optimization criteria. Locomotion is an active process that in? volves an interaction between physiologi? cal and physical features of an organism. The result of this interaction is the overt func? tional behavior of the system, its capabilities and limitations. But can the physiological and physical influences be discriminated? We use the walking human as a model sys? tem to investigate the factors influencing gait pattern, as indicated by the selection of step length and frequency to provide walking speed. We hypothesize that the selection of these variables depends on the minimiza- tion of the locomotory cost function under the explicit circumstances involved, i.e. the solution is a constrained optimization. We compare walking behavior of 6 male and 6 female subjects with predictions based on individual locomotion cost. The results verify the basic model, but also demonstrate that other factors influence the outcome as well. 50.3 BETTENCOURT, B.R. *, FEDER, M.E., University of Chicago. Concerted evolution and concerted degeneration at the hsp70 genes and pseudogenes of the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup. To determine how the hsp70 genes (4-5 copies total, at two chromosomal loci) co- evolved with the diversification of the D. melanogaster species subgroup, we se? quenced multiple alleles of each gene in representative species. The hsp70 genes display strikingly different patterns of molecu? lar evolution among the eight species of the subgroup. In D. simulans and D. melanogaster, frequent gene conversion ho- mogenizes all the hsp70 coding sequences, diversifies flanking sequences, and interacts with both purifying and balancing selection to drive rapid concerted evolution. By con? trast, hsp70 pseudogenes are common in D. mauritiana: null alleles of three of the four hsp70 genes are at high frequency. These pseudogenes also participate in gene con? version; copies at different loci share the same degenerative mutations. The hsp70 genes of D. orena, basal member of the sub? group, evolve in a fashion similar to those of D. simulans. While hsp70 expression level, thermotolerance, and thermal niche breadth are strongly coupled to the hsp70 genes in D. melanogaster, the functional copy num? ber and relative "health" of the hsp70 ge? nome is only a fair predictor of these traits in other species. If, when, and how natural se? lection acts on the hsp70 genes varies in a lineage- and locus-specific fashion.

The predatory legs of Philonthus marginatus (Coleoptera,Staphylinidae): functional morphology and tarsal ultrastructure. Within the Coleoptera, no predatory legs have become known thus far. However, within the staphylinid genus Philonthus represen- tatives of the subgenus Onychophilonthus are distinct from other subgenera by the structure of their prolegs: both sexes have elongated coxae and enlarged tarsomeres l-IV. The claws can be bent downward to a large extent, thus almost setting against the ventral side of tarsomere V. We present the results of (a) behavioural observations con? cerning predatory performance, (b) motion analysis of the predatory strike, and (c) mor? phological examinations of the prolegs by light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy.

The mean total dura? tion of the strike from the onset of the proleg till the first prey contact amounts to 31.6 ms. The movements of the prolegs during the strike can be subdivided in three compo? nents: (1) upward swing, (2) downward strike, (3) withdrawal. The structure of the coxo-tro- chanteral articulation and the high speed of the downward strike (7 ms) suggest a pre- stress mechanism, consisting of the co-con- traction of the trochanterofemoral flexor and levator muscles. In addition, a coxal projec? tion that fits into a trochanteral groove when the leg is flexed, serves as a cuticular sup? porting structure. The ultrastructure of the protarsi l-lll demonstrates the rich develop? ment of epidermal glands, which probably produce an adhesive secretion. By this means, under mediation of tarsal adhesive setae, the prey can be fixed at the moment of contact, thus enabling the beetles to cap? ture even fast-fleeing prey such as spring- tails. 23.6 BIRCH,JM*, DICKINSON, M.H, Uni? versity of California, Berkeley. Dynamic stall of a flapping appendage in the absence of a spiral vortex. Recent studies of insect flight describe how dynamic stall and the formation of a leading edge vortex generate large lift forces for insects. This leading edge vortex, along with forces generated through rotation and wake capture, accounts for all lift necessary for insects to fly. This vortex is present throughout the translation portion of the wingbeat cycle and has been shown to grow in size from the base toward the wing tip. It has been hypothesized that fluid spirals out- ward through the center of this vortex, drain? ing energy from the core, allowing the vor? tex to remain stable throughout the stroke. Using a robotic flapping model of a Droso? phila wing, we visualized the flow of fluid around the wing and reconstructed the flow structure using digital particle image velicometry. At mid-downstroke, the leading edge vortex consists of a large sheet of vor- ticity that stretches back from the leading to trailing edges of the wing. However, unlike the flow pattern seen in the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, flow within the leading edge vortex was &lt; 5% of wing tip velocity. We tested the idea that this axial flow was nec? essary to maintain the stability of the lead- ing-edge vortex. Using both a wall that cir? cumscribed the wing sweep as well as fences on the wing, we inhibited axial flow through the vortex core. When axial flow was not permitted off the wingtip (the wall case), the tip vortex detached from the wing more distally and forces generated by the wing increased by at least 14%. Fences had little effect on force generation. From these experiments we hypothesize that in Droso? phila, axial flow has little effect on the stabil? ity of the leading edge vortex, and thus its size is not the limiting factor when determin? ing the performance of a flapping append? age.

Embryos of the Procellariiformes are noted for their very long incubation times. The limited data available on embryos from this group indicates that these long devel? opment times are associated with increased costs of development. We measured the oxygen consumption rate of developing embryos of the fairy prion (Pachyptila turtut), a small procellariiform, from early in incuba? tion until internal pipping (IP) occurred. Av? erage egg mass in this species was 25g. The oxygen consumption rate showed an exponential rise with time. There appeared to be a short plateau period two days prior to IP which occurred on day 42 of an esti? mated incubation time of 44.5 days. The pre- IP oxygen consumption rate averaged 238 ml OJd. Integration of the area under the curve to the time of IP gave a total of 2924 ml 02 consumed, a pre-IP cost of development of about 57.4 kJ. The incubation time of the fairy prion is 188% of the value predicted from existing allometric equations. The pre- IP energy consumption was not significantly different from predicted values. The cost of development was increased (184% of pre- 944 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="21">dicted values) as previously observed in this group.

Mate choice in prairie voles: effects of genetic related- ness and familiarity. Prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster, are monogamous rodents. We examined the mating choices of sexually inexperienced male and female prairie voles in two-way choice tests under 3 different conditions. Subjects were tested with targets that were 1) either a familiar sibling or an unrelated and unfamiliar vole; 2) a sibling and an un? related vole, both of which were unfamiliar; or 3) two siblings, where one was familiar and the other unfamiliar. Intrommission was the criterion for mating. In condition 1, all voles that mated did so with the unfamiliar and unrelated conspecific. In condition 2, there was no significant preferences be? tween the two targets. In condition 3, only one of 17 subjects mated, suggesting that voles avoid mating with siblings even when they are unfamiliar to the subject. The re? sults of other measures related to reproduc? tive behavior (e.g., time visiting, anogenital investigation, time in contact, agonistic in- teractions) will also be reported. In most cases these measures were consistent with the mating preferences. However, we also found that interaction of pairs that mated were significantly more agonistic as com? pared to those of pairs that did not mate. Additionally, social preference (time spent visiting a target) did not always correspond to mating preference. We conclude that both relatedness and familiarity are important in the mate choices of prairie voles and that time spent visiting is not an adequate mea? sure of mating preferences.

The extraembryonic membranes of am? niote eggs serve vital nutritional and respi? ratory functions throughout development. However, very little is known about the struc? ture and function of these membranes in oviparous reptiles. We examined extraem? bryonic membranes of the corn snake Elaphe guttata (Colubridae), using resin - embedded tissues sectioned on glass knives. Following oviposition, the embryos develop a chorioallantois as well an omphalallantoic membrane. The chorioal? lantois is highly vascularized, and its capil? laries are separated from the inner lining of the eggshell by a bilayered epithelium that progressively thins during development. Small basophilic granules, possibly taken up from the eggshell, accumulate in apices of the epithelial cells. Depletion of yolk leads to expansion of the chorioallantois at the expense of the yolk sac. The omphalallantoic membrane forms through penetration of the allantois into the yolk cleft. The isolated yolk mass (IYM) undergoes progressive reduc? tion, transforming into isolated patches of yolk droplets that are underlain and sur- rounded by the allantois. Yolk of the IYM ap? pears to be digested by the bilaminar omphalopleure as well as by the allantois and motile cells with phagocytic capabili? ties. Diminution of the IYM and the overlying epithelium lead to close approximation of the allantoic capillaries to the eggshell throughout the abembryonic hemisphere of 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Redox chemistry, involving the transfer of electrons and hydrogen atoms, is central to energy conversion in respiration, and control of gene expression by redox state commonly occurs in bacteria, allowing rapid response to environmental changes. Colo? nial hydroids often encrust surfaces over which the food supply varies in time and space; hence, in these organisms redox con? trol of the development of feeding structures (polyps) and gastrovascular connections (stolons) could be similarly adaptive, allow? ing colonies to adjust the timing and spac- ing of these structures in response to a vari? able food supply. Feeding triggers strong contractions of polyp epitheliomuscular cells, resulting in high rates of gastrovascular flow. In fed polyps, this metabolic demand shifts the redox state of these cells in the direction of oxidation and diminishes the rate of for? mation of mitochondrial ROS. On the other hand, after 24 h without food, polyp epitheliomuscular cells become quiescent, redox state shifts in the direction of reduc? tion, and formation of mitochondrial ROS increases. Perturbations of redox state and ROS can also be initiated using uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and inhibitors of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The effects on colony pattern formation are similar; relative oxidation results in high rates of polyp and stolon tip initiation, while rela? tive reduction results in low rates. As in other systems, ROS may mediate the effects of redox state; high levels of ROS may sup? press the gene activity that leads to polyp and stolon tip initiation, while low levels of ROS may be permissive in this regard. In this way, metabolic demand, redox state, and ROS may interact to control pattern forma- tion in hydroid colonies and to allow adap? tive growth forms in response to the food supply and other environmental factors. 55.3 BLANK, J.M.*, DAVIE, P.S., MORRISSETTE, JM, BLOCK, B.A., Stanford University, Pacific Grove, CA, Massey Uni? versity, Palmerston North, New Zealand, Stanford University Pacific Grove, CA, Stanford University, Pacific Grove, CA. Ef? fects of temperature on cardiac performance in yellowfin tuna. Tunas are remarkable among teleosts for their endothermy, high metabolic rates and high capacity for exercise. While tunas warm their swimming muscles and viscera, their hearts are thought to remain near am? bient temperature. This raises the possibility that cold water may impair cardiac perfor? mance in vivo, limiting the scope for metabo? lism of tuna in the wild. We have investigated the effects of acute temperature change on cardiac function in yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) using an in situ perfused heart preparation. We found that as temperature was reduced, heart rate fell but stroke vol? ume increased. Heart rate exhibited a Q10 of -2.0 between 15/C and 25/C while stroke volume showed a Q10 of ?0.5 over the same range. Cardiac output was 15-30% lower at 15/C than at 20/C or 25/C. Maxi? mal output pressure attainable without flow compromise remained nearly constant at 12 kPa over this temperature range. This reduc? tion in cardiac performance with decreasing temperature suggests that cold water may reduce blood flow and hence oxygen deliv? ery in wild yellowfin tuna. 4.5 BLOB, R.W.*, PACE, C.M., WESTNEAT, M.W, Field Museum, Chicago, IL.

Kinematic distinc- tions between the species indicate that aquatic specialization need not impede ter? restrial locomotion. For instance, in both swimming and walking, femoral excursion is nearly twice as great in softshells (70-75/) as in sliders (35-40/). However, in softshells the knee is held significantly straighter dur? ing walking than during swimming, suggest? ing that softshell knee extensors may oper? ate at shorter lengths less optimal for force generation during walking. Motor patterns of softshells and sliders also show several differences; however, the modulation of mo? tor patterns between swimming and walk? ing is similar in both species. In both sliders and softshells, the knee extensor femorotibialis shows a second burst during walking that correlates with a protractive phase of knee extension. In addition, the timing of femoral protractor activity does not change significantly between swimming and walking in either species. Together, our analy? ses of hindlimb kinematics and muscle ac? tivity in these species suggest that measure? ments of muscle length changes may indi? cate key distinctions in how habitat special? ists and generalists modulate muscle func? tion between behaviors.

Elevated carbon dioxide concentra? tions inhibit nitrate assimilation in wheat shoots. Fluxes of C02 and 02 from the shoots of wheat (Triticum aestivum) demonstrated that exposure to elevated C02 concentrations strongly inhibited shoot N03 assimilation. Accordingly, elevated C02 concentrations enhanced shoot growth of wheat plants re? ceiving N03 nutrition to only half the extent of plants receiving NH4+ nutrition, and el? evated HC03 concentrations interfered with the translocation of NO-- into wheat and pea chloroplasts. If C02 inhibition of N03 assimi? lation were common among species, it would provide a mechanistic explanation for several responses of plants to elevated C02 including photosynthetic acclimation to C02, C02 inhibition of respiration, and intraspe? cific and interspecific variation in plant growth under elevated C02. 54.4 BOETTGER, S.A. *, MCCLINTOCK, J.B., University of Alabama at Birmingham. The ef? fects of organic and inorganic phosphate on muscle contraction and acetyl cholinesterase activity of the nearshore echinoid Lytechinus variegatus. Lytechinus variegatus is a common nearshore sea urchin that is exposed to phosphate pollutants. Sea urchins were col? lected in April, 2000 from Saint Joseph's Bay in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Individuals were divided into a control (artificial sea water), sea water containing three concen? trations of inorganic (sodium phosphate); or three concentrations of organic (triethyl phos? phate) phosphate. Individuals were main? tained for an 8-week period, dissected and the Aristotle's lantern retractor muscles ex? tracted individually. Each muscle was at? tached to a strain gage, stimulated electri? cally, and muscle contractions (g force/mm muscle length) recorded. When compared to the control group, force of contraction in? creased significantly in individuals main? tained in increasing concentrations of both phosphates. Following the direct coloring thiocholine assay, acetyl cholinesterase ac? tivity was assessed by embedding and stain? ing retractor muscles from the Aristotle's lan? tern, tube-feet, and gut, and counting the oc? currence of fully-stained motor endplates/ mm2. Acetyl cholinesterase activity in these same muscles was also assessed through a colorimetric assay. The number of fully- stained motor endplates and the enzymatic activity of acetyl cholinesterase decreased in individuals maintained in increasing con? centrations of organic phosphate when com? pared to the control group. No change oc? curred in individuals exposed to inorganic phosphate.

In response to cold temperature expo? sure, the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) undergoes an increase in metabolic rate concomitant with an increase in core temperature above thermoneutral values. This physiological response is incom? patible with standard models of the control of body temperature in non-hibemating mammals where a negative feedback sys? tem inhibits heat production if core tempera? ture rises above the setpoint. One possible explanation for this cold-induced hyperther? mia is that resting armadillos are slightly tor? pid and that cold exposure causes the ani? mals to arouse and increase their core tem? perature to a higher setpoint in order to in? crease metabolic heat production capacity. We tested this hypothesis by exposing ar? madillos to cold temperatures while simul? taneously gas exchange rates (V02 and VC02) and core temperature at four loca? tions (rectal 8cm and 16cm; esophageal 8cm and 16cm). Core temperatures were highly correlated to each other and changed dur? ing cold exposure according to the same pattern, thus indicating that cold-induced hy? perthermia truly reflects a change in the in? ternal heat content of the animal rather than a decrease in the size of the core. Peak V02 occurred approximately at the same time as peak core temperatures, thus supporting the hypothesis that cold-induced hyperthermia favors high metabolic rates. Peak VC02 of? ten occurred well after the peak in core tem? peratures, when animals were hypothermic. This is likely the result of increased C02 excretion resulting from the buffering of lac? tate by bicarbonates rather than an increase in the rate of C02 production.

The impact of mitochondial thermal sensitivity on the swimming capacity of Arctic charr. The swimming performance of fish lies on there capacity to convert chemical en? ergy into mechanical energy, trough the con? traction of axial muscle. During sustained swimming, ATP required for contraction is mostly supplied by mitochondrial metabo? lism. Oxygen consumption is thus propor? tional to work intensity. At low temperature, the aerobic capacities of fish decrease, as well as maximal sustainable swimming speed. However, for many species cold ac? climation increases the aerobic capacity of muscle trough an increase of mitochondrial volume-density and/or of mitochondrial en? zymes concentration. This compensation suggest that swimming capacities impair? ment at low temperature is related to a de? crease in mitochondrial catalytic capacities. To test this hypothesis, the aerobic scope for activity of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) was measured at four different temperatures (1, 6, 12 and 18 C). In each fish, mitochon? dria were extracted from red muscle of one side of the fish. Mitochondrial respiration (pyruvate and malate as substrates) was measured under the same temperatures. Cy? tochrome c Oxidase activity was assayed in the mitochondrial preparation and in whole red muscle of the other side of the fish. This allowed us to estimate maximal mitochon? drial respiration rate in fish red muscle and compare it to aerobic scope for activity un? der different temperatures.

These differences are paralleled by relative hindlimb span (Bonine and Garland 1999, J Zool Lond 248:255-265). We examined the iliofibularis (IF) muscle to determine if fiber- type composition varies similarly. Sampling 11 species (44 indivs.), we used histochemi? cal assays for myosin ATPase (fast-twitch capacity) and succinic dehydrogenase (oxi? dative capacity) to classify fibers as fast- twitch glycolytic (FG), fast-twitch oxidative- glycolytic (FOG), or slow-twitch oxidative (SO). Sand lizards have a high proportion of FG fibers (mean 67%) and a low proportion of FOG (29%); horned lizards have lower FG (28%) and higher FOG (61%); members ofthe Sceloporus group, which are presumed to reflect the phrynosomatid ancestral state, are intermediate for both FG (45%) and FOG (44%). Across all 11 species, %FOG and %FG are strongly negatively correlated (r = - 0.95). Analysis with phylogenetically inde? pendent contrasts indicates that this relation? ship is entirely attributable to the divergence between sand and horned lizards. Neither the proportional area of the IF in the hindlimb, nor the cross-sectional areas of FG (11 spp. mean 417 Mprn2, s.e. adj. for body mass 13.8 [mean log body mass 1.0045]), FOG (260, 9.5), and SO (137,12.5) fibers, differ among the 3 subclades.

Changes in hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) content during environmentally-induced metamorphosis in the Western spadefoot toad (Spea hammondii) Western spadefoot toads (Spea hammondii) are desert dwelling amphibians whose tadpoles can accelerate metamor? phosis as their ponds dry, thereby escaping desiccation. Corticotropin-releasing hor? mone (CRH) may transduce the environmen? tal signal into an endocrine response that drives metamorphosis. To further understand the role that CRH plays in environmentally- induced metamorphosis we developed and validated a CRH radioimmunoassay (RIA) to monitor changes in hypothalamic CRH content following exposure to low water in the laboratory. We generated a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against synthetic Xe? nopus laevis CRH. This RIA detects verte? brate CRH peptides with high sensitivity and shows low cross-reactivity with the CRH-like peptides sauvagine, urotensin and urocortin. Molecular cloning of the S. hammondii CRH cDNA shows that the sequence of the ma? ture peptide is identical to the Xenopus se? quence. Thus, this RIA is homologous for both X. laevis and S. hammondii. We vali? dated the CRH RIA for measurement of pep? tide content in acid hypothalamic extracts. We demonstrate that CRH-binding protein (CRH-BP), which could potentially interfere with the RIA, is present in S. hammondiibra\n. However, very little biologically active CRH? BP remains after the acid extraction. Addi? tion of varying amounts of recombinant mouse CRH-BP to the standard curve in the RIA shows that, while the BP can interfere at higher concentrations, the amount remain? ing after acid extraction does not interfere with the CRH RIA. Using this RIA, we show that S. hammondii tadpoles exposed to low water level exhibit brain-region specific changes in CRH content.

Sexual selection for wing-sounds asso? ciated with convergent wing shape evolu? tion between three clades of manakins (Aves: Pipridae). Males of most of the -40 species of Neo? tropical manakins (Aves: Pipridae) perform energetic courtship displays on lek territo? ries. In nearly half of the speices, males pro? duce mechanical wing sounds during these displays. Recent phylogenetic hypotheses indicate wing sound production may have evolved as many as three times indepen? dently in the family. Repeated evolution of mechanical sounds allows comparative analysis of wing morphology in relation to sound production. Specifically, this research addresses (1) if wing shape has been detectably modified in the mechanical sound producing lineages, and (2) if so, are there any commonalities in shape change be? tween lineages. I measured the lengths and widths of 4 wing bones for 42 species of manakins and allies, including representa- tives from each of the three mechanical sound producing clades. Three measures of overall body size were also made. Wing shape was characterized by the second prin? ciple component of a PCA, and mechanical sounds were categorized according to com? plexity, loudness, and repertoire sizes of species. Independent contrast of species values of these variables were regressed to show that wing shape has changed convergently in mechanical sound produc? ing lineages. Wings of mechanical sound producing clades have shorter, thicker ulna, shorter carpometacarpi, and thicker scapula blades then non-mechanical sound produc? ing manakins. These result support the hy? pothesis that sexual selection has caused wing morphology to evolve in response to functional requirements for mechanical sound production.

Alterations of protein expression may be important in determining the capacity of an organism to tolerate low oxygen con? centrations. Most previous studies of fish exposed to hypoxia have examined changes in individual proteins. Here, we report on the use of two-dimensional elec? trophoresis (2DE) to investigate the effects of hypoxia on patterns of global protein expression in the zebrafish, Danio rerio. Zebrafish were held for 48 h in water hav? ing a dissolved oxygen concentration of 10% of the air-saturated value, a treatment known to increase the survival time of zebrafish during more severe hypoxia. Proteins from white muscle were solubi? lized, separated by 2DE, and stained with silver. Among the proteins resolved was a relatively prominent 50 kDa polypeptide that appeared to have at least 2 isoforms differing in isoelectric point (pl). The rela? tive abundance of the 2 forms was altered by hypoxia, with the more basic form pre- dominating in extracts prepared from hy? poxic fish. This change in pl is consistent with post-translational modification, per? haps dephosphorylation, of the protein during hypoxia. The polypeptide is similar in size and pl to mammalian pyruvate ki? nase (PK), an enzyme known to be regu? lated by reversible phosphorylation. A change in phosphorylation state of zebrafish PK during hypoxia could result in a more active enzyme at physiological substrate concentrations and contribute to an increased capacity for glycolytic ATP generation during hypoxia.

Migratory shorebirds on staging areas typically concentrate their feeding on unusu- ally abundant prey species, enabling them to rapidly increase mass prior to the next leg of their migration. Delaware Bay is the most important staging area on the Atlantic coast 950 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="27">of North America for shorebirds during their Spring (northward) migration; here, birds primarily feed upon horseshoe crab eggs on sandy intertidal beaches. The commer? cial fishery for horseshoe crabs, which col- lects the animals for bait in eel and whelk traps, expanded substantially from about 1990 to 1996. Based on surveys of six Dela? ware Bay, NJ beaches, horseshoe crab egg abundance has decreased in conjunction with the expansion of this fishery. During the period 1985-1991, relatively few surface sediment samples (0 to 5 cm depth) con? tained zero horseshoe crab eggs, and at least 30% of these samples contained &gt;10,000 eggs per square meter. In contrast, in the period 1996-1999, the frequency dis? tribution is strongly shifted toward the lower egg density intervals. The likelihood of a shorebird encountering surface sediments with zero eggs has increased from about 10% in 1985 to over 50% in 1999. These trends in egg density are also corroborated by significant decreases in the abundance of stranded horseshoe crabs over the pe? riod 1978-1999. Shorebirds in Delaware Bay may be adversely impacted by further de? creases in the horseshoe crab resource, by extending foraging time and/or intensifying intra- and interspecific competition for eggs.

The presence of hormones in yolks of freshly laid eggs has recently been described in reptiles. These hormones are probably of maternal origin. Their potential to influence offspring sex may be enhanced by tempera? ture-dependent sex determination. Profiles of circulating hormones have been de? scribed for several temperate turtles. There appears to be a general pattern to the sea? sonal oscillations in testosterone (T), proges? terone (P), and estradiol (E2). To determine whether this pattern is represented in egg yolks, we measured T, P, and E2 concentra? tions via radioimmunoassay in three layers of yolk from eggs of early and late nesting female painted turtles (Chrysemys picta). Also, we extracted small yolk biopsies to measure T and E2. We compared the hor? mone concentrations from the biopsied eggs to the sex ratio of their clutchmates to deter? mine whether maternally-derived yolk hor? mones influence offspringsex. T and P con? centrations were highest in the exterior layer of yolks and E2 concentrations were Iowest. The same layered pattern of hormones oc? curred in red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans).Yo\k E2 concentrations var? ied seasonally in painted turtles, with low levels in all yolk layers early in the nesting season and higher levels in all layers later on. Neither T nor P exhibited significant sea? sonal variation. In the yolk biopsies, there also was seasonal variation in E2, but not in T. We found a significant correlation with sex ratio for E2, but not forT. 6.5 BOYLE, HJ * GRAHAM, J.B., Univer? sity of California, San Diego. Acquisition of characters facilitating amphibious behavior in the oxudercine fishes. The evolutionary sequence of character acquisition associated with amphibious air breathing and terrestrial life was examined in the oxudercine fishes (Gobiidae). Included among the 10 genera (35 species) of oxudercines are forms with little to no spe? cializations for amphibious life as well as the four genera (25 species) of the amphibi? ous, air-breathing mudskipper clade. Five characters hypothesized to be associated with amphibious life (presence of a flattened eye lens, reduced gill surface area to mass ratio, increased buccal chamber volume to mass ratio, inability to repay an oxygen debt in water after exercise, and presence of an air phase inside the burrow) are expressed in one mudskipper species, Periophthal- modon schlosseri. Mapping of the character states of six genera (Oxuderces, Pseud- apocryptes, Scartelaos, Boleophthalmus, Periophthalmus, and Periophthalmodori) onto a cladogram generated using morpho? logical data indicates the following evolu? tionary sequence for the transition from an exclusively aquatic existence to amphibious life: deposition of air inside the burrow, in? creased buccal chamber volume to mass ratio, decreased gill surface area to mass 800-955-1236 ?

The discontinuous gas exchange cycle (DGC) in insects, consists of a closed phase (C) during which the spiracular valves at the openings of the tracheae are closed, a flut- ter phase (F) when the spiracles open and close rapidly, and an open phase (O) in which the spiracles are open, allowing the free exchange of respiratory gases between the tracheal lumen and the outside air. Early workers such as Buck and Levy &amp; Schneiderman, suggested that the DGC serves to reduce respiratory water loss. More recently, Lighton has suggested that the DGC serves to increase internal carbon dioxide concentrations, thereby facilitating the release of carbon dioxide into environ? ments, such as underground burrows, which are rich in this gas. We have been conduct- ing studies using the Hemipteran Rhodnius prolixus, an insect that takes a bloodmeal up to ten times its previous body volume. ln the days following feeding, the insect re? mains completely still, yet its metabolic rate increases up to 14-fold. We have been us? ing this unusual behavior to examine the effects of metabolic rate on the DGC. We found that the spiracles appear to close very tightly when metabolic rates are low, but do not close fully when the rates are higher. We will present data from other laboratories that demonstrate similar effects when metabolic rate is varied by temperature or when oxy? gen tensions are manipulated. I propose that the DGC may serve to reduce the sup? ply of oxygen to the tissues during periods of low metabolic rate. Oxygen is toxic to cells, even at ambient concentrations, and insects may use the DGC to provide adequate gas exchange while reducing oxidative damage to tissues during periods of reduced oxygen demand.

We investigated the mechanism of lung ventilation in an aquatic salamander, Amphiuma tridactylum. Breathing epi- sodes, which occur at intervals ranging from less than 1 to 50 min, are character? ized by a single large exhalation followed immediately by a variable number of buc? cal pumps which refill the lungs. Unlike the majority of salamanders which use a two-stroke buccal pump, Amphiuma uses a four-stroke buccal pump. Four-stroke breathing is also found in another aquatic salmander (Cryptobranchus), in an aquatic frog (Xenopus), and in basal ray- finned fishes (eg. Amia and Lepisosteus), and probably evolved independently in all of these taxa. In Amphiuma, the combina? tion of relatively large tidal volumes and a four-stroke buccal pump results in highly effective exchange of pulmonary gases with the environment. Electromyography of the M. transversus abdominis (TA), ab? dominal pressure measurements and blow-hoie pneumotachography indicate that both passive and active mechanisms contribute to exhalation. Exhalation gen? erally begins in the absence of abdominal muscle activity. This "passive" phase of exhalation may be driven by tissue elas? ticity, hydrostatic pressure, and/or smooth muscle contraction in the lungs. In most breaths, the passive phase is followed by an active phase in which an increase in pleuroperitoneal pressure, powered by ac? tivity in the TA, joins the passive exhala? tion mechanisms. The use of hypaxial mucles to power active exhalation has now been found in five salamander families (Sirenidae, Cryptobranchidae, Proteidae, Ambystomatidae, and Amphiumidae), pro? viding evidence that aspiration breathing in amniotes may have evolved in two stages: first active exhalation only and sub? sequently the addition of active inhalation. 952 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

We used flow cytometry to measure ge? nome size (pg of DNA per diploid cell) in 15 species belonging to 7 tetraodontiform families and subfamilies. Previous work? ers have found that members of Tetraodontidae (smooth puffers) have the smallest genome size of any vertebrate measured to date (0.8 pg vs. a mean of 2.0 pg for all teleosts). We found that this tiny genome is present in members of both tetraodontid subfamilies indicating that the primitive condition for Tetraodontidae was a genome size of 0.8n0.9 pg. In contrast, Diodontidae (spiny puffers, sister group to Tetraodontidae), possess a genome which is about two times larger (1.60 pg). Mola mola, a member of the sister group to Diodontidae+Tetraodontidae, also does not have a particularly small genome (1.70 pg). The most parsimonious expla? nation for this pattern is that the primitive condition for Molidae+ (Diodontidae+ Tetraodontidae) is a genome size of 1.60n1.70 pg, indicating that the tiny ge? nome size of smooth puffers is a derived character unique to tetraodontids. Previ? ous workers have proposed that the loss of anatomical parts in puffers (no ribs, no pelvis, few vertebrae) might be related to the loss of genetic material in these fishes. Our results do not support this hypothesis because molids and diodontids are miss? ing just as many bits and pieces as smooth puffers, yet they do not have particularly small genomes. We propose that the smooth puffers are a good model system in which to study the evolutionary mecha? nisms of genome size reduction because: (1) they have an exceptionally small ge? nome; (2) their closest outgroups have much larger genomes; and (3) a smoothpuffer, Fugu rubripes, is being used as a model organism for gene identifica? tion and molecular tools emerging from this work will be useful in studies of ge? nome size evolution in these fishes. 28.1 BRAMBLE, DM *, UEBERMAN, DE, DALEY, M.A., Universityof Utah, Salt Lake City, George Wash.

Adequate head-neck stabilization ought to be vital to any running mammal but the phenomenon has been little studied. We investigated the mechanical basis of cranio- cervical stability in humans during treadmill walking and running. Quantitative measures of head-neck and arm motion were obtained from high-speed videography as well as surface mounted accelerometers. Corre? sponding activity patterns in the trapezius and biceps muscles were also monitored. Our findings show that the mechanical inter? actions between the head-neck complex and arms are strikingly different in the walk and run regardless of speed. The timing of trapezius muscle activity relative to the step cycle differs in the two gaits (i.e., initiated at midstance in walking vs. heelstrike when running). During running the mass of the arms appears to be coupled to the cranio- cervical complex through the superior trapezii and the associated nuchal ligament. Indeed, the combined kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic profiles suggest a bio? mechanical model in which the momentum of the runneris arms is used to counteract the tendency of the head and neck to pitch forward at each footstrike. The same, gait- specific, mechanical linkage may also help to reduce impulsive loading of the head when running (as compared to fast walk? ing). Analyses of occipital morphology in Recent and fossil crania suggest that this novel mechanism, in which the nuchal liga? ment is a key player, may be unique among hominoids to the genus Homo, thus provid? ing evidence of specialization for running late in human evolution.

The "hotshot hypothesis" states that males congregate around a male that has certain traits that make him more preferred by females during mate selection. In aggre- gating around the favored male, other males increase their own chances of mating. Dur? ing the mating season, prairie mole cricket males build specialized burrows from which they project their mating call into the air. Fe? males flying in the area hear the mating calls and drop to ground level, entering the bur? rows of males of their choice. Since a male's call is the only thing a female can use in selecting a mate, different aspects of the male's mating song were analyzed in order to pinpoint a preferred trait. One trait that attracted other males to congregate around a "hotshot" male was the amplitude of a male's call. It was observed that males with the loudest call on a particular night would entice other males to their positions to con- struct their own burrows the following night or the next night that calling occurred. These data support the "hotshot hypothesis" as the reason for lekking in Gryllotalpa major. SB.UBREUNER, C W*, HAHN, T P, Ari? zona State University, University of Alaska Fairbanks. Corticosterone and inclement weather: mechanisms underlying adaptive behavioral responses in mountain birds. In seasonally-breeding migratory birds, the drive to arrive early and establish a terri? tory on the breeding grounds carries with it the potential benefit of improved reproduc? tive success, but also the risk of encounter? ing potentially life-threatening inclement weather. This is particularly true in species breeding at high elevations or high latitudes. Storms can reduce food availability, limit for? aging opportunities, and impose increased thermoregulatory costs. Individuals' repro? ductive success can thus depend on how effectively they assess risks, and then modify behavior. In the High Sierra of California, mountain white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys oriantha) typically reach sub-alpine breeding areas in early May, when storms are common. Over the past 6 years, we have shown that when storm conditions become extreme, Z. I. oriantha typically abandon their territories and fly sev? eral kilometers to lower elevation, where con? ditions are milder and food is more abun? dant. Variation in internal reserves and/or food availability at the breeding site may modify the timing and duration of territory abandonment. We have evidence that cor? ticosterone acts as an endocrine mediator between the environment and behavior dur? ing inclement weather. This system is prov- ing ideal for studying the endocrine mecha? nisms that coordinate dramatic shifts in be? havior in response to both external and in? ternal factors. We have developed a work? ing model of how several of these factors (weather, food availability, energy reserves, and corticosterone) interact to affect behav? ioral decisions.

Spirochetes are major members of the termite gut microbiota, accounting for up to 50% of all the prokaryotes present. However, our understanding of them has been mea- ger, as none had ever been isolated in pure culture since first being observed in termite guts over a century ago. By analyzing SSU rDNA clones (obtained after PCR amplifica? tion from termite gut DNA), we and others have found that termite gut spirochetes rep? resent novel treponemes. As many as 26 new and different species of Treponema were detected in guts of various individual termite species, implying that earth's termites constitute a rich reservoir of novel spirochetal diversity. Physiological properties that en- able spirochetes to assume such abun? dance in termite guts are not yet clear, but probable roles for spirochetes in termite nu? trition are now beginning to emerge from studies of the first pure cultures recently iso? lated in our laboratory [J.

Computed tomographic (CT) technology has become a standard method for nondestructively accessing the interior struc? tures of irreplaceable fossils. This vastly in? creases the informative power of fossils and allows researchers a unique opportunity to visualize internal features in three dimen? sions, either through three-dimensional re? construction or as animations of sequential slices. Either mode (2-D or 3-D) can bring new insight into the study of fossil organism morphology, whether the focus is phylogenetics, functional morphology, physi? ology, or any other research program. There are additional practical applications of CT imagery to fossil preparation and the tracing of post-collection human modification. CT imagery improves the researcher's ability to illustrate complex internal structures, both to the research community and the general public. The data can be published in its na? tive digital format, either over the World Wide Web or through media such as CD-ROM or DVD, effectively allowing the dissemination of 'Virtual specimens". Simple software ap? plications allow colleagues, teachers, and students to interact with the data. Digital anatomical atlases can be generated for a broad diversity of taxa, which gives instruc- tors and students a larger sample of avail? able study specimens. One such atlas has already been made available for Alligator mississippiensis. Application of CT imag? ery to popularly-known taxa, as was recently done with Tyrannosaurus rex, gives re- searchers a new means of making impor? tant morphological and evolutionary points to the general public. Nonavian dinosaurs are inherently interesting to people, and a host of evolutionary questions, from the anatomy of pneumatic structures in the skull to origin of birds, can be addressed through a combination of careful phylogenetic analy? sis and CT imagery.

Ontogenetic changes in rates of water loss and shell-wearing be? haviors enable land hermit crab megalopae to avoid desiccating in air. The land hermit crab, Coenobita compressus, migrates from sea to land dur? ing the megalopal stage of postlarval devel? opment. As the megalopa emerges onto land, it encounters a physical environment wholly different from that of the sea. I investi? gated changes in C. compressusf behavior and physiology that enable it to avoid desic? cation on land. In one experiment, I exam? ined changes in rates of water loss before, during, and after megalopae were able to settle on land to determine if their resistance to desiccation improved over time. I found that megalopae became increasingly resis? tant to desiccation with age. In the second experiment, I exposed megalopae with and without snail shells to relative humidities of 100, 92, 85, and 76 % to determine if the shell would increase survival in the lower humidity environments. Megalopae wearing shells were far more likely to survive the two Iowest humidities compared to their naked counterparts.Thus, behavioral and morpho? logical enhancements to desiccation resis? tance facilitate the land hermit crabfs transi? tion to land.

Over dis? tances of a few decimeters, sand conducts low velocity (-50 m/sec) surface (Rayleigh) waves of sufficient amplitude and bandwidth (fmax -350 Hz) to be biologically detectable. Eight acceleration-sensitive receptors (slit sensilla) at the tips of the scorpion's circu- larly arranged legs detect surface vibrations generated by prey movements or 'juddering' signals from other scorpions. From this in? put alone, target direction is accurately cal? culated up to 20 cm distance. By ablating slit sensilla in various combinations on the eight legs, the contribution each makes in computing target location can be assessed. Other behavioral experiments show that dif? ferential timing of surface wave arrival at each sensor, and not relative amplitude of stimulation, is the cue that determines target location. A computational theory to account for wave source localization has been de? veloped using a population of second-or- der neurons, each receiving excitatory input from one sensor and inhibition from a triad of sensors opposite to it in a circular, eight- element array. Input from a passing surface wave opens a time window whose width de? termines the firing probability of second-or- der neurons. Stochastic resonance (optimi? zation) tunes the relative strengths of excita? tory and inhibitory inputs to second-order neurons, and target direction is encoded as the relative excitation of cells within the popu? lation. The excellent agreement between theory and behavioral observations confirms the mechanistic simplicity of the sand scorpion's sensory system for computational mapping of vibration source location.

We have studied non-photosynthetic plants in the Monotropoideae and Orchidaceae that obtain their fixed carbon from surrounding photosynthetic plants through shared ectomycorrhizal fungi. These "epiparasites" are only indirectly connected to surrounding trees, which are the ultimate source of their carbon; their proximal hosts are fungi that are mutualistically associated with the trees. We found that all epiparasitic plants have specific fungal associations, which in somecases exhibit geographic mo? saic patterns. In two species, Sarcodes sanguinea and Pterospora andromedea, seed germination is stimulated by diffusible compounds from the fungi associated with the adult plants, but not by distantly related fungi. Thus, the first step in establishment of these specific interactions is based on a spe? cific plant reaction to the presence of its fun? gal host. This fact, coupled with localized seed dispersal, has parallels with insect host-fidelity systems and may facilitate host- race formation, which we now have evidence for in Corallorhiza species. In nature, S. sanguinea appears to increase the presence of its host fungus, Rhizopogon ellenae, and the abundance of Abies magnificaroots to which the latter is associated. This either provides an unusual case of parasite-in- duced host-hypertrophy, or alternatively it suggests an unexpected mutualistic aspect to this symbiosis. S2.4 BRYANT, S. V, University of California. Regeneration: something old; something new. Urodeles are unique among verte? brates in their ability to regenerate lost ap? pendages as adults. Evidence from numer? ous studies indicates that regeneration is a biphasic process, with the first phase involving the transition to a blastema, and the second involving the control of growth and pattern formation within the regenera? tion blastema. Patterns of gene expression in the first phase mark it as unique and distinct from limb development. In the sec? ond phase, patterns of gene expression and tests of gene function, suggest mecha? nisms that are common to both develop? ment and regeneration. It is the genes ex? pressed during the early, unique phase that transform differentiated limb cells into a blastema with similar properties to that of an embryonic limb bud, thereby making regeneration possible.

Changes in energy utilization, food pro? cessing, and gastrointestinal morphology of voles under differing environmental condi? tions. Meadow voles (Microtus penn- sylvanicus) are small herbivores that are active year-round, yet have no capacity for torpor. Their food supply, though abun? dant, may be of low quality when plants undergo winter senescence. Therefore, they must adjust their food intake rate and/ or modify their gastrointestinal morphol? ogy in order to obtain the energy neces? sary to meet increased demands during winter. We performed an experiment of factorial design, consisting of 112 meadow voles, each assigned to one of eight trials, placed under the conditions of high (50% NDF) or low (5% NDF) dietary fiber, high (21 C) or low (5 C) temperature, and long (16L8D) or short (8L:16D) photoperiod to determine which of these environmental variables was most responsible for elicit- ing the behavioral or morphological changes required for meadow voles to survive the winter. Meadow voles in? creased food intake and decreased di? etary turnover time under the most de- manding environmental conditions. Con- sequently, they were able to compensate for their increased energy demands by increasing food intake and decreasing di? etary turnover time, and made only mini? mal changes to their gastrointestinal mor? phology. Dietary fiber level was the most important factor in eliciting these changes in intake rate, followed by ambient tem? perature and daylength, respectively. There were significant interactions be? tween the three factors and all play an important role in bringing about the changes necessary for meadow voles to endureharsh winter conditions.

Spadefoot toads exhibit a large diversity in larval period and size at metamorphosis. We used growth and development data to examine evolutionary, physiological, and morphological aspects of this diversity. To obtain comparable data across taxa, we reared tadpoles under laboratory conditions from all spadefoot toads and one parsley frog. Differences in growth and development suggested physiology, rather than pheno? typic plasticity, explained larval period diver? sity. Mapping larval data onto a molecular phylogeny indicated that rapid metamorpho? sis originated within the spadefoot toad fam? ily. To understand the physiological basis for accelerated metamorphosis, we used radio? immunoassay to estimate thyroid hormone levels throughout prometamorphosis and climax in Scaphiopus couchii, Spea multiplicata, and Pelobates syriacus. We also used an in vitro tail tip assay to measure tissue sensitivity to thyroid hormone. The higher thyroid hormone levels and the higher sensitivity of the tail in vitro in Sc. couchii correlated with its shorter larval period length. We examined the relationship between lar? val period length and gonad, spade, and thyroid develoement. Gonads and spades differentiated earlier in stage in Pelobates compared to Spea and Scaphiopus. In con? trast, thyroid gland differentiation correlated with larval size rather than larval period length. In conclusion, the differences in thy? roid physiology across taxa may be endo- crinological mechanisms underlying accel? erated metamorphosis. Also, because mor? phological development during metamor? phosis is affected by thyoid hormone, physi? ological evolution to shorten larval period in New World spadefoot toads may have had heterochronic side-effects in spadefoot de? velopment. 800-955-1236 ?

Influence of staged encounters on testosterone and corticosterone in free- living arctic ground squirrels. In a field study on the North Slope of Alaska we determined levels of plasma tes? tosterone and corticosterone for male arctic ground squirrels after emergence from hi? bernation in spring, throughout the mating season, and prior to their immergence into hibernation in late summer. In mid April re- productively active males emerged with tes? tes descended into the scrotum and with in? termediate levels of plasma testosterone. Testosterone levels remained constant at 2.9 ? 0.29 ng/ml for about 1 week before signifi? cantly increasing to the active season maxi? mum of 4.6 ? 0.42 ng/ml. A lesser peak in late summer of 2.7 ?0.17 ng/ml not associ? ated with testicular maturation was observed before levels decreased to the annual mini? mum of 1.7 ? 0.57 ng/ml prior to entrance to hibernation. Corticosterone levels did not vary significantly across season and aver? aged 4.3 ? 0.10 ng/ml. We tested the respon? siveness of plasma testosterone and corti? costerone to challenges by conspecific males by staging aggressive encounters be? tween males and comparing plasma levels of these animals to those of unmanipulated animals. The effect of staged encounters on testosterone level depended on time of year. Testosterone levels in spring were signifi? cantly up-modulated after a staged encoun? ter and were positively correlated to the rela? tive intensity of the encounter, whereas staged encounters in late summer had no significant effect on testosterone level. Cor? ticosterone levels in both spring and late summer were significantly increased by staged encounters and were positively cor? related to the relative intensity of the encoun? ter. These results suggest that circulating lev? els of testosterone and corticosterone in male arctic ground squirrels are the result of a combination of seasonal and social fac? tors.

The scientific literacy of our nation is a concern, but emerging insights about the cognitive development of learning and new educational technologies provide encour- agement that we may be engaged in a peda- gogical revolution. However, technology is no panacea. Exploiting the learning poten? tial of the web will require the promotion of inquiry-oriented and learning-centered prin? ciples, but most web sites are little more than electronic books, with little interactivity and less assessment. Interactivity can promote active learning styles. Assessment tools can provide real-time feedback, incentive sys? tems to facilitate competency-based learn? ing standards, and diagnostic clues about individual learning needs. Learning-cen? tered technology that is beginning to emerge may help us to grapple with one of the worst obstacles to teaching reform: the Coverage Dilemma. Many faculty are wary to spend valuable class time on time-intensive pedagogies. Assessment-rich, web-based instructional technology may allow us to move the authority of learning foundational information to our students on their own time, making room for more important learning goals in class time. The most exciting appli? cations of web-technology may be those that foster student experience in the process of science with research simulations or through access to online data and research tools. However, these more open-ended learning experiences tend to be more leaky peda- gogically; not all students are prepared to benefit from these more demanding experi? ences. Therefore, depending on the sophis- tication of the students, there may be a need for new instructional designs that provide assessment in new ways in these more de? manding, open-ended learning environ? ments. Lastly, we must develop web-based technology that promotes these science edu? cation standards for all students, not just for our majors. 958 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Ener? getic cost of osmoregulation as a function of size and salinity in Callinectes sapidus. In order to determine the energetic cost of osmoregulation in C. sapidus over a range of salinities, adult and juvenile crabs were acclimated to either sea water (1000 mOsm) or dilute sea water (150 mOsm). Oxygen uptake was measured in vivo with intact crabs and in vitro using gills removed from the crab and ligated at the proximal end. Data demonstrated that at each salinity there was a decrease in weight-specific oxygen uptake with increasing body mass and gill mass. Acclimation to dilute medium resulted in an increase in whole-animal oxygen up? take for crabs of all weights relative to that in sea water. Exposure of sea water-accli- mated posterior gills to 150 mOsm resulted in a rapid and marked increase in oxygen uptake relative to sea water. Nuclear mag? netic resonance spectroscopy on individual gills was able to resolve the relative con? centrations of all the major phosphate com? pounds involved in energy metabolism (argi? nine phosphate, ATP and inorganic phos? phate). Exposure of sea water-acclimated posterior gills to 150 mOsm resulted in a marked decrease in arginine phosphate and an increase in inorganic phosphate. P2ABBUDICK, S.B.*, O'MALLEY, D.M., Northeastern University Minimal behavioral deficits are observed after laser-ablation of the nMLF in larval zebrafish. Larval zebrafish exhibit a range of loco- motive behaviors including swimming, turn? ing and escaping. These behaviors are con? trolled by a relatively small group of brainstem neurons including cells of the nucleus MLF (nMLF) plus reticulospinal, vestibulospinal and T-reticular neurons. Little is known of the function of the nMLF cells, though they constitute perhaps 15% of the total descending motor control system in lar? val zebrafish. The nMLF cells are suggested to be involved in the initiation of swimming (Bernau et al. 1991; Uematsu and Todo, 1997) and might constitute part of the mid? brain locomotor region. Because laser-ab? lation is a useful technique for revealing the functional role of individually identified hind- brain neurons (Liu and Fetcho, 1999), we attempted to laser-ablate the nMLF both uni- laterally and bilaterally (a minimum of 7 cells/ hemisphere), using a 15mW Kr-Ar laser. Larval behavior was then analyzed after a recovery period of at least 24 hours. Spon? taneous locomotion, as measured by the number of swim bouts and the total distance swam over 30 minutes, was not effected by ablation. Furthermore, kinematic analysis of high-speed imaging data revealed no ma? jor deficits in either the escape-response or swimming. The data do suggest, however that the nMLF may be important for generat- ing high angular velocity, large amplitude escape responses. Occasionally, multiple, spontaneous C-bends occurred in rapid suc- cession. A striking feature of these C-bends was that they resulted in little forward pro? pulsion. Such abnormal C-bends were not observed in control fish. These results sug? gest that nMLF cells are not necessary for the initiation/control of swimming, but may contribute to the coordination or control of the escape response.

Measuring the metabolic cost of flight has been possible for a little more than thirty years. Since V A. Tucker's classic work with budgerigars, fewer than a dozen other spe? cies of birds have been flown in wind tun- nels in order to determine their metabolic rates during flight. Results from these stud? ies portray one of two patterns: either the metabolic cost of flight appears to be inde? pendent of flight speed, or the cost of flight appears as a U-shaped curve with increas? ing flight speed. All but Tucker's study show little increase in metabolic cost across the range of speeds for which data were ob? tained. In addition to the evidence provided by metabolic data, recent measurements of the mechanical power developed during flight also support the notion that birds are able to fly over a wide range of speeds with little change in the cost of flight. Flight costs in budgerigars should be viewed not as the 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Since Tucker's work stands in such stark contrast to nearly all of the avail? able data on flight costs, we have revisited his experiments in our tunnel, increasing both the sample size and the range of speeds over which the birds have been flown. Four Budgerigars were flown across a range of speeds (4-16 m/s), while wearing a mask in order to collect and analyze their expired air. Our measurements of the metabolic cost of flight agree well with those of Tucker's budg- ies. This confirmation of the original pub? lished pattern suggests that budgies are unlike other species and are unable to du? plicate the unknown mechanism that allows other birds to fly with costs that are indepen? dent of flight speed.

The physiology of positive inter? actions: effects of shade and season on en? dogenous levels of hsp70 in field popula? tions of the black chiton Katharina tunicata Canopy-forming algae can be important to consumers by providing food and protec? tion from predation or intense insolation. In the low rocky intertidal zone of the Pacific Northwest, the chiton Katharina tunicata is closely associated with the canopy-forming alga Hedophyllum sessile. In previous stud? ies, Hedophyllum canopy removal resulted in a dramatic drop in Katharina abundances, but the cause of this decline was not deter? mined. In a three-year field experiment, Katharina numbers were significantly higher in shaded plots (artificial shade or natural Hedophyllum) than in unshaded plots in the spring and summer, but abundances were not different in the fail and winter. During low tide on sunny summer days, Katharina body temperatures are 6 to 9?C warmer in the open than in the shade. These data sug? gest that the shade provided by the algal canopy is important for reducing heat stress for Katharina. To examine the effect of shade on the physiological state of chitons in the field, I used fences to maintain Katharina under shaded and unshaded conditions from April to November of 1999 and April to August of 2000. From monthly tissue samples of these chitons, I quantified en? dogenous levels of heat shock proteins (hsp70 isoforms). To examine the effect of seasonal ambient temperature on hsp70 levels, I also collected monthly tissue samples from the unmanipulated Katharina field population from April 1999 to August 2000. These data on seasonal and shade- related variations in the heat-shock re? sponse of Katharina, combined with data from a long-term ecological study, give a unique picture of the interacting effects of physiology and ecology on community struc? ture.

Physi? ological origin and reproductive conse- quence of variation in daily energy expendi? ture: a study of breeding tree swallows. We studied tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) provisioning dependent young to test for relationships among parental daily en? ergy expenditure (DEE), the masses of in? ternal organs/tissues, and indices of breed? ing success. We predicted: (1) parental DEE would increase with brood size and nestling condition, and (2) adults with high DEE would require large internal organs and high meta? bolic capacities in their pectoral muscles. We measured the growth rate of nestlings from natural broods of 5, 6 and 7 over a 4-day period, followed by parental DEE using the doubly labeled water technique. Adults were then dissected and internal organs were weighed. As an index of capacity for flux through specific steps in various metabolic pathways, we measured the activity of cit- rate synthase, pyruvate kinase, HOAD, and lactate dehydrogenase in the pectoral muscle. The growth rate of nestlings was independent of the brood size in which they were reared. This indicated that adults did not trade-off nestling quality for quantity. Despite predictions, parental DEE was also independent of brood size. We hypothesize that adults differed in foraging efficiency and matched their clutch size to their own indi? vidual provisioning abilities. Among individu? als with the same sized broods, in one of 960 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

There was no relationship between an individual's DEE and the size of any internal organ or the metabolic capacity of the pectoral muscle. Consequently, a previous sugges? tion that large internal organs allow for the maintenance of high-energy budgets is not supported.

Mortality rates of the aquacultured shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei injected with Vibrio parahaemolyticus are significantly in? creased when the bacterial challenge is accompanied by an immediate shift from well-aerated water to sub-lethal hypoxia (acute hypoxia). A more realistic scenario is that shrimp raised in intensive culture or in natural ecosystems would be exposed for longer periods of time to sub-lethal hypoxia (chronic hypoxia). The present study ad- dressed the possibility that animals might adapt to chronic hypoxia, returning to a more disease- resistant status. Juvenile L. vannamei (1.0 - 1.5 g) were either main? tained under normoxia or exposed to sub? lethal hypoxia (4% 02, 2% C02 and pH of 6.8-7.0). After seven days animals from both exposure conditions were injected intramus- cularly with an LD50 dose (105/shrimp) of V. parahaemolyticus. Both test groups were held under sub-lethal hypoxia for 48 hours and monitored for survival. Mortality rates were compared by a repeated measures two-way ANOVA. Chronic (7 day) hypoxia significantly increased mortality rates in chal? lenged shrimp compared to acute hypoxia. Taken together with our previous studies (Mikulski etal., [2000] J. Shellfish Res. 19:301- 311), these data show that both acute and chronic hypoxia increased susceptibility of L vannameito bacterial challenge. Further? more, these shrimp did not successfully adapt to overcome the suppressive effects of hypoxia on disease resistance, rather the animals displayed higher mortality rates with increased time of exposure to hypoxia.

The status of Corallimorpharia (Cnidaria, Anthozoa) based on molecular data from mitochrondrial 16s rDNA and nuclear 28s DNA. Corallimorpharia is an order of Anthozoa (phylum Cnidaria) that is cur? rently considered equivalent in rank to Scleractinia (hard corals) and Actiniaria (sea anemones). Rather than being an independent order, Corallimorpharia has been hypothesized to be part of Scleractinia or Actiniaria. Morphological evidence supports corallimorpharians as more closely related to scleractinians. Published sequence data for mitochon? drial 16S rDNA and nuclear 18S rDNA support the position of corallimorpharians within the scleractinian clade, but data from nuclear 28S rDNA support them being more closely related to actiniarians. Dif? ferences in taxon sampling and methods of analysis, and small sample sizes have contributed to problems with comparing among molecular analyses.

EMA is defined as the ratio of limb muscle force to ground reaction force integrated over the time of limb contact with the ground. It was measured at each of the leg joints (hip, knee, ankle) and then averaged for an overall measure. Data from the nine runners mea? sured indicate that, as opposed to steady state running in which EMA does not change with speed, EMA increases slightly as the subject increases speed by accelerating in the first several steps of a sprint. EMA distri? bution between joints also changes during acceleration, with hip EMA starting low and increasing while knee EMA starts high and decreases. These results imply that during rapid acceleration, more of the force is sup- plied by hip extensor muscles whereas dur? ing steady state running, these muscles have diminished importance and supporting force is generated more by knee extensors. Un? derstanding muscle mechanics during ac? celeration thus has implications for fiber type distribution at different joints and for better quantifying the mechanics and energetics of free-ranging animals who rarely move at a steady rate. 27.3 CARELLO,CA.*,SCHEUNMANN,T L, HEITMANN, D. M., University of Wiscon- sin-Eau Claire. How body size affects the metabolic efficiency and lower limb joint ki? nematics of quail running on an incline. The majority of studies dealing with bi? pedal locomotion on varying surface grades have focused on humans. Thus, little is known about the relationship between body mass and efficiency of locomotion for running on inclines in non-human bipeds. In order to quantify this relationship in quail we used oxygen consumption analysis to determine the efficiency of incline running in small But- ton Quail (43g) and large Mountain Quail (211g). We found that Mountain Quail were metabolically more efficient than Button Quail when running uphill. In an attempt to explain the mechanisms responsible for this relationship between body mass and effi? ciency, we then conducted kinematic analy- sis on the hip, knee and ankle joints for level and inciine running. We found that the range of motion for extension of all lower limb joints increased on an inciine. We also found that there was a relatively greater increase in the extension of the limb joints in the smaller Button Quail when compared to the larger Mountain Quail. Extension of the lower limb joints occurs during the acceleration phase of the step and this is therefore considered the energetically costly phase of the step. Thus, smaller animals incur a reduction in metabolic efficiency because their lower limb joints must undergo a greater range of mo? tion during the most energetically expensive phase of the step. 45.2 CARL, T.

Derivation of most if not all of the ossified skull from the embryonic neural crest is an accepted axiom of contemporary develop? mental biology. Yet, this "fact" is based on direct empirical results involving just one species of vertebrate, the domestic chicken. Anuran amphibians (frogs) pose a particu? larly difficult challenge in this regard: bone typically forms many weeks after hatching, and tracing individual cells over this lengthy interval is technically difficult. We used RNA encoding for green fluorescent protein (GFP) to label premigratory neural crest in embryos of Xenopus laevis, and assessed cranial de? rivatives both before and after metamorpho? sis. Results confirm the neural crest contri? bution to larval cranial cartilages demon? strated previously by using conventional vi? tal stains, lineage markers, and ablation tech? niques. They also provide evidence for the neural crest derivation of a major paired skull bone, the frontoparietal; other, later-forming bones are currently under study. This is the first direct empirical demonstration of neural crest contribution to the ossified skull in any amphibian. Supported by NSF. 962 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

We ex? amined the function of Slug in the frog Xeno? pus laevisby injecting antisense RNA (ASR) targeted to the 3' UTR of Xenopus Slug (XSlug). Injection of XSlug ASR inhibits neu? ral crest-cell migration and leads to reduc? tion or loss of many neural crest derivatives, including pigment cells and cranial cartilages. Moreover, regions injected with XSlug ASR show significantly elevated lev? els of cell death, and expanded regions of the BMP-4antagonist, Chordin.

SBA3CARR, J.A.*, BROWN, CL, MANSOURI, R., VENKATESAN, S., Texas Tech University, Lubbock. Stress, neuropep? tides, and feeding behavior: an evolutionary perspective. Stress inhibits feeding behavior in all vertebrates. Data from mammals suggest an important role for hypothalamic neuropep? tides, in particular the melanocortins and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), in mediating stress-induced anorexia. The ef? fects of CRH on food intake are evolution- arily ancient, as this peptide inhibits feeding in fishes, birds, and mammals. The effects of melanocortins on food intake have been studied only in mammals. Although there is evidence that CRH and the melanocortins influence hypothalamic circuitry controlling food intake, these peptides may have a more primitive role in modulating visuomotor path? ways involved in the recognition and acqui? sition of food. Stress rapidly reduces visu- ally-guided prey-catching behavior in toads, an effect that can be mimicked by adminis- tration of CRH, while corticosterone and iso- proterenol are without effect. Melanocortins also reduce prey-oriented turning move? ments and, in addition, facilitate the acquisi? tion of habituation to a moving prey item. The effects of these neuropeptides are rapid, occurring within 30 min after administration. Thus, changes in neuroendocrine status during stress may dramatically influence the efficacy with which visual stimuli release feeding behavior. By modulating visuomotor processing these neuropeptides may help animals make appropriate behavioral deci? sions during stress.

Homology and the evolution of non? avian dinosaur locomotion. Non-avian dinosaurs diversified through? out the Mesozoic from a single bipedal, parasagittal-limbed ancestor. Their 140-my radiation spanned over three orders of mag? nitude in body size and included eight ma? jor clades. In spite of this, diversification within the dinosaurian locomotor apparatus appears to have been comparatively re? stricted. I analyzed dinosaur hind limb and pelvic anatomy within a cladistic framework in order to quantify these patterns of change. Using methods to analyze both discrete and continuous characters in a phylogenetic context, I identified where homoplasy con- stitutes parallelism and might thereby be used to infer similar selective pressures on hind limb function. Finally, I evaluated the resulting phylogenetic patterns in light of ter? restrial locomotor biomechanics. These analyses revealed repeated, independent derivations of several morphological fea? tures that have potential relevance for hind limb locomotor function. These include an- teroposterior expansion of the ilium, medial reorientation of the femoral head, and el? evation of the femoral lesser trochanter. Such parallel changes appear to reflect the en? largement of several major hind limb muscles, as well as a trend towards switch- ing their predominant function from abduc- tion-adduction to protraction-retraction.

Does morphology correlate with prey capture ki? nematics in leptodactylid frogs? Leptodactylid frogs exhibit diversity of the tongue and jaw mechanics during prey cap? ture. Two mechanisms of prey capture have been seen in leptodactylids: inertial elonga? tion and mechanical pulling. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that inertial elongatidn has evolved independently from mechanical pulling several times within leptodactylids. The goal of this study is to examine the evo? lution of feeding mechanisms in this diverse group of frogs. Feeding mechanisms of frogs can be categorized based on patterns of ki? nematics. The primary kinematic difference between inertial elongation and mechani? cal pulling is the movements of the tongue and jaw. During inertial elongation, the move? ments of the tongue and jaw are precisely coordinated, whereas in mechanical pull? ing, these movements are uncoupled. Leptodactylids that are considered to be in? ertial elongators tend to have short gape cycles (-11 ms), a high velocity of the lower jaw during mouth opening, and a great in? crease in the length of the tongue (180% of resting length). In contrast, leptodactylid frogs that are defined as mechanical pullers generally have longer gape cycles (-28 ms), slower velocity of the lower jaw, and a de? crease in the length of the tongue during protraction (40% of resting length). Thus, we expect to find relative differences in the le? ver system of the jaw between inertial elongators and mechanical pullers. Inertial elongators should have proportionally shorter in-levers in order to maximize the speed of mouth opening, while mechanical pullers should have proportionally longer in- levers in order to maximize the force of mouth closing. The variability in kinematics and morphology among species of leptodactylids may reflect differences in the foraging ecol? ogy between species. 21.3 CARRIER, DR. *, LEE, D. V, WALTER, R. M., University of Utah, Salt Lake City. Influ? ence of rotational inertia on the turning per? formance of theropod dinosaurs. Turning agility of theropod dinosaurs may have been severely limited by the large rotational inertia of their horizontal trunks and tails. Bodies with mass distributed far from the axis of rotation have much greater rota? tional inertia than bodies with the same mass distributed close to the axis of rotation. In this study, we increased the rotational iner? tia of human subjects 4.6 times, to match our estimate for theropods the size of humans, and measured the subjects' ability to turn. To determine the torque required to execute turns, three subjects performed 45 degree jump turns on a force platform. When the rotational inertia was increased 4.6-fold, the time to push-off increased 1.8-fold and the torque impulse applied to the ground in? creased 3.76-fold. To determine the effect of the increased rotational inertia on maximum turning capability, five subjects performed jump turns in which they jumped vertically from a standing position and attempted to spin as far as possible before landing. This test resulted in a 4.9-fold decrease in the angle turned. We also tested the ability of three subjects to perform sharp running turns in a tight slalom course of six 90 degree turns. When the subjects ran with the 4.6-fold greater rotational inertia, the time to com? plete the course increased by 34 %. Hence, the results from these tests suggest that ro? tational inertia may have limited the turning performance of theropods. Characters such as retroverted pubes, reduced tail length, decreased body size, pneumatic vertebrae, and absence of teeth reduced rotational in? ertia in derived theropods and may have improved their turning agility. To reduce ro? tational inertia, theropods may have run with an arched back and tail, an S-curved neck, and forelimbs held backwards against the body.

McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="41">Sturgeon (Acipenseridae) are a basal actinopterygians with a highly derived cra? nial morphology. Despite their anatomi? cal singularity and phylogenetic signifi? cance, no functional study of the kinemat? ics of sturgeon feeding has been pub? lished. Feeding pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) were filmed in lat? eral and ventral views at 250 frames per second. Feeding events were character? ized by jaw opening, jaw protrusion, cau- dal-ventral retraction of the hyoid, ventral expansion of the branchial basket, and adduction followed by abduction of the opercular margin. Prey items were drawn into open jaws which were closed after prey entry, indicating that sturgeon feed by suction rather than biting. Evidence from muscle stimulation and anatomy support previously published hypotheses about the muscular basis of feeding kinematics. The sturgeon's jaws are not directly connected to its neurocranium, but are suspended from the hyoid arch and may be protruded ventrally. Protrusion is powered by the pro- tractor hyomandibularis muscle which ro? tates the hyomandibula rostrally at its ar? ticulation to the neurocranium. This ros? tral rotation is transmitted to the jaws, which are deflected ventrally by the ventrally sloping underside of the neurocranium. This mechanism of jaw protrusion is unique to the order Acipenseriformes. The robust sternohyoideus drives hyoid retraction, jaw opening, and branchial basket expan? sion. Jaw opening by the sternohyoideus is the hypothesized ancestral jaw open? ing mechanism for actinopterygians. De? spite the morphological differences be? tween sturgeon and other lineages the ki? nematics of sturgeon feeding are essen- tially similar to other aquatic-feeding gnathostomes.

Stress and Pacific salmon: a new look at the role of cor? tisol in olfaction and home-stream migration. Pacific salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) exhibit an interesting and uncommon life- history pattern that combines semelparity, anadromy, and navigation (homing). Dur? ing smoltification, young salmon imprint on the chemical composition of their natal stream water (the home-stream olfactory bouquet or "HSOB'); they then migrate to the ocean where they spend a few years feed? ing prior to migrating back to their natal fresh? water stream to spawn. Upstream migration is guided by the amazing ability to discrimi? nate between the chemical compositions of different stream waters and thus identify and travel to their home-stream. Pacific salmon demonstrate marked somatic and neural degeneration changes during home-stream migration and at the spawning grounds. The appearance of these pathologies is corre? lated with a marked elevation in plasma cor? tisol levels. While the mechanisms of salmo? nid homing are not completely understood, it is known that adult salmon continuously utilize two of their primary sensory systems, olfaction and vision, during homing. Olfac- tion is the primary sensory system involved in freshwater homing and HSOB recogni? tion, and will be emphasized here. I have hypothesized that the increase in plasma cortisol during home-stream migration of Pacific salmon is adaptive because it en? hances the ability to recall the imprinted memory of the HSOB. Elevated plasma con? centrations of cortisol could prime the hip- pocampus or other olfactory regions of the brain to recall this memory and, therefore, aid in directing the fish to their natal stream. Thus, specific responses of salmon to stres? sors could enhance reproductive success. P3.9A CARSTENS, B. C *, LUNDRIGAN, B.

The influence of hybridization on anemonefish evolution. Anemonef ishes (Genera.Amphiprion and Premnas', Family Pomacentridae) are a group of 28 species of coral reef fishes that are obligate symbionts of large tropical sea anemones. A recent molecular phylogenetic study of anemonefishes, based on data from two mitochondrial genes (cyt b and 16S) for six representative species, produced a phy? logeny that was significantly different from a previous phylogeny based on morphologi? cal data. To further evaluate this difference, we have sequenced another mitochondrial gene (ND2) and a nuclear gene (Tmo-4C4) for 14 species of anemonefishes. The phy? logeny based on mitochondrial data was significantly different from the phylogeny based on nuclear data. Because mitchondrial DNA is maternally inherited, phylogenies based on mitochondrial data can be misleading if hybridization among species has occurred. At least one anemonefish species (Amphiprion leucokranos) is thought to be the result of hybridization between two very different anemonefish species (A. chrysopterus and A. sandaracinos). Both our mitochondrial and nuclear data provide molecular evi? dence for the hybrid origin of A. leucokranos. The nuclear data also indicate that other anemonefish species may be the result of past hybridization events. This suggests that hybridization may have been important in anemonefish speciation and that reticulate evolution is a plausible explanation for the diversification patterns observed in this group of coral reef fishes. 56.4 CASH, W.B.*, HOLBERTON, R.L, Maryville College, University of Maine, Orono. Stress and the slider turtle. We examined physiological and behav? ioral questions related to stress, locomotor activity and dispersal movement in the slider turtle, Trachemys scripta. Like many other vertebrates, slider turtles show a corticos? terone response to capture and handling, characterized by an increase in plasma cor? ticosterone concentration with handling time. In the laboratory, turtles implanted with ex? ogenous corticosterone showed a significant increase in caged locomotor activity when compared to control animals with empty im- plants. In the field, the effects of the simu? lated drying of a pond on the behavior of T. scripta were measured. Turtles responded to the draining of a pond by the emigration of the majority (75%) of the experimental population. Turtles had significantly elevated corticosterone when compared to individu? als captured in a control pond, where condi? tions were held constant. However, 25% of the experimental group did not emigrate from the pond, suggesting that there is natural variation in turtle populations when respond? ing to habitat declines, like rapidly decreas? ing quality or availability. Finally, aspects of the annual cycles of corticosterone were studied in wild and laboratory-held slider turtles. Male sliders were found to exhibit both a change in baseline corticosterone and the ability to respond to handling stress throughout the period studied. Female slid? ers did not show a significant difference in their baseline corticosterone concentrations, but did show a difference in their stress re? sponse over the sampling period. These results show collectively that corticosterone is involved with the ability of slider turtles to respond to environmental disturbances and corticosterone may ultimately be the proxi? mate mechanism facilitating a stress avoid? ance response.

Parameters measured included individual microvillus surface area, microvilli packing density and absolute surface area. In both species, a greater surface area and packing density of microvilli occurred within the rectum and the cecae. Overall, the three measured variables were not statistically significant between species at the 95% confidence level. In the cecae, microvilli within the savannah spar? row had a higher individual surface area, packing density and absolute surface area than in the house sparrow.

Experimentally el? evated testosterone in male dark-eyed jun? cos suppresses cell-mediated immune func? tion of social mates and offspring. The immunocompetence handicap hy? pothesis (ICHH) predicts that testosterone- dependent secondary sexual signals that at- tract females also serve as honest indica? tors of male quality owing to testosterone's suppressive effect on immune function. Only males of high quality can express attractive traits and resist disease despite suppressed immunity. We have previously shown, as predicted by the ICHH, that experimental elevation of testosterone (T) in male dark- eyed juncos suppresses immunity and en? hances male attractiveness to females. We have also shown that T suppresses male parental behavior and that females attempt to compensate for reduced male care by in? creasing their own parental effort. Here we test whether the effects of treating males with T might extend beyond individual males and indirectly influence immune function of their social mates and offspring. We used wing-web swelling in response to an anti- genic challenge as a test of cell-mediated immunity. We tested free-living females jun? cos that were mated to T-treated males (T- males) or controls (C-males), and tested off? spring of those matings. We found that im? mune responses were significantly sup? pressed in mates of T-males (41 % lower) and their offspring (19% lower) as compared to those of C-males. Combining these results with earlier findings, we suggest that the costs to males of T-induced attractiveness may go beyond immunosuppression. Re? ductions in T-nestling immunity may explain a previous finding that in juncos T-males fledge significantly fewer young from their nests than C-males. Additionally, the conse? quences for females of choosing males with traits enhanced by T appear to be more com? plicated than previously thought.

Reduction of cold hardiness in overwintering Colorado potato beetles us? ing ice nucleating bacteria. A key factor in the overwintering survival of Colorado potato beetle (CPB) is the regu? lation of the temperature at which the insect freezes. Like most overwintering insects, CPBs are unable to survive internal ice for? mation. Winter survival is enhanced by both burrowing into the ground and by lowering their supercooling point, the temperature at which ice formation spontaneously occurs in their body fluids. We have shown that the supercooling capacity, a major factor in win? ter cold hardening of CPBs, can be regu? lated by exposure to ice nucleating active (INA) bacteria. Ingestion of INA Pseudomo- nas fluorescens immediately elevates the beetle's supercooling point. Furthermore, retention ofthe bacterium in burrowed CPBs' guts through winter increases their suscep? tibility to sub-zero temperatures. Reduction of the CPB's cold hardiness using INA bac? teria offers a novel method for controlling these beetles by targeting the overwintering population. 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Optimal sprint speeds of fish travers- ing velocity barriers: further thoughts on burst-swimming data. Migrating fish traversing velocity barriers are often forced to swim at speeds greater than Ucrjt. Since prolonged and burst-swim? ming are powered by inefficient anaerobic metabolic processes, models predicting optimal swim speeds based on maximized energetic efficiency are inappropriate in this situation. Instead of efficiency, fish need to maximize distance of ascent, both to maxi- mize probability of success and to minimize the number of ascent attempts with their as? sociated metabolic costs, recovery time, etc. From the standard fatigue-time equation (InE = a + bU; E= endurance, U= swim speed), we show that there exists an optimal ground speed for maximizing traversed distance against any flow velocity greater than Ucrit, and this speed equals -Mb. Six migratory fish species allowed to sprint volitionally against fixed flow velocities of 1.5 - 4.5 m*s 1 chose similar ground speeds regardless of flow velocity, supporting the hypothesis that sprinting speeds are modulated to maxi? mize distance of ascent. 58.2 CAVEY, M.J. *, WILKENS, J.L, Univer? sity of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. F-actin in the amuscular arteries of the American lob? ster. Seven vessels leave the heart of the lob? ster Homarus americanus-. the unpaired an? terior median artery, sternal artery, and dor? sal abdominal artery and the paired anterior lateral arteries and hepatic arteries. Superfi- cially, these arteries have a common, rela- tively-simple organization, consisting of an elastic lamina next to the lumen, a multilay- ered endothelium, and an enveloping ad- ventitia of collagen fibers. Patches of striated muscle cells occur in sectors of the dorsal abdominal artery. All of these arteries should serve as "capacitance" vessels, utilizing elas? tic elements to minimize the pulsatility of hemolymph flow from the heart. It has been proposed that lobster arteries, with the pos? sible exception of the dorsal abdominal ar- tery, cannot contribute to the differential dis? tribution of hemolymph owing to the absence of diameter-regulating muscle (and, hence, the inability to control their individual resis? tances). Comparative ultrastructural studies have now revealed extensive networks of cytoplasmic filaments in the endothelial cells of the amuscular arteries. All vessels were prepared in tandem for immunohistochem- istry for F-actin.They were slit lengthwise and opened onto microscope slides. The vascu? lar spreads were fixed with formaldehyde, permeabilized with Triton-X 100, and stained with rhodamine phalloidin. Both sarcomeric myofilaments in the muscle cells of the dor? sal abdominal artery and the aggregated fila? ments in the endothelial cells of the six amuscular arteries stain positively for F-ac- tin. It thus appears that the muscular and amuscular arteries alike may have the prop? erties of "resistance" vessels, possessing the contractile machinery by which to regulate their diameters and actively control hemolymph flow. 53.1 CAV I EDES-V I DAL, E . , KARASOV,WH.*, Universidad Nacional de San Luis, Argentina, University of Wiscon? sin, Madison. Developmental changes in di? gestive enzymes of nestling house spar? rows, Passer domesticus. Six decades of studies have speculated that digestive capacity might limit avian growth rate, or that developmental changes in the gut might determine developmental changes in digestive efficiency. However, there are no studies on digestive biochem? istry during avian development, except for studies on mainly domestic birds that ex? hibit the precocial mode of development. We studied pancreatic and intestinal enzyme activities during development of a wild pas? serine bird exhibiting the altricial mode of development. Wild nestling house sparrows were studied immediately after removal from the nest (days 0,3,6 of age; day 0 = hatch), whereas captives were raised in the labora? tory beginning day 3 on a formulated casein/ starch-based diet until fledging age (after day 12). Digestive biochemistry was dy? namic. Tissue-specific activities of some di? gestive enzymes continued to increase 968 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

House sparrows differ from poultry, in whom after about 2 weeks of age the specific activ? ity of intestinal and pancreatic digestive en? zymes is generally constant or declines dur? ing development. The data on intestinal and pancreatic enzymes help explain why diges? tive efficiency of nestling house sparrows improves with age, and the data seem con? sistent with the idea that digestive capacity might limit feeding rate and hence growth rate.

Like other caterpillars, the tobacco horn? worm (Manduca sexta) is essentially an eating machine that consumes large amounts of food to fuel the growth and de? velopment of the subsequent two develop? mental stages. Commensurate with its huge appetite is a large midgut, which is involved in the digestion and absorption of food as well as the transport of inorganic ions. The larval midgut, however, is destined to be de? stroyed and replaced by a pupal epithelium. Within the first two to three days of the fifth and final larval instar, there is a small in? crease hemolymph ecdysteroids. This small increase in ecdysteroids does not induce molting, but does commit the insect to meta? morphosis. This commitment is manifested on day 5 of the instar (wandering stage), as indicated by the appearance of a dorsal ves? sel and cessation of feeding. At the same time midgut short-circuit current and transepithelial potential decline 80% and 49%, respectively. Mitochondrial metabolism is also altered upon the onset of wandering. Mitochondria isolated from the midguts of day 5 larvae oxidize palmitoyl carnitine and succinate at rates that are 40% and 60% of the respective rates in mitochondria isolated from day 4 larvae. In addition, the membrane potential is lower in mitochondria isolated from the midguts of wandering larvae. Be? cause these physiological and metabolic changes coincide with the onset of wander? ing, the midgut appears to modulated by ecdysteroids. Furthermore, the changes in midgut metabolism and ion transport occur abruptly, indicating that the larval midgut is destroyed by programmed cell death, rather than by a gradual senescence of the tissue. 70.2 CHAN, S.-M., GU, P-L, University of Hong Kong. The study of shrimp CHH/MIH/ GIH gene family: gene structure, expression and biological assay of recombinant neu? ropeptides. The crustacean CHH/MIH/GIH neu? ropeptide family constitutes a group of im? portant hormone that regulates important processes such as molting, glucose metabo? lism and reproduction. The characteriza? tion of these neuropeptides has attracted much attention due to their potential impor? tance in aquaculture. By RT-PCR and library screening approach, we have isolated and cloned four cDNAs from the eyestalk of the shrimp Metapenaeus ensis. Two of the cDNAs encoded for proteins are homolo? gous to the CHH-subtypes and two of the cDNA encoded for proteins belong to the MIH/GIH subtypes. The organizations of these genes are very similar. They consist of three exons and two introns with conserved location of boundaries between the intron- exon. There are more than 20 CHH-A genes, 5-6 CHH-B genes and 1-2 copies of MIH and GIH gene in the shrimp genome. CHH-A, CHH-B, MIH- and GIH RNA tran? scripts can be detected in the eyestalk of animal at most stages. Only CHH-A and GIH transcripts are detected in ventral nerve cord. Recombinant proteins for these neuropep? tides have been produced and used for bio? assay. Additionally, the recombinant proteins were purified for antibody generation.

Molecular characterization of a cDNA encoding for a shrimp cellular retinoic acid/retinol binding protein. Members of the cellular retinoic acid bind? ing protein (CRABP) family are small pro? teins involved in the metabolic pathways of retinoic acid (RA). Although there is report describing the cloning of a retinoic-X recep? tor, no report describes the presence of RA in crustacean. To determine whether RA is also involved in the regulation of develop? ment and whether CRABP is also involved in the metabolism of RA in crustacean, we attempt to clone the CRABP cDNAs from the shrimp using a combination of RT-PCR and library screening approach. Several identi? cal cDNA clones encoding the putative MeCRABP were isolated. As confirmed by DNA sequence determination and RNA Northern blot analysis, the size ofthe CRABP mRNA is 0.9 kb. The cDNA is estimated to encode for a protein of 14 kDa. The size is close to that of the retinoic/fatty acid binding protein reported in the vertebrate and inver? tebrate. MeCRABP is expressed abundantly in the ovary and moderately in the eyestalk. Other tissues such as the muscles and testis also express these genes. Recombinant protein for the shrimp CRABP was produced in a pRSET bacteria expression system. Purified fusion protein was used to immu- nize rabbit to raise antibody.

Decapod crustaceans have been a par? ticularly interesting and rewarding group of animals for the study of comparative endo? crinology. Most of the published studies, however, have dealt with the hormones of the adult stage; relatively few studies have addressed the hormones of the embryonic and larval stages. The most widely studied hormones during crustacean ontogeny are the arthropod molting hormones?the ecdysteroids. Following a brief survey of crus? tacean endocrinology, I will present a se? lected review of what is known about ecdysteroids in the various crustacean life stages. The ecdysteroids are multifunctional and are involved in a number of life pro? cesses (growth, regeneration, and repro? duction).

Enhanced passive absorption in the presence of luminal nutri? ents in house sparrows. We previously demonstrated in house sparrows substantial absorption in vivo of L- glucose, the stereoisomer of D-glucose that does not interact with the intestine's D-glu? cose transporter. The mechanism, as first proposed by Pappenheimer and coworkers in 1987, might be solvent drag through paracellular spaces, activated by Na+- coupled nutrient transport. This hypothesis predicts that absorption of L-glucose might be highest when it is administered orally in the presence of D-glucose and/or amino acids. We tested this in two experiments with house sparrows (Passer domesticus) using pharmacokinetic methods to measure absorption. In Exp. 1, fractional absorption of L-glucose (administered by oral gavage and measured by enzymatic method in plasma) in fed sparrows was higher (0.46 +- 0.02, n = 7) than in sparrows fasted 12 h (0.40 +- 0.01, n = 6) (simple t-testT = -2.27, P = 0.044, DF= 11 ).The greater absorption was apparently not due simply to longer reten? tion time of digesta, because no significant difference was found for retention times. In Exp. 2, fractional absorption of radiolabeled L-glucose was significantly higher when ad? ministered to fasted birds in solution with 200 mM D-glucose (+ 80 mM NaCl) than when administered with 200 mM mannitol (+ 80 mM NaCl) (respectively, 0.79 + 0.04 vs. 0.66 + 0.03; T= -2.47, P=0.035, DF= 9).

Cytology and ultrastructure of the extraembryonic membranes of the quail, Coturnix coturnix. In avian eggs, the yolk sac and chorioal- lantoic membrane (CAM) provide nutrients and gas exchange for the developing em? bryo. Despite avian diversity, most of what is known about anatomy and physiology of these extraembryonic membranes in birds comes from studies on the domestic chicken. Quail tissues were harvested at Days 7 and 14 following oviposition, and studied by means of transmission EM and light micros? copy of resin-embedded tissues. Chick tis? sues were sampled for comparison. At Day 7, the yolk sac is trilaminar, consisting of a thin monolayer of squamous epithelial cells, the vitelline capillaries, and the underlying yolk endoderm. The endodermal cells are rich in mitochondria and phagocytosed yolk droplets. Between the first and second week of incubation, the CAM undergoes progres? sive expansion at the expense of the yolk sac, and lines much of the inner surface of the eggshell with allantoic vessels. A thin squamous epithelium overlies the allantoic capillaries, providing a thin barrier to respi? ratory exchange. Tail intercalated cells with microvilli and abundant mitochondria span the CAM, extending towards the shell mem? brane. These cells have been implicated in calcium uptake in the chick by previous work? ers. Given that qualitative cytological differ? ences between the quail and chick were not observed, our ongoing work is focusing on quantitative comparisons in abundance and ontogeny of cell populations.

Three patterns of ontogeny of postem? bryonic osmoregulation have been recog? nized in crustaceans : (1) osmoregulation varies little with development stage and the adults are weak regulators or osmoconformers; (2) the adult type of effi? cient osmoregulation is established in the first postembryonic stage; (3) metamorpho? sis marks the appearance of the adult type of osmoregulation, generallyalong with the occurrence of ion-transporting cells and Na- K ATPase in diverse organs. This review will concentrate on the ontogeny of osmoregu? lation in embryos, particularly in species be? longing to type 2 : they are euryhaline and so are their hatchlings. Embryos are osmoti- cally protected against variations in environ? mental salinity levels, either by closed incu- bating pouches (in some cladocerans and isopods), semi-closed pouches (where os? molality is at least partially controlled by the diverted female urine, in some amphipods), or more generally by egg membranes (in species whose eggs are directly exposed to the ambient medium). In some species, tem? porary (e.g. dorsal organs in amphipods) or definitive (e.g. gills in crayfish) osmoregula? tory organs, where ionocytes are located, develop in embryos and the activity of Na-K ATPase increases concomitantly. The ability to osmoregulate is thus acquired during the embryonic development, resulting in osmoregulating hatchlings, which is a nec? essary and key adaptation for species spend- ing their entire life-cycle at low (particularly in fresh water), high or variable salinity.

Experimen? tal evaluation of vitellogenin as a predic? tive biomarker for reproductive disruption. Vitellogenin (VTG) synthesis in male oviparous vertebrates is used as an indica? tor of environmental estrogen exposure, yet the reproductive consequences of exposure are unknown. To examine whether VTG ex? pression predicts reproductive impairment, we exposed medaka fry (Oryzias latipes) for 2 or 8 weeks post-hatch to 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 7.5 ppb of the environmental estrogen o, p' DDT. Fish were sampled 2, 4, and 8 weeks after hatch to examine gonad histol- ogy and VTG expression. After exposure, fish were transferred to clean water, grown to sexual maturity, and placed in mating pairs. Eggs were collected for 7 days and scored for fecundity, fertility, and hatching success. Two week exposure had no effect on VTG expression, while all doses induced VTG after 8 weeks. The highest doses of DDT caused a female-skewed sex ratio in adults. Gonadal feminization appeared to be progressive - some ovotestes appeared after 2 and 4 weeks exposure to the two high? est doses, but the proportion of ovaries in? creased after 8 weeks. Both two and eight week exposure significantly reduced fertility and hatching success at all doses, but lower doses had a greater effect after longer ex? posure. Fertility and hatching success were more sensitive to estrogenic disruption than was VTG synthesis. Therefore, VTG expres? sion may be interpreted as a warning of re? productive consequences, but absence of expression cannot be interpreted as absence of developmental and reproductive disrup? tion.

The perciform suborder of otothenioid fishes is indigenous to the Southern Ocean and largely endemic to the Antarctic region. Currently 8 families encompassing -130 species are recognized. Twelve species makes up 3 basal, non-Antarctic families in? habiting the temperate regions of S. America, Australia, and New Zealand. The majority of the species make up the other 5 families, most of which are confined to the Antarctic region; only about 14 species of these have a sub-Antarctic and south temperate distri? bution. The Antarctic water is isolated from other southern oceans by the Antarctic Cir- cumpolar Current (ACC), a major oceano- graphic barrier which also prevents dis? persal of fish in either direction. The 3 basal families presumably diverged and became along the south temperate continents be? fore Antarctica was fully isolated (22-25mya). The 5 endemic Antarctic families are thought to have arisen in situ within the Antarctic wa? ter, the result of an adaptive radiation under? went by the ancestral notothenioid stock 972 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="49">which evolved antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGP) to avoid freezing as the Antarctic wa? ter chilled to subzero temperatures. Given the ACC barrier to dispersal, the origin of the extant south temperate notothenioids has been an enigma. Since AFGP gene evolved once before the notothenioid radia? tion, and its evolution was directly linked to the freezing of the Antarctic water, the pres? ence of AFGP genes in the extant temper? ate water notothenioids can be used as a marker to infer their geographic origin of speciation. Several species were found to have AFGP genes, two even express the protein at low levels, which would argue for an Antarctic origin of speciation where and when antifreeze protection was needed, and a subsequent escape to the south temper? ate regions. 8.5 CHIU, C.-H. P*, WAGNER, G. P*, Yale University. Molecular evolution across the fin- limb transition. Evolutionary innovations in morphologi? cal characters are realized through the evo? lutionary modification of genes controlling the development of the characters. We fol- low this line of thought and examine the evo? lution of genes involved in the development of fins and limbs to gain insights into the molecular underpinnings of the origin of tet? rapod limbs. Specifically we study the cod? ing and non-coding regions of Hoxa-11 and Hoxa-13.The coding region of Hoxa-11 does not show a burst of substitutions in most of its coding region during the fin-limb transi? tion. There is, however, an association be? tween the presence of a cluster of Alanine residues in the Hoxa-11 protein and the de? rived expression pattern of Hoxa-11 typical for eu-tetrapods. In the non coding region we find several conserved sequences. One protein binding sequence is found in the in? tron and is conserved between zebra-fish, coelacanth and tetrapods. Another one is found in the 5i non-coding region and shows a clade specific pattern of sequence con? servation and protein binding. This result suggests that it may represent a tetrapod specific enhancer element. The coding re? gion of Hoxa-13 also shows a tendency to acquire Alanine repeats, but in contrast to Hoxa-11 this event is not associated with the fin-limb transition but with the origin of the mammals. We conclude that the com? parison of sequences among fish and tetra? pods reveals several candidate differences that may be involved in major developmen? tal transformations during the evolution of vertebrates. 36.3 CHRISTIANS, J.K., WILLIAMS, T.D. *, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC. Ef? fects of porcine follicle-stimulating hormone on the reproductive performance of female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). It has been suggested that follicle-stimu? lating hormone (FSH) may play a role in egg size/number trade-offs in oviparous verte? brates. We tested this hypothesis in an avian species by administering porcine FSH (pFSH) to intact, captive female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) during egg formation. We predicted that 1) low doses of pFSH would increase yolk deposition and so increase egg mass; 2) higher doses of pFSH would increase the number of ovarian follicles re? cruited into rapid yolk development, and so increase clutch size; and 3) an increase in clutch size at high doses would lead to a reduction in egg size. Although a range of pFSH doses decreased egg mass by ca. 10% in three separate experiments, the re? duction in egg mass occurred in the absence of an increase in clutch size. Porcine FSH actually reduced the number of eggs laid, although only the difference in median clutch size (and not mean clutch size) was statisti? cally significant in two experiments. The re? sults of this study did not support the hypoth? esis that FSH mediates a trade-off between egg size and clutch size in birds. P1.58CHRISTMAN, T.M.*, FINKLER, M.S, Indiana University Kokomo.

Oxygen consumption increased markedly over the course of over? wintering, with a nearly two-fold increase in fed animals. Unfed animals initially had greater rates of oxygen consumptio than did fed animals, but this difference disappeared by the end of overwintering. The triglyceride and glycogen contents of fed animals at the end of overwintering did not differ from those at the beginning of overwintering, whereas both values decreased significantly in unfed animals. Though preliminary, the data sug? gest that winter foraging may be an impor? tant component of the energy budgets of P. cinereus. Moreover, the data highlight changes in metabolic rate during the course of overwintering that may need consideration in estimates of overwintering energy bud? gets.

Cellular dis? tribution of estrogen receptor alpha and beta transcripts in the testis of channel catfish. The cellular distributions of estrogen re? ceptor ALPHA (ER-ALPHA) and ER-BETA in the testis have not been determined and compared in non-mammalian vertebrates. In this study, we examined the cellular distri? butions of ER-ALPHA and ER-BETA RNA in the testis of adult and juvenile channel cat? fish by in-situ hybridization. The cRNA probes used contained 5'-terminal end sequence that is specific for each receptor subtype. Tu? bules in the anterior region of the catfish tes? tis contain the germinal elements, and in the adult fish examined the tubules were sper- matogenic and had free sperm. Hybridiza? tion signal strength (antisense probe) for both receptor subtypes was low in primary sper- matocytes and increased in secondary sper- matocytes and spermatids. The most abun? dant signals for ER-ALPHA and ER-BETA RNA were observed in sperm. The presence of ER transcript in spermatogonia could not be determined since it was difficult to iden? tify these cells in the hybridized tissue sec? tions. Tubules in the posterior region of the catfish testis contain non-germinal colum? nar epithelium, and weak signals for ER- ALPHA and ER-BETA RNA were detected in the vicinity of the apical nuclei. The testes of the juvenile (pre-spermatogenic) catfish examined also showed signals for ER-AL- PHA and ER-BETA RNA, preferentially in the stroma. In conclusion, ER-ALPHA and ER-BETA genes are both transcribed in the catfish testis and in the same cell types. Their transcripts are found preferentially in the germ cells of adult males and in the testicu? lar stroma of juvenile males. Of particular interest is the high level of ER RNA content in sperm. These observations suggest that estrogens play important roles in the regu? lation of testicular physiology and spermato? genesis in channel catfish.

Populations of Fundulus heteroclitus are distributed through a thermal cline along the Atlantic Coast of North America, from New- foundland to Florida. At the northern end of the species range, fish experience average annual temperatures -12 degrees cooler than their southern counterparts. To deter? mine the maximum critical temperature (CT max) of fish from the northern and southern populations, fish were acclimated to com? mon conditions of 20 degrees celcius in the laboratory. These fish were exposed to in? creasing water temperature at a rate of 0.3 degrees per minute until they were unable to maintain their orientation. CT was siq- max ^ nificantly higher in the southern population (p&lt;0.01). To address the molecular basis of this difference, we have cloned and se? quenced the 70 kD heat shock protein and heat shock cognate from both populations. There are several amino acid differences between the two genotypes, which could be functionally important. We have also exam? ined circadian variation in thermal tolerance. In fish held at short-day photoperiod, but at constant temperature, there is a diurnal rhythm in CTmax, with thermal tolerance at noon being significantly higher than early morning and evening values. In contrast, fish held at a long-day photoperiod do not ex? hibit this diurnal rhythm. Values of CT for J max 974 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Gill Na+/H+ antiporters (NHE) in marine fish. The branchial epithelium in marine fish is the main site of acid-base transfers be? tween the extracellular space and the envi? ronment. Na+/H+ exchange proteins (NHE) are thought to contribute to net acid excre? tion in these animals. We have used mo? lecular and biochemical methods to detect these antiporters in the branchial epithelium of two species of fish. 3'/5'-RACE reactions allowed us to clone and sequence for the first time a full length cDNA transcript for an NHE-2-like isoform from the gills of the ma? rine long-horned sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecimspinosus). The open reading frame is approximately 2890 bp in length and has a -57% amino acid homology to the rat NHE-2 isoform with much lower ho? mology at the 3' end. We have previously shown NHE-1 like immunoreactivity in the gills of the sculpin and the seawater adapted mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus). Using Western analysis on gill membrane prepa? rations from fresh and seawater adapted mummichogs, we have now observed pro? teins approximately 80 kDa and 77 kDa in size that are immunoreactive to antibodies made against mammalian NHE-1 (aa 514- 818) and NHE-3 (aa 528-648), respectively. Following exposure of this species to 1 % hypercapnia for one hour, an increase in expression was detected for both NHE-like protein isoforms in seawater adapted ani? mals, while no difference in expression of NHE-1-like proteins could be detected in freshwater adapted fish. We hypothesize that during acidosis, apical gill NHE activity en? hances net H+ transfers to the water in these marine species. Supported by NSF-IBN- 9808141 to JBC and AIMS.

In contrast to the extensively studied hor? monal regulation of Malpighian tubule func? tion, regulation of midgut transport has been largely ignored. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) is perhaps best known among insect transport physiologists as one of a suite of hormones regulating Malpighian tu? bule function. In larval Aedes aegypti, Mal? pighian tubule secretion rates are stimulated by increasing hemolymph 5-HT concentra? tions as ambient salinity increases. First prin? ciples dictate that larvae must coordinate changes in Malpighian tubule secretion rates with selective recovery of water and ions in other regions of the excretory system to re? main in homeostasis as ambient salinity changes. Recent evidence suggests that the midgut is involved in this coordinated regu? lation of hemolymph composition. 5-HT at concentrations known to exist in hemolymph and to stimulate Malpighian tubule transport hyperpolarizes the transepithelial potential of both the anterior and the posterior stom? ach regions. 5-HT regulates different mecha? nisms in the two regions. The actions of 5- HT in anterior stomach are confined to the basal membrane of a subset of cells. The physiological significance of stimulation of midgut and Malpighian tubule function by a single hormone is not yet understood. How? ever, stimulation by 5-HT of both midgut and Malpighian tubule transport provides sup? port for a model in which the actions of mul? tiple systems are coordinated by asingle hor? mone to regulate hemolymph composition. Furthermore, stimulation by 5-HT of midgut and Malpighian tubule transport in response to saline loads in exopterygotes (Rhodnius), and endopterygotes (Aedes), suggests that its primary function as a regulator of hemolymph composition through coordi? nated actions on organ systems tradition- ally considered separately may be very highly conserved among insects. 800-955-1236 ?

Apical surface mor? phology of the stomach region of the larval mosquito midgut. Mature 4th instar larval Aedes aegypti measuring 6.5?0.19 mm in length have a stomach region of 3.3?0.18 mm (N=6).The stomach is clearly differentiated into distinct anterior, transitional and posterior regions (53.0?1.16%, 13.7?1.16%, and 33.3?0% of total stomach length respectively).The ante? rior stomach consists of cells that range from 5.7 to 44.4 mm in diameter (mean 28.6?1.68 mm). These cells are uniform in appearance and show a normal distribution by diameter. They have polygonal, flat apical surfaces with very short microvilli (0.4?0.02 mm). There are no intercellular clefts apparent at the level of SEM, rather the surface of the epithelium is smooth. The most anterior cells of the transitional region are similar in ap? pearance to cells of the preceding anterior stomach region but have microvilli 1.2?0.03 mm in length. Microvillar length increases to 2.3?0.26 mm in the mid-transitional region, and to 4.210.25 mm in the posterior transi? tional region. The mean diameter of transi? tional region cells is 21.011.26 mm.The tran? sitional region cells show a progression to a more rounded apical profile from anterior to posterior. Posterior stomach cells are char? acterized by globular protrusions of the api? cal surface that are separated by relatively deep clefts containing numerous microvilli, that were not observed in other stomach re? gions. Posterior stomach cell diameter is uniformly 19.711.08 mm throughout the an? terior 2/3 of the posterior stomach (N=22) and increases to 26.211.45 mm (N = 8) in the posterior third of the posterior stomach region (P&lt;0.0005). 59.2 CLIFFORD, A.B. *, WITMER, LM, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio University College ofOsteopathicMedicine.The narial anatomy of hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) with respect to other Carnivora. Male hooded seals (Phocidae: Cystophora cristata) have two inflatable de- vices, both of which involve modification of their narial and facial anatomy. 1) An inflat- able integumentary bladder is formed as the elastic and hairy epithelium covering the narial region is inflated following closure of both nostrils. 2) The "red bladder" is formed as a highly elastic portion of the nasal septal mucosa is extruded out one nostril with the contralateral nostril shut. Both devices are used as visual displays, the first year round and the second during the mating season. The unique narial anatomy of adult male hooded seals was studied via CT scanning, dissection, and skeletonization of fresh heads. Comparisons involved similar stud? ies of adult female and juvenile hooded seals, and adults of bearded seals, black bear, and coyote; skulls of other phocid and otariid species were examined. Among the anatomical specializations associated with this functional complex are expansion of the nasal vestibule, retraction of the bony naris, increased elasticity in the narial skin and membranous nasal septum, transformation of the nasal cartilages, elaboration of cer? tain facial muscles that are inconspicuous in outgroups, and changes in numerous bony features. Adult female and juvenile hooded seals are skeletally more like adult males but the associated soft tissues are less developed. Oddly, the mechanism of nostril closure remains enigmatic. The functional anatomy of the hood is important in that it is the nominative attribute of the species; more? over, it has bearing on the general evolution of probosces in mammals and even on in? ferences of similar inflatable narial structures in extinct taxa such as hadrosaurian dino? saurs.

This coin- cides with reduction of endoskeletal out? growth, the presence of an expanded plate adjacent to the probable homologue of the intermedium, and changes in the proportions of proximal fin radials to more closely re- semble the humerus, radius and ulna of primitive, digited, limbs. The earliest limbs date from the uppermost Devonian (360 mya). Of these, the forelimb of Acanthostega is arguably the most primitive. Like other Devonian examples it is polydactylous, but, uniquely, the wrist includes only a single, cylindrical, bone, quite unlike cross-articu- lating wrist and ankle structures of more re? cent limbs. All known primitive hindlimbs include a well ossified ankle, but in the ear? liest examples this includes fewer and larger elements than in more recent, derived, limbs. Functionally, these simple ankles are con? sistent with a likely paddle-like function. The most recent phylogenetic analyses indicate that pentadactyly evolved once, at a node within the tetrapod stem-lineage preceding the divergence of amniotes and lissamphibians. By this point in tetrapod phylogeny, it is also noticeable that markers of muscle insertion areas have moved proxi- mally, corresponding to greater development of the endoskeletal girdles. 18.2 COATES, M.M.*, THOMPSON, S.H., Stanford University. Vision in a cubozoan jel? lyfish. Jellyfish of the class Cubozoa possess camera-type eyes similar to those of cepha- lopods and vertebrates; consisting of a lens, cornea, and retina. The retina is composed of three layers: a sensory layer, a pigmented layer, and a nuclear layer with extending nerve fibers. The cells of the retina are all ciliated primary photoreceptors. These com? plex eyes are located on sensory clubs called rhopalia. Each animal has four rhopalia, and each rhopalium has two camera-type eyes as well as four simple ocelli. In spite of all this visual hardware, little is known of the visual capabilities of these animals and spe? cifically the function of the remarkable com? plex eyes. We want to determine what infor- mation these eyes extract from the environ? ment and how the nervous system processes that information. We are studying these ques? tions using behavioral and electrophysiologi? cal approaches. At Hopkins Marine Station, we have established a colony of Tripedalia cystophora, a small cubozoan from Puerto Rico. These cubomedusae exhibit strong attraction to light. Taking advantage of this behavior, we measured the spectral sensi? tivity curve of the eye and performed wave? length discrimination experiments. We then used extracellular recording methods to measure the electroretinogram (ERG) ofthe complex eye in response to flashes of differ? ent wavelengths and durations. This allowed us to compare the spectral sensitivity of be? havioral responses to the retinal spectral sensitivity and to learn response time char? acteristics. This will help elucidate the type and quality of visual information available to this cubozoan. Funding: NSF and Myers Grant toM.C; NSF toS.T. S1.4 COCROFT, R. B., University of Mis? souri, Columbia.

Loss of feeding larvae in Crepidula (Gastropoda: Calyptraeidae) is not irreversible. It is thought that species of marine inver? tebrates with planktotrophic development commonly give rise to species with direct development. Direct developers often lose the complex morphological characters nec? essary for planktotrophic development and therefore cannot give rise to species with planktotrophic larvae. Here we show that, contrary to expectation, planktotrophic de? velopment in Crepidula fecunda appears to be derived from a direct developing ances? tor, C dilatata. Phylogenetic analysis of 640 basepairs of cytochrome oxidase subunit I mtDNA show that C fecunda nests within a paraphyletic C dilatata and that the three successive sister groups are all species with direct development. The direct developing embryos of C dilatata retain a velum with a functional oposed band ciliary mechanism and a complete gut. These morphological and phylogenetic data both support the sce? nario in which the planktotrophic C fecunda arose from the direct developing C dilatata. 23.5 COMBES, S.A.*, TRIMBLE, A.C, DANIEL, T.L., University of Washington, Se? attle. Spatial profiles of wing stiffness in hawk? moths and dragonflies. Insect flight performance depends strongly on the dynamic geometry of wings. The curvature of the trailing edge, in particu? lar, is a crucial determinant of aerodynamic force generation. In insects, wing curvature results from the instantaneous interaction between aerodynamic forces and bending stiffness. If bending stiffness varies spatially, then regional flow control is possible, sug? gesting a passive mechanism of stability. To examine this structural heterogeneity and its consequences for flight aerodynamics, we characterize spatial variation of wing f lex- ural stiffness in both the spanwise and chordwise direction of insect wings. We measure the surface shape of wings by multiple laser ranging techniques, and then calculate flexural stiffness along the wing by comparing the surface shape of wings be- fore and after loading the tip with a known force. We compare the spatial distribution of wing stiffness in the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, and an aeshnid dragonfly, Aeshna multicolor. These insects, both excellent fli- ers, differ greatly in wing shape and vena? tion pattern. Despite such morphological dif? ferences, we find that the profile of flexural stiffness in the spanwise direction is remark? ably similar in both species, with a peak in stiffness located between 1/3 and 1/2 of wing span, and a sharp drop in stiffness (-2 fold) past this point. In contrast, chordwise stiff? ness differs in the two species; in Manduca, stiffness falls sharply towards the trailing edge, while the dragonfly does not display this abrupt drop. Thus, trailing edge curva? ture and chordwise flow may differ signifi? cantly in these species. 9.3 COOKE SCHREIBER, S.M.*, JURY, S., WATSON, W.H, University of New Hamp? shire, Carribean Marine Research Center, University of New Hampshire. Seasonal dif? ferences in behavioral thermoregulation in the lobster, Homarus americanus. Lobsters in the Great Bay estuary (NH) undergo a seasonal migration, possibly cued by changes in water temperature. Pre? vious work on their thermal preference indi? cated that lobsters gravitate toward a final thermal preferendum slightly above normal summerconditions(Crossinetal., 1998). We conducted avoidance studies, during which lobsters were exposed to increasing tem? peratures (rate of change &lt; 0.2/C/min) until they left their shelters. "Summer-acclimated" lobsters (~15/C) exhibited avoidance re? sponses when the temperature reached -22/C, well above their preferred range of 15-18/C. However, winter lobsters (ambi? ent = ~4/C) exhibited avoidance behaviors at -13.5/C, before the temperature reached their preferred levels. This suggests that avoidance behaviors are initiated by a rela? tive increase in temperature (+7-9/C) rather than by exposure to an absolute tempera? ture. Heart and ventilation rates also showed a linear increase in rate over most of the range of observed estuarine temperatures (Q10 = 1.8, 5-20/C).

We used digital par? ticle image velocimetry to determine how uniform flow fields (2 - 8 cm/s) near the sculpin were altered along a horizontal plane at the level of the trunk lateral line canal. In the absence of the fish and at distances &gt; 2 cm away from the fish, the mean direction and magnitude of the flow field was spatially homogenous at all flow speeds. Small scale (&lt; 5 cm), ambient turbulence was negligible at 2 cm/s, but increasingly more pronounced at higher flow speeds. Flow around the fish's head, pointed upstream, was typical for that around a rigid body and could be predicted by a potential flow model. Flow around the large, extended pectoral fin, pointed down? stream, showed separation at the edge of the fin and a trailing wake, similar to that observed for a flat plate perpendicular to the flow. A separation bubble or recirculating region (1- 2 cm wide) formed behind the pectoral fin and extended along the entire trunk of the fish. The magnitude of the mean, local flow in this region was significantly less than that further away and its direction very close to the fish was likewise very different, predominantly upstream. The shear layer dividing the separation bubble from the ex? ternal flow was fairly stable at 2 cm/s (Re ~ 102), but very unstable and wave-like at 8 cm/s (Re-103). These results show that fish body parts like the pectoral fin can signifi- cantly alter the local hydrodynamic stimulus field to the lateral line relative to ambient water motions only a few centimeters away.

Serotonin (5-HT)levels in the hemolymph of crustaceans has been implied to alter the assertiveness and aggression during social interactions (Huber et al., 1997; Sneddon et al., 2000). Pharmacological examination shows that m-CPP has agonistic functions in crayfish altering sensory drive into the ani? mals ventral nerve cord (Yeh et al., 1996), thus suggesting the presence of one or both 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor types. Based on evidence in other systems, one would sus- pect that chronically sustained 5-HT levels would results in a compensatory negative feed-back regulation and/or that target tis? sues would diminish their sensitivity to high levels of circulating free 5-HT. Altered cellu? lar activity as well the action of agonists or antagonists being bound to a receptor can induce regulation in the levels of functional receptors (Weiner et al., 1989; Kokay and Mercer, 1997; Fone et al., 1998). For example it has been shown that 5-HT1A receptors will demonstrate desensitization when ei? ther an agonist or antagonist is present (Hensler and Truett, 1998). The purpose of our study is to address the issue of up- and down-regulation in the sensitivity of the re? sponsiveness to exogenously applied 5-HT at the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) of crayfish in which the animals have had ei? ther reduced endogenous 5-HT levels by enzymatic inhibition in the synthesis of 5-HT or have had a chronic presence of an ago? nist in their hemolymph. Injections of the 5- HT1 and 5-HT2 vertebrate receptor agonist, m-CPP, for 1 week resulted in a decreased responsiveness to 5-HT. The reduction of systemic 5-HT by injections of p-CPA, which blocks the synthesis of 5-HT, resulted in a supersensitivity of both tonic and phasic NMJs.Funding: NSF grants IBN-9808631 (RLC) &amp; NSF-ILI-DUE 9850907 (RLC). 800-955-1236 ?

Ventilatory accommodation under cold stress in sea- sonally acclimatized black-capped chicka- dees. Black-capped chickadees undergo sea? sonal acclimatization that is characterized by an increase in both basal and summit metabolism in winter birds compared to sum? mer birds. Little is known about how the avian ventilatory system accommodates the large changes in rates of oxgyen consump? tion (V02) between basal (BMR) and sum? mit metabolism (V02sum). We measured ven? tilation and V02 under thermoneutral condi? tions and cold stress in seasonally acclima? tized black-capped chickadees. Cold stress tests were conducted using a gas mixture of 79% helium and 21 % oxygen (helox). Meta? bolic expansibility (V02sum/BMR) was 5.5 in summer and 6.7 in winter. For summer birds, the increase in V02 under cold stress was accommodated mainly by an increase in tidal volume (VT). For winter birds, the increase in V02 under cold stress was accommodated by decreased respiratory frequency, an in? crease in VT and a significant increase in ventilatory oxygen extraction (E02). The win? ter E02 of 68.3% was significantly higher than summer birds (42.5%) and is the high? est value so far documented in birds. There were no other significant differences in ven? tilation between summer and winter birds under thermoneutral or cold stress condi? tions. Our data suggests that changes in E02 are involved with seasonal acclimati? zation to cold in black-capped chickadees. 65.1 CORLEY, LS.*, STRAND, M.R., Uni? versity of Wisconsin, Madison. Regulation of caste fate in the polyembryonic wasp, Copidosoma floridanum. Striking morphological differentiation among individuals structures the complex societies found in insects such as termites, bees, and ants. Castes have also evolved in other insects such as aphids, thrips and poly? embryonic wasps. Copidosoma floridanum is a polyembryonic parasitoid wasp that pro? duces two castes during development from a single egg. Polyembryonic development results in a single brood containing approxi- mately 1000 reproductive larvae that de? velop into adult wasps and 50 precocious larvae that function as soldiers. We exam? ined how the single egg proliferates and re? sponds to environmental factors to produce two castes in C floridanum. We conducted transplantation experiments of wasp em? bryos from all developmental stages into unparasitized hosts from all developmental stages. By transplanting wasp embryos of a particular stage into different host environ? ments, we partitioned the effects of the in? trinsic properties of the embryos from the extrinsic factors (i.e.?the host environment) influencing caste fate. Our results indicate that both intrinsic and host environmental factors affect caste formation in this species. 10.4 COSTA, DP*, GALES, NJ, GOEBEL, M.A., Univ of California, Santa Cruz, Con? servation and Land Management, Western Australi, AMLR National Marine Fisheries Service. The role of physiology in the be? havior of diving mammals. Diving animals offer a unique opportu- nity to study the role physiology in limiting behavior. An important component of the physiological capability of any diving ani? mal is it's aerobic dive limit (ADL). The ADL has only been measured in a few species. The goal of this study was to estimate the aerobic dive limit from measurements of body oxygen stores and at sea metabolism. This calculated ADL was compared to mea? surements of diving behavior of individual animals of three species of otariids, the Ant? arctic fur seal, Arctocephalus gazella, the Australian sea lion, Neophoca cinerea and the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri. Antarctic fur seals dove well within the cADL. In contrast, many individuals of both sea lion species exceeded the cADL. Australian and New Zealand sea lions dove 1.4 times longer than the cADL. The ten? dency to exceed the cADL was correlated with the dive pattern of individual animals. In both Antarctic Fur Seals and Australian sea lions, deeper diving females made longer dives that approached or exceeded the cADL (P &lt; 0.01, r2 = 0.54). Australian and New Zealand sea lions with longer bottom times also exceeded the cADL to a greater de- 980 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

It appears that benthic foraging re? quires these animals to reach or exceed their aerobic dive limit. 14.1 COSTANTIO,D.*, KOZAK, K, LECAUDE, S., ALRUBAIAN, J., DORES, R.M., University of Denver, Colorado. Clon? ing of a proopiomelanocortin cDNA from the pituitary of the urodele amphibian, Aphiuma means. The proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene has been cloned from several anuran am? phibians, however, the organization of this prohormone-coding gene had not been ana? lyzed in a urodele amphibian. A degenerate primer was used to clone and sequence a POMC cDNA from the pituitary of the urodele, Amphiuma means. The cloning strategy in? volved the use of a 3'RACE procedure and a 5'RACE procedure. The open reading frame of the A. means POMC cDNA coded for a 267 amino acid precursor that con? tained the sequences of ALPHA, BETA, and GAMMA MSH, as well as ACTH, and BETA- endorphin. The A. means POMC sequence was aligned to several anuran POMC se? quences including Xenopus laevis, Spea multiplicatus, Rana ridibunda, and Bufo marinus, and to two lungfish POMC se? quences (African and Australian). As ex? pected, cladistic analyses placed the A. means POMC sequence as the sister group to the clade of anuran amphibian POMC se? quences. This project was supported by NSF grant IBN-9810516.

Physiological re? sponses to supercooling and anoxia in the hatchling painted turtle. We investigated physiological responses to supercooling in hatchling painted turtles (Chrysemys picta), which remain in their natal nests over winter. These turtles are freeze tolerant, but also rely on supercool? ing to survive exposure to the lower tem? peratures occurring in nests during winter. We measured whole-body concentrations of lactate, glucose, glycerol, and ATP in turtles chilled for 5 days at 0, -4, or -6?C, or chilled for 19 days at -6? C. In a companion experi? ment we measured metabolite concentra? tions in turtles exposed for 1, 4, or 8 days to an anoxic environment. Chilling and anoxia exposure both resulted in an increase in con? centrations of lactate and glucose, a de? crease in the glycerol concentration, and no change in the ATP pool, suggesting that oxy? gen delivery and/or utilization is impaired in supercooled turtles. Anoxia tolerance may be an important preadaptation for surviving exposure to subzero temperatures in hatchling C. picta.

Cold hardiness and desiccation resistance in hatchling turtles. North American turtles hatch in late sum? mer and spend their first winter either on land or under water. Adaptations for terres? trial overwintering of hatchlings in northern regions, where winter thermal and hydric regimes are harsh, have not been system? atically investigated in many species. We measured intrinsic supercooling capacity, re? sistance to inoculative freezing, and desic? cation resistance in terrestrial and aquatic hibernators indigenous to northern (Terrapene ornata, Chrysemys picta bellii, Kinostemon flavescens, Chelydra serpentina) and southern (C p. dorsalis, Trachemys scripta, Stemotherus odoratus, S. carinatus) locales. Supercooling capacity and inoculation resistance tended to be higher in the terrestrial hibernators, espe? cially C. p. bellii, and terrestrial hibernators better resisted evaporative water loss. Most species tolerated the loss of a modest amount of body water, although some S. carinatus died during desiccation experi? ments. With the possible exception of T ornata, turtles did not regain lost body water from wet soil and immersion in free water was required for rehydration; therefore, des? iccation resistance is an important adapta? tion to terrestrial hibernation.

What comes in must go out: ventricular blood flow patterns in the rainbow trout. Hemodynamic parameters in fish are of? ten measured using invasive techniques, limiting the use of repeated measure experi? mental designs. We used high-resolution (10 MHz) echocardiography, and doppler analy? sis of sagittal images to determine ventricu? lar filling (diastolic) and emptying (systolic) patterns in 3 body-size categories (400- 500g, 600-800g, &gt;1kg, n = 2/category) in hatchery-reared, anesthetized, Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at 14oC. Dop? pler analysis allows determination of both velocity (cm/s) and duration of blood flow (s) through atrioventricular and ventriculobulbar valves. Subtracting end-systolic from end- diastolic volume yielded stroke volume. We calculated flow (ml/s) through valves using stroke volume and diastolic/systolic time. Duration of ventricular systole (mean = 0.41 s, SD = 0.07) was independent of body mass and approximately 2x that of diastole in all individuals. Flow (range = 0.9 - 4.2 ml/s) and blood velocity (range = 67.7 - 120 cm/s) of ventricular systole were approximately 50% that observed in diastole. In summary, de? spite size-dependent changes in stroke vol? ume (range = 0.27 -1.47 ml), the duration of systole and diastole, and heart rate remain relatively constant, suggesting compensa- tory mechanisms are involved in increasing cardiac output with increasing ventricle size. Electrocardiographic (ECG) data collected concurrently with echocardiographic/ doppler imaging will help decipher the rela? tive contribution of both atrial contraction and ventricular relaxation in cardiac blood flow patterns in the growing trout heart. S6.2 COUGHLIN,D.J,Widener University, Chester, PA. A molecular mechanism for variations in muscle function in rainbow trout. Rainbow trout provide an excellent model for the molecular analysis of muscle func- tion. For several years I have studied a de? velopmental shift in muscle kinetics and swimming performance in trout. At the parr- smolt transformation, red or slow-twitch muscle of trout undergoes a shift in contrac? tions kinetics. The red muscle of younger trout parr has faster rates of activation and relaxation in isometric contractions and has a faster maximum shortening velocity (Vmax) than that of older trout smolts. Further, parr swim steadily at higher tailbeat frequencies than smolts. Molecular biological techniques can be used to examine the molecular ba? sis for this developmental shift in muscle function. Because of the observed varia? tions in Vmax, an ontogenetic shift in the muscle protein myosin heavy chain (MHC) may be responsible for changes in muscle kinetics. We examined the MHC protein with SDS-PAGE and through cloning and se? quencing MHC mRNAs. SDS-PAGE re? vealed a significant shift in the pattern of MHC isoforms. Parr red muscle samples typically have 2-3 forms of MHC, while smolt samples have 1-2 forms. Densitometry re? veals a statistical difference in the intensity of MHC bands between the two stages, sug? gesting a developmental reduction in MHC isoforms in trout red muscle. Three MHC mRNAs were subsequently cloned and se? quenced, one each from red, white and ven? tricular muscle. Through the use of isoform- specific primer pairs, RT-PCR was used to determine the expression patterns of these three mRNAs in trout red muscle. Parr red muscle consistently expresses both white and red isoforms, and often the ventricular isoform, of MHC. As compared to parr, a greater proportion of the smolt red muscle samples expressed only the red muscle isoform. A shift in MHC expression provides a mechanism for the ontogenetic change in muscle function in rainbow trout. 26.2 COURTLAND, H. W-. *, WRIGHT, G. M., DEMONT, M.

Morphological and biochemical studies have demonstrated that lamprey cartilages are different from other vertebrate cartilages 982 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="59">in that their major structural components lack collagen and elastin. Notable biochemical and morphological variations even suggest that a family of noncollagenous matrix pro? teins comprises the lamprey's cartilaginous skeleton. Yet, in spite of this knowledge, the mechanical properties of these cartilages re? main a mystery. In order to further our un? derstanding of cartilage structure-function relations, we conducted a series of stress- relaxation experiments on lamprey annular and pericardial cartilages. Strains of up to 15% were applied in compression (annu? lar) and tension (pericardial). The applied strains and measured equilibrium stresses were used to determine the modulus of elas? ticity for these cartilages. Our results dem? onstrate significant differences between the stiffness of lamprey cartilages and other ver? tebrate cartilages (i.e., hyaline articular car? tilage). In addition, there are noticeable dif? ferences in stiffness between the two lam? prey cartilages. 19.2 COWART, J.D., University of Florida, Gainesville. Palatability of Pteraster tesselatus (Echinodermata: Asteroidea) eggs. Risk of offspring mortality is a critical com? ponent of models concerning the ecology and evolution of life history traits in marine invertebrates. In these models, predation is generally assumed to be the most important cause of pre-settlement offspring mortality. Although few studies have directly investi? gated offspring susceptibility to predators, most models evaluating development as? sume that offspring of most species are pal- atable. Pelagic nonfeeding offspring are commonly large, conspicuous, energy rich, produced in small numbers, and lack ap? parent morphological defenses. Interactions between nonfeeding offspring and consum? ers are not well studied. However, recent studies have shown that pelagic nonfeeding offspring may benefit from the production of chemical defenses. This study investigated offspring palatability of the starfish Pteraster tesselatus. Members of the pterasterid fam? ily are unique because the adults secrete mucus over their aboral surface when at- tacked by predators. In addition, most spe- cies of pterasterids brood direct developing offspring within a specialized brood cham? ber called the nidamental chamber. P tesselatus is unique because it has re- evolved pelagic development. The eggs of P tesselatus are large, energy rich, positively buoyant, bright orange, and exposed to pe? lagic predators. I hypothesize that the re-evo- lution of pelagic development resulted in the evolution of chemical defenses in the off? spring of R tesselatus. Preliminary results support this hypothesis by showing that the eggs of P tesselatus are unpalatable to two species of northern pacific fish, Oligocottus maculosus and Gasterosteus aculeatus. 27.6 COX, DE. *, BERTRAM, J.E.A., Florida State University. Hypothesis testing as a lab exercise: a simple walking study. This paper describes a laboratory exer? cise designed to provide students with ex? perience testing a hypothesis by systemati- cally isolating and controlling determinant variables. The study involves the analysis of walking and is performed by the students on a subject from within their lab group. The study requires use of a motorized treadmill, tape measure, stop watch, personal cassette player and calculator. The exercise is de? signed to include factors that the students are familiar with, so they can focus on the isolation of parameters without being con- fused about the process they are investigat- ing. However, the exercise will not turn out as they anticipate, meaning they will be forced to re-evaluate the assumptions that formed the basis of their original hypothesis. This exercise is designed for a college level course in exercise science, physiology or biology, but could easily be managed by a high school honors class with appropriate guidance.

Examina? tion of material preserved by freeze substi? tution shows greater details, i.e. the SL is divided into three sub layers H1, H2, and H3 and has a boundary layer (B), consisting of short fibers which are and associated with its outer surface and project into the CM at right angles to the SL. Development of the HL begins at fertilization when exocytosis of the cortical granules releases ECM into the perivitelline space and elevates the fertili? zation membrane. Shortly after this plaques of dense material with attached fibers are present on the outer surface of the egg plas- malemma. Following this these plaques and fibers are associated with the tips of short microvilli suggesting that they may induce the microvillus formation. Next, the tips of some of the microvilli are joined by short regions of the H1 sub layer. Some of these H1 regions have short segments of bound? ary layer material associated with their outer surfaces while others are naked. Just prior to hatching, the H1 and B layers completely surround the embryo separating the devel? oping CM and IV layers. Short segments of the H2 and H3 sub layers are also begin? ning to appear and extend to surround the embryo. Post hatching, the microvilli and all HL layers increase in thickness and density, particularly the H2, boundary and CM lay? ers. The results suggest a sequential orga? nization of HL components from ECM which is secreted into the perivitelline space.

Sexual dimorphism, cheliped assymetry and selec? tion pressure in Uca spp. Left-right claw asymmetry occurs in a variety of decapod species. The asymme? tries can be present in early development or arise during sexual differentiation. In Uca spp., males have a dimorphic enlargement of one of the two chelipeds. The larger che? liped has been associated with male repro? ductive success as a result of female selec? tion or advantage in male-male combat. Be- cause the enlarged cheliped occurs on ei? ther the right or left side, selection pressure could produce populations with right or left cheliped dominance. To ascertain whether such selection pressure is acting on Uca longisignalis, U. minax, and U. pugnax, populations of fiddler crabs from four North American marshes were sampled; two on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, one on the Chesapeake Bay and one on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. There were no signifi? cant differences in the proportion of right or left enlarged chelipeds within males of all sampled species or within marshes (p&gt;0.05). Similarly, when male crabs were grouped arbitrarily into two major cheliped size classes (equal to or greater than 20 mm and less than 20 mm) the proportion of right or left enlarged cheliped individuals was simi? lar among each of the size groups (p&gt;0.05). Mean major propodus size for males was similar for individuals with either right or left cheliped dominance within each of the three species and four marshes (p&gt;0.05). It ap? pears that among these three species of Uca, there is no selection for males with che? liped enlargement on either the right or left side. 40.1 CROLL, S.L*, WATTS, S.A., Univer? sity of Alabama at Birmingham. The effect of temperature on feeding characteristics in two sympatric crayfish species. Crayfish are an integral component of many freshwater habitats. They often impact the environment through vegetative grazing, burrowing activities, and predation. The red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii (PC), and the white river crayfish, R zonangulus (PZ), are commonly found in the southeast- ern United States and are important in com? mercial culture activities. Because of their ecological and commercial importance throughout these temperate regions, the ef? fects of temperature on feeding characteris? tics and, consequently, production are of in? terest. Consumption of a formulated diet, ap? parent dry matter digestibility (ADMD), and carbohydrate and protein absorption were examined after exposure for 3 weeks at 8, 14, 20,26, or 32 C. Sex-specific differences were generally not found in either species. 984 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Consumption averaged 6 and 7 % body weight per d at 26 C in PC and PZ, respectively, a temperature near their re? ported thermal optimum. Consumption was minimal at 8 C. ADMD ranged from 55-75% regardless of sex, species, temperature, or rate of consumption. Carbohydrate absorp? tion efficiency increased in both species from approximately 20 % to 70 % as temperature increased from 8 to 32 C. In contrast, protein absorption efficiency decreased from 45 % to 5 % as temperature increased from 8 to 32 C. PC and PZ maintain a relatively con? stant consumption rate at a wide range of temperatures, but species-specific differ? ences at high temperatures suggest that PC will have a potential growth advantage. These data suggest further that the protein:energy requirements for these spe? cies change with temperature. P1.90CROSSLEY, D. A.*, BAGATTO, B.

Changes in cardiovascu? lar control mechanisms during the embry? onic development of the American alligator, Alligator mississippiensis. Several ectothermic vertebrates possess a unique cardiac morphology that provides the potential for differential perfusion of sys? temic and pulmonary vasculatures. The crocodilians represent one such group with the capacity to bypass the lungs, returning deoxygenated blood to the systemic tissues (R-L shunt). Numerous studies have inves? tigated cardiovascular function and control in adult crocodilians; however, maturation during embryonic development remains un? known. This study determined changes in cardiovascular function and control during the embryonic development (from 30 to 72 days) of the American alligator. During de? velopment resting cardiovascular function changed markedly, with mean arterial pres? sure rising from approximately 1 kPa half way through incubation to 3 kPa at hatch. Heart rate remained relatively constant over de? velopment rising slightly from 80 to 90 beats per minute. Control mechanisms were com? prised primarily of adrenergic systems with no tonic cholinergic input evident during al? ligator incubation. Baroreflex responses could be elicited initially at 70% of incuba? tion with a progressive rise in sensitivity. Collectively the data suggest that embryonic control of cardiovascular function differs from that known to be present in adult animals. 34.4 CROSSLEY, D. A.*, HICKS, J.

Cardio-respiratory control has been well characterized in numerous endothermic vertebrates, however our understanding of these systems in ectothermic vertebrates remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to thoroughly assess the car? diovascular and pulmonary responses to changes in ambient gas composition in the Savannah monitor, Varanus exanthematicus, in a fasted and fed state. Fasted animals ex? posed to graded hypoxia exhibited a venti? latory response characterized by an in? crease in Ve, Vt, fB. These changes were ac? companied by a fall in arterial P02 and PC02 while arterial pH rose. In addition, hypoxia resulted in a progressive tachycar- dia but blood pressure remained constant. Graded hypercapnia produced an increase in both arterial P02 and PC02 while pH fell during each exposure. These changes were coupled with an elevation in all ventilatory parameters; however, cardiovascular param? eters remained constant. 24 h after ingest- ing a standardized meal, baseline values of all measured parameters rose with the ex? ception of arterial pressure and pH, which remained unchanged. Postprandial expo- sures to both the hypoxic and hypercapnic rEgime produced responses in all measured parameters that were similar to that of the fasted animal. Thus it appears that the con? trol mechanisms are unaffected by feeding in the Savannah monitor. 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Anhydrobiosis ("life without water") is a wide-spread phenomenon in all major groups of lower organisms. Anhydrobiotic organisms often contain as little as 2% wa? ter content. They persist in the dry state for lengthy periods, but when they are returned to water they rapidly rehydrate and resume active metabolism. The mechanisms under? lying their ability to survive in this unique state are becoming well understood; virtu? ally all such organisms produce disaccha- rides at high concentrations, most notably a disaccharide of glucose, trehalose. Treha? lose has the ability to stabilize dry mem? branes and proteins, and, it is emerging, in? tact cells in the absence of water. This stabi? lization involves direct interaction between the sugar and hydrophilic residues in biomolecules, an interaction that confers upon the molecule a physical state that re? sembles the fully hydrated state. This inter? action, which has come to be called the "wa? ter replacement mechanism" appears to be required for the stabilization. Recently, these findings have been applied to mammalian cells, and it is becoming possible to reduce these cells to a dry state, with excellent re? covery, findings that are likely to have appli? cations in clinical medicine. In the dry state, anhydrobiotic organisms show an arrest of metabolism, during which they appear not to age. When the cells are rehydrated, they resume active metabolism, but the life span is not shortened by the length of time spent in anhydrobiosis. The same appears to be true of mammalian cells dried with treha? lose. We suggest that such an effective ex? tension ofthe life span should have profound ecological and philosophical implications. P3.47CROWLEY, M.C*, HATLE, J.D., ANDREWS, A.L, JULIANO, S.A., Illinois State University Inter-population differences in reproductive tactics in lubber grasshop? pers. For many organisms, a trade-off exists between reproductive timing (e.g. age at oviposition) and mass of reproductive out? put (e.g. number of eggs). Within a species, populations could be predicted to exhibit tim- ing vs. output mass trade-offs that are adapted to their local environment. To test this hypothesis, we examined three popula? tions of the clutch-laying grasshopper Romalea microptera. We predicted that grasshoppers from locations with relatively long growing seasons would have greater temporal reproductive plasticity and less plasticity in egg number. In contrast, grass? hoppers from locations with relatively short growing seasons would have greater plas? ticity in egg number and less temporal plas? ticity. We used Florida (FL), Louisiana (LA), and Georgia (GA) hoppers as our long, in? termediate, and short season populations, respectively. We reared three subsets of each population of grasshoppers with high, medium and low amounts of food available. For egg number, within each population, high-fed hoppers laid more eggs than low- fed hoppers. There were no significant dif? ferences in egg number among populations within a treatment. For time to oviposition, within each population, high-fed hoppers laid sooner than low-fed hoppers. In con? trast to egg number, there were significant differences among populations within a treatment for age at oviposition. Both FL and LA medium-fed hoppers laid significantly later than GA medium-fed hoppers. There were no other significant differences among populations within a treatment. These data partly support our prediction that, in the trade-off between reproductive timing and mass output, long season hoppers will ad? just reproductive timing and shorter season hoppers will adjust reproductive mass out? put.

Trajectories of swing movements of stick insects walking on different forms of sub? strates were studied. When walking on an inclined surface, the body is rotated around its long axis such that the vertical axis of the body is held more vertical than the direction perpendicular to the walking plane. A simu? lation shows that sense organs measuring 986 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="63">leg joints are sufficient to explain this be? havior. As a result of body rotation, swing movement trajectories have to be changed. In the downhill legs, the coxa-trochanter joint is more elevated than in the uphill legs. In the uphill legs, the femur-tibia joint is ex? tended more which compensates for the smaller lift in the coxa-trochanter joint, lead? ing to a higher extreme position in the uphill legs. By experimentally changing the start? ing position of a swing movement in vertical direction and in the direction parallel to body long axis, the trajectories cannot be predicted by an earlier hypothesis. A modified network allows for a description of the behavioral re? sults. Swing movements depend on the width of the substrate. Walking on a wide treadwheel leads to different swing trajecto? ries walking on a more narrow one. The con? tribution of the various leg joints is different depending on the substrate, suggesting an economical solution. If one joint is near its upper limit, the parallel neighboring joint may be activated to meet the goal of leg movement (motor equivalence). The form of the swing trajectory depends on the place? ment of the tarsus in the preceding stance. If the tarsus is placed flat on the ground, swing height is larger than when the tarsus grasps around an edge. Transition between differ? ent swing trajectories is not gradual. The form of the trajectory is determined by the current sensory input on a step by step ba? sis. P1.10CUNNINGHAM, S.L*, MARIS, R.C., Mansfield University of Pennsylvania. The employment of mini-biocells for the bioremediation of petroleum-contaminated soil over a two-week period. The potential of petroleum spills pos- sesses a significant threat to the natural en? vironment. Such eminences have prompted the necessity for alternative methods of con- taminated soil treatment. Studies at Mansfield University, over the last seven years, have centered around the breakdown of toxins by naturally-occurring microbes, or bioremediation. Investigations have utilized bacterial growth studies with drying and or? ganic ashing in soil excavated from petro? leum spills, and in artificially-maintained in- ternal biocells. The present study has em? ployed the use of mini-biocells. Six mini- biocells (31 x 17 x 9 cm) were each filled with 1275 g of soil. These biocells were des? ignated into two groups, open or closed, with control, gasoline, and diesel components. The petroleum-containing units were con? taminated with 350 ml of the corresponding fuel. Daily samples were taken over a two week period to examine immediate effects of contamination on the soil ecosystem. Losses due to evaporation were monitored using the open and closed configurations. Obvious changes occurred in the gasoline biocells, unlike the diesel biocells which changed little due to the enhanced complex? ity. Bioremediation has shown to be a viable potential in the clean-up of petroleum-con- taminated soil. P3.8 CUNYUS, V.L., GOMEZ, A. L, JOHNSON, G.

We have used the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique to as? sess the utility of random genomic varia? tion as a taxonomic trait at the Family level and below. We hypothesized that genomic similarity as measured by RAPDs would be greater within families than across fami? lies, and that the variation observed would predict phylogenetic relationships in agreement with traditional assumptions.

Individual green salamanders, Aneides aeneus (N=94) were captured and identi? fied by the unique pattern of black spots on their heads. Individuals were then returned to the rock crevices from which they had been removed. Additional visits were made to the same areas in southeastern Kentucky over a four-year period with 50 animals (53%) being recaptured at least once. These 50 animals were recaptured 111 times, with the majority (96%)located in the same crev? ices in which they were first captured. Among males, larger individuals were recaptured more frequently. Also, larger males occu- pied the same crevices over a longer time than did smaller males. Further, observa? tions of 337 males and 216 females indicate that adult A. aeneus occur singly in rock crev? ices. The spacing of A. aeneus in individual rock crevices and the fidelity of males to spe? cific crevices provides additional evidence for territoriality in this species.

Variation in endurance in the fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus: the effect of temperature, behav? ior, and morphology. We measured the thermal sensitivity of endurance capacity, preferred body tem? peratures, activity body temperatures, and several morphological characteristics of Sceloporus undulatus from Nebraska and Ohio. Overall, S. undulatus from Nebraska had higher endurance than Ohio S. undulatus. Endurance measured over S. undulatus' range of field active body tem? peratures was statistically insensitive to tem? perature. Optimal body temperature for per? formance was statistically higher for the Ne? braska population (mean = 31.26 C versus 29.86 C). Preferred body temperatures of both populations ranged approximately 29- 34 C with a mean of 31.510.1 C. There was no difference between populations in the re? lationship between optimal body tempera? tures and preferred body temperatures. There was also no difference between popu? lations in activity body temperatures (NE mean = 33.7 C; OH mean = 33.3 C). A previ? ous study (Balk and Niewiarowski, 1998) found that S. undulatus from NE had lower maximal sprint speeds than S. undulatus from OH. Endurance and maximal sprint speed therefore appear to tradeoff at the population level between NE and OH. Fur? thermore, adult lizards from NE (high endur? ance, low maximal sprint speed) experience higher rates of mortality than adult lizards from OH (low endurance, high maximal sprint speed). This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that endurance may be more important than maximal sprint speed in es- caping predators, however there is currently no direct evidence to support such an hy? pothesis. More studies are needed to inves? tigate covariation between locomotor per? formance parameters, life history traits and geographic variation in this species. 71.2 D'AMICO, LJ.*, DAVIDOWITZ, G., NIJHOUT, H.F, Duke University, Durham, NC, University of Arizona, Tuscon, Duke University, Durham, NC. Body size evolu? tion in a laboratory strain of Manduca sexta: implications for studies in insect physiology and endocrinology. The tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, has been used as a model organism for the study of insect developmental physiology and endocrinology for more than 30 years. Many of the connections between the growth and the endocrine physiology of the larva were established through a series of exten? sive studies done in the early 1970's. The 988 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="65">present study compares those findings from the 1970's to our current collony when reared under identical conditions. We find that lar? vae are much larger now than in the 1970's, with a corresponding increase in the critical weight of the larvae. The threshold size for determining the final instar has decreased. These changes likely result from evolution? ary processes that occurred while maintain? ing laboratory colonies. Given the use of morphological markers in staging larvae for physiological and endocrine studies, the changes in developmental characteristics highlighted here illustrate the need for in? vestigators to determine if their staging tech? niques rely on relationships originally de? scribed in the 1970's. 50.6 DAHLGREN, T.G., WEINBERG, J.R, HALANYCH, KM.*, Woods Hole Oceano- graphic Institution, National Marine Fisher? ies Service, Woods Hole, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Phylogeography of the ocean quahog (Arctica islandica): in? fluences of paleoclimate on genetic diver? sity and species range. The ocean quahog, Arctica islandica (Linnaeus, 1767), is a commercially impor? tant bivalve found on continental shelves throughout much of the North Atlantic. To assess genetic subdivision in this species, we sequenced 385 nucleotides of the mito? chondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene from 83 specimens collected from 12 localities be? tween September 1998 and July 1999 (based on preliminary data, the Internal Tran? scribed Spacers, ITS, ofthe nuclear ribsomal repeat were not useful). The cyt b data de- limited 11 haplotypes with 0.26% - 8.1% nucleotide difference (coded by 36 variable nucleotide positions) among them. Only 3 haplotypes were detected in 39 specimens collected along the USA coastline, com? pared to 5 haplotypes from 9 Icelandic indi? viduals. The western Atlantic populations ranging from Penobscot Bay (Maine, USA) to southern Virginia showed relatively low diversity and appeared genetically similar in that region. Based on the presence of shared haplotypes, AMOVA analyses, and phylogenetic reconstructions, Icelandic populations appear to be more genetically similar to western Atlantic populations than eastern Atlantic populations. Specimens from the Faroe Islands (n=4) show mixed affinities. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a warm Holocene climatic optimum (circa 7500 BP), and not glacial refugia, shaped the present-day genetic structure in A. islandica. 22.2 DALEY, M.A., CARD, G., BIEWENER, A.A., Harvard University, Cambridge, MA. Effective mechanical advantage of the guinea fowl hindlimb during steady and vari? able speed running. Animals live in an unpredictable environ? ment and rarely move at constant speeds. Thus, muscle function under non-steady conditions (acceleration, deceleration) is a critical component of locomotor system de? sign. Previous studies have suggested that, during steady speed locomotion, muscles function primarily to generate the force re? quired to support body weight. However, it is not understood how these force require? ments change during acceleration and de? celeration. In order to address this, we ex? amined changes in the Effective Mechani? cal Advantage (EMA) of the guinea fowl hindlimb using force platform and high- speed video recordings of the bird running at both steady and varying speeds. Limb EMA, defined as the total muscle force re? quired per unit of ground reaction force, al? lows comparison of muscle force genera? tion requirements during steady running, ac? celeration, and deceleration. We found that under all conditions, the majority of muscle force required to support the body is gener? ated by the knee and ankle extensors, while the hip extensors produce less than 10% of the total force. EMA distribution among the joints changes during acceleration and de? celeration, showing the greatest variation at the knee and ankle. During acceleration, knee extensors produce a greater percent? age of the total muscle force, while during deceleration ankle extensors generate the majority of total muscle force. These changes in EMA likely reflect redistribution of force generation to muscles best suited for the pre? vailing locomotor requirements, allowing more efficient, rapid force generation during 800-955-1236 ?

Hovering insects possess the highest mass-specific metabolic rate ever measured and are therefore an excellent model to study the evolution of metabolic pathways in? volved in energy production. We conducted a survey of the maximal activity of several enzymes as indicators of glycolytic capacity (Hexokinase, Phosphofructokinase), redox balance (Glycerol 3-phosphate dehydroge? nase), and mitochondrial metabolism (Cit- rate synthase, Cytochrome c oxidase) in 19 species (4 genera) of Euglossine bees of varying size (varying from 50 mg to 1 g). A strong negative allometric relationship was observed for the activity of Hexokinase. The slope was similar to that of the oxygen con? sumption rate previously published for 9 species of Euglossine bees, which highlights the importance (maybe high control coeffi? cient) of Hexokinase in these insects. Cit- rate synthase activity was also related to body mass, however, other factors (e.g. phy? logeny) influenced the relationship. We ana? lyzed data using phylogeneticaly indepen? dent contrasts and discuss the metabolic and evolutionary implications of these results.

We are interested in elucidating the sig? nals involved in coordinating urochordate post-larval development. Through sup- pressive PCR subtractions of staged Boltenia villosa larval and juvenile cDNAs, we have isolated transcripts dif? ferentially expressed during urochordate metamorphosis. A transcript homologous to the EGF signaling protein Cornichon was isolated in a subtraction focused on the acquisition of metamorphic compe? tence. We have named this transcript Benjam (Boltenia EGF neighboring/ juxtapositioning/activating? molecule). In situ hybridizations demonstrate that Benjam is differentially expressed in the anterior papillary region of competent Boltenia larvae. Research in the urochor- date Herdmania curvata has demonstrated that the anterior papillary region secretes the EGF protein Hemps, which is both nec? essary and sufficient for the initiation of metamorphosis. Cornichon was first iso? lated in Drosophila where it has a role in regulating the EGF signaling involved in establishing the dorsal/ventral and ante- rior/posterior axis during oogenesis. Re? cent work in yeast has established a role for Cornichon in the directed secretion of targeted vesicles. Our hypothesis is that expression of Benjam acts to potentiate Hemps signaling thereby allowing Boltenia larvae to respond to metamorphic cues. Further research into this role for Benjam in urochordate metamorphic com? petence will provide insight into the func? tion of Cornichon, which has a crucial but undefined role in EGF signaling. Addition? ally, a better understanding of urochordate metamorphosis will provide a foundation for exploring the evolution of metamorpho? sis within the chordates. 64.1 DAVIDSON, B.J.*, MOODY, W., SWALLA, B., University of Washington, Se? attle.

We are investigating the morphological changes occurring during urochordate meta? morphosis and the hormonal/transcriptional signals which coordinate this process. Ini? tially, we have described a series of discrete morphological stages in the tunicate Boltenia villosa during the period of juvenile organ differentiation (the first two weeks af? ter settlement.) These include a clear pat? tern of body-wall muscular differentiation which has been visualized through actin staining. This post-settlement pattern of dif? ferentiation may be coordinated by thyroid 990 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="67">hormones, as TH blockers arrest juveniles early in development and TH levels may rise at the time when juvenile differentiation is initiated. We have also used subtractive hy? bridizations of mRNA expressed at times sur? rounding metamorphosis to investigate the differential transcription of genes which may coordinate metamorphic events. This tech? nique has led to the cloning of a variety of immunological genes which seem to be tran? scribed around the time of settlement. The previously described migration of blood cells across the epidermis into the heamocoel at settlement may be related to this immune response. Careful observations of this mi? gration has led to the detection of a group of mesenchymal cells which migrate through a tube connecting the anterior epidermis to the outside of the juvenile tunic. The func? tion of this extra-somatic migration is cur? rently under investigation. Through the de- tailed investigation of tunicate metamorpho? sis we are hoping to lay the groundwork for a better understanding of life-cycle evolu? tion among the urochordates as well as how tunicate metamorphosis and post larval de? velopment is related to vertebrate embryo? genesis. P2.7804WS, A.P.*, TOBALSKE, B.W., Uni? versity of Portland, OR. Effect of distance on flap-bounding flight performance. Previous studies suggest that flap- bounding does not offer an aerodynamic advantage to birds flying at slow speeds. Therefore, we hypothesized that a bird us? ing this flight style should quickly accelerate after takeoff and maintain or exceed the mini? mum aerodynamically attractive speed for its morphology. To test this idea, we studied wing and body kinematics in zebra finch (Taenopygia guttata) as they flew 2, 6, or 10 m within a flight corridor. Flights were re? corded using high-speed video (250 Hz), and variation in flap-bounding behavior was measured among and within the flight dis? tances. Average horizontal velocity in? creased as total flight distance increased. Our results support our hypothesis for flight distances greater than 2 m; flight speeds near 6 m/s were achieved during the middle of 6- and 10-m flights, and 6 m/s has been sug- gested elsewhere to be the minimum speed that would make flap-bounding aerodynami? cally attractive for a zebra finch. Wingbeat frequency (WBF) and percent time spent flap? ping (%FLAP) varied significantly among subsections of 6- and 10-m flights. How? ever, averaging across entire flights, values for these two variables did not change with total flight distance. Compared to perfor? mance in a closed-section wind tunnel (at a higher altitude), zebra finch in free flight at 6 m/s exhibit lower %FLAP (50.2 vs. 68.7%) and higher WBF (28.5 vs. 24.3 Hz). These differences may be due to tunnel effects, the non-steady nature of relatively short-distance flight, or variation in air density between study locations.

Intertidal organisms live in an environ? ment that has large thermal changes through the course of the tidal cycle. Acorn barnacles are found both on exposed rocks and in tidepools in the rocky intertidal. The thermal factors affecting Balanus glandula and Semibalanus cariosus in these two different intertidal habitats can be approximated from a mathematical heat flux balance model. The heat flux balance can be used to predict which factors most influence the tempera? ture of a barnacle. The heat flux balance for an exposed barnacle on a rock shows that conduction is an important factor in the ab? sence of evaporation. However, evapora- tion becomes the dominant term when it is added to the model under measured field conditions.

To date, two general hypotheses regard- ing the evolutionary origin of forced copula? tion (FC) have been proposed. The first and most widely accepted was proposed by McKinney et al. (1983), who posited that FC 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ? Fax: (703) 790-2672 ? www.SICB.org 991</page><page sequence="68">serves as a secondary reproductive strat? egy for paired males. Although not essential to their argument, the implication is that FC behavior arose as a result of selection for this behavior. The second, proposed by Gowaty &amp; Buschhaus (1999) is the CODE hypothesis for the origin of sexual coercion behavior in birds. They posit that males cre? ate a dangerous and coercive atmosphere for females such that a femalefs only re- course is to solicit protection from a male in exchange for exclusive access to her for re? production. Thus, they propose that sexual coercion arose as a mechanism to ensure female monogamy. It should be noted that these hypotheses are not mutually exclu? sive, as together they argue that FC has evolved as a polygynous male strategy, while at the same time helping to insure female monogamy. Studies presented here of mal- lards (Anas platyrhynchos) under semi-natu- ral conditions lead me to propose a third hypothesis of the origin of FC behavior in waterfowl. That is, FC is an evolutionary epiphenomenon that initially arose because its underlying mechanism, high male test? osterone (T) level, was sexually selected for another reason, namely mate guarding be? havior. Note that this hypothesis posits that selection for mate guarding behavior pre- cedes selection for FC behavior, in direct opposition to the CODE hypothesis. Here I will review the evidence for this hypothesis and its impact on the other two hypotheses. 65.4 DAVIS, G.K*, JARAMILLO, C.A., PATEL, N.H., University of Chicago. Pax group III genes and the evolution of insect pair-rule patterning. We have investigated the expression of homologues of the Drosophila Pax group III (Pglll) genes paired (prd), gooseberry (gsb) and gooseberry-neuro (gsb-n) in short germ insects. During Drosophila embryogenesis, prd acts as one of several pair-rule genes to define the boundaries of future segments via the regulation of segment polarity genes, including gsb. gsb, in turn, regulates gsb-n, a gene expressed later in the developing nervous system. In order to ascertain the role these genes play in the segmentation of short germ insects, we have taken a two- pronged approach. First, we have developed a polyclonal antibody which crossreacts not only to the products of the three fly genes but also to the homologous proteins of other insects. Using this antibody, we show that the embryonic expression of presumptive Pglll orthologues in the flour beetle Tribolium closely mimics the pattern in Drosophila. Second, we have isolated cDNAs of two Pglll orthologues from embryos of the grasshop? per Schistocerca. Using both the cDNAs and the polyclonal antibody, we show that both genes are expressed in ectodermal stripes whose timing and appearance support a role for these genes in both defining and pat? terning segments. After the appearance of stripes of the segment polarity gene engrailed (en), both are expressed in coin- cident stripes of a one-segment periodicity. In a manner reminiscent of gsb and gsb-n, each of these stripes is restricted to the neu- roectoderm and lies just anterior to its corre? sponding en stripe. Prior to the appearance of en, however, one of these genes is ex? pressed in stripes of a two-segment period? icity before maturing into its segmental pat? tern. This early expression is more reminis? cent of prd and provides for the first time evi? dence that pair-rule patterning is a facet of grasshopper segmentation. 8.4 DAVIS, M.C*, SHUBIN, N.H., DAESCHLER, E.B., University of Chicago, University of Chicago, Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadephia. The evolution of the endochondral and dermal skeleton in fins and limbs. The paired appendages of the two major clades of bony fish, actinopterygians and sarcopterygians, are composed of two sepa? rate skeletal units: A proximal endochondral skeleton and a more distal dermal skeleton. The relative contribution of these skeletal components to the fin is one of the key mor? phological differences between ray-finned and lobe-finned designs. Shifts in the pat? tern and development of each of these skel? etal units can affect the function of the ap? pendage as a whole. However, studies of the development of living fish cannot tell the whole story. Fossils reveal intermediate de? velopmental and functional conditions that 992 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="69">would not be predicted from a knowledge of recent taxa alone. Newly discovered fossils of the Devonian sarcopterygian Sauripterus show an extremely limb-like endochondral skeleton that is sandwiched between mas? sive unjointed dermal rays. The endochon? dral elements of Sauripterus correspond in position to both the digits and mesopodium of tetrapods. The biomechanical function of the digit-like elements in Sauripterus is linked with the dermal skeleton; most move? ments of the fin would rely on the function of both skeletal components. This situation dif- fers greatly from that seen in the earliest tet? rapods. Tetrapods lack the dermal rays and, consequently, the digits interact directly with the substrate. Indeed, one of the main shifts in the origin of tetrapods may not be the ori? gin of the autopodial bones, per se, but the loss of the dermal radials. This suggests that the loss of the dermal skeleton in ap? pendage development is correlated with the evolution of mechanisms that patterned pre- existing endochondral elements as an in? dependently varying unit.

Horses prefer to trot at speeds that are the most economical. A possible explana? tion for this preference is at these speeds, muscle fibers are contracting more slowly and functioning more economically. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the lateral head of the tri- ceps, an elbow extensor, shortens less, or more slowly, at preferred trotting speed than at those speeds above and below preferred trotting speed. Muscle length changes were measured using sonomicrometry and ana? lyzed during the portion of stance phase when EMGs indicated the muscle was ac? tive and during which time there was an ex? tensor moment at the elbow. Three Arabian horses (4-7 years old) were trotted at speeds from 2.5-4.5 m/s. Total positive strain (muscle shortening) and average positive strain rate (velocity of muscle shortening) were calcu? lated at each speed. Total positive strain av? eraged 12% and showed no significant re- lationship with speed (R2=0.01, P&gt;0.05). There was a positive linear relationship be? tween speed and average positive strain rate in two of the three horses studied (R2=0.64 and 0.87, P&lt;0.05). This increase in average positive strain rate resulted from a de? creased time of contact. These observations are inconsistent with the proposed hypoth? esis.

Diaphragm muscle development in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Being bom directly into an aquatic en? vironment creates unique challenges for the breathing muscles of neonatal ceta? ceans. Not only must these muscles be active at the instant of birth to allow for gas exchange, but their activities must also be coordinated such that breathing takes place at the surface. Thus, we hypothesize that the breathing muscles of bottlenose dolphins, represented in this study by the diaphragm, will demonstrate adult mor? phologies at birth, as measured by the his? tochemical (myosin ATPase) and bio? chemical activities of their component muscle fibers. The fiber-type profiles of adult (64% slow-twitch) and neonatal (33% slow-twitch) dolphin diaphragms are found to be statistically different (F=48.02, p=0.002, df=5, n=6). In addition, there is a strong positive correlation (R-sq=0.98) between the fiber-type profile (percent slow-twitch fibers) of the dolphin dia? phragm and total body length (TBL), a char? acter that is used as a relative measure of age in dolphins. The results of the bio? chemical analyses support the correlation between fiber-type profile and TBL, dem- onstrating an increase in the expression of slow (type I) myosin heavy chain isoform with increasing body length. Thus, the diaphragms of neonatal dolphins are not well developed at birth (92-132 TBL). However, as the dolphin grows and in? creases its swimming and diving activities, the diaphragm matures and achieves adult morphology. Therefore, unlike dol- 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

The evolution of the motor control of feeding in amphibians. We compared prey capture among sala? manders, frogs and caecilians in a phylo? genetic context to identify major evolution? ary transitions of the motor control of am? phibian feeding. The common ancestor of living amphibians was most likely a preda? tor with a free-living aquatic larval life stage. A combination of visual, olfactory, tactile and lateral line (in water) cues triggered feeding. Suction feeding was used in wa? ter and jaw prehension on land. Feeding kinematics were influenced by both feed- forward and feedback information. The primitive feeding behavior of salamanders most resembles that of this theoretical an? cestor. Derived conditions within sala? manders include 1) the evolution of elabo? rate, visually-controlled tongue protraction correlated with decreased lunging and 2) the reduction of vision in some groups and the concomitant dominance of other senses in triggering and modulating feed? ing. In the common ancestor of frogs, the tongue was short and lunging was neces? sary for prey capture. The visual system dominated other senses in triggering and modulating feeding and ampullary organs were lost, precluding the use of electrical cues. Derived conditions in frogs include 1) the repeated evolution of long tongues with a correlated decreased in lunging and 2) the dominance of olfactory and tactile sensory modalities in many burrowing, termite-eating species. Metamorphosed caecilians still use jaw prehension to cap? ture prey. The ability to form visual images was lost ancestrally, as was the role of vi? sion in feeding. Thus, the extensive varia? tion seen in caecilian feeding kinematics is apparently driven by olfactory and tac- tile cues. Derived conditions among cae? cilians include the apparent use of electri? cal cues during feeding in aquatic species. 46.2 DEMAINTENON, M.J., University of Hawaii, Hilo. Patterns of reproductive sys? tem development in the caenogastropods; systematic and evolutionary implications. The reproductive system is one of the most complex and variable of gastropod or? gan systems, and is often also the last organ system to develop. The level of anatomical variation of the reproductive system, coupled with its late development, renders it an inter? esting system to investigate for evolutionary changes in organogenetic patterns. Patterns of reproductive system organogenesis are compared in several representative caenogastropod species, relative to exist? ing hypotheses of caenogastropod evolu? tion. I am primarily interested in two ques? tions: 1) How much temporal variation do caenogastropod taxa exhibit in the repro? ductive organogenetic sequence; and 2) How are patterns of temporal variation in the organogenetic sequence related to quali? tative variations in adult reproductive anatomy between caenogastropod taxa? Paedomorphotic heterochronic events are thought to be common in gastropod evolu? tion, however this hypothesis has been diffi? cult to test. Comparison of organogenetic se? quences within a phylogenetic framework allows the predominance of different types of heterochronic patterns to be addressed. 27.5 DEMES, B.*, CHIU, J., TRUONG, C, QIN, LARSON, S, SUNY Stony Brook. The role of the primate fibula in weight-bearing of the leg. Among mammals, primates have rela? tively robust fibulae. We investigated the role of the primate fibula in weight-bearing in an in vitro study of the deformation of the two leg bones in a chimpanzee, baboon and human. Three rosette strain gauges were attached around the midshaft of the tibia and fibula in a leg preparation with muscles re? moved, but ligaments and joints intact. The legs were loaded in compression through the knee and ankle joints. The proximal fe? mur was held upside down in a clamp, and 994 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="71">the foot was tied to a plate that was subse? quently loaded with weights. Loading cycles were repeated after cutting of the in- terosseous membrane, the proximal ti- biofibular ligaments, and, ultimately, the fibula. In all three species, the predominant loading regimes for both bones is bending. In general, strains increase in the tibia and decrease in the fibula after cutting of soft tis? sues connecting the two bones. The changes in strain following cutting of the interosseous membrane are insignificant. Cutting of the ligaments has more of an effect. Strains in? crease incrementally and significantly in the tibia when the fibula is cut. In addition, the neutral axis of bending rotates from a mediolateral to a more oblique position. The described changes are more dramatic in the nonhuman primates. In comparison to hu? mans, these species have more robust fibu? lae that are sandwiched beneath a flange of the tibial plateau rather than being attached to the lateral side of the tibia as in humans. These results indicate that the fibula has a significant role in weight-bearing of the leg in primates, that the interosseous membrane is probably unimportant in weight transfer between the two leg bones, and that inter? specific differences in bone size and posi- tioning correlate with the observed strain pattern. SU.3 DENVER, R.J., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Transcriptional regulatory net? works induced by thyroid hormone during metamorphosis of the amphibian central nervous system. Thyroid hormone (T3) induces multiple molecular, biochemical and morphological changes in the tadpole CNS. These changes prepare the animal for the transition from larval to adult life. At the cellular level, T3- induces cell proliferation, death, migration, process-elaboration and differentiation. To? wards understanding the molecular basis forT3 action on the tadpole brain we isolated several genes that are directly regulated by T3 in Xenopus laevis. Ongoing sequence analysis places these genes into 6 general categories: 1) transcription factors, 2) cellu? lar enzymes, 3) structural proteins, 4) cell cycle control proteins, 5) membrane recep- tors, 6) secreted signaling molecules. We analyzed the function of several immediate early genes that code for transcription fac? tors. For example, mRNA for the basic tran? scription element binding protein (BTEB) is strongly induced by T3 in the premetamor- phic tadpole brain. Brain BTEB mRNA level rises during metamorphosis and this rise depends on T3. BTEB mRNA expression in the adult brain is low and generally inde? pendent of T3. The gene is most highly ex? pressed in the subventricular zone of the telencephalon, regions of the diencephalon and deep cellular layers of the tadpole tec? tum. We showed that Xenopus BTEB, like mammalian BTEB, binds to GC rich se? quences and activates transcription from promoters containing multiple GC boxes. BTEB overexpression and misexpression studies in frogs and rodents suggest a role for this protein in neurite outgrowth and branching. This and other T3-inducible tran? scription factors likely play critical roles in the signal transduction pathways leading to the diverse changes in the tadpole CNS dur? ing metamorphosis.

Evolution of the corticotropin-re? leasing hormone signaling system and its role in stress-induced developmental plas? ticity. Post-embryonic development can be strongly influenced by the external environ? ment. Amphibian tadpoles show strong re? sponses to environmental signals, exhibit- ing continuous variation in the timing of meta? morphosis. The most important environmen? tal variable for a tadpole is water availability. We analyzed the ecological and physiologi? cal bases for the timing of metamorphosis in tadpoles exposed to habitat desiccation. Tadpoles of several species have been shown to accelerate metamorphosis when their ponds dry. Our ecological studies sug? gest that tadpoles use special senses to detect deleterious changes in their larval habitat. Habitat desiccation results in the precocious activation of the thyroid and the interrenal axes, the hormones of which drive metamorphosis. Several lines of evidence 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

A role for CRH in regulating the pituitary-thyroid axis in addition to the pitu- itary-adrenal (interrenal) axis has been dem? onstrated in representatives of all vertebrate classes except mammals. The CRH signal is transduced by at least two receptor sub? types and may be modulated by a secreted binding protein. Taken together with ecologi? cal findings, our data suggest that tadpoles can respond adaptively to environmental deterioration by mounting a classical neu? roendocrine stress response. Evolutionary conservation of the role of CRH in mediat- ing developmental plasticity is suggested by recent demonstrations in mammals that CRH of fetal and/or placental origin determines the length of the gestational period and may be involved with precipitating preterm birth.

This study explores the role of hypoglos? sal sensory feedback during feeding in the toad Bufo alvarius. Prior studies indicate that sensory feedback from the hypoglossal nerves can trigger inhibition of both tonic and phasic activity of the jaw levator muscles. Temporary inhibition of the jaw levators al? lows the jaw depressors to produce rapid mouth opening. Following bilateral hypo? glossal transection, the levators and depres? sors fire simultaneously, preventing mouth opening during feeding attempts. Utilizing unilateral rather than bilateral hypoglossal transections, coupled with high-speed digi? tal videography and EMG recordings from the jaw levators and depressors, I have fur? ther investigated hypoglossal feedback con? trol of the anuran jaw musculature. Prelimi? nary data show that while the mouth opens following unilateral transection, the velocity of mouth opening and the maximum gape angle are reduced. These results suggest that transection of the hypoglossal nerve on one side prevents the inhibition of tonic and phasic activity of the jaw levators only on that same side. Hence, on that side of the jaw, the levators and depressors may be fir? ing simultaneously, resisting the efforts of the contralateral depressors to open the mouth and therefore reducing the speed and maxi? mum gape angle of mouth opening. Accord? ing to this scenario, each hypoglossal nerve carries information back to the central ner? vous system in a unilateral fashion. Nerve staining studies are currently being con? ducted to further test this hypothesis. 43.3 DEUFEL, A.*, CUNDALL, D., Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA. Feeding in stiletto snakes. Stiletto snakes (Atractaspis) resemble vipers in having a short maxilla bearing a long fang associated with a large venom gland. Previous studies of Atractaspis have described an unusual envenomation strat? egy in which one fang is unilaterally everted from the closed mouth and stabbed into the prey by a posteroventral jerk of the head. Prior anatomical descrip? tions suggest that the head of Atractaspis is designed for increased cranial kinesis through liberation of both ends of the ptery- goid. We combined video records of A. bibroni feeding on live prey inside a nar? row tunnel with electrical stimulation of anesthetized snakes and dissection of pre? served specimens to show that the appar? ent design for increased cranial kinesis is constrained minimally by maxillary-pre- frontal relationships that limit pterygoid movement. Liberation of the palatine from the pterygoid precludes prey transport using the "pterygoid walk" because of the absence of a palatine protraction mecha? nism. Atractaspis has to rely on a relatively inefficient transport mechanism in which the snake forces its head over the prey with lateral rotations around a vertical axis. As the prey enters the esophagus A. bibroni switches to bilateral head and an? terior trunk extension and compression, a mechanism that can make use of the pa? latine teeth. It remains unresolved how an upper jaw with high kinetic potential of the medial elements could evolve together with a lateral upper jaw with limited kinetic 996 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

Nevertheless, the unusual feed? ing apparatus of Atractaspis appears to be ideally suited for prey capture in small spaces. 54.1 DEVRIES, A.L*, CHENG, C.-H.C, University of Illinois. Freezing avoidance strategies differ in Antarctic and Arctic fishes. Notothenioid fishes in Antarctica freeze at approximately -2.3?C. One de? gree of this freezing point depression is primarily due to NaCl, while the remain? der is due to antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGP) and a recently discovered anti? freeze potentiating protein (AFPP). AFGPs are present in the blood at 30 to 40 mg/ml while AFPP ranges from 2 to 4 mg/ml de? pending on the species of notothenioid. Only the antifreeze activity of the larger AFGPs 1-5 appeared to be potentiated, while the smaller AFGPs 7 and 8 are not. Thus fishes living in very icy shallow wa? ter like Pagothenia borchgrevinki have lower levels of AFGP 1-5 and high levels of AFPP, while Trematomus loennbergiWv- ing at 500 meters where the cold water lacks ice have high levels of AFGP 1-5 and low levels of AFPP. This relationship appears to correlate with depth and the amount of ice in the fishes environment. Arctic gadid fishes have freezing points between -1.9 and -2.1?C in the winter and also have AFGPs similar in size, composi? tion and amount to the notothenioids but they do not have AFPP. There is no evi? dence of any other macromolecular anti? freeze compound and thus the slightly el? evated blood salt concentrations and the AFGPs appear to account for their low freezing points and freezing avoidance. ln contrast, in the Antarctic notothenioids, the combination of elevated salt concentration (250mM), AFGPs and AFPP is responsible for the freezing avoidance. S9.11 DHABHAR, FS, Ohio State Univer? sity. Stress and the augmentation of immune function. Stress may be defined as a sequence of events, that begins with a stimulus (stressor), that is recognized by the brain (stress perception), and which results in the activation of physiologic systems within the body (stress response). Many evolu? tionary selection pressures are stressors, and one of the primary functions of the brain is to perceive stress, warn the body of danger, and enable an organism to re? spond. We hypothesized that under acute conditions, just as the stress response pre- pares the cardiovascular and musculosk? eletal systems for fight or flight, it may also prepare the immune system for challenges (e.g. wounding) which may be imposed by a stressor (e.g. an aggressor). Initial stud? ies showed that acute (2h) stress induced a significant trafficking of immune cells to the skin. Since the skin is an organismfs major protective barrier, we hypothesized that this leukocyte redistribution may serve to enhance skin immunity during acute stress. We tested this hypothesis using the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reac? tion, which mediates resistance to various infectious agents, as a model for skin im? mune function. Acute stress administered immediately before antigen exposure sig? nificantly enhanced skin DTH. Adrenalec- tomy (ADX) eliminated the stress-induced enhancement of DTH while administration of physiological doses of corticosterone and/or epinephrine to ADX animals en? hanced skin DTH in the absence of stress. These studies showed that changes in leu? kocyte distribution and circulating stress hormones are global mediators of the immunoenhancing effects of acute stress. We recently identified gamma interferon as a local cytokine mediator of a stress- induced immunoenhancement. Our results suggest that during acute stress the brain sends preparatory warning signals to the immune system just as it does to other fight/ flight systems of the body.

Previous studies revealed that in this key flight regime maneuvering is saltatory, and involves authoritative use of velocity-gener- ated force asymmetries developed during flapping. The effectiveness of this mecha? nism in maneuvering is largely independent of wing loading; however, low wing loading would result in reduced stability in turbulent conditions. Thus, the quick use of strong aerodynamic forces, as well as the gyro- scopic action of flapping wings are likely im? portant factors for maintaining stability, es? pecially for small, lightly wing-loaded birds. Equally important may be a bird's ability to spare its head from the repeated shocks of saltatory locomotion. Data from x-ray film of magpies in wind tunnels, and light film of pigeons recovering from handler-induced rolls shows that birds isolate their visual and vestibular systems, presumably via cervical reflexes, from the vertical movement and ac? celerations of the body during flapping flight, and the angular movement and accelera? tions occurring during rolling maneuvers. Pi? geons equipped with neck braces that re? duced their head's normal three-hundred degree range-of-rotation to thirty degrees refused to or could not fly; pigeons with head movement restricted to seventy degrees had difficulty maintaining equilibrium and recov? ering from handler-induced banks.The neu? ral integration of visual, vestibular, and prop- rioceptor inputs required for the control of maneuvering and maintenance of straight and level flight has not been extensively studied, although such integration must have been an essential step in the evolution of fully volant species. 22.3 DIAL, KP, University of Montana. On the origin and ontogeny of bird flight: devel? oping wings assist vertical running. Discussions on the origin of avian flight fall into two philosophical camps: arboreal (tree-down) or cursorial (ground-up) hypoth? eses, both of which are dominated by pale- ontological evidence that fails to adequately address logical incremental adaptive stages necessary to achieve fully developed flight mechanics. Here, I present a new model based on novel behavioral and morphologi? cal data obtained during post-hatching de? velopment of precocial gallinaceous birds. This model offers a solution to the impasse of previous scenarios on the origin of avian flight and differs from the traditional cursorial thesis. Daily progress of locomotor perfor? mance (e.g., vertical and horizontal accel? erations of flight and terrestrial locomotion) and morphometrics of wing development (e.g., wing loading, feather growth) of three species (Chukar Partridge, n=10; Japanese Quail, n=10; and Ring-necked Pheasant, n=2) from hatching to adult stage were ob? tained using high-speed video (60-250 Hz) and Doppler radar. To escape being handled, even one-day-old chicks exhibited the following locomotor behavior: they jumped vertically, vigorously beat their feath- erless forelimbs, and surprisingly swung their hind limbs through an are similar to that used during over-ground running. Throughout development partially formed wings develop significant aerodynamic forces that assist the legs. This enables birds to "run vertically" achieving substantial heights against rough surfaces such as rocks, cliffs, and tree trunks. This "Assisted Vertical Running Hypothesis" appears consistent with evidence from fos? sil data and provides incremental adaptive plateaus, as revealed by ontogenetic trajec? tories, necessary to achieve fully developed avian flight mechanics as observed in living species. 51.5 DICKEY, B., University of Kentucky. Prediction and description of interaction pat? terns in social dominance structures. Though social dominance hierarchies have been demonstrated and studied in a wide variety of vertebrate and invertebrate taxa, no models exist that explain or predict which animals should interact aggressively within a hierarchy. Data from empirical stud? ies of social dominance are often presented in matrices that summarize which animal won the interactions between each pair of individuals. Many of these matrices contain identifiable patterns of interactions; for in- stance, interactions may be clustered along the diagonal of the matrix suggesting that individuals prefer to interact with others of 998 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

I present a game theoretic model that predicts this and other patterns, depending on the differences in benefits be? tween different ranks in the hierarchy, and the distribution of traits that signal resource holding potential between individuals. The predicted patterns are then compared to empirical data using a statistical approach that permits comparison of matrices. This comparison improves our understanding of the link between social structure, benefits of rank, and traits that signal resource holding potential in natural groups. S11.10 DICKINSON, M.H, University of California, Berkeley. The structure and func? tion of flight trajectories in freely-flying fruit flies. Without buoyancy or a solid horizontal plane for support, stability is of crucial im? portance to flying animals. Further, for ani? mals that rely on spatially complex sensory cues for food search, mating, or predator avoidance, stability is required not only to keep the locomotor machinery in an appro? priate orientation, but also to keep body os? cillations from contaminating sensory sig? nals. My laboratory has been studying the flight behavior of fruit flies, highly maneu? verable organisms that rely on rapid sen? sory-motor feedback, and not passive mechanisms, for their robust stability. The flight paths of fruit flies consist of straight se? quences interspersed with rapid saccadic turns, during which the animal quickly changes its heading by roughly 90 degrees. While flies are thought to rely heavily on vi? sual feedback in flight control, evidence sug? gests that during the straight flight sequences they fly under the exclusive control of their halteres, mechanosensory structures that act as an inertial guidance system. Since mechanosensory cells are capable of faster response dynamics than photoreceptors, feedback from the halteres can tune the sta? bility reflexes much more sharply than could feedback from the eyes. The saccades ap? pear to represent fixed action patterns, the magnitude of which does not depend upon prior visual experience. The visual system does, however, determine the direction and timing of saccades. During straight flight, the visual system appears to integrate optic ex? pansion, triggering a collision avoidance saccade when the expansion reaches a criti? cal threshold. The role of the straight flight sequences may be to stabilize gaze during this integration process in order to minimize the errors introduced by body oscillations. Thus, the involuntary inertial stability sys? tem may play an important role in voluntary, visually-guided behaviors. 17.2 DINKELACKER, S.A. *, WILSON, T P, HOWARD, J.

Spatial ecology of syntopic bog (Clemmys muhlenbergii), spotted (Clemmys guttata) and snapping (Chelydra serpentina) turtles in Maryland.

I attached radio transmitters to the cara- paces of bog (Clemmys muhlenbergii), spot? ted (Clemmys guttata), and snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) and located each in? dividual twice a week during the summer of 1999. I compared minimum convex poly- gon and adaptive kernel home-range size estimates and average daily movements among species using one-way ANOVA. I plotted all home ranges for each individual of all three species to assess total area used and spatial overlap within and among spe? cies. Spotted turtles had significantly larger home ranges than bog and snapping turtles. Spotted turtles had significantly greater av? erage daily movements than bog turtles but not snapping turtles. Home ranges of bog turtles exhibited the greatest amount of in? traspecific overlap (75.1%) and those of snapping turtles the least (15.4%). Spotted turtles overlapped the majority of the total area used by bog turtles (79.6%) and snap? ping turtles (64.4%). Interestingly, bog turtles only overlapped 19.5%, and snapping turtles only overlapped 8.0% of the total area used by spotted turtles. Comparisons of home- range sizes, avaerage daily movements and spatial overlap among the three species suggest that spotted turtles require more space to suport resource requirements at this site. 800-955-1236 ?

The origin and transformation of catfish (Teleostei: Siluriformes) palatine- maxillary system: an example of adaptive macroevolution. The adaptive value of siluriform barbels in muddy waters dwellers and nocturnal fish is evident and was moreover demon? strated experimentally. The maxillary ones are characterized by their connection to a mobile mechanism, the palatine-maxil- lary system (PMS), which is constituted by the maxillary, the palatine and more or less specialized ligaments and muscles responsible for their movements. Siluriform sister-groups (Gymnotiformes and Characiformes) do not have barbels at all and do not present any structure pre- figuring barbels, particularly the maxillary barbels, which are the only ones present in the most primitive catfishes, the diplomystids. In fact, catfish PMS is based on two basic siluroid synapomorphies: 1) a skeletal uncoupling between the pa? latine bone and the the rest of the suspen- sorium; 2) a muscular uncoupling of the adductor arcus palatini, leading to the dif? ferentiation of the extensor tentaculi muscle, which is associated with the ab? duction of the maxillary barbel. So, unless improbably well preserved fossils would be described in the future, a gap will re? main between the diplomystids and the gymnotiforms and characiforms. However, departing from the Diplomystidae, it seems possible to follow evolutionary lines leading to more specialized PMS types. Our study focus precisely on the evolution of the PMS among catfish. For each mor? phological transformation, the way it was realized is hypothetized and the probable adaptive advantage it brings is analysed.

Gill mitochondria from Geukensia demissa, a marine mussel from high sulfide sediments, exhibit sulfide-supported respi? ration with an ADP/O ratio near one. In vivo, sulfide-mediated gill oxygen consumption is three times higher than control at the same ciliary beat frequency, consistent with a change in mitochondrial ADP/O ratio from 3 to 1, and suggesting a change in substrate use from endogenous carbon to sulfide. Carbon-supported mitochondrial respiration declined incrementally following successive sulfide additions, suggesting possible inhi? bition of endogenous substrate oxidation by endproducts of sulfide metabolism. These numerous endproducts include thiosulfate and sulfite. Although thiosulfate alone had little effect on mitochondrial respiration, sulfite appeared to lower both state 3 and state 4 respiration. Therefore, mitochondrial substrate use may be subject to feedback control by sulfide metabolic endproducts. Supported in part by NSF IBN9219658 and IBN9728409.

The fins of fishes are sophisticated con? trol surfaces that play important roles in sta- bilization and propulsion of the body during locomotion. Despite a century of active in? vestigation into the mechanisms of fin func? tion, there remains one critical area in which progress has been limited: analysis of the physical interaction between the animalis propulsor and the aquatic medium. This pa? per reviews current biomechanical research employing a new flow visualization tech? nique, digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV), adopted from the field of fluid me? chanics. This method allows experimental measurements of water velocity flows in the wake of freely swimming animals, and thereby enables direct investigation of the hallmark of fluid force production (vorticity). Emerging from recent applications of DPIV in research on fish swimming are findings with general significance for the study of aquatic locomotion: (1) DPIV is an effective tool for measuring the reaction forces on swimming animals. From rates of momen? tum transfer and vortex geometry, both the magnitude and orientation of wake forces can be determined to gain insight into the mechanisms of propulsion. (2) Three-dimen? sional analysis of wake flow is critical. Flow patterns in perpendicular sections of the wake reveal a hydrodynamic force balance on steadily swimming fish, a result validat- ing the DPIV approach. (3) Fishes can ad? just the structure and strength of their wake in response to varying locomotor demands. Multiple fins are employed simultaneously and independently to control locomotor force during both unsteady maneuvering and steady swimming across a range of speeds. For future work, DPIV holds considerable promise for illuminating the dynamics of bio? logical fluid flow and for allowing functional interpretation of evolutionary trends in propulsor design. 2.4 DRUCKER, E.G.*, LAUDER, G.V, University of California, Irvine, Harvard Uni? versity, Cambridge, MA. Function of the te? leost dorsal fin: experimental analysis of wake forces in sunfish. A major structural transformation charac? terizing the evolution of teleost fishes is the elaboration of the dorsal fin into anterior spiny and posterior soft-rayed portions. As yet, however, there are no hydrodynamic data on the functions served by these dis? tinct fin surfaces. In order to initiate study of the locomotor repertoire of the teleost dor? sal fin, we examined the wake of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) during steady swimming at low and high speeds, and while turning in response to a visual stimulus. Patterns of water flow within fron- tal-plane sections of the dorsal fin wake were measured using digital particle image velocimetry (5 W laser, 250 Hz video fram- ing rate) and locomotor forces were esti? mated from rates of momentum transfer. For fish 21 cm in length (L), neither the spiny nor soft dorsal fins shed detectable vorticity at 0.5 L/s, indicating that they do not play an active role in propulsion at this low speed. At higher speeds, however, the dorsal fin is re? cruited to supplement locomotor forces ex? erted by the pectoral and caudal fins. At 1.1 L/s, continuous oscillation of the soft dorsal fin introduces paired counterrotating vorti- ces into the wake. The thrust associated with the dorsal finfs momentum jet is on average 24% of the total thrust developed by all fins. During turning maneuvers, the soft dorsal fin exerts laterally oriented forces that ex- ceed thrust forces by a factor of 1.7 on aver? age. The dorsal fin, therefore, plays propul? sive roles both in translating the body dur? ing steady swimming and in exerting torque around the bodyis center of mass during unsteady locomotion. This study documents the ability of teleost fish to use simultaneous, independent action of multiple fins for the control of vorticity and for the modulation of locomotor force. 800-955-1236 ?

It has long been recognized that sciuromorphy, in which the anterior lateral masseter muscle originates from an ex? panded bony plane on the rostral surface of the anterior root of the zygomatic arch, evolved more than one time during the evo? lutionary diversification of rodents. Argu? ments for multiple origins of the sciuromorphic condition are usually based on the necessity of deriving sciuromorphy independently in disparate clades within the Rodentia. However, it is clear that care- ful study of the masticatory apparatus also demonstrates that sciuromorphy in the Sciurids is anatomically different from sciuromorphy in Geomyids. Anatomical study of Aplodontia, the only extant Progtrogomorph, indicates that Aplodontia shares charaters of the jaw musculature with the Sciurids that it does not share with the Geomyids. Examination of early ro? dents also demonstrates that more than one type of sciuromorphy and progtrogomorphy may be found in the fossil record. Oligospermophilus and Cedromus are fossil sciurids that, as de? scribed by Korth and Emry (1991) exhibit a "unique zygomatic structure" in-be- tween sciuromorphy and protro? gomorphy. These specimens clearly have attachment areas for the superfi? cial masseter and lateral masseter simi? lar to those of the Aplodontia/Sc\ur\6 clade. In contrast, the Eocene rodent Sciuravus nitidus, which has been de? scribed as a primitive sciuromorph or protrogomorph (Dawson, 1961), has at? tachment areas for the masseter muscles that are distinctly different from the Aplodontia/Sc\ur\d clade, and more simi? lar to the extant Dipodoids. Thus, anatomi- cally there is more than one kind of sciuromorphy and even more than one kind of protrogomorphy. And classic protrogomorphy, as found in Paramys and Aplodontia, is probably primitive only for Ischyromyids, Sciurids, and Aplodontids.

Using blowhole pneumotachography and video, we examined above-water buccal oscilla? tions in an aquatic turtle, Platysternon megacephalum. In this study, we were able to distinguish between oscillation and venti? lation based on tidal volume and sequence of exhalation and inhalation phases. The mean tidal volume for oscillations was found to be about 1/5 the tidal volume of lung ven? tilation. For ventilation, we recorded expira- tory tidal volumes of 6.251 ?0.85ml air, 5.645 ?0.802 ml air, and 6.523 ?0.829ml air for three individuals respectively. The oscilla- tory tidal volumes recorded were 1.315 ?0.4931 ml air, 1.208 ?0.439 ml air, and 0.953 ?0.569ml air. Oscillations also occur as in- spiration/expiration sequences in contrast to the expiration/inspiration sequence of ventilation. Through simultaneous measure? ment of hyoid depression and airflow, we see a temporal correlation between hyoid movement and airflow during buccal oscil? lations and also a small hyoid depression at the start of respiratory exhalation. In exam? ining the relationship between oscillatory and ventilatory events, preliminary data sug? gest that the two behaviors are independent with no fixed phase relationship. We have found that ventilation often interrupts the ex- piratory phase of oscillation thus overlap? ping the two behaviors. The data show ample variation in the pattern and individual vol? umes of oscillations with periods of large continuous oscillation interspersed with few breaths and periods of smaller oscillation more equally dispersed among breaths. Periods of ventilation only were recorded as well. The variation suggests the possibility of multiple functions of buccal oscillation. 27.2 DUDEK, DM.*, FULL, R.J, University of California, Berkeley. Spring-like behavior of the legs of running insects. The dynamics of many terrestrial organ? isms during running are similar to those of a bouncing spring-mass system. This obser- 1002 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="79">vation has led to the search for spring-like behavior in the tendons of mammals. The dynamics of running cockroaches have been modeled as a spring-mass system, but the location of spring-like elements, if they exist, remains a mystery. Cockroaches have sprawled postures with joint axes oriented vertically resulting in the possibility of a pas? sive, exoskeletal leg spring. Therefore, we determined the mechanical impedance (the time-dependant resistance of a material to deformation) and resilience of the metatho? racic limb of a cockroach (Blaberus discoidalis) using dynamic oscillations. The hind limb was removed and secured in an orientation consistent with that of a running animal. The leg was oscillated in the dorso? ventral direction (orthogonal to the plane of rotation for the joints) and induced forces recorded. The resulting force-displacement relationships were non-linear and similar in many respects to the stress-strain curve for spider legs (Blickhan, 1986). As much as 50% of the energy used to displace the leg was stored as elastic strain energy and re? turned. While the relative importance of vis- cous damping decreased with increasing os? cillation frequency, the impedance of the leg increased up to a frequency of 12 Hz. At fre? quencies above 12 Hz, the impedance of the leg remained constant. Interestingly, the stride frequency of running cockroaches in? creases with speed up to its preferred stride frequency, which is between 10-14 Hz. At faster speeds, stride frequency remains con? stant. Taken together, these results suggest that the effects of passive structures are sig? nificant and could allow the leg to act as a damped spring during locomotion.

The axial and torsional agility of flying animals derives from interactions between aerodynamic force production and the iner? tial resistance of the body to translation and rotation, respectively. Anatomical and allo? metric features of body design thus mediate the rapidity of aerial maneuvers. Both trans- lational and rotational responsiveness to ac- celerations decrease with increased total mass. The relatively heavy wings of volant vertebrates render their wing and body mo? ments of inertia of comparable magnitude. By contrast, insect taxa with the exception of the Lepidoptera possess relatively light wings and correspondingly enjoy a reduc? tion in relative inertial resistance to body ro? tation. In many flying vertebrates, use of the tail facilitates the generation of aerodynamic torques and substantially enhances axial agility. Contrasting with maneuvers, stabil? ity in flight requires force and moment bal- ances that are attained via bilateral symme? try in wingbeat kinematics. All volant ani? mals fly using bilaterally paired appendages, whereas energetic costs of morphological and kinematic asymmetries between con- tralateral wings may be substantial. Geo- metrical constraints on wingbeat kinematics may limit force production and thus flight agility in many behavioral circumstances. Unitary limits to animal flight performance and maneuverability are unlikely, however, given varied and context-specific interac? tions among anatomical, biomechanical, and energetic features of design.

We have previously reported the isola? tion of EcR and RXR gene homologs in the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator. In insects, isoforms for both the EcR and RXR/USP pro? teins have been identified; these isoforms arise from the splicing of alternative A/B do? mains onto common C and E/F domains. Expression studies and mutant analysis strongly suggest that these isoforms have different physiological roles. Detailed analy? ses of the recovered crustacean clones, however, recovered an invariant A/B domain open-reading frame for each gene.

RPAs were con? ducted using limb buds corresponding to limb regeneration stages used in previous studies and were also initiated with ovaries containing oocytes at different periods of oo? genesis. To compare the relative steady-state abundance of A/B domain sequences to common domain sequence, RNAs were hy? bridized to both A/B domain and common domain probes, and the level of protection tritrated against known amounts of full-length sense cRNAs. At several stages examined, the relative level of A/B domain sequence protected is significantly less than common domain; additional bands of lower molecu? lar weight resulting from hybridization to the A/B domain probe are also observed. Simi? lar results were obtained using ovarian tis? sue samples. The difference in the abun? dance of A/B containing transcripts relative to total UpEcR and UpRXR mRNA suggests that alternative processing may produce N B receptor isoforms in Uca, similar to the situation observed in insects. The ovary also represents another potential target tissue for ecdysteroid control. 41.3 DURIE, CJ.*, TURINGAN, R.G., Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne. Relationship between durophagy and feed? ing functional design in marine fishes: in? traspecific variation in ecological morphol? ogy. The relationship between oral jaw bio- mechanics and consumption of hard prey was compared between populations of two perciform and five tetraodontiform species to examine intraspecific ecomorphological variation in marine fishes. Gut content analy? sis revealed that the magnitude of durophagy (feeding on hard-shelled invertebrates, such as crabs and sea urchins) varied between populations of each species. Difference in the relative magnitude of durophagy be? tween populations was associated with in? traspecific differences in key biomechanical properties of the prey-capture and process? ing mechanisms. The more durophagous populations had more massive jaw bones and muscles than conspecifics that con? sumed soft prey. We hypothesize that ma? rine fishes have the ability to alter the devel- opment of their feeding mechanism to match the requirements for capturing and process? ing locally availabe prey-resources at post- recruitment habitats, such as coral reefs and estuaries. 65.5 DWORKIN, I.M.*, LARSEN, E.W, Univeristy of Toronto. Temporal dynamics of the interaction between homothorax and Antennapedia in D melanogaster. The antenna to leg transformations in? duced by dominant alleles of Antennapedia (Antp) have become classic examples of homeotic transformation in D. melanogaster. It has recently been suggested that this trans? formation is due to Antp mediated repres? sion of the homothorax (hth) gene. Loss of hth activity from the antennal imaginal disc results in transformation to leg identity, and results of co-expression of Antp and hth have been interpreted as rescuing the antennal phenotype. While Antp activity in the anten? nal disc does seem to repress hth transcrip? tion, several inconsistencies have lead us to investigate the interactions between these two genes in a more quantitative manner. We have investigated how short pulses of Antp via a heat shock mediated transgene (HS-Antp) induces morphological transfor? mations, and represses hth expression. As well, we have employed a HS-hth transgene to examine the temporal dynamics of res? cue ofthe Antp mediated transformation. Our results indicate that there is only a weak cor? relation between loss of hth expression and morphological transformation. Short pulses of hth appear to be sufficient to induce par? tial rescue of the Antp mediated transforma? tion. These results will be discussed in terms of the presumed roles of hth in the antennal disc.

Eggs were incubated in one of four groups: untreated (i.e. 155 mmHg), or treated with continuous 15% hypoxia during days 1-6 (D1-6), 6-12 (D6-12), or 12-18 (D12-18) with normoxia during the remaining incuba? tion. Metabolism (V02), body mass, hemo? globin (Hb), and hematocrit (Hct) were mea? sured in eggs on days 12 and 18 and in hatchlings. Ability to maintain V02 was mea? sured acutely during a step-wise decrease in P02 from normoxia to hypoxia (55 mmHg). At day 12, V02 from D1-6 and D6-12 popu? lations was significantly lower than untreated eggs. Pcrit in D6-12 eggs was lower than in untreated and D1 -6 eggs. Body mass of day 12 embryos in hypoxia from D6-12 was sig? nificantly lower than in untreated embryos, while Hct and Hb were higher. On day 18, D6-12 eggs had V02 significantly lower than untreated eggs. Body masses of D6-12 and D12-18 eggs were significantly smaller than untreated eggs. Hct and Hb did not differ between treatments. In hatchlings, V02, mass, Hb, and Hct were similar among treat? ments. However, D1-6 and D12-18 eggs produced hatchlings with lower Pcrits than untreated eggs or D6-12 hypoxia exposed eggs. Long term effects of hypoxia on V02 and mass occurred in D6-12 embryos. Dif? ferences in V02 and mass between untreated eggs and D6-12 eggs were observed on day 12 and 18, but disappeared upon hatch? ing.

Gastrula stage embryos of the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana exhibit devel? opmental and metabolic arrest in response to adverse environmental conditions such as anoxia. This arrest is coordinated and profound, indicating a high degree of con? trol at the level of gene expression. Previ? ous studies have shown an arrest during anoxia of protein synthesis and degrada- tion, with concomitant extension of protein half-life, as well as decreased nuclear tran? scription. Mitochondria isolated from these embryos provide an ideal system in which to study mechanisms of transcriptional modu? lation during physiological challenge, includ? ing lack of 02 and the lowered ATP concen? trations and pHj associated with anoxia. For example, mitochondrial half-life can be mea? sured in organello in a way impossible with isolated nuclei. Using dot blots of mtRNA, mitochondria exposed to anoxia in vitro had significantly longer RNA half-lives than did aerobic mitochondria, indicating degrada? tion is arrested by lack of oxygen. In addi? tion, when exposed to anoxic pH( in vitro, an even greater proportion of the mtRNA was present after 6 h than in anoxic samples, demonstrating that the pH decline during anoxia is more important for halting degra? dation than is 02 lack per se. We tested the hypothesis that lack of ATP is a mechanism for halting RNA degradation under anoxia by adding 1 mM ATP in vitro to anoxic mito? chondria and found no increase, suggest? ing that lack of ATP is unlikely to be a causal mechanism. We also developed a nuclease protection assay for new transcription initia? tion events to test whether initiation by iso? lated mitochondria contributes to overall tran? script levels. Preliminary data indicate that this is the case, and that anoxia decreases the amount of de novo initiation. 48.1 EARLS, K.D, American Museum of Natural History. Skeletal diversity and mor? phology in Anseriformes: an explicitly phy? logenetic analysis. Birds are very conservative in their over? all morphology, and yet have diversified across a remarkable spectrum of locomotor behaviors. The associations of morphology with locomotor specializations have been murky, however, due to a lack of resolution within and among many avian clades. While it has been shown in other vertebrate groups that changes in bone shape and strength are often associated with locomotor transi? tions, this has not been clearly demonstrated for birds. To shed light on this problem, I have performed an explicitly phylogenetic analysis of bone morphology in the 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Solar ultravio- let-B radiation does not affect hatching suc? cess of Rana pipiens (northern leopard frog) eggs under natural conditions along a con? tamination gradient. We compared the hatching success of Rana pipiens (northern leopard frog) eggs at field sites located along a known contami? nation gradient in the Green Bay and Fox River ecosystem, Wisconsin, U.S.A. Our in? vestigation was designed to determine whether there were differences in hatching success or incidence of deformities when eggs were covered with shields that trans? mitted different levels of UV-B. We also wanted to determine if UV-B might be acting synergistically with agents in the water to further reduce hatching success and in? crease incidence of deformities at the more contaminated field sites, as indexed by sedi? ment polychlorinatd biphenyl (PCB) and heavy metal levels. One Green Bay pond and one Green Bay wetland site were rela? tively uncontaminated (both &lt;0.025 mg/kg sediment PCB concentration). Another Green Bay wetland site and a Fox River site were relatively more contaminated (3.7 and 3.2 mg/kg sed. PCB cone, respectively). We found significant differences in both hatch? ing success and incidence of deformities between sites in the field, but these differ? ences were not attributable to UV-B. Fur? thermore, there was no relationship between hatching success and level of contamina? tion. These results suggest that leopard frogs, at least at the egg (for hatching suc? cess) and early tadpole (for deformities) stages may not be sensitive to current levels of UV-B radiation even in somewhat polluted environments.

The development of radialized and twinned gastropod embryos and its implication for spiralian development. Establishment of the adult body plan in molluscs requires induction by the blas? tomere 3D during embryogenesis. To under? stand 3D's developmental function, we in- terfered with its specification in the gastro? pod, Tectura scutum, and examined subse? quent development. By incubating embryos in brefeldin-A, a fungal toxin that rapidly and reversibly dissolves the Golgi apparatus, we can temporarily shut down cell-cell commu? nication. Varying either the concentration of brefeldin-A or the timing of treatment resulted in 100% radialized, twinned or normal lar? vae. In absence of 3D, radialized embryos did not establish bilateral cleavage symme? try. Despite this, development closely fol? lowed that of control larvae as they under? went gastrulatation and differentiated adult tissues. As veligers, gastropod larvae are bilaterally symmetric with the dorsal-ventral axis at a right angle to the animal-vegetal axis. In contrast, radialized larvae maintained the quadri-radial symmetry of the embryo, with dorsal-ventral structures occuring in a radial series along the animal-vegetal axis. Twinned embryos shared an animal apical tuft and a vegetal mouth while all other struc? tures developed in duplicate and as mirror images across the animal-vegetal axis. We propose that 3D's developmental function is limited to the establishment of bilateral sym? metry. By breaking the continuity of quadri- radial symmetry against a backdrop of re? gional determinants along the animal-veg? etal axis, 3D's signal enables previously equivalent blastomeres to establish identi? ties. The adult body plan then arises over the course of gastrulation by a process of progressive induction, the product of de novo interactions resulting from stereotypic, cell lineage-defined gastrulation movements. 1006 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

From 1968 to 1992, basic science in the United States experienced an economic condition so pervasive and significant that it was rarely acknowledged to occur. During this period, "grant overhead," or the requested percent by which a grant budget was in? creased, was not limited to any specific amount, but rather was negotiated annually with no set limit. The requested amounts rap? idly increased from a maximum of 20% to in some cases over 80%. Neither the neces? sary paperwork (e.g. Circular A-21) nor the Department of Health and Human Services were then equipped for this degree of nego- tiation, and by the early 1980s these monies had become an important source of operat? ing funds for university administrations. Fac? ulty hiring and success reflected these pri- orities, and the ability to generate overhead funds became a central factor of academic life. Most significantly, the administrative pri- orities had become internalized by faculty as values. This presents a remarkable ex? ample of cultural evolution, using funds as a marker of energy: during this period, a para? site-host system operated up to and includ? ing the modification of the host's behavior in favor of parasite vigor. I present both the mechanics and the impact of this system on ourselves as academics and scientists, in? cluding aspects of teaching, hypothesis test? ing, mentoring, and status. Also, Congres- sional hearings in 1992 have led to an im? portant change in the system, such that ad? ministrative overhead is limited to 26%. This change is beginning to affect academia and its grant-oriented practices. I present an out? line of the relevant concerns and issues. P2.2S EDWARDS, D.D., University of Evans- ville. Increased fluctuating asymmetry among chironomid midges in response to ectopara- sitic water mites: implications for fluctuating asymmetry theory. The larvae of most species of water mites must undergo a brief parasitic phase with insects to complete their life cycle. Several studies have found a significant correlation between mite load and the degree of fluctu- ating asymmetry (FA) host characters, sug? gesting that mites increase FA through their effect on developmental stability. To date, FA primarily has been reported among hemi- metabolous insects that become infested during pupal ontogeny. Holometabolous in? sects that are parasitized by mites when they are adults are not expected to exhibit FA be? cause they are infested once they have com? pleted development. Parasitic associations between the water mite Unionicola foili and the holometabolous midge Chironomus tentans were established in the laboratory and revealed that FA of forewing length was significantly greater in infected than in uninfected midges. These results are incon- sistent with the initial prediction, suggesting there are other mechanisms by which larval mites may affect FA of host midges. Behav? ioral observations revealed that the pres? ence of mite larvae induced an increase in antiparasitic behavior by pupal C. tentans. Because antiparasitic behavior id assumed to be extremely time consuming and ener? getically expensive, it may be expected to have an affect on the developmental stabil? ity of midges and thus increase the degree ofFA. 18.3 EDWARDS, DR.*, WOODIN, S.A., University of South Carolina, Columbia. Should worms of a feather stink together? The effects of prey density and aggregation on predator deterrence. Halogenated hydrocarbons are wide? spread among hemichordates and polycha? etes in temperate sedimentary environments. The bromophenols produced by some larger (&gt;3cm in length) macroinfauna act as predator deterrents. However, many of the infaunal organohaline producers are small (&lt;1cm in length), especially in relation to the bite size of their common predators. The ability of these small organisms to deter predators may be dependent not only on the production of deterrent compounds by individuals, but on the structure of the sur? rounding community. In this study, we ex? amine whether patches of small individuals with such compounds are less palatable to infaunal predators than patches of individu? als without, and whether deterrence is de- 800-955-1236 ?

Spot (Leiostomus xanthurus), mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus) and grass shrimp (Paleomonetes sp.) were offered patches of small (1-2 mm3) cubes of surimi with and without bromophenols.

Results of these choice experiments demonstrate that, at least for some predators, bromophenols are effec? tive predator deterrents for small prey, and that this effect increases with density and aggregation.

We increased rolling moments and de? creased negative metacentric heights of spiny rayed Lepomis macrochirus (bluegill) and soft rayed Semotilus atromaculotus (creek chub) by attaching weights and floats which, together, were neutrally buoyant. Weight and buoyant force were normalized by fish mass, and moment arms and meta- centric heights by volumei/3. Fish behav? ioral responses used to counteract the dis? turbance were observed in conditions that restricted swimming and in conditions that allowed free swimming. Threshold re? sponses were defined when a disturbance first caused fish to roll 9# (the limit of initial stability) and when fish were not able to right themselves (the limit of ultimate stability). When swimming was restricted, initial sta? bility was greater for chub than bluegill. When conditions allowed free swimming, initial stability was similar for both species. Ultimate stability was similar for both spe? cies irrespective of whether swimming was restricted. P3.55ELF, PK*, FIVIZZANI, A.J., University of North Dakota.

Fast muscle func? tion in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla, L.) during aquatic and terrestrial locomotion. Eels are capable both of locomotion in water and on land using undulations of the body axis, powered by the lateral muscula? ture. Differences in kinematics and the un? derlying patterns of fast muscle activation are apparent between locomotion in these two environments. Fast muscle power out- puts were measured using the work loop technique, under conditions that simulated their use during aquatic and terrestrial loco? motion. The muscle strain and stimulation parameters associated with swimming gen? erated greater force and power than those associated with terrestrial crawling. This de? crease in muscle performance may occur because on land the eel is constrained to a particular kinematic pattern in order to pro? duce thrust against an underlying substrate. Muscle properties changed along the body axis as reported in other teleost fish. Maxi? mum power outputs using optimal strain and stimulation parameters were 17.3 ? 1.3 Wkg 1 in muscle from 0.45 BL (body lengths from the snout) and 16.3 ? 1.5 Wkg1 in muscle from 0.75 BL.

Slow muscle power output of yellow- and silver-phase European eels (Anguilla anguilla, L.): changes in muscle performance prior to mi? gration. The European eel (Anguilla anguilla, L.) has a complex life cycle involving a lengthy spawning migration. The differences in the locomotory demands on different life history stages are considerable. Eels swim in the anguilliform mode in which muscle function has been assumed to be relatively uniform along the body axis relative to other teleosts. The work loop technique was used to deter? mine slow muscle power outputs in yellow (non-migratory) and silver (migratory) life history phases. Swimming kinematics of the two phases were also measured for com? parison. Maximum slow muscle power out? puts under approximated in vivo conditions were 0.24 Wkg1 in yellow-phase eel and 0.74 Wkg1 in silver-phase eel. Power output peaked at cycle frequencies of 0.23 to 0.8 Hz. Muscle activation (Ta) and relaxation (T^) times were greater in yellow- than in silver- phase eels. Differences in swimming kine? matics and the frequency distribution of tailbeat frequency at a swimming speed of 0.40 BLs1 suggested differences in under? lying patterns of muscle recruitment between the two life history phases.

Literature in this area suggests that preda- tion/competition may be a significant struc? turing force for infracommunities in certain marine prosobranchs, but not others, and that temporal/spatial factors may be involved as structuring forces in at least some fresh? water pulmonates. These, and other, issues will be discussed. 67.3 ESPINOZA, N.R., Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge. Effects of develop? mental temperature on musculoskeletal growth and jumping performance in the treefrog Hyla chrysoscelis. Several vertebrate species have shown ontogenetic adjustments in the form and material properties of the growing muscu? loskeletal system to allow the same level of locomotor performance in juveniles and adults. The rate of growth and amount of time the musculoskeletal system has to de? velop may affect the amount of compensa? tory change needed to produce the same level of performance; for example, the faster the growth rate and/or the shorter the amount of time for development, the greater the need for these adjustments. To test these predic? tions, individuals of Hyla chrysoscelis were raised at 28/C and 18/C to evaluate the effects of developmental duration and growth rate on bone and muscle morphology, bone material properties, and jumping perfor? mance. Although two-fold differences in de? velopmental duration and larval growth rates were found between frogs raised at 28/C and 18/C, little or no difference was found in hind limb morphology, bone shape, bone mineral content, bone material properties, relative muscle mass or jumping perfor? mance at the end of metamorphosis. How? ever, during the first nine weeks of post-meta? morphic growth in both groups, absolute jumping performance, relative proportion of hind limb muscle mass, and bone material properties changed with age. These results suggest that an increase in the relative pro? portion of hind limb muscle mass, as well as an increase in the strength and stiffness of the hind limb skeleton, contribute to the im? provement of jumping performance during post-metamorphic growth.

Precise descriptions of behavior are key to understanding the role of morphology in the evolution of novel locomotor modes. While a number of studies have compared morphological variation among gliding and nongliding forms, there is currently a lack of insight into the extent of variation among lo? comotor behaviors. This has led to ques? tions concerning the degree of specializa- 1010 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="87">tion necessary for gliding versus nongliding (leaping) locomotion. In order to address this concern I examined takeoff kinematics in a gliding arboreal sciurid (Glaucomys volans) and two nongliding relatives (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, Tamias striatus). Animals were filmed launching from a 1.5- meter horizontal platform with high-speed video at 240 frames/second in lateral and dorsal views. Landmarks were digitized on the limbs, tail, and body and converted into 3D coordinates. Locomotor behavior was examined by generating kinematic profiles of angular motion at the limb joints and tail. Comparisons among the three taxa revealed similarities in the majority of kinematic pa? rameters, indicating that takeoff behavior in these arboreal rodents is relatively conser? vative. Furthermore, the presumed evolu? tionary transition from leaping to gliding likely did not involve substantial changes related to the takeoff phase of locomotion.

Endosymbiotic dinoflagellates of cnidarians are encased in multiple mem? branes, causing difficulty in acquiring inor? ganic carbon for photosynthesis. Host car? bonic anhydrase(CA), which catalyses the reversible dehydration of HC03-, can sup? ply endosymbionts with unlimited C02 by accessing the large HC03- pool in seawater. Bell tissue from Cassiopea xamachana, was examined to determine if the localization and induction of CA activity were correlated with the density and location of zooxanthellae. Symbiotic and regenerated recolonized Cxamachana bell tissue had 5 times and 1.7 times, respectively, greater CA activity than aposymbiotic native and regenerated tissue. Symbiotic native and recolonized tis? sue contained respectively, 3 and 6 fold greater algal populations than aposymbiotic tissues. The oral epithelial layer, which re? ceives more intense sunlight, had 1.2 greater CA activity and 5 times the algae than abo? ral. CA localized using the fluorescent in? hibitor 5-dimethylaminonapthalene-1 -sul- fonamide (DNSA), revealed symbiotic and oral epithelial tissues 1.5 times brighter than aposymbiotic and aboral tissues. CA activity and algal density in symbiotic and aposymbiotic animals were highest at the bell edge and Iowest near the manubrium. Thus, the postion and density of algal popu? lations are positively correlated with CA con? centration and location. Symbiotic C. xamachana incubated in the Photosystem I inhibitor, 3-(3,4 dichlorophenyl)-1,1 - dimethylurea (DCMU)showed a 1.7 fold de? crease in CA activity after five days. Thus, not only algal density, but also photosyn? thetic rate determines CA concentration. S10.10 FAETH, S.H., Arizona State Univer? sity, Tempe. Fungal endophytes and host plant symbioses: mutualism, neutralism, or antagonism? Systemic endophytic fungi are thought to interact mutualistically with their host grasses mainly by increasing resistance to herbi? vores via alkaloids, as well as by increasing drought resistance, germination success, competitive abilities and deterring seed pathogens and predators. However, anti- herbivore effects have been documented only for a relatively few grasses, mostly ag- ronomic ones, and mostly on non-native herbivores. There are few studies of the in? teraction of endophytes in native grass popu? lations and communities. I show that rela? tively few native grasses infected with sys? temic endophytes have strong negative ef? fects on either invertebrate or vertebrate her? bivores. Observational and experimental studies of Neotyphodium-MecXed Arizona fescue, a widespread and native grass, dem? onstrate a general lack of herbivore resis? tance. In field and greenhouse experiments, infected seeds show reduced germination success and increased susceptibility to fun? gal pathogens. The only positive effects of the endophyte appear to involve increased rates of plant growth, but only under specific environmental conditions and only with cer? tain plant genotypes. I propose that the mu? tualism between endophytes and host grasses is conditional based upon plant and fungal genotype, which influence alkaloid production, and environmental factors. 800-955-1236 ?

Myocardial oxygenation and the evolution of the vertebrate cardiopulmonary system. For many vertebrates, there are no other normal stresses to which the cardiopulmo? nary system is exposed that come close to the extreme stresses of heavy exercise. Hence it is expected that the demands of exercise have exerted strong selection pres? sures on the evolution of vertebrate cardiop? ulmonary system. I have been examining the importance of air-breathing during exer? cise in several fishes as a potential mecha? nism of myocardial oxygenation. Similarly, I have been investigating the importance of the intracardiac shunt of reptiles in myocar? dial oxygenation during exercise. This re? search has employed a variety of techniques (ECG, blood gas, blood pressure, and blood flow measurements). Although preliminary, my findings suggest that myocardial oxygen? ation is not adequate in some air-breathing fishes when exercising in well oxygenated water but denied access to air. Furthermore, when the potential benefits to myocardial oxygenation of the intracardiac shunt are re? moved by exercising turtles under hypoxic conditions, cardiac function is perturbed. Hence, the necessity of an adequate supply of oxygen to the heart during activity may have influenced the evolution of the verte? brate lung and the intracardiac shunt.

In North Carolina's Cape Fear River es? tuary, juvenile blue crabs are often found in sand and mud habitats far beyond the mouth of the estuary. Predators, prey availability or other factors, may drive the crabs' invasion of the low salinity portions of the estuary. We also expected that there would be conse? quences on the growth rates of these juve? nile blue crabs. We collected small (8-22 mm) juvenile crabs at the mouth of the estu? ary and monitored their growth over several molt cycles in a controlled lab environment. The smallest blue crabs had the largest growth rates, these rates slowed as the crabs increased in size. Crabs growing at three different salinities had about equal growth rates, and equal molt cycle durations, but significant differences in the number of molts completed. It appears that low salinity areas are suitable for rapid crab growth, when other factors are controlled.

Distribution of scales in polynoid scale- worms (Annelida, Polychaeta). Polynoids have some of the dorsal cirri replaced by flattened scales (elytrae) more or less covering the body. An overview of the type species of most genera of the family demonstrated a few interesting patterns. Species with less than 12 pairs of elytrae all have less than 30 segments and are found in deep water, either pelagically or associ? ated with hot vents. These taxa appear to belong to several different clades. The first 12 pair of elytrae are always on segments 2, 4, 5, 7, 9,11,13,15,17,19, 21 and 23. The next three pairs of elytrae are usually either on segments 25, 27 and 29 or on segments 26, 29 and 32; the latter is by far the most frequent and a very large number of polynoid taxa have 15 pairs of elytrae with this distri? bution. Most taxa with 15 pairs of elytrae con? sist of less than 40-45 segments; but a few long-bodied taxa with as many as 100 seg? ments lack elytrae on the posterior half of the body. When more than 15 pairs of elytrae are present, the distribution on segments 30- 45 is often irregular and variable, except in taxa with 18 pairs of elytrae in which pat? terns corresponding either to the 25, 27, 29 or the 26, 29, 32 patterns are present. In long-bodied taxa with 50 or more segments, the distribution stabilizes in most taxa into two patterns with the elytrae present on ei? ther every second or every third segment, corresponding to the patterns seen on seg? ments 24-32. In many species the two last pairs of elytrae are on consecutive segments no matter what the previous distribution were. The distribution of the elytrae corre? lates better with the numbers of segments present than with the length of the speci? mens.

Methods for overcoming the constraints of long range telemetry of bio? logical information from animals: getting more useful data from small packages. Many species carry out their most inter? esting activities where they can not be ob? served or monitored. Marine mammals are perhaps extreme in this group, accomplish- ing their most astounding activities both dis? tant from land and deep in the sea. Coliec? tion, storage and transmission of data about these activities are constrained by the en? ergy requirements and size of the recording loggers and transmitters. The more bits of information collected, stored and transmit? ted, the more battery is required and the larger the tag must be. We therefore need to be selective about the information we collect, while maintaining detail and fidelity. To ac- complish this in the study of marine mam? mals, we have designed "intelligent" data logger/transmitters that provide context- driven data compression, data relay, and au- tomated data base storage. We later com? bine these data with remotely sensed envi? ronmental information and other oceano? graphic data sets to recreate the environ? mental context for the animal's activity, and we display the combined data using com? puter animation techniques. In this way, the system can provide near real time "observa? tion" of animal behaviour and physiology from the remotest parts on the globe. To il? lustrate the approach, we will present ex? amples of its use in southern elephant seals and beluga whales from the polar seas. S5 FEDER, M.E., University of Chicago.

Fish ex? posed to estrogen for 8 weeks produced VTG throughout the exposure period. When exposed to ANT alone fish did not produce VTG. Regardless of dose or exposure dura? tion, ANT did not prevent the production of vitellogenin in co-exposed fish. Because anthracene was unable to block the produc? tion of vitellogenin, it is unlikely that its anti- estrogenic effects are mediated through the E2 receptor. SSAOFERRY-GRAHAM, LA.*, WAIN? WRIGHT, PC, University of California Davis, University of California Davis of California Davis. Using functional morphology to test general ecological theory. Even before Hutchinson defined what he coined the efundamental nichei, research? ers have been striving to understand what it is that makes species different, and what al? lows them to survive in the time and space that they do. Since that time, many theories have been advanced which encompass an array of ecological, evolutionary, mathemati? cal, and simply logical principles. The goal has been to develop ecological theories that can, among other things, make specific and robust predictions about how and where or? ganisms should live. An often underesti- mated or unexplored parameter of these models is the role of the organismsi func? tional morphology. A more complete under? standing of how the features of an organismis anatomy work to allow the organism to ac- complish certain tasks has allowed us to re- visit some of these models from an enlight- ened perspective. We use kinematic stud? ies of prey capture in several types of fishes as model systems to generate and test pre? dictions related to diet specialization and breadth. These include, but are not neces? sarily limited to, predictions regarding why an organism might specialize, and the po? tential ecological and evolutionary conse? quences of specialization. We also consider several definitions of specialization and at- tempt to align these based upon shared eco? logical and evolutionary principles. We note that not all functional morphological systems are ideal for testing ecological models, as many ecological models depend on other levels of organismal design for predicting community patterns (i.e., behavior or sen? sory biology). We attempt to identify and define the characteristics of those certain functional morphological systems that make them useful for testing general ecological models and lead to robust predictions. S3.11FETCHO, J.R., SUNYat Stony Brook. New approaches to the function of neuronal circuits that might simplify (a little) studies of the evolution of behavior. Understanding motor patterns (elec- tromyograms) and their evolution requires understanding the neuronal circuits that pro? duce them and the evolutionary changes in those circuits. This is not easy, which is per? haps why there are not many explicitly com? parative studies of the functional organiza? tion of motor circuits for feeding or other ver? tebrate behaviors. Simply identifying which neurons are involved in a particular behav? ior in even one species is a challenge and doing this in a comparative way has been unrealistic. The problem is even more com- plicated because over the last decade neu- robiological studies have shown how plas? tic the nervous system really is. Changes in motor output, even within a single animal, can occur in many ways, including changes in synaptic connections, alterations in ion channel expression in neurons, or a restruc- turing of the function of neuronal circuits by neuromodulators. The challenge is to de? velop techniques that are easily applicable across species which allow one to identify 1014 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Such approaches would then allow for comparative studies of motor cir? cuits in animals with differing motor patterns. We have been applying optical methods and fluorescent indicators to image which neu? rons are active during behavior of larval fish and to reconstruct their morphology in the live animal. In addition, we have developed approaches to laser kill neurons to test their function in vivo. These approaches, com? bined with powerful new genetic tools for fluorescently labeling neurons, should al? low a more ready attack on the problems of exactly what the motor circuitry is for behav? iors such as feeding and how it has changed in conjunction with the evolution of new motor patterns. 49.4 FILORAMO, Nl.*, SCHWENK, K, University of Connecticut. Ultrastructure of the lingual surface in anguimorph lizards and snakes: evolutionary and functional im? plications. ln squamates, one of the tongue's roles is to collect chemicals from the environment. Both volatile and non-volatile chemicals are delivered to the vomeronasal chemosen? sory organs (VNOs). The information gained from these chemicals allows squamates to find and identify mates and prey items. Given the tongue's central role in delivering chemi? cals to the VNOs, understanding the surface topology of the tongue and how it might af? fect the tongue's ability to retrieve environ? mental chemicals and deliver them to the VNOs is of high import. This study focuses on anguimorph lizards and snakes, whose tongues have become highly modified for their role in chemoreception. Snakes are widely believed to have evolved from within the Anguimorpha. Both scanning and trans? mission electron microscopy where em? ployed. The surface topology of the forked region of the tongue (the tines) differs from that of posterior, unforked region of the tongue in all specimens investigated to date. The surface topology of the tines in snakes differs significantly from those of anguimorph lizards. In snakes, the tine surfaces are cov? ered with microfacets. However, in most anguimorph lizards both the dorsal and ven? tral surfaces are covered depressions and the ventral surfaces have scattered small or "incipient" microfacets. Helodermatids are an exception in that instead of scattered in? cipient microfacets on the ventral surfaces of the tines there are clusters of larger, snake- like, microfacets. Ultrastructural features sug? gest that the deeply forked tongues of snakes and varanids were derived independently. Biomechanical evidence suggests that ul? trastructural differences may be unrelated to function.

We investigated differences in metabo? lism and locomotor performance of male and female spotted salamanders collected dur? ing the breeding season. Male salamanders had faster voluntary crawling speeds than did females (both gravid and non-gravid). Burst swimming velocity was higher in males than in gravid females, but there was no dif? ference in burst crawling speeds between the sexes. Oxygen consumption was greater in females both during rest and during loco? motion at the voluntary crawling speed of gravid females. Both male and nongravid females sustained locomotion longer than did gravid females. These findings suggest differences in locomotor performance and energetics that may account for observed differences in arrival times at breeding sites and survival between male and female mole salamanders. 60.3 FISH, F.E., FRAPPELL, P.B., BAUDINETTE, R.V., MACFARLANE, PM, West Chester University, La Trobe Univer? sity, Melbourne, University of Adelaide, La Trobe University, Melbourne.

Video records were used for gait analysis and the metabolism of terrestrial locomotion was studied by measurement of oxygen consumption. Platypuses used walk? ing gaits (duty factor &lt; 0.50) with a sprawled stance. To limit interference from the exten? sive webbing on the forefeet, the platypuses walked on their knuckles. Metabolic rate in? creased linearly over a 2.4-fold range with increasing walking speed in manner similar with terrestrial mammals, but was low due to the relatively low standard metabolism of the monotreme.The cost of transport decreased with increasing speed to a minimum of 0.71 J/N m. When compared to the cost of trans? port for swimming, the metabolic cost for walk? ing was 1.89 times greater. This difference means that the platypus pays a price in ter? restrial locomotion by being more aquati- cally adapted than other semiaquatic or ter? restrial mammals. S11.1 FISH, F.E., West Chester University, PA. Mechanisms for enhanced maneuver- ability in organisms of varying flexibility. Maneuverability with respect to turning is critical to the performance of fast swim? ming animals. Turning is effected by dynamic forces. For many aquatic animals, these forces are dominated by steady non-inertial forces including lift and drag. Animals can use an asymmetrically applied drag to ro? tate and turn. Appendages modified as paddles can produce this effect which works well in conditions dictated by low velocity, continuous turning and precise control, but incurs a high energy cost. Lift-based maneu? vering systems have the advantage of pro? ducing a centripetal force to effect turning without incurring a large decelerating drag, but are limited in duration. Animals that use drag-based turning possess rigid bodies with a high degree of stability. Lift-based turning is associated with a flexible body or enlarged control surfaces. Flexible bodies possessed by fish and marine mammals have been shown to permit high levels of performance with respect to turning rate, centripetal ac? celeration, and turn radius. Rigid bodies do constrain turning performance, however, the inability to bend can be compensated for by the use of appendages and vectored thrust mechanisms. 64.3 FISHER, G.R.*, DIMOCK, R.V Jr., Wake Forest University. The role of the larval mantle cells during metamorphosis of Utterbackia imbecillis (Bivalvia: Unionidae). Larvae of Utterbackia imbecillis undergo a period of metamorphosis to the juvenile while parasitic on a host fish, but can also be induced to metamorphose in a modified cell culture medium. This metamorphosis involves some dramatic changes in the struc? ture of the larval mantle cells which are thought to be involved in digesting the de? generating larval adductor muscle and the host fish tissue. Transmission electron mi? croscopy and histochemistry for digestive enzymes were used to investigate the role of these cells in both fish-reared and in vitro- reared animals. TEM analysis revealed en- docytosis in the larval mantle cells but not in any other larval tissues. This was true even for in vitro-reareti animals which presum? ably ingest the larval adductor muscle since there is no fish tissue present. Fish-reared larvae showed no acid phosphatase activ? ity; however, the larval mantle cells of in vitro- reared larvae possessed lysosomes con? taining acid phosphatase and were also re? leasing acid phosphatase into the extracel? lular environment at cell boundaries. The dif? ferences in acid phosphatase activity be? tween the two rearing conditions may be due to the presence of glycogen in the fish-reared animals. Prior to the onset of metamorpho? sis, larvae possess large amount of glyco? gen stores in the tissues. In the in vitro-reared animals, these stores are depleted very early in metamorphosis, while in fish-reared ani? mals they remain until much later. Perhaps the acid phosphatase is not activated until the cells have used up their glycogen re? serves and require an external source of nutrition. It appears that the larval mantle cells play a role in the digestion of both the larval adductor muscle and host fish tissue during metamorphosis. 33.1 FOLK, DF*, BRADLEY, T.J., Univer? sity of California, Irvine.

McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="93">for increased desiccation resistance for over 200 generations. For each population of desiccation-resistant flies (D flies), a control population (C flies) was maintained under identical conditions, except that C flies had ad libitum access to water. Previous studies have demonstrated that increase in desic? cation resistance in D flies is associated with increases in bulk water content and reduc? tion in cuticular permeability to water. We tested two hypotheses concerning acquisi? tion and storage of bulk water in the desic- cation-tolerant populations: (1) that reduc? tion in post-eclosion diuresis in the D flies allows flies to accumulate more water early in the adult phase and (2) that the greatest portion of surplus water is stored in the hemolymph. Our results indicate that rate of urine elimination up to 4 h post-eclosion was not differentiated between the D flies and their controls. Differences in post-eclosion diuresis have, therefore, not evolved during selection for increased desiccation resis? tance. Analysis of water distribution in the body of the flies demonstratedthat the D flies have a statistically significant, 3.4-fold in? crease in hemolymph volume. On average 89% of the extra bulk water in the D flies is stored in the hemolymph. We are currently examining the significance of the extracel? lular location of this water on mechanisms of water use during desiccation in fruit flies. Funded by NSF Grant IBN9723404.

Larval development of many estuarine decapod crustaceans occurs in coastal/oce- anic areas. Thus, larvae are transported sea- ward from estuaries for development and then shoreward and up-estuaries to nurs- ery areas as post-larvae. This paper will fo? cus on selective tidal stream transport (STST) as the mechanism for horizontal movement in estuarine areas. The behavior underlying STST varies with species and is based on either a biological rhythm in activ? ity or behavioral responses to environmen? tal factors associated with tides. Transport of post-larvae terminates upon settlement and metamorphosis in nursery areas. Both posi? tive (e.g. odor from conspecifics and aquatic vegetation) and negative (e.g. ammonium, hypoxia, predator odor) cues for habitat se? lection and metamorphosis will be consid? ered. 37.3 FOUGEROLLE, M.F*, TURINGAN, R.G, Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne. The effects of prey type on the feeding biomechanics of Archosargus probatocephalus. Ubiquitous species in heterogeneous, coastal habitats typically encounter variable prey-resources. The biomechanical basis for the ability of A. probatocephalus to con? sume both soft and hard prey organisms within its environment was examined in an attempt to understand the mechanisms that underlie the abundance and distribution of this species. Fish from the same location within the Indian River Lagoon were reared under two diets: whole bean clams (Donax gouldii) [hard prey] and D. gouldii\N\Xh shells removed (soft prey). At the end of a 70-day rearing period, fish were measured for key biomechanical features of the prey-capture and processing mechanism. Analysis of Co? variance revealed that biting muscles and bones of fish fed hard prey were more mas? sive than fish fed soft prey. For a given body size, estimated biting strength of fish reared in hard-prey diet was greater than fish reared in soft-prey diet. Total body mass and me? chanical advantage of the feeding mecha? nism did not differ between diet treatments. We hypothesize that the ability of A. probatocephalus to consume different prey organisms is associated with its ability to al? ter the development of its feeding mecha? nism. Phenotypic plasticity appears to be one of the mechanisms that underlie a species ability to exploit locally available prey-re- source. 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Oral bioavailability was determined by comparing the blood concentration through time after oral (500 MICROg/kg body mass) and intravascular (IV; 200 MICROg/ kg body mass) administration at two ages (35 and 84 days) during postnatal develop? ment (during and after feather growth). The area under the blood concentration-time curves extrapolated to infinity (AUC) were calculated from the orally and IV-dosed chicks using the trapezoidal method. Bioavailability was estimated as the ratio of the dose-corrected oral AUC to the IV AUC. Bioavailability differed between ages and it was 77% at age 35 days and 92% for 84 day old chicks. We determined pharmacoki- netic parameters by fitting a two-compart- ment non-linear regression model to both concentration-time data sets, and this re? sulted in models that accurately predicted the initial rapid distribution phase and the linear excretion phase for both data sets (r2 &gt; 0.9 in all cases). The excretion rate con? stant differed between ages and was found to be 0.006 and 0.048 day1 for chicks aged 35 and 84 days, respectively. The mean elimination half-life of methylmercury in loon chicks was determined as 14 and 116 days for chicks aged 35 and 84 days, respectively. These results suggest that growing feathers are an important excretory route for ingested mercury.

Gryllotalpa major, the prairie mole cricket, is a rare species native to the Oklahoma grasslands. Little is known about this par? ticular species, and information is difficult to obtain because of its subterranean lifestyle. Of particular concern is our not being able to mark individuals in a population to track movements or gauge individual mating suc? cess. This study was designed to distinguish individual males based solely on their air- borne sexual advertisement calls. The males dwell within their own burrow systems in the ground and project their calls through a sur? face opening of an acoustic horn to attract females for mating. Cassette tape record? ings were collected from targeted burrows during the calling season and coverted to digitized sound files using SIGNAL software. These files were then subjected to correla- tional analyses to determine if we could dis? tinguish "same" from "different" with a high level of accuracy and repeatability. Athough other studies of insect sounds in this context have not been reported, recent success in identifying individual canaries, bats, wolves, etc. encouraged us to pursue this work. With the certainty of identification based on the call, new doors can be opened to the study of this and related species. Not only will male spacing and burrow establishment be open to new interpretation, but parameters of the calls of successful males can be examined to tease out the focus of female choice for the species. 26.1 FRANCIS, JR., A.W.*, TURINGAN, R.G., Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, Florida Institute of Technology, Melboume. Functional implications of asym? metrical feeding biomechanics in pleuronectiform fishes.

The development of morphological asymmetry is expected to 1018 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Biomechanical features associated with feeding in developing summer floun? der, Paralichthys dentatus, were measured for both ocular (left) and blind (right) sides. Using principles from mechanical engineer? ing, the measurement of lever arms respon? sible for lower jaw depression and eleva? tion allowed for the determination of me? chanical advantage for each side of the head. Mechanical advantage was then used to make functional predictions about feeding mode where the oral jaw lever system in fishes represents a compromise between speed of jaw movement and strength of bite. Analysis of variance or analysis of covari? ance revealed significant differences in le? ver arms and mechanical advantage be? tween sides of the head of late metamorphic and early juvenile summer flounder. In par? ticular, the ocular side is predicted to have a faster bite while the blind side is predicted to have a stronger bite. Work currently in progress will test predicted functional asym? metry using high speed recordings of feed? ing kinematics in developing flatfish. 37.5 FRANK, CL, Fordham University. The nutritional ecology of food hoarding by red squirrels. It has proposed that granivory and food hoarding coevolved repeatedly in mammals because seeds tend to retain their nutritional quality during storage, although this hypoth? esis has not been tested. The effects of pro? longed storage on the nutritional composi? tion of five conifer seed species hoarded by Mount Graham red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis, were examined in order to better understand the evolution of food storage. The results demonstrate that the nutritional quality of all conifer seed spe? cies examined decreases during storage by red squirrels, and three of the seed species no longer met the minimal nutritional require? ments of red squirrels after 3-8 months of storage. This study demonstrates that the evolution of food hoarding by red squirrels was probably actually constrained by the nutritional properties of their primary food. 46.6 FREEMAN, G., University of Texas, Austin. A developmental basis for the Cam? brian explosion: evidence from extant bra- chiopods. Paleontological evidence indicates that a large number of new animal phyla, in ad? dition to classes and orders within phyla, were first observed during the Cambrian. One possible basis for the genesis of new mor? phologies during this period may have been the ease with which developmental pro? grams responsible for regional specification during early development could be changed. Subsequently these developmental pro? grams are postulated to have become more tightly integrated, making changes in early development more difficult to effect and thereby reducing the variation that natural selection can operate on. Within the Linguliformea and Craniiformea, extant lingulids, discinids and craniids belong to orders that originated during the Cambrian. Within the Rynchonelliformea, extant rhynchonellids belong to the pentameride lineage that also originated during the Cam? brian. The other order, Terebratulida, with ex? tant families, originated via a series of inter? mediate forms, from a pentameride ances? tor at the base of the Devonian. By compar? ing cleavage patterns, fate maps, patterns of morphogenetic movements during gas? trulation, the timing of regional specification during early development, and the mechansisms responsible for regional specification in extant species one can as? sess whether there is more variation in the ways of going about early development in descendants of orders that originated dur? ing the Cambrian versus descendants of the Terebratulida which originated later. There are major differences in embryogenesis in groups that originated during the Cambrian. There are essentially no differences in the early embryologies of the rhynchonellid Hemithyris, and two representatives of the Terebratulida, although these forms are morphologically disparate. 800-955-1236 ?

Locomotor tracking of the spine-tailed devil ray, mobula japanica. Three-dimensional movements and for? aging ecology of a small manta ray species, the spine-tailed devil ray, Mobula japanica, were monitored using acoustic tracking (n = 2) and archival tagging techniques (n = 4) in the southern Sea of Cortez.The rays ranged in size from 65 -112 cm disc length (mean = 87.6 cm, n = 6) with track duration ranging from 21 to 28 hours. Simultaneous biophysi? cal oceanographic profiling allowed exami? nation of temperature profiles and prey dis? tribution in relation to ray movements. The primary prey of these rays is krill, Nyctiphanes simplex, which remains at depth (-150 m) in dense clouds during the day, then moves to the surface and disperses at night. The rays spent most of their time above the thermocline and appeared to for? age at night when the krill swarms approach the surface. When krill were present the animals displayed a step-wise ascent pat? tern which may indicate foraging through clouds of krill. Maximum dive depth during one track reached 445 m. Consistent throughout the tracks was a dive and ascent pattern suggestive of burst and glide swim? ming. Tracking speed was typically 1 knot with bursts up to 4.5 knots. The rays traveled up to 30 miles in 24 hours and did not al? ways remain in areas where krill density was high. Information on movements and habi? tat use is critical for understanding the im? pact of fisheries on manta ray populations. This impact is potentially high because of the mantasi low fecundity rates (-1 pup per year). In addition to improving our under? standing of their natural history, we hope this research will provide valuable information when management and conservation strat? egies are considered.

Evolution of insect eye develop? ment: comparative and functional evidence for a conserved role of Wingless in nega? tively controlling the spatial extent of retina differentiation. Molecular genetic studies in model or? ganisms like mouse and Drosophila have identified a number of genes, which appear to be expressed and required in similar ways during eye development. Fundamental as? pects of metazoan eye development are therefore likely to be evolutionarily con? served. Nonetheless, Drosophila exhibits a highly derived mode of insect eye develop? ment from imaginal discs, which may, to some degree, compromise its suitability for across phyla comparisons. It is also an im? portant question, which developmental regu? latory changes were involved in the transi? tion from embryonic eye development in primitive insects to the advanced mode of postembryonic eye development in Droso? phila. We are therefore studying eye devel? opment in the more primitive flour beetle Tribolium castaneum and the grasshopper Schistocerca americana. We have previ? ously shown that the expression of the sig? naling factor Wingless in front of the differ- entiating retina is highly conserved indicat? ing a conserved function in negatively regu? lating retina differentiation in insects. Con? sistent with this, we find that exposure of in vitro cultured grasshopper retinas to lithium, which constitutively activates Wingless sig? naling via inhibition of Glycogen synthase kinase-3, specifically blocks progression of retina differentiation. A detailed analysis of wingless expression during Tribolium em? bryogenesis revealed that Wingless is ex? pressed in a manner consistent with a func? tion in suppressing embryonic eye devel? opment thereby allowing only a small num? ber of larval photoreceptors to differentiate and facilitating the delay of adult retina dif? ferentiation into postembryogenesis. 39.1 FRYE, M.A. *, DANIEL, T.L, University of Washington, Seattle, University of Wash? ington, Seattle. Mechanical encoding prop? erties of the wing hinge stretch receptor in the hawkmoth. Insect flight emerges from complex inter? actions among patterned motor output, mus? culoskeletal mechanics, aerodynamic and inertial forces, and neural feedback. In the hawkmoth Manduca sexta, feedback from a wing hinge stretch receptor (SR) is crucial 1020 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="97">for the visuo-motor control of lift. Using a com? bination of extracellular recording, optical tracking, and high-speed video, we show that the SR undergoes sinusoidal length changes during tethered flight and fires a burst of spikes near the dorsal stroke rever? sal. We describe the mechanical encoding properties of the stretch receptor by com? paring experimental data to the output of a computational model in an effort to better understand how this specialized sensory organ encodes forces and strains acting on the wing hinge. Using a mechanical actua- tor, we measured tissue tension, deforma? tion, and SR spiking activity in response to controlled motions of the wing hinge. Step changes in tissue extension evoke an initial rapid increase followed by decay in both ten? sion and SR firing rate. These time depen? dent responses were fit to models of the tis? sue and the SR that are comprised of vis? cous and elastic elements. We compared simulation output to experimental results us? ing sinusoidal motion stimuli matching the in vivo deformations of thewing hinge. For such motions, the SR encodes timing, am? plitude, and frequency of experimental wing hinge deformation. Model results closely match tissue tension seen in vitro, however the model does not capture the firing pattern of the stretch receptor. Thus, stretch recep? tor responses are not determined by simple linear models, and non-linear characteris? tics or active encoding dynamics are needed to explain the behavior of this mechanore? ceptor.

Hagfishes are unique in their ability to produce vast quantities of fiber-reinforced slime when they are provoked. In order to understand the material properties of hag? fish slime, we investigated the properties of isolated slime threads from the Pacific hag? fish (Eptatretus stouti). The threads are manu- factured within specialized cells called Gland Thread Cells (GTCs), which are found within the numerous slime glands. Each GTC pro? duces a single, continuous, intricately coiled protein thread that unravels upon contact with seawater. We found GTCs to exhibit a bi-directional taper, being on average 3.0 1 0.4 mm in diameter in the middle, and 1.01 0.2, and 1.510.2 mm in diameter at the two (distinct) ends. Slime threads were on aver? age 1210.44 cm long in the unstrained state, but can be as long as 34 1 1.2 cm when strained to the breaking point. Tensile tests of the threads in seawater revealed them to be quite extensible and strong, and there? fore tough. Average extensibility (DELTA/Lo) in water was 1.810.11, strength was 1701 24 MPa, and toughness was 100 1 19 MJ/ m3. Threads tested in air were stronger, stiffer, tougher, and less extensible than those tested in seawater. Average extensibility in air was 1.0 1 0.10, strength was 520 MPa, and toughness was 270117 MJ/m3. Tensile tests performed in chaeotropic agents such as guanidine HCI suggest that the IF pro? teins that make up the threads are held to? gether by non-covalent intermolecular forces. Birefringence data and evidence from Congo Red staining of strained and unstrained threads suggest that the low modulus plateau region of the stress-strain curves corresponds to a transformation of alpha-helical and/or globular domains of the constituent IFs to a more highly-ordered beta-sheet crystalline state.

Species that differ in leg number and posture run stably like sagittal and horizontal plane spring-mass systems. Preflexive mechanisms at the level of legs permit passive, dynamic feedback that can reject rapid perturbations before sensor-based reflexes and thereby simplify control. A greater number of widely spaced, compliant legs potentially in contact with the substrate provide for robust, dynamic self- stabilization. Legs of sprawled posture run? ners produce lateral and opposing ground reaction forces, since these vectors tend to minimize joint moments by aligning along the leg axially. Front legs tend to decelerate the body, while rear legs only accelerate the 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ? Fax: (703) 790-2672 ? www.SICB.org 1021</page><page sequence="98">center of mass. All legs tend to push away from the body. Differential leg function in sprawled posture runners not only permits greater stability, but also greater maneuver- ability. Maneuvers can require minor neuro- mechanical alterations to straight-ahead running. A small change in force production can generate turning and climbing without large changes in leg kinematics. A greater number of widely spaced, compliant legs potentially in contact with the substrate pro? vide for greater maneuverability because of an increased opportunity to shift the center of pressure. Legged animals appear to man? age energy in a way that works with their natural dynamics.

Discoveries and principles in biology can provide inspiration for design in robotics, animatronics, animation and architecture. Unique materials and structures, remarkable functional relationships and the spectacu- larly effective performance found in natural technologies provide a wealth of ideas. Yet, blind, direct copying of biology is rare and often fails. Nature provides useful hints at what is possible. In most cases, it is more valuable to use concepts and analogies when advantageous. Natureis designs are constrained by development, history, func? tion and Newtonfs Laws. Human creations often extend beyond biological capabilities and can be made to be more effective. The flow of ideas is in no way unidirectional. In fact, historically, there has been more trans? fer from engineering, physics and math- ematics to biology than the reverse (Vogel, 1998). The conception and construction of artificial technologies has been extremely important in providing novel hypotheses and instrumentation to biology. Multidisciplinary experiences can benefit biological research directly and indirectly through the fostering of lateral thinking. The mutually beneficial reciprocal relationships between biology and engineering, computer science and enter- tainment are increasing exponentially. We are the verge of a revolution in the Age of Integration.

Molecular mechanisms underlying thyroid hormone induced gene expression cascades during amphibian metamorphosis. Amphibian metamorphosis is an excel? lent system to understand nuclear receptor function during development. Thyroid hor? mone (TH) induces a wide range of mor? phological changes by regulating gene ex? pression via a pair of nuclear receptors, TH receptor ALPHA (TRALPHA) and TH recep? tor BETA (TRBETA). Our laboratory is inter- ested in how this dramatic tissue specific transcriptional control by TH occurs. Previ? ous expression studies in the frog Xenopus laevis implicated TRALPHA in adult tissue formation and TRBETA in larval tissue re? sorption. We employed the TRBETA selec? tive agonist GC-1 as a pharmacological probe of TR function. In transfection assays, GC-1 activated Xenopus TRBETA 20-fold better than Xenopus TRALPHA, compared to the natural ligand T3. In GC-1 treated tad? poles, tail and gill resorption was efficiently induced with little effect on limb growth. In addition, GC-1 preferentially activated a subset of TH-response genes in the tail, in? cluding several protease genes. We are cur? rently screening additional syntheticTH ana? logs, as well as exploring other means to specifically manipulate TR isotype activity in living cells. Finally, we are characterizing the regulatory control regions of several TH re? sponse genes in vivo using transgenesis.

When isolated gills of Mercenaria mercenaria are treated with 5-hydrox? ytryptamine (5HT), the branchial muscula? ture contracts in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, a second application of 5HT at the same concentration produces a larger contraction; this effect is mediated by nitric oxide (NO) synthesized in the muscles. Since NO and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) both modulate muscle contraction in mammalian vascular smooth muscle and because Mercenaria is exposed to H2S in the envi? ronment, we investigated the effects of H2S on gill muscle contraction. When gills were pretreated with 106 M H2S and then exposed to increasing concentrations of 5HT, the dose response curve was shifted to the left and the maximal contraction increased in com? parison with untreated controls. With 10'6 M H2S, the concentration of 5HT giving a half maximal contraction (EC50) was 1.1 x 105 M and the maximal contraction was 32% of the resting length at 104 M 5HT. In untreated gills, in contrast, the EC^ was 2.8x105 M and the maximal contraction was only 12%. Finally, when gills were pretreated with in? creasing concentrations of H2S and then exposed to 2x105 M 5HT, the contractions were potentiated in a dose dependent man? ner. The threshold for potentiation was 1010 M H2S, and the effect became maximal be? tween tO-8 and 105 M.

Breath holding is common in reptiles. Intermittent breathing also occurs in very large mammals; whale, elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, and giraffe. Both groups have low rates of metabolism. Ectothermy allows the low rates of reptiles. Endotherms have higher metabolic rates that are inversely re? lated to body size. Hence the mass specific metabolic rate of a 4000 kg elephant is about the same as a 1 kg monitor lizard. Low meta? bolic rates are coupled to low breathing fre? quencies, 6 breaths per minute (bpm) for the elephant and 3 bpm for the lizard. At low bpm, intermittent breathing reduces the cost of ventilation. Continuous slow breathing has lower airflow velocities that decrease the fric- tional resistance to both laminar and turbu- lent flow. But brief rapid discontinuous breaths use less energy overall because very slow respiratory muscle contraction is extremely inefficient. A female African el? ephant weighing about 4000 kg was videorecorded during rest. Thoracic move? ments were analyzed frame by frame with a potential accuracy of 1/30th see. Breath fre? quency, bpm; and the durations of: inspira? tion Ti, expiration Te, and the pauses be? tween breaths Tp; were measured. Average values were; bpm 5.8, Ti 3.1 see, Te 1.9 see, Tp 5.1 see. Breath holding was in the in- spiratory position. Initial observations of rhi? noceros and giraffe were qualitatively the same, but with higher bpm and shorter du? rations that correlate with smaller body masses. This ventilatory pattern is reminis- cent of reptilian inspiratory breath holding and active expiration of shorter duration than passive inspiration. Inspiratory pauses have the advantage of a larger air volume to draw upon during apnea. Whether the breathing pauses of very large mammals are also at respiratory system relaxation volume, thus requiring no muscular effort, remains to be tested. 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Rela? tionship between the physiological stress response, serum IGFBPs, and growth in the jack mackerel. Metabolic and somatic growth param? eters were assessed in Trachurus symmetricus subjected to confinement and handling stressors. Mackerel were caught offshore nearCatalina Island and placed into 50-L circular aquaria for 5 d without further disturbance ("confinement" group) followed by blood serum coliection, or they were sub? jected to an additional 30 or 60 min of han? dling stress prior to blood sampling ("han? dling" groups). Controls were caught and immediately sampled (within 2 min). Con? finement alone increased serum concentra? tions of glucose (&gt;2-fold, p&lt;0.01) and re? sulted in 6-fold elevations in cortisol (p&lt;0.001), as compared with correspond? ing levels in control fish. With the additional handling, cortisol concentrations were el? evated yet further as compared with that in the confinement group (p&lt;0.05 at 60 min), while glucose levels did not show this trend. Serum profiles of the insulin-like growth fac- tor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) exhibited changes reflective of a growth-inhibited state in the stressed mackerel, with the greatest magnitude of such changes evident in the individuals with the highest cortisol levels. Results thus far suggest that stress-associ- ated cortisol may play an inhibitory role in growth via changes in the IGF system.

The phylotypic stage is the developmen? tal stage at which vertebrates most resemble each other. In an earlier study we found sup? port for Raff's hypothesis that the remark? able conservation of the phylotypic stage in vertebrates is due to the high number of on? going interactions. Interestingly, the lack of modularity of inductive interactions at that stagemay not only have conserved this em- bryonal stage more than other developmen- tai stages, but may also have had conse? quences for the conservedness of adult char? acters determined in this stage. Possible ex? amples are the number of digits in amniotes and the number of cervical vertebrae in mammals. Evidence will be discussed. I end by presenting an argument why the absence of modularity in the inductive interactions may also be the root cause of the conserva? tion of the much discussed temporal and spatial colinearity of the Hox genes in the phylotypic stage of vertebrates.

Comparative analyses of iguanian lizard morphology have shown that certain body proportions are consistently associated with particular microhabitats. This result suggests that a single genus with ecologically diverse species will exhibit morphological variation reflecting their ecological niches. Morpho? logical measurements were taken from spe? cies of Sceloporus of varied microhabitat specialization, ranging from ground dwell- ers to saxicolous species. Saxicolous spe? cies, which regularly encounter inciine in their habitat are expected to exhibit a lower length ratio between the most distal and proximal joints than ground-dwelling spe? cies. Saxicolous species are also expected to have proportionally shorter hind limbs when compared to those of ground dwell- ers. Likewise, locomotor kinematics and performance variables are expected to cor? relate with ecological niche and morphol? ogy. Prior studies have found that species of different body proportions exhibit changes in locomotor kinematics on flat versus in? clined substrates. In this study, species of Sceloporus of varied ecomorphologies were recorded running on horizontal and inclined surfaces to determine how the type of ter- rain an animal inhabits affects locomotion.

A comparison of phylo? genetic diversification in crab spiders (Araneae: Thomisidae) across three Polynesian archipelagos. Crab spiders of the genus Misumenops (Araneae: Thomisidae) have repeatedly colo? nized and diversified on a number of Pacific island archipelagos. Depsite the similarity in the geologic formation of the Hawaiian, Society and Marquesan archipelagos, their endemic crab spider faunas possess re? markably different levels of diversity. Twenty- one crab spider species have been de? scribed from the Hawaiian Islands. These species are exceptionally diverse in colora? tion, reflecting their specialization of mim- icry onto several different microhabitat types. In contrast, only one species is known from both the Marquesan and Society Islands. In an effort to understand if the different pat? terns exhibited in these three archipelagos is a result of different levels of colonizations and/or in s/furadiation, we conducted a phy? logenetic investigation of Polynesian crab spiders using both molecular and morpho? logical characters. The results of a combined analysis of morphological and mitochondrial DNA sequence data indicate that although a greater number of colonization to the Ha? waiian archipelago may partially account for its species richness, the greater levels of morphological diversity exhitibed by the Hawaiian crab spiders are likely to have re? sulted from rapid in s/fr/diversification.

The phylogenetic relationship between Rotifera and Acanthocephala has been a matter of debate for several years. Although these phyla are clearly related, the exact relationship between them had proven diffi? cult to determine with only morphological data. Several phylogenetic analyses based on sequence data have produced trees with Acanthocephala included within Rotifera instead of as a sister phylum. However, the relationship of Acanthocephala to the three classes of Rotifera (Bdelloidea, Seisonidea, Monogononta) has been more difficult to resolve. Some 18S and 16S rDNA studies have shown Acanthocephala to be a sister taxon to Bdelloidea, whereas heat shock protein 82 has placed Acanthocephala as a sister group to a elade composed of both Bdelloidea and Monogononta. A more re? cent 18S rDNA study showed Acantho? cephala as the sister group of Rotifera. Sev? eral new 18S sequences for acanthoceph- alans and monogonont rotifers are now available. We are sequencing the 18S genes from three additional rotifer species: The bdelloids Habrotrocha constrictaand Adineta vaga, and the monogonont floseularid Sinantherina socialis.

One project involves reconstructing foot kinematics in 210 million year old dinosaurs based on fos? sil trackways from Greenland. Many of the tracks were made by theropods sinking to considerable depth, thereby causing the substrate to intercept and preserve foot movements in 3-D. Tracks are simulated using a NURBS model foot skeleton, which emits particles as it passes through a vol? ume of "sediment" of variable depth. Re? constructed stance phase movements are then modified to produce tracks matching the fossil data. A second project focuses on bird flight. Accurate measurement of wing joint angles has remained elusive due to the 3-D complexity of the wingbeat cycle. By rotoscoping a NURBS model pigeon over frames of high-speed X-ray film, skeletal motion can be simultaneously animated and quantified. This methodology allows a wing's real (rather than "realistic") motion to be ana? lyzed at an unprecedented level of resolu? tion, yielding both animations and data.

Identification of car? bonic anhydrase isoforms in the gills of the shore crab, and changes in their expression during acclimation to low salinity. At low salinity, the epithelium in the pos? terior gills of the shore crab, Carcinus maenas, is believed to take up chloride and sodium from the environment in exchange for intracellular bicarbonate and protons, which are generated within the cell by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA). During acclimation to low salinity, CA activity in the posterior gills increases during the first 96 hours of exposure, whereas CA activity in the anterior gills does not change signifi? cantly. Most of the increased CA activity is found in the cytoplasm, with a smaller in? crease associated with the microsomal frac? tion. Using RT-PCR we have identified and partially sequenced two isoforms of carbonic anhydrase from the posterior gills of the shore crab. These isoforms share several highly conserved, CA-specific, amino acid residues with mammalian isoforms, but have only a 30% amino acid homology with each other. Isoform-specific PCR primers were designed, and the levels of mRNA for each isoform was determined by quantitative PCR. Although mRNA for both isoforms was de? tected, one of the forms is expressed in much greater amounts than the other. During ac? climation to low salinity, levels of mRNA for both isoforms increased approximately 2.5- fold, reaching maximal levels after 48-72 hours. Future studies will be done to deter? mine the specific sub-cellular location of each isoform, and their exact role in ionic homeo? stasis. Supported by NSF (IBN-9807539) and Mt.

Evaluation of hatchling Kemp's ridley sex ratios using nest incubation temperatures at Rancho Nuevo, Mexico. The Kemp's ridley sea turtle, Lepidochelys kempi, is the most endangered sea turtle in the world. It possesses tempera? ture-dependent sex determination (TSD) in which the incubation temperature of the egg determines the sex of the hatchling. Past stud? ies have suggested that TSD has the poten? tial of producing highly biased sex ratios, 1026 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="103">which may not be advantageous to the re? covery of endangered sea turtle populations. Therefore, it is of great importance to moni- tor hatchling sex ratio production in nesting beach conservation programs. The primary nesting grounds of the Kemp's ridley is lo? cated on a stretch of beach near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico, where an international con? servation effort (coordinated by Instituto Nacional de la Pesca) monitors all nesting and relocates all nests to protected areas (i.e. egg corrals). During the current study, nest temperatures were monitored in rela? tively large numbers of nests over three nest? ing seasons (1998-2000). This included monitoring nests in three different egg cor? rals throughout each of the nesting seasons. Temperature data from the initial two years of this study suggest that a majority of the nests produced mostly or all females, indi? cating an overall female bias for the 1998 and 1999 nesting seasons. We are currently analyzing the data from the 2000 nesting season. The biased sex ratios predicted dur? ing the current study exemplify the need to monitor hatchling sex ratios produced in sea turtle conservation programs. Such informa? tion is a prerequisite to the development of effective management strategy for endan? gered populations. S2.6 GHEDOTTI, M., Regis University Un- paired fins: derived genitalia in fishes. A review of the diversity of genitalia de? rived from unpaired fins in actinopterygiian fishes is presented. The modifications of the anal fin and urogenital region among actinopterygiians are morphologiacally quite varied. The most commonly known and best understood anal-fin derived genitalia are those of the cyprinodontiform fishes. How? ever, median-fin derived genitalia are found in a wide range of distantly related actinopterygiian taxa. This variation in mor? phology provides an existing reservoir of information concerning the developmental mechanisms associated with the formation of a genital region along the body axis. Like natural teratology or experimental perturba- tion of development, natural variation among taxa provides valuable information concern? ing basic developmental patterns and pos? sible developmental outcomes.

Functional morphology and biochemistry: is there a correlation be? tween metabolic enzyme activity and swim? ming performance? Many animals, including marine fishes, are difficult to study in their natural habitat. Consequently, little is known about their rou? tine behavior and locomotor performance. Comparative physiologists and ecologists have searched for a specific morphological, physiological or biochemical parameter that could be easily measured in a captive, fro- zen, or preserved animal, and that would accurately predict the routine behavior of that species in the wild. Many investigators have measured the levels of activity of specific enzymes involved in energy metabolism in the body musculature of marine fishes, gen? erally assuming that high specific activities of enzymes involved in aerobic metabolism are indicators of high levels of aerobic per? formance and of sustained swimming abil? ity and that high activities of anaerobic meta? bolic enzymes indicate high levels of burst swimming performance. In this paper, we review the comparative data that support this hypothesis. Perhaps more importantly, we outline recent studies we have conducted that specifically test the hypothesis that lev? els of enzyme activity in the myotomal mus? culature of fishes correlate with locomotor performance. In these studies, we combined the fields of biochemistry and functional mor? phology by measuring enzyme activities and swimming performance in the same indi? viduals and comparing this relationship across several different species. Finally, we suggest areas of further investigation that may provide biochemical indices that are accurate predictors of animal performance. 45.3 GILBERT, S.F*, LOREDO, G.A., BRUKMAN, A., TUAN, R., Swarthmore Col? lege, Thomas Jefferson University, Swarthmore College, Thomas Jefferson Uni? versity.

The carapace contains fifty unique bones, while the plas? tron contains nine bones. In the carapace, the most dorsal bones are formed by the neural portion of the spine, while the costal bones are formed from the dermis between the ribs. The marginal bones form along the edges of the shell mesoderm. The ribs be? come trapped in the carapacial ridge (CR), a structure resembling the limb bud. We show that the mesoderm of the CR ex- presses fgf10. FGF10 is found in the limb bud where it acts as an agent of cell prolif? eration and chemotaxis. In the carapace, the neural bones and the nuchal bone are the first new bones to be seen. Meanwhile, the anterior ribs show an expanded region of bone around them, and the ribs appear to be inducing new bone from the dermis around them.By 120 days, the ossifying der? mal regions between the ribs have coa- lesced. The future plastron can be identified by nine ossification centers in the ventral der? mis. No alcian blue staining is seen presag- ing these sites. The three ossification cen? ters corresponding to the three anterior plas? tron bones will fuse first, and the six mar? ginal ossification centers ofthe plastron grow toward each other and fuse. Condensed mesenchyme presages the advance of these spicules. The bony spicules cross the midline, but avoid fusing until later in devel? opment. We are presently attempting to iden? tify the paracrine and transcription factors regulating the development of these evolu? tionary novel structures.

Host-Parasite coevolution has long been an area of interest of evolutionary biologists. However, most mathematical models on the evolution of parasite virulence view the host as a static, non-evolving entity. By focusing on the dynamics of the parasite population within a host and by coupling these dynam? ics with a simple model of the host's immune response, we are able to simultaneously explore the evolutionary dynamics of both the host and the parasite. Our findings indi? cate that there is a single evolutionary stable equilibrium towards which the system evolves. Furthermore, the impact of the dis? ease on host survivorship and parasite fit? ness at the equilibrim is a function of its lo? cation which in turn is a function of the cost of the host's immune response and the amount of damage caused by each unit of parasite growth.

An eight-year study at Bailey's Cay has revealed a dynamic shell cycling system between hermit crabs on the coral reef, in backreef seagrass, and on land. Predators such as octopuses, crabs and fish consume both hermit crabs and gastropods on the reef. Birds, crabs, and flies eat terrestrial hermit crabs and gastropods. Typical shell cycling is from the reef to land with little movement in the opposite direction. Hurricane Mitch hovered near the Cay, scouring the reef with sand, depositing sand in seagrass areas, and submerging the island for 3 days. Com? parisons of shell use patterns, population sizes and distributions of hermit crabs and their predators before and after Mitch show consistency in shell types used and remark? able persistence of shells within the system. Predators are of nearly uniform year class as are several species of hermit crabs. Her? mit crab visits to artificial and natural preda? tion sites increased in frequency after Mitch though "quality" of shells occupied appeared higher than those used by crabs in previous years. 61.2 GILLIS, G.B.*, BIEWENER, A.A., Harvard University, Harvard University. Plas? ticity in limb muscle function during locomo? tion. Studies of musculoskeletal function in vivo during vertebrate locomotion have typi? cally focused on muscles performing a spe? cific role over a limited range of activities. As a result we currently have little appreciation for the breadth of function some muscles might exhibit over a broader range of activi? ties. Using sonomicrometry and electromyo- 1028 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="105">graphy, we investigated patterns of activa? tion and strain in the vastus lateralis and bi- ceps femoris of rats during walking, trotting and galloping across different grades, and during swimming. During locomotion over ground, EMG bursts generally occupy the first 60-70% of the stance phase, and in? crease in intensity with increased speed or grade. Decreased grades lead to decreases in EMG intensity; particularly in the biceps, which exhibits little or no activity during down- hill locomotion at any speed. During swim? ming, both muscles exhibit substantially shorter (about 30% of the propulsive phase), but more intense, EMG bursts. Total fascicle strain is higher during walking, trotting and swimming (0.21-0.26) than during gallop? ing (0.15-0.17). Moreover, patterns of length change vary from nearly sinusoidal during swimming, to more complex waveforms on land. Finally, alterations in strain and stimu? lation in the vastus appear to change its mechanical role during locomotion. During walking, trotting and galloping (non-lead limb), the vastus is active mostly while iso? metric or during lengthening, however, dur? ing swimming or galloping (lead limb), it is active largely during shortening. Thus, the same muscle can shift from absorbing en? ergy to generating energy, depending on gait or environment. These results indicate that some muscles in the rat hindlimb can ex? hibit substantial plasticity with respect to their gross function during locomotion. 61.1 GIRARD, I.*, MCALEER, M. W., RHODES, J. S., GARLAND, T, Jr., University of Wisconsin-Madison. Increased intermit- tency of locomotion in house mice selec? tively bred for high voluntary wheel running. After 21 generations of artificial selection for increased wheel running, female house mice (Mus domesticus) from replicate se? lection lines demonstrated greatly increased voluntary locomotion on running wheels (cir- cumference 1.12 m; Behav. Genet., 1998, 28:227-237), compared with individuals from random-bred control lines (L.S. Mean 1 SE of wheel running on day 6 of a 6-day test: selection = 10,846 1 2,023 rev/d; control = 2,4441551 rev/d). In nature, many animals use intermittent locomotion, which, in labo- ratory studies, has been shown to increase distance endurance as compared with con? tinuous exercise. We hypothesized that in? creased intermittency may have evolved in the lines of mice selected for high wheel run? ning. To describe detailed patterns of run? ning, we videotaped wheel running on day 6 of a 6-day test. For each mouse (n = 41), we analyzed 5 minutes of videotape in which the mean running speed (revs per 1-minute interval) was 75-100% of the maximum rpm observed over the entire day 6. Proportion of time spent running did not differ between animals from selected and control lines. Se- lection-line females ran significantly more frequently (7.8 ?1.2 bouts/min), faster (41 ? 3.0 rpm while actually running), and in shorter bouts (9.9 ? 2.5 sec/bout), as com? pared with controls (3.4 ? 1.2 bouts/min; 20 ?1.1 rpm; 16.8 ? 2.5 sec/bout). Running bouts were interrupted by the mouse coasting or exiting the wheel: inter-bout pauses were shorter in selection-line (2.7 ? 0.6 see) than in control-line (7.4 ? 0.6 see) females. Be? cause selection-line females may be run? ning at speeds near their aerobic threshold, intermittency in locomotion may be a key feature allowing the increased wheel-run- ning performance of these mice.

A physi? ological mediator of the response to intraspe? cific competition in Rana pipiens tadpoles. Competition is known to decrease growth and development rate in larval anurans, but the physiological mediators of this response have not been identified. We measured whole-body corticosterone content in Rana pipiens tadpoles raised at two different den? sities and three food levels. Both limited food and high density were associated with sig? nificantly elevated corticosterone content. Within the medium and low food treatments, high density decreased tadpole growth and slowed development, while within the high food group, high density was associated with greater growth and accelerated development (possibly an Allee effect). Lower food levels consistently slowed growth and develop- 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ? Fax: (703) 790-2672 ? www.SICB.org 1029</page><page sequence="106">ment. Blocking corticosterone synthesis with metyrapone (MTP) reversed the effect of density on growth but not development and did not change the effect of limited resources on growth or development. Thus, corticos? terone appears to mediate the effect of in? creased density on tadpole growth. These results are consistent with developmental studies that have shown high doses of ex? ogenous corticosterone to affect growth but not development in pre-metamorphic tad? poles. Identification of such proximate me- diators of tadpolesf responses to their envi? ronment adds to our understanding of am? phibian physiological ecology and could improve and simplify predictions about spe? cies interactions and their community-level outcomes.

Material properties shape dynamical responses of hydrozoan jellyfish. Radially symmetrical and composed of acellular mesoglea, two cell layers, and a primitive nervous system, jellyfish are an ei- egantly simple launching point to investigate how material properties of the musculoskel? etal system shape the dynamics of locomo? tion. Mesoglea, composed of mucopolysac- charides, collagen, and water, has a char? acteristic nonlinear response to an applied strain. This study asks how such nonlinearities determine the dynamical re? sponse of a jellyfish's simple geometry sub? ject to periodic forcing. We compare the strain-dependent stiffness of mesoglea be? tween three species of jellyfish, Mitrocoma cellularia, Polyorchis penicillatus, and Aequorea victoria, each with a distinctive overall shape. Because of the nonlinear and time-dependent behavior of mesoglea, we measure the complex modulus by record? ing its stress in response to sinusoidal strains at a variety of frequencies and mean lengths. Using a simple power law to fit the resultant relationships between complex modulus and mean length, we describe the strength of nonlinearity in mesoglea by the size of the exponent. Aequorea victoria, a jellyfish with unevenly distributed mesoglea and un? usual swimming kinematics, has the high? est mesoglea exponent, making it the most strongly nonlinear, while Mitrocoma cellularia, a jellyfish with a relatively simple geometry and typical swimming kinematics, has the Iowest . The exponent describing the mesoglea of Polyorchis penicillatus falls in between, although it more closely re? sembles Aequorea. Armed with these esti? mates, we use a simple dynamical model to show that very subtle changes in the strength of the nonlinearity are manifest as signifi? cant changes in the spectral responses of the musculoskeletal system to periodic forc? ing.

Amphibian meta? morphosis is inhibited by environmentally relevant concentrations of ammonium per- chlorate. Ammonium perchlorate (AP, NH4CI04) has been used as an oxidizer component in solid rocket propellants for more than 50 yrs. AP detection in surface and ground waters near aerospace materials storage areas, as well as the fact that perchlorate inhibits thy- roidal iodide uptake, suggests that environ? mental AP may disrupt thyroid activity in hu? mans and wildlife. Here we describe AP ef? fects on development and metamorphosis in Xenopus laevis. Eggs and larvae were exposed to a range of AP concentrations and control medium for 70 days. AP inhib? ited thyroid-hormone-dependent aspects of growth and metamorphosis in a reversible manner. Preliminary findings indicate that environmentally relevant concentrations of AP inhibit tail resorption as determined by the EDSTAC Tier I test for thyroid hormone disruption. These effects were observed at concentrations at or below those reported in 1030 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

In dioecious, cultivated spinach, Spinacia oleracea, the presence or absence of re? productive organs is determined by organ primordia initiation rather than by degenera? tion of existing organ primordia as found in maize, sorrel, and campion. Male and fe? male flowers differentiate morphologically early in floral morphogenesis (stage 2) when sepal primordia are formed. Hence, sexual determination is established before stamen or carpel primordia are formed and appears to follow canalized developmental path? ways. Two lines of evidence demonstrate that sexual dimorphism in spinach is deter? mined by facultative regulation of sex spe? cific genes. First, we have determined by in situ hybridization that spinach B class ho? mologs, SpAP3 and SpPI, are expressed throughout the male floral meristem before stamen primordia are formed, then. subse- quently, become restricted to stamen primor? dia. Expression of either gene is not detect? able in any stage of female flower develop? ment. This implies that sex determination oc? curs at or upstream of B class gene expres? sion, and that downstream targets of the B class genes will be differentially expressed in males and females. This also implies that these expression patterns may control the development of sexual dimorphism in spin? ach. Second, in two cultivars, 30-40% of potentially female plants develop as males when GA3 is applied, indicating that sex de- termination can be regulated upstream of the organ identity genes. Furthermore, a third cultivar does not exhibit a male bias in re? sponse to GA3, indicating that genes up? stream of the normal organ identity genes determine sex and are polymorphic. These results suggest that sexual lability itself can potentially evolve in this species. P1.BBGORDON, S.D*, STEVEN-SON, R, University of Colorado, Boulder, University of Massachusetts, Boston. Long-term mass gains relative to meal size and sugar con? centration in two species of butterflies, Pieris rapae and Manataria maculata. We investigated how the concentration of sugar in artificial nectar affects meal size and changes in body mass of Pieris rapae, a widely dispersed common Pierid species captured in Boston, MA and Manataria maculata, a long-lived fruit eating tropical Satyrine species captured in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Butterflies were kept in labora? tory cages and had limited opportunity for activity. The initial mass (mg) and wing length (mm) were recorded for each individual. On a daily basis, five (Pieris) or six groups (Manataria) of 5-7 individuals were fed spe? cific sugar water concentrations ranging from 0 to 50% by weight until satiated. Body mass was recorded both before and after feeding. Groups offered pure water took in the small? est meal sizes averaging about 5% of their body mass. In contrast, the groups fed at approximately 10% took in the largest mass per meal, averaging 16% for Pieris and 55% for Manataria. At higher sugar concentra? tions, meal size declined in both species, however groups fed between 40% and 46% took in the largest amounts of sucrose per meal. Over the duration of the trials, groups fed between 38% and 40% sugar water gained the most weight, roughly 85% for the Pieris (20 days) and just under 13% for the Manataria (7 days). Both the species that fed on water alone lost mass. The results address ecological implications (water bal? ance, metabolic rate, condition indices) and raise questions about physiological limita? tions (meal size, long term mass gain) for each species. 800-955-1236 ?

Fish-eating birds are exposed to high levels of organochlorines in some ecosys? tems. Our objective was to assess the ef? fects of organochlorines on immune func? tion of young wild herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and Caspian terns (Sterna caspia) from the Great Lakes and black guillemots (Cepphus grylle) from Labrador. Immunological status was assessed in 3-4 week old chicks using general indicators (white blood cell counts and immune organ masses) and specific tests of immune func? tion (the phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin test for T cell function and the anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) antibody test for humoral immune function). An intradermal injection of PHA into the wing web was used to stimu? late a T cell dependent reaction that was measured 24 h after injection. An intrave- nous injection of SRBC was used to stimu? late an antibody response that was mea? sured in plasma 6 days after immunization. In all three species, suppression of the PHA test was strongly associated with organochlo? rine exposure. This suppression of T cell function was consistent with thymic atrophy observed in guillemot chicks and herring gull chicks and embryos. In Caspian tern chicks, the antibody response was positively asso? ciated with PCBs and 1,1 -dichloro-2,2-bis(P- chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE).

The six, paired cephalic appendages of decapod crustaceans provide sensory in? formation to the highest centers of the brain. These bear sensory organs devoted to one primary and a number of secondary sen? sory modalities and allow these animals to actively probe and investigate their environ? ment. Of these the antennules are special? ized to provide chemical and rheotactic in? formation. . We performed a morphological survey of 30 representatives of the Palinuridae (spiny lobsters). Across these species we found a 27-fold variation (esti? mated from morphology) in volume sampled by the olfactory sensilla (the aesthetascs) on these appendages. This contrasts with negligible variation in Nephophidae (clawed lobsters) and Scyllaridae (slipper lobsters) of comparable body size. We also found that the length of the antennules the covered by the aesthetascs on 23 species of spiny lob? sters from the genus Panuluris does not scale in proportion to antennule length; the ratio decreased with increasing antennule length. Because the aesthetascs are located at the distal tips of the antennules, we suggest that the observed variation in olfactory sampling volume serves to increase the range of two- point discrimination rather than to increase the total receptor surface. We speculate that the variation may be accounted for by the flow regimes typical to each species niche. 28.4 GREAVES, W.S., University of Illinois at Chicago. Modeling the location of the mammalian tooth row. A previous study suggested that mam? malian tooth rows should be confined to the anterior seventy percent of total jaw length because that situation maximized the aver? age bite force along the jaw. In the study described here, an estimate of the distance between the right and left tooth rows was determined using a similar analysis. For a sample of tooth rows in different hypotheti? cal locations, relative bite force was plotted from the first incisor at one end of each tooth row to the third molar at the other end. Inte- grating the equations of these bite force plots gave the area under each curve. (The area under the curve is a measure of the sum of all the bite forces along any given tooth row.) This sum was then divided by the length of the jaw, from joint to incisor, giving the aver? age bite force along an entire jaw. In this model, the location of the hypothetical tooth 1032 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Jaw width is be? tween sixty and eighty percent of jaw length In many mammals. The model predicts that for animals with a W: L ratio within this range, the distance between the right and left tooth rows, measured at the molars, will be be? tween fifty and sixty-three percent of the dis? tance between the two jaw joints. 66.5 GREEN, A.K.*, WARD, D, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Ben Gurion Univer? sity of the Negev, Israel. Dispersal of hemiparasitic mistletoe (Plicosepalus acaciae) by the yellow-vented bulbul (Pycnonoyus xanthopygos) among Acacia trees in Israel. Infection by the mistletoe (Plicosepalus acaciae) may exacerbate the already low and infrequent recruitment of Acacia raddiana, A. tortilis, and A. gerrardii negevensis (&lt;1%) trees in ephemeral river valleys (wadis) of the Arava valley, Israel. Yellow-vented Bulbuls (Pycnonotus xanthopygos) were shown to be the primary, if not sole, dispersal vectors of this mistletoe. Bulbuls removed the fruit's protective exo- carp, swallowed the pulp-covered seed whole, and defecated the viable, viscin-cov- ered seed (% germination of defecated seeds=50.0%; n=66 seeds). Foraging ob? servations during summer, fail, and winter indicated that mistletoe fruits were con? sumed when present, but were a substan? tial portion of the diet (&gt;70% of foraging at? tempts) only when fruits were abundant in the late fail. Bulbuls spent most of their time perched in Acacia trees (range: 55%-92%). We combined data on bulbul movements between Acacia host trees with data on tran? sit times of mistletoe seeds (range: 4-55 min; Mean?S.D. = 19?4 min; n=10 bulbuls) to cre? ate a probability distribution of seed deposi? tion as a function of distance from the parent mistletoe plant (seed shadow). The seed shadow indicated that a mistletoe seed is deposited on the same host tree as the par? ent plant only 4% of the time. The modal dis? persal distance is 40-50m (&gt;13% probabil? ity), and the maximum distance is 270-280m (&lt; 1 % probability). These data show that the bulbul provides quality, directed dispersal for mistletoe. The increasing population of bulbuls following the increase in agriculture and human settlements in this region could further spread P acaciae and enhance the threat to the long-term survival of Acacia populations in the Arava valley of Israel.

Real or perceived changes in the envi? ronment of a lizard can evoke adaptive be? havioral responses that are coordinated by the neural and endocrine mechanisms of the stress response. Acute responses, in? volving catecholamines released in varying proportion at different sites along their sym- pathetic pathways may interact with and be complemented by chronic responses involv? ing the hypothalamic-adrenocortical system. The central and systemic consequences of these actions include apparent changes in affect and motivation. These changes result in altered responses to environmental stimuli including the social stimuli that male and female conspecifics may provide. This re? view will collate and summarize the results of a program of research into the neural and endocrine causes and consequences of specific behavioral patterns seen in the small diurnal lizard, Anolis carolinensis. I will then attempt a synthesis that will hopefully illumi- nate the manner in which autonomic ref lexes come under the influence of environmental stimuli and attain significance as social sig? nals. 34.3 GREENLEE, K.J.*, HARRISON, J.F, EGBERT, K, Arizona State University, Tempe. How does the respiratory response to hy? poxia change throughout ontogeny in a grasshopper and a caterpillar? As insects age, body size can increase dramatically. For example, grasshoppers (Schistocerca americana) grow to 100 times their original mass, and larval tobacco horn- worms (Manduca sexta) increase an impres- sive 7,000-fold from hatchling mass. How do these increases in size affect the function of the insect respiratory system? To explore 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

We hypothesized that larger insects would tolerate hypoxia better than smaller insects due to an increased usage of convective gas exchange. As predicted, larger grasshoppers had much lower criti? cal P02 is (the P02 at which MC02 became significantly lower than that in normoxia) and had an increased ability to enhance abdomi? nal pumping in response to hypoxia. The MC02 of small grasshoppers decreased al? most logarithmically with P02, supporting the hypothesis that smaller grasshoppers rely more on diffusion for gas exchange. In con? trast, caterpillar body size had no effect on critical P02, suggesting that tracheal oxygen delivery capacity matches the increased tis? sue needs for oxygen across all sizes. We also hypothesized that caterpillars would have relatively high critical P02 is due to their lack of visible respiratory movements and because reported critical P02 is for fly and beetle larvae are greater than values for adults and pupae. However, critical P02 is for M. sexta were low and similar to those found for S. americana adults (near 5 kPa 02).

Development of a DNA probe for the identification of early- stage Mercenaria mercenaria (hard clam) larvae. Early-stage bivalve larvae are extremely difficult to identify unequivocally using mor? phological methods because they lack di? agnostic characteristics. As part of a study of larval transport of estuarine bivalves, an oligonucleotide probe was developed for identifying Mercenaria mercenaria larvae. The 18S rRNA gene from M. mercenaria was sequenced and compared with other bivalve species, including four species (from differ? ent genera) within the family Veneridae. A 25 base-pair region of the gene was identi? fied that was unique to the genus Mercenaria. Subsequent tests using dot-blot hybridization revealed that the probe bound only to the Venerid species M. mercenaria, M. campechiensis, and Venerupis philippinarum. The method of using DNA probes with dot-blot hybridization for the identification of larvae should prove useful for small-scale studies where accurate iden? tification of larvae is necessary.

The advent of comparative molecular databases has generated new hypotheses about animal phylogeny that are reshaping our understanding of animal evolution. For example, the bilaterian phyla are now often grouped into three major clades, the deu? terostomes, the lophotrochozoans, and the ecdysozoans. The Ecdysozoa include sev? eral phyla that were once classified as pseudocoelomates (nematodes, priapulids) in addition to arthropods and ony- chophorans. The proposed Ecdysozoan clade is supported by molecular evidence including ribosomal RNA sequence and the presence of characteristic Hox genes. One primary value of a redesigned (and hope- fully more accurate)animal phylogeny, in? cluding the placement of phylogenetically cryptic minor phyla within the animal tree, is the implication for evolutionary comparisons and reconstructions. The so-called minor phyla are critical for establishing ancestral conditions, both molecular and morphologi? cal, at interesting nodes in animal phylog? eny. Further, these phyla contribute to the analysis of evolutionary changes in gene function during animal evolution. For ex? ample, priapulids and onychophorans fill in the gaps in evolutionary comparisons be? tween the model organisms Drososphila (Arthropoda), C. elegans (Nematoda), and the mouse (Chordata). These and other mi? nor phyla help us to interpret the ongoing experiment that is animal evolution. 61.3 GRIFFIN, TM.*, GARCIA, S., WICKLER, S.J., HOYT, D.F, KRAM, R., Uni? versity of California, Berkeley, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, Cali? fornia State Polytechnic University, Pomona, California State Polytechnic Uni- 1034 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

Determinants of the walk-trot tran? sition and preferred walking speeds: in? sights from intra-specific size comparisons of horses. Much of our understanding of the effects of size on locomotion has come from inter- specific size comparisons (i.e. mouse-to-el- ephant).To control for phylogenetic and mor? phological differences associated with in- ter-specific comparisons, we used intra-spe- cific size variation within horses to under? stand the determinants of the walk-trot tran? sition (W-T) and preferred walking (PW) speeds. We addressed two questions: 1) Are W-T and PW speeds determined by inverted pendulum mechanics? 2) Do W-T and PW speeds minimize the metabolic cost re? quired to travel a unit distance? We studied 9 horses (Equus caballus) spanning an 8- fold range in mass (90 - 720kg) and a 2-fold range in leg length (0.7 -1.4m). W-T speeds and rates of oxygen consumption were measured during treadmill locomotion. PW speeds were measured during overground walking. To compare inverted pendulum me? chanics across size we calculated the Froude number, = v2/gL, where v is forward speed (m/s), g is gravity, and L is leg length. We found that the absolute W-T speed increased with size (1.6 to 2.3 m/s), but occurred at nearly the same Froude number (0.34). The W-T speed concurred with the metabolically optimal transition speed. The absolute PW speed increased with size up to 400kg (0.9 to 1.5 m/s) but curiously did not increase further. The PW speed coincided with the minimum metabolic cost of transport, except in the smallest horses that preferred slower than energetically optimal speeds. In gen? eral, W-T and PW speeds are tightly coupled to both inverted pendulum mechanics and metabolic energy minimization. Supported by NSF IBN-0073020, NIH S06 GM53933 and NIH AR44688.

Dietary protein restriction does not suppress humoral immune function or maternal antibody transfer in Japanese quail (coturnix coturnix japonica). The ability to resist infection is an impor? tant component of survival and lifetime re- productive success. Many current theories in ecological immunology assume that mounting and maintaining an immunologi? cal defense is energetically costly and nutri? tional resources expended on immune func? tion may necessarily be traded-off with other functions including reproduction. Females passively deposit antibodies in egg yolk dur? ing egg formation that provide the sole form of humoral immune defense for newly hatched young. To determine the influence of dietary protein on reproduction and hu? moral immunity in adults and passive anti? body transfer to eggs, I maintained adult Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) on isocaloric diets containing either the rec- ommended protein content for reproducing adults (20%) or a low protein diet (12%). Birds fed the low protein diet weighed less than control birds, and females produced fewer eggs that were smaller in size. Al? though the weight of females was positively correlated with antibody response to a novel antigen, adult antibody response did not dif? fer between dietary treatments. There was also no difference in antibody titer between eggs laid by low protein and control females. These results provide the first evidence that in Japanese quail, humoral immune func? tion is not suppressed in order to divert lim? ited protein resources to reproductive func? tion. 14.3 GRINDSTAFF, R.D.*, PYLES, R.A., East Tennessee State University Thyroid and prolactin hormones in metamorphic and paedomorphic species of ambystomatid salamanders. The endocrine control of metamorpho? sis, long identified with circulating levels of thyroid hormone and prolactin, has been studied almost exclusively in anurans with little research on hormonal control of meta? morphosis among urodeles. Comparisons of hormone levels in metamorphic and pae? domorphic salamanders should clarify the roles of tetraiodothyronine (T4) and prolac? tin in regulating the structural and functional changes associated with metamorphic pro? cesses.

Among species comparisons show T4 levels are significantly different in all developmental stages except metamorphosing Ambystoma maculatum and A. talpoideum. Overall T4 hormone con? centrations in A. mexicanum were higher than those of A. talpoideum in all develop? mental stages, contradicting the assumption that obligately paedomorphic species lack a functional thyroid gland. Higher levels of T4 in paedomorphic species suggests T4-in- duced metamorphic changes are probably regulated at target tissues, either by control? ling receptor availability or preventing con? version of T4 to triiodothyronine in periph? eral tissue. Our data also show prolactin se? cretion increases as metamorphosis con- tinues in all species, indicating prolactin is unlikely as a primary inhibitor of metamor? phosis.

Cardiac and oxidative skeletal muscles of Antarctic notothenioid fishes preferen- tially utilize lipids over carbohydrates as their main fuel for aerobic metabolism. These tissues further show a marked ten- dency to oxidize mono-unsaturated fatty acids over saturated fatty acids. We hy- pothesize that fatty acyl CoA synthetase (FACS; EC 6.2.1.3) may be the primary site dictating specificity for oxidation of long chain unsaturated fatty acids in notothenioids. Full-length FACS cDNAs from oxidative skeletal muscle of Chaenocephalus aceratus, Gobio- notothen gibberifrons, and Notothenia coriiceps were identified by RACE PCR and sequenced. Predicted proteins are 697-699 amino acids in length, with 66- 67% and 66-69% identity to rat and hu? man, respectively. Part of the fatty acid bind- ing pocket is encoded by a 25-amino acid consensus sequence or "signature motif," 1DGWLHTGDIGXWXPXGXLKIIDRKK25, which is common to all FACS. This region from three notothenioids, 532DGWLHTGDV/ IGKWLPNGCLKITDRKK556, has 76% (N coriiceps) to 80% (G. gibberifrons and C. aceratus) identity to the consensus se? quence. In all three species examined, the non-polar lie21 of the consensus se? quence is changed to a polar Thr551 resi? due. This amino acid difference may sig? nificantly impact preference for long chain unsaturated fatty acids. Additional amino acid substitutions in this binding motif may also play a role in determining the enzyme's specificity for both chain length and degree of saturation. These roles will be examined by site-directed mutagen- esis. Functional studies of the enzymes to determine substrate specificities are cur? rently underway.

Prey capture in actinopterygian fishes: a review of suction feeding motor patterns with new evidence from an elopomorph fish: Megalops atlanticus. Suction feeding has long been recog? nized as the dominant mode of prey cap? ture among ray-finned fishes. Elshoud- Oldenhave and Osse (1976) first proposed a triphasic sequence of the suction feed? ing strike: 1) a preparatory phase, 2) an expansion phase, and 3) a compression phase. I review the underlying motor ba? sis of these events during suction feeding by summarizing the major evolutionary trends identified among basal actinopterygians and advanced teleosts. One goal of this review will seek to identify functionally significant motor pattern fea? tures that are associated with major changes in the head musculature and link? age mechanics of the actinopterygian skull. Finally, the motor basis of suction feeding in the Tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) will be presented. Phylogeneti? cally, Elopomorphs are positioned inter- mediately between the Osteogloss- 1036 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Morphologically, they lack the protrusible upper jaw of advanced teleo? sts, but have a highly mobile anteriorly swinging maxilla. This group has also maintained a double coupling of mandibu? lar depression through the presence of mandibular-hyoid and interopercular- mandibular ligaments. Both these oral jaw traits are shared with the basal actinopterygian fish, Amia calva (Halecomorphi), making comparisons of suction motor patterns between these dis? tantly related species particularly interest? ing. Comparisons of Tarpon suction feed? ing motor patterns to previously docu? mented basal and advanced actinop? terygian fishes will revisit the standing paradigm that there is strong motor pat? tern conservation among the three phases of the suction feeding strike across a broad phylogenetic spectrum.

Adult crayfish pericardial organs, as in lobsters are described as emerging from the thoracic nerves and running toward the dor? sal surface of the heart, becoming fine fibers that eventually take on a beaded form. Trunks emerge between the epimeral plate and spread over a large area of the membra- nous tissue lining the lateral pericardial wall and the tissue surrounding the heart liga? ments. The PO are release sites for several neurohormones. The adult decapod heart is neurogenic, however it has been hypoth? esized that a developing embryo's heartbeat is myogenic in origin only later becoming neurogenic. While neurogenic drive arises from the cardiac ganglion, the release of neu? rohormones from the PO provides additional regulation of heart function. The current study employed methylene blue staining tech? niques to determine the development of the PO in embryonic crayfish. The heart starts beating in the Nauplius 4 stage and is pro- truding posteriorly from its future location in the pericardial cavity. In juveniles the PO appear to be even more extensive that those found in adult crayfish. The PO is present during all three larval instars. At Nauplius 6 and 7, the PO appears to be extensive in the center and anterior portion of the dorsal cara? pace even though the heart at these stages is still protruding from the posterior end of the carapace. The PO is a site for release of serotonin. In the lobster, serotonin appears as early as 10% development, and has nearly its full complement of serotonergic fibers by 40-50% development. In other in? vertebrate systems, serotonin appears to play a role in regulating the pattern of devel? opment of neurons and their connections. The appearance of extensive PO during em? bryonic stages when the heart is still myo? genic may imply an additional role for the PO during development. 35.3 GUGLIELMO, CG.*, PIERSMA, T, WILLIAMS, TD, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Netherlands Inst. for Sea Re? search, Texel, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC Flight-induced muscle dam? age and avian migration, evidence from two shorebird species. It has often been suggested that birds undergo processes of repair and physiologi? cal recovery following long distance flights, however exactly what these processes are remains mostly undescribed. High intensity, long duration exercise is known to cause muscle damage, which is a pathological phenomenon qualitatively different from the mobilization of amino acids as fuel. Acute muscle damage results in the disruption of muscle ultrastructure, leakage of muscle pro? teins into the blood, immune system re? sponse, soreness, edema, stiffness and re? duced strength. Chronic damage may lead to immunosuppression. We investigated muscle damage in two species of long-dis- tance migrant shorebirds by measuring plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity. In the Western Sandpiper (Calidris mauri), a non- synchronous, short-hop migrant, plasma CK was higher in migrants than non-migrants in two years of study. Plasma CK was higher in relatively untrained juveniles making their first migration than in adults. Bar-tailed God- 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Plasma CK was highest following arrival at the Wadden Sea and declined during the one month stop? over period. Godwits identified as late arriv- als based on plumage characteristics had significantly higher plasma CK than early arrivals. In both model systems elevated plasma CK indicated that muscle damage occurs during migration. However, the rela? tive increase in CK was modest compared to that known to indicate loss of function in other animals. High costs of muscle dam? age (e.g. predation risk) could lead to strong selection for mechanisms to avoid it. 5.2 GURALNICK, R.P., University of Colo? rado, Boulder. Reconnecting cell and ani? mal lineages: a synthetic approach to spiralian evolution and development. Tracing the timing, position, and direc? tionality of all the cell divisions from zygote up to late development is the study of cell lineages. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, American biologists at Woods Hole pioneered studies of cell lin? eages of spiral cleavers and used the data they collected in constructing evolutionary developmental scenarios. However, due to the lack of appropriate analytical frame- works, that data could not be rigorously used for either phylogenetic analysis or for test? ing major evolutionay-devlopmental ques? tions. Here, I reanalyze all available cell lin? eage data using modern statistical tech? niques (like phylogenetic analysis). I show that: 1.) Cell lineage data reconstructs a phy? logenetic hypothesis that similar but not iden? tical to the patterns found in 18S and mor? phological analyses; 2.) 4d, the mesentoblast, is a unique cell that speeds up and slows down in both equal and un- equal cleavers; 3.) Some cells that form in the same quartet at the same point in the cell lineage hierarchy have much lower variations across all Spiralia, arguing for ar? chitectural constraint or stabilizing selection. S4.9 HADFIELD, M.G., University of Hawaii, Manoa. Metamorphic competence is a ma? jor adaptive convergence in marine inverte? brate larvae. Larvae from diverse and unrelated ma- rine-invertebrate phyla are able to rapidly respond to environmental cues to settle? ment and to undergo very rapid metamorphogenesis because they share the developmental trait of metamorphic competence. This developmental state, characteristic of larvae as diverse as those of cnidarian planulae, molluscan veligers, and barnacle cyprids, is one in which nearly all requisite juvenile characters are present in the larva prior to settlement. Thus metamorphosis, in response to more or less specific environmental cues (induc- ers), is mainly restricted to loss of larva- specific organs and physiological pro? cesses. Competent larvae of two "model marine invertebrates" studied in the author's laboratory, the serpulid polycha? ete Hydroides elegans and the nudibranch Phestilla sibogae, complete metamorpho? sis in about 12 and 20 hrs, respectively. Furthermore, little or no de novo gene ac? tion appears to be required for the settle? ment and metamorphosis response in these species. Contrasting greatly with the slow, hormonally regulated metamorphic transitions of vertebrates and insects, rapid metamorphosis in marine invertebrate lar? vae is conjectured to have arisen in di? verse phylogenetic clades as a response to common environmental pressures that fa? vor extremely fast transition from larval loco? motory and feeding modes, adapted to life in the plankton, to a different set of such modes, adapted to life on the sea bottom.

In con? trast to IDDM in the streptozotocin-treated rat, in which only insulin is absent and dia? betic hyperglycemia occurs within 12 hr, the lx goby does not express significant hyperg? lycemia until after 10-15 d, suggestive of a lack of hyperglycemic action of a pancreatic factor(s) during this period. Treatment of 7-d lx gobies (not yet symptomatic) with porcine or human glucagon at 1-5 \ig/g body weight induces a significant hyperglycemia com? parable to that in fully diabetic rats or gobies (20 d post-lx). Similarly, treatment with iden? tical doses of human or coho salmon GLP-1 induces a similar hyperglycemic response in the 7-d lx goby. When liver explants from the glucagon- or GLP-1-treated lx gobies were tested in vitro, they were determined to release glucose at a 2-fold greater rate per mg tissue (p&lt;0.05) than liver explants from untreated lx gobies. These data suggest that glucagon and GLP-1 are diabetogenic fac? tors in the lx goby capable of enhancing hepatic glucose output.

Detec? tion of Na+/H+ antiporter in the gills of elas? mobranchs: little skate (Raja erinacea) and dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias). The Na+/H+exchanger (NHE) is a trans? port protein hypothesized to be involved in acid-base regulation across fish gill epithe? lia. Recent studies have shown the presence of NHE in the gill tissue of two marine teleo? sts, the long-horned sculpin, Myoxocephalus octodecimspinosus, and the killifish, Fundu? lus heteroclitus. Preliminary results suggest the presence of this protein in the gills of two elasmobranchs, the little skate (Raja erinacea) and the dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias). The aim of this study was to de? tect the protein and use the detected fragmet obtained from these two elasmobranchs to determine the further cDNA sequence for the NHE gill from Raja erinacea. The initial fragment was 470 bp in length and found to have 85% amino acid homology (71% iden? tity) to the NHE2 human isoform and close identity to the dogfish shark. Rapid amplifi? cation of cDNA ends (3f/5i RACE) was at? tempted using an NHE specific primer, pre? viously developed from the known elasmo? branch sequence, and a universal primer to amplify the skate DNA sequence. We hope to determine if the near identity of the partial fragment observed in the skate and the dog? fish will be confirmed in the full length se? quence.

Temporal dispersal: ecological and evo? lutionary implications of prolonged egg dia? pause. Zooplankton egg banks are the accu? mulation of diapausing embryos buried in the sediments of many aquatic ecosystems. These eggs, which are analogous life his? tory stages to the seeds of many plants, can survive in a ready-to-hatch state for periods ranging from decades to centuries. Their presence in ponds, lakes and near-shore marine environments has substantial impli? cations for the maintenance of biotic diver? sity, both among and within species, and for the rates and trajectories of ecological and evolutionary change. Their role in maintain? ing diversity derives from the interaction of two factors: generation overlap created by prolonged diapause and environmental fluc? tuations that cause different types (species or genotypes) to be favored at different times. Hatching of diapausing eggs influences population and community response to en? vironmental change by introducing to cur? rent environments species or genotypes laid at times in the distant past through what can be thought of as temporal dispersal. A com? pletely different aspect of egg banks derives from the fact that the sediments of lakes are often structured in historical sequence (with the most recent sediments on top and pro- gressively older sediments deeper in the lake bottom). When this is the case, dia? pausing eggs extracted from different sedi? ment ages can provide a means of studying past changes in community or population- genetic structure. These two distinct aspects 800-955-1236 ? (703)790-1745 ?

Both aspects are possible, however, when sediment-mixing intensity is spatially heterogeneous.

Evi? dence that some lesser-known "phyla" are annelids. In traditional schemes, the Annelida has been classified as the Polychaeta, Oligochaeta, and Hirudinea (the last two comprising the Clitellata). However, recent analyses indicate that annelids are much more diverse than traditionally believed, and that polychaetes are a paraphyletic group. Specifically, some lesser-known taxa (pre? viously regarded as "phyla") appear to fail within the annelid radiation. Abundant mo? lecular, developmental, and morphological data show that the Siboglinidae, which in? cludes the formerly recognized Pogonophora and Vestimentifera, are de? rived annelids; recent data from the Elonga? tion Factor - 1a (EF-1a) gene also suggest that echiurids are of annelid ancestry. In contrast, two other lesser-known groups of marine worms, the Myzostomida and Sipuncula, do not appear to be closely re? lated to the annelids. With advances in our understanding of annelid phylogeny, our perceptions of body plan evolution within the Metazoa are being profoundly changed. For example, the evolution of segmentation is probably more plastic than traditionally believed.

Par? tial purification of a postmolt cuticular gly- cosidase from Callinectes sapidus and its putative role in mineralization. We have previously demonstrated a marked change in sugar moieties of glyco- proteins of the cuticle of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, between 0.5 and 3 h postecdysis. The present study has identi? fied a glycosidase that appears in the cu? ticle during the early postecdysial hours. The enzyme has affinities for p-nitrophenyl de- rivatives of both N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine. Both activities are competitively inhibited by chitobiose, sug? gesting that the enzyme could be a N- acetylhexosaminidase (HexNAcase). Atypi- cal of HexNAcases described to date, this enzyme has a pH optimum of 7.0. The en? zyme activity is high during the postecdysial period coincident with the changes in glyco? protein profiles observed in vivo. Partial pu? rification of the enzyme has been accom? plished by Sephacryl size-exclusion chro? matography followed by Concanavalin A (ConA) affinity chromatography. To test if a HexNAcase might be the causative agent in the alteration of the glycans and initiation of calcification, newly molted crab cuticle was treated with exogenous HexNAcase. Treat- ing cuticular extracts from crabs at 0 h postecdysis with exogenous HexNAcase mimicked those changes observed in vivo. Specifically, the enzyme decreased the ConA affinity of an 83 kDa glycoprotein that binds to calcite crystals in vitro. Treating pieces of 0 h postecdysial cuticle with HexNAcase rendered them capable of nucleating cal? cite in vitro (similar to 5 h postecdysial cu? ticle), while untreated, 0 h controls remained uncalcified. The data imply a role of the cu? ticular HexNAcase-like enzyme in the initia? tion of calcite nucleation in the newly formed exoskeleton. 1.6 HALE, M.E., SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY. Fast start behaviors of fish lacking Mauthner neurons. The paired Mauthner neurons (M-cells) are used by fishes to initiate the C-start type of startle response. During C-starts, a fish turns rapidly away from an offending stimu? lus with a "C" shaped body bend. Mauthner neurons may also function in S-starts, in which the initial bend of the body is "S" shaped. While the large majority of fish taxa 1040 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="117">have M-cells, in a few species they have been secondarily lost. By examining the startle response of one of these species, the toadfish (Opsanus tau), this study investi- gates the role of M-cells and other large reticulospinal interneurons in fast-start be? haviors. EMGs of axial, pectoral fin, and jaw muscle and high-speed video of responses to touch stimuli were recorded. Toadfish were found to perform both C-starts and S-starts. The C-start behavior was used by toadfish as part of several different behavioral re? sponses. It could follow the stimulus directly or be preceded by fin movements and lung? ing and biting at the stimulus probe. This suggests that C-start behavior can function in many behaviors without the reflexive M- cell response to the stimulus. While the pat? tern of the toadfish C-start was like that of a M-cell elicited response, aspects of perfor? mance were decreased indicating that the alternative neural mechanisms by which the C-start behavior pattern is generated in toad? fish do not compensate for the lack of large reticulospinal interneurons. S-starts were more consistent than C-starts with little varia? tion in the response. Toadfish have a short latency, high performance S-start behavior similar to that of fishes with Mauthner neu? rons. This suggests that the M-cell may not be needed for S-start escape behavior.

Here the hypothesized relationship between increased relative eye size and flight is evaluated using actual measures of eye size in both bats and birds: Megachiroptera, Psittaciformes, Columbiformes, Pro- celliformes, Falconiformes, and Strigiformes. Eyeball axial diameters and the density of water are used to estimate eye mass, and are then compared to body mass figures either estimated from wing length or culled from the literature. This study confirms that Plasticine modeling from dry skulls is a reliable method of esti? mating eye mass. It also confirms previ? ous work demonstrating that eye mass scales with negative allometry relative to body mass. Although eye and body mass scale with negative allometry in all groups studied, the scaling relationships differ be? tween groups. This suggests that taxon- specific factors other than size influence eye mass. Leuckart's Law, that swifter mov? ing animals have larger eyes, receives scant support from these data: Nocturnality is also an important determinant of large eyes among birds. Megachiropteran bats have relatively smaller eyes than birds and other nonvolant mammals, such as pri? mates, lagomorphs, many treeshrews, and elephant shrews. Flight per se does not necessitate relatively larger eyes more than do other factors, although the rela? tively large eyes of birds remain unex- plained. Extension of this study to fossil relatives of birds promises to be interest? ing in this regard. S8.7 HALLETT, M., Mark Hallett Paleoart. Anatomical principles of reconstructing ex? tinct organisms and their uses in entertain- ment art. Dinosaurs and other extinct organism are rarely known from anatomical systems other than the skeletal system. Nonetheless, a detailed interpretation of muscular structure is prerequisite to responsible reconstruc- tions. Detailed muscular reconstructions take into account bony landmarks of muscular attachment, but for those muscles that do not leave obvious marks of attachment on bones, or in animals too small to express heavy rugosities of muscular attachment, artists engaging in paleontological recon? struction necessarily draw on a thorough consideration of comparative anatomy. Knowledge of internal organs' structure is also critical to correctly proportioning 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

This integrated approach is employed not only in painted and sculptural reconstructions, but also in modeling animals for animated and photorealistic digital films. In the case of ani? mated character design in films like Juras? sic Park and Dinosaur, computer animators must necessarily simplify body motions rela? tive to the actual muscles that made the ani? mals move. However, athorough understand? ing of the movements produced by actual muscle groups is necessary before such simplification may take place. In film, recon? struction of dinosaurs and other animals logi- cally proceeds to certain aspects of visual development. Visual development of char? acters and scenes allows the paleoartist to experiment with a broad range of sugges- tions for character design. Character design encompasses considerations from surface texture and coloration to individual and group behaviors. Such considerations are not random. Rather, they, again, derive from studies of similarly sized large vertebrates from similar environments. Not surprisingly, large mammals often provide a framework and guide to speculation regarding dino? saurs. P1.6 HAMILTON, HC.*, GAREY, J.R., Uni? versity of South Florida. Applying molecular techniques to environmental studies of meiofauna. The purpose of this study is to develop sequence tags for a set of marine meiobenthic fauna (meiofauna). We have shown that DNA of meiofaunal origin can be extracted directly from sediment samples. We have also shown that primers for the 18S rRNA gene can be used to amplify the meiofaunal DNA while excluding bacterial, plant, and fungi DNA. We cloned and se? quenced the amplified DNA and found that all clones belonged to meiofaunal organ? isms, mainly copepods and nematodes. We have identified the harpacticoid copepod species Longipedia helgolandica and a laophontid species, as well as the nema- tode species Metachromadora pulvinata, from sediment samples taken from Tampa Bay and extracted DNA from isolated speci? mens of the two harpacticoids. The 18S rRNA gene was PCR amplified from the extracted DNA and sequenced using an automated sequencer. The 18S rRNA sequence was then assembled and aligned. From the align? ment, we have identified a variable loop that would be suitable for identifying the specific meiofauna species. This 20 to 25 base se? quence was used to construct a sequence tag called a molecular beacon. The molecu? lar beacon is a fluorescent molecule con? taining the short target sequence that can be used to identify species of meiofauna with? out having to sort them from the sediment and identify them by morphology. The DNA of the meiofauna can be extracted directly from sediment samples and the 18S rRNA gene PCR amplified. The molecular beacon can then be used to identify and quantify meiofauna species of interest. 52.2 HAMMER, H.S.*, WATTS, S.A., LAWRENCE, J.M., LAWRENCE, A.L., MCCLINTOCK, J.B., University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Alabama at Bir? mingham, University of South Florida, Tampa, Texas A&amp;M University, PortAransas, Univer? sity of Alabama at Birmingham. The effect of dietary protein concentration on gonad com? position and gametic condition in the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus. Ecological studies suggest that nutrition, particularly dietary protein, affects nutrient storage and reproductive competency. Starved urchins (ca. 36 mm diameter, n=12) were held in replicated (3x) 80 L aquaria with artificial seawater at 21 C and 32 ppt salinity for each diet treatment. The urchins were fed one of three isocaloric diets con? taining 14 (L), 32 (M) or 50% (H) protein ad libitum for a 10-week period. The mean go? nad index increased from 0.3 to 10.7, 11.3, and 12.7 for the L, M, and H protein diets, respectively. The gonad contained 25.7,31.2, and 41.2% protein and 47.3, 39.7, and 24.6% carbohydrate for the L, M, and H pro? tein diets, respectively. Lipid level averaged 19-22 % and did not vary significantly with diet.

Limits to whole-animal performance may be a result of peripheral effectors, central supportive organs, or both ("symmorphosis"). We examined these concepts using aero? bic performance in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). We correlated the masses of peripheral (foreleg and hind leg muscles) and central organs (liver, kidney, spleen, heart, lung and gut) with basal metabolic rate and maximal aerobic metabolism dur? ing tread-mill running (BMR and V02max, respectively). We found that, with the excep? tion of the small intestine, female mice had consistently larger guts than those of male mice. Male mice had larger combined leg muscle masses than female mice, but nei? ther fore- nor hind-leg muscle alone was dif? ferent between the sexes. We also found positive correlations between foreleg muscle mass and heart mass in both sexes. Despite the large variation in organ and muscle mass, and metabolic rates, we found no cor? relations between organ or muscle mass and V02max although there was a positive correlation between BMR and hindleg muscle mass in both sexes. These data indi? cate that increased aerobic performance is not necessarily predicated upon possession of increased central or peripheral organs. Because deer mice have high aerobic per? formance at high altitudes, it will be interest? ing to determine if deer mice reared and tested at high altitude have stronger or dif? ferent correlations than mice reared and tested at low altitudes.

The synthesis of ecdysteroid hormones by crustacean Y-organs is negatively regu? lated by molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH); a neuropeptide synthesized and released from eyestalk neurosecretory cells. Several lines of evidence suggest that the suppressive ef? fect of MIH on Y-organ ecdysteroid synthesis is mediated by an increase in intracellular cAMRTo better understand the link between MIH receptor occupancy and Y-organ cAMP levels, we have assessed the presence of GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) in Y-or? gans of the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus). We report here the presence of G-proteins in Y-organs and control (neural) tissue as determined by (1) ADP-ribosylation cata- lyzed by bacterial toxins and (2) western blot analysis using antibodies raised against mammalian G-proteins. A pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G-protein (~ 45 kD) was de? tected in both thoracic ganglia and Y-organs. A cholera toxin (CTX)-sensitive G-protein (~ 49 kD) was detected in ganglia, but not in Y- organs. Western blot analysis, using anti? bodies raised against either G-alpha or G- alpha-s, revealed an immunoreactive pro? tein of - 49 kD in both ganglia and Y-organs. The combined results indicate that Gi-like and Gs-like proteins exist in Y-organs and thoracic ganglia of blue crabs. We are cur? rently assessing the functional role of G-pro? teins in ecdysteroidogenesis.

To analyze these costs, Dipsosaurus (n=25) were run at a maximal treadmill intensity (2.4 m/s) for 15 see while V02 was monitored. Animals were removed and sacrificed at rest, directly post-exercise or following 3, 10 or 60 min of recovery. Hindquarters were im- mediately freeze-clamped and the gastroe- nemius (GAS), red iliofibularis (rIF) and white iliofibularis (wIF) were analyzed for ATP, phos- phocreatine (PCr), and lactate (LA) using HPLC. GAS resting levels measured 8.7 mM ATP, 40.3 mM PCr and 4.0 mM LA and were more similar to wIF than rIF in all measures. Post-exercise ATP decreased 13%, PCr de? creased 78% and LA increased 966%. ATP showed the greatest decrease in wIF, while PCr showed the greatest decrease in rIF. PCr and ATP returned to resting levels within 3- 10 min, while LA remained above resting levels for the entire 60 min. V02 recovery required 44 min and EPOC measured 0.104 ml 0,/g. Modeling of individual components of EPOC indicate the majority of energetic outlay may be due to phosphagen replen- ishment (28%); glyconeogenic lactate re? moval (42%); and catecholamine stimula? tion (17%). Phosphagen replenishment is complete during the first 10 min of EPOC and would require 67% of 02 consumption during this time. Glyconeogenesis likely does not begin until after this time and would ac? count for 72% of EPOC from 10 to 44 min. This model is sensitive to assumptions of % active muscle, P:0 ratios and lactate fate which will be discussed. NSF#97240140. P1.63HANCOCK, TV*, GLEESON, T T, University of Colorado. The tradeoff between endurance and metabolic costs using inter? mittent locomotion in the desert iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis). The elevated 02 consumption (V02) ob? served during recovery from activity incurs additional metabolic costs to the animal be? yond that seen during activity. These costs are also realized during intermittent activity, alternating exercise and rest, where V02 is high during rest. Utilizing a rapid fatiguing exercise intensity (4x maximum aerobic speed=1.08 m/s), Dipsosaurus (n=10) were run for varying durations (5, 15 or 30 see) and pauses (1,2,4 or 8 x the activity period). Distance capacity, the total distance summed from all activity intervals and reflecting en? durance, increased significantly versus con? tinuous locomotion for most protocols. The largest increases were seen when the activ? ity period was limited to 5 see and the pause period was extended to 5, 20 and 40 see (55, 118 and 193 m). To assess the meta? bolic costs incurred from these regimens en- abling increased endurance, V02 was mea? sured for six periods of 5 see activity sepa? rated by either 5, 20, or 40 see (n=8). The total excess oxygen consumption (TEOC) was measured as the sum of additional 02 consumption during activity, pauses and re? covery. TEOC increased significantly from 0.08 to 0.09 and 0.12 ml O/g, respectively. As animals traveled the same distance for all 3 regimens, the most expensive strategy per distance traveled was also the one which provided the greatest endurance. The in? crease in TEOC was primarily due to a sig? nificant increase in 02 consumed during pause intervals as pause duration increased, while recovery V02 did not differ significantly. The concomitant increase in endurance seen is possibly due to a larger repletion of metabolites or elimination of end products during longer rest periods allowing addi? tional bouts of activity to be performed. NSF#97240140. S4.6 HAND, S.C, Louisiana State Univer? sity Induction of quiescence and diapause during life cycles of aquatic invertebrates: mechanisms and implications. With one exception, all major animal phyla contain species that display dormancy at certain points in their life cycles, a feature that affords tolerance to harsh or ephemeral habitats. Diapause is an obligate, develop- mentally-programmed form of dormancy that precedes the onset of environmental insult. Under conditions that normally promote ac? tivity and development, calorimetric/respiro- metric studies have revealed that major metabolic depressions accompany entry into diapause in aquatic invertebrates like sponge gemmules and brine shrimp em? bryos. This depression occurs rather slowly over a period of several days. Release from diapause can be promoted by various envi- 1044 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="121">ronmental ques and artificial chemical fac? tors. Metabolism increases 500-fold or more. In contrast to diapause, quiescence is a type of dormancy directly induced by an environ? mental stress like oxygen deprivation. Data from many aquatic species show that survi? vorship under anoxia is proportional to the degree of metabolic depression. There is a suite of molecular mechanisms underlying these metabolic and developmental pat? terns. In the nucleo-cytoplasmic and mito? chondrial compartments, gene expression is severely depressed at transcriptional and translational levels, as assessed by nuclear run-on and cell-free translation assays. Di? rect measurements of protein and mRNA half-lives indicate that macromolecular turn? over is greatly reduced. Stress proteins of low molecular mass undergo intracellular translocation to the nucleus. These and other molecular changes associated with natural states that border on suspended animation provide clues as to how other cells might be placed into stasis.

Water content ofthe gall regulates susceptibility to inoculative freezing in larvae of the goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis. We examined seasonal changes in sus? ceptibility to inoculative freezing in larvae of the freeze-tolerant goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera, Tephritidae). During the autumn the goldenrod plant senesces and the water content of the gall decreases markedly from &gt;50% to near 10%. In late September, when galls were green and water content was - 55%, more than half of the larvae within their galls froze when held at -2.5/C for 24 h and nearly all larvae froze when held -4 or -6/C. How? ever, at this time less than 15% of larvae survived freezing at -6/C. Gall water con? tent decreased to 33% in October and the number of larvae that froze at -4 and h6/C also decreased though the proportion of lar? vae that survived freezing increased mark? edly. By November, gall water content dropped to its lowest value (10%) and few larvae froze during exposure to subzero tem? peratures. During the winter, rain and melt- ing snow transiently increased gall water content to values as high as 64% which caused many larvae to freeze at tempera? tures as high as -4/C. However, during pe? riods of no precipitation the gall tissues dried and, as before, larvae were not as suscep- tible to inoculative freezing. These results indicate that in nature larvae may freeze earlier in the autumn and/or at higher tem? peratures than would be predicted based on the supercooling point of isolated larvae. P2.63 HANNAFORD, S.J., University of Puget Sound. Role of venation in the sup? port and deformabilty of dipteran wings dur? ing flight. Wing deformations have been shown in virtually all flying animals thus far studied and are most pronounced during hovering, maneuvering, and slow flight. Despite the universality of deformations during flight, the possible functional significance of such de? formations is a matter of dispute. Some in? vestigators regard the wing as essentially rigid, and suggest that effect of wing defor? mations on flight kinematics is negligible. Others investigators have suggested that some deformations in wing shape during flight may actually be necessary to produce adequate net lift and thrust. To gain a better understanding of the role of wing deforma? tions in insect flight, I measured the net lift, thrust, and wing blade strain in a scaled model of Drosophila wings during flight. Five wing morphologies with different wing ve? nation patterns were considered. Increas? ing the stability of the wing via the addition of veins decreased the magnitude of the deformations in the wing. The morphologi? cal arrangement of the wing veins also af? fected the spatial and temporal patterns of wing deformations produced during the wing beat cycle. Additional goals included deter? mining whether varying the wing rigidity af? fected the net thrust and lift produced during flight and determining if the relative forces produced by various Drosophila flight kine? matic patterns were affected by varying the wing venation pattern. 800-955-1236 ?

The cystic fibrosis trans? membrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. CFTR is a phosphorylation-regulated chloride channel and member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter super? family of proteins. There have been no re? ports of CFTR homologues in invertebrate animals although ABC transporters are found in virtually all organisms from bacte? ria to humans. The hindgut of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria expresses a cAMP-activated chloride conductance remi? niscent of CFTR. We carried out preliminary RT-PCR studies using RNA from this tissue. Several primer sets failed to amplify CFTR- like products. A search of the Drosophila genome revealed many putative ABC trans? porters but none having the regulatory (R) domain diagnostic of CFTR. Thus CFTR may have appeared late in evolution compared to other ABC transporters and channels. CFTR channels rapidly deactivate in excised membrane patches suggesting they may be associated with a membrane-bound phos? phatase. We tested that possibility using co- immunoprecipitation and crosslinking stud? ies. A monoclonal anti-CFTR antibody co- precipitated PP2C (but not PP1, PP2A or PP2B) from cells stably expressing CFTR. Conversely, a polyclonal anti-PP2C antibody co-precipitated CFTR from membrane ex? tracts. When cell lysates were exposed to the bifunctional crosslinking reagent dithiobis [sulfosuccinimidyl propionate] (DTSSP), histidine-tagged CFTR (CFTRHis10) and PP2C became crosslinked into high mo? lecular weight complexes that could be iso? lated by chromatography on Ni2+-NTA aga? rose. PP1, PP2A and PP2B were not co- purified. These results suggest CFTR and PP2C exist in a stable complex that facili- tates regulation of the channel. SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry are being used to identify the PP2C isoform. 70.1 HARPER, SL, REIBER, CL, Univer? sity of Nevada Las Vegas. Deviants of gas exchange: adaptations of the tadpole shrimp. Tadpole shrimp Triops longicaudatus in? habiting a rock pool in southern Nevada ex? perience prolonged hypoxia. Diel oxygen concentrations (Po2) in the pool range from 0-20 kPa 02. Tadpole shrimp were reared under low (1-3 kPa) and high (10-13 kPa) Po2's to determine the influence of rearing Po2 on adult responses to hypoxic stress and to determine the regulatory mechanisms employed by tadpole shrimp to deal with both chronic and acute hypoxia. Respira? tory surface area is significantly decreased in animals reared under chronic hypoxia. This decrease is presumably due to limited oxy? gen available to fuel metabolic anabolism and formation of larger respiratory append? ages. Accessory respiratory surfaces, such as the hindgut, aid in the diffusion of oxygen into the animal regardless of their rearing environment but appear to primarily assist smaller anaimals in extracting supplemen- tal oxygen. This is ecologically important be? cause smaller tadpole shrimp cannot regu? late oxygen uptake as readily as larger, more mature animals. Ventialtory rates and vol? umes do not change with varying oxygen tensions, however, oxygen extraction in? creases significantly under low oxygen con? centrations in both field and experimental animals. Tadpole shrimp from the rock pool in Brownstone Canyon appear to be highly adapted to the low oxygen concentrations prevalent in the pool. S12.7 HARRISON, J.F., Arizona State Uni? versity, Tempe.

Phillips first provided data to support the hypothesis that active, regu? lated secretion of acid by the grasshopper hindgut functions as a pH regulatory mecha? nism. Subsequent studies by Phillips and co-workers, and our laboratory have strongly supported this hypothesis. First, it is clear that insects in general, and grasshoppers in particular have a strong need for acid-base regulation. Grasshoppers experience strong 1046 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="123">variation in acid-base loading due to varia? tion in diet, body size (metabolic rate) and feeding state, yet regulate hemolymph acid- base status closely. Ingestion of plant sec? ondary compounds (terpenes) also strongly modifies acid-base excretion, probably due to metabolism and subsequent excretion of ingested compounds. Second, the hindgut appears to have a dominant role in acid- base regulation of grasshoppers. In grass? hoppers, the ventilatory system regulates internal PC02, and feedback mechanisms as? sociated with this process contribute to acid- base homeostasis. However, the bulk of the recovery in extracellular pH in response to nonvolatile acid-base challenges occurs without changes in ventilation or hemolymph PC02. Diets which are associated with in? creased fecal acid excretion are associated with more acidic hindgut lumens, but similar p's in other sections of the gut lumen. Injec? tion of acid into the hemolympH is associ? ated with compensatory variation in the gut lumen of the Malpighian tubules, ileum and rectum. We used chromium and cobalt EDTA as markers of in vivo fluid flow, and then estimated acid secretion by the various gut segments from fluid flow rates, lumen buffer values, and the pH change associ? ated with acid injection. These estimates suggest that the bulk of acid-base regula? tion in response to injection of acid into the hemocoel can be attributed to variation in hindgut acid-base transport.

Dis? tribution of an invasive anomuran decapod,petrolisthes armatus,in the north inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Re? search Reserve on the South Carolina coast. Petrolisthes armatus is a filter-feeding crab which appears to be extending its range northward along the southeast coast of the United States. P armatus is native to Brazil and has been reported from Florida, Missis? sippi, Georgia and Charleston, South Caro? lina. Recently, P armatus was found in the North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) 60 miles north of Charleston, but it has not been detected in Murrells Inlet, 20 miles further north. This is a preliminary and ongoing project to study the distribution and biology of P armatus in the North Inlet-Winyah Bay NERR and to monitor its northward movement. Sampling of P armatus is conducted by randomly se? lecting sites on oyster bars in subtidal and lower intertidal zones and placing five 0.135 m2 trays filled with oyster rubble at each zone. Trays are collected after one month and all P. armatus individuals are counted, sexed and measured for carapace width. Samples from July 2000 at three sites in North Inlet yielded an average of 34.8 individuals/m2 in the subtidal zone (range: 0-103/m2)and 70.4 individuals/m2 in the intertidal(range: 0-370/ m2). Sex ratios were male-biased in both tidal zones: 1.5:1 subtidal and 1.7:1 inter? tidal. Future studies in the laboratory and field will examine substrate preference, movement of P armatus over tidal cycles and behavioral interactions between xanthid crabs and P armatus.

Stable iso- topes in exhaled C02 and the assessment of substrate metabolism in flying birds. It is difficult to measure metabolic sub? strate use in flying birds. Indirect calorimetry can be used for short periods of time in wind tunnels but is not easily used in the field. Blood metabolite concentrations have be? come increasingly popular as indicators of metabolic substrates in freely flying birds. However, measuring blood metabolites does not directly measure metabolic sub? strate use. We suggest that the application of stable isotope analysis offers a more di? rect method of measuring metabolic sub? strates, particularly when applied in concert with the measurement of blood metabolites. Stored body lipids are depleted in 13C rela? tive to the diet, whereas carbohydrates are not. Consequently, breath C02 reflects the metabolic substrate at sampling time. We have demonstrated in trained tippler pigeons that naturally occurring 13C /12C ratios in ex? haled C02 provide a measure of the relative contribution of carbohydrates and lipids to flight metabolism. Manipulating isotope sig? natures in the diet promises to increase the usefulness and resolution of this method. 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

W, ESKEW, M.R., JULIANO, S.A., Illinois State Univer? sity Maximum titers of vitellogenin and stor? age protein occur during the canalized phase of grasshopper oogensis. Many organisms meet the challenge of unpredictable environmental conditions by remaining developmentally flexible early in their development and only later enter a canalized (inflexible) phase of development. Our ultimate goal is to understand the physi? ological mechanisms that underlie this strat? egy in a clutch-laying grasshopper (Romalea microptera). We examined the re? lationships of protein titers and the transi? tion from flexible to inflexible reproduction. Titers of both storage proteins (SPs) and vitellogenin (VG, a precursor of yolk protein) are low in the first half of the oviposition cycle and increase to maxima in the second half of the cycle. To produce defined canalized phases, we raised hoppers on four diets that varied in their quantity of food: 1) high; 2) high switched to low; 3) low switched to high; 4) low. Serial hemolymph samples were col? lected every 4 days until oviposition, and the maximum levels of VG (VGmax) and SPs (SPmax) for each individual (and age at which they occurred) were determined. We ob? served no effect on VGma levels, but SPmav max ' max levels in hoppers fed diets 3 and 4 were half that of hoppers fed diets 1 and 2. The time from eclosion to VGmax was significantly greater in hoppers fed diets 3 and 4, whereas the time from VGmax to oviposition was not. Similarly, time from eclosion to SPmax was significantly greater in hoppers fed diets 3 and 4, whereas the time from SPmax to ovi? position was not. These data show that VGmax and SPmax are physiological landmarks as? sociated with the canalized phase of oogen? esis in grasshoppers. We hypothesize that factors that inhibit the increase of VG and SP titers may be involved in the initiation of ca? nalization.

Field biologists often must work with ani? mals for which there is no prior history. A physiological marker of an animal's age would offer insight into how age and experi? ence affect reproductive success and other life history parameters. The length of telom- eres, theprotective caps on the ends of chro? mosomes, has been shown to shorten with age in humans. Our objective was to deter? mine if telomere restriction fragments cleaved from blood cell DNA would shorten as birds aged, thus providing a relatively non-invasive way to estimate ages of ani? mals. We took blood samples from fourteen zebra finches placed in three age groups, juvenile (&lt; 2 months old, n=5), young (12 to 13 months old, n=5) and old (&gt; 24 months, n=4). The DNA was extracted from isolated erythrocyte nuclei, digested, and separated on a nondenaturing agarose gel. The gel was dried and hybridized with 32P-labeled (C3TA2)4 oligonucleotides and telomere re? striction fragments were than visualized us? ing a phosphor screen. Mean telomere length was determined using densitometry. Telomere length decreased with age in the zebra finches (ANOVA, F211 = 7.18, P = .01) Juvenile birds had longer telomere frag? ments than old birds (juvenile = 71901207 bp, old = 60081232 bp;Tukey-Kramer HSD, P &lt; .05). In young birds, telomere length (66751 232) was intermediate to that of ju? veniles and adults. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in a non-human study, of a change in telomere length with age. It may be possible, in the field, to esti? mate ages of animals with nucleated eryth? rocytes once the relationship between te? lomere length and age has been determined. This would allow the incorporation of age into estimates of factors affecting life history parameters in cases where previous histo? ries of animals in the population are un- known.

Seven sub? species occur in separate regions from Cape 1048 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="125">Cod to western Texas. At the beginning of last century terrapin numbers were drasti- cally reduced because of exploitation for the soup trade. Since commercial harvest be? came unprofitable in the 1920s, most popu? lations have recovered. However, terrapins face new human threats: habitat destruction and fragmentation, pollution, motor boating, and traffic that kills nesting females. Inci? dental killing by crab trapping is considered to be one of the major threats. Currently little is known about the population genetic struc? ture and mating biology. According to mark- recapture data, terrapins have high site fi- delity, staying in the same tidal creeks for many years. We are initiating studies to as? sess the effective population size, breeding structure, and impacts of human activities for terrapin populations from coastal South Carolina and Georgia using microsatellite DNA markers. Results on the isolation of microsatellite markers and preliminary data on the genetic population structure will be presented. 50.2 HAYES, K.H.*, KARL, S.A., University of South Florida, Tampa. Evolution of the Icorona complex? within the genus Melongena (Gastropoda:Melongenidae): evidence from internal transcribed spacers and microsatellite data. Gastropods are an exceptionally speciose and diverse group of marine in? vertebrates, having undergone numerous adaptive radiations during their long evolu? tionary history. This diversity combined with their conspicuousness in the marine envi? ronment make them ideal organisms for the study of evolution in marine invertebrates. Gastropods in the genus Melongena offer a particularly intriguing opportunity to study the evolution of intertidal invertebrates. Pres? ently, despite the use of traditional morpho? logical analysis in conjunction with data from the current geographic distribution, system? atic relationships and the evolutionary his? tory ofthe ICorona Complex? remam unclear. Additonal techniques will be required to gain a better understanding of the evolution of this species complex. Using Ribosomal in? ternal transcribed spacer DNA sequences and microsatellite allele frequencies we are addressing some of the more difficult ques- tions concerning the evolution within this ge? nus. These data will allow the interpretation of present-day distribution patterns, past and present population parameters and the re? lationships within the species complex. They also can provide an understanding of the events that have led to these patterns and a clearer assessment of speciation in this marine invertebrate. S9.3 HAYES, T. B., University of California, Berkeley Evolutionary developmental en? docrinology and behaviorial ecology: an in? tegrative approach to understanding the stress response in western toads (Bufo boreas). We showed that exogenous corticoster? one (CORT) decreased growth and devel? opment in early larval stages, but increased development and stimulated metamorpho? sis during later stages in the western toad (Bufo boreas). Later, we showed that endog? enous CORT increased with larval density, while growth and development decreased. Furthermore, we recently showed that inhib? iting CORT-synthesis with metyrapone pre? vented the inhibition of growth and develop? ment associated with crowding. Thus, our data support a natural role for CORT in regu? lating the response to crowding in this spe? cies. Here, we propose an adaptive model, in which crowded larvae in a natural popu? lation may grow and develop slower in re? sponse to increased CORT during early stages. On the contrary, older (or later-staged larvae) will accelerate development and metamorphosis in response to crowding, thereby alleviating some of the crowding stress. The adaptive significance of the model is increased if Bufo boreas shows kin recognition and preferentially schools with siblings, as shown in the literature. Kin rec? ognition would increase inclusive fitness: Once older siblings metamorphose (allevi? ating crowding), then younger sibs would have the opportunity to develop faster and metamorphosis, as opposed to intense com? petition between all larvae. An examination of mixed versus pure sib groups could not identify a difference between these groups in their response to crowding. Thus the pro? posed strategy can be realized only if tad? poles truly show kin recognition and/or if 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Digestibility of native and exotic food plants eaten by juvenile desert tortoises. Exotic plants can comprise a major component of the diet for some desert tor? toises (Gopherus agassizii) in the Mojave Desert. Introduced plants may not be as nutritious as native plants. Nutrient avail? ability in a native grass (Achnatherum hymenoides), an introduced grass (Schismus barbatus), a native forb (Malacothrix glabrata) and an introduced forb (Erodium cicutarium) were measured in one to two year old juvenile desert tor? toises. We fed tortoises measured amounts of chopped foods daily for -130 days (dry grass) or -90 days (fresh or thawed forb). Orts and feces were col? lected daily and dried to constant mass, and energy, water, calcium, phosphorus, and nitrogen content of food and feces were measured. Apparent dry matter and energy digestibilities (percent of ingested material retained) were low for A. hymenoides and S. barbatus (dry matter 42% and 45%; energy 39% and 45%, re? spectively), and did not differ significantly between grass species. Apparent dry matter digestibility was higher for M. glabrata (56%) and E cicutarium (71%). Tortoises did not grow while feeding on either grass; mass changes were prima? rily due to water imbalances. Tortoises grew on both forb diets. Voluntary intake rates were higher for the forbs than for the grasses. Therefore, the higher growth rates for forbs were the result of both higher in? take rate and higher digestibility of these foods. Adult tortoises fed the same diets had similar digestibilities as did the juve? nile tortoises. Dietary digestibility is better explained by the type of food (forb vs. grass) than by its geographic origin (na? tive vs. exotic). 22.5 HEDRICK, T.L*, TOBALSKE, B.W., BIEWENER, A.A., Harvard University, Uni- versity of Portland, Harvard University 3D kinematic analysis of lift production over a range of speeds in ring-necked doves and cockatiels. A central problem limiting our understand? ing of the aerodynamics of avian flight is the lack of 3D kinematic data of wing motion. The lift generated by a wing is proportional to 1) the square of incurrent air velocity (i.e. the velocity resulting from the bird's forward progress and the motion of its wings), 2) the wingis angle of attack, and 3) wingspan, all of which may be altered by a bird with flex? ible, flapping wings moving along a 3D path. To help clarify which of these parameters birds actually vary to fly at different speeds, we investigated 3D wing kinematics of cock? atiels (Nymphicus hallandicus) and ring- necked doves (Streptopelia risoria) as they flew in a variable-speed wind tunnel at speeds of 1 to 15 m/s. To reconstruct the 3D coordinates of points marked on the wing and body, we used a direct linear transfor? mation to merge the 2D views provided by 4, synchronized, Redlake high-speed video cameras (250 Hz). During downstroke in both species we found that angle of attack varied fourfold over the range of speeds stud? ied, while incurrent air velocity varied by less than twofold and wingspan varied only slightly. Thus, flapping birds primarily ma- nipulate lift generation over a range of speeds by varying angle of attack and sec- ondarily by changing the downstroke veloc? ity of the wing.

The effect of surface grades on the joint kinematics of quail during run? ning. Locomotion is a major component to most animals' daily energy budgets. Button Quail (Coturnix chinensis) are ground foragers and therefore spend a predominant amount of time walking and running.

Deceleration occurs at the beginning of the step from when the foot strikes the ground until the middle of the stance. During this time potential energy can be stored in the elastic tendons and muscles. We quantified deceleration as the total amount of flexion at each joint. On the other hand, acceleration occurs at the end of the stance phase when the animal is pushing itself forward. This is the energetically expensive phase of the step. We quantified acceleration as the total amount of extension at each joint. We used a high speed digital camera to film Button Quail running on a motorized treadmill on a level surface, two inclines (10o and 20 o) and a decline (10 o).The Quail had markers on their lower limb joints for the purpose of digital analysis. We found that flexion at the ankle and knee joints decreased with in? creasing inciine and that extension of the ankle, knee and hip joints increased with increasing inciine. These results suggest that as animals run uphill there is an overall de? crease in the potential for storing elastic en? ergy in the tendons and muscles and that more energy must be devoted to the accel? eration phase of the step. 12.1 HELMUTH, B.*t HOFMANN, G.E., University South Carolina, Arizona State University Defining thermal stress in the rocky intertidal: linking ecology and physiology through biophysics. Thermal stress is thought to be an impor? tant determinant of organismal distribution, abundance, and productivity in the rocky in? tertidal zone. Yet, we know surprisingly little of how body temperatures change in space and time, and of how these changes trans- late into physiological stress. We monitored the body temperatures of intertidal mussels (Mytilus californianus) at a site in central California for a period of two years, at inter? vals of 5-10 minutes, on both horizontal and vertical, north-facing rock surfaces. Results showed strong effects of substrate, and mus? sels on north-facing slopes were often more than 10/ cooler than those on adjacent hori? zontal surfaces. Body temperatures were only very poorly correlated with air tempera? tures, and differed substantially from tern- perature data recorded by adjacent loggers (Tidbits) placed directly on the rock surface or within mussel beds. We concurrently measured levels of two molecular chaper? ones from the 70 kDa heat shock family (hsp70/hsc70) at intervals of 3-4 months. These proteins served as biochemical indi? cators of stress to the protein pool and pro? vided insight into protein homeostasis in each population of mussels. The data showed that mussels on horizontal surfaces had higher levels of Hsps than those from the north-facing locations, indicating that animals on horizontal surfaces were more frequently exposed to thermal conditions that would denature cellular proteins, disrupt protein homeostasis and thus, require more chaperone molecules to address the large population of non native proteins. Our re? sults show that levels of thermal stress within an intertidal site vary substantially in space and time, and that only through a combined biochemical and biophysical approach can we understand patterns in thermal stress in the rocky intertidal zone. 62.3 HENDERSON, S.Y, University of Washington, Seattle. Adult nutrition on juve? nile growth in Bugula pacifica. Bugula pacifica supplies nutrients to de? veloping brooded larvae through a pla- centa-like attachment. Previous experiments of mine showed trends toward smaller lar? val size, slower growth, and longer time to first reproduction for juvenile colonies that came from nutritionally stressed adults when compared to larval and juvenile controls. Lab and field experiments performed in summer 2000 tested the influence of the adult envi? ronment on the success of developing lar? vae using a factorial design with two nutri? tional treatments (high and low). In the low food treatment colonies were maintained at ambient food levels, and in the high food treatment colonies received supplemental food twice daily. After two weeks, larvae col? lected from each adult treatment were al? lowed to metamorphose and placed in high and low food environments to examine the effect of adult nutrition on a suite of post- metamorphic characters. Juvenile colonies were observed for 26 days after larval settle? ment. Results suggest that the adult envi- 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

To examine the effect of adult nutrition on survival and growth under field condi? tions, newly settled larvae from the two adult treatments were allowed to grow on settle? ment plates and were transplanted after 3 days to the laboratory docks. Juvenile colo? nies were observed for 26 days after larval settlement. In the absence of competition, results indicate that juveniles from nutrition? ally stressed adults grow just as well as ju? veniles from fed adults.

The reproductive output of female desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) may appear independent of rainfall and the springtime abundance of their preferred food, annual plants. To evaluate whether body reserves (energy, water and other nutrients) influence reproductive success and its apparent inde? pendence from such rainfall and food, three innovative, essential field methods (i.e., cy- clopropane, doubly-labeled water and ra- diographic methods) were used to measure individual energy and water budgets of wild, female desert tortoises for two reproductive cycles (years). Body energy and water re? serves, field metabolic rates, and water flux rates changed significantly amongst sea? sons and years, reflecting the females' op- portunistic and copious storage of energy and water for subsequent support of metabo? lism and egg production when food and rain- water were scarce. Through a 90% reduc? tion of metabolic rates, females conserved enough body reserves to produce eggs dur? ing extreme drought conditions, an effective bet-hedging reproductive pattern for animals inhabiting an extreme and unpredictable en? vironment. Ultrasonographic analyses on wild and captive female tortoises are reveal- ing how reproductive cycles enable, and sometimes limit, egg production. Finally, studies of reproductive nutrition are reveal- ing the importance of nitrogen, and perhaps other nutrients, to female reproductive suc- cess. New technology and field methods are furthering basic science and conserva? tion efforts. P1.68 HENRY, M., University of South Caro? lina, Columbia. Modeling body temperature of intertidal snails: hot mud and hot bodies. Intertidal snails face a cyclical ambient environmental regime due in part to the tides. However, do their body temperatures change along with the ambient environment or do they act as biological filters, not being affected by factors like the drastic tempera? ture change around them? In a preliminary study conducted in the Pacific Northwest, environmental parameters of solar radiation, ground temperature, air temperature, rela? tive humidity, and wind speed, were exam? ined to determine their effects on the body temperature of snail models (empty shells filled with modeling clay). Data on the envi? ronmental parameters were collected dur? ing two days, at approximately the same time of the tidal cycle, and used as tests of a math? ematical model of heat flux. the thermal en? ergy model included only conductoin, con? vection, IR radiation, and short-wave solar radiation terms. The mathematical model estimated body temperatures within 1.5 de? grees of actual body temperatures recorded in the field. Estimated body temperatures were within 0.5 degree of the ground tem? peratures, suggesting that the conduction term plays a large role in determining inter? nal temperature of snails in rocky intertidal habitats. The ability to predict and explain the internal body temperature of intertidal organisms can be an aid in explaining popu? lation distribution, migration patterns, and operating temperature ranges.

Crabs were treated with ESA and subsequently in? jected daily for 7 days with supernatant of crude eyestalk homogenate, the equivalent of two eyestalks per day. Crabs acclimated to 32 ppt, treated with ESA and injections, had no increase in CA activity; values were similar to control animals injected with sea water. Injection of eyestalk extract also sup? pressed CA induction in crabs treated with ESA and low salinity exposure. CA activity in the posterior gills was significantly lower than in uninjected animals. Furthermore, injection of eyestalk extract suppressed CA induction by 50% in intact crabs (no ESA treatment) exposed to low salinity. These results point to the presence of a substance in the eyestalk that functions to suppress CA expression at high salinity. Suppression is removed upon exposure to low salinity, and treatment with ESA enhances that effect. Adding back the substance through injec? tion of eyestalk extract not only reverses the effects of ESA, but it also prevents the nor? mal low salinity-mediated induction of CA in intact crabs.

When placed together in a limited space, crayfish engage in agonistic interactions that lead to formation of social dominance hier? archies. The interactions feature attacks, where one animal physically assaults an? other with its claws, approaches, where no contact occurs, retreats, where one animal walks away from another, and escapes, where rapid tail flexions and extensions thrust the animal away from the opponent. Escapes are triggered by activation of three discrete neural circuits in crayfish, two of which depend on giant command neurons. To determine how these different escape circuits were used during dominance hier? archy formation, we placed a pair of elec? trodes in the aquarium with the animals to record electric field potentials produced by the giant neurons, the motor neurons and the muscle. Activation of each tailflip circuit could be determined from differences in the field potentials that they produce. We used this non-interfering method to record activa? tion of the circuits in pairs of previously un- acquainted animals placed together in a freshwater aquarium. We found that during initial fighting, both animals performed at- tacks, approaches, and a new agonistic be? havior, offensive tailflips. This behavior is performed by one animal as it grapples an? other; the offensive tailflips thrust the animal above its opponent which is dragged about. Quite suddenly, usually after a bout of offen? sive tailflipping by one animal, the other will initiate a series of escape tailflips mediated either by the medial giant neurons or by the non-giant neurons. This is the decision point for social hierarchy formation, after which the behavior of the dominant and subordinate animals diverge.

Regulation of the hypothalamo-pitu- itary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis is coordi? nated by an elaborate neurocircuitry con? trolling activation of parvocellular neuro? secretory neurons resident in the hypo? thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Recent studies in our laboratory suggest that neurocircuits controlling HPA axis ac? tivity are stressor-specific: rapid responses to physical challenge (systemic stressors) primarily traverse brainstem circuitry, whereas responses to brain-assembled (processive) stressors involve multi-syn- aptic connections between the limbic sys? tem and PVN. Our recent work indicates that limbic control of HPA activity involves a diffuse innervation to collections of PVN- projecting cell groups in the basal fore? brain and hypothalamus, particularly in the perinuclear zone of the nucleus itself. In all, control of HPA responses to brain- built stressors appears to require commu? nication with hypothalamic regions con? trolling homeostasis, allowing the brain to be advised of ongoing physiological sta? tus prior to initiating stress responses to 800-955-1236 ?

S6.6 HERNANDEZ, LP, Wesleyan Univer? sity, Middletown, CT Functional morphology and developmental biology of zebrafish: re? ciprocal illumination from an unlikely couple. Developmental biology and functional morphology have not generally been con? sidered fields across which a useful synergy could evolve. However, recent discoveries in vertebrate morphology have been due to adoption of techniques commonly used by developmental biologists. Furthermore, re? ciprocal contributions are beginning to emerge. Functional morphology is now help? ing to explain unique patterns of morpho? genesis during early embryonic stages. As broadly defined here, developmental biol? ogy encompasses the functional aspects of early life history stages as well as molecular processes involved in embryonic pattern for? mation. I will first discuss the insights gained from research examining the biomechanics and kinematics of larval fish feeding in rela? tion to established paradigms based on adults. Functional morphologists have long examined adult feeding mechanics, but have largely ignored feeding mechanics at larval stages. Larval zebrafish were shown to have significantly different kinematic profiles from adults due to both constructional constraints and Reynolds number regime. I will then address how functional studies of larval be? havior are the basis for hypotheses that can be tested using the methodologies of the developmental biologist. Such functional data on larval performance are significant in identifying anatomical complexes that must undergo seamless embryogenesis to assure larval survival. For example, the emphasis on pronounced head lift and extreme hyoid depression during feeding in larval zebrafish has important implications for the develop? mental pathways leading to the formation of structures associated with these movements during early development.

The evolution of feeding motor patterns in lizards: modulatory complexity and con? straints. Previous research indicated that the evo? lution of feeding motor patterns across ma? jor taxonomic groups might have occurred without large modifications of the control of the jaw and hyolingual muscles. However, the proposal of this evolutionary scheme was hampered by the lack of data for some key taxa such as lizards. Recent data on jaw and hyolingual feeding motor patterns of a number of lizard families suggest extensive variability within and between species. Al? though most lizards respond to changes in the structural properties of food items by modulating the activation of the jaw and hyolingual muscles, some food specialists might have lost this ability. Whereas the over? all similarity in motor patterns across differ? ent lineages of lizards is large for the hyolingual muscles, jaw muscle activation patterns seem to be more flexible. Never- theless, all data suggest that both the jaw and hyolingual system are complexly inte? grated. The elimination of feedback path? ways from the hyolingual system through nerve transection experiments clearly shows that feedings cycles are largely shaped by feedback interactions. Yet, novel motor pat? terns including unilateral control seem to have emerged in the evolution from lizards to snakes. 64.2 HEYLAND, A.*, HODIN, J., Depart? ment of Zoology, University of Florida, Gaine, Seattle Central Community College, Seattle, WA, USA.

Studies on thyroid hormone [T3 and thy? roxine (T4)] effects on metamorphosis in amphibians have begun to elucidate how changes in thyroid hormone production and cellular responses underlie alter? ations in life history patterns. Recently, work on several echinoderm species has demonstrated that thyroxine accelerates metamorphosis in this group as well. In- terestingly, the feeding larvae of several species of sea urchins seem to obtain thy? roxine through their diet of planktonic al- 1054 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="131">gae, while non-feeding larvae of the sand dollar Peronella Japonica endogenously produce thyroxine. In order to understand the role of thyroxine production in the evo? lutionary shift from feeding (planktotrophic) to non-feeding (lecithotrophic) larval de? velopment, endogenous thyroid hormone production in feeding larva has to be in? vestigated more broadly in echinoderms. Here we examine the effects of thyroxine and a thyroxine synthesis inhibitor on the development of Dendraster excentricus, a sand dollar with a feeding larva. Thyrox? ine synthesis inhibitor treatments indicate that Dendraster excentricus larvae endog? enously produce thyroxine in addition to the exogenous thyroxine source. More? over, time to metamorphosis and juvenile size were significantly reduced in the thy? roxine treatments, which emphasizes the important role of thyroxine in the develop? ment of this species. We also report that skeleton length was reduced and vestibule invagination progressed faster in the thy? roxine treatments when compared to con? trols. Endogenous TH production might be a shared feature among sand dollars, which facilitates the evolution of lecithotrophy. Mounting evidence on the effects of thyroxine in echinoderm devel? opment suggests life history models need to incorporate the evolution of thyroxine production. 57.2 HIEBERT, S.M.*, SALVANTE, K, RAMENOFSKY, M., WINGFIELD, J.C, Swarthmore College, University of Washing? ton, University of Washington, University of Washington. Seasonal differences in the re? sponse of corticosterone and nocturnal tor? por to energy challenge in rufous humming? birds. The energy balance of captive rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) was chal? lenged during the autumn migratory sea? son and during the late winter prebasic molt by diluting the artificial nectar on which the birds feed. Body mass, cloacal fluid corti? costerone, and duration of nocturnal torpor were then compared between food dilution and normal food treatments, and between migratory and molting birds. Differences be- tween migratory and molting birds in the re? sponse patterns of all three variables to the same food dilution treatments demonstrate that corticosterone concentrations alone are not sufficient to explain the differences in torpor use in migratory and molting birds, and argue against an earlier hypothesis that corticosterone could serve as the ultimate integrator of information about physiologi? cal condition and environmental energy availability to the torpor regulation system. Additional experiments demonstrated that the sensitivity of torpor to exogenous corti? costerone during late summer differs be? tween the sexes in parallel with differences in the timing of southward migration by adult males and females. Although duration of nocturnal torpor was influenced by adminis? tration of exogenous corticosterone in sev? eral experiments, the results do not distin? guish between a direct influence of corticos? terone on torpor, and an indirect influence of corticosterone on torpor through other vari? ables such as food consumption and body mass. 37.4 HIGGINS, CL, BUTLER, P.J., STRAUSS, R.E. *, Texas Tech University, Lub? bock. Discrimination of foraging paths pro? duced by different search models. The analysis of search paths plays a key role in optimal foraging theory. We devel? oped a simplified model of resource acqui? sition in which we randomly dispersed N points ("food items") of equal value within an arena, and considered only the search path followed to find and consume the N items (assuming no satiation or learning) by computer simulation. For a given point con- figuration, two deterministic models, the glo- bally optimal shortest and longest paths, pro? vide the lower and upper bounds on path length.

Effects of turning angle on sprinting performance of three ecomorphs of arboreal lizards. Most studies on the locomotion of ani? mals are for straight, steady speed move? ments; however, many species often perform maneuvering or intermittent locomotion in their natural habitats. Lizards, including sev- eral arboreal species, have been common models for testing locomotor performance. However, no previous study has determined how maneuvering on arboreal perches may affect locomotor performance of lizards. Thus, for three sympatric species of arbo? real lizards (Anolis lineatopus, A. grahami, and A. valencienni) that are different ecomorphs with different sprinting abilities, we determined how the angle of turning af? fected locomotor performance. We used high-speed video (250 images/sec) to record the maximal running speeds of the lizards on a two-meter racetrack made of 4.8 cm diameter pipes covered with fiber- glass mesh and inclined 30/. We used race- tracks that were straight or had turn angles of 30/ or 90/ at the midpoint of the track, and we quantified the elapsed time and speeds of lizard locomotion for the middle 30-cm of the track. The total elapsed time to travel 30 cm increased significantly with in? creased turn angle for all three species, but the magnitude of the increase in elapsed time varied among species. Pauses in loco? motion became significantly more frequent and longer as turn angle increased, and the twig anole, A. valencienni, paused more than the other two species. As turn angle in? creased, turning by jumping (rather than run? ning on the perch) occurred more frequently for all species. Supported by NSF IBN 99- 83003.

A PCR-based strategy using degenerate oli- gonucleotide primers was employed to iden? tify important homeobox genes (including HOM/Hox) in marine and freshwater sponges. Several potential HOM/Hox se? quences, as well as a Pax gene and an HMG-box gene, have been identified in marine and freshwater sponge species. Us? ing RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis, we have also begun characterizing temporal 1056 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="133">expression patterns of these genes in free- swimming larvae, recently settled larvae, and young adult sponges. Furthermore, pre? liminary in situ hybridization experiments have been performed to elucidate spatial expression patterns. Porifera represent the most basal radiation of all extant phyla from the metazoan lineage, and given metazoan monophyly, it is clear that all animal body plans must have arisen from transformations of a single body plan. Sponges may hold important clues to the ancestral state(s) of many genetically controlled developmental programs in the animal kingdom. S1.1 HILL, P.S.M., University ofTulsa,OK. Vibration and animal communication: a re? view. Vibration through the substrate has likely been important to animals as a channel of communication for millions of years, but our literature on vibration in this context of bio? logically relevant information is a feature of essentially the last 30 years. Morphologists know that the jaw mechanism of early am? phibians allowed them to perceive vibration through the substrate as their large heads lay on the ground. Although the exact mecha? nism of vibration production and the precise nature of the wave produced are not always understood, recent development of afford- able instrumentation to detect and measure vibrations has allowed researchers to an? swer increasingly sophisticated questions about how animals send and receive sig? nals through this medium. We have known for some time that leafcutter ants use vibra? tion to recruit foragers, or to signal for help when buried alive, but the study of vibration in animal communication is still a relatively young field. Some of us were forced to ex? plore the use of vibration when all other at? tempts to manipulate animals in the field had failed. Others began to think about vibration to explain some of the puzzling behaviors of species they were studying in other contexts. Since then, it has become clear that the use of vibration in animal communication is much more ubiquitous than previously imagined. We now know that vibration provides infor? mation used in predator defense, prey de? tection, recruitment to food, mate choice, intrasexual competition, and matemal/brood social interactions in a variety of insect or? ders, spiders, crabs, scorpions, chameleons, frogs, golden moles, mole rats, kangaroo rats, elephants and bison. 6.3 HILTON, E.J., University of Massachu? setts Amherst. Morphological complexity and simplicity of the axial skeleton of Teleostei. Morphological complexity is a difficult and relative term, generally equated with a greater number of parts or the elaboration of a basic structural element. The vertebral skel? eton of Teleostei is among the most complex of all vertebrates, with up to thirteen discrete ossifications per body segment (more in some taxa). In this study, I examined fusion among the pre-ural vertebral elements in a broad survey of taxa. In 3lchthyodectiformes centra are spool-shaped elements from which the neural and haemal arches and parapophyses remain separate. In Elopiformes, the haemal arches and caudal neural arches are fused to the centra; the abdominal neural arches remain autog- enous and the parapophyses are only par? tially, if at all, fused to the centra. In basal Osteoglossomorpha all elements except the abdominal neural arches are fused to the centra; in more derived osteoglossomorphs the abdominal neural arches are fused to the centra. In Clupeomorpha, the anterior neural arches and parapophyses remain au- togenous. In Cypriniformes, the very ante? rior neural arches and most of the parapophyses are autogenous, although the anterior vertebral column is greatly elabo? rated in association with the Weberian ap? paratus. In more derived teleosts, each ver? tebra is fused into a single unit - in essence, simplified. With this simplification, however, there is often considerable elaboration (=complexity) of a sort not seen in more basal teleosts. For example, many groups of Percomorpha have independently evolved well-developed zygopophyses and other modifications of the vertebral elements. S10.2 HIRSCH, AM, UCLA.

Dinitrogen is fixed into ammonia by rhizobia and made available to theplant in exchange for carbon. The plant also develops root nod- ules that house the bacteria. It has been hypothesized that this symbiosis evolved from the more ancient vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Support comes from legume mutants where Nod- and Myc* co- segregate. We also found that two early nodulin (ENOD) genes, ENOD40 and ENOD2, are expressed in alfalfa VA-mycor- rhizae, supporting the idea that the signal transduction pathways between the two symbioses are conserved. Now, we have analyzed the responses of 5 classes of non- nodulating Melilotus alba (white sweetclover) mutants to both Sinorhizobium meliloti (the nitrogen-fixing symbiont) and Glomus intraradices (the mycorrhizal sym? biont) to investigate how Nod" mutations af? fect the establishment of each symbiosis and the induction of downstream genes. Of the different classes, only the Sym3 mutant is both Nod" and Myc\ In addition, we found no up-regulation of ENOD40 gene expres? sion in response to inoculation with either symbiont. Other responses downstream of the initial perception of the symbiont are also not activated compared to those of wild-type plants indicating that Sym3 is blocked in a very early stage of the interaction. More? over, there appears to be no elicitation of a defense response indicating that the host, whether wild type or mutant, recognizes the microbe as a "friend" and not as a "foe" even if the interaction is ultimately ineffectual. These data and their implications to sym? biosis overall will be discussed.

The venous system is an important effec? tor of cardiovascular homeostasis in mam? mals, whereas this vasculaturefs function in fish, remains nebulous. Fish live in a gravity- free environment and their veins appear poorly endowed with smooth muscle, there- fore it has been suggested that fish veins serve primarily as passive conduits for the return of blood to the heart. In the present study, venous function was examined in unanesthetized rainbow trout in vivo, through the construction of vascular capaci- tance curves. Vascular compliance and un- stressed blood volume can be determined from these curves and they are key indexes for describing venous function. Through the use of pharmacological probing via auto? nomic nervous system blockers in both fresh and salt water adapted fish, it appears clear that venous regulation takes place. Further? more, this active regulation of venous ca- pacitance lends evidence to support a role in cardiovascular homeostatic control by the venous vasculature, in trout. 55.5 HOAGLAND, TM*, HANCOCK, T.V, HILLMAN, S.S., University of Notre Dame, IN, University of Colorado, Boulder, Portland State University, OR. Systemic vascular com? pliance in two amphibians. The mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP), vascular compliance (VC) and un- stressed blood volume (USBV) were mea? sured in Bufo marinus and Rana catesbeiana, using in vivo methods. These values are integral for the understanding of venous function and cardiovascular homeo? stasis, and have been determined in mam? mals and fish but never in amphibians. In the present experiments, systemic arch ar? terial (PSA) and ventral abdominal venous (PVEN) pressures were measured in unanes? thetized amphibians before and during me? chanical occlusion of the conus arteriosus, while total blood volume was incrementally manipulated. Mechanical occlusion of the conus arteriosus (zero-flow condition) rap? idly (&lt;10 s) dropped PSA and increased PVEN (equals MCFP). Capacitance curves were constructed by varying total vascular volume and then measuring MCFP during zero-flow cardiac output conditions. These capacitance curves enable the extrapolation of the USBV and determination of VC.The MCFP, VC and USBV were 8.6 1 0.3 mmHg, 6.4 1 0.4 mlmmHg-1 kg1, 18.0 mlkg1 (24.3% of total vascular volume) and 9.310.3 mmHg, 3.81 0.3 mlmmHg1kg-1 and 17.2 mlkg1 (31.1% 1058 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="135">of total vascular volume) for B. marinus and R. catesbeiana, respectively. These results show that important measures of venous function are readily obtained in amphibians and the more terrestrial cane toad has a greater VC and lower USBV than the aquatic frog; these adaptations could be advanta? geous in the move to terrestriality. 50.1 HOCHBERG, R., University of New Hampshire, Durham. Function and system? atic distribution of helicoidal muscles in Gastrotricha. Studies on the muscular system of gas- trotrichs revealed the presence of muscles in a new orientation, that of left- and right- handed helices around the digestive tract. These helicoidal muscles are found on the pharynx and intestine of numerous species in both orders, Chaetonotida and Macrodasyida. In many cases, the helices surround both circular and longitudinal muscle bands. The number of helices is a function of ontogeny, and their position along the alimentary canal may be family-specific. To date, helicoidal muscles have been found in the following families: Chaetonotidae, Dactylopodolidae, Macrodasyidae, Thaumastodermatidae, Turbanellidae, and Xenotrichulidae. The precise function of these muscles remains to be determined, but we hypothesize that they play two roles: antagonize dilations of the pharynx and in? testine during feeding and contribute to shape change in the body during ciliary lo? comotion. Based on their wide systematic distribution, these muscles are likely to be part of the ground pattern of the Gastrotricha. P3.34HOCHBERG, R.*, LITVAITIS, M. K, University of New Hampshire, Durham. The nervous and muscular system of Dactylopodola baltica from a phylogenetic perspective. Attempts to infer gastrotrich phylogeny from morphological characters has re? vealed the family Dactylopodolidae to be the sister taxon to the rest of the Macrodasyida. Dactylopodola retains sev? eral plesiomorphic characteristics making the genus worthy of attention for further phylogenetic investigation. Here we report the results of research on two organ sys- terns of D. baltica, the muscular and ner? vous system. Immunofluorescent localiza? tion of acetylated tubulin and serotonin re? vealed the orientation of both main nerve cords and small sensory fibers in the spe? cies. In several cases, the nerves of D. baltica correspond in position to those of other macrodasyid taxa. Unique to D. baltica is the innervation of immunoreac? tive 5-HT neurons in the cerebral eyes? pots. In the muscular system, the arrange? ment of specific muscle sets is similar be? tween D. baltica and other macrodasyidans: inner circular muscles, left- and right- handed helicoidal muscles, longitudinal muscles, and outer circular rings.The ven? trolateral longitudinal muscles are uniquely arranged at the anterior and pos? terior portion of the body, as are their sites of insertion. It is proposed that the struc? ture and orientation of the muscles and nerves reflect both local adaptation and phylogeny, and should provide a useful source for information on gastrotrich evo? lution. 38.1 HOESE, W.J.*, MOONEY, R., NOWICKI, S., California State University, Fullerton, Duke University, Durham, NC, Duke University, Durham, NC. Neural en? coding of multiple song types in the swamp sparrow HVc. Many songbirds, including swamp spar? rows (Melospiza georgiana), sing multiple song types as adults. In Songbirds that sing only a single song type, such as zebra finches and white-crowned sparrows, neu? rons in the song nucleus HVc are song-se- lective, firing more strongly to forward than reverse playback of the bird's own song (BOS), and little or not at all to other conspe? cific songs. The manner in which a swamp sparrow's multiple song types are repre? sented by its auditory HVc neurons is un- known, but could help further our under? standing of the genesis and function of these highly selective neurons in song learning and perception. One idea is that all song types are equally effective at driving audi? tory responses in HVc neurons. A second possibility is that HVc neurons form a mo? saic, with certain cells firing preferentially in response to playback of one song or an- 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

We addressed this issue by making in vivo intracellular recordings from identified HVc neurons in urethane-anesthetized adult male swamp sparrows, using auditory playback to present the individual's different song types. We found that multiple song types were encoded in HVc in a song and cell type-specif ic manner, and that there were marked differences in subthreshold versus firing rate responses. Almost all neurons fired more strongly (and often exclusively) to a single song and, within single birds, dif? ferent neurons could prefer different songs. In contrast, inhibitory and/or excitatory sub? threshold responses could be evoked by each of the bird's song types, but these more broadly tuned subthreshold responses were still selective for forward over reverse play? back. These results suggest a local hierar? chy within HVc, where broadly selective in? puts are refined to generate highly selec? tive, song-type specific firing in certain neu? rons.

Low tem? perature tolerance of GMTtm tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. Genetically male tilapia (GMT?) are pro? duced by crossing XX female and YY male broodstock. They exhibit hybrid vigor with increased growth rates and are favored for aquaculture in warm climates. In the US tila? pia fingerlings are cultured at hatcheries and are reared at 28 to 30 C. In southern regions fingerlings can be transferred to outdoor ponds for growout in the spring. Tempera? ture tolerance dictates the duration of the valuable outdoor growing season. We ex? amined the low temperature tolerance limit by exposing GMT? fingerlings acutely to low temperatures. Fingerlings (ca. 5 g) were reared at 28 C for several weeks and ex? posed (n = 90) to reduced temperatures for 24 hr and then placed back into 28 C water for 72 hr. Survivorship was recorded after the initial exposure (24 hr) and at 24, 48, and 72 hr post-exposure. Greater than 98% of the fingerlings survived the initial expo? sure to 20 C and 18 C and the subsequent recovery period. Fish exposed to 16 C ex? hibited a 97% survival rate after the initial exposure and a 90% survival rate after the 24 hr recovery period. Fish exposed to 14 C exhibited an 88% survival rate after the ini? tial exposure and a 76% survival rate after the 24 hr recovery period. No fish survived exposure to 12 C. The significant difference in survivorship between the fish exposed to 14 C and 12 C suggests an LT50 of approxi? mately 13 C.To maximize production we sug? gest that fingerlings be transferred to ponds with temperatures no lower than 18 C prior to the summer growing season.

The prairie mole cricket (Gryllotalpa ma? jor) is a burrowing insect native to the tallgrass prairies of the southern United States. The male produces a loud, long- range calling song at sunset in April and May by rubbing the plectrum of one wing along the file of the other wing. The sound produced is a series of chirps. The wing morphology of G. major was compared with five other mole cricket species found in North America: N hexadactyla, G. gryllotalpa, S. abbreviatus, S. vicinus, S. borellii. The over? all wing structures among the crickets were similar, yet calling songs differ in that G. ma? jor and N. hexadactyla chirp while the oth? ers trill. S. abbreviatus does not have a call? ing song. The type of calling song may re? flect an adaptation that promotes being heard in a particular habitat and may influence the type of mating system of a species. In addi? tion, DNA sequence data were compared for the same species. A morphological phy? logeny and a molecular phylogeny for the Gryllotalpidae were constructed to deter? mine if the different species express a simi? lar trait because they inherited it from a com? mon ancestor or because they acquired it independently. The phylogenies account for the history of character change and allow for hypotheses to be developed regarding the course of the mole crickets' evolution and the correlation of this with behavior traits. 1060 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

Mandibular symphyseal fusion in mammals: a test of competing hypotheses. The mammalian lineage is replete with instances of convergent acquisition of man? dibular symphyseal fusion. While a variety of models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, three are currently de- bated in the literature. Two of these, the dor? soventral (DV) shear and wishboning mod? els, suggest that fusion functions to strengthen the symphysis against DV shear of the sym- physis and lateral transverse bending of the mandible, respectively. A third model, re? ferred to here as the transverse stiffness model, argues that fusion serves to stiffen the symphysis to facilitate transverse oc- clusal movements. ANCOVA and a nonpara? metric ANOVA were used to test mandibular scaling and occlusal orientation predictions from each of these models in a sample of 44 species of selenodont artiodactyls. Consis? tent with the wishboning and transverse stiff? ness models, taxa with fused symphyses (camelids) have more horizontally oriented M2 and M2 occlusal wear facets and ex? panded corpus and symphysis dimensions in the horizontal plane (p&lt;0.05). Contrary to the DV shear model, camelids do not have relatively deeper corpora to resist greater parasagittal bending of the balancing-side corpus. While taxa with ossified symphyses have relatively larger symphysis cross-sec? tional areas (consistent with the DV shear model), this appears to be the byproduct of an increase in AP symphysis length which serves to counter increased lateral trans? verse bending of the mandible. A consider? ation of the biomechanics of mastication fur? ther suggests that strength, not stiffness, is the critical factor necessitating symphyseal ossification. These results provide additional evidence that fusion and transverse masti- catory loads are functionally linked, further securing the role of wishboning as the pri? mary determinant of symphyseal fusion in mammals.

An endocrine basis of different migratory strat? egies in long- and short-distance neotropical migrants. Migratory birds show great variation in behavioral and physiological strategies for reaching their destinations. We are com? paring behavior and physiology in two spe? cies of Neotropical migrants, the long-dis- tance migrant, the Blackpoll warbler (Dendroica striata) and the short-distance migrant, the Yellow-rumped warbler (D. coronata) in the field and laboratory. During the post-breeding preparation for autumn migration at Churchill, Manitoba, where both species must initially undergo an overland migration, there was no difference between the two species in fat reserves, energetic condition or patterns of corticosterone se? cretion and triglyceride levels. However, at coastal Maine, where Yellow-rumps continue to move further south over land and Black- polls prepare for a 4-5 day, non-stop trans- oceanic flight to South America (often dou- bling their lean body mass to do so), Black- polls had higher baseline corticosterone and triglyceride levels than they expressed at Churchill, while Yellow-rumps did not. In the laboratory, as expected, Blackpolls retained greater fat reserves and higher baseline cor? ticosterone and triglyceride levels later into the autumnal migratory period than Yellow rumps. There was no correlation between baseline corticosterone and triglyceride lev? els in either species in the field or in the labo? ratory, suggesting that while elevated corti? costerone is often associated with migratory fattening and, in some studies, found to be necessary for it to occur, its exact role in fa- cilitating the availability or production of lipid substrates is unclear. 57.3 HOLBERTON, R.*, WILSON, CM, SIMS, C, CASH, W.B., University of Maine, University of Mississippi, University of Mis? sissippi, Maryville College.

Ten days after injections began, MD and HD corticosterone levels were simi? lar to each other and significantly lower than those in C and LD (which were elevated above pre migratory levels). C and LD birds began to fatten and gain body mass soon after transfer to long days. Three weeks af? ter treatments ended there was no difference in corticosterone or body mass between the four groups. However, MD and HD birds were significantly delayed in the onset of fattening; MD birds increased mass imme- diately after injections ceased and HD birds began to fatten 5-7 days later. Differences in patterns of mass gain could not be explained by food intake as all groups showed the same pattern of increased food intake. These re? sults suggest that an increase in baseline corticosterone is needed to facilitate normal spring migratory fattening but, while corti? costerone may increase food intake during the non-migratory period in a Istress? or istress avoidance? response, it is dissociated from the hyperphagia that occurs as a nor? mal component of migratory condition.

Xylem vessels are well known for their passive role in water transport and the pos? sibility that these tubes comprised of dead cells might possess the ability for rapid flow control has never been considered. The pre? vailing view among plant biologists is that xylem conduits have two hydraulic states; they either transport water with a constant resistance or are blocked due to embolism. The suggestion that plants can refill embolized vessels, even when there is ten? sion in adjacent conduits, may contribute to the dynamic stability of water transport ca? pacity in plants. We discuss our empirical and modeling efforts to understand this re? pair phenomenon, focusing on the appar? ent contradictionbetween bubble dissolution and xylem tension. We then discuss our re? cent finding that xylem hydraulic resistance is a function of xylem sap ion concentration. We provide data demonstrating that the ef? fect of ions on flow resistance results from the action of a hydrogel located in the pit membranes. We hypothesize that the effect of ions on xylem hydraulic resistance repre? sents an important component in the regu? lation of water flow through plants. By pro? viding a mechanism by which plants can alter the relative flow resistance through portions of their xylem, ion-dependent hydraulic re? sistance may allow plants to control the rela? tive flows of water in a manner appropriate for a highly branched system. 70.4 HOLFORD, KC*, BORST, D.W., Purdue University North Central, Westville, IN, Illinois State University, Normal, IL. The effects of sinus gland extracts on transcript levels of farnesoic acid O-methyl transferase (MeT) in the lobster mandibular organ. Methyl farnesoate (MF) appears to have important roles in the regulation of crusta? cean reproduction, molting, and behavior. In decapod crustaceans, the mandibular or? gan (MO) is the principle site of MF synthe? sis and is inhibited by a peptide from the sinus gland (SG, a neuroendocrine tissue in the eyestalk). This MO-inhibiting hormone (MO-IH) lowers MF synthesis in part by re? ducing the activity of MeT (the final enzy? matic step in MF production). We investi? gated the mechanisms of this inhibition by treating eyestalk-ablated lobsters (Homarus americanus) with a SG extract (0.2 SG equivalents) in saline-0.1% BSA or with sa- line-BSA alone (control). Hemolymph samples were taken for MF analysis before and 3 hours after treatment. MO&amp;'s were then removed and used to determine MeT activity and MeT transcript levels. SG treat? ment caused a 68% decrease in hemolymph levels of MF. Control animals showed no change in MF levels. Likewise, MeT activity of MOs from SG treated animals was 85% less (P &lt; 0.001) than that measured in MOs from control animals. However, MeT tran? script levels in these two groups were not 1062 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="139">significantly different (P&gt;0.11). These data indicate that the decrease in MeT activity caused by MO-IH is not mediated by a de? crease in MeT gene expression. Rather, SG extract appears to act either by inhibiting the translation of MeT mRNA or through the post- translational modification of MeT.

Characterization and distri? bution of [3H]muscimol binding to a GABA- a-like receptor in the bullfrog brain. The inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA) has multiple re? ceptor subtypes. The GABAA receptor is widespread in the mammalian brain, but little is known about GABA receptors in the am? phibian brain. Binding of the GABAA recep? tor agonist, [3H]muscimol, to membrane preparations from the brain of the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, was investigated in ki? netic and competition experiments. Binding of 20nM [3H]muscimol to membranes was specific and could be displaced by 10uM GABA. Association binding curves showed that equilibrium occurred rapidly, within 10 minutes, and 76% dissociation occurred within 10 minutes as well. Binding of [3H]muscimol could be inhibited by GABA (IC50 around 100nM) and by the GABAA re? ceptor antagonist, bicuculline (IC50 around 10uM). In situ autoradiography with PH]muscimol showed putative GABAA recep? tors broadly distributed in the bullfrog brain. Specific binding of [3H]muscimol was espe? cially dense in the olfactory bulb, striatum, and hypothalamus. In the mammalian brain, muscimol is specific for the GABAA subtype of receptor. The affinity of the bullfrog bind? ing sites for muscimol, GABA, and bicuculline supports the hypothesis that the bullfrog brain contains a GABAA receptor- like protein.

We examined arginine kinase (AK) flux as a function of intracellular osmogregulatory state in locomotor muscle from blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) saturation trans? fer experiments were applied to measure AK flux ex vivo in isolated, superfused swim? ming leg muscle. Blue crabs were pre-ex- posed for 7 days to either 5, 17 or 34 ppt salinity prior to experiments. AK flux was then measured using a superf usion medium that had an osmolarity equivalent to that which occurs in blue crabs in vivo at one of the three salinities above (e.g., 5 ppt exter? nal salinity = 640 mosM blood). Therefore, we could mimic the osmolarity of the extra? cellular environment surrounding the muscle cells under physiologically relevant condi? tions of osmoregulation. AK flux was then measured under condtions of steady-state (superfusion medium = acclimated blood os? molarity), hyperosmotic shock and hyposmotic shock. To further elucidate the role of changes in the intracellular environ? ment on AK function, we also measured AK flux in vitro. Here, we used saturation trans? fer of isolated AK in solutions comprising different levels of salts and organic osmolytes. Proton NMR was used to help identify the concentrations of the relevant organic osmolytes. P3.38HOOD, CS.*, ASKAR, M., Loyola University, New Orleans, LA.

The ratio of male/female SSD for centroid size was 1.0377, which was statistically sig? nificant (ANOVA, F = 4.81, P &lt; 0.05).

Non-muscle actin in scle- rotic components of the female reproductive system of acoel turbellarians. The seminal bursa of many acoel tur? bellarians is associated with an insemi- nation canal, called a mouthpiece or nozzle, that appears sclerotized?that is, stiff and refractile by light microscopy. The mouthpiece is composed of stacks of ring- shaped cells and the stiffening element is intracellular actin, as can be seen by fluo? rescence microscopy of phalloidin-stained whole mounts. The function of the mouth? piece has long been assumed to be sort- ing of sperm stored in the bursa for deliv? ery to mature oocytes situated at the distal end of the mouthpiece. In species of Pseudmecynostomum (Acoelomorpha Mecynostomidae), a similar actin-rich structure is situated at the functionally op? posite end of the bursa, that is between it and the vagina, which is surprisingly com? plex in this genus. It has been identified as a vaginal sphincter in descriptions of Pseudmecynostomum species, but we find, using electron microscopy, that it is not muscular and consists, as do bursa mouthpieces, of stacks of ring-shaped ac? tin-rich cells. We propose that the bursa mouthpiece has assumed a new function in Pseudmecynostomum, perhaps by de? velopment of a secondary female pore near the distal end of the mouthpiece from an ancestor lacking the female pore. 56.3 HOOPFER, E.D, DENVER, R.J. *, Uni? versity of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Synergistic upregulation of thyroid hormone receptor mRNAs by thyroid hormone and corticos? terone in tadpoles of Xenopus laevis. Corticosteroids (CS) potentiate thyroid hormone (T3)-induced metamorphosis in several amphibian species. We tested the hypothesis that corticosterone (B) induces T3 receptor (TR) expression and that this ef? fect is at the level of transcription. Tail ex- plant cultures were initiated from St. 54 Xe? nopus tadpoles and treated for 7 days with or without T3 at 10 or 100 nM, B at 100, 500 or 3400 nM, or 10 nM T3 plus B at 100, 500 or 3400 nM. Tails were imaged daily, areas calculated and dry weights determined at the end of the experiment. Separate groups of similarly treated tails were harvested at 2 and 5 days after the initiation of hormone treatments and total RNA extracted for North? ern blot analysis. T3 at 100 nM caused sig? nificant tail regression but 10 nM T3 alone did not. B alone caused a dose-dependent increase in final tail dry weight. All doses of B synergized with 10 nM T3 to cause tail re? gression comparable to the 100 nM T3 dose. At the two time points T3 alone caused a dose- dependent increase in TR-ALPHA and TR- BETA mRNAs. Interestingly, B alone also caused a dose-dependent increase in both TR mRNAs. T3 at 10 nM plus B produced a synergistic effect comparable to the level of gene induction caused by 100 nM T3. T3 caused a dose-dependent upregulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA but B had no effect. Xenopus TR-BETA promoter activity was upregulated by 100 nM B in transfected XTC-2 cells, suggesting a direct transcriptional action of the GR on TR-BETA expression.These results support the hypoth? esis that B synergizes with T3 to promote tail regression by upregulating TRs, most likely at the level of TR transcription.

Androgen levels in breeding Utah tiger salamanders. Many recent papers have investigated the relationship between plasma levels of testosterone (T) and male behavior during the breeding season. One question of inter? est is whether male reproductive behavior is associated or dissociated with maximal levels of circulating T Data concerning pat? terns of association are scarce for amphib? ians, particularly for salamanders studied in the field. We measured sex steroid levels (T, DHT, E) for 6 adult male tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum) collected during their spring breeding season from ponds in the Wasatch Mountains near Ogden, UT (elev. 8000 n 8500 ft.) Blood samples were taken within 5 minutes of cap? ture. Mean hormone values (range) were: T = 2.25 (0.3 - 6.22) ng/ml, DHT = 481 (114- 1785) pg/ml, and E = 17 (7 - 28) pg/ml. These values are comparable to plasma levels measured for spring-breeding Colorado A. tigrinum that are neotenic (aquatic adults breed despite retaining larval morphology.) The dissociated pattern described for these two A. triginum populations is in contrast with maximal T and DHT levels recorded for a fall breeding congener, A. opacum. These data suggest that elevated levels of plasma an? drogens are not required for concurrent breeding behavior in spring-breeding ambystomatid salamanders. 68.6 HOUSEMAN, J.

This paper reports on seven years of per? sonal experience on using digital media and new technologies for teaching Introductory Zoology, and looks back on some of the things that worked along with some that didn't. University of Ottawa is Canada's larg? est bilingual institution and teaching materi? als for our francophone students are non- existent. As a result, our initial, and naive objective for using new technologies was to create the required materials in both lan- guages. Complications, not the least of which was copyright, required that we create new materials and these are available in the media bank BIODIDAC that currently con? tains over 4,000 items optimized for digital, rather than print use (a http:// biodidac.bio.uottawa.ca"). Media from BIODIDAC is used in lectures as PowerPoint slides, a variety of web based self evalua? tion tools, and a multimedia application de? signed to enhance understanding of classi? fication and biology of the various speci? mens that students encounter in the lab. Col- lectively referred to as Digital Zoology (? McGraw-Hill Higher Education, http:// www.mmhe.com/zoology), the material is not intended to replace lab specimens, dissec? tion, nor traditional instruction. Instead, Digi? tal Zoology gives students an opportunity to see the dissected version of a specimen be? fore the lab and a tool for review, reference and exam preparation. For teachers, it pro? vides the resources required to effectively use new technologies in either lectures or labs and at their own pace. Strategies for incorporating new technologies into teach? ing, student reactions to Digital Zoology, and some of the tricks and traps that were en- countered along the way will be discussed. 13.6 HOWDESHELL, KL *, RUHLEN, R.L, WELSHONS, W.V., VOM SAAL, FS, Univer? sity of Missouri, Columbia. Serum regula? tion of estrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals during mouse neonatal develop? ment. Certain chemicals used in plastics and other products are capable of disrupting development by mimicking the action of the sex hormone estradiol, and thus are referred to as estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemi? cals (EEDCs). While traditional risk assess? ment for EEDCs has focused on high dose effects, low-dose in utero exposure to EEDCs can alter postnatal reproductive function and physiology. In adult human serum, EEDCs 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

We hypothesized that EEDCs will also ex? hibit low affinity for serum regulatory pro? teins during development, thus resulting in a higher bioactive fraction of EEDCs and result in different levels of estrogen-respon- siveness dependent on dose. Neonatal mice were exposed to a range of doses of E2 and the EEDC diethylstilbestrol (DES) by cap? sule implant on postnatal day 1-5. The ac? tual dose released from the capsules was characterized using tritium-labeled labeled E2 and DES. Neonatal response varied as a function of dose; uterine weight was sig? nificantly heavier (P&lt;0.001) than controls with low dose DES exposure (0.32 ng/24 hr), while a higher dose of DES (239.17 ng/ 24 hr) depressed the response relative to the low DES dose. Similar results were found with 10-fold higher E2 exposure; uterine weight was increased (P&lt;0.001) above con? trols at low dose of 4.68 ng/24 hr. Ongoing research will be presented regarding the bioactive versus total dose of DES and E2 delivered to serum and their affinity for se? rum binding proteins as well as data from similar investigations with the EEDC, bisphenol A. 27.4 HOYT, D.F*, WICKLER, S.J., COGGER, E.A., GOEHRING, M.E, Califor? nia State Polytechnic University, Pomona, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona California State Polytechnic Univer? sity, Pomona, Colby College, Waterville, ME. A reexamination of the trot-gallop transition: insights from the study of locomotion on an incline. Previous workers concluded that forces trigger the trot-gallop (T-G) transition be? cause it occurred at a lower speed when ponies carried a load and, at the T-G speed, the metabolic rate was higher galloping than trotting. We determined how incline (which does not increase force) affects the T-G tran? sition speed in 6 horses (mean mass 460 kg) trained for at least 6 months to run on a treadmill on the level and up a 10% incline. First, transition speeds (the lowest speed at which the horse would gallop continuously for one minute) were determined by chang? ing speed in increments of 0.25 m/s. Subse- quently, the horses were trained to change gait on command over a range of speeds from 1.0 m/s below T-G speed to 0.5 m/s above. Metabolic rate was measured using open-flow respirometry. Duty factor (DF) was determined using accelerometers taped to the horses' hooves. Accelerometer signals were validated with high-speed (125 hz) video. For trotting, data from a diagonal pair of legs were averaged and for galloping data from all four legs were averaged. Statistics reported are for paired t-tests. On an inciine, the T-G speed is 0.75 m/s slower (p&lt;0.001), suggesting that force is not the trigger. At the highest trotting speed, DF on the inciine is 6% higher (p=0.018) than on the level, sug? gesting that peak ground reaction forces may be lower on the inciine and there may not be a consistent threshold. At the T-G speed on the level, metabolic rate is 7% lower (p=0.009) galloping than trotting and at the T-G speed on the inciine (5.08 m/s) there is no difference in metabolic rate (p=0.09), in? dicating metabolism may be the trigger. Un? der both conditions DF at the T-G speed is lower when galloping than trotting. 21.2 HSIEH, ST, Harvard University. On? togenetic 3-D kinematics of water running in green basilisk lizards (Basiliscus plumifrons). Most research on tetrapod locomotion has focused on movement over solid sub? strates. The question of how animals locomote on fluid substrates is just begin? ning to be explored. Basilisk lizards are known for their ability to run across the sur? face of water to evade predators. Previous research indicates that this method of es? cape depends largely on how much force the animal generates when slapping the water, relative to its body mass. I ran eight green basilisk lizards (Basiliscus plumifrons) across a 3.7 m long water track. Animals ranged in size and age from two week-old hatchlings to year-old juveniles (2-60g). Runs were filmed with two high-speed Redlake video cameras operating at 250fps and 1/2500 shutter speed. Digitized coordi- nates from each camera were transformed 1066 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="143">into three dimensions using direct linear transformation. I divided each stride into four phases: slap, stroke, upwards recovery, and downwards recovery. In comparison to a stride on land, the slap and stroke phases are analogous to periods when the foot is in contact with the ground, while the recovery phases are analogous to when the foot is not in contact with the ground. Preliminary results suggest that there is extreme varia? tion in the kinematics of running, both within and between individuals. Within one run, ve? locity may vary by as much as 18% (87.9 to 107.2 cm/s); and the slap may occur with the toe first contacting the water (toe strike), or the whole foot contacting the water (flat-foot strike). Equally large variations could be ob? served in 3D angular motions of the hip, knee, and ankle joints. However, while con? tact time (tc, slap and stroke phases com? bined) may last between 0.040s and 0.064s, duty factor (tc/stride period) appears to be relatively invariant (0.458?0.013, mean ? se).

Insulin- like growth factor (IGF) binding protein-5 stimulates cell motility through an IGF-inde- pendent mechanism that may involve in its nuclear translocation. Porcine vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) secrete insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5). In this report, we show that IGFBP-5 regulates VSMC mo? tility through an IGF-dependent as well as an IGF-l-independent mechanism. The mi- gration-promoting effects of IGFBP-5 and/or IGF-I were analyzed by a trans-well migra? tion assay (directed migration) and a gold particle cell motility assay (random motility). IGF-I is a strong regulator of directed migra? tion in VSMCs. When incubated with IGF-I at equal molar concentration, IGFBP-5 caused a 3.6-fold increase in directed migration to? wards IGF-I. IGFBP-5 alone caused a sig? nificant increase in basal migration and ran? dom motility. While addition of an IGF neu- tralizing antibody abolished the chemotac- tic effect of IGF-I, it did not affect the IGFBP- 5-induced changes, indicating such change is not due to the interaction between IGFBP- 5 and endogenous IGF-I. To investigate the IGF-l-independent mechanism(s) that IGFBP-5 utilizes to alter VSMC motility, the nuclear localization of IGFBP-5 was exam? ined by immunocytochemistry. IGFBP-5 was easily detectable in the nuclei of cultured VSMCs. When added to cultured VSMCs, Cy3-tagged IGFBP-5 was translocated into nuclei. In addition to a 1.7 fold increase in IGF-l-induced migration, targeted express- ing of IGFBP-5 in VSMC nuclei resulted in a 6-fold increase in the basal migration and motility in the absence of IGF-I. These find? ings suggest that IGFBP-5 plays an impor? tant role in regulating VSMC motility through a ligand-independent mechanism that may involve in nuclear translocation of this unique IGFBP (Supported by NIH R01HL60679 and NSF Grant 978911).

The essential role of thyroid hormone (T3) in amphibian metamorphosis has been un? derstood for some time. However, the mecha? nisms by which it causes pleiotropic effects remain unknown. Our group seeks to char- acterize the molecular action of thyroid hor? mone in the larval brain. In this study, we investigated the effects of thyroid hormone on cell proliferation, migration and differen? tiation during metamorphosis of the Xeno? pus tadpole. For cell proliferation studies, premetamorphic tadpoles were treated with 500 nM Bromo deoxyuridine (Brdu) with or without 50 nM T3 for 24,48,72 and 96 hours. Samples were then processed for Brdu immuno-histochemistry (IHC) or in situ hy? bridization for the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) ALPHA and BETA isoforms. Our pre? liminary IHC and in situ analyses demon? strate thatT3 dramatically increases cell birth within the periventricular zone and that both TR-ALPHA and TR-BETA messages are el? evated in this region. We are currently at? tempting to colocalize these signals with Brdu immunoreactivity. In our migration stud? ies, animals were pulsed in 500 nM Brdu, cleared for 24 hours and then treated with or without 50 nM T3 for 24, 48, 72 or 96 hours. 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Few students, teachers or members of the general public participate directly in cut- ting-edge research and therefore fail to de? velop a full understanding of scientific is? sues. A community of teachers and re? searchers, supported by the National Sci? ence Foundation, have created the Teach? ers Experiencing Antarctica and the Arctic Program to expand the impact of polar re? search. In March and April 2000,1 assisted researchers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (J. McClintock, C. Amsler, K. Iken) and the Florida Institute of Technology (B. Baker) with their research at Palmer Sta- tion on the Antarctic Peninsula. We investi? gated the ecological roles of bioactive com? pounds in marine macroalgae and benthic invertebrates. During this time students, teachers and other interested parties shared our research experience through electronic communication.Topics included SCUBA div? ing, sample collection, laboratory experi- mentation and chemical analysis. The teacher participation in field research pro? vided a rich basis for public education and development of resources and materials. Through casual observation, children and adults taking part in these research-related activities, workshops and presentations ap? pear to be more likely to follow upon their curiosity, show a greater intrest in science topics, better understand the research pro? cess and gain a greater awareness of the relevance of science. S5.8 HUEY, R.B., University of Washington, Seattle. Behavior as a buffer of environmen? tal change. A common view is that animals and plants differ fundamentally in the way they interact with the physical environment. For example, animals are generally much more mobile than plants and thus are better able to use behavior to ameliorate environmen? tal change. If this is the case, then plants might be more likely to respond to environ? mental change via evolutionary shifts in physiological sensitivity rather than by be? havioral shifts. I review how behavior can function as a buffer of environmental change, and then address whether behavioral op- tions do in fact differ between plants and animals. I use examples drawn from the lit? erature of ectotherm thermoregulation. 28.3 HULSEY, C.D*, WAINWRIGHT, RC, GRUBICH, J.R., University of California, Davis, University of California, Davis, Florida State University Theoretical and empirical diversity of anterior jaw functional feeding morphology. Using both computer simulations and morphometrics of 81 species of labrid fishes, we explored morphospace occupation and functional consequences of design in the anterior jaws four bar linkage. This linkage model abstracts the mechanical properties of the feeding apparatus and is composed of four physical links: the lower jaw, the max- illa, the nasal, and the suspensorium. If one angle between any two of the links and a change in that angle are designated, an in? dex of how motion is transmitted through the linkage, KT, can be calculated. Higher KTs represent increased angular rotation of the maxilla per unit angular change of the lower jaw. By changing single links in a hypotheti? cal morphospace, we found increases in the relative length of the lower jaw or nasal in? creased KT. Alternatively, increases in the maxilla or suspensorium generally de? creased KT. We also modified starting angle and input angle to determine how the con- figuration of linkages influenced KT. Differ? ences in starting angle, the initial angle be? tween the suspensorium and lower jaw, gen? erally had a large effect on KT. However, changing input angle, the angular rotation of the lower jaw, had little effect on KT. The empirically measured linkages suggest labrid anterior jaws have diversified, with a 1068 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="145">few notable exceptions, into all mechanically feasible morphologies with KTs between 0.3 to 1.2. We also analyzed the correlation be? tween KT and the principal components (PCA) of all the labrid linkages. We found KT was correlated with PC2 and PC3 but uncorrelated with PC1, interpreted as size. These correlations suggest that the skeletal structure in labrids that transfers motion from the lower jaw to the maxilla has diversified along at least two independent shape axes. We discuss the relevance of this to the di? versity of species and feeding modes within labrids. P2.39HUMFELD, S.C., University of Mis- souri-Columbia. Satellite male green treefrogs are competitively inferior. Individuals of different competitive abili? ties or in certain environmental circum? stances adopt different alternative mating tactics as a conditional strategy. Male green treefrogs (Hyla cinerea) primarily produce acoustic signals to attract females; however, satellite males do not produce advertisement calls and attempt to intercept and mate with females attracted to another calling male. Satellite males are not incapable of calling; they may switch tactics within and between nights. In an observational field study, I re? corded advertisement calls and body mea? surements of males adopting calling and satellite mating tactics as a preliminary in? vestigation of the intrinsic and extrinsic fac? tors that lead males to adopt alternative mating tactics. Satellite males were signifi? cantly smaller, less weighty and in poorer condition than calling males (P &lt; 0.04). Re? peated measures analysis of frogs observed using both tactics indicates the existence of size-independent mating tactic choice based on condition; seven of eight males observed using both tactics were in poorer condition as satellites (P &lt; 0.03). Satellite males pro? duced higher frequency advertisement calls than callers (P &lt; 0.02), which are less attrac- tive to females choosing mates. When the effects of mass on frequency are statistically removed, satellite males still produce higher frequency calls. A significant negative cor? relation (r = -0.30, P &lt; 0.05) between condi? tion and call frequency within the popula? tion suggests that poor condition may con- strain males to produce unattractive, high- frequency advertisement calls. I conclude that males adopting the satellite mating tac- tic are at a competitive disadvantage for ob? taining mates using the calling tactic and may maximize their opportunities for mating by parasitizing males more likely to attract females. 55.2 HUNTVONHERBING,l.*,CASHON, B., University of Maine, Orono, ME. Sickling in fish red blood cells. The occurrence of the mutant hemoglo? bin Hb S in human red blood cells results in sickle cell anemia. In other animals,oxygen-linked sickling of red blood cells is largely unknown.In Atlantic cod red blood cells under oxygenated conditions cell morphology appears nor? mal, but under low-oxygen conditions he? moglobin crystallizes resulting in sickled cells. To determine the oxygen linkage of this sickling phenomenon we inserted whole red blood cells of a freshly killed juvenile cod into a 1 mm thick glass cu- vette and monitored changes in the mor? phology of the cells and formation of crys? tals using a compound microscope.lmages were relayed through a high-resolution color video camera to a computer and cap? tured using the OPTIMAS image analysis system. Simultaneously with the change of cell morphology we were able to moni- tor the spectral shift from oxy to de-oxy he? moglobin. We found that although 99% of the red blood cells contained hemoglobin crystals and were sickled, the shape of the red blood cells were not drastically altered. As a result, although oxygen transport may be modulated by the formation of crystals, transport within the vascular system may not be impeded under conditions of hy? poxia. This differs from human sickle cells in which red cell morphology is radically distorted leading to occlusions within the vascular system which cause immense pain to the patient. Exposure to carbon monoxide reversed the sickling morphol? ogy. Sickling therefore appears to be ligand linked which is analogous to human sickle cell hemoglobin.

However, sickling may be temperature dependent and be an adaptation to specific thermal regimes. Benefits of the sickling trait for survival and the reasons for its evolution in fishes is still unclear and is currently under investi? gation. S1A0 HUNT, R.E., Indiana University South- east. Mating behavior in leafhoppers and treehoppers: involvement of vibrational sig? nals in male-male competition and female preference. The evolution of communication systems is strongly influenced by the types of signals used by animals and the environment though which they are transmitted. For ex? ample, acoustic signals are transmitted rap? idly over great distances and the environ? ment influences signal fidelity in predictable ways. Thus, sexual selection acting on sig? nals and receiver mechanisms is possible and has resulted in competitive interactions among males and female preference in many insect and vertebrate taxa. In con? trast, sexual selection is generally thought to be unlikely in organisms that use vibra? tional signals on plants because of their short range. I review recent studies of the leaf- hopper Graminella nigrifrons that show that sexual competition among males involves vibrational signals. Analyses of field and laboratory recordings reveal that males al? ternate calls (i.e. chorus) and playback ex? periments reveal simple rules that regulate chorus structure. It is further shown that avoid- ing call overlap is adaptive in that it in? creases a male's mating success when in? volved in a scramble competition for access to a responding female. I also summarize ongoing studies of the treehopper Enchenopa binotata which suggest that fe? males diseriminate among males based on characteristics of their vibrational signals. 60.1 HURTT, B.C*, BEKOFF, A.C Univer? sity of Colorado at Boulder. Modulation of the walking motor pattern in chicks due to asymmetric loading of the flexor muscles. Rhythmic motor patterns, such as walk? ing, can be characterized by various com? ponents of the movement cycle using a vari- ety of techniques, including kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) analyses. Normal, unloaded walking motor patterns are asym? metric: extension duration is longer than flex? ion, and extensors are active for a greater percentage of the cycle period than flexors. One significant question of interest concerns the role sensory input plays in establishing and modulating various rhythmic motor pat? terns such as walking. Specifically, we were interested in examining the changes in walk? ing motor output in chicks following loading, and subsequent unloading, of the legs with weights. Eight day old chicks walked under three conditions: without weights for 10 min? utes (PRE), with small, 8 gram leg weights placed below each ankle for 10 minutes (WTS), and after removal of the weights for 10 minutes (POST). Kinematic markers were placed at five points and digitized to deter? mine joint movement at the three major leg joints: hip, knee and ankle. EMG analysis was conducted by implanting electrodes in antagonistic muscles at each of the three major leg joints. The WTS condition resulted in an increase in extension (stance) as well as alterations in the characteristics of stance, while flexion decreased. In response to the increased load, both extensor and flexor activity increased in duration, resulting in an overlap of antagonist bursts. The POST condition did not show a complete recovery to the normal walking, or PRE, level by ei? ther kinematic or EMG measures. Rather, it indicated a progressive but incomplete re? covery of normal walking at 10 minutes. In all three conditions, extension remained highly correlated with cycle period. However, flexion and flexor activity became more highly correlated with cycle period during WTS and POST. 41.2 HUSKEY, S.H.*, TURINGAN, R.G., Florida Institute of Technology.

Percent volumetric contributions of four functional prey categories (plankton, insect, crustacean, and fish) were compared among fish-size classes to determine if stage-spe? cific differences in prey consumption existed between populations. Subtropical M. salmoides shifted from feeding on plankton and macroinvertebrates to piscivory by 20mm standard length (SL); and stopped consuming plankton by 29mm SL. Temper? ate largemouth bass did not become piscivores until 37mm SL and continued uti? lizing plankton up to 69mm SL. Following the onset of piscivory, 100-260mm SL sub? tropical bass began utilizing more crusta? ceans than fish. In contrast, temperate M. salmoides consistently fed on fish following the onset of piscivory. Variations in food hab? its were associated with differences in gape size between temperate and subtropical populations. Temperate largemouth bass had significantly larger gape height and width than subtropical bass. Although piscivory is a well-known feature of M. salmoides, the ontogeny of piscivory may vary between locations. We hypothesize that intraspecific differences in jaw gape may be related to variations in prey-resource utili? zation. 31.3 HUTCHINSON, J.R, Univ Calif. 2-D quasi-static simulations of stance and gait in Tyrannosaurs and other tetrapods. Could the hindlimb muscles of a mas? sive biped such as Tyrannosaurus support the stresses of running? I report preliminary results from biomechanical computer simu? lations of the net muscle moments required to maintain static equilibrium during bipedal standing (with extrapolations to mid-stance of walking and running) in Alligator, Gallus, Homo, Tyrannosaurus, and other tetrapods. Using data such as body segment dimen? sions, joint angles, and muscle architecture, I model how much volume of hindlimb muscle must be active to balance the mo? ment of the ground reaction force at each joint. The models predict that the net muscle moments that the hindlimb muscles of Alli- gator can generate could not support bipe? dal running, whereas Gallus and Homo re? quire a fairly low volume of active hindlimb muscle even to run. Thus my simulations compare favorably with data from living sub? jects. My models of Tyrannosauru&amp;n vari? ous stances estimate that a huge volume of active hindlimb muscles would be required for running. In preliminary analyses, roughly 20-30% of the body mass would need to be hindlimb joint extensors. The knee joint moment is especially sensitive to the stance that is input. Was there sufficient hindlimb muscle volume to allow running in Tyranno? saurus! I demonstrate what assumptions must be made to conclude either that Tyran? nosaurus lacked sufficient muscle volume for running, or that it did have sufficient mus? culature. This shows how sensitivity analy? sis of unknown variables is vital for quantita- tively bounding the range of possible loco? motor performance in extinct organisms and for minimizing speculation.

Utilising commercially-available three-dimensional scans of the human skeleton and range of motion data compiled from the scientific lit? erature, a model ofthe human musculo-skel? etal system was created in the software pack- age Maya. The foundation for digital move? ment in this model, as in life, is to be found in the complex workings of the axial skeleton. This paper will address some of the prob? lems involved in the creation of this anima? tion for the entertainment industry, as well as highlighting the potential such modeling has for improving the quality of information presented in the scientific literature. Video clips of this animation will be presented. 17.6 ILSE, LM*, HELLGREN, EC, Okla? homa State University, Stillwater. Porcupines, pinyon pines, and pine engravers: what's the connection?

The goal of this research was to test the hypoth? esis that porcupines, Erethizon dorsatum, predispose the papershell pinyon pine, Pinus remota, a Pleistocene-relict species, to colonization by pine engraver beetles of the genus Ips. We studied porcupine ecol? ogy, pinyon pine physiology and physiognamy, and beetle-pine associations on a study area in the southwestern Edwards Plateau from June 1997 to August 1999 to elucidate relationships among these 3 or? ganisms. Porcupines primarily were located in pinyon pines. Pines damaged by porcu? pines were greater in girth (P &lt; 0.006), taller, (P &lt; 0.001), and had greater resin flow rates (P &lt; 0.001) than paired undamaged trees (n = 183 pairs on 20 transects). The distribu? tion of bark beetle infestations varied (P &lt; 0.01) between damaged and undamaged trees. Although attacks by beetles were evi? dent on both types of trees, successful colo? nization was greater on pines damaged by porcupines. Intensity of porcupine attack, indexed by number of feeding scars and amount of bark removed, was also associ? ated with greater colonization rate by bark beetles. Our data on these interspecific re? lationships are of regional interest relative to conservation of this unique pinyon-juni- per woodland, and of wider value as a model system showing the role of distinct phyla that define community structure in forest and woodland ecosystems. S2.5 INNIS, J.W., University of Michigan School of Medicine. Integrative biology and the developing limb bud. The identification or selective construc- tion of mutations within genes has allowed researchers to explore the downstream ef? fects of gene disruption. Much information has been generated and knowledge has advanced rapidly. However, a limitation in our assessment of the consequences of con- ditional changes, and thereby our under? standing of roles or function, is the degree to which we examine the effects of our manipu- lations. It is also clear that linear associa? tions are incorrect models for describing de? velopment, and newer methods now allow us an opportunity to practice an integrative biology. In our attempts to explore the con- sequences of Hoxal 3 disruption in mice and humans, it has become clear that a full un? derstanding may only be achievable by tak? ing a broader approach with a long-term view. Fundamental questions relative to Hox gene function in vertebrates including how many target genes, what degree of overlap in target genes exists, what magnitude of modulation is exerted, which genes are ac? tivated versus repressed, and what classes of molecules are involved need to be ex? plored if a thorough conceptual understand? ing is desired. To this and other ends, we have undertaken a comprehensive analy? sis of the expression of genes within devel? oping limb buds of mice. Our efforts will fur? ther the 1) exploration of the broader ge? netic relationships of expressed genes, 2) determination of parallels or variations in tar? get usage for a given gene in different tis? sues and between different organisms, 3) evaluation of limb patterning mechanisms in other animal model systems, and 4) ex? ploration of gene expression hierarchies regulated by HOX proteins in developmen? tal systems.

Without evolutionary information, the adaptive significance of interspecific differ? ences in both morphology and function are difficult to discern. Here, I outline the utility of applying evolutionary approaches to func? tional morphology in general, and perfor? mance in particular by using two model sys? tems. First, I test the hypothesis that perfor? mance capacities can predict both the aver? age habitat use and habitat breadth that Anolis lizard species use. I also ask whether one can predict the kinematic characteris? tics of species based on their morphological and performance characteristics. To answer this latter question, I rely on data from the three-dimensional kinematics of high-speed locomotion in lizards. Using an explicitly evolutionary approach for both studies showed that performance capacities were excellent predictors of habitat use in Anolis lizards. In addition, while there was not a global correspondence between morphol- 1072 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Both studies are good examples of the utility of incorporating evolutionary and eco? logical information for understanding how species specialize to their environments. 21.6 IRSCHICK, D.J.*, JAYNE, B.C, University of California, Berkeley, University of Cincinnati. A comparative field study of the arboreal locomotion of lizards. Few studies have rigorously quantified the habitat and movements of arboreal ani? mals, particularly in a comparative context. We quantified the available habitat, habitat use and movement patterns of three mor? phologically different arboreal Anolis lizard species at a field site in Jamaica (A. lineatopus, A. grahami and A. valencienni). We focused primarily on how the inciine and diameter of perches affected the preferred speed of locomotion. The habitat was domi? nated by narrow perches (70% of perches were less than 1 cm diameter) and steep inclines (44% of the inclines were greater than 70 degrees). All species used steep inclines at similar proportions as available in the habitat, but they also used shallow inclines (&lt;25 degrees) at greater frequen? cies than available in the habitat. One spe? cies (A. valencienni) primarily used narrow perches, whereas the other two species pri? marily used broad surfaces, despite the pau- city of such perches in the habitat. The ma? jority of movements were short in distance (&lt;15 cm), and relatively slow. For example, for A. grahami, 90% of the speeds were less than 40% of maximum capacity. Two spe? cies (A. valencienni and A. grahami) tended to move on steep uphill surfaces more often than on steep downhill surfaces, but A. lineatopus exhibited the opposite trend. Multiple regression analyses revealed that average speed per movement was signifi? cantly affected by the distance per move? ment, inciine, perch diameter and perch height. Lizards moved more slowly when they were on steep uphill compared to steep downhill perches, and also when they were on broad compared to narrow perches.

Suspension feeding versus kleptoparasitism in a marine snail. Although suspension feeding is a domi? nant feeding mode in the marine realm, is performed by members of many diverse taxa, and has evolved at least seven times within the prosobranchs, suspension feed? ing is rare among snails. In a group that ap? pears extremely versatile, why arenit more snails suspension feeders? In order to ap? proach this question, I am studying the ma? rine caenogastropod Trichotropis cancellata. This snail is capable of suspension feeding, but the majority of its populations also par? ticipate in kleptoparasitism, usually stealing food from tube-dwelling worms. The Trichotropis/worm symbiosis is a system where a suspension feeding snail is facing limitations that can at least be reduced by a shift to parasitism. Kleptoparasitism is com? mon for snails of all sizes at sites from Wash? ington to Alaska, and proportions of the population involved in parasitism varies sea- sonally. In the San Juan Islands, Washing? ton, parasitic snails have faster growth rates and correspondingly higher fecundities than suspension feeding snails. Host size does not affect growth rates in parasitic snails. Al? though host species does not appear to in? fluence snail growth rate in the summer, snails grow faster on sabellids than on serpulids in the winter. Finally, the discovery that another species within the Trichotropis genus is restricted to suspension feeding indicates that kleptoparasitism has arisen at least twice within the superfamily and sug? gests possible factors driving the shift to para? sitism.

The Styelidae is a family of ascidians in the suborder Stolidobranchiata that contains both compound and solitary species, as well as several species with intermediate mor? phologies. In the ascidians, coloniality is strongly associated with other reproductive traits including brooding, large egg size, and production of large, short-lived, well-differ- entiated larvae. Solitary ascidians cannot reproduce asexually and are generally free- spawners with small eggs and simple lar? vae. To examine how many times coloniality and its associated traits have evolved within the Styelidae, a region of about 1000 base pairs in the central part of the 18S rDNA of 27 ascidian species was used to construct phylogenetic trees. In addition, complete 18S sequence was used in selected spe? cies from the original dataset to obtain bet? ter resolution on some branches with low bootstrap support. Preliminary results sug? gest that coloniality has arisen only once within the Stolidobranchs and that 'social' species with intermediate morphologies are sister taxa to the rest of the colonial species. This implies that ancestry, rather than adap? tation, may be the key to understanding the evolution of coloniality in the Ascidians. A detailed comparative analysis of other life history and developmental traits may begin to elucidate the critical evolutionary steps that can lead to a switch between solitary and colonial lifestyles. 41.1 JANOVETZ, J, University of Chicago. Feeding in serrasalmine fishes: a compari? son of suction and biting prey capture. Most fishes capture prey by suction feed? ing, rapidly expanding the oral cavity to cre? ate an inward flow of water that transports prey into the mouth. This type of prey cap? ture is primitive for osteichthyes and has been the subject of considerable research. Other forms of prey capture can provide a valu? able contrast to this behavior but have re? ceived less attention. Biting is the dominant form of feeding in a wide variety of fishes including parrotfishes, triggerfishes, and characins of the subfamily serrasalminae (pacus, silver dollars, and piranhas). This study examines the trophic anatomy and ki- nematics of prey capture in a variety of serrasalmine species to correlate morphol? ogy and feeding behavior with natural diet. Measurements of jaw lever mechanics were used to compare the biological design of the feeding system. Jaw lever ratios ranged from approximately .3 - .5 within the subfam? ily. Species that primarily bite seeds or pieces from animal prey tend to have lever mechan? ics emphasizing force production while spe? cies that feed on scales or whole fish have lever mechanics emphasizing velocity of jaw closing. To compare feeding behaviors, pacus (Piaractus), piranhas (Pygocentrus), and silver dollars (Metynnis) were filmed with high-speed video while capturing prey by either suction or biting. Relative to suction feeding, biting was characterized by lower values for gape, gape cycle time, and hyoid depression. These data suggest that biting is a distinct method of feeding and that serrasalmine fishes can modify prey cap? ture according to prey type.

Sex determination is a fundamental trait of organisms that reproduce sexually, yet the tremendous diversity of sex-determining mechanisms remains largely unexplained. The origin of and variation in types of envi? ronmental sex determination (ESD) are par? ticularly enigmatic. In this talk, I explore the ecological relevance and quantitative ge? netic underpinnings of an especially curi- ous pattern of ESD called Type II tempera? ture-dependent sex determination (TSD). I first evaluate temperatures measured in natural nests with respect to both pivotal tem? peratures (Tpivs) of Type II TSD determined in the laboratory. Subsequently, I estimate heritabilities of sex ratio at both Tpivs, GxE for sex ratio, and the genetic correlation be? tween both Tpivs in common snapping turtles. The results suggest that the ecologi? cal relevance of Type II TSD is questionable and that this pattern of TSD may simply be maintained by genetic constraints. 1074 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

Heterochrony in amniote evolution. Heterochrony is thought to be a major link between developmental mechanisms and the emergence of phenotypic difference above the species level (macroevolution). Heterochronies affecting the timing of dis? crete events are of particular importance during organogenesis. Within vertebrates, this is the mid-embryonic period when the body plan is specified under the control of regulatory genes, and when major organ primordia develop. Previous studies have identified putative heterochronic changes (e.g. in somite formation) during this key pe? riod, but these have not been quantified or tracked systematically across evolutionary history. In part, this is due to the difficulties inherent in analysing comparative develop? mental data. We have developed a new pro? tocol, based on 'event-pairing', for quantify? ing heterochrony and mapping it across the evolution of different animal groups. It im- proves upon earlier event-pairing methods by adding an en bloc comparison of the shifts along each branch of the tree. This can de? termine the shifts of individual events rela? tive to all other developmental events sur- veyed, and can identify the stronger trends. Using data from vertebrates, we track timing shifts in embryonic organ development. These include delayed eye development in mammals and advanced heart development within the amniotes. We explore possible functional and adaptive explanations for these shifts (e.g. the evolution of endot? hermy). We also subject the data to a parsi? mony analysis to identify instances of con? vergence (homoplasy). In future, our ap? proach may be adapted to analyse other forms of comparative dynamic data.

In freeze tolerant frogs, a principal com? ponent of freezing survival is the production and distribution of cryoprotectants (glucose or glycerol) from liver glycogen stores. The size of these stores limits the absolute amount of cryoprotectant produced during a freezing bout, consequently impacting freeze-tolerance. Additionally, in R. sylvatica, liver glycogen is depleted as a result of mul? tiple freeze-thaw cycles. We froze chorus frogs for 2-3 24h bouts over the winter pe? riod of 1998 and 1999 to determine the en? ergetic cost of freeze-thaw cycles in this spe? cies. Frogs surviving the initial freeze-thaw bout survived subsequent freezing bouts. However, in contrast to R. sylvatica, multiple freeze-thaw cycles failed to significantly re? duce liver glycogen stores or change glyco? gen phosphorylase activity. Freezing sur? vival was unexpectedly low, thus prompting a secondary investigation into the relation? ship between hepatic glycogen reserves, glucose mobilization and freezing survival in chorus frogs. In all cases freezing in P. triseriata resulted in significant increases in the levels of glucose in liver and muscle tis? sue. However, levels of cryoprotectant and liver glycogen of animals in the current study were significantly lower than in previous stud? ies where freezing survival was better. Low levels of liver glycogen may be the explana- tory factor for the decreased cryoprotectant levels and increased mortality. The frogs in this study showed a positive correlation be? tween liver mass and liver glycogen. Cur? rently, it is unclear if this correlation can be extended to body size, but such a relation? ship seems likely. 56.6 JENNINGS, D.H.*, WEISS, S.L, MOORE, M.C., Arizona State University, Tempe. Ontogenetic changes in embryonic yolk steroid content in tree lizards: transfer of hormones from the developing embryo to the yolk? In oviparous vertebrates, hormones that accumulate in the yolk during gametogen- esis regulate development and can affect a variety of morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits.

Later in development, at day 25 of the 36 day incubation, yolk P levels were higher in males than females. Levels of T, E2, and CORT at this stage were similar be? tween the sexes. Between day 25 and 30, P declines in males but not in females. Other hormones change little during this period. Unlike the other steroids measured, yolk CORT levels increased during embryogen? esis. We have also shown (1) that embry? onic adrenal glands secrete CORT prior to hatching and, therefore, may be a potential source for the increase in yolk CORT and (2) that CORT may be necessary for hatch? ing: only 10% of eggs treated with RU486 (a P and CORT inhibitor) hatched compared with 90% hatching success in eggs treated with vehicle or R Although preliminary, these results suggest that CORT may mediate hatching in tree lizards as many of the RU486-treated eggs contained living em? bryos. Our results suggest that ontogenetic changes in yolk steroids are more complex than previously thought. Yolk hormone con? tent is not simply a function of maternal pro? visioning, and hormones produced by the developing embryo during late stages of de? velopment also may contribute to yolk hor? mone content.

Fundulus heteroclitus (Mummichog) is a euryhaline teleost that is common along the western Atlantic coast from the maritime provinces to Florida. This species has a semi? lunar reproductive cycle that is accompa? nied by large changes in plasma levels of triglycerides, the production of vitellogenin (vtg), and changes in plasma lipoproteins. Estradiol implants were used in this study to determine the role of estradiol in lipid trans? port, and gonadal and hepatic growth. Mum? michog were collected from the Canary Creek near Lewes, DE in unbaited minnow traps. They were maintained in the labora? tory for one month prior to implantation. Silastic implants were inserted in the perito- neal cavity through a small incision. Fish were sacrificed on the third, seventh, and fourteenth day post-implantation. Gonado- and hepatosomatic indices (GSI and HSI respectively), plasma levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, liproteins, and estradiol were measured. Preliminary results indicate that estradiol reduced GSI, and at low doses also reduced HSI and messenteric fat stores. Estradiol also induced the production of vtg, and at day seven reduced plasma triglycer? ide levels. Unfortunately, plasma lipopro? teins and lipids have yet to be fully analyzed to this point. However, it is clear that estra? diol plays an important role in altering lipid transport to accomidate spawning in the mummichog. 45.5 JERNVALL, J.*, KERYNEN, S.V.E., THESLEFF, L, University of Helsinki, Finland. Quantifying evolutionary modification of de? velopment in mammalian molar topography. Mammalian dentition is characterized by complex and diverse molar cusp patterns and subtle changes in molars are usually the earliest morphological evidence of mod? ern orders in the fossil record. However, the exact ways that embryonic patterning of tooth shapes could change to result in the docu? mented evolution have been difficult to char? acterize quantitatively. We have developed topographic methods using Geographic In? formation Systems (GIS) to analyze changes in developing teeth. We performed GIS analyses on cusp formation and gene ex? pression in the first lower molar of two spe? cies of muroid rodents, the house mouse and the sibling vole. The evolutionary lin? eages of muroids are well represented in the fossil record, thus providing a good ba? sis for discerning the types of developmen? tal processes in evolutionary transforma? tions. We identify two hierarchical develop? mental processes, prepatterning and propa? gation, that can be implicated in mouse and vole molar evolution. Firstly, digital elevation models and cross-correlation analysis show that evolution in lateral cusp topography, af? fecting location of cusps and crests, results from coordinated changes in molecular prepatterns preceding the first cusps. Sec- ondly, evolutionary increase in longitudinal cusp number results from accelerated lon? gitudinal growth and faster propagation of 1076 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

The di? versity of mammalian molar cusp patterns may largely result from these two develop? mental processes, limiting the independence of individual morphological features used in evolutionary studies.

A review of the re- wards for the big, dumb and socially inept: interactions between the adrenocortical stress response and life-history events of marine turtles. The acute adrenocortical stress response (ASR) is an important defensive mechanism that promotes physiological and behavioural attributes that can increase survival of verte? brates in the face of pervasive stimuli. How? ever, some vertebrates modulate their ASR to stressors to promote alternative behavioural and physiological functioning. In this study, I examined the association be? tween the ASR and various life-history events of marine turtles, an ancient reptilian group with an unusual life-history. In par? ticular, I have examined the capacity for modu? lation in the ASR of marine turtles in asso? ciation with key life-history events, including natal dispersal, ontogeny, and reproduction. An effort was made to examine this relation? ship in the presence of many natural stres? sors, such as social and environmental stres? sors, in addition to a more typical capture stressor. It was evident that marine turtles exhibit a great capacity to modulate their acute ASR to stressors. In particular, as adults, breeding females decrease the ASR to capture and ecological stressors com? pared to non-breeding females. In contrast, adult males exhibit partial adrenocortical modulation, in which intermale aggression and courtship damage fails to induce an ASR, however a typical capture stressor is associated with a pronounced ASR. In sum? mary, there is a strong association between life-history events and the ability of marine turtles to modulate their ASR. Some possible explanations are presented to clarify the in? teractions between the marine turtle ASR and their life-history. 24.1 JINDRICH, D. L *, FULL, R. J, Univer? sity of California at Berkeley. Dynamic stabi- lization of rapid hexapodal locomotion. Mechanical properties of muscles, con? nective tissues, and skeletal elements con? tribute to reducing energy costs, but can also simplify the control of rapid locomotion in animals. Passive mechanical behavior ofthe musculo-skeletal system may play a role in stability. Rapidly acting, musculo-skeletal 'preflexes' have been hypothesized to con? tribute to disturbance rejection during rapid movements and can augment the actions of a neural feedback controller. To assess the role of 'preflexes' in the stabilization of rapid locomotion, and to study the control strate? gies used by hexapods to stabilize locomo? tion, we subjected cockroaches (Blaberus discoidalis) to short-duration perturbations during rapid running.The perturbations were generated using a small device attached to the animal's dorsal surface, positioned just above the animal's center of mass. The de? vice used black powder to propel a ball bear? ing laterally as the cockroach ran along a track. The reaction force from the explosion generated a perturbation to the animal's lat? eral velocity with a force impulse of 60-70% of the forward momentum of a 2 gram cock? roach running at its preferred speed of 25 cm/s. The duration of force was less than 10 milliseconds. Lateral velocity began to de? crease 14 +/- 8 S.D. milliseconds from the onset of the perturbation. Cockroaches were able to recover from lateral perturbations (i.e. lateral velocity returns to within the range observed during unperturbed running) in 37 +/- 10 milliseconds. The rapid recovery of lateral velocity supports the hypothesis that fast-acting musculo-skeletal 'preflexes' may play a role in stabilizing insect locomotion.

Ontogeny of vision in marine crusta? ceans. Eyes of most adult crustaceans are spe? cialized for image formation and frequently for color vision or polarization vision as well; but those of larvae probably have more ba? sic functions. In contrast, eyes of adult crus? taceans found at hydrothermal vents lack image-forming optics and are specialized for the monochromatic detection of dim light. We studied the ontogeny of vision in the Pacific vent crab Bythograea thermydron. Adults of this species live at a depth of about 2500 m, but the larvae are probably pelagic, and the megalopae swim actively to settle at the vents. Eyes of four developmental stages (megalopa, juvenile 1 and 3, and adult), were examined with electron microscopy (TEM) and/or microspectrophotometry. B. thermydron megalopal visual pigment ab- sorbs maximally at -479 nm, and is thus well- suited for detection of downwelling light. Juvenile 1 (post-megalopa) eyes have rhab- doms with orthogonal microvilli like those of surface crabs with imaging eyes (e.g. Hemigrapsus), but lack a dioptric appara? tus. Rhabdoms of juvenile 3 retinas are hy? pertrophied relative to those in retinas of ei? ther juvenile 1 orsize-matched Hemigrapsus. Absorbance of adult visual pigment is red- shifted (peak -489 nm) compared to that of the megalopae; however, TEM examination found no neural retina in adult eyes. Megalopal and juvenile 1 retinas may be adapted to a pelagic/mesopelagic existence, while juvenile 3 and adult retinas are better suited to detect the dim, long-wavelength light emitted by hydrothermal vents. Remod- elling of structure and function at metamor? phosis is probably a common feature in crus? tacean visual development. P3.105 JOHN-ALDER, H.B.*, CARSIA, R.

Season-specific corticosterone re? sponses are apparent in S. undulatus (Horm. Behav. 36:39-52, 1999). These varying re? sponses may be due to season-related ad? renal programming. As a beginning point to investigate this hypothesis, we partially char? acterized the steroidogenic properties of adrenal cells derived from male lizards col? lected in September, 2000. Adrenal glands were dissociated using collagenase diges? tion and mechanical agitation. 'Adrenocorti? cal' cells were easily identified by their nu? merous large lipid droplets. Cells (1x105 adrenocortical cells/ml) were incubated with various test substances for 2 h at 34.5tC. Incubations were frozen (-30fC) until radio? immunoassay for corticosterone and aldos? terone. Cells exhibited high constitutive ste? roidogenic activity with basal corticosterone and aldosterone values of - 4 ng/103 cells/ h and 40 pg/103 cells/h, respectively. Al? though inducible responses were blunted (roughly twice basal values), cells were ex- quisitely sensitive to adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), responding to concentrations as low as 1 pM. Cells also responded to 8- bromo-cyclic AMP, but not to angiotensin II or the steroidogenic precursor, 25- hydroxycholesterol. The lack of a precursor response is suggestive of a saturated ste? roidogenic enzyme pool and is consistent with the high constitutive activity. Although it is unclear whether the overall responses of the lizard cells are related to season, this study demonstrates that this in-vitro ap? proach may be useful to resolve the hypoth? esis of season-specific adrenal program? ming.

Furthermore, using our laboratory growth data, we examine the heri? tability of juvenile growth rates. Our results show that SSD develops in the field before the end of the first year of age (before sexual maturity) because juvenile females grow more rapidly than juvenile males. In the labo? ratory environment, however, we observed no sexual difference in growth rates for liz? ards up to the size of maturity in the field. Thus, sexual differences in growth rate and subsequent development of SSD in this population are subject to strong proximal control. We found high levels of additive ge? netic variance for juvenile growth indicating a strong potential for selection to operate on juvenile growth rates. However, while se? lection on juvenile growth rate could explain differences in growth among populations, it would not necessarily contribute to SSD within our population due to the high plas? ticity in growth rate.

In addition, measurements of downwelling irradiance (from 330 to 500 nm) versus depth were made. The tissues from epipelagic zooplankton had lower UV trans? parency than those from mesopelagic zoop? lankton, while the average visible transpar- ency of the two groups was not significantly different. Percent transparency was posi? tively correlated with wavelength over most of the measured range, with a rapid de? crease below a certain cutoff wavelength. In mesopelagic tissues, the cutoff wavelength was generally 300 nm. In epipelagic tissues, the cutoff wavelength was between 300 and 400 nm. Twelve out of 19 epipelagic tissues had transparencies at 320 nm that were half or less than their 480 nm transparency val? ues, versus only 4 out of 21 mesopelagic tissues. The effects of UV absorption on UV visibility and minimum attainable depth were modeled using contrast theory and the phys- ics of light attenuation. Because UV absorp? tion was generally significantly greater in the UVB than in the UVA (where UV vision oc? curs), and because the highest UV absorp? tion was often found in less transparent indi? viduals, its modeled effects on visibility were slight compared to its effects on minimum attainable depth.

A large fragment of the mitochondrial ND2 gene was sequenced from a number of populations to assess the rangewide phylogeography of western hognose snakes, Heterodon nasicus. The resulting analyses designate Las Cruces, New Mexico, as representative of a deeply an? cestral lineage and suggest an intriguing mi? gratory history that identities the most de? rived populations of H. nasicus as being lo? cated in Texas. If supported by further analy? sis, this unusual pattern may shed light on the post-glacial activity of H nasicus (and perhaps other co-distributed species in the Great Plains) and the influence of geo? graphic events on its life history. This project also detected evidence of a new species of Heterodon, a conclusion strongly supported by the molecular data and seemingly in ac- cord with prior morphological work.

Genetic diversity within local populations of C. tigris (bisexual, 2N), C tesse/afus (unisexual, 2N), and C exsanguis (unisexual, 3N) was analyzed by the ran- domly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique. Using four different primers, Neiis index of similarity ranged from 54% to 87% in the bisexual species and from 37% to 72% in the unisexual species. However, the dif? ferences were not statistically significant. The similarity index for Cophosaurus texanus, a bisexual sympatric lizard from a different fam? ily (Phrynosomatidae), ranged from 29% to 79%, and was also statistically indistinguish- able from the three Teiids. Our results do not yet support the theoretical expectation that genomic variation increases with the evolu? tion of parthenogenesis, at least over the relatively brief history of the hybrid species in this study.

Brain specimens of sheep are convenient for classroom instruction in neurobiology. As an adjunct to use of these specimens, we have prepared a histologically detailed and labeled atlas of external features and inter? nal architecture of the sheep brain, at http:// www.brains.rad.msu.edu Included are im? ages of 110 coronal sections, in 55 pairs of sections. Both members of each pair are at the same antero-posterior level, but one is stained to show cell bodies, and the other is stained to show myelinated fibers. Individual sections can be selected for viewing from an array of miniature "thumbnail" views which includes all sections. Alternatively, sections can be selected according to the antero-posterior level indicated in views of the whole brain. When viewing a particular section, labels can be viewed or hidden. The stain can be chanaed from cells to fibers. and vice versa, at any time. Progress can be made from any section to the next, in either direction, without returning to the selection screens. Each section image is accompa? nied by a small image of the whole brain indicating the antero-poster level of the sec? tion, and a millimeter scale. Also included in the atlas are superior, lateral, and inferior views of the external surface, with external features labeled.

Feather origins and the myth of "feath? ered dinosaurs". The origin of feathers has been linked to flight and/or insulation. Recent discoveries of dinosaurs with feathers or presumed feather precursors have been used to sub- stantiate the latter hypothesis. However, analyses of the nasal passages and associ? ated sinuses demonstrates that dinosaurs and early birds, including Archaeopteryx, were likely to have been ectothermic and, therefore, would have no need for insula? tion. Additionally, the presence of feathers in Longisquama, a Triassic gliding archosaur, suggests that feathers did not originate among the Dinosauria and were associated with origins of flight. Moreover, cursorial bird? like running style of the only unambiguously feathered taxon (Caudipteryx, suggests that it may have been a secondarily flightless bird. Based on these data, we conclude that feathers preceded dinosaurs, that they were originally associated with flight, and took on an insulatory role in conjunction with the ori? gins of endothermy in birds.

McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="157">until recently thought typical for all verte? brates, does not incorporate a growing set of data documenting more than four Hox clusters in teleosts (zebrafish, medaka, etc). We are currently examining differences in Hox paralog group (PG) 1 gene deployment between teleosts and other vertebrates in order to test the hypothesis that the duplica- tions leading to increased Hox gene num? ber allowed evolution of new functions for Hox genes in teleosts. Experiments in our lab have established that the zebrafish PG1 genes have not only an altered gene comple? ment as a result of gene duplication (4 PG1 genes as opposed to 3 in mouse), but also differing expression patterns in relation to the murine PG1 genes. It has been assumed that Hox genes are important for patterning hindbrain and more posterior structures, but zebrafish PG1 genes may deviate from this classic model of Hox gene function as they exhibit expression patterns in the develop? ing midbrain. We are investigating PG1 genes in a phylogenetically relevant sample of vertebrates to infer the ancestral osteichthyan condition of midbrain expres? sion. We will discriminate between the op? posing hypotheses that (1) teleost midbrain expression is a novelty that evolved after Hox cluster duplications, versus (2) midbrain expression is a primitive condition that has been lost in the mammalian lineage. 17.5 JUDD, TM*, HERBERS, JM, Colo? rado State University. The effects of moisture and time of year on the foraging preferences of the ant Pheidole ceres. Colonies of the ant Pheidole ceres are faced with an environment filled with vari? able food sources. The colony must be able to allocate its foragers to these food sources in order to maximize its energy intake. In this study we explored the effects of two vari? ables, time of year and moisture availability, on the food preferences of Pheidole ceres. Both field and lab experiments were per? formed in which we manipulated the envi? ronment and colony composition to see how these variables affect the colony's foraging behavior and which individuals are involved in driving the colony's food preferences. 38.3 KAATZJM, Boston University Marine Program, Woods Hole. Structurally divergent sound producing mechanisms in a clade of arioid catfishes function in different behav? ioral contexts. Of the over 400 teleost fish families, 23% are known to have evolved two or more struc? turally and acoustically different sound pro? ducing mechanisms (SPMs). What is the func? tional significance of these independently derived SPMs? Structurally different SPMs are known to produce acoustically different sounds (Demski, Gerald and Popper 1973). Species with multiple mechanisms provide the opportunity to study how signal design relates to specific behavioral functions. Swimbladder and stridulation acoustic mechanisms differ in frequency range, tem? poral pattern and amplitude. I test the hy? pothesis that these two SPMs function in dif? ferent behavioral contexts. Twelve species of catfishs in the arioid superfamily were maintained in monospecific groups in aquaria in a sound proof room. The number of swimbladder and stridulation sounds pro? duced in intraspecific contexts (sounds hy? pothesized as conspecific targeted signals) were monitored with a hydrophone and re? corded on VHS. The mean number of focal samples per species was 60. The mean number of sounds observed per species was 176. Sounds produced by the same in? dividuals in the disturbance context (sounds hypothesized as predator targeted signals) were recorded in the field (recorded under? water while hand restrained). The mean number of sounds produced per species was 468. In intraspecific contexts swimbladder sounds were more abundant in ten species (69-100% of total sounds per species) and uncommon in two species (20- 30%). In the disturbance context stridulation sounds were more common in all except four species. The relative use of swimbladder and stridulation SPMs in different behavioral con? texts was species specific. S14.7KALTENBACH, J.C, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley.

To determine if simi? lar cells are also present in the internal gills of amphibian tadpoles, paraffin sections of gills, and of other tissues, were prepared from representative larval stages of the bull? frog and leopard frog (Rana catesbeiana and Rana pipiens) and from gills of the fresh? water goldfish (Carassius auratus). The fol? lowing techniques were then applied: 1) his? tochemical staining with four peroxidase- conjugated lectins for specific terminal sug- ars of glycoconjugates and 2) immunostaining with antibody to the ALPHA subunit of avian Na+/K+ ATPase. Certain epithelial cells in gills of both tadpoles and fish stained intensely with each of the four lectins (PNA for galactose, SBA for N- acetylgalactosamine, WGA for N- acetylglucosamine, and con A for mannose). However, ATPase reactivity was different in the gills of the two types of animals. In con? trast to the strong ATPase immunostaining in chloride cells of goldfish gills, little or no immunoreactivity was detected in amphib? ian gills. Yet ATPase staining was strong in the few flask cells present within the epider? mis of tadpole skin as well as in the tubules of the tadpole pronephric kidney. In conclu? sion, lectin staining indicated that specific terminal sugars on glycoconjugates are simi? lar in certain epithelial cells of gills of both tadpoles and fish. Moreover, the strong AT? Pase immunoreactivity in the tadpole pro? nephric kidney (as in chloride cells of fish gills), plus the very weak activity in tadpole gills, suggests that the pronephric kidney may play a more important role than the gills with respect to ion transport in larval am? phibians.

Captive S.parryiifrom Toolik Lake, Alaska were housed at University of Alaska Fairbanks and exposed to ambient tempera? tures (Ta) of +2, -5 and -12?C. Body tem? perature (Tb) was recorded via telemetry and rates of oxygen consumption (V02) and car? bon dioxide production were measured with open flow respirometry to estimate the ener- getic costs of ground squirrels during the re- entry phase of arousal episodes. Explana? tions of the mechanisms that allow hiberna? tors to depress metabolic rate during entry into torpor are controversial. Does meta? bolic rate drop as a consequence of Q10 ef? fects accompanying decreased Tb or Tbrajn, OR does Tb decrease as a result of tempera- ture-independent metabolic suppression? Preliminary data indicates that Q10 of Tb vs. V02 for trials at each Ta (+2, -5 and - 12?C)average 5, which is above the biologi? cally expected Q10 range of 2-3. This indi? cates metabolic suppression independent of body temperature. Rates of Tb cooling curves are different for trials run at the 3 T s, a ' with no change in the rate of V02 decrease. This also supports the metabolic suppres? sion theory. Tbrajn data will be examined. $10.8 KARR, T.L, The University of Chicago. The microbe that roared: Wolbachia rescue of a lethal Drosophila mutation. Wolbachia is an intracellular microbe harbored by a wide variety of arthropods in? cluding Drosophila. By unknown mecha? nisms, Wolbachia alters host reproductive biology usually to increase its representa? tion within a population. In Drosophila, Wolbachia is closely associated with ga- metic incompatibility and has undergone ex? tensive intraspecific horizontal transfer in na? ture. Neither the molecular mechanism of incompatibility nor the genetic interactions between host and microbe responsible for its persistence are known. In this report we describe the effect of Wolbachia on two alle? les of the insulin receptor substrate gene, Chico, recently implicated in the insulin-re- ceptor pathway of growth regulation in Droso? phila. Both lines containing the Chico1 and Chico2 alleles were found infected with Wolbachia and its removal significantly re? duced the viability of Chico homozygotes. In the most severe case, removal of infection "phenoconverted" Chico2 to lethality. Chico2 viability was restored upon reintroduction of Wolbachia either via microinjection or back- crossing into an infected maternal cyto? plasm. The degree of rescue was depen? dent on the levels of Wolbachia present. This unique rescue suggests Wolbachia interacts either directly with Chico or with elements of 1082 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

This is the first demonstration of genetic interaction be? tween Wolbachia and host signaling path? ways, and expands the repertoire of host/ symbiont interactions observed in this sys? tem. These results call into question the fun? damental nature of Wolbachia symbiosis and suggests robust evolutionary dynamics not previously appreciated. 31.6 KATZ, E.P.*, HILLMAN, S.S., NEOUCOM, Portland State University Cross-sectional area of the nasal pas? sages of the odontoceti. Implications for paleophysiology. In search of evidence bearing on the en? dothermic dinosaur hypothesis, a recent study by Ruben et al. (1996) revealed that endotherms tend to have larger nasal cross- sectional areas than ectotherms of the same mass. The reason offered for this observa? tion was that larger nasal passages are needed to house the complex respiratory turbinates posessed by endotherms. Whales were excluded from the study on the grounds that they have no nasal turbinates. In the present study, the cross-sectional areas of the nasal passages of nine species of Odontoceti were measured using latex casts. The regression of log cross-sectional area vs. log mass for the whales was the same as for the endotherms of the previous study. Alternative explainations for the large nasal cross-sectional area of endotherms are sought.

Regulating dif? ferentiation in vertebrates: functional homol? ogy and evolutionary co-option in Ikaros family genes. The Ikaros gene family of transcription factors is important in several vertebrate developmental pathways. Four paralogous genes in the family encode proteins that homo- and heterodimerize before binding to the DNA molecule, facilitating transcrip? tion of lineage-specific genes. In the work? ing model for the function of these genes, the proteins act sequentially to regulate the progress of differentiation along a cell lin- eage, with different Ikaros-family genes ex? pressed as the cells become more restricted in differentiation potential. Recent studies demonstrate that in vertebrates, the genes are expressed and/or function in diverse tis? sues, including neural, epidermal, and haematopoietic lineages. Progress in un? derstanding taxon-specific and tissue-spe? cific differences and similarities in expres? sion and function will be presented with an evolutionary perspective. S6.5 KELLY, D. A, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA. The functional morphol? ogy of penile erection: tissue designs that make the floppy stiff. Functional morphology focuses on how biological structures work in the natural world; the specifics of how any structure works depends in part on both the me? chanical properties of its materials and how those materials are arranged within the structure. For example, the tissue sur? rounding the penile vascular spaces of both mammals and turtles is made up pri? marily of collagen fibers. The tensile prop? erties of collagen let the tissue become stiffer as it extends during penile erection. But the specific organization of the col? lagen fibers also has a profound effect on the mechanical behavior of the entire pe? nile hydrostatic skeleton. Because the fi? bers are arranged in an axial orthogonal array, the erect penis is able to resist bend? ing and shape changes during copula? tion?unlike most biological hydrostats, which are flexible due to their arrangement of inextensible fibers in left- and right- handed helices. In the case of the penis, a low resistance to bending when erect could constitute a mechanical failure of the structure, because its primary function in both mammals and turtles is to enter the female reproductive tract for insemination.

Brief exposure to sublethal high tempera? ture induces protection against a variety of stresses (e.g., high temperature, oxidation, hypoxia) in many organisms. The breadth of protection conferred in this way suggests po? tential importance in defending the mam? malian central nervous system against the detrimental effects of ischemia and hypoxia. As part of our investigation into the effects of hyperthermia on neuronal function, we used standard whole-cell patch clamp techniques to determine whether thermal pretreatment alters the frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic and glycinergic synaptic trans? mission between neurons of the mouse pre- B-tzinger complex during subsequent hy? perthermia. Without thermal pre-treatment, heating the tissue from 30? to 40?C in? creased the frequency of spontaneous min- iature postsynaptic currents elicited by both glutamate and glycine by 1104.1 1 86.3% and 3582.8 1 142.6%, respectively. How? ever, a 15 min thermal pretreatment at 39.5? - 41 ?C one hour prior to such hyperthermia significantly reduced the increase in fre? quency of spontaneous transmission via glutamate to 456.5 1 43.4% above 30?C baseline (p &lt; 0.005) and via glycine to 1120.9194.8% above baseline (p &lt; 0.0005). Two hours following thermal pretreatment, hyperthermia-induced increases in sponta? neous transmission frequency remained sig? nificantly lower than those in tissues under? going hyperthermia for the first time (p &lt; 0.005 for both neurotransmitters). These data indicate that exposure of nervous tissue to temperatures experienced during high fe- ver or heat stroke induces an acclimatory response opposing extreme deviation from normal frequencies of spontaneous synap? tic transmission.

Using hormones to explore adaptation and constraint in a song- bird. We take an experimental approach to the evolution of life histories and the nature of adaptation and constraint. For the past 13 years, we have manipulated plasma levels of testosterone (T) in free-living male dark- eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), a socially mo- nogamous songbird. Males caught in early spring receive subcutaneous silastic im? plants that are empty (C-males) or packed with T (T-males). The dose of T simulates the maximum physiological level exhibited by unmanipulated free-living males prior to breeding. The goals have been (1) to docu- ment testosteronefs diverse effects on a wide array of phenotypic traits and (2) to relate affected traits to fitness in order to enhance understanding of the evolution of complex adaptations. Behaviorally, T-males sing more, have larger home ranges, and are more at? tractive to females, but feed their young less often. Physiologically, T-males have higher levels of corticosterone and corticosterone binding globulin, respond more strongly to stressors, and show signs of suppressed im? mune function. Overall, T-males devote more effort to seeking mates and less effort to pa? rental behavior and self-maintenance. With respect to fitness, T-males sire more young with their social mates and the mates of other males, but are less successful at rearing young at home. Recent work has focused on (1) whether phenotypic effects of T ex? tend to associates of treated males (mates and offspring) as reflected in egg dimensions and contents, offspring sex ratio, or immune status, and (2) potential consequences for females and males of a correlated response in females to selection favoring higher T in males. 65.2 KETTLE, C S, ARTHUR, W, Univer? sity of Sunderland.

Ef? fects of serotonin, FMRFamide-related and vasopressin-related neuropeptides on free amino acid mediated osmoregulation in a pulmonate snail. Osmoregulatory roles of serotonin and FMRFamide-related (FaRPs) in inverte? brates have been shown in previous stud? ies. We have studied the effects of seroto? nin, five FaRPs and three vasopressin-re? lated neuropeptides on free amino acid (FAA) mediated intracellular osmoregula? tion by the kidney of the pulmonate snail, Helisoma. The levels of various intracel? lular FAAs in isolated kidney tissue pieces were measured after 30 min in vitro treat? ment with serotonin or one of the above neuropeptides in physiological saline. For control, the tissues were treated in physi? ological saline alone. Compared to con? trols, the levels of FAAs increased signifi? cantly in various treatments. The treat? ments with neuropeptides were more ef? fective than serotonin.

Abdominal pressure during high speed locomotion in the Texas spiny lizard, Sceloporus olivaceus. In this study we measured pressure in the abdominal cavity of Sceloporus olivaceus at rest and during high speed lo? comotion on a trackway. During trackway lo? comotion, abdominal pressure fluctuates rapidly around mean pressure and appears to be correlated with footfalls. Preliminary results from two individuals indicate that mean abdominal pressure increases dur? ing burst locomotion. Mean abdominal pres? sure during locomotion increased above mean resting pressure by 3.61 2.3 cmH20 (0.36 1 0.23 kPa) in one individual and by 3.5 11.9 cmH20 (0.3510.19 kPa) in a sec? ond individual (mean 1 s.d.). Paired t-tests (paired pre-exercise and running pressures) showed that these increases were statisti? cally significant in both individuals (p&lt;0.0005). It is likely that these increased abdominal pressures are transmitted to the thoracic region since lizards lack a dia? phragm and the lungs and other internal or? gans are contained within a single cavity. Previous work has shown that lung ventila? tion decreases dramatically in lizards sprint? ing on trackways, and the proposed expla? nation is for this decrease is a mechanical constraint on hypaxial muscles (Carrier, D. R. 1987. Exp. Biol. 47: 33-42). We propose that increased abdominal, and therefore tho? racic, pressures may be an additional con? straint on ventilation during sprinting in liz? ards.

We repeated these behavioral ex? periments and found that young bees can distinguish odors by contact within a day af? ter they emerge, but need 4-6 days to de? velop responsiveness to airborne odors. Electroantennagrams (EAGs) correlated a reduced sensory cell response with this lack of sensitivity to airborne chemicals. NOS figures prominently in the bee olfactory sys? tem, where it aids odor memory. When we examined young bee brains for distribution and levels of NOS, they were lower in young bee antennal lobes. If young bees were forced to mature quickly by isolation from the hive, they showed increased sensitivity to airborne odors, an increased EAG re? sponse, and elevated NOS levels. Since NOS in the antennal lobe is from antennal sensory cells, these results suggest that young bees must modify these cellsf chemi? cal sensitivity and NOS levels in order to become sensitive to airborne odors. Whether these events are causative or merely cor- relative remains to be investigated. 24.3 KIRKTON, S.D *, HARRISON, J.F, Ari? zona State University, Tempe. Effects of allo? metric growth on oxygen sensitivity and jumping performance in the American locust. Body size changes within instars and across the lives of insects could have sig? nificant respiratory and locomotory conse? quences because of possible problems with oxygen delivery in larger insects. We inves? tigated the effect of across and within instar growth on performance during repeated jumping in the American locust, Schistocerca americana. Larger (older) grasshoppers fa- tigued more rapidly than smaller (younger) instars, both when comparisons were made across and within instars. We hypothesized that the poorer endurance of larger grass? hoppers was due to reduced oxygen deliv? ery relative to tissue metabolic needs. Grass? hoppers ranging from 2nd instars (0.08 g) to adults (2 g) were forced to jump up to 20 minutes in oxygen atmospheres ranging from 5 kPa 02 to 60 kPa 02. Hyperoxia had no significant effect on the endurance time of any age grasshopper. As juveniles in? creased in size/age endurance time became increasingly sensitive to hypoxia; specifically endurance time in 12 kPa 02 atmospheres relative to that in 21 kPa 02 decreased with size. This result suggests that larger juve? niles have less tracheal oxygen delivery capacity (or safety margin) relative to leg muscle oxygen needs. Adult endurance time was unaffected by hypoxia, suggesting that leg muscle activity metabolism in adults is nearly completely anaerobic. Body size changes within an instar also affected re? peated jumping performance. Within the 6th instar, grasshoppers that were four days older have 40% lower endurance times. In contrast to the general trend toward reduced endurance in larger (older) animals, adults that were 28 days old had similar endur? ance times when compared to 50% lighter 2 day old adults, suggesting that adult legs may undergo a compensatory mechanism to improve jump performance. 1.23 KISS, A.J.*, CHENG, C-H.C, Univer? sity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Gamma crystallins of Antarctic notothenioid fishes. The Notothenioidei suborder of teleost fishes of the Southern Ocean possess anti? freeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) that allow them to thrive in the habitually ice-laden Antarctic water. While the AFGPs are the most promi? nent adaptation of these fishes, other pro? teins have provided valuable insight into cold adaptation - lactate dehydrogenase, tubu- lin, and acetylcholinesterase. Gamma crystallins are the major lens crystallin in fish, therefore we have begun to characterise the Antarctic notothenioid GAMMA crystallins, to eventually determine whether there are adaptive changes regarding stability and polymerisation as a consequence of freez? ing temperatures.

The role of endogenous opioids in re? productive behavior has been studied in a variety of mammalian species. Additionally, amphibian locomotory behavior can be modulated by administration of the general opioid antagonist naloxone. The investiga? tion ofthe opioid system in reptiles has largely focused on the location and synthesis of central opioid peptides; however, the behav? ioral effects of opioids have not been fully addressed. We are interested in the pos? sible role of opioids in reproductive behav? iors of the whiptail lizard, Cnemidophorus velox. The reproductive behavior of Cnemidophorus involves a well-character- ized copulatory position called the "dough- nut." In this position, the male stretches his body into an are above the female and closes his jaw tightly on her midsection. During the doughnut, the bitefrom the male appears to immobilize the female, allowing the copula? tory position to be maintained for several minutes. We hypothesized that endogenous opioids mediate this temporary immobility, thus allowing the female to sustain the copu? latory position. We predicted that adminis? tration of a general opioid receptor antago? nist (naloxone) to the female would block the immobility response to the doughnut po? sition. The administration of high (10mg/kg body weight) and low (1 mg/kg body weight) doses of naloxone did not significantly af? fect female receptivity, the duration of the copulatory position, or the amount of loco? motory activity compared to saline controls. Because the peak response of naloxone in many species is between 10-30 minutes post-injection, we plan to investigate and re? port the effects of naltrexone, a longer-last- ing general opioid antagonist, on the same behaviors.

Lizards use either hyolingual or inertial transport mechanisms, both of which involve bilaterally symmetrical jaw movements. In contrast, most snakes ex? hibit a unilateral jaw-ratcheting mecha? nism that is characterized by asymmetri? cal jaw movements. Given the well-cor- roborated phylogenetic hypothesis that snakes are derived from lizards, this sug? gests that major changes occurred in both the structure and motor control of the feed? ing apparatus during the early evolution of snakes. Previous studies of the evolu? tion of feeding systems in snakes have fo? cused primarily on morphological features that were believed to have facilitated the elaboration of unilateral transport mecha? nisms within alethinophidian snakes. Un? til recently, however, scolecophidian snakes have generally been excluded from such analyses, despite their interme? diate phylogenetic position between liz? ards and other snakes. I used high-speed videography to study feeding mechanics in two families of scolecophidian snakes (Leptotyphlopidae and Typhlopidae). Leptotyphlopids were found to transport prey using a bilaterally symmetrical man? dibular raking mechanism. Furthermore, the morphology of the leptotyphlopid jaw apparatus suggests that prey transport in these snakes is mediated primarily by hy? poglossal rather than trigeminal muscula? ture. In contrast, typhlopids generally used an asynchronous maxillary raking mecha? nism during intraoral transport. As in alethinophidians, protraction and retrac? tion of the upper jaw arches in typhlopids are controlled largely by muscles of the constrictor internus dorsalis group. How- 800-955-1236 ?

Previous studies have shown that the crop-gizzard of the earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris responds to FMRFamide. Re? cently, we used immunohistochemical techniques to see where FMRFamide is localized in these tissues and an isolated tissue assay to determine how they re? spond to FLRFamide, which is also found in annelids. FMRFamide immunoreactiv? ity (ir-FRMFamide) was visualized by im- munofluorescent staining. Tissues were removed, fixed, embedded in paraffin, sec- tioned, and placed onto slides. The sec? tions were stained with rabbit antibodies to YGGFMRFamide, and visualized with goat antirabbit antibodies conjugated to fluorescene. As a control some slides were stained with preimmune rabbit serum. Slides were viewed and photographed with a fluorescent microscope. For the bio- assay the crop-gizzard was removed, con? nected to a force transducer, and placed in a tissue bath. Mechanical recordings of the contractions were made before, dur? ing, and after the application of increasing concentrations of either FLRFamide or FMRFamide. ir-FRMFamide was found in fibers and varicosities innevating the smooth muscle of both the crop and giz- zard. FLRFamide caused a biphasic re? sponse in contraction rate and amplitude. At 10 uM FLRFamide caused an increase in both parameters, while at 100 uM it caused a decrease in both parameters. The change in rate was similar to that seen with FMRFamide, however FMRFamide only caused a decrease in amplitude with a threshold between 1 and 10 nM. These results strengthen the hypothesis that FMRFamide related peptides may be used to control the movements of the crop giz- zard. Furthermore, it appears there are differences in how the receptor responds to the tetrapeptides. P2ABKNUTZEN, M., Iowa State University. Turtles in minature: an investigation into hatchling size manipulation. Eggs Of Apalone mutica were assigned to a yolk manipulation treatment(control, sham, 0.5 g removal, or 1.0 g removal) and incubated in moist vermiculite (-150kPa) at about 30.5 C. Three eggs from each of 7 clutches were assigned to each treatment for a total of 84 egg. Hatchlings began to emerge approximately 51 days after ovipo? sition. Hatching success was low among yolk-manipulated eggs (approximately 12%; nonsurviving eggs lacked embryos and signs of fungal infection, suggesting that mortality occurred early in development due to trauma caused by the aspiration proce? dure. Statistical analyses idicated a porportional relationship between egg mass and hatchling massand between the amount of yolk removed and the subsequent decrease in hatchling mass. Modifying aspi? ration procedure to improve hatching suc? cess would thus prove a valuable technique for experimentally manipulating neonate size. Interestingly, however, swimming and righting performance in the laboratory were unrelated to any measure of bosy size. Stil, the crucial tests of the relationship between body size, performance, behavior, and fit? ness remain to be investigated in the field. S11.15 KODITSCHEK, DE., University of Michigan.

High performance locomotion &amp;#8211; legged robots that are both stable and maneuverable over highly varied ter- rain &amp;#8211; now appear to be close at hand.

McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="165">bits. An Attractor is a collection of orbits against which arbitrary small perturbations result in small deviations that eventually settle backto it. This (local) notion of stability is particularly useful because it entails for- mally equivalent computationally effective conditions on experimental observables that apply to almost any model of biological in? terest. In contrast, developing empirically grounded and mathematically well founded paradigms for maneuverability, a non-steady phenomenon, remains an open problem. The (global) collection of non-steady devi- ant motions that settle down to an attractor comprise its Basin of attraction. Attractors with large basins and fast transients have offered useful (hybrid) building blocks for maneu? verability in robotics.The paradigm of hybrid global stability mechanisms may offer new directions of experimental inquiry and con? ceptual unity in biology if: i) computationally effective methods can be developed for their analysis and design in the high dimensional nonlinear settings relevant to animal loco? motion; and ii) the hypotheses they prescribe can be tied to specific aspects of animal bio- mechanics and physiology.

Can larvae of benthic animals use dis? solved chemical cues in wave-driven flow? Can chemical cues in the water affect the settlement of larvae of benthic marine inver? tebrates in habitats subjected to the wave- driven water flow that characterizes many coastal habitats? We addressed this ques? tion using larvae of the sea slug Phestilla sibogae, which metamorphose in response to a water-borne species-specific metabo- lite of their prey, Poritescompressa. P compressa is an abundant coral that forms reefs in shallow, wave-dominated habitats in Hawaii. We used dye releases and acous? tic doppler velocimetry to characterize the water flow above and within P compressa reefs. A flow regime mimicking the turbu? lence and waves measured in the field was created in a flume across a reef of P compressa skeletons; planar laser-induced fluorescence was used to quantify the fila- mentous small-scale spatial and temporal distribution of cue concentrations above the reef. Tethered larvae swimming in a mini- flume exposed to temporal patterns of cue mimicking those above a reef, rapidly re- tracted their ciliated velum (the swimming organ) when in filaments of cue. Larval bio- assays of cue strength in field-collected wa? ter elucidated patterns in the locations on a reef where water-borne chemical cues are strong enough to induce R sibogae larvae to stop swimming and sink. A series of field experiments monitoring the transport of lar? val mimics showed that P sibogae larvae sink rapidly enough to be retained on the reef when wave-driven flow moves across it.

I will recount the highlights of nearly a half century in the company of beautiful but deadly denizens of the south seas, with em? phasis on how integrative studies across several levels of organization and compara? tive studies across species in a single taxon contribute to understanding the evolution of biodiversity. I will raise (but not answer all of) the following questions: 1) The large num? ber of extatit species (&gt;500) and geologic youth (~55mybp) of Conus indicate a very rapid rate of new species formation. When, where and how did these speciation events take place? 2) Do molecular and geologic clock data integrate well? 3) In addition to high general species richness (GAMMA di? versity) many species co-occur at finer spa? tial scales (ALPHA diversity: up to 36 on a single coral reef). Do these species avoid competition by partitioning resources, and if so how? 4) In contrast, few species co-occur in other places. Why do some environments support many species, and others few or one? 5) How do the molecular properties of the venom peptides (conotoxins) integrate with feeding behavior and comparative ecol? ogy? And 6) what are their applications in other endeavors, especially neurobiology and medicine? 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Manipulating a visual sig? nal of sympathetic activity: influences on so? cial status and plasma Catecholamines. Darkening of postorbital skin in Anolis carolinensis occurs during stressful situa- tions, and is stimulated by adrenal catechola? mines via BETA2-adrenergic receptors. This eyespot forms more rapidly in dominant males during social interaction. It was hy? pothesized that eyespot darkening (green to black) is a social signal communicating sympathetic activation and limiting aggres? sive interaction. To assess the value of the eyespot as a social signal, males paired according to size and weight were painted postorbitally one with green paint and the other with black paint. The pairs interacted and social hierarchy was determined by counting aggressive behaviors such as ag? gressive displays, approaches, bites and chases. Males with eyespots darkened by black paint were dominant in 100% of inter? actions. Males with eyespots painted black also exhibited higher plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine levels than males with eyespots hidden with green paint and controls. The potency of the eyespot as a social signal serves as a catalyst that stimu? lates or inhibits the sympathetic nervous sys? tem in aggressive interactions between males.

Previous studies have shown that fight? ing behavior is the fundamental method for determining dominance between crayfish. Many factors are responsible for determin? ing dominance, including the crayfish's pre? vious fighting experiences. It has been shown that a crayfish that has had a previous win? ning experience by fighting another crayfish is more likely to win its next fight. This is termed the "winning effect". In this experiment, we tested how long this winning effect lasted by varying the time between a crayfish's win? ning experience and its next fight. Results showed that the longer the time delay be? tween the two fights, the more likely the cray? fish was to initiate a fight, but the less likely it was to win the fight. We conclude that while previous fighting experiences do influence a crayfish's likelihood of initiating and win? ning a fight, this effect is temporary and de? creases rapidly with time. This time period is between forty and sixty minutes in length. The period in which the "winner effect" takes place can play an important role in domi? nance and hierarchy formation. Further re? search needs to take into account the time between previous fighting experiences in order to assess a crayfish's chances of win? ning a fight accurately.

The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is a non-indigenous bivalve mollusc that is present in the waterways of North America. Previous research has shown that the neurotransmitter serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) can induce spawning in these animals. In other bivalves serotonin is also involved in the control of heart rate, smooth muscle tone, and neu? ronal activity. Therefore, we decided to search for serotonin in a variety of zebra mussel organs and tissues, including heart, transcardiac rectum, and anterior byssal re- tractor muscle (ABRM). Specimens were collected from the Mississippi River near Grafton, IL and kept at 10? C until used. Tis? sues were removed, fixed in Bouin's fixa- tive, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned in preparation for the staining process. The tissues were stained with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to serotonin. The secondary anti? bodies used to visualize the primary anti? bodies were goat anti-rabbit antibodies con- jugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. All tis? sues were examined with a fluorescent mi- croscope and photographed. Control slides were stained with serotonin antibodies, preincubated with 1 mM serotonin.The heart 1090 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Control sections of both rectum and heart showed no positive staining. In con? trast the ABRM displayed no specific stainining. The data suggest that serotonin is likely involved in the control of the heart and digestive tract as in other molluscs. Since this neurotransmitter can either be excitatory or inhibitory in other molluscs, we will need to perform bioassays with these tissues to establish its role. We are currently examining other zebra mussel tissues for the presence of serotonin. P2.23KRAUS-EPLEY, K.E.*, MOORE, PA, Bowling Green State University. The effects of antennal lesions on orientation behavior of the crayfish, orconectes rusticus. Numerous animals use chemical cues within their environments to execute vari? ous behaviors. One of these behaviors is orientation to a food source. Crayfish, in par? ticular, can orient to food sources under a number of different conditions. It has not been determined, however, if and how these animals with complete or partial impairment of their chemosensory appendages can suc- cessfully locate a food source. To determine the effects of impairment, the orientation pat? terns of crayfish with various degrees of an? tennal lesions were examined. Analysis of results confirmed that crayfish successfully locate distant food sources using chemot- axis and must have both antennae to do so. It appears that crayfish use the spatial infor? mation from bilateral sampling to success? fully orient. Animals using both antennae exhibited increased walking speed and speed to source, decreased heading angle towards the source, and a more linear path than animals with the use of one or neither antenna(e). It was also found that other chemosensory appendages, including chelae and walking legs, play a lesser role in orientation than may have been previ? ously thought. S8.8 KRENTZ, D, Walt Disney Feature Animation. Design of digitally animated char? acters: biological solutions for fantastic situ- ations. Design of animals in animated films must balance the needs to make them believable as organisms and interesting as characters that interact with a defined storyline. Morphological construction for or? ganisms focuses initially on musculoskel? etal anatomy. Initial designs attempt to re? main as true to actual structure as pos? sible. Even the retention of correct posi- tioning of such small elements as the su- praorbital bones in certain dinosaurs was a consideration in the recent film Dinosaur. Given that dinosaurian skeletal anatomy is well known for many taxa, this initial step may be fairly straightforward. Character design proceeds until each can be repre? sented by orthographic drawings and three-dimensional sculptures (maquettes) that guide animators through film produc? tion. In the case of predominantly digitally generated films such as Dinosaur, ap- proved orthographic drawings and maquettes direct computer modelers, and computer animators produce the moving, on-screen characters. However, truth and fantasy are necessarily hybridized to sat- isfy the demands of story and production decisions. The most typical examples are when nonhuman characters speak or en? gage in other anthropomorphic behaviors. In these cases, the generation of fanciful behaviors are often derived from basic bio? logical solutions. In the example of prog- nathous iguanodontids in the film Dino? saur, there was no true reptilian model for facial expression. In this case, mamma? lian muscles of facial expression were adapted from horses to provide a working model for facial movement with reason? able proportions. Ultimately, animated films do not necessarily remain true to animal physiognomy at all times, but when they depart from nature, problem-solving for novel functional combinations frequently returns to the kinds of solutions that "na? ture dictates." 800-955-1236 ?

Populations of the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) in western North America that are found in the same range as the coastally distributed rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) display resistance to the poisonous effects of the newtis tetrodotoxin (TTX), while common garter snake popula? tions outside of the range of the newt do not display TTX resistance. In an effort to un- cover the evolutionary pattern of TTX resis? tance in the common garter snake, we col? lected 2218 nucleotides of mitochondrial DNA sequence data including complete ND2, partial ND4, and partial cytochrome b gene sequences.

S7.5 KRISTENSEN, R.M., University of Copenhagen. An introduction to Loricifera, Cycliophora, and Micrognathoza. Adult loriciferans are bilaterally sym? metrical marine metazoans between 108- 485 microns. The body is divided into five regions: mouth cone, head (introvert), neck, thorax and abdomen. The first description of a loriciferan (Nanaloricus mysticus) was in 1983 from specimens collected from shell gravel off the coast of France. The fine struc? ture of the mouth cone, the introvert and the circumenteric brain indicate that the phylum is related to Kinorhyncha and Priapulida. An- nulation of the flexible buccal tube, telescop- ing of the mouth cone and three rows of placoids in the triradiated pharynx bulb are found only in Tardigrada and Loricifera, but may be convergent. The marine Cycliophora is the most recently described animal phy? lum. Cycliophorans are bilateral acoelomate metazoans with a well-differentiated cuticle. A single microscopic species (Symbion pandora) was described in 1995. Cycliophorans appear to be a new type of epibiont with a very complex life-cycle living mainly on the setae of the mouthparts of sev? eral lobster species. Cycliophorans have some similarities to sessile rotifers but are considered related to entoprocts although a molecular study suggests that cycliophorans could be related to Syndermata (Acantho- cephala + Rotifera). A new microscopic aschelminth-like animal, Limnognathia maerski with complicated jaws was de? scribed in 2000. It was assigned to a new class, Micrognathozoa within Gnathifera, which now includes Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa and Syndermata. The ul? trastructure of the jaw suggests homology to jaws of gnathostomulids and the rotiferan mastax. Limnognathia maerski has dorsal plates formed by an intercellular matrix as in Rotifera and Acanthocephala, but ventrally the epidermis is "naked" with a thin glycocalyx. The gross anatomy of the body consists of a head, thorax and abdomen. The locomotory organ consists of two rows of cells with cilia. 12.3 KROCHMAL, A.R.*, BAKKEN, G.S., Indiana State University Evidence for the use of facial pits for behavioral thermoregulation in the western diamondback rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrorf. Pit vipers (Crotalinae) possess unique organs, called facial pits, which can detect subtle fluctuations in emitted thermal radia? tion. Facial pits are used for prey location and strike direction, demonstrating that pit vipers can incorporate thermal information into their behavioral patterns. Though never thoroughly investigated, such thermal infor- 1092 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="169">mation could play a significant role in the thermoregulatory behavior of pit vipers. Be? havioral thermoregulation can impact social and foraging behaviors, increase predation risk, and impart physiological costs. Locat- ing thermally favorable microsites efficiently would minimize these constraints, and the ability to do so should be favored by natural selection. Emitted thermal radiation is a di? rect indicator of an object's surface tempera? ture, and the ability to use it as a behavioral cue would allow pit vipers to efficiently de? tect thermally favorable microsites. There? fore, we hypothesized that pit vipers might use their sensitivity to emitted thermal radia? tion to locate thermally favorable microsites from a distance. In preliminary Y-maze trials, snakes were able to locate thermally favor? able microsites more often than predicted by chance (p&lt; 0.01, sign test). Thus, West? ern Diamondback Rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrorf may have the ability to use the ther? mal sense to locate thermally favorable microsites in the absence of other cues. 19.4 KUFFNER, I.B., University of Guam Marine Laboratory, Mangilao. Effects of ul? traviolet radiation and water motion on the reef coral Porites compressa: a transplanta? tion experiment. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280 - 400 nm) is an important ecological variable affecting coral reef organisms, but UVR effects may be influenced by other factors such as water motion. In this study, the effects of ambient UVR and water motion on several physi? ological parameters of the reef coral Porites compressa were investigated in a factorial transplantation experiment. Branches from nine different colonies were transplanted from the windward side of Coconut Island (Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii) to a control area on the windward side (ambient water motion) and to an area on the leeward side (low water motion). Transplanted corals were placed under UV-opaque or UV-transparent filters fixed to the reef. Initially and at three and six weeks, coral branches were weighed to determine calcification rate, and tissues were extracted to analyze photosyn? thetic pigments and the concentration of the UV-absorbing compounds, mycosporine- like amino acids (MAAs) via HPLC. When UVR was screened from the corals' envi? ronment, total MAA concentration decreased by 33 % over six weeks. The presence of UVR resulted in higher concentrations of MAAs in UVR-exposed colonies compared to colonies shielded from UVR. However, UVR-exposed corals moved to low water mo? tion decreased MAAs while UVR-exposed corals moved to the control area retained initial levels. Photosynthetic pigments and calcification rate were also significantly lower in corals moved to low water motion. There was no UVR effect on photosynthetic pig? ments or calcification rate. This study pro? vides evidence that water motion is impor? tant for the maintenance of MAAs. However, there were interesting colony-specific pat? terns in MAA composition in response to the UVR treatment, indicating a genetic (host, zooxanthellae or both) component to UVR resistance. 25.6 LABARBERA, M.

Effects of body size on the predatory strike of the western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrotf. Changes in body size can be of particu? lar importance to feeding mechanics, yet little information is available for allometric effects on terrestrial vertebrate feeding systems. The predatory strike of rattlesnakes, along with the great range of sizes exhibited both ontogenetically and interspecifically within this taxon, allows us to test whether changes in body size constrain the evolution of strike performance. Multiple strikes from ten west? ern diamondback rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrotf of varying sizes were filmed using a high-speed video camera (1000 fps), and a diversity of speed, distance, and behavioral parameters were analyzed. Intraspecifically, smaller snakes are predicted to have higher maximum accelerations based on the allom? etry of force generation and body propor? tions. However, body scaling data indicate deviations from isometry in several body measurements, such as head volume. 64.4 LAMBERT, J.D, NAGY, LM, Univer? sity of Arizona. The role of MAPK signaling in patterning mollusc embryos. Classical experiments performed on the embryo of the mollusc llyanassa obsoleta demonstrate that the 3D macromere acts as an embryonic organizer, by signaling to other cells and inducing them to assume the correct pattern of cell fates. We have discov? ered that MAP Kinase (MAPK) signaling is activated in the cells which require the sig? nal from 3D for normal differentiation. Pre- venting specification of the D quadrant lin? eage by removing the polar lobe disrupts the pattern of MAPK activation, as does ab- lation of the 3D macromere itself. Blocking MAPK activation with the MAPKK inhibitor U0126 produces larvae which differentiate the same limited complement of tissues as D quadrant deletions. Our results suggest that the MAPK signaling cascade transduces the inductive signal from 3D and specifies cell fate among the cells that receive the sig? nal. We also report the pattern of MAPK ac? tivation in other mollusc embryos, and dis? cuss the implications for the evolution of axial patterning in this group. 60.4 LAMMERS, A.R., Ohio UniversityThe effects of inciine and branch diameter on the kinematics of arboreal locomotion. It is likely that the common ancestor of Mammalia was small, quadrupedal, and scansorial. To better understand the kine? matics of arboreal locomotion in a primitive, scansorial mammal, I examined the effects of branch angle and diameter on limb pos? ture, speed, gait and duty factor in the South American possum Monodelphis domestica. Animals were filmed (250 f/s) walking up ar? tificial branches of different angles and di? ameters. Kinematic data were then mea? sured from the videos. Data indicate that branch angle (up to 45 degrees) has little effect on limb kinematics for these small mammals. These results may explain why Taylor et al. (1972, Science 178:1096) found that low substrate inciine had less metabolic effect on running mice compared to chim? panzees; furthermore, Vilensky et al. (1994, J. Hum. Evol. 28:375) found kinematic differ? ences with substrate inciine in squirrel mon? keys. Therefore, as mammals become larger over evolutionary time, the effects of gravity and mass appear to cause changes in ar? boreal kinematics. 10.5 LANCASTER, W.C*, WARD, S., JONES, G., SPEAKMAN, J.R., Pikeville Col? lege School of Osteopathic Medicine, Uni? versity of St. Andrews, U.K, University of Bristol, U.K, University ofAberdeen, U.K En? ergetics of biosonar vocalization in station- ary insectivorous bats.

McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="171">wide variety of calls while at rest including biosonar calls of high intensity in some spe? cies. The propensity of bats to make echolo- cation calls at rest is variable and studies suggest that energetic constraints may un- derlie this variability in behavior. We mea? sured the energetic expenditure associated with biosonar call production at rest in five species of insectivorous bats using respirom- etry. The species use distinct modes of for? aging and this is reflected in call structure, intensity and phrasing. Oxygen consump? tion associated with vocalization increased with rate of call production. The slope of the plot of watts vs. call rate gives mean cost per call. This cost was greatest in Eptesicus serotinus at 0.22 J/call, was 0.19 in Myotis myotis, 0.12 in Pipistrellus pipistrellus, 0.03 in Pteronotus parnellii and in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum was 0.03 J/call. Costs per call were inversely related to the species' propensity to produce calls at rest. In three species where data are available, energy flux density of calls averaged 7.63 x 107J/ m2 in R. ferrumequinum, 3.69 x 107 in P pipistrellus and 2.30 x 10~7 in M. myotis. In the other species, P parnellii has calls of simi? lar intensity and duty cycle to R. ferrumequinum and E serotinus is similar to Pipistrellus. Bats that produce the most vo? cal energy at rest are expending the least amount of energy in doing so. We suggest that these species have behavioral and mor? phological adaptations to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of producing biosonar calls at rest.

Ancient Mediterranean ships' hulls were "carvel builf, that is, the strakes (longitudi? nal planks of the hull) were fastened to each other edge-to-edge by mortise and tenon, whereas the Vikings and other sailors of the northern seas, used "clinker builf hulls, in which the strakes overlapped each other Jaterally and were held together by clench nails. It is thought that clinker built hulls are better able to resist the poundidng of the rough northern seas. This may be because the overlapping planks can, to a small de? gree, ride up over each other without start- ing (springing leaks.) Specifically, clinker built hulls appear better able to resist tor? sion. In carnivores, canine teeth are used asymmetrically; that is, stress is predomi- nantly on one side producing torsion at the rear end of the skull. Overlap of bones is quite common in mammals, but a deep, scarfed overlap of the squamosal over the parietal is found in carnivores, suggesting that skull structure may parallel clinker con? struction, for the same mechanical reason. In addtion, the ossified tentorium cerebelli of carnivores may serve the same purpose as a rib in a ship's hull in resisting torsional deformation.

Regulation of potentially con- flicting behavior and physiology during mi? gration. The avian stage of migration is com? prised of distinct sub-stages within which potentially conflicting issues are at work: energy mobilization during flight, versus energy storage during fueling. Therefore, precise control of behavior and physiology during different sub-stages is critical for effi- cient travel. Corticosterone, the glucocorti? coid found in birds, regulates metabolism and feeding, and may participate in the con? trol of migration. I examined the pattern of corticosterone secretion across different mi? gratory sub-stages in a long-distance shore? bird migrant. Levels of corticosterone were elevated prior to and during migratory flight as compared to the refueling sub-stage, sug? gesting that corticosterone may promote behavioral and physiological process typi? cal of departure and flight. Because baseline levels of corticosterone were far below those during capture, I suggest that corticosterone may play a role during migration that is dis? tinct from stress effects. To explore the be? havioral role of corticosterone during migra? tion, I experimentally manipulated circulat? ing levels in captive migrants and monitored resulting differences in behavior. Birds with low levels of corticosterone tended to inves? tigate the mudflat and cage floor less than 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

In addition, birds with low corti? costerone titers tended to decrease body mass, even though feeding behaviors were not affected. These results suggest that an elevated level of corticosterone promotes awareness of the environment and assists in the maintenance of the body mass peak typical of departure. On-going studies will verify these data and clarify the physiologi? cal role that corticosterone may play during migration. S3.8 LANGENBACH, G.E.J., Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam, The Neth? erlands. Mammalian feeding. In mammals, basic symmetrical food transport cycles have been described for lapping and soft food ingestion. To increase chewing efficiency a unilateral occlusal mo? tion has been evolved replacing the slow closing phase in the basic cycle. This power stroke is preceded by fast opening and clos? ing phases increasing the gape. Jaw open? ing is produced by action of the digastrics and hyoidal muscles, often supported by activity of the lateral pterygoid muscles. Ac? tivity of these muscles is usually asymmet? ric, moving the jaw to the working side. The relative uniformity of the mammalian jaw closer motor patterns is striking. Neverthe- less, several specialisms, clearly different from the primitive mammalian asymmetric mastieatory motor pattern, can be distin? guished. Weijs (1994) proposed to categorise these into four groups, the carni- vore symmetric, the rodent symmetric, the transverse and the alternate patterns. In con? trast to the relative uniformity in motor pat? terns, the anatomical diversity of jaw sys? tems is impressive and probably reflects the adaptation to diet. Mostly in the last decade, this diet influence has been investigated. With tougher foods, an increase in the clos? ing activity has been found, in combination with a prolonged duration and often ex? tended transverse dimension of the power stroke. Data suggest that the individual mas? tieatory cycles are largely shaped by sen? sory feedback. Also the suckling food intake preceding mastication has been a point of interest. It seems that mammals use expres? sion and suction mechanisms to collect the milk. Both motor patterns resemble that of mastication, suggesting that transition could be gradual. Recently, dynamic computer 3D- modeling has emerged as an analytical tool. The approach has the potential to help ex? plain how structure and function interact, and to elucidate the existence of different feed? ing motor patterns. 66.6 LANNOO, M.J.*, NANJAPPA, P, BLACKBURN, L.M., Muncie Center for Medi? cal Education, Indiana University, Ball State University, Muncie, IN, Ball State University, Muncie, IN What amphibian malformations tell us about causes. Amphibian malformations in northern and eastern regions of North America have generated considerable attention from both the general public and the scientific com? munity. Common malformations of ranid frogs collected by the Minnesota Pollution Con? trol Agency include missing limbs (eetrome- lia) and multiple limbs (polymelia). Despite the co-occurrence of both types of malfor? mations among animals in any given hot spot, and the disparate locations of hot spots, some researchers argue that discrete factors cause different malformations (Kai- ser, 1998, Science, 278:2051-2052; Souder, 2000, A Plague of Frogs, Hyperion Press). Gross and radiographic analyses show that two unusual features ? spongiform bone and dorsal pigment abnormalities ? appear in a subset (74%) of malformed ranids. Such bone and pigment abnormalities are diffi? cult (bone) or impossible (pigment) to detect in cleared and stained animals. The pres? ence of spongiform bone and dorsal pig? ment malformations proximal to the missing limb region strongly argue against preda? tion being the main cause of ectromelia. Spongiform bone and pigment malforma? tions also appear in polymelic animals. The presence of these abnormalities in both ec- tromelic and polymelic animals argues two things: 1) a shared cause, manifested differ? ently depending perhaps on dosage or variations in exposure; and 2) the rejection of hypothesized causes that do not produce these malformations. 1096 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

Isometric contractile properties of anuran jaw muscles and their relation? ship to feeding mechanics. All terrestrial frogs examined to date use tongue prehension to capture prey. Three categories of feeding behavior have been identified in frogs with respect to tongue per? formance during prey capture. Tongue per? formance characteristics that vary markedly among taxa in the different behavioral cat? egories include percent elongation of the tongue, and maximum tongue velocity and acceleration during protraction. Previous research on the isometric contractile prop? erties of the tongue protractor and retractor muscles did not reveal functional differences that explain this variation in tongue perfor? mance. One factor that may cause differences in tongue performance is the transmission of inertial forces via jaw movements during feeding. Jaw opening velocity and accelera? tion is greater in species that exhibit greater elongation, velocity, and acceleration of the tongue during its protraction. As a first step towards elucidating the role of jaw move? ments in effecting tongue protraction, we compare jaw muscle contractile properties of representatives of two feeding behavior categories. In situ experiments were per? formed in which muscle origins were left in? tact. Removal of a lower jaw section isolated muscle insertions, which were attached to a force transducer. Via direct muscle stimula? tion, we quantified the length-tension curve, contraction time, half-relaxation time, stimu? lus frequency-tension curve, and fatigability of each muscle. With these data, we test the hypothesis that jaw muscles of species with faster, more greatly elongating tongues have shorter contraction times and greater force production.

Differences in distribution of NPY and NPY receptors in a sex changing fish. Saddleback wrasse (Thalassoma duperrey) a protogynous sex-changing fish from the Hawaiian Islands, have behavioral differences based on sex and social roles. Dominant, territorial terminal phase (TP) males can develop from either females or initial phase (IP) males. Previous work indi? cates that neuropeptide Y (NPY) can stimu? late release of gonadotropins in fishes. Ad? ditionally, NPY has been show to stimulate sex reversal in the congener T bifasciatum. NPY and peptide YY (PYY) are closely re? lated peptides that bind to the same recep? tors. Fish were collected from reefs during time of daily mating. PYY was labeled with 125l and applied to brain sections to deter? mine receptor distribution. Anti-NPY was also applied to sections to determine peptide dis? tribution. Females had receptor binding in the dosomedial zone. TP males had recep? tor binding in hypothalamic, preoptic area (POA) and tuberal nucleus. All three pheno? types had receptor binding in optic tectum (OT). Distribution of NPY-like immunoreac? tivity (NPY-LI) occurred in the same regions as receptor binding. The fact that NPY-LI and receptors are found in OT of all fish is probably related to vision. The differences in phenotypes suggests that in this species NPY affects regulation of sex or sex roles. T duperrey demonstrates sexual plasticity via protogyny. NPY could play a role in main? taining the sexual status of individuals in this system when social cues inducing sex re? versal are absent. The presence of NPY-LI in the POA of TP males corresponds with earlier results in T bifasciatum indicating that TP males have greater GnRHir in POA. This suggests that NPY plays a role in mainte? nance of sexual status of TP males, likely via control of GnRH. 67.2 LARSON, P, Ohio University.

Reduced major axis regressions of 11 linear chondrocranial measurements on size indicate a mixture of allometric and isometric scaling. Measurements in the otic and oral regions tend to scale with negative allometry and those associated with the palatoquadrate and muscular process scale with isometry or positive allometry. Geomet? ric morphometric analyses, based on a set of 11 chondrocranial landmarks, include lin? ear regression of relative warp scores and multivariate regression of partial warp scores and uniform components on log centroid size. Results indicate that body size explains about one quarter to one third of the total shape variation found in the sample. Areas of regional shape transformation (e.g., otic region, trabecular horns) are identified by thin-plate spline deformation grids and are concordant with linear morphometric results. These results indicate that the anuran chon- drocranium is not a static structure during the pre-metamorphic stage with allometric patterns generally following scaling predic? tions for tetrapod cranial development. 2.2 LAURITZEN, D V*, HERTEL, F, GOR- DON, M.S., University of California, LosAn- geles, California State University, Northridge, University of California, Los Angeles. Kine? matics of salmon leaping up waterfalls. Fish ladders have been used for hun- dreds of years to help migratory fishes move upstream past human-made obstacles such as dams. The designs of these ladders ap? pear to have given little consideration to the behaviors and leaping abilities of the fishes they are supposed to help. These inadequate designs seem partly a result of the paucity of information on the behavior and biomechan? ics of fishes as they leap. We hope to inte? grate biological considerations with the de? sign and construction of fish ladders by un? derstanding the preferences, capacities and limitations of wild fishes leaping up natural stream obstacles. We analyzed aspects of the biomechanics of leaping in sockeye salmon as they passed two natural water? falls during their spawning migration. Video recordings were used to track the fish as they traveled through the air and kinematic parameters of individual leaDs were auanti- fied. Stream characteristics were also mea? sured in the vicinity of the leaping fish. These results are summarized along with calcu? lated theoretical parameter values for suc? cessful leaps. We plan to conduct future stud? ies correlating the hydrology downstream of waterfalls with leaping salmonid kinemat? ics, both underwater and in air. These stud? ies will experimentally investigate the pref? erences of migrating salmonids at stream obstructions. These results along with the theoretical model describing successful leaps may be used in the development of fish ladders to help maintain a natural pas- sage rate of fishes up streams that contain human made obstacles.

Adaptation to small headwater streams and a concomitant reduction in overall size is a major evolutionary trend in percid fishes. Changes in behavior, such as habitat pref? erences and life history attributes, are often linked with changes in the proportionate sizes of corresponding regions of the brain. We examined the neuroanatomy among primitive percids (Perca and Stizostedion), primitive darters (Percina spp.), and more specialized darters (Etheostoma spp.) for evidence of simple scaling effects, correla? tion with adaptive changes in behavior, and phylogenetic legacy. A negative allometric relationship exists between body mass and brain mass in percids, indicating that dart? ers have proportionately larger brain mass than either Perca or Stizostedion. This may be a scaling effect. Changes in cerebellum and optic lobes are isometric. A positive al? lometric relationship exists between both the cerebellum and optic lobes and the olfac? tory regions. Differing proportions among brain regions in percids may prove to be adaptive and not a phylogenetic effect if it can be shown that darters rely more on vi? sion and agility in foraging and avoiding predators than do Perca or Stizostedion. 1098 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

Physiological consequences of supercooling and freezing for overwinter? ing insects. Freeze tolerance and enhanced super? cooling ability (freeze avoidance) are dis? tinct adaptations in insects facilitating sur? vival of subfreezing temperatures. It has been suggested that freeze tolerance has advantages over freeze avoidance with re? spect to certain aspects of insect ecophysi- ology. Third instars of the goldenrod gall fly (Eurosta solidaginis Fitch) were kept either frozen or supercooled at -5 C for 10 weeks. Supercooled larvae lost 26% of their wet weight (-15.2 mg) and frozen larvae lost 14% of wet weight (-8.3 mg), mostly as a result of water loss during the treatments. Moreover, although supercooled larvae lost more wa? ter than did frozen larvae (-13.5 mg vs. -7.9 mg), lipid content was stable throughout both treatments (approximately 10 mg per larva). Freeze-treated larvae were more likely to survive to pupariation (92% vs. 65%) and adult emergence (73% vs. 50%) than were supercool-exposed larvae. This insect spe? cies copes better with prolonged freezing than it endures prolonged supercooling. However, it remains to be clarified whether or not this effect can be attributed to differ? ences in water retention.

Independent invasions of fresh water: low-salinity tolerance and activity and expression of Na,K-ATPase in lineages of the copepod Eurytemora spp. The invasion of fresh water has occurred at least eight times independently in the sib? ling species complex Eurytemora affinis. We investigated the osmoregulatory role of an ion-pumping enzyme, Na, K-ATPase, in in? vasive and non-invasive lineages of E affinis and in a non-invasive congener E. americana. We measured enzyme activity and expression at salinities ranging from 0.25 to 25PSU. We also measured devel? opment time and survival in response to salinity. At low salinities, survival declined, development time increased, and activity of Na, K-ATPase increased by about 1.5 fold for E. affinis. In contrast, for E. americana, Na, K-ATPase activity declined with salinity and survival was 0% at the Iowest salinities. A positive correlation between Na, K-ATPase activity and survival at lower salinities sug? gests that this enzyme plays a role in fresh? water survival. However, the modest 1.5- fold increase in enzyme activity is unlikely to account for the required ion uptake. Immunostaining for Na,K-ATPase was local? ized to the ventral nerve cord, and did not appear to vary among populations, species, or salinities. Moreover, we were unable to find a distinct epitheiial-based organ or gland that could potentially function for ion excre? tion or ion absorption. Our results suggest that Na, K-ATPase may not be an important ion regulatory enzyme for maintaining hemolymph concentration in copepods in? vading low salinities, unlike the scenario as? sumed for most invertebrates. 21.1 LEE, D.

A defining characteristic of legged loco? motion is forward movement of the body over the feet, which remain more-or-less fixed with respect to the ground. This mandates that, in quadrupeds, the limbs retract about their proximal joints (i.e., hip or shoulder) during the entire stance. I used a simple, planar model to investigate the mechanical consequences of this kinematic constraint. The model consisted of a rigid body and two massless limbs (a fore- and hindlimb). The proximal segments were joined to distal portions of the limbs by rotational springs and were oriented either anteriorly or poste? riorly. The distal portions acted as compres? sion springs. Two basic assumptions were made in the simulation: 1) limb excursions are symmetrical with respect to a transverse plane through the proximal joint, and 2) the limbs retract with a constant angular veloc? ity that produces no net acceleration or de? celeration during stance. Given these neu? tral criteria, proximal segment orientation was found to produce substantial directional biases in ground reaction force during simu? lated trotting.

Production of antipeptide antibodies for detection of crus? tacean molt-inhibiting hormone. In crustaceans, the synthesis of steroid molting hormones, ecdysteroids, is nega? tively regulated by a neuropeptide molt-in? hibiting hormone (MIH). Amino acid se? quence data place MIH in the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) family. As part of our studies of the control of growth and molting in blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), we have generated antipeptide an? tibodies for detection of MIH. Using GCG (University of Wisconsin) sequence analy? sis software programs, two regions of the blue crab MIH peptide were selected for an? tibody production. These fragments were selected using multiple alignment and pep? tide structure programs that predicted re? gions of MIH having high surface probabil? ity, flexibility and antigenicity, but which were not highly conserved between MIH and other members of the CHH family. The two 10- mer peptides were commercially synthesized and used to generate polyclonal antisera in rabbits. The binding properties of the antis? era were characterized by immunocy- tochemistry (ICC) and Western blot. Thin section ICC showed specific immunoreac? tivity in the X-organ/sinus gland complex of eyestalk neural ganglia with both antisera. Western blot analysis revealed that both antisera also bound to proteins of the pre? dicted size in blue crab sinus gland extracts and cell lysates containing recombinant MIH protein. We anticipate that these antipeptide antibodies will be useful for developing an immunoassay for quantification of MIH in hemolymph. Supported by MS/AL Sea Grant and NSF.

Effect of season and age on the hypothalamic neuropeptide Y mRNA re? sponse to fasting in channel catfish. While food intake is likely controlled by a variety of interacting neuroendocrine factors, neuropeptide Y (NPY) has repeatedly been implicated in this complex behavior. NPY's affects on food intake in fish are likely local? ized to the hypothalamus and preoptic area. We investigated how hypothalamic NPY mRNA responds to fasting and how it differs between strains of fish known to grow differ? ently. Fish of two strains of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus; Norris and USDA 103) were kept at constant 26?C and 12:12 LLDD photoperiod from December (- 7 g fish mass) until June and subjected to monthly, 1-week, fasting challenges. During the study, USDA 103s grew significantly faster than Norris. The expected elevation in NPY mRNA did occur in response to fasting in catfish, al? though this response was not demonstrated throughout the study. During spring (Apr, fish -100 g), there was an elevation of hypotha? lamic NPY mRNA in fasted fish. In winter (Dec-Feb) and during the summer (May- June), there was no suggestion of this pat? tern. Plasma insulin levels also followed this general pattern of the maximum response to fasting (a decrease in this case) occurring in the spring. Our results suggest that 1) hypothalamically-produced NPY is impor? tant in the neural response to fasting, but that other areas of the brain are likely in? volved 2) the response of channel catfish to a fast varies with season and/or size 3) there are likely differences in the endocrine con? trol of feeding between different strains of catfish.

In this study, the distribution of NADPH- diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity was studied in Xenopus laevis tadpoles during embryonic and post-embryonic de? velopment by the histochemical reaction of NADPH-diaphorase that indicates the pres? ence of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the en? zyme responsible for nitric oxide production. Developmental stages were designated ac? cording to Nieuwkoop and Faber, (1967).The highest activity appeared at stage 37/38 and by stage 46/47, NADPH-d activity was widely distributed in brain especially in olfactory lobes, cerebral hemispheres and cerebel- lum which could be due to development of neuronal connectivities and synaptic plas? ticity. By the time tadpoles reached stage 52, there was complete lack of NADPH-d activ? ity in the brain. In this study we also show the enhancement of NADPH-d staining in re? sponse to retinol and retinol/thyroxine treat? ment in vitro. At the molecular level, the lev? els of mRNA for NOS increased significantly in response to these treatments. In conclu? sion, we propose a role for NO as a hor- mone-sensitive trigger, beginning the com- plicated cascade of events that lead to the remodeling of brain and regression of tis? sues such as tail during amphibian meta? morphosis. The presence and distribution of this enzyme in evolutionarily distant animals from mammals adds information about the role of nitric oxide in development. 11.2 LERMAN, D.N *, BETTENCOURT, B.R., Yl, CH, KIM, I., FEDER, M.E., Univer? sity of Chicago. Response of an Hsp70 gene cluster to laboratory and natural selection in Drosophila melanogaster. We investigated whether polymorphisms at the 87A7 hsp70 cluster, which includes 2 of the 5 genes encoding the inducible mo? lecular chaperone/heat-shock protein Hsp70, respond to natural and laboratory thermal selection in Drosophila populations. Our principal foci were morphs originally re? ported by Goldschmidt-Clermont (1980, Nucleic Acids Res. 8) as clones 122 and 56H8, and detectable by PCR and RFLP analysis. Allele frequencies covaried with evolution temperature in Drosophila melanogaster lines that have been cultured at different temperatures for more than 20 years and that differ in Hsp70 expression and inducible thermotolerance. Replicate lines evolving at 28/C fixed the 56H8-type morph, while those evolving at 18/C and 25/C fixed the alternative allele. Popula? tions selected for low knockdown tempera? ture (Gilchrist &amp; Huey, 1999, Heredity 83) also differed in 56H8-type allele frequen? cies from the control and high selected popu? lations. To test if hsp70 allele frequencies covaries with temperature in natural Droso? phila populations, we screened flies from "Evolution Canyon," a small canyon in Israel (200 m wide at base) with north- and south- facing slopes (NFS and SFS, respectively). Allele frequencies in the NFS differed sig? nificantly from those in the SFS. Allele fre? quencies also covaried with collection lati? tude in Australian Drosophila populations from tropical to temperate (gift of Ary A. Hoffmann). These results suggest that alle? les at the hsp70 87A7 cluster respond to ther? mal selection in both natural and laboratory environments. The functional significance of the alleles themselves (or of sequences linked to these markers) remains to be de? termined. Supported by NSF97-23298, 99- 86158, BSF98-00443, and HHMI.

Unlike that of any other terrestrial vertebrate, the sensory surface (macula) of the modern-frog saccule is detached from the wall of the otic capsule and suspended on a pool of periotic fluid.

The filter dynamics are remarkably complex, providing excellent temporal reso? lution, passing energy in the frequency range (10-150 Hz) appropriate for local seis- mic signals in the ground, and strongly re? jecting energy in the frequency range (be? low 10 Hz) occupied by typical microseis- mic background noise. For stimuli in the middle of the filter pass band, many indi? vidual axons exhibit conspicuous responses to vibrational accelerations of the order of 0.5 x 106g. In the field, the calling behavior often reflects this sensitivity, even very gentle footfalls producing a local area of silence among a chorus of male frogs. The airborne calls of the males of one species, Leptodactylus albilabris, often are accom? panied by a strong seismic component whose spectrum lies in the middle of the saccular-filter passband. Hoping to obtain definitive evidence of involvement of this component in male-male communication, we undertook what has evolved into a long series of behavioral studies in the field. These have centered about a timing gap in the male frog's advertisement call, produced in response to calls of conspecic males. S12.2 LEWIS, S.A., University Texas Medi? cal Branch. Extracellular modulation of epi? thelial permeability. One of the primary functions of an epi? thelium is to act as a barrier to the move? ment of substances between the lumen of the epithelium and the blood. Loss of epi? thelial barrier function due to cell death can lead to a loss of homeostasis and result in death of the organism. Proteins associated with eosinophils, certain bacteria and present in human semen have been demonstrated to be toxic to mammalian epithelial cells. The eosinophil proteins are major basic protein and eosinophil peroxidase, the bacterial protein is polymyxin B and the proteins found in semen are histones and protamine. A property shared by these proteins is a high density (15-80%) of positively charged (ba? sic) amino acids. The effect of these proteins on the mammalian urinary bladder epithe? lium was studied using electrophysiological techniques and confocal microscopy. It was demonstrated that these proteins cause cell death by interacting and increase the ion permebility of the cell membrane. Specifi? cally, we demonstrate that these proteins kill epithelial cells by making their cell mem? brane leaky to both cations and anions, re? sulting in cell swelling and ultimately cell ly- sis. Additional sites of protein interaction have been suggested from studies utilizing con? focal microscopy. A model for epithelial cell death by these positively charged proteins will be discussed, and includes protein- membrane interaction, a voltage dependent step, a recycling of membrane receptors and sites for divalent cation modulation.

Juvenile and adult blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, were collected from Cape Fear River and acclimated in the laboratory for two weeks to either sea water (1050 mOsm) or dilute sea water (150 mOsm). Gills were removed from crabs, homogenized, and assayed biochemically for Na+, K+-ATPase activity. For adult crabs, individual anterior and posterior gills were assayed individu? ally. For juveniles, anterior gills from indi? vidual crabs were pooled, as were posterior gills. Both anterior and posterior gills were also fixed and prepared for transmission electron and light microscopy. Gills from adult crabs acclimated to sea water showed low levels of Na+, K+-ATPase activity, although the posterior gills had twice that of anterior gills. Juvenile crabs (&lt;5g in weight) had en? zyme levels 11 times higher than those in the anterior gills of adults and 7.5 times higher in posterior gills in sea water. Upon acclimation to 150 mOsm, adult anterior gills displayed a 3-fold increase in Na+, K+-AT- Pase activity; posterior gills had a 4.3-fold increase. In contrast, the anterior gills of ju? venile crabs had a 4.3-fold increase, while the posterior gills demonstrated an 11-fold increase relative to sea water. Specific ac? tivity of Na+, K+-ATPase in juvenile gills at 150 mOsm was 15 times and 19 times higher than that of anterior and posterior gills of adults, respectively.

Locomo? tion in needlefish: anguilliform swimming with fins. Anguilliform locomotion involves the un? dulation of an elongate body axis and is char? acteristic of a diverse array of vertebrates, ranging from fishes to salamanders and rep? tiles. The Atlantic needlefish, Strongylura marina, is an elongate fish that displays anguilliform locomotion and also possesses a typical percomorph fin arrangement. While detailed body kinematics have been de? scribed for various anguilliform swimmers, no work has integrated the movement of the appendages during this mode of locomo? tion. In order to assess the role of the fins during anguilliform locomotion, I swam four needlefish (mean total length L= 24cm)in a flow tank at eight speeds (0.25- 2.0 Ls1) and captured simultaneous images of the ven? tral and posterior view using two synchro- nized high-speed video cameras. From these images I analyzed the kinematics of the body, pectoral fins, dorsal and anal fins, and caudal fin. Preliminary data show that at the Iowest speed the pectoral fins oscil- late at 3.7 Hz, while during the highest speed the pectoral fins are held flush against the body. The dorsal and anal fins move syn? chronously and are out of phase with body undulations at the lower speeds, leading the body during lateral excursions in a manner that suggests active control. At the Iowest speed the tail oscillates at 2.8 Hz, while at the highest speed the tail oscillates at 6.0 Hz. A large (133%) increase in the maxi? mum lateral tail displacement is observed across the range of speeds (atypical of te? leost locomotion), from 2.4% L at the Iowest speed to 5.6% L at the highest speed. Analysis of the trailing edge of the caudal fin at the Iowest speed shows that the dorsal lobe leads the ventral lobe, while at the high? est speed both the dorsal and ventral lobes oscillate at the same rate. 20.2 LICKLITER, CL*, NISHIGUCHI, M.K., New Mexico State Univeristy. Phylo? genetic characterization of the genus Vibrio based on morphological and molecular data. Vibrio fischeri and Vibrio logei are two species of luminous bacteria (GAMMA- Proteobacteria) that reside as symbionts in the light organs of a variety of sepiolid squids (Cephalopoda: Family Sepiolidae). These squids include the genera Euprymna and Sepiola, which are capable of exhibit- ing specificity towards their symbiotic asso? ciates. In order to better understand the evo? lutionary relationships between symbiotic vibrios and other related species that are pathogenic or benign, we have examined both phenotypic and molecular data to de? termine the phylogenetic relationships among particular Vibrio species. Phenotypic data was obtained by analyzing several bio? chemical processes (based on enzymatic capabilities), as well as measuring the growth rates of various bacterial strains in culture at two different temperatures (20/ or 28/C). We also amplified and sequenced both the 16S rDNA and glyceraldehyde phos? phate dehydrogenase (GapA) loci to obtain molecular sequence data for each of the Vibrio species used in the study. Combining both the morphological and molecular data between the different Vibrio species has al? lowed us to determine which species are genetically similar or distant, as well as help predict the evolutionary radiation of the sym? biotic, pathogenic, and free-living species of the genus Vibrio.

Receptor Regulatory volume decrease (RVD) in mudpuppy (Necturus maculosus) erythro? cytes depends on a K+ conductance that is activated during cell swelling. In addition, hypotonic swelling causes release of ATP into the extracellular medium, which leads to increased K+ efflux (Light et al. 1999. Amer. J. Physiol. 277: C480). This study was de? signed to determine the nature of the P2 re? ceptor involved in this process. The hemolytic index (Hl), a measure of osmotic 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

MICROmolar), ATP- GAMMA-S (50 ? MICROmolar), and 2-MeS- ATP (50 ?MICROmolar). In contrast, adenos? ine (50? MICROmolar), UTP (50 ? MICROmolar) and ?,?-Me-ATP (50 MICROmolar) had no effect on Hl. Further? more, Hl increased with the P2 antagonist suramin (100 ? MICROmolar) and the P2X inhibitor PPADS (10-100 MICROmolar), but not with the P2Y antagonist RB2 (10 MICROmolar). We also measured the per? cent volume recovery of cells following hy- potonic shock (0.5X Ringer) electronically with a Coulter counter. This value increased with extracellular ATP (50 ? MICROmolar), ATP?S (50 ? MICROmolar), and 2-MeS-ATP (50 ? MICROmolar). In contrast, suramin (100 ? MICROmolar) inhibited volume re? covery and this affect was reversed with gramicidin (5 MICROmolar). Adenosine (50 MICROmolar), UTP (50 MICROmolar) and ?,?-Me-ATP (50 MICROmolar) had no effect on RVD. Finally, we used the whole-cell patch clamp technique to measure ion cur? rents directly. We found ATP (50 MICROmolar) enhanced a K+-conductance that was activated during cell swelling. This current was inhibited by suramin (100 ? MICROmolar). Conclusion: our results are most consistent with extracellular ATP acti? vation of a P2X2 receptor during cell swell? ing, which in turn leads to volume decrease by enhancing K+ efflux.

Water and carbon dioxide flux in the flutter phase of the insect discontinuous gas exchange cycle (DGC). The insect DGC is characterized by ex? treme variations in carbon dioxide release and oxygen uptake rates. During the flutter or F phase of the DGC, oxygen diffuses in- wards from a ca. 21 kPa external partial pres? sure to a ca. 4 kPa internal partial pressure. Is this process augmented by inward-di- rected bulk flow, caused by a negative trans- spiracular pressure gradient, as Kestler and others surmise? JRBL and others have shown that diffusive processes appear to be sufficient to explain experimental observa? tions performed on F-phase carbon dioxide release. However, direct experimental evi? dence of F phase water vapor emission rates with reference to carbon dioxide release rates has been lacking because of the extreme sensitivity of the required measurements. These experimental measurements are im? portant, because arguments for the evolu? tion of the insect DGC that are based on restriction of respiratory water loss by the DGC, rather than the authors' argument that the DGC is primarily an adaptation to gas exchange in hypoxic and hypercapnic con? ditions, depend vitally on the nature and balance of the diffusive and convective pro? cesses taking place during the F phase. In this study we reveal the first experimental data on F-phase water vapor release and discuss the implications of our findings for the diffusive model of the DGC's F phase.

Sonoran mud turtles (Kinosternon sonoriense) have long been believed to be obligately aquatic, yet recent evidence sug? gests that populations in the extreme east? ern portion of the species' range thrive in habitats that experience annual drying. We compared the physiological response to dry conditions of K. sonoriense from two popu? lations: one from Arizona, in which turtles have been described as primarily aquatic, and one from New Mexico, in which exten? sive estivation has been documented. For comparative purposes, the responses of groups of K. flavescens (a well-documented estivator) and K hirtipes (a highly aquatic species) were also measured. All four groups were subjected to simulated dry-sea- son conditions in the laboratory. Resting metabolic rates and rates of evaporative water loss were measured prior to removal from water, after seven weeks of estivation, and following rehydration. Blood samples were drawn at the same intervals. Over the course of the study, Arizona K. sonoriense 1104 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Differences among groups were evident in rates of evaporative water loss, resting metabolic rates, and several blood chemistry variables, including Na+, K+, and BUN. The effects of behavior on physiologi? cal response to estivation were examined. 12.4 LIKNES, E.T*, SWANSON, D.L, Uni? versity of South Dakota. Seasonal metabolic acclimatization in the American goldfinch re- visited: to what extent does summit metabo? lism vary seasonally? Large seasonal changes in summit meta? bolic rate (Msum) have been considered only a minor component of winter acclimatiza? tion in small birds. This conclusion is based largely on data from Cardueline finches, in? cluding American Goldfinches. Recent evi? dence from a wider diversity of species sug? gest that relatively large winter increments of Msum (25-50%) are common among small passerines wintering in cold climates and are associated with improved winter cold tolerance. In this study, we evaluate seasonal changes in cold tolerance, BMR, and Msum for American Goldfinches from southeastern South Dakota. Goldfinches were captured in winter (Jan-Feb), spring (April), and summer (Jun-Aug) and tested on the day of capture. Cold exposure tests involved subjecting individual birds to a de? creasing series of temperature in 79%He/ 21%02 (helox) concurrent with open-circuit respirometry. The helox temperature elicit- ing hypothermia was designated the cold limit (Tcl). Winter goldfinches demonstrated significantly higher BMR (46%) and Msum (34%) and significantly lower Tcl (-9.5 vs. 1.3tC) than their summer counterparts. April goldfinches also showed significantly higher Msum (24%) and significantly lower Tcl (- 5.3fC) than summer birds. Winter birds had higher BMR (23%, P&lt;0.05) and Msum (9%, P=0.066) than April birds. Winter birds also had significantly lower Tcl than April birds. These data indicate that prominent winter increases in Msum are a component of win? ter acclimatization in goldfinches from South Dakota. Furthermore, seasonal changes in Msum accompany seasonal changes in cold tolerance, suggesting that Msum and cold tolerance are functionally linked. 33.4 LILLYWHITE, H.B., TU, M.C, Univer? sity of Florida, Gainesville. First ecdysis in? creases skin resistance to evaporative wa? ter loss in newborn snakes. Aquatic-terrestrial transitions associated with nativity present numerous physiologi? cal challenges for terrestrial vertebrates, one being the requirement to limit excessive losses of water due to evaporation. Epider? mal water barriers comprised of lipids pre- vent excessive water loss in the adults of most species, but little is known about de? velopmental mechanisms that establish or regulate these barriers. Newborn snakes typically shed their epidermis within a few days following birth, and behavioral changes are associated with this event. We employed 20 newly hatched California king snakes (Lampropeltis getula) to test the hypothesis that the first ecdysis is important for estab? lishing the epidermal barrier to cutaneous water loss (CWL). We measured CWL within three days of hatching and again at three days following the first ecdysis (9-14 days post hatching). Rates of CWL were quanti? fied using a RH/Dew Point meter to mea? sure water vapor density in partially satu? rated air flowing through an acrylic tube with and without a snake present. Each snake was anesthetized to eliminate movements and to minimize respiratory water loss. Boundary layer resistance was negligible in the conditions of our experiments. We found that CWL was significantly lower (37.1 ? 1.2 vs. 66.1 ? 4.3 |ig/cm2- h), and skin resistance higher (1118.2 ? 37.9 vs. 596.0 ? 31.6 s/cm), following the first ecdysis (P&lt;0.0001). Such changes might explain the reclusive behav? iors of newborn snakes and might also ter? minate parental care of newborn pit vipers that disperse away from parents following the first ecdysis. We are investigating this phenomenon in pit vipers as well as the like? lihood that increases in cutaneous resis? tance are related to the deposition of lipids within the epidermis. 800-955-1236 ?

Inhibitory ef? fects of methyl farnesoate (MF) on the re? productive development of tadpole shrimp (TS), Triops longicaudatus. To identify a reproductive regulator for the invasive TS, T longicaudatus, the hormone MF was administered to growing juveniles. To administer MF, aquatic vectors (Artemia nauplii) incubated in 0.05% albumin and 5 (ig/ml MF for 2 hours, were fed to TS daily from hatching until 10 days of development. Oocyte development was observed by dis? section at days 5 and 10. Body cavity exami? nation of day 5 TS was a mean of 33.2 oo? cytes in the controls and 16.5 in the MF treated (p&lt;0.002, ANOVA). Day 10 ovarian weight was reduced from a mean of 1.1 mg (controls) to 0.6 mg (MF treated) (p&lt;0.01, ANOVA). There were no somatic effects (body weights and lengths) between control and treatment groups at day 5 or 10. To study efficacy in rice fields, MF was added to shrimp pellets with Tween-20 as a binding solution at two treatment concentrations [low- 0.0001% = 1 mg MF/kg pellets (MF1) and high-0.001% = 10 mg MF/kg pellets (MF2)]. Initial lab tests of the pellets indicated the number of oocytes for MF1 treated TS at day 5 were reduced from the controls (p&lt;0.045, ANOVA). At day 10, ovary weight also de? creased (p&lt;0.01, ANOVA), with no somatic differences. The MF2 treatment at days 5 and 10 resulted in differences in body weight, body length, # of oocytes and ovarian weight, indicating a possible toxic effect. A random block design of 16 rings was set in a rice field to study the MF1 and MF2 pellet treat? ments. At day 5, MF1 and MF2 treatments decreased both ovary weight and GSI. No somatic effects were detected with MF1, however toxic effects were possible in MF2. At day 10, significant block effects obscured any MF effects. MF appears to inhibit ova? rian development when administered to ju? veniles. P1.84LOCKLAIR, M.R.*, GLAS, PS, The Citadel. Chitin type substances associated with the embryonic coat of the grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio. The focus of this investigation is to deter? mine if embryonic coat proteins are com- posed of chitin or chitin-type derivatives. The morphological changes in the embryonic coat were shown by Glas, et al., but the com? position of the embryonic coat has yet to be determined. Embryos were collected and their coats isolated during each stage of their embryonic development. The isolates were then electrophoresed on a gradient gel, fixed and stained for protein. Gels were also stained for glycoproteins such as chitin. Also, some isolates were treated with chitinase, N-acetylglucosaminidase or both. The result? ing supernatants and pellets were run on PAGE. The results suggest the presence of chitin or a chitin derivative in the embryonic envelope. Determining coat compostition can be beneficial in a number of ways. It could be of assistance in the culture of re? lated species as food sources, environmen? tal monitoring, and in the biomedical field. More specifically the production of chitin or N-acetylglucosamine production by the grass shrimpembryo might be of interest as a source of a flexible, resilient polymer for biomedical groups, or as a source of the glu- cosamine gene.

This coliection, along with isolated articulated specimens, forms the material basis of a study of ontogenetic change in the hindlimb of this Late Jurassic theropod dinosaur. Pre? vious research assumed isometric growth in the hindlimb of Allosaurus. However, re? cent work has called this hypothesis into question, suggesting instead that juveniles possessed relatively longer hindlimbs than adults. Hindlimb elements of Allosaurus have been subjected to gross morphological study and analysis of cross-sectional geometry.

In contrast, ontogentic series of femoral cross-sections exhibit strong positive allometry in eircum- ference, cortical bone thickness, and sec? ond moment of area. Moreover, femoral cross-sections exhibit a dramatic decrease in circularity. Specifically, greatest thickness in adult femora occurs in the caudomedial- craniolateral plane, directly associated with insertion of the major femoral retractor mus? culature (m. caudofemoralis). In total, these findings indicate substantial shifts in load? ing regimes during ontogeny. Ultimately, comparisons with extant taxa will be used to estimate changes in locomotor function. 16.1 LONDRAVILLE, R.L *, DUVALL, C.S., University of Akron. Fish respond to murine leptin injections by increasing intracellular fat metabolism. Green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) were injected (i.p.) with murine leptin over the course of two weeks to test the hypothesis that fish respond to leptin in a manner simi? lar to mammals. Leptin is a 16 kDa protein hormone that controls metabolic rate and storage of body fat in mammals; we recently demonstrated the presence of leptin in fishes. If leptin signaling in fishes is similar to that in mammals, then administering leptin should lead to loss of body weight, decrease of appetite, and increase in fatty acid me? tabolism. Fish were divided into three groups of 10 each; the first group received 10 jug leptin per day for 9 days and 20 jig for 5 days (IP injection); the second group received an equal volume of phosphate-buffered sa? line, and the third group was simply handled. All groups lost weight, but total weight, % dry weight, % body fat, cardiosomatic index and hepatosomatic index were not different among groups. However, two indicators of fatty acid metabolism approximately doubled in the leptin treated group: CPT in liver(carnitine palmitoyl transferase; 0.57 1 0.10; 0.28 1 0.10; 0.25 1 0.08 U/gm wet weight; LEPTIN, PBS, HANDLED, respec? tively; p&lt;0.05) and FABP in heart (fatty acid- binding protein; 85.616.1; 53.2110.1; 32.6 1 4.1 % relative signal strength; LEPTIN, PBS, HANDLED, respectively; p&lt;0.05). These data indicate that the leptin signaling pathway is present in fish, and that it triggers an increase in fatty acid oxidation.

Coop- erative learning in large undergraduate science classes. Cooperative learning exercises were in? corporated into large (-100 student) sections of introductory undergraduate classes in Bi? ology and Geology. 'Lecture' was reduced by more than half, with most of the class dedi- cated to working in cooperative groups. A variety of classroom assessment techniques were incorporated into the group exercises to evaluate basic knowledge, critical think? ing, synthesis of information, and attitudes about scientific issues. In-class group work, homework assignments, and pre-class read? ing quizzes accounted for up to 50% of avail? able points. Computer technology (multi- media, email and WWW) was strongly em? phasized. Comparing previous 'lecture' (L) sections to 'cooperative' (C) sections within instructors, and comparing L vs. C sections between instructors assessed impact of the change. Class attendance increased from -50% (L) to &gt;90% (C). Performance on com? mon questions between L and C sections was not significantly different; however, within the C section, scores were significantly higher on questions based on the C exer? cises than questions taken from a test bank (Prob&gt; F= .0018). Approximately 65% of stu? dents enrolled in the first semester of Biol? ogy (C) also enrolled in the second semes? ter, and 80% of that group enrolled in a sec? tion with the cooperative format vs. returning to the lecture format. These data, although preliminary, suggest that the cooperative learning format offers advantages over the lecture format. Anonymous surveys reveal that students overwhelmingly prefer C to L (88% vs. 12%) and approximately 75% of respondents believed that cooperative work helped them learn course material.

Chemical odor cues have been found to play an important role in the behavior and ecology of several species of juvenile or? ganisms, including crayfish. In crayfish, can- nibalism occurs among juveniles of differ? ent broods, therefore chemical signals that can convey maternal status may be impor? tant for protection. The aim of this study is to identify the role that maternal odor plays in the life of the juvenile crayfish, Orconectes rusticus. Past research has shown that young crayfish are attracted to chemical odors pro? duced by any ovigerous female that is not necessarily genetically related. Research also demonstrates that crayfish in the third stage of development, when recently sepa? rated from their mother, seek aid from her, acquiring protection when confronted by an unfamiliar chemical source. Our study tests whether juvenile crayfish are attracted to maternal odors and whether non-maternal odors are aversive. The third stage juve? niles were isolated and tested in groups of three individuals selected from the same brood in a Y-maze containing the paired chemical cues of two adults or various con? trols. The variable measured was the time spent by each juvenile in both sides of a Y- maze. Our results suggest that an attraction to maternal odor exists for juvenile crayfish. These results indicate that juvenile crayfish may have the ability to diseriminate between maternal and non-related female chemical cues. P2.62LOPEZ, Y, MOORE, A.M.F, Universityofthe Pacific. Assessing the weight that black widow gumfoot lines can pick up. Like other theridiid spiders, the black widow (Latrodectus hesperus) constructs gumfoot lines at the bottom of its cobweb. Gumfoot lines are vertical strands of silk that are tautly attached to the surface and de- tach easily when an insect touches them. Sticky droplets on the gumfoot line pull the insect into the air. Provided the insect is small enough, gumfoot lines are effective traps. In this study, we determined how much weight can be picked up by gumfoot lines. 27 black widows were housed separately. They were given wooden frames to encourage con? struction of gumfoot lines of uniform 10 cm length. We constructed 20 weights, ranging from 1-20 mg, out of insulated copper wire. We rolled each weight into 100 different gumfoot lines. The gumfoot lines either (1) broke, without lifting the weight, (2) broke and lifted the weight or, (3) attached to the weight but did not break. As the weight in? creased the percentage of threads that broke without lifting the weight increased, as did the percentage of threads that attached to the weight but did not break. As the weight increased a smaller percentage of gumfoot lines picked up the weight. The 1 mg weight was picked up by 95% of the threads while the 20 mg weight was picked up by 3% of the threads. The percentage of threads that pick up the weight appears to decrease loga- rithmically (R2 = 0.93) as the weight in? creases. Thus, gumfoot lines seem to be an effective trap for insects of 10 mg and smaller. Tests of live insects are ongoing.

The thermal dose (degree hours) neces? sary to determine the sex of Chelydra serpentina embryos was assessed over two nesting seasons (1996,1997) using pro- grammable incubators. A total of 48 clutches from Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Louisiana were divided among treatments and among experimental boxes within treatments where they were incubated fully buried in sand at - 7 kPa. All treatment incubators were pro? grammed to produce an average tempera? ture of 25 C, which is close to the average summer soil temperature at nest depth in Iowa. One incubator produced a constant 25 C incubation treatment (control). The other four incubators were programmed to pro? duce quasi square wave thermal pulses in the boxes (up 6 C and down 6 C for 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours in each daily cycle).

Effects of nectar concentration on water bal? ance, osmoregulation, and thermoregula- tion in a nectar-feeding sunbird. The water balance of nectar-feeding ani? mals is inextricably linked to their energy balance. Because nectar secreted by bird- pollinated flowers can be dilute, birds can be forced to consume high volumes of wa? ter to satisfy their energy demands. I exam? ined the consequences of feeding on dilute nectar for the African sunbird Nectarinia chalybea (Nectariniidae). Sunbirds ingested the same amount of sugar over a wide range of sugar concentrations by modulating volu- metric intake. When feeding on 0.2 M su? crase, birds consumed four times their body mass in water daily. Most of this water was excreted, with a remarkably small loss of electrolytes. Evaporative water loss was twice as high in sunbirds fed 0.2 M sucrase than in those fed 1.2 M sucrase. I estimated that birds used 10 % of their total daily en? ergy intake to warm 0.2 M sucrase from 20 oC to body temperature, in contrast to the negligible amount of energy used to warm 1.2 M sucrase. To compensate for the in? creasing costs of evaporative heat loss and food warming with decreasing food concen? tration, sunbirds maintained higher meta? bolic rates while feeding on lower nectar con? centrations. I hypothesize that the thermal insulation of sunbirds feeding on dilute nec? tar is higher than that in birds feeding on more concentrated nectar, because the in? crease in metabolic rate that I observed ac? counts only partially for the estimated costs of evaporative heat loss and food warming.

The evolution of primate hands: growth scaling registers with poste? rior HOXD expression. The hands of great apes and humans are very similar morphologically but differ systematically in digital proportions. This implies a modular basis of size. Since Ab- dominal-B-re\a\ed Hox genes have been shown to act as growth regulators in the autopod, we explored the size relationships among elements which share their expres? sion. Our measurements, taken from a bal? anced sample composed of all 5 hominoid genera (N=120), include the lengths of the proximal and distal radius (defined by the nutrient foramen), all 5 metacarpals, and the proximal 2 phalanges of each ray. Geomet? ric means of joint dimensions were used for size adjustment. An ontogenetic series was also collected for Homo, Pan and Gorilla. We also monitored the expression of poste? rior HOXD genes in developing murine autopods using whole-mount in situ hybrid? ization of riboprobes. In situ hybridization demonstrates that the growth plates of the distal radius and posterior 4 digits collocate with Hoxdl 1 expression. ANCOVA shows a strong relationship between the posterior rays and distal radial length, but none with its proximal segment. These data suggest that hominoid digit and distal forearm pro? portions are modulated by responses of growth promoting targets downstream of posterior HOXD genes. Similar, relatively simple, changes in gene expression can wholly explicate the probable pattern of evo? lution in the early hominid hand and fore? arm skeleton, including the emergence of unusually short posterior digits and forearms in the time period between Australopithecus garhi and Homo habilis/erectus. Such changes are likely to be related to develop- ments in lithic technology and to be com? pletely unrelated to locomotion. 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Developmental effects of testosterone on behavior in male and female green anole lizards. This study addressed the role of testoster? one (T) in the development of sexually di? morphic behavior in the green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis. We described the de? velopmental pattern of endogenous T con? centrations, and determined the behavioral effects of experimentally elevated T, in both juvenile males and females. T concentra? tions in the plasma of hatchlings from labo- ratory-incubated eggs and field-sampled ju? veniles of all sizes, as well as in the yolks of freshly laid eggs in the laboratory, were com? pared to plasma T concentrations in adult males and females. There were no sex-spe- cific differences in plasma T in hatchlings and small juveniles (&lt; 26 mm snout-vent length, SVL; &lt; 14 d old). However, plasma T sharply increased in juvenile males, but not females, after approximately 14 d post-hatch? ing, and it became significantly higher after approximately 38 d post-hatching (&gt; 30 mm SVL). PlasmaT for juvenile males was within the range detected in breeding adult fe? males, but it was 20- to 45-fold lower than that of adult males, breeding or post-breed- ing. Furthermore, eggs that gave rise to males contained nearly twice as much yolk T on the day of oviposition as those that gave rise to females (0.9 vs. 0.5 pg/mg, respec? tively). Behavior trials revealed that, in com? parison to juveniles given empty implants, juvenile males and females given T-implants had increased rates of nearly every behav? ior monitored, approaching those found in breeding adult males. These results dem? onstrate that in spite of sex differences in endogenous T exposure during ontogeny, juveniles of both sexes exhibit an equiva? lent behavioral response to elevated T P3ABLUKER, LA * HATLE, J.D, JUUANO, S.A., Illinois State University The effects of photoperiod on the length of the oviposition cycle of the grasshopper, Romalea microptera. The reproductive tactics of many insects are affected by photoperiod because short- day photoperiods serve as a cue of the on- set of winter. We tested several hypotheses regarding the effects of photoperiod on the length of the ovipositioncycle of the Eastern lubber grasshopper. We predicted that ovi? position would occur sooner in short-day (11.5L:12.5D) animals versus long-day (13.75L:10.25D) animals because the short- day animals would be in a photoperiod as? sociated with the Fail season. We also pre? dicted that costs associated with earlier ovi? position may be expressed as smaller size at the time of oviposition, fewer eggs, or smaller eggs for females on the short-day photoperiod.Two different diets (low and high food quantity) were tested at each photope? riod. The results indicate that the photope? riod did not have a significant effect on the timing of oviposition within either diet treat? ment. Females in the two photoperiod groups did not differ significantly in size at the time of oviposition in either diet treatment. In the high food treatment, there was no signifi? cant difference in the number of eggs be? tween the two photoperiods. However, in the low food treatment, the short-day ani? mals produced significantly fewer eggs than did the long-day animals. This suggests that shorter photoperiod can alter reproductive tactics when food is limited. S5.4 LUTZ, P*, Prentice, H, Florida Atlan? tic University, Boca Raton. Sensing and re? sponding to hypoxia, molecular and physi? ological mechanisms. In order to accommodate to low oxygen it is necessary first to be able to detect hy? poxia, then to initiate the appropriate mecha? nisms. There are two basic detectors: mo? lecular sensors that are directly linked to gene regulation and metabolic indicators that are triggered when the cell goes into a state of energy imbalance. The molecular responses to oxygen deprivation in mam? mals are characterized in a variety of cell types and include activation of oxygen sen? sors, signaling through specific promoter el? ements and subsequent downstream adap? tations. Many of the components are highly conserved across species. A fail in ATP acts as a metabolic indicator of cellular energy crisis. In brain, in particular, there is a re? lease of adenosine which acts to reduce metabolic demand. We are investigating the 1110 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Contribution of the lichen symbiosis to the diversification of fungi: a new approach to determining confidence levels for ancestral character states. The acceptance by the mycological and lichenological communities, more than 12 years ago, that basidiomycetes tightly asso? ciated with green algae or cyanobacteria are lichens, simultaneously established, for the first time, that lichens (including both asco- and basidiolichens) are derived from mul? tiple independent origins. Because approxi? mately one-fifth of all known fungi are lichenized and more than 98% of the diver? sity of lichens is within the ascomycetes, one crucial question remains to be answered: How many independent origins of lichens took place during the evolution of the asco? mycetes? To address this question we have sequenced a 1 kb and a 1.4 kb fragment at the 5' end of the small and large subunits of the nuclear ribosomal DNA, respectively, for 54 species representing 31 orders of asco? mycetes. The combined maximum parsi? mony analysis revealed two equally most parsimonious trees. The ancestral charac? ter states (lichenized versus non-lichenized) were reconstructed for every node using maximum likelihood and by taking into con? sideration phylogenetic uncertainty. The confidence levels for each of the ancestral character states were estimated by recon- structing the evolution of lichenization on a large number of trees randomly sampled within the confidence envelope surround? ing the best trees. 36.2 LYNN, S.E.*, BENOWITZ- FREDERICKS, Z.M., HAYWARD, L.S., WINGFIELD, J.C, University of Washing? ton, Seattle. Testosterone influences male behavior during incubation but not during the parental phase in a temperate passe? rine. Most monogamous male birds exhibit a peak in plasma testosterone (T) in the early spring coincident with territory es? tablishment and pair bonding. Once nests are initiated, T declines precipitously and remains low as nestlings hatch and males become parental. A growing body of evi? dence suggests there is a trade-off be? tween a maleis level of T and expression of paternal care: high T is associated with reduced paternal care in favor of enhanced sexual behavior. Male chestnut-collared longspurs (Calcarius ornatus) show a high degree of paternal care, including feed? ing and brooding young, acting as nest sentries, and aggressively defending the nest against predators. We experimen? tally altered the plasma level of T of male C ornatus such that the early spring T peak was extended through the parental phase. T enhanced song behavior typical of the sexual phase and decreased nest sentry behavior during incubation, but did not interfere with brooding or feeding of nest? lings. Thus, males responded behaviorally to T during incubation, but, unlike most other monogamous birds studied, did not respond to T during the parental phase. Through a series of male removal experi? ments, we determined that male chestnut- collared longspurs are critical for nestling survival.

Data on development of radials and rays of median (dorsal, anal, caudal) and paired (pectoral, pelvic) fins were compared within a phylogenetic framework. We found broadly conserved phylogenetic patterns in directions of development within the differ? ent median and paired fins. Variability within closely related taxa (e.g. Percoidei) demon? strates the evolution of regional specializa? tion and new levels of independence within formerly tightly integrated fin modules. We consider a module to be an element that develops as an independent unit and un? dergoes coordinated changes in evolution. For example, the dorsal and anal fins de? velop in similar ways and undergo coordi? nated changes inevolution, thus may be clas? sified as a module. Previously unrecognized patterns in median fin development contrib? ute to our understanding of fin module de? velopment and evolution, and influence con? struction of genetic models to explain direc? tional phenomena. Based on constraints ob? served within these taxa, models consistent with observed directional patterns were de? veloped. Hox gene activation or repression may account for location of median fins and direction of radial formation within. Or, per? haps in analogy to butterfly wing eyespot development, specific genes are expressed in a pattern of symmetrical nesting, thus pat? terning fin location and development. Mod? ern genetic techniques will permit research? ers to test the models presented here, con- sequently significantly increasing our under? standing of the evolution and development of fin modules.

Animals of a wide range of orders or classes have a portion of their digestive sys- tern adapted to accommodate a fermenta? tion, which assists in digestion as well as providing a varietyof other benefits. Because of the refractory nature of the plant cell wall and the difficulty in digesting it, herbivores have anatomical and physiological adapta? tions of the digestive tract to allow assimila? tion of this material. Herbivorous reptiles, birds, and mammals usually have enlarged or elongated digestive tracts, often includ? ing fermentation chambers or sacs in the foregut and hindgut. Cecum-colon (hindgut) fermentors represent an older differentiation than foregut fermentors which, in turn, are older than ruminants. Advances in our un? derstanding of fermentative digestion have tended to obscure the vital role that the gas? trointestinal microbiota plays in the normal physiological, immunological and protective functions of the host animal. The association of microbes with tissues of the gastrointesti? nal tract of animals during evolution has re? sulted in a balanced relationship between resident microbes and the host. In fact, all animals including humans are adapted to life in a microbial world. Numerous biochemi? cal, physiological and immunological fea? tures that are considered intrinsic charac? teristics of animal species are actually re? sponses by the animal to the physical pres? ence and metabolic activities of the normal indigenous microbiota. This microbial chal? lenge has modified the course of evolution in animals resulting in the selection of ani- mal-microbe relationships which are com? plex and which vary tremendously ranging from competition to cooperation. Its high population density, wide diversity and com? plexity of interactions characterize the gas? trointestinal microbial community. 8.3 MADERSON, PFA.*, ALIBARDI, L, Brooklyn College of C.UN.Y, University of Bologna.

Paleo- ecological analyses suggest that "true" ter? restrial ecosystems only appeared in the L.Trias, a time of major radiations of ad? vanced therapsids. Morphological diversity of CWL barriers in living amniotes suggests independent evolution in different clades. Residing in delicate epidermal tissues, such barriers must be protected from abrasive en? vironmental contact either by tough scales (extant reptiles), or by appendages (hairs or feathers). The demonstration that a simple molecular trigger causes hair follicle multi- plication suggests an explanation for pel? age origin and primary role. Unscaled, early therapsids living in "wet" habitats employed behavioral thermo-regulation as do many anuran amphibians. While some epidermal toughening may have been achieved by in? corporation of histidine-rich proteins into AL- PHA-keratinizing cells, invasion of "dry," po? tentially desiccating, abrasive environments necessitated an appropriately protected CWL barrier. A mutation causing multiplica- tion of protohairs would have provided such protection and would have spread rapidly permitting speciation in the new "terrestrial" environment. The IP of this pilose skin form were a protoadaptation (Gans, 1979) later favored as endothermy emerged. P2.17 MADIGAN, PA, WATERS, K.A, HAR? RIS, LG.*, University ofNew Hampshire. Ju? venile growth variation in the green sea ur? chin, Strongylocentrotus droe-bachiensis: possible roles for larval history, behavior and genetics. Growth of juvenile green sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, has been observed for three year classes, 1998, 1999 and 2000. The urchins from 1998 and 1999 were collected from juvenile settlement panels set out from May to July at the Isles of Shoals off the New Hampshire coast. The urchins used for the 2000 year class growth studies were obtained from laboratory cul? tures originating from adults collected at the Isles of Shoals, so all individuals had a simi? lar larval history and settlement date. Throughout the study, urchins were main? tained under similar culture conditions and fed a combination of microalgal film and fleshy algae. Animals from 1998 and 1999 were measured for test diameter on a monthly basis, while the animals from the 2000 year class have been measured ev? ery two weeks. All three cohorts displayed considerable variation in growth rates un? der similar culture conditions. Larval history and timing of settlement are two possible explanations for growth rate variation in the wild collected 1998 and 1999 year classes. Genetic variation between individuals is also suggested from the similar patterns of growth variation shown by the laboratory reared 2000 year class. Results also indicate that behavior may be important at high densi? ties, which has implications for aquaculture operations. 44.2 MAGLIA, A.*, BUCHHOLZ, D.R., Uni? versity of Kansas, LME/NICHD/NIH.

Although S. couchii and P syriacus are similar in number of ossi? fied elements and amount of ossification at metamorphosis, the time needed to ossify is remarkably different (P. syriacus = 23 days; S. couchii= 9 days). Moreover, S. multiplicata and R ibericus both metamorphose 41 days from hatching and resemble one another in pattern and degree of cranial ossification, but the time to onset of ossification of ele? ments is greater in P ibericus (20 days) than in S. multiplicata (11 days). These and other heterochronic variations in osteogenesis of the four taxa will be discussed within the framework of a phylogenetic hypothesis.

Chemo-tactile predator avoidance responses of the Antarctic limpet, Nacella concinna. The antarctic limpet Nacella concinna has the ability to escape potential predation by the highly mobile and predaceous sea star Neosmilaster georgianus. When the sea star comes into contact with the limpet, the limpet undergoes characteristic avoidance behaviors that include an extension of its pallial tenticles, a rasing of its shell in a mush- room-like fashion, a shell rotation, and flight. These behaviors were not induced by the omnivorous sea star, Odontaster validus which occupies the same habitats as N. georgainus. Crude hydrophilic extracts from N. georgianus also induced the avoidane behaviors, showing that this response is mediated by chemical as well as tactile stimuli. In the field, N. georgianus and O. validus were rarely seen feeding on N. concinna, and there was no difference in the incidence of limpet predation between the two sea stars. The escape behaviors displayed by N. concinna appear to be an effective behavior to deter predation by N georgianus. S13.2 MAIENSCHEIN, J., Arizona State Uni? versity.

Biomechanics of quadrupedal walk? ing: how do four-legged animals walk like inverted pendulums? Walking bipedal and quadrupedal ani? mals conserve mechanical energy by con- verting kinetic energy into gravitational po? tential energy and vice-versa. This inverted pendulum-like exchange is well understood for bipeds in which the center of mass (COM) vaults up and over the stiff support leg. How? ever, walking quadrupeds have 2, 3, and 4 legs in contact with the ground at various times during a stride, making it difficult to understand how the pendulum-like energy exchange occurs. In addition, the typical 25% limb phase (percentage of stride time between successive limb contacts) of walk? ing mammals seems likely to cause the pec? toral and pelvic girdles to oscillate out of phase, thus minimizing the vertical oscilla? tions of the COM. We sought to understand how the limbs of quadrupeds function to al? low the COM to move like an inverted pen- dulum. We collected ground reaction forces and video of 6 dogs walking at a range of speeds. We integrated the forces to deter? mine the velocity and vertical displacement of the COM, which were used to calculate 1114 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Dogs saved up to 70% of the mechanical work required to lift and accelerate the COM via the inverted pendulum mechanism. Two factors were primarily responsible for this in? verted pendulum-like movement. First, the forelimbs supported the majority of body weight (63%). Consequently, the COM move? ments followed the forelimb movements, mimicking a walking biped. Second, dogs walked with a relatively short time between their ipsilateral hindlimb and forelimb ground contacts (limb phase = 15%), perhaps pre? venting the pectoral and pelvic girdles from moving out of phase with each other.

Neurodegen-eration and amyloidosis in the brain of kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka kenneriyi) during sexual maturation and senescence. The brain of senescent kokanee salmon exhibits neuropathology similar to that of aging humans (Maldonado et al., Brain Research. 858, 237-251, 2000). Beta-amyloid (ABETA) is distributed re- gionally in the salmon brain and its extra? cellular presence correlates with senes? cence. Brains of kokanee from one of four reproductive stages (immature, maturing, mature and spawning) were stained with cresyl violet to visualize pyknotic neurons (neurodegeneration) in 24 specific regions of the brain. Brains of immature and ma? turing fish exhibited only low levels of neurodegen-eration compared to sexually mature and spawning fish. Greatest neurodegeneration occurred in regions immunopositive for ABETA including those involved in gustation, olfaction, vision the stress response, reproductive behavior and coordination as well as in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and inferior lobe of the hypothalamus. Five regions showed neurodegeneration with no amyloidosis (ABETA deposition) whereas the nucleus lateralis tuberis and the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum showed neither neurodegeneration nor amyloidosis. In most regions, increased neuro-degenera- tion preceded ABETA deposition while in some regions it could not be determined which appeared first. 14.2 MANZON, L.A.*, LAUDET, V, YOUSON, J.H, University of Toronto at Scarborough, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon et CNRS, France, University of Toronto at Scarborough. Cloning and expression of sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) thyroid hormone and retinoid X receptors. Sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) are extant representatives of an ancient group of vertebrates with a history that can be traced over 500 million years. A dramatic decline in serum thyroid hormones (TH) oc? curs at the onset of lamprey metamorpho? sis, but the significance of this decline to the initiation and progression of metamorpho? sis remains to be elucidated. Since, in most other vertebrates, the effects of TH are gen? erally mediated by interactions with a thy? roid hormone receptor (TR) - retinoid X re? ceptor (RXR) heterodimer, we cloned the cDNAs for these receptors and examined their expression over the lamprey life cycle. RT-PCR and 5' and 3' RACE yielded full- length cDNAs for two thyroid hormone re? ceptors (TR1 and TR2) and one retinoid X receptor (RXR).The deduced amino acid se? quences of these lamprey receptors were approximately 85-88% similar to those of other vertebrates. Northern blotting using RNA from several larval and adult tissues indicated that the expression of TR1, but not TR2, is tissue- and stage-specific. Similar TR expression patterns are also observed in other metamorphosing vertebrates. Our lamprey RXR contains a deletion in the hinge and ligand-binding domains of the receptor, but its expression patterns have not yet been determined. The results of these cloning and expression studies indicate that the se? quence, and perhaps the function, of these receptors has been conserved during ver? tebrate evolution. Furthermore, knowledge of the expression of these receptors aids our understanding of the role of TH in lamprey metamorphosis and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in this developmental event.

In vitro inhibi? tion of thyroidal activity in the larval lamprey endostyle by potassium perchlorate. The larval lamprey is unique among ver? tebrates because it lacks a follicular thyroid gland. In larval lampreys, thyroid hormones are produced in the endostyle, a subpharyngeal gland. Moreover, contrary to the amphibian paradigm, lamprey meta? morphosis coincides with a decline in se? rum thyroid hormone (TH) titers and goitro- gens (anti-thyroid agents), which depress TH titers, can induce precocious metamor? phosis in lampreys. In this study, an in vitro experimental system was devised to assess the direct effects of the goitrogen potassium perchlorate (KCI04) on radioiodide uptake and organification by the larval lamprey en? dostyle. Organification refers to the incorpo? ration of iodide into lamprey thyroglobulin (Tg), an essential step in TH synthesis. A single iodoprotein, designated as lamprey Tg, was identified in the endostylar homogenates with polyacrylamide gel elec? trophoresis followed by autoradiography and Western blotting. Lamprey Tg was im? munoreactive with a rabbit anti-human Tg antibody and had an electrophoretic mobil? ity similar to porcine Tg. When KCI04 was added to the incubation medium, both io? dide uptake and organification by the endo? style were inhibited, as determined by gamma counting and gel-autoradiography, respectively. Western blotting showed that KCI04 lowered the total amount of lamprey Tg in the endostyle. Based on the results of this in vitro investigation, we conclude that KCI04 acts directly on the larval lamprey en? dostyle to inhibit thyroidal activity, thus sup? pressing the synthesis of thyroxine and tri- iodothyronine and resulting in a decrease in the serum levels of these two hormones.

Parental choice of early offspring envi? ronments can have important fitness conse- quences for their young, especially in taxa with otherwise limited parental investment. The pathways by which site variables influ? ence fitness will determine the strength of selection for site choice. In 1995 and 1996, I investigated the direct and indirect effects of rearing site choice in Dendrobates pumilio, a frog with extended parental care. Female D. pumilio deposit their tadpoles in Dieffenbachia and bromeliad axils that vary in age, water volume, pH, mean tempera? ture, and temperature variance. The results of this study indicate that female D. pumilio actively diseriminate among abundantly available rearing sites when depositing their tadpoles and that these site choices may have both direct and indirect consequences for tadpole survival. Females consistently chose younger rearing sites with greater water volumes in both years, and selected on mean temperature in 1995. Although the fitness consequences of water volume and axil age could not be assessed in this study, these axil characters are expected to have direct effects on offspring survival. Variance in axil temperature had an indirect effect on tadpole fitness via its effect on tadpole growth in 1996; however, females showed no pref? erence for temperature variance when de? positing their tadpoles. These results are consistent with the prediction that mothers showing extended parental care will more likely diseriminate among sites (if they dis? eriminate at all) based on characters having direct effects on offspring survival than among sites based on characters with only indirect effects.

During meta? morphosis, the spinal cord develops the cir? cuitry to control arm and leg movement. The interference of thyroid hormone action in the spinal cord by means of nervous system specific transgenes leads to the develop? ment of limbs that look normal but that in severe cases lack any motion and in less severe cases have uncoordinated move? ment. Examination of these paralyzed limbs show abnormal development of the neuro? muscular junction. Also during metamorpho? sis, the eyes shift their position and for the first time develop a region of visual overlap. Concurrent with these eye position changes, the retinas alter their proliferation pattern from symmetric to asymmetric and for the first time develop an axonal projection to the same side of the brain. Transgenic interference of the action of the action of thyroid hormone in the retina leads to inhibition of both these changes. Further, transgenic studies also demonstrate that the localized expression of a thyroid hormone degrading enzyme in the dorsal margin of the retina is sufficient to account for the asymmetry that develops in the retina at metamorphosis.

The lips and cheeks of mammals form a complex structure of constant volume that appears to function as a muscular hydrostat. The muscles involved, primarily orbicularis oris and buccinator, are part of the facial mus? culature innervated by CN VII. Their fine motor control is likely accompanied by spe? cialized innervation. The degree of perioral muscle elaboration is related to food acqui? sition and processing. For example, the lips of herbivores (e.g., guinea pigs) are well de? veloped and complex compared to carni? vores (e.g., felids). The size and organiza? tion of the facial nucleus may reflect the be? havioral use of perioral muscles. The lips and cheeks of pigs provide an intermediate model of a mammalian muscular hydrostat in which the innervation can be investigated. We conducted a retrograde nerve tracing study of CN VII in pigs to determine (1) the location and morphology of the facial motor nucleus, (2) the location of motor neuron pools that innervate perioral muscles, and (3) the organization of these motor pools. Lips and cheeks were injected with fluores? cent neurotracers. Subjects survived for 7 days to allow retrograde transport of tracers. The pig facial nucleus is located in the ven? tral pontine tegmentum and is comprised of 7 subnuclei. Perioral muscle motor neuron pools are found in 3 of the 7 subnuclei and, in general, are segregated from motor neu? rons innervating other facial muscles. These motor pools are organized somatotopieally; neurons within the lateral, ventral lateral, and ventral intermediate subnuclei innervate the superior orbicularis oris, inferior orbicularis oris, and buccinator muscles respectively. The size and organization of the pig facial nucleus lie between those of guinea pigs and cats. S12.3 MARTIN, J.E., University of B.C. Ad? vances through the insect hindgut. How are insects able to maintain internal osmotic and ionic balance in the face of en? vironmental challenges? Since early stud? ies by Phillips which established desert lo? custs actively conserve water and produce a hyperosmotic excreta, the question of how homeostasis is achieved has been the cen? tral focus of his work. Utilizing isolated prepa? rations of hindgut segments, Johnws labo? ratory has developed a detailed model of hindgut function and regulation. The ante? rior segment (ileum)reabsorbs the bulk of entering fluid and delivers an isosmotic fluid to the rectum. Local osmosis and ion recy- cling allow the rectum to elaborate a hyposmotic absorbate and produce strongly hyperosmotic excreta. 90% of water is re? cycled due in part to lateral membrane/mito- chondrial complexes present in the rectum. Metabolic support of transport is provided by luminal amino acids. Numerous solute transporters have been characterized and localized in the hindgut and there is evidence that many are hormonally regulated. Vari? ous tissue homogenates stimulate ion trans? port and are antidiuretic factors. One factor, ion transport peptide (ITP) has been puri- 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

A par? tial cDNA corresponding to this sequence was amplified and extended by polymerase chain reaction to give a complete cDNA which predicted a 72 amino acid peptide with 3 disufide bridges and an amidated C terminus. Synthesis of the predicted pep? tide resulted in a peptide whose biological activity was identical to that of ITP purified from CC. Expression of ITP and mutant ITP peptides in a Drosphila cell line indicate residues important for binding and signal transduction. There is now evidence for pep? tides structurally related to ITP in Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera as well as Ortho? ptera and it will be very exciting to deter? mine their functions in whole animals. 35.5 MARTINEZDEL RIO, C*, SABAT, P, SCHONDUBE, J. E, University ofWyoming, University de Chile, University of Arizona. Stable isotope composition as a covariate in comparative physiology. When animals ingest different diets, they must process contrasting arrays of nutrients, electrolytes, toxins and water. Hence, diet is a major determinant of an animal's diges? tive and osmoregulatory traits and an im? portant independent variable in compara? tive studies. Characterizing diets, however, can be difficult. We propose the use of the stable isotopic composition of an animal's tissues as an indicator of its diet. We hypoth? esized that stable isotopic composition can be used as a covariate in comparative stud? ies and used two systems to examine this conjecture: phyllostomid bats and passerine birds in the genus Cinclodes (Fumariidae). We used DELTA15N as a proxy variable for protein ingestion in phyllostomid bats. Nectarivorous and frugivorous species were characterized by low values of DELTA15N, whereas insectivorous, sanguinivorous, and carnivorous species were characterized by high values. The kidney's concentrating ca? pacity increased with DELTA15N. In contrast, the capacity of the gut to process sugars decreased with DELTA15N. The genus Cinclodes is unique among passerines in that it includes species that live in hyperarid environments and feed on maritime envi- ronments. It also includes species that live and feed on terrestrial and fresh-water habi? tats. DELTA13C characterized the marine and terrestrial/f resh water diet of these birds, and hence the salt loads that they ingested. Kidney mass and relative medulary thick? ness, as well as the osmotic concentration of urine and excreta, were positively corre? lated with DELTA13C within and among spe? cies. Our two examples highlight the poten? tial value of stable isotope composition data for comparative analyses.

Osmotic and ionic regu? lation in the hydrothermal vent crab Bythograea thermydron. This study investigates the salinity tol? erance and the ability to osmoregulate and ionoregulate of a brachyuran crab en? demic to the deep sea hydrothermal vent habitat, Bythograea thermydron. Crabs were collected during the HOPE 99 mis- sion from hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise (EPR) on the 13/N and 9/N sites, at a depth of approximately 2500 m. Salinities of 32-34 ppt were measured in the seawater surrounding the captured specimens. We found that this species is a marine stenohaline osmoconformer with tolerable salinities ranging between ap? proximately 31 and 41 ppt. The time of os? motic adaptation after a sudden decrease in external salinity was approximately 15- 24h, which is particularly short for an adult brachyuran crab. In the range of tolerable salinities, it exhibited an iso-osmotic regu? lation, which was not affected by changes in hydrostatic pressure, and an iso-ionic regulation for Na and CI. The hemolymph Ca concentration was slightly hyper-regu- lated, K concentration was slightly hyper- hypo-regulated and Mg concentration was strongly hypo-regulated. These findings probably reflect a high permeability of the teguments of these crabs to water and ions. In addition, the presence of ionocytes was 1118 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

No histological difference was noted between anterior and posterior gills. These results lead to the hypothesis that B. thermydron, as a stenohaline osmoconformer, lives in a habitat of stable seawater salinity. 64.6 MARTINEZG.M, University of New Hampshire. Muscle development in the long- finned squid using phalloidin staining meth? ods. Whole mounts and serial sections of embryonic and paralarval Loligo peaii squids were prepared and stained with phalloidinrirhodamine flourescent stain which binds to F-actin filaments. Staining revealed a network of actin filaments at dif? ferent densities at different stages. Muscles of the mantle, arms, tentacles and buccal mass were traced from Stage 17 to post hatching (staging according to Arnold, 1965). Particularly striking was the formation of the chromatophore musculature system, which appears as a circular array around individual chromatophores. Extensive work on the func? tional morphology of cephalopod muscles has been carried out by Kier et al., although the actual ontogeny of major muscle sys? tems has not been followed. I here present a new method for investigating muscle devel? opment. This technique will also be useful for comparative studies, and in providing phylogenetically useful characters. 7.3 MASLAKOVA, S.

Remains of the pilidium in direct developing nemerteans? Nemertean worms display two basic types of development: direct and indirect. A specialized planktonic larva, the pilidium, characterizes the order HeteronemerteaThe juvenile worm develops via a unique form of imaginal discs and sheds most of the larval body during radical metamorphosis. An en? capsulated larva, homologous to the pilidium, is found in some heteronemertean species; in this case, metamorphosis takes place within the egg envelope. Species of two other major nemertean groups - the orders Palaeo - and Hoplonemertea have long been con? sidered to have direct development, al? though a few literature sources point to the presence of larval epidermis, replaced by the definitive epidermis during an encapsu? lated development in several species. Whether a direct or an indirect type of devel? opment is ancestral is a key question in stud? ies of evolution of the phylum. If this lost lar? val epidermis among palaeo- and hoplonemerteans can be shown to be ho? mologous to that of the pilidium larva, and therefore plesiomorphic for the phylum, this would challenge the current, implicit view that direct development is primitive for Nemertea. Here we present the first photo? graphs of the larval ectoderm of a hoplonemertean, as well as additional data on the distribution of the larval ectoderm among hoplonemertean species. Our recent cell-lineage studies provide some evidence that larval ectoderm of hoplonemerteans originates (at least in part) from the cells of the first quartet of micromeres. This supports the hypothesis that the larval ectoderm of hoplonemerteans is homologous to the lar? val body of the heteronemerteans, as the first quartet of micromeres produces most of the pilidial body. 51.3 MATHEWS, LM, University of Louisi? ana, Lafayette. Evolution of social mo? nogamy in snapping shrimp. Social monogamy in the absence of bi- parental care is a topic of interest, as it is predicted to be rare by parental investment theory, yet it occurs in a broad range of taxa. Most or all caridean shrimp of the genus Alpheus occur in heterosexual pairs, a so? cial organization that may have evolved as a form of extended mate guarding of females or territorial cooperation between partners. The mate-guarding hypothesis predicts that males should be able to detect female sexual receptivity, and should prefer to associate with females closer to receptivity. An experi? ment to test for distance communication of gender and sexual status revealed that male 800-955-1236 ? (703)790-1745 ?

A mate-choice ex? periment showed that this is translated into active mate-choice decisions: males paired with premolt females significantly more than with intermolt females. The territorial coop- eration hypothesis predicts that individuals in pairs benefit through shared territorial defense, by having a significantly lower risk of eviction from the burrow when faced with an intruder. Laboratory experiments showed that females in pairs are less likely to be evicted than solitary females (p=0.034), but there was no difference in the eviction rates for paired and solitary males. Furthermore, males were significantly more likely to aban- don the burrow if their mates were low-value (far from receptivity) than if their mates were high-value (p=0.004). These data together suggest that male and female A. angulatus are under different selective pressures lead? ing to social monogamy: males engage in extended mate-guarding, which is tolerated by females because of the advantages of shared territorial defense. 16.3 MAURES, T.*, DUAN, C University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 in zebrafish. Regulation of growth factor and hormone action by soluble hormone binding proteins has emerged as a common theme for a va? riety of peptides including insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). Among the best studied hor? mone binding proteins are members of the IGF binding protein (IGFBP) gene family. Six distinct high-affinity IGFBPs have been iden? tified and cloned. Each of these IGFBPs rep? resents an individual gene product, and is regulated differentially. The differential tissue distribution and regulation patterns support the hypothesis that each IGFBP may have a unique function. The exact role of each IGFBP in vivo, however, is poorly understood. This lack of knowledge is particularly evi? dent in the embryonic stage. Research in this area has heavily relied on rodent mod? els, and attempts have been hampered by the inaccessibility of the mammalian fetus enclosed in the uterus. Our laboratory has been addressing this problem utilizing a te? leost model, the zebrafish. The free-living, transparent and fast-developing zebrafish embryos and the availability of numerous genetic mutants make them a particularly suitable model system. In this paper, we re? port the cloning and characterization of an IGFBP in zebrafish. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis results indicated that this protein is closely related to IGFBP- 1. Its sequence identity to human IGFBP-1 is 37%. RT-PCR analysis indicated that IGFBP-1 mRNA is expressed in zebrafish embryos and adult tissues and its expres? sion is tissue-specific. Currently experiments are undergoing to determine the spatial and temporal expression of IGFBP-1 in all em? bryonic stages at single cell resolution.

Sexual dimorphism in gonadal ste? roidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) expression dur? ing sexual differentiation and the effects of octylphenol on the differentiation process in the American bullfrog Rana catesbeiana. Gonadal steroidogenesis during devel? opment is critical to differentiation of the adult sexually dimorphic phenotype and repro? ductive function. Environmental contami? nants may play a role in affecting the pro? cess of sexual differentiation through dis? ruption of steroidogenic action. Control of the steroidogenic pathway is regulated, in part, by P450 cytochrome hydroxylases, and the expression of many of these enzymes is controlled by the orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1). In mammals, SF-1 expression is critical for development of the reproductive axis and adult reproduc? tive function. In Rana catesbeiana during sequential stages of development, we de? termined that SF-1 protein expression be? comes elevated in ovaries of sexually dif- ferentiating females, while expression in tes? tes decreases as differentiation occurs. Next, we exposed animals to the industrial pollutant, octylphenol (OP), for 24 hours before and during the critical stages of sexual 1120 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="197">differentiation. We found that animals treated with OP prior to the normal time of differen? tiation underwent early gonadal differentia? tion and those that differentiated into females had elevated SF-1 expression. This is the first study to investigate changes in SF-1 during development at the protein level. Our results suggest that 1) SF-1 expression dif? fers between males and females during sexual differentiation in a pattern similar to chickens and alligators, but different from mammals and turtles, and 2) OP affects the timing of differentiation in bullfrogs demon- strating that OP has effects on developmen? tal processes.

We have conducted an artificial selec? tion experiment in which 4 replicate lines of house mice were bred for high wheel run? ning and 4 non-selected lines were main? tained as controls. At generation 24, mice from selected lines were running approxi? mately 2.77-times as many revolutions per day as individuals from random-bred con? trol lines. As compared with the randombred control lines, our selected lines of mice may run more on wheels because they have (1) higher motivation to run but similar physi? ological capacities for wheel running; (2) similar motivation but higher physiological capacities; (3) both higher motivation and higher physiological capacities. Research to date has detected some differences in morphological and physiological traits that may support wheel running, including re? duced body mass, more symmetrical hindlimb lengths, and enhanced capacity for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in hindlimb muscles. To measure motivation, we followed R. C. Bolles' definition of moti? vation as a cognitive state for which multiple measures can be used to assess its level. The most appropriate measure may depend on the specific question, and it is likely that no single measure can adequately capture differences in motivation. Hence, we used several ways to increase the difficulty of wheel running, and analyzed the propor? tional reduction in wheel running.Treatments included greater rotational resistance, 1 or 2 hurdles placed in wheels, and insertion of a tube between wheel and home cage. Dur? ing treatments with either 1 or 2 hurdles, the proportional decrease in total number of wheel revolutions, the number of intervals spent running, and the maximum number of revolutions during any 1-min interval were all significantly less for selected-line animals.

The variation in feeding behavior of scleroglossan and autarchoglossan liz? ards One of the primary goals of functional morphology is the quantification of behav? ior in relation to morphological variation. The two major clades of lizards, scleroglossa and autarchoglossa, show substantial variation in cranial morphol? ogy, hyoid apparatus, tongue musculature, and the functional morphology of lizard feeding. However, our understanding of the behavioral variation present in lizard feed? ing is limited and no work to date has ad- equately described the range of behav? iors lizards use to ingest and process prey. The goal of this study is to describe and quantify the behavioral repertoire lizards use while feeding. Feeding bouts were vid- eotaped in a phylogenetically diverse sample of lizard taxa and behavioral cat? egories were delineated. Five distinct types of prey processing behavior were de? scribed (transport, inertial transport, side- to side movement, puncture crushing, and "palatal crushing"). All taxa engaged in prey transport behaviors. However, the fre? quencies of the five behaviors differed between scleroglossan and autarcho? glossan lizards. Per feeding bout, autarchoglossans consistently engaged in more puncture crushing, transport, and total number of feeding behaviors. Also, autarchoglossans showed an increased tendency to intersperse behaviors during a feeding bout. Interestingly, all lizards exhibited a previously undescribed behav? ior that we are calling "palatal crushing". 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Cranial neural crest cell migration in the lamprey Petromyzon marinus. The neural crest is a vertebrate-specific population of cells that gives rise to much of the peripheral nervous system, pigment cells, and many craniofacial derivatives in? cluding facial bones, cartilage, teeth, and cranial ganglia. We have begun to investi? gate the origin of these cells in the lamprey, the most basal extant vertebrate. Here we describe the migration of cranial neural crest cells into the pharyngeal arches by using a cell lineage tracer, Dil. Small regions of cells along the dorsal midline were labeled with Dil at the time of neural crest cell migration. Embryos were allowed to develop and were then fixed at various intervals following mi? gration. We show that cranial neural crest migratory pathways do not differ apprecia- bly from those previously demonstrated in more derived vertebrates, such as the frog, even though the lamprey lacks such neural crest derivatives as jaws and true teeth. In- terestingly, although cells were labeled pos? terior to the hindbrain, no migratory crest cells were seen in this region. This observa? tion may relate to the lack of sympathetic chain ganglia, another neural crest deriva- tive not found in the lamprey. These studies will be used to correlate the expression of known neural crest markers with migratory pathways to begin to understand the level of conservation of neural crest developmental mechanisms between basal and derived vertebrates. P2.76A MCCAY, M. G., University of Cali? fornia, Berkeley. The effects of aerodynamic stability on the dynamics of tree frog gliding. Gliding has originated independently in at least two tree frog families, including the genus Agalychnis (family Hylidae). Gliding tree frogs of both families possess features such as enlarged, extensively webbed hands and feet and a unique gliding pos? ture. In a previous study, the aerodynamic stability of both derived gliding frogs and primitive non-gliding frogs in the genus Agalychnis were very low overall and did not correlate with any aspect of morphology. A possible explanation for the low stability for all Agalychnis regardless of gliding abil? ity was that the low stability enhances the frog's maneuverability throughout the Agalychnis lineage. I investigated the ef? fects of aerodynamic stability on tree frog maneuverability using a six-degree-of-free- dom computational model. This model ac- counted for the effects of the frog's mass, morphology, and aerodynamic stability. In addition, the effects of wind gusts calculated from wind gusts measured in the field were also incorporated into the computational model. The model demonstrates oscillations while gliding (Dutch roll) which have been observed in actual gliding tree frogs, and glide angles and glide speeds similar to those observed from measurements of ac? tual gliding tree frogs. Higher body mass tends to reduce maneuverability for a given morphology. I compared the maneuverabil? ity of a non-gliding tree frog and a gliding tree frog, and found that the reduced respon? siveness to maneuvering postures of the non-gliding tree frog is ameliorated by its lower body mass compared to the more massive gliding tree frog. Increasing (mak? ing more stable) or decreasing (making less stable) the aerodynamic stability reduces the initial response of a tree frog to a maneuver? ing posture, but does not change the overall maximum turn rate.

Ontogeny of UDP-GT activity in Japanese quail and ef? fects of PCB 126 on UDP-GT activity in chicken embryos. Uridinediphosphate-glucurono- syltransferases (UDP-GTs) are important phase II liver biotransformation enzymes re? sponsible for conjugation of many endog? enous and exogenous substances in verte? brates. Induction of UDP-GTs has been shown in birds exposed to pollutant chemi? cals such as PCBs and TCDD. Because UDP-GTs are responsible for the removal of thyroxine from the circulation, their induc? tion can cause a concomitant decrease in circulating thyroid hormones (THs). To in? vestigate the development of UDP-GT activ? ity in precocial bird embryos, we examined the pattern of enzyme activity during differ? ent stages of embryonic (d12,14,16 and 17 of incubation) and post-hatch (d&lt;1,1 and 7) development in Japanese quail. To eluci- date the effects of pollutant chemicals on UDP-GT induction in developing bird em? bryos, we dosed chicken eggs with the co? planar PCB 126 (0, .0512 to .80 ng/g egg) and sampled on d20 of the 21 day incuba? tion period. We validated a colorimetric as? say for UDP-GT activity in quail and chicken liver homogenate with Para-nitrophenol as substrate. Plasma THs were determined by RIA. The development of quail UDP-GT ac? tivity shows low, stable activity pre-hatch, in? creasing activity during the peri-hatch pe- riod and further increases in activity from d1 to 7 post-hatch. In PCB-dosed chickens, there were no significant differences from controls in UDP-GT activity, plasma thyrox? ine, thyroid gland weights or thyroid gland THs. Thus, embryonic exposure to PCB 126 did not cause thyroid disruption at sub-le? thal concentrations. However, additional congeners and PCB mixtures need to be evaluated for their effects on thyroid func? tion.

Hox gene pat? terning and fish evolution. We are using the zebrafish to investi? gate the evolution of Hox gene patterning functions. Whereas tetrapods possess 4 clusters of Hox genes, zebrafish have 7 distinct clusters. This condition is most likely due to a whole genome duplication, which occurred either early in or prior to the radiation of teleost fish. Zebrafish have at least 47 Hox genes, compared with 39 in mouse and human. Why have these "ex? tra" Hox genes been maintained in the zebrafish? To address this question, we have undertaken an analysis of the zebrafish homologues of Drosophila Labial,Xhe members of paralogue group 1 (PG1). Zebrafish have four PG1 genes, whereas mouse and human have three. We find that two of the zebrafish PG1 genes share an expression domain in the ventral midbrain, well anterior to the re? gion that vertebrate Hox genes are thought to pattern based on both expression and functional data. Our data suggest that this patterning role may be an ancestral fea? ture within the vertebrates which has been secondarily lost in mammals. We have used mis-expression to directly examine the function of the four zebrafish PG1 genes. We find that ectopic expression of 3 of the 4 PG1 proteins leads to a homeotic transformation in the hindbrain such that rhombomere 2 (r2) takes on characteris? tics of r4, as assayed by anatomical and molecular markers. Thus, we find evidence for evolution of PG1 genes at both cis- 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ? Fax: (703) 790-2672 ? www.SICB.org 1123</page><page sequence="200">regulatory and protein-coding levels.

Diversity and evolution of larval patterns in ophiuroid echinoderms. Ophiuroids have three larval types: ophiopluteus, vitellaria, and doliolaria, as well as direct developing mesogens. There are four developmental patterns: planktotrophy, pelagic lecithotrophy, benthic lecithotrophy, and direct development. Lecithotrophic development is phylogeneti? cally widespread and occurs in more fami? lies (10 of 11) than does planktotrophy via an ophiopluteus (5 of 10 families). In most species with planktotrophic development, the pluteus is the final larval stage, but in one species, Ophiocoma pumila, the ophiopluteus transforms into a pelagic, nonfeeding doliolaria at the onset of meta? morphosis. Pelagic lecithotrophic develop? ment occurs via a reduced pluteus or a doliolaria larva. Benthic development in? volves a reduced pluteus that metamorpho- ses before hatching, or a brooded vitellaria or mesogen. The ancestral ophiuroid life cycle probably involved planktotrophic de? velopment via an ophiopluteus larva, fol? lowed by a pelagic, lecithotrophic doliolaria larva. Assuming that the loss of a feeding larval stage is irreversible, then nonfeeding larval development must have evolved at least 10 times. Benthic development must have evolved at least 9 times. Direct devel? opment has evolved at least twice in the class. The doliolaria stage has been lost at least 3 times, and the pluteus has been lost a minimum of 9 times. There is a confusing array of possible evolutionary transitions that could account for the diverse derived life cycles and larval stages of ophiuroids. Sev? eral developmental patterns could have evolved by alternative routes and if evolved repeatedly, by multiple routes. Unfortunately, the developmental diversity of the ophiuroids is too poorly known to confirm or eliminate most of these possibilities. 5.1 MCFADDEN, CS.*, TULLIS, /., HUTCHINSON, M.B., WINNER, K, Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA. Rates of evo? lution of cnidarian mitochondrial genes. Molecular phylogenetic and phylogeo? graphic studies of cnidarians have been hampered by the apparently slow rate of mi? tochondrial gene evolution in this group. Genes such as COI, routinely used for popu? lation-level studies of other invertebrates, are often virtually invariant among conge- neric species of cnidarians. Nuclear rDNA sequences such as ITS, on the other hand, often evolve too rapidly to resolve the rela? tionships of congeners. We have developed PCR primers to amplify several regions of the soft coral mitochondrial genome (includ? ing ND2, ND6 and control regions) that may provide more phylogenetic resolution among species and genera than either ITS or COI. We have used these three mtDNA sequences to reconstruct the phylogeny of several genera in the soft coral family Alcyoniidae, and compare the rates of evo? lution and number of parsimony-informative characters in each region relative to COI and ITS. 13.1 MCGINN, N.A. *, WALKER, C W, Uni? versity of New Hampshire.

It is therefore imperative that we un? derstand the general and reproductive biol? ogy of this species. In particular, vitellogen? esis is a process in sea urchins on which little basic research has been done. Vitello? genesis is vital to successful reproduction and the vitellogenin protein may influence the palatability of sea urchin roe.

Novel observations include the labeling of mature sperm and connective tissue cells associ? ated with the outer gonadal wall by a vitellogenin antibody. This study and future work on vitellogenesis in commercial sea urchin species will be important as natural stocks continue to decline and interest in aquaculture increases. 7.2 MCGOVERN, TM, Florida St. Univer? sity Sex ratio bias in the clonal brittle star Ophiactis savignyi. Despite the prevalence of clonal organ? isms in many communities, few investiga? tors have explicitly related clonal and sexual modes of reproduction. Clonal reproduction is likely to affect sexual reproduction in a variety of ways, including the alteration of operational sex ratios. Sex ratios in natural populations of the clonal brittle star Ophiactis savignyi are consistently and significantly male-biased. To explore the impact of clonal reproduction on sex ratios in this species, I examined patterns of clonal structure and conducted field experiments to determine gender-specific rates of clonal reproduction. Using RAPD patterns to demarcate clones, I have shown that male clones typically had more clonemates than female clones. The greater number of individuals in male clones can explain the bias toward male individu? als in natural populations. In a field experi? ment in which I followed the fates of indi? viduals of known gender, I demonstrated that males are more likely to divide than females. This bias in division rates is likely respon? sible for the greater number of clonemates in male clones. Differences between the genders in allocation to sexual reproduc? tion and the cost to sexual reproduction as? sociated with cloning may underlie the dif? ferences in rates of clonal division. These findings demonstrate that differences be? tween the genders in rates of clonal division and the subsequent effects on clonal struc? ture have the potential to influence sexual reproduction on a population level by gen- erating a bias in the operational sex ratio. 41.5 MCGOWAN, CP*, O'REILLY, J.C., NISHIKAWA, KC, Northern Arizona Univer? sity, Flagstaff, AZ. Scaling of the feeding mechanism in the Colorado River toad. There are several potential structural and functional consequences of an animal changing size. As the whole animal grows, individual components that make up com? plex functional systems, such as the feeding mechanism, may grow at varying rates. To explore this issue, we examined the feeding system of the Colorado River Toad, Bufo alvarius, modeled as a simple mechanical lever system. We evaluated several aspects of the feeding mechanism, including skull measurements, linear jaw measurements, mechanical advantage of jaw opening and closing, jaw opening and closing muscula? ture and in vivo bite forces. Components of the feeding system were scaled against body length in order to test for isometry and establish relative growth rates. The sample size included 30 animals ranging from 15 to 130 mm in body length as well as a sepa? rate group of 12 live toads in this size range, which were used to acquire bite forces. The results of the changing skull and jaw mor? phology were related to existing feeding ki? nematics for Bufo alvarius of a similar size range. Mechanical advantage remained constant for both jaw opening and closing, though the lever arms measured to deter? mine mechanical advantage were not iso? metric with respect to body size. The pre? dicted jaw Closing force was very similar to that observed in vivo, but also did not scale isometrically with size. The results ofthe pre? dicted jaw Opening forces however did not match that observed through kinematics, suggesting that some other component not explored in this study is active in the ballistic tongue protraction mechanism of this spe? cies.

This is certainly the case for undulatory swimmers operat? ing at intermediate Reynolds numbers (Re), where both inertial and viscous forces are important. In the present study, propulsive forces were measured in both tethered and freely swimming ascidian 'tadpole' larvae (Botrylloides sp.), which swim at Re-100. These 2mm long larvae were tethered to mi- cro-capillary tubes with light suction. By mea? suring the stiffness of this tether, the total force generated by the larval body was calculated from tether deflection measurements. Forces measured in tethered larvae were greatest in the lateral direction and were found to vary between 1 and 40 MU N among indi? viduals. These measurements were com? pared to theoretical predictions for lateral forces by applying blade element methods to the axial kinematics of the tail. Predicted forces were also compared to the centrip? etal forces generated by freely swimming larvae recorded in three dimensions with high-speed video. These measurements will provide the basis for a more comprehen? sive treatment of the dynamics of helical swim? ming in larvae of ascidians and other ma? rine invertebrates.

Male A. polyphemus use pheromones in order to locate females. The male detects the pheromones after it moves through the antennae. The antennae of the male are large and very plumose, and therefore have a significant boundary layer. The purpose of this study is to find out how the boundary layer influences the movement of chemical signals to the receptors. The chemical sig? nal was measured using IVEC10. In the first part of the study the angle at which the an? tennae faced into flow was manipulated, and in the second part we moved the electrode in a transverse fashion. Several parameters important for the detection of chemical sig? nals were analyzed, these included peak length, peak rise time, maximum height, and decay slope. The results show that the pres? ence of the antennae, the angle, and of the position on the antennae impacts chemical signals parameters and t hus the informa? tion that male moths can extract from odor signals. 14.5 McNABB, F.M.A.*, FOWLER, L.A., PARSONS, CM, GRASMAN, K.A., FOX, G.A., Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Wright State University, Dayton, Canadian Wildlife Service, Environment Canada, Hul. Thyroid function in herring gulls from PCB- contaminated Great Lakes sites. We have investigated thyroid function in pipped embryos and prefledglings of her? ring gulls sampled in 1998 and 1999 at sev? eral Great Lakes sites with different amounts of PCB contamination and have compared them with gulls from the reference site, Kent Island in the Bay of Fundy. Previous studies found alterations in thyroid gland histology and size in gulls from PCB-polluted Great Lakes sites, suggesting thyroid disruption in these birds. Gulls collected in 1992 had de? creased organ masses (liver, kidney, spleen, adrenals) and thyroid gland hypertrophy correlated with the sum of PCBs in pooled egg homogenates from different sites. In 1998 and 1999, there was no consistent pattern of differences in plasma thyroid hor? mones (THs) or T4 to T3 conversion in brain of either embryos or prefledglings across sites. However, thyroid glands tended to be larger in embryos and were significantly hy- pertrophied in prefledglings from the high PCB sites compared to the reference site. Weight-specific thyroid gland TH content was significantly decreased in both embryos and prefledglings at high PCB sites in both 1998 and 1999. Thus, despite thyroid gland depletion of stored THs with high PCB expo? sure, developing herring gulls are able to maintain their circulating THs at concentra? tions comparable to those in gulls from the reference site.

When habitat quality on the breeding grounds is poor, arctic-nesting geese must eat foods of lower quality than their preferred foods. We tested the hypothesis that when geese eat foods of lower quality (i.e., higher fiber), (a) they eat more, (b) their digesta re? tention time and digestive efficiency does not change, (c) their total capacity for break? down and absorption of nutrients increases, and (d) the mechanism responsible for the increase in total capacity will be an increase in amount of intestine rather than an increase in intestinal tissue-specific enzyme activity or nutrient transporter activity. Contrary to predictions, Canada geese fed lower qual? ity food (50% fiber) had lower food intake, longer retention times, and larger foreguts compared to geese fed higher quality food (30% fiber). Digestive efficiency and tissue- specific enzyme and nutrient uptake activity did not change with forage quality. Patterns of specific uptake rates and enzyme hydroly? sis rates suggest that geese feeding on rela? tively low quality diets maintain high rates of ileal uptake and thereby increase their inte? grated uptake capacity without the costs as? sociated with increasing hindgut mass. In the wild, geese compensate for the reduc? tion in food intake associated with reduced diet quality by increasing feeding time; how? ever, there are limits to this strategy, espe? cially when risk of predation or disturbance is high or when daylight is short. The in? crease in gut size associated with reduced diet quality may represent the primary di? gestive constraint that determines the Iow? est quality of food eaten by geese that must fly. S6.9 MEAD, K S., University of California, Berkeley An interdisciplinary, multilevel ap? proach to olfaction in stomatopods. Mantis shrimp rely on their sense of smell to find food, mates, and habitat. They sample their olfactory environment by flicking their antennules with a rapid outstroke followed by a slow return stroke. Flicking facilitates fluid and odorant access to the chemosen? sory sensillae (aesthetascs) on the anten? nule. I measured velocity gradients near dy- namically scaled models of aesthetasc ar- rays from juvenile and adult stomatopods using particle image velocimetry. More fluid flows between the aesthetascs on the flick outstroke than on the return stroke. This asymmetry ensures that new fluid is sampled during each flick. The velocity data was in? corporated into an advection-diffusion model of odorant molecule arrival at the aesthetasc surface. Odor molecules arrive at the sensillar surface more quickly during the outstroke than during the return stroke of the flick, suggesting that the two strokes have different functions. Odorant access is also affected by the sensillar position on the an? tennule, and by the position along the aesthetasc. Reconstruction of serial trans? mission electron micrographs indicates that there are several features of both the inter? nal and external aesthetasc structure that facilitate efficient odor sampling. For in- stance, velocity gradients are steeper, per- mitting more rapid odorant access, along the distal portion of the aesthetasc. This outer region is where the aesthetasc cuticle is the thinnest, and where the outer dendritic seg? ments are the most highly branched, provid? ing maximum surface area for putative odor receptors. Recent experiments, measuring odor concentration and velocity at the an? tennule as stomatopods track odor plumes, will help us discover how stomatopods use odor arrival information to navigate to the plume source.

Marine invertebrates that reproduce by external fertilization release their eggs and sperm into the water column. For animals living in the surf zone, this means that their gametes are exposed to high energy dissi- pation rates (up to 3000 W/m3) associated with breaking waves. To test the effects of surf zone turbulence, fertilization experi? ments were carried out in a Couette cell, a device that creates reproducible energy dis- sipation rates. Gametes from seven species of sea urchins were exposed to energy dis- sipation rates typical of wave-exposed surf 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Exposure to high energy dissipation rates during fertilization decreased fertiliza? tion and developmental success in several species. The energy dissipation rate created in the Couette cell is affected by both the velocity gradients in the fluid, and the vis- cosity of the fluid. Some potential mecha? nisms of turbulent action vary with viscosity, and others are affected by the velocity gra? dient. To assess which mechanisms of tur? bulent action might be operating viscosity and velocity gradient were varied separately in a series of Couette cell experiments. A potential mechanism of turbulent action that emerged from this analysis was that surf zone turbulence might affect fertilization success is to interfere with gamete binding. This hy? pothesis was tested by counting the num? ber of sperm bound to eggs after exposure to energy dissipation rates during fertiliza? tion. In addition, the importance of egg size (relative to turbulent eddy size) is discussed for fertilization and development. 12.5 MEAGHER, E.*, PABST, D.A., MCLELLAN, W, WESTGATE, A, WELLS, R, University of North Carolina, Wilmington, Duke University Marine Lab, Chicago Zoo? logical Society. Heart rate, respiration and heat flux across the dorsal fin in wild bottle? nose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus. The dolphin dorsal fin is a thermal win- dow, invested with blood vessels that func? tion to conserve or dissipate body heat de? pending on thermoregulatory demands. Heat flux, measured at a single position on the dorsal fin of bottlenose dolphins, de? creases during dives, relative to values mea? sured at the surface (Williams etal., 1999). This decrease has been attributed to dimin- ished peripheral blood flow as a result of bradycardia during a dive. Dolphins, how? ever, are arrhythmic breathers, experienc? ing cycles of bradycardia, followed by an associated tachycardia during respiration, even while resting at the surface. Thus, we hypothesized that heat flux across the dor? sal fin would decrease during apneustic pe? riods at the surface. We took simultaneous and continuous recordings of heart rate, res? piration and heat flux at three positions on the dorsal fin (in air and with fin submerged) of 19 wild bottlenose dolphins. Tachycardia was associated with each respiratory event and heart rate, although variable, decreased during intervening breathholds. Heat flow across the dorsal fin in air ranged from -60W/ m2 (gaining heat) to 150 W/m2, while heat flow during submergence ranged from 25 W/m2 to 225 W/m2. Although no consistent pattern between heart rate and heat flux was evident, heat flow values depended strongly upon fin position. Heat flow measured at two sites on the center of the fin- one directly over a superficial vein and the other pur- posely avoiding a vein- could differ by as much as 125 W/m2. These results suggest heat flux across the dorsal fin is strongly in? fluenced by underlying patterns of vascula? ture. Funded by NMFS.

Development of the electric organ of the skate, Raja eglanteria. The electric organ of Raja eglanteria con? sists of paired, longitudinal columns of electrocytes within the lateral musculature of the tail. Although it is known that electrocytes develop from embryonic hy? paxial muscle fibers within the tail, little in? formation exists on the stages of this differ? entiation process. Examination of H&amp;E stained paraffin sections through the tail of skate embryos sampled at weekly intervals (hatching occurs around week 12) and at 3 months post-hatching, reveals that each electrocyte develops from a single skeletal muscle fiber. Prior to the 4th week of devel? opment the tail consists exclusively of skel? etal muscle fibers oriented in a rostrocaudal direction. During the 4th week some of the skeletal muscle fibers begin to differentiate into electroblasts. Electroblasts are distin? guished from adjacent skeletal muscle fibers by an increase in number of nuclei and a shortening of fiber length. As development proceeds (weeks 6-8), electroblasts con? tinue to shorten as the rostral end expands to form a club-shaped cell. In addition, nerve fibers appear at the rostral end of each electroblast indicating formation of the mo- 1128 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="205">tor end plate. Further expansion of the ros? tral end and regression and thinning of the caudal end result in the formation of a thick, transversely oriented disc-like cell by the 10th week. The 3 layers of a typical disc- shaped electrocyte, which include the elec? tric plate, striated, and alveolar layers, are easily identified at this time. Further devel? opment of the electrocytes up to and after hatching involves an expansion and thin? ning of the disc in the transverse plane. Electrocytes of Raja eglanteria are fully dif? ferentiated by 3 months of age. P1.95A MEDLER, S., Colorado State University. Comparative trends in maxi? mum shortening velocity and tetanic ten? sion: influence on skeletal muscle diver? sity. Maximum shortening velocity (Vmax) and maximum tetanic tension (P0) are two de? terminants of a muscle's contractile proper? ties. Muscle power output, contractile effi? ciency, and ultimately the energetics of lo? comotion are all linked to Vmax. P0 defines a muscle's force production and is generally considered to be constant, although signifi? cant differences have been found among some fiber types. In this study, published values of Vmax and P0 for more than 90 muscles representing three phyla and about 50 animal species were analyzed. P0 was found to be constant at about 150 kN/m2, being unrelated to body mass, phylogenic group, or shortening velocity. As such, P0 may represent a design constraint in the evolution of skeletal muscle diversity. In con? trast, a significant inverse correlation (p &lt; 0.0001) was found between body mass and Vmax in locomotory muscles, consistent with Hill's observation that smaller animals pos? sess faster muscles. Body mass alone ac? counts for almost 50% (f = 0.48) of the vari? ability among the different shortening veloci? ties, independent of either phylogenic group or mode of locomotion. Neither the ultimate cause nor the molecular mechanisms re? sponsible for this scaling effect is fully un? derstood. The mass exponent of -0.19 is about the same as described for quadrupe? dal mammals, but is derived from a much more diverse group of animals than previ- ously studied. At a molecular level, differ? ences in Vmax are generally associated with different myosin isoforms and this is prob? ably the case here. How animals experi? encing indeterminate growth sense mass changes and then appropriately switch their muscles' contractile properties is unknown, but provides an interesting model of muscu? lar plasticity. 27.1 MEIJER, K*, LIBBY, TM, FULL, R.J, University of California, Berkeley. Passive stability provided by the musculo-skeletal properties of an insect leg. Cockroaches have an amazing ability to run over rough terrain. It has been hypoth? esized that their ability to perform stable lo? comotion in unstructured environments is fa? cilitated by the mechanical properties of their muscles and exoskeleton. To investigate the passive stabilizing properties of individual legs, we measured the mechanical imped? ance of the metathoracic limb of tethered cockroaches (Blaberus discoidalis).The hind limb of the cockroach was attached to a muscle lever system with a stainless steel rod. Sinusoidal length oscillations (2-25 Hz, 1-5 mm) were imposed on the hind limb in the plane of leg movement when muscles were relaxed. The resulting angular changes of the coxa-femur and femur-tibia joints amounted to 10-40 % of their natural range of motion. We found that the peak leg forces in response to the length oscillations ranged from 2.8 - 8 mN, which is within the range reported for single leg forces of freely run? ning cockroaches (Full et al., 1991). Analy? sis of the displacement- force data indicated that the leg behaves as a spring-damper sys? tem. The magnitude of impedance (Dforce/ Dlength) ranged from 5-15 mN/mm and showed no effect of oscillation frequency. These values are substantially lower than those found for out of plane oscillations. It suggests that in a relaxed animal the re? sponse is slower for planar vs. non-planar perturbations. The tangent of the phase angle increased with frequency from 0.2 - 0.9, indicating that a significant part of the energy introduced by perturbations is dissi- pated in the leg. Our next step is to use a model of the cockroach leg to determine the 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Yellow-blotched map turtles, Graptemys flavimaculata, from a portion of the Pascagoula River drainage system in Mis? sissippi, USA, impacted by paper mill efflent, exhibit low reproductive rates. Significantly fewer females from a historically contami? nated site develop second clutches when compared to females from a reference site (e.g. 17% vs 50%). However, there were no significant differences found in the monthly mean plasma 17BETA-estrodiol (E) levels of females from the two sites. Female fish from sites contaminated by bleached kraft mill effluent exhibit lowered E as well as low- ered ovarian aromatase activity. We com? pared aromatase activity in ovarian and he? patic tissue of females collected from an im? pacted and reference site in June-July, 1999. Female map turtles from the contaminated site exhibited significantly lower mean ova? rian aromatase activity levels than those from the reference site. Hepatic aromatase activ? ity did not differ between sites. In June-July 2000, we collected additional females from the two sites, and biopsied several ovarian follicles from them. The difference in aromatase activity between sites using the biopsied follicles did not differ from the pat? tern found when entire ovaries were used in 1999 when corrected for protein content. Additionally, we examined the levels of aromatase mRNA of embryos from impacted and reference sites and these results will be discussed.

Male big brown bats exhibit a dissoci? ated pattern of reproduction. They mate in the late fall and throughout the winter upon periodic arousal from hibernation when tes? tosterone (T) is basal and gonads are re- gressed. In previous experiments, males mated even when gonadectomized (GX) several months before the beginning of the mating season, if they are exposed to an initial period of 5 C for 7 d and then allowed to return to 22 C. However, GX males given flutamide (F) did not mate until the very end of the test period (Mar, 1999). In Jan-March 2000, we continued to examine the interac? tions of temperature and T on male mating behavior. Males were divided into 5 groups: INTACT, SHAM, GX, GX+T, and GX+F. Males from each group were divided into 3 tem? perature regimens: constant 22 C (CON? STANT), repeated exposures of 5 C for 7 d (LONG), and repeated exposures to 5 C for 1 d (PULSE) with returns to 22 C for 4 d. Based on previous data, we predicted males not exposed to low temperature (CON? STANT) would not exhibit mating behavior. Contrary to prediction, males of all treatment groups (including GX+F) exhibited mating behavior when exposed to CONSTANT. However, INTACT males exposed to LONG exhibited significantly higher levels of mat? ing behavior than INTACTs exposed to PULSE or CONSTANT conditions. Addition- ally, when, after 2 months, the CONSTANT group was given LONG exposure, males from all treatment groups exhibited signifi? cantly higher levels of mating. This result ar- gues that exposure to low temperatures for a period of time does potentiate mating be? havior in males of this species. Especially intriguing was the behavior of the GX+F groups. The CONSTANT GX+F males ex? hibited significantly much higher mating scores than those in the PULSE and LONG condition. Thus, it appears flutamide is inef- fective at blocking mating behavior at higher temperatures but seems effective when ani? mals are exposed to either short or long pe? riods of low temperature with subsequent warming.

Heterodimerization of retinoid X receptors (RXRs) with receptors of thyroid hormone (TRs) is crucial for action of the latter, re? sponsible for tissue remodeling during metamorphosis. Presently we found that retinol palmitate (106 M) treatment during prometamorphic stage (stage 55/56 Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1967) accelerates metamorphic events in tadpoles of Xeno? pus laevis as confirmed by morphologi? cal, histological and ultrastructural obser? vations in various organs.

Members of the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors, which are obligate heterodimeric partners of the retinoid X re? ceptors, may be important in amphibian post? embryonic development. Here, we exam? ined the effects of retinol palmitate, and of clofibrate (agonist of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors n PPARs) on two organs - tail epidermis and limb bud of the tadpoles of Xenopus laevis in vitro . Amputated tails and limb buds during (stage 54/55, Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1967) were main- tained in vitro with two retinol concentrations (106 M,105 M) and clofibrate (103 M).Tails and limbs were maintained in culture me? dium for 72 h and 96 h respectively and tis? sues were processed for electron micros? copy. ln Xenopus laevis, tail epidermis is bi- layered with underlying collagen layers. While there were no observable changes in tail epidermis retinol concentration of 106 M, higher retinol concentration (105 M) in? duced large-scale apoptosis and sloughing of the epidermis. Limb buds, when treated with retinol showed differentiation of the dig? its. Clofibrate treatment induced significant epidermal lipid deposits and loss of struc? tural integrity of tail epidermis. No change in cartilage differentiation was observed in the limb buds following clofibrate treatment. We hypothesize that at developmental stage 54/ 55, PPAR agonists may not have a signifi? cant role to play in limb morphogensis in contrast to ligands of retinoid receptors and the effects of PPAR agonist in tail tissue may be related to a different developmental fate (regression) of this organ.

Morphological specializations of the feeding system in horned lizards (Phrynosoma). Lizards of the genus Phrynosoma have long been noted as dietary specialists, feed? ing predominately on various species of ants. Several studies looking at the diet of the four? teen different species of Phrynosoma have noted that there appears to be a gradation in the percentage of ants eaten by each spe? cies. As part of study looking at the form and function of the feeding system in Phrynosoma we compared the relative masses of all the jaw and hyolingual muscles in several species. A strong correlation ex- ists between the relative mass of the jaw adductors and depressors and volume of ants eaten. Species such as P. Douglassi, which have large adductor mass, have a larger percentage of other insects in their diet. Whereas species with a higher per? centage of ants in the diet have smaller ad? ductors but larger jaw openers. This transi? tion appears to be a trade-off between be? tween a generalist and specialist diet. Larger adductors may allow generalists to process larger, harder prey items. Ant specialists do not need to crush prey and it may be more important to open the mouth quickly when capturing small, fast prey. These observa? tions are supported by some preliminary ki? nematic and bite force data in two species. P3.105A MEYLAN, S.*, CLOBERT, J, DE FRAIPONT, M., Universite Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6. Maternal stress and juve? nile dispersal in the common lizard. The causes of phenotypic variation among individuals are of interest to many scientists in Evolutionary Ecology. A phe? notype results from genetic and environ? mental influences. We are interested in the influences of maternal environment on phenotypic variation in natal dispersal. Offspring natal dispersal, as are other life history traits, is influenced by prenatal en? vironment. An adaptive maternal control of offspring behavior may promote off? spring fitness in temporally predictable en- vironments. Conversely, maternal effects could be maladaptive due to the time lag of the response to selection. In the com? mon lizard Lacerta vivipara, a suite of ex? periments has shown that maternal con? dition during gestation affects juvenile dis? persal, and we hypothesized that the con? dition of the mother reflects her own health (i.e. her future survival prospects) rather than the quality of the environment. Fur? thermore, Kin competition was shown to be very important in shaping natal dis? persal in common lizards. To explore this hypothesis, we induced stress in pregnant females by application of corticosterone and we measured dispersal and morphol? ogy of juveniles. No effect was found on morphology. However, offspring dispersal from stressed mothers was decreased for large-sized (old) mothers, and increased for small-sized (young) females. So, fe? male age influenced the stress effect, and one can argue that corticosterone is not the only factor affecting the development of the dispersal phenotype. P1.75MIDDLE, LB.*, BARNES, B.M, Uni? versity of Alaska, Fairbanks. Overwintering strategies of the wood frog, Rana sylvatica, in interior Alaska. The wood frog, Rana sylvatica, is one of the most northerly distributed amphibian species with populations ranging up to 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle. The key to its survival at high latitudes is the ability to sur? vive extracellular freezing of body tissues, an adaptation shared by only six species of vertebrates. Laboratory studies of limits to cold tolerance of R. sylvatica have concen? trated on individuals from southern popula? tions from Ohio, USA and Ottawa, Canada. These studies determined a lower lethal body temperature (50% survival) of -8?C and limits to survival duration of freezing of ca. one month. Within the range of their distri? bution in Alaska, average ambient air tem? peratures range from -19.4?C to below -30?C from October to April, and soil-snow inter? face temperatures are regularly below -10?C, 2?C below the lower lethal temperature. Wood frogs overwinter in terrestrial habitats with individuals found within the leaf layer 1132 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Wood frogs in Alaska may survive prolonged freezing and minimum temperatures below lower lethal temperatures known from southern popula? tions. Alternatively, Wood frogs in Alaska may share limits to freeze tolerance with south? ern populations and survive at high latitudes by finding hibernacula that are protected from extreme temperatures. We explore poten? tial mechanisms of extended freeze toler? ance by determining hepatic glycogen and tissue levels of glucose in captive animals before, during and after freezing to these new limits. This comparison adds insight as to whether Wood frogs in Interior Alaska dif? fer physiologically in their mechanisms of freeze tolerance from southern populations. In addition, we present temperatures expe? rienced by naturally hibernating Wood frogs in Interior Alaska. P2.73 MIDDLETON, KM, Brown University, Providence Rl. Influence of hallucal rever- sion on terrestrial locomotion in birds. The reversed or opposable avian hallux (digit I) has been the subject of few anatomi? cal or functional studies. Primitively, the theropod hallux was short and did not nor? mally reach the substrate during locomotion, while the reversed hallux of birds represents a subsequent elongation and rotation of digit I. It has been proposed that the presence of a reversed hallux in a terrestrial theropod would hinder over-ground locomotion and, therefore, would have evolved exclusively in an arboreal form. I recorded foot force out? put and center of pressure variation in the European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris). The hallux of the European Starling is large - approximately equal to the length of digit III - and is in contact with the substrate over the full length of the digit. During most of the stride cycle, the center of pressure is located near the base of digit III, and the hallux contrib? utes significantly to the ground force of the foot. A contrasting outcome would be ex? pected in a bird with a reduced hallux that has less contact with the ground. Possible tradeoffs of hallucal reversion include a larger potential base of support and better stability and increased mechanical advan? tage at the tarsometatarsal joint contrasted with altered locomotor kinematics. 23.1 MILLER, LA., Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New Yo. A math? ematical model of insect flight: the immersed boundary method with fling. Lift generation by insects at low Reynoldfs numbers has been a subject of great inter? est to some biologists, engineers, and math- ematicians over the past few decades. Un- fortunately, a realistic mathematical model of insect flight, including a flexible wing mov? ing with three axes of rotation, has been computationally difficult to model. The im? mersed boundary method offers a reason? able approach toward modeling a flexible, moving boundary in a three-dimensional fluid. In this presentation, results from a two- dimensional model of the clap and fling mechanism in Drosophila melanogasterwill be shown. These results include movies of the vorticity field over time and lift generated over time for varying angular velocities and initial angles between the wings during fling. Preliminary results from a three-dimensional model of flight in Drosophila using experi? mentally determined flight kinematics with three axes of rotation will also be presented. S2.1 MINELLI, A, University of Padova. Ho? mology, limbs and genitalia. Similarities in genetic control between the main body axis and its appendages have been generally explained in terms of genetic co-option. This extends to the parallels in the patterning of arthropod and vertebrate ap? pendages, which have been explained ei? ther invoking a common ancestor already provided with patterned body outgrowths, or as the effect of independent recruitment in limb patterning of single genes or genetic cassettes originally used for purposes other than axis patterning. I have suggest instead that these body appendages are evolution? arily divergent duplicates (paramorphs) of the main body axis. The same interpretation may also apply to genitalia, irrespective of whether they are modified limbs, or directly derive ex novo from a duplication of the main body axis. But, are all metazoan limbs and genitalia homologous? Are limbs homolo? gous to genitalia (in vertebrates, or in other phyla)? The answer to these question is never a simple yes or no.

The concept of body appendages (limbs and genitalia) as paramorphs of the main body axis eliminates the requirement for the last common ancestor of limb-bear- ing animals to have been provided with limbs.

P3.22MINER, B.G*, MCEDWARD, L.R., Uni? versity of Florida, Gainesville. Diversity and evolution of larval patterns in holothuroid echinoderms. Larval types and developmental patterns have been well studied in the echinoderm classes, asteroids and echinoids. In con? trast, the other classes of echinoderms, crinoids, holothuroids, and ophiuroids, have been ignored. We have reviewed the litera? ture on 69 species of holothuroids focusing on the phylogenetic distribution of develop? mental patterns and larval types within the clade. There are three observed larval types: auricularia, doliolaria, and vitellaria. Al? though not documented, facultative planktotrophy and a direct development may exist. Phylogenetic distribution of these lar? val types suggests that the auricularia has been lost 8 times, and that the vitellaria has evolved 3-6 times within the group. The de? velopmental patterns that have been docu? mented are planktotrophy, pelagic lecithotrophy, and benthic lecithotrophy. As? suming a planktotrophic ancestor, the phy? logenetic distribution of these patterns sug? gests that brooding has evolved 6 times within the holothuroids. In light of the few studies documenting developmental types within holothuroids, the possible evolution? ary changes that can explain the observed types are complex. Future studies on devel- opmental diversity, as well as a better un? derstanding of phylogenetic relationships, are necessary to elucidate the evolution of larval patterns in this group.

Immunolocalization of na+- dependent anion exchanger (NDAE1) in anterior stomach of mosquito larvae (Aedes aegypti): relevance to gut alkalinization. A Na+-dependent anion exchanger (NDAE1) with homology to vertebrate bicar? bonate transporters has recently been cloned from Drosophila and expressed in Xenopus oocytes.* In its orthograde mode NDAE1 mediates extrusion of CI and/or H+ in exchange for entry of Na+ and HC03. NDAE1, like other bicarbonate transporters, is likely involved in both cytoplasmic acid- base homeostasis and transepithelial acid and alkali secretion. In these studies, fluo? rescence immunohistochemistry against several conserved epitopes of NDAE1 showed localization in anterior stomach (and other epithelia and CNS neurons) of mos? quito larvae. The anterior stomach gener? ates a luminal pH of -10; the cellular mecha? nisms of this active alkali secretion are largely unknown. In the anterior stomach, NDAE1 immunoreactivity was abundant in basolateral plasma membranes. This loca? tion is consistent with a model of alkaliniza? tion driven by tandem operation of basolateral Na7K+ ATPase and electrogenic V-type H+ ATPase. The large electrochemi- cal gradient for Na+ created by these pumps would provide the necessary ionic gradients for NDAE1, driving H+ from cell to hemolymph and HC03" from hemolymph to cytoplasm. Since NDAE1 also appears in apical cell membranes, and since mosquito larvae ingest their very-low-Na+ freshwater medium, it may function in the antigrade mode in apical membranes, mediating cell- to-lumen movement of Na+ and HC03\ *Romero et al.

Ablation of a slug's procerebral lobe blocks its ability to diseriminate water sources that are dan- gerous for rehydration. Limax maximus, the common garden slug, can experience dramatic reduction in body water and then is highly motivated to find a source of moisture for rehydration through the body surface (Matanock and Welsford,1995). In nature, appropriate sources of moisture often have odors asso? ciated with them. Slugs sense odors prima? rily with their major tentacles, from which in? formation projects into a lobe of the brain called the procerebral lobe. The procerebral lobe has been implicated in odor learning (Teyke and Gelperin, 1999). In this experi? ment, we tested the hypothesis that slugs could be trained to associate odors with water that was unsafe for rehydrating and that this behavior might be missing in slugs that lacked tentacles or the procerebral lobe. We dehydrated slugs and used three trials, spaced over 24 hours, to force them into con? tact with the dangerous (NaCl- and quinine- added), odor-laden (e.g., orange, cherry, pineapple) water for 2 min. After each dehy? dration and training exposure, we rehydrated them in an odor free container. In the test situation, 14 of 21 trained control slugs choose to rehydrate on a water source paired with a novel odor rather than in water paired with the odor previously associated with dan? gerous water. Slugs with the procerebral lobe ablated on one side and the tentacle cut off on the other side behave as if they cannot smell. Of 11 such operated slugs, trained and tested as described above, 7 chose to rehydrate on the water source pre? viously paired with the dangerous water. These data and our behavioral observations suggest that the combination of the unilat? eral procerebral lobe operation and con- tralateral sensory ablation can prevent the slugs from learning, perhaps by producing anosmia. 42.5 MONROY, J.A.*, NISHIKAWA, K.C., Northern Arizona University. Aiming during prey capture in microhylid frogs. Microhylid frogs have the unusual ability to aim their tongues independently of the head during prey capture. The tongue is elongated hydrostatically, which requires a novel protractor muscle (m. genioglossus) morphology. This novel morphology and demand for fine motor control raised the question: Are there unusual aspects to the innervation of the tongue muscles in microhylids? Retrograde labeling of the hy? poglossal nerve revealed an exceptional ly large number of motor neurons distributed more caudally in the brainstem when com? pared to other anurans. In addition, dener? vation and EMG experiments have demon? strated that the m. genioglossus is the pri? mary muscle responsible for aiming the tongue within the Microhylidae. Thus, an in? crease in motor neurons may have resulted from an increase in the innervation of the m. genioglossus required to produce hydro? static elongation and aim the tongue. The speed of tongue protraction is highly vari? able between species (30 n 200 cm/s). Pre? liminary results suggest that microhylids with slower protraction speeds will have a larger number of motor neurons innervating the m. genioglossus, which allows more control over the tongue than microhylids that pro- tract their tongues at faster speeds. This hy? pothesis suggests a trade-off between the speed of protraction and the degree of con? trol over the tongue in three dimensions. This trade-off may also reflect a frogis feeding strategy and ecological niche. 9.1 MONTOOTH, K.L*, CLARK, A.G., MARDEN, J.H, Pennsylvania State Univer? sity, University Park. Physiological genetics of flight performance in Drosophila melanogaster.

Using a computer- ized tracking system, we quantified varia? tion in components offree-flight performance among genetically characterized lines of D. melanogaster. From f rame-to-f rame changes in three-dimensional location we calculated path velocity, acceleration and angular tra? jectory for individual flights. Differences among lines were found to be far greater than the variability among replicate flights of flies from the same line. Measures of ge? netic variation in components of free-flight performance among 98 recombinant-inbred lines of D. melanogaster were used to con? struct a map of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL). The QTL map revealed regions of the ge? nome that were significantly associated with variation in flight performance. The relation? ship between variation in flight performance and variation in metabolic rate, metabolic enzyme activity, and glycogen and triacylglycerol concentration was investi? gated using multiple regression models. The extent to which regions of the genome ex? hibited pleiotropic effects on multiple meta? bolic traits will also be discussed. This quan? titative genetic approach gives us insight into what might be the genetic response to se? lection on whole organism physiological performance.

In vivo shortening in the superfast tailshaker muscle of rattlesnakes. Sound-producing muscles typically con? tract at high frequencies with minimal short? ening. The tailshaker muscle of western dia? mondback rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrorf con- tracts at frequencies of 20-100 Hz and has a constant energetic cost per twitch, but its ex? tent of shortening is unknown. Decreasing lateral displacement of the rattle with in? creasing twitch frequency suggests that the muscles shorten less at higher twitch fre? quencies. However, the constant cost per twitch suggests that muscle shortening is constant. We are using sonomicrometry to measure muscle shortening in vivo and to test three factors that may account for the apparent discrepancy between muscle en? ergetics and mechanics: (1) A tradeoff be? tween lateral and torsional rotation of the rattle with increasing twitch frequency may involve a tradeoff in shortening among the three groups of tailshaker muscles. (2) The extent of eccentric contraction may vary with twitch frequency, which could change the force and displacement per twitch with mini? mal or no change in cost. (3) Rattle motion may be ballistic, with the maximal displace? ment being limited by the timing of contralat- eral twitches rather than by the extent of ac? tive muscle shortening. Preliminary results indicate that all three factors are important. Quantitative analysis, now under way, may show how each factor contributes to changes in muscle and rattle mechanics without changing the muscle energetics. S9.9 MOORE, FL*, Oregon State Univer? sity Ultimate and proximate mechanisms that control the stress-induced inhibition of reproductive behaviors. When animals confront harsh or threat- ening conditions, they frequently respond with rapid changes in behavior, for example, switching from courtship behavior to survival behaviors such as hiding or fleeing. Stress hormones regulate this shift in behavioral state. Behavioral studies in an amphibian model, the roughskin newt (Taricha granu? losa), demonstrate that acute stress triggers the secretion of corticosterone and that the elevated corticosterone concentration causes a rapid suppression of reproductive behaviors. This behavioral response to cor? ticosterone works through a non-genomic pathway that involves a membrane-associ- ated corticosteroid receptor (mCR) in the G- protein coupled receptor superfamily (Orchinik et al., 1991).The mCR protein has an apparent mass of 63 kDa (Evans et al., 2000a). The mCR binding site is highly se? lective, recognizing only two steroids (corti? costerone and cortisol) and a subset of kappa-selective ligands (Orchinik et al., 1991; Evans et al. 2000b).These binding data are consistent with behavioral and physi? ological studies showing that corticosterone and specific kappa ligands trigger similar 1136 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

Latitudinal gradient in sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary- gonadal axis to gonadotropin-releasing hor? mone. Field investigations have revealed com? plex patterns of testosterone levels in verte? brates. Even in closely related taxa and within populations (especially birds) patterns of testosterone secretion may be dramati? cally different. The mechanisms underlying this variation in patterns remain unciear. At the secretion level, differences in plasma testosterone levels could result from differ? ences in activity or sensitivity of the hypo- thalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis.To ad? dress this we challenged birds from differ? ent latitudes with similar doses of gonadot? ropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and mea? sured resulting plasma levels of testoster? one. If bird populations respond similarly to the GnRH challenge then observed differ? ences in plasma testosterone may be the result of differences in activity of the HPG axis. If bird populations respond differently to the GnRH challenge then observed dif? ferences in plasma testosterone may be the result of differences in sensitivity of the HPG axis. We performed the experiment in two populations of white crown sparrows: the high latitude breeding Gambleis white crown sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii) in Toolik, Alaska and the mid latitude breed? ing Puget Sound white crown sparrow (Z /. pugetensis ) from Washington. Birds were captured and received a 500ng of GnRH and a blood sample obtained either 10 or 30 minutes later. GnRH treated birds from both populations had significantly higher plasma levels of testosterone after 30 min? utes that was not evident at 10 minutes post injection. There was no difference in the re? sponse between the mid and high latitude populations of birds. We are currently ex? tending this study to a low latitude popula? tion of rufous-collared sparrow (Z capensis) in central Ecuador. 15.4 MOORE, M.C.*, PAINTER, D., WOODLEY, S.K, LACY, E.L, JENNINGS, D.H, WIKELSKI, M., Arizona State Univer? sity, Tempe, Arizona State University, Tempe, Boston Univ, Boston, Arizona State Univer? sity, Tempe, Arizona State University, Tempe, Princeton University, Princeton. Neuroendo? crine mechanisms of alternative male repro? ductive tactics in marine iguanas. Alternative male phenotypes often dif? fer as much in appearance and behavior as do males from females. These extreme examples of within-sex variation are good models to examine neuroendocrine bases of such variation. The relative plasticity hy? pothesis (RPH) generalizes the organiza- tion-activation model of sexual differentia? tion to within-sex variation. It proposes that species with fixed alternative male mor? phs will have developmental (organiza- tional) mechanisms of differentiation whereas species with plastic alternative male morphs will use activational mecha? nisms. In this study, we examined marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus), which have a complex system of plastic alterna? tive male phenotypes: there are 3 distinct morphologies and 5 distinct social classes. Since males transform types as they age, the RPH predicts that there will be hor? monal mechanisms operating at the time of transformation. Comparison of testoster? one (T) levels in free-living males from the Genovesa Island population partially con? firms this prediction. Males of the two nonterritorial classes had T levels lower than those of males in the two successful territorial classes. Furthermore, when sub? jected to 30 minutes of handling stress, nonterritorial males increased their T lev? els whereas successful territorial males did not. Unsuccessful territorial males were intermediate. These results contrast with those from species with fixed systems and suggest that activational neuroendo? crine mechanisms are important in plastic alternative male phenotypes of marine iguanas. 800-955-1236 ?

IAMS, E.E., Salisbury State University Docosahexaenoic acid in cell membranes: vital for fish and fatal for cancer. It is known that cells from fish main? tained in cold water contain much higher amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) than cells of the same fish at warmer tem? peratures. DHA is also associated with the alleviation of many human diseases. In ad? dition, it severely inhibits the growth of tu- mor cells. In all of these cases, there is evidence that the incorporation of DHA into cellular membranes is the common bond between these events. Thus, there seems to be a dichotomy of consequences to the presence of DHA in cellular membranes. Our research is focused on why DHA is lethal to tumor cells and beneficial to cold- water fish. We cultured murine leukemia cells (T27A line) at 37/C in various con? centrations of DHA and measured prolif? eration rates and cell viability in order to verify the anti-cancer properties of DHA on this cell line. At concentrations below 150 mg/mL, DHA had no effect on either variable. At concentrations above 150 mg/ mL, a significant reduction in both of these parameters was observed. For example, after four days of culture at 300 mg/mL DHA, only 22% of the cells present re? mained viable and cell numbers fell dra? matically. Cells grown in the presence of oleic acid at the same concentrations and length of time grew at the same rate as control cells. These data confirm the sen? sitivity of this cell line to the anti-cancer effects of DHA. Currently, two sets of ex? periments are underway. The first set in? volves repeating the experiments on cells cultured at 27/C, a temperature decrease (10/C) known to cause an increase in the level of DHA in the membranes of fish cells. The second set uses fluorescent micros? copy to determine the mode of death in? duced by DHA (apoptosis or necrosis). Combined, these data will allow us to as? sess the interdependence of DHA and tem? perature as it relates to cell survival. 25.5 MOORE, A.M.F*, CHIU, H., LAWRENCE, B.A., Universityof the Pacific, Stockton, Ca, University ofthe Pacific, Stock- ton, Ca, Eastern Illinois University Charles? ton. Mechanical characterization of egg case silk in the black widow spider (Latrodectus hesperus). Silk from egg case of the black widow spider (Latrodectus hesperus) differs in amino acid composition from the animal's dragline silk. Because the primary function of an egg case is non-load bearing, we ex? pected that the molecular differences in the two silks might lead to differences in their material properties. To test this hypothesis, we stretched egg-case silk to breaking and compared the resulting stress-strain curve to the stress-strain curve of the animal's dra? gline silk. The two curves are similar in that they both have an initial linear region, fol? lowed by a yield point and then a second, less stiff, linear region. The presence of a yield point suggests a conformational change in the protein that, in turn, changes the way the molecular interactions resist the load as the silk is stretched. The two silks are also similar in strength and in the stiff? ness of the initial linear region of the curve. However, they differ in that (1) egg case silk is twice as extensible as dragline silk, (2) its yield point occurs at about three times higher strain and (3) after the yield point, egg case silk is almost an order of magnitude less stiff than dragline silk. We used carbon-13 solid state NMR spectroscopy to look at the sec? ondary structure of the silk proteins. The spectra show that the alanine in both dra? gline and egg case silk is in beta-sheet con? formation. This is consistent with the pres? ence of alanine-rich beta-sheet crystals commonly found in silks. The spectra also confirm the presence of a large amount of serine in the egg case silk that is not present in dragline silk. It is possible that serine af? fects the non-crystaline region of the mol? ecule to cause the observed differences in bulk properties.

While feeding at flowers in the wind, hovering hawk- moths must track a moving target in a spa? tially complex environment. Although the vi? sual system can discriminate motion in dif? ferent directions, characteristcs of the mus? culoskeletal system could constrain the pre- cision of directional control (eg., by introduc- ing 'crosstalk' into control pathways). More? over, frequency tuning in the visual system may be insufficient to account for the fre? quency response of tracking behavior at the organismal level. To understand the con? straints that emerge from sensorimotor inte? gration, we used 30Hz video to record hov? ering moths as they fed at artificial flowers. We oscillated the flowers sinusoidaly at 1,2, and 3 hz, and three amplitudes (-1,2,3 cm) for motion in the x- (looming), y- (vertical), and z-(lateral) directions. For each feeding bout, we calculated the gain of the moths' tracking behavior as the amplitude of moth motion relative to flower motion at the driv? ing frequency. For all three directions, the gain was Iowest at 3hz. Tracking behavior, however, had the greatest match of animal motion to flower motion at 2 hz for both loom? ing and lateral motions. Moreover, there is strong coupling between these components at all frequencies. The peak in tracking abil? ity is consistent with predictions from mod? els of motion detection. Our data, therefore, show a close alignment of whole organism dynamics with retinal and neuronal process? ing. (NSF IBN9511881, ONR to C.

Incubation temperatures were tracked for individual masked boobies nest? ing in a colony on the island of Espanola, Galapagos, Ecuador. Plastic Easter eggs, identical in size to actual eggs, containing water and a temperature data logger to record egg temperature, were sealed with white acrylic paint to more closely resemble natural eggs. Natural eggs in four, one-egg clutch nests were replaced with data logger eggs. Birds were allowed to incubate the logger eggs for 3 days. This procedure was repeated 13 times for a total of 52 nests. All egg temperatures remained above ambient temperature during incubation. Over the 3- day interval, mean egg temperatures were 37/C (range: 2 - 3/), while ambient tem? perature fluctuated cyclically throughout each 24-hour period from 22/C to 35/C.

Does digestive physiology limit re- fueling rates in migratory yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata)? Smaller guts and slow initial mass gains in migrating birds at stopover sites have led to the idea of a digestive limitation to refuel- ing in migrants. We tested the digestive limi? tation hypothesis in yellow-rumped warblers using food restriction to simulate infrequent feeding during migration, which may cause a reduction in alimentary tract mass. We pre? dicted that following three days of food re? striction (ca. 50% ad libitum intake): 1) di? gestive organ masses would decrease, 2) digestive capacity as measured by diges? tive enzyme activities would decrease, and 3) previously restricted birds would not be able to feed and digest at a high rate imme- diately following return to ad lib. feeding. In our tests of these predictions, restricted birds had small intestine, pancreas, and liver masses 18-22% lower than ad lib.-ied con? trols. Total activities of sucrase, maltase, ami- nopeptidase, and amylase were significantly lower (by 37-48%) in restricted birds than in controls, while those of trypsin and chymot? rypsin were not. Mass-specific activities did not differ significantly between groups ex? cept for aminopeptidase, which was lower in restricted birds. Contrary to our prediction, previously restricted birds were able to feed and digest at a significantly higher rate than the controls immediately following return to ad lib. feeding.

Others utilize core units with fle:,. Uty built in with additional materials for teachers to teach concepts of choice. Other materials utilize innova? tive changes in instructional design. Choosing materials is a responsibility; in? volving teachers, parents, scientists, school boards, superintendents, state se? lection committees and others; we provide these stakeholders with an accountable independent review of the spectrum of available materials. The goal is to help those who choose curricular materials for the nationis classrooms with a basis for making informed decisions. Results are variable, some meeting content standards, some meeting content and assessment standards, and some meeting content, pedagogical, assessment and profes- sional development standards. Teachers need materials that meet the national stan? dards and engage all students in opportu- nistic learning environments to become lit- erate in biology.

While bilateral symmetry is the ancestral state of molluscs, the gastropods have adopted various developmental pathways leading from bilateral symmetry to complex asymmetrical body plans. Because many of the asymmetrical organ systems are meso? dermal derivatives the identification of me? sodermal regulatory genes is essential for understanding how the molluscs diversified. It has been well demonstrated that Twistand Snail play a significant role in both determi? nation and differentiation of mesoderm in a variety of organisms. Thus, using the poly- merase chain reaction we have identified these two genes in the genomes of various molluscs. By in situ hybridization and Immu- nocytochemistry we have detected the ex? pression of Twist and Snail in mesodermal lineages of the marine mud snail llyanassa obsoleta. We have also found that both of these genes are maternally expressed. Throughout the animal kingdom there are a variety of different mechanisms for meso? derm formation, and our study of teloblastic mesoderm formation in a spiralian embryo extends the body of evidence for the con? servation of genes used for mesoderm for? mation. This body of evidence illustrates ge? nomic antiquity in the face of developmental diversifiction. 3.5 MOTANI, R., Royal Ontario Museum. Using models of extant swimmers to infer aspects of locomotion in thunniform ichthyo- saurs. Studying the functional morphology of extinct vertebrates poses challenges be? cause only fossil remains are available. Robust correlations among certain physical, physiological, or kinematic variables in ex? tant vertebrates can help infer functional parameters of extinct animals.

McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="217">case where such correlational approaches prove useful in estimating some swimming characteristics of extinct marine reptiles. Ich- thyosaurs (250 to 90 million years ago) evolved a tuna-like body shape from a liz- ard-like body plan of their ancestors, and some well-preserved specimens of the ge? nus Stenopterygius, for example, show the outlines of lunate caudal fins. I used two correlations observed among living swim? ming vertebrates to estimate optimal swim? ming speeds in Stenopterygius (0.5 to 2.5 m fork length). The first set of estimates was based on the scaling of caudal fin kinemat? ics observed in thunniform, carangiform, and subcarangiform swimmers. The second set was derived from the commonly used ener? getic model of constantly swimming verte? brates. The first estimates showed an almost identical distribution to the second set, pro? viding some confidence in the results ob? tained, and suggesting that Stenopterygius cruised more slowly than delphinids of simi? lar body size. The two estimation methods were tested by applying them to extant swim? ming vertebrates, prior to the application to Stenopterygius. The methods successfully approximated the optimal speed values in the literature (based on speed vs. oxygen consumption data). These results hold the promise of testable quantifications of some general performance variables in extinct swimming vertebrates, and of more accu? rate characterization of their functional and ecological modes of life. 51.1 MOTZ, A.M., WOLCOTT, TG.*, WOLCOTT, D.L, HINES, AH, NC State Uni? versity, Raleigh, NC State University, Ra? leigh, NC State University, Raleigh, Smithsonian Env. Research Ctr., Edgewater MD. Sperm limitation and operational sex ratio in blue crabs. To understand whether the intense fish? ery on male blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) is leading to sperm limitation and reduced reproductive potential in Chesapeake Bay populations, we are investigating whether the number of males, or their adequacy as mates, is diminished. A long-term S.E.R.C. trawl data set is being analyzed for evidence that the male:female ratio has changed his- torically. We have developed biotelemetry systems for free-ranging crabs to measure latencies to pairing and mating for each gen? der, as well as to reveal where these activi? ties occur and thus where operational sex ratio should be measured. We are collect- ing crabs engaged in pre- or post-copula- tory mate guarding ("doublers") from the field. Many small males are mating, even though they could be displaced if large ones were present. A large proportion of the males in the Bay is severely sperm-depleted. Large males caught as "doublers" often possess and deliver no more seminal resources than do small ones, even though we would ex? pect them to deliver much more if they were "fully-recharged". The most-depleted males are not found as "doublers" and apparently are not mating. This indicates that the op? erational sex ratio is lower than suggested by the numerical ratio of adult males to pu- bertal females. Even if a proportion of the males that escape the fishery is not mating, the remaining number seems adequate to provide almost all females with at least some sperm during their single brief opportunity for mating. The concern is whether it is enough to fertilize their potential egg output; many of those males are small or have par- tially-depleted sperm stores.

Although care is taken in maintaining proper temperature, lighting and feeding regimes for captive experimental animals, other facets of husbandry that can influence experimental results may be overlooked. For example, investigators routinely place ani? mals in whatever size of cage they have at hand that seems remotely reasonable. We questioned whether the size of the cage in relation to the size of the animal may affect physiological variables. We measured 24- hour energy expenditure (V02) and ten day food intake in two species of Peromyscus mice that differed in body size: large Peromyscus californicus (body mass 45-55 g) and small R eremicus (22-26 g). In a two- period cross over study, mice were individu- 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

While V02 and food intake of small mice (P eremicus) were unaffected by cage size, V02 of large mice (P californicus) was less when placed in a small cage compared to a large cage, de? spite the fact that the small cage size was within normal animal care guidelines. Californicus mice also ate less food when housed in small cages, but not enough less to offset their reduced energy expenditure and consequently body mass increased slightly. In large cages, we observed all mice frequently jumping and flipping; small cages did not afford sufficient room for large mice to jump and hence they likely spent more time stationary. Small mice were not similarly constrained. Our data suggest that more care needs to be given to consider? ations of size and type of animal housing, otherwise measurements thought to be un- biased may be reflecting factors other than applied treatments. In our case, choice of cage was unimportant when studying the smaller species, but could skew results for larger mice. 49.1 MUELLER, R.L, Museum of Verte? brate Zoology, UC Berkeley. Who needs a nucleus? Red blood cells in the genus Batrachoseps. Some species of lungless salamanders, family Plethodontidae, have blood contain? ing enucleated red cells. Unlike nearly all mammals, which possess uniformly enucle? ated RBCis, these salamanders have both enucleated and nucleated RBCis present in their circulation at all times. In some cases, the percentage of enucleated red cells is as high as 99%. Despite its unique status among non-mammalian vertebrates, this blood con? dition has been relatively unstudied. Initial reports (Eisen, 1897) of the enucleated con? dition were from two species of Batrachoseps. In recent years, analysis of morphological and molecular data has shown Batrachoseps to be comprised of over twenty species, many as yet undescribed, with high levels of genetic di? vergence. Villolobos et al (1988) examined the blood of four species of Batrachoseps, two from each of the major clades (subgen- era). Their results showed that species now assigned to the subgenus Batrachoseps have a high percentage of enucleated eryth? rocytes, while species of the subgenus Plethopsis have a low percentage of enucle? ated erythrocytes. A full understanding of the evolution of enucleated red cells must start with knowledge of the relative abun? dance of these cells in all extant members of the genus, coupled with a robust phyloge? netic hypothesis. To this end, I examined the blood of ten individuals from each of twenty species. Results for the subgenus Plethopsis agree with previous reports; specimens have low numbers of enucleated cells. However, members of the subgenus Batrachoseps display substantial variation in numbers of enucleated cells. This variation exists both among different species and within a single species, and raises questions of ontogenetic and environmental effects on blood compo? sition.

A hovering hawkmoth Manduca sexta generates a stable leading-edge vortex dur? ing the downstroke. To study the flow in greater detail, a scaled-up robotic model that mimics the wing movements was built (the flapper). The flow around its wings was visualised with neutrally buoyant soap bubbles and mapped using three-dimen? sional particle tracking velocimetry. Our re? cordings confirm earlier findings obtained from qualitative smoke flow visualisation (van den Berg and Ellington, 1997): a coni? cal leading-edge vortexdevelops during the downstroke, with a strong spanwise com? ponent from the wing base to the wing tip. At 75% wing length, the leading-edge vortex bends towards the trailing edge and feeds into the tip vortex. While the vortex is still attached and close to the leading edge its diameter increases five-fold and the spanwise flow accelerates from 1 to 5 ms1. Computational flow fields around a hover? ing hawkmoth (Liu and Kawachi, 1998) sug? gest that late in the downstroke a second 1142 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

The red eared slider turtle, Trachemys scripta, possess temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Previous studies with T. scripta have suggested that steroids, in particular estrogens, may play key roles in the sex determination cascade. Therefore, steroidogenic enzymes involved in the syn? thesis of estrogens are of particular interest. Previously in our laboratory the cDNA for one such steroidogenic enzyme, aromatase, has been cloned and sequenced from T. scripta. Using this sequence data, a PCR- based strategy was employed in the con- struction of an RNA competitor molecule for aromatase. The synthesis of this RNA com? petitor facilitated the development of a quan? titative competitive RT-PCR (QC RT-PCR) for aromatase. In the current study, we have validated and begun utilizing this QC RT- PCR. Preliminary results have shown that: (1) When competitor RNA was added to to? tal RNA extracted from tissues, both co-am- plified. (2) Varying the amount of competitor while leaving the amount of total RNA added to each tube constant results in varying in? tensity in the competitor bands, while the intensity of the endogenous target band re? mains constant. (3) By varying the amount of competitor added to each sample tube, a standard curve of intensity can be gener? ated, by which aromatase expression dur? ing TSD can be quantified. We are now us? ing this QC RT-PCR to examine the expres? sion of aromatase during TSD. QC RT-PCRs are currently being performed on total RNA isolated from adrenal-kidney-gonadal com? plexes taken from embryos incubated at both male and female-producing temperatures (26?C and 31 ?C respectively) at stages 15, 17, 19, and 21 of embryonic development. The results will provide a chronology of aromatase expression during TSD.

Developmentally-regulated fiber-type switching in claw muscles of American lob? ster, Homarus americanus. Fibers in the claw closer muscles un? dergo a developmentally-regulated switch? ing as the isomorphic claws of larvae and juveniles differentiate into the heteromorphic cutter and crusher claws of the adult. Fast- to-slow switching occurs in the presumptive crusher claw and slow-to-fast switching oc? curs in the presumptive cutter claw. This fi? ber switching occurs at the boundary be? tween the central fast-fiber and the periph? eral slow-fiber regions, and thus the switch? ing of a specific fiber is determined by its position within the muscle. We have cloned cDNAs encoding fast-type isoforms of myo? sin heavy chain (fMHC), P75 regulatory pro? tein (P75), and tropomyosin (fTm) and slow- type isoforms (sMHC and sTm^ to use as molecular markers for switching. The expres? sion of myofibrillar protein isoforms during the intermolt cycle was determined using RNA blot analysis and in situ hybridization. Switching fibers were identified as those fi? bers expressing both fast and slow tran? scripts. Switching occurred in the postmolt period, during which accelerated protein turnover facilitates incorporation of newly- synthesized protein into the contractile ap? paratus.

Consistent with this idea, it has been experi? mentally demonstrated that seismic signals are propagated at least an order of magni? tude better than airborne signals between the natural tunnels of the South African Cape mole-rat, Georychus capensis. Indeed, low- frequency seismic signals are generated by foot- and head-drumming in many fossorial rodents. It has been proposed that the "seis? mic communication modality may be the major long-distance communication chan? nel in the evolution of [the mole-rat Spalax] and possibly in subterranean mammals generally". Evidence is accumulating to in? dicate that certain fossorial mammals, as in the case of frogs, may use the auditory sys? tem to detect seismic signals. Geophone and microphone measurements in the sand suggest that the Namib Desert golden mole (Eremitalpa granti namibensis) is able to detect termite colonies and other prey items using seismic cues from distances up to 20 m, presumably aided by its hypertrophied malleus and the low substrate background noise level. We here review the evidence for the use of seismic signals by subterra? nean mammals and discuss putative mecha? nisms underlying their detection. 2.5 NAUEN, J. C *, LAUDER, G. V, Harvard University. Small-scale flow around the finlets and caudal peduncle of free-swimming chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus). The trajectory and speed of flow in the vicinity of the finlets (small fins on the dorsal and ventral body margin anterior to the cau? dal fin) and caudal peduncle of chub mack? erel (Scomber japonicus) swimming steadily in a flow tunnel at 1.2 lengths/s were deter? mined by particle tracking. Small, reflective particles in the water were illuminated by a vertical (xy) or horizontal (xz) light sheet pro? duced by a 5W argon-ion laser; images of the flow were recorded at 250 Hz using a two camera NAC HSV 500 video system. A total of over 800 particles were tracked for at least 12 ms for four tail beats from each of four fish 20 - 24 cm in length. Particles vis? ible in the xz light sheet approximately 3 mm below the ventral body surface were tracked for up to 40 ms, indicating strong horizontal flow. As the tail decelerates, the most poste? rior finlet achieves an angle of attack of at least 20? to incident flow indicating lift pro? duction and vortex formation. In the xy light sheet the trajectory of particles on the left side of the fish above and below the body midline were significantly different when the finlets were present and the tail was decel- erating to the right than when the finlets were absent and the tail was decelerating to the left. On average, when finlets were present and the tail was decelerating to the right the trajectory angle of particles above the body midline decreased from -3 to -10? relative to the horizontal, and the trajectory of par? ticles below the body midline increased from -2 to 16?, indicating the creation of conver? gent flow. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that finlets increase the flow di? rected into the caudal fin vortex, and thus increase the thrust produced by the tail of the swimming mackerel. 4.3 NAUWELAERTS, S. *, AERTS, P, Uni? versity of Antwerp, Belgium. Gait patterns in frog locomotion: why use alternate-leg swim? ming? During terrestrial locomotion, frogs use two different gaits: asynchronous leg move? ments associated with slow crawling bahaviour and synchronous leg movements during fast jumps. In Rana esculenta crawl? ing occurs during feeding, while jumping is used as an escape strategy. We examined whether a similar velocity-dependent gait transition appears in swimming R. esculenta. Typically, swimming frogs propel themselves by kicking both hind limbs simultaneously. Observations of asynchronous leg move? ments in swimming frogs have been re? ported, but usually were assumed to be as? sociated only with directional changes. We demonstrate that alternating-leg swimming is used quite frequently and that it results in a significantly lower velocity to that obtained using synchronous leg movements. This dif? ference is likely to be associated with ener? getic costs. External mechanical costs for asynchronous swimming were only half of those for synchronous swimming at a com? parable speed. However, asynchronous 1144 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="221">swimming at speeds higher then 0.19 m/s was never observed. Although energy re? quirements for asynchronous swimming are lower, at high speeds asynchronous swim? ming is apparently never applied. Possible explanations for this phenomenon are higher inertial energy losses for synchro? nous swimming, but at high speeds jet pro? pulsion and an interaction effect may be? come important. S7.9 NEAR, T.J., University of California, Davis. Phylogeny of the Acanthocephala and insights to the evolution of parasitism. The Acanthocephala are a lineage of obligate helminth parasites of arthropods and vertebrates. Previous phylogenetic investi? gations utilizing ribosomal and protein cod? ing genes indicate that the Acanthocephala is nested within the Rotifera. This is the only major parasitic lineage with an indentified free-living sister-taxon. This recovered phy? logenetic relationship permits critical exami? nation of several hypotheses concerning the evolution of parasitism in metazoans. The hypothesis that the Acanthocephala are modified rotifers has been questioned. The evidence for this hypothesis is reviewed and both total evidence and consensus ap? proaches are utilized in a phylogenetic re- analysis of the extant morphological and molecular data. Potential confounding vari? ables in the phylogenetic analyses are pre? sented. For example, alignment of the 18S rRNA dataset is problematic. The issue of homology assessment is discussed in rela? tion to previous investigations and recogni? tion of rRNA secondary structure. Revised phylogenetic analyses of relationships within Acanthocephala are used to test the validity of recognized taxonomic groups, character evolution within and among lineages, and diversification of hosts and habitats. The re? sults of phylogenetic reanalysis of acantho- cephalan affinities, in relation to the Rotifera, are utilized to examine the evolution of para? sitism in the Acanthocephala. The results from this examination provide a critical test to several long-standing hypotheses con? cerning the evolution of parasitism in meta? zoans.

Twist and snail homologues in the gastropod mollusk Patella vulgata: a new twist for an old gene network? Mesoderm development must have been crucial in the evolution from diploblastic into triploblastic animals. To obtain a reliable in? sight into the evolution of the mesoderm we urgently need information about the molecu? lar control of mesoderm in other phyla. Our group is interested in the molecular aspects of mesoderm formation in Spiralia. As the twist-snail gene network is known to specify mesoderm in a number of animals, it is inter? esting to know whether its function in Spiralia such as Molluscs and Annelids is conserved. As a starting point we chose a primitive gas? tropod mollusk, Patella vulgata. We have obtained two Patella orthologues of Snail, and a fragment of the orthologue of Twist. The results of in situ hybridization experi? ments for Snail are very intriguing, as no dis? tinct mesodermal expression for either of the Snail orthologues has been observed. The pattern we see indicates expression inside the future head region, in the developing mantle folds, and possibly in the developing central nervous system. In situ hybridizations for Twist thus far showed several phases of expression inside the embryo, none of which clearly indicate a role in mesoderm devel? opment. The role of Twist in Patella therefore remains unclear. We conclude that in mol? luscs, and possibly in all Spiralia, the Twist- snail gene network does not function in me? soderm formation, and that the ancestral role of the Snail gene family involves epithelial- mesenchymal transitions and nervous sys? tem development. 800-955-1236 ?

Conserved gene networks in development: the engrailed and Dpp ho? mologues in molluscan shell development. During Drosophila development the Engrailed/hedgehog/decapentaplegic gene network functions in setting up boundaries between different compartments, e.g. be? tween anterior and posterior compartments in imaginal discs. Here, Engrailed is ex? pressed in cells on one side of the border. These cells then secrete the Hedgehog gene product that reaches the other side of the border where it induces the expression of Decapentaplegic (dpp). We are investigat- ing the possible role of this network during the development of the gastropod mollusk Patella vulgata. We have cloned the Patella vulgata homologues of Engrailed and Dpp and analyzed their spatio-temporal expres? sion patterns by in situ hybridization. The Patella engrailed and Dpp genes are ex? pressed at the border between the shell form? ing epithelium and adjacent ectodermal non-shell forming cells, with Engrailed be? ing expressed by the shell forming cells. Pre? vious research in our lab has shown that the cells of the shell forming mantle edge can communicate via gap junctions with each other, but not with surrounding tissue. This shows that there is a communication com? partment boundary between the Patella engrailed and Dpp expressing cells. Inter- estingly, insect imaginal disc compartments are also communication compartments. Our results show that the gene network involv? ing Engrailed and Dpp, has a conserved function between Drosophila, Patella and other animal systems, namely setting up boundaries between developmental com? partments. To further confirm this hypothesis, we have recently isolated a Patella hedge? hog homologue and are investigating its role in setting up this boundary. S7.6 NELSON, DR., East Tennessee State University. Johnson City, Current status of the Tardigrada. The Tardigrada are lobopodous micrometazoans that occupy a diversity of niches in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments throughout the world. Some have a cosmopolitan distribution, while oth? ers are endemic. About 900 species have been described thus far, but many more spe? cies are expected as additional habitats are investigated. Most are less than 1 mm in body length and are opaque or translucent, ex? hibiting colors such as brown, green, orange, yellow, red, or pink in the cuticle and/or gut. Tardigrades are bilaterally symmetrical, with four pairs of legs terminating in claws and/or sucking disks. Marine species are more vari? able in body shape and overall appearance and generally exhibit low populations with high species diversity. Reproductive modes include sexual reproduction and partheno- genesis, but much remains to be known about development. Tardigrades have a fluid-filled body cavity (hemocoel), a com? plete digestive tract, and a dorsal lobed brain with a ventral nerve cord with fused ganglia. Recent molecular analyses and additional morphological studies of the nervous sys? tem have confirmed the phylogenetic posi? tion of tardigrades as a sister group of the arthropods. The ability of tardigrades to un? dergo cryptobiosis has long intrigued scien? tists. Although tardigrades are active only when surrounded by a film of water, they can enter latent states in response to desic? cation (anyhydrobiosis), temperature (cryobiosis), low oxygen (anoxybiosis), and salinity changes (osmobiosis). Cryptobiotic states also aid in dispersal. P3.71 NEPHEW, B.C *, ROMERO, LM, Tufts University Peripheral arginine vasotocin (AVT) increases corticosterone, but de? creases behavior in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). The neurohormone arginine vaso? tocin (AVT) has been shown to have diverse effects on numerous avian behaviors includ? ing vocalization, learning, sexual behavior, aggression, and general activity level. It is unclear whether these effects are modulated by AVT alone, AVT-induced increases in cor? ticosterone concentrations, or by an inter- play of both hormones. To test this relation? ship, AVT was administered peripherally to European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and the ensuing endocrine and behavioral ef? fects were monitored. Four doses of AVT (0.5,1.0, 4.0, 8.0ug) were injected subcuta- 1146 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="223">neously and starling behavior was videorecorded for 55 minutes. AVT caused significant decreases in feeding, drinking, preening, and perch hopping behavior in a dose-dependent manner. In a second ex? periment starlings were injected with 0.5,4.0, and 8.0ug AVT, and 30 minute post-injec- tion blood samples were collected for analy? sis of corticosterone concentrations by ra? dioimmunoassay. Although the 4.0 and 8.0ug doses resulted in elevated corticos? terone concentrations, the 0.5ug AVT dose elicited behavioral effects in the absence of a significant rise in plasma corticosterone concentrations. These results suggest that systemic AVT may gain entry to the brain and act as a potent neurohormone in star? lings independent of its stimulatory role in adrenocorticotropin release. 44.5 NGUYEN, L*, LECLAIR, E.E., DePaul Universit, Ontogenetic expression of Plunc, a mouse marker for selected derivatives of the pharyngeal epithelium. In mammalian development the lung and thymus both form from local expansions of the embryonic gut tube. The thymus arises from ventral elongations of the third pharyn? geal pouch, while the lung tree starts as a ventral outpouching of the foregut. Although the respiratory passages function in breath? ing and the thymus in the maturation of T- cells, both these organs express Plunc, a novel secreted protein, in an unusual pat? tern of epithelial cells. In situ studies show that Plunc is expressed discontinuously in mouse nasal epithelium starting at embry? onic day 14 and continuing into adulthood. Plunc expression in the lungs begins be? tween day 18 and birth and is present in the entire lining of the trachea and the large bronchial passages. Plunc also appears in the embryonic mouse thymus on day 14, with segmental staining of the cells surround? ing the larger medullary venules. Although no function has been proposed for Plunc, similar sequences have recently been cloned from humans, rats and cows, sug? gesting an evolutionary conserved ontoge? netic expression at least within mammals. In support of this we show that human tra- cheobronchial tissue expresses the human homolog Hplunc in a manner similar to that observed in mice. No sequences homolo? gous to Plunc are present in the genomes of Saccharomyces, C. elegans, or Droso? phila, indicating that this gene may play a role in the immune and/or respiratory matu? ration of "higher" animals. We are now as? sessing this role by colocalizing Plunc with lung surfactant proteins and markers of the thymic epithelium, and by evaluating the behavior of overexpressed Plunc in primary tracheobronchial cells in vitro.

Insulin-regulated glucose trans? port in muscle of the goby, Gillichthys mirabilis. In the goby, a total pancreatic endocrine isletectomy (lx) is followed by hyperglyce? mia and several additional symptoms typi? cal of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Insulin treatment of lx gobies nor- malizes serum glucose levels, with a signifi? cant glucose-lowering effect of the hormone observable by as early as 6 hr. In addition, glucose tolerance tests indicate that the lx goby is impaired in its ability to clear glu? cose following injection of 250 mg/kg glu? cose, as compared with that in intact gobies, while injection of insulin significantly en? hances glucose clearance rate. The degree to which these changes in serum glucose may be associated with alterations in pe? ripheral glucose transport was assessed in part by measuring the rate of uptake of the non-metabolizable glucose analog, 3H-2- deoxyglucose, by muscle explants in vitro. Insulin treatment (1 lU/kg) of intact gobies results in a 2-fold greater rate of muscle glu? cose uptake as compared with that of con? trols, while in untreated lx fish it was reduced by half. Furthermore, glucose transport in muscle from lx gobies becomes resistant to direct insulin action in vitro, while insulin- replacement therapy of the lx goby restores this response to normal. These data sug? gest the existence of a functional insulin- regulated glucose transport system in this teleost fish. [Support by NSF grant IBN- 9600783 &amp; NIH grant GM50089].

Bats of the family Phyllostomidae are characterized by considerable dietary diver? sity, which may be reflected in the morphol? ogy of the mandibular symphysis. Symphy- seal outline shapes and biomechanical prop? erties of the symphysis were compared us? ing bone densitometer (CT) scans (midline sagittal sections) of dry skulls. The diets of the 9 species (71 individuals) sampled range from fig specialists to dedicated nectarivores. Eigenshape analysis was performed to quantify symphyseal outline shape. CT sec? tions were digitized and converted PHI* co- ordinates, which were then subjected to a singular value decomposition using the co? variance matrix. Biomechanical properties calculated from bitmap images included cor? tical bone area, area moments of inertia, and angular orientation of the symphysis. Both techniques yield broadly similar (but not iden? tical) results, effectively separating nectarivorous from frugivorous species, with omnivorous species falling intermediately. The second eigenshape factor (E2) is posi? tively correlated with all biomechanical pa? rameters (r = 0.52 - 0.59) and symphyseal orientation (r = 0.75), but other eigenshape factors (E1 and E3) are not well correlated with any mechanical variables or linear mea? surements. Both E2 and mechanical pa? rameters are strongly correlated with palate length/breadth ratios and measures of man? dible size (r = 0.63 - 0.87). When mapped onto published phylogenies, outline shape functions show a relatively strong phyloge? netic signal, while biomechanical properties appear to be associated with finer patterns of dietary and allometric variation. S7.12 NIELSEN, C, University Copenhagen, Zoological Museum. The phylogenetic position of Entoprocta, Ectoprocta, Phoronida and Brachiopoda. Ectoprocts, phoronids and brachiopods are often dealt with under the heading Tentaculata or Lophophorata, sometimes with entoprocts as a more or less closely 1148 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="225">related group. The Lophophorata is pur- ported to be held together by the presence of a "lophophore", a mesosomal tentacle crown with an upstream-collecting ciliary band on monociliate cells. However, the ten? tacle crown of pterobranchs is an identical structure, although its ontogeny is not well documented. On the contrary, the ectoproct tentacle crown carries a ciliary sieving sys? tem with multiciliate cells and the body does not show archimery, neither during ontog? eny nor during budding, so the tentacles cannot be characterized as mesosomal. The entoprocts have tentacles without coelomic canals and with a downstream-collecting ciliary system like that of trochophore larvae and adult rotifers and serpulid and sabellid annelids. Planktotrophic phoronid and bra- chiopod larvae develop tentacles at an early stage, but their ciliary system resembles that of echinoderm and enteropneust larvae. Ectoproct larvae are generally non-feeding, but the planktotrophic cyphonautes larvae of certain gymnolaemates have a ciliary band resembling that if the adults. The entoprocts have typical trochophore larvae and many are feeding with the downstream-collecting ciliary bands. Phoronids and brachiopods are thus morphologically on the deuteros? tome line, probably as the sister group of the "Neorenalia" or Deuterostomia s.str. The en? toprocts are clearly spiralians, although their more precise position has not been deter? mined. The position of the ectoprocts is un- certain, but nothing in their morphology in? dicate deuterostome affinities; certain details in their metamorphosis may point to a rela? tionship with the entoprocts. 48.6 NIEWIAROWSKI, PH. *, ANGILLETTA, Jr., M.J., LEACHE, A.D, PORTER, W.P, Uni? versity of Akron, Akron OH, Indiana State University, Terre Haute IN, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge LA, University of Wisconsin, Madison WI. Phylogenetically- based comparative analysis of life history variation among populations of Sceloporus undulatus. The eastern fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus, is one of the most widely distrib? uted lizards in North America. Across its range, populations display two- to three-fold variation in many life history traits, including age at maturity, adult body size, clutch size, and longevity. Although this variation has been the subject of extensive empirical and theoretical study, comparative analyses of life history variation have been limited by the lack of a population level phylogeny. We used a phylogeny inferred from sequences of mitochondrial DNA to construct indepen? dent contrasts for comparative analyses of 13 widely-distributed populations. Our analy? ses explore patterns of covariation among life history traits predicted by life history theory (e.g., egg size vs.clutch size, reproductive output vs. survival), as well as covariation among life history traits and environmental parameters (e.g., precipitation, temperature, activity season length estimates derived from a biophysical model). Our study represents the first time that life history variation in this species has been interpreted within a rigor? ous phylogenetic framework. Intraspecific, phylogenetically-based comparative stud? ies, like ours, provide insights for develop? ing testable hypotheses about life history evolution and adaptation.

The geometry of meso? derm formation in the direct developer Eleutherodactylus coqui, a frog with big eggs. E coqui is a direct developing frog, which hatches as a froglet without going through a tadpole stage. It develops from a big egg (diameter 3.5mm), much of which forms large yolky cells, which are assumed to have pri? marily a nutritive role. The large fraction of the egg devoted to yolk may affect the geo? metric disposition of germ layer formation in this embryo. To address this question, we investigated mesoderm formation in E coqui and compared it to that of Xenopus laevis (egg diameter 1.3mm). First, we examined the position of prospective mesoderm along the animal-vegetal axis of the egg. Animal and vegetal regions are initially divided by the fourth cleavage furrow, close to the ani? mal pole, unlike in X. laevis, where the ani? mal cells are formed by the third cleavage in a supra-equatorial position.

Although ani? mal cells are small, they form most of the blastocoel roof and make extensive contri? butions to differentiated mesodermal tissues. Second, we performed recombinant analy? sis to examine which regions have meso? derm inducing activity. We combined parts of E coqui blastula or early gastrula with X. laevis animal cap and examined mesoderm differentiation of X. laevis cells. Mesoderm inducing activity was restricted to the mar? ginal or sub- marginal regions in E coqui. Neither the vegetal pole nor the inner veg? etal core, including the blastocoel floor, had activity, although these same regions from X. laevis blastulae induced mesoderm. Our results suggest that mesoderm formation is shifted to more animal and superficial re? gions in E coqui compared to X. laevis. 20.3 NISHIGUCHI, M.K.*, New Mexico State University. Reverse physiological pat? terns between sepiolid squids and their lu? minous bacterial symbionts: host specificity examined from down under. Mutualistic associations between bacte? ria and their eukaryotic hosts have a variety of mechanisms that determine patterns of host specificity among symbionts during in? fection and colonization. Although most symbiotic bacteria are only capable of in- fecting their particular host partner, closely related strains with similar host species have been shown to colonize and persist in other host species. Sepiolid squids (Cephalopoda: Family Sepiolidae) and their bioluminescent bacteria (Genus Vibrio) are one example where symbiotic bacterial strains are capable of infecting similar host species. These dif? ferent symbiotic strains have the same in? fection and colonization behavior as do na? tive strains, but when placed in direct com? petition with one another, the native strain is always dominant. This study examined how symbiotically competent Vibrio fischeri strains isolated from Australian Euprymna tasmanica display dominance for native squid hosts over other equally competent V. fischeri strains isolated from other sepiolid squids. Infection by bacterial symbionts from the monocentrid fish Cleidopus gloriamaris and the loliginid squid Photololigo noctiluca produced a lesser degree of infection, de? spite their presence in the same geographi? cal location. Since previous studies have shown that a similar phenomenon occurs in the sister species ? scolopes (Hawaii), this comparision of both host species exempli- fies the importance of host-symbiont recog? nition in habitats where symbiont composi? tion is dictated by a specific host and not the environment. S3.10/V/SH//C4WA K.C., Northern Arizona University Feeding motor patterns: insights from biomechanical modeling. Biomechanical modeling and empirical studies in my laboratory over the past ten years have produced a number of insights into activation patterns of tongue and jaw muscles during feeding in frogs. One insight from empirical work, confirmed by biome? chanical modeling, is that activation patterns of antagonistic muscles change with body size. For example, in toads, the onset time of the tongue retractor muscles relative to the tongue protractors changes systematically with body size. This occurs because the con? traction and relaxation times of individual muscles are independent of body size, whereas the duration of activation is directly proportional to linear dimensions. As ani? mals grow, the relative onset times of muscles change so that peak force is devel? oped at the same time during the feeding cycle. The implication of such considerations is that neither are muscle activation patterns constant during the lifetime of individuals within a species, nor can they be character? istic of a species as a whole. A second in? sight from biomechanical modeling, which is consistent with a large body of empirical work, is that the genioglossus muscles of frogs, long considered as tongue protrac? tors, are actually an order of magnitude too small to affect the tongue trajectory during protraction. Tongue protraction is dynami- cally stable, and is powered mostly by an? gular momentum transferred from the open? ing jaws to the tongue. Connective tissues in the tongue are designed to resist or per? mit tongue elongation. We hypothesize that 1150 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="227">the genioglossus muscles themselves, rather than powering tongue protraction, may perform some other essential role, such as breaking surface tension between the tongue and the lower jaw. Biomechanical models, coupled with empirical studies, of? ten suggest functional hypotheses that are not intuitively obvious. 61.5 NORCLIFFE, H R. *, WATTS, P, CAR? RIER, D. R., Applied Fluids Engineering, Inc, Applied Fluids Engineering, Inc, University ofUtah, Salt Lake City. Comparative study of human locomotion in microgravity. Because human locomotion evolved with the burden of gravity, locomotion is difficult in space. The absence of significant gravita- tional force could make human flight com- monplace in a space station. To address this possibility, we analyzed mechanisms of animal locomotion applied to an astronaut in a space station. Our analyses indicate that humans could fly, but with relatively poor performance. Acceleration and turning agil? ity would be much less than we are accus- tomed to on Earth, but limits on initial accel? eration could be overcome, in most cases, by pushing-off from solid surfaces. With an initial take-off jump, relatively small wings mounted on the arms would give an astro? naut a capacity to turn and change body ori? entation in a controlled manner. Because we are not structured to flap our arms as birds and bats do, we could produce greater accelerations using various methods of drag- based propulsion. Unfortunately, turning agility with drag-based propulsion would be limited by the intermittent generation of turn? ing forces that is necessitated by the recov? ery stroke. The most versatile system of transport would likely be a space bike that would allow an astronaut to convert the muscular power of the human leg into a di? rected momentum flux of air, albeit with much less effort than needed on earth. Our results yield insight into the effect of gravity on the evolution of viable forms of animal locomo? tion. Our analyses also reinforce the efficient use of rotation by modern engineering.

In the lower Cape Fear River estuary, populations of juvenile (&lt; 12 mm carapace width) blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, are found at low salinity (&lt;5 ppt). This distribu? tion pattern may have ecological benefits, such as predator avoidance, but it also leads to increased metabolic costs associated with ATP-dependent osmoregulation. The osmo? regulatory costs should be particularly high for the smallest animals, which have the highest surface area-to-volume ratio. We hypothesized that the increased metabolic cost of size-dependent osmoregulation at low salinities would be reflected in the activ? ity of enzymes of energy metabolism in the gills. We measured activities of hexokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, glutamate dehydrogenase and hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase as a func? tion of animal size and acclimation salinity. Measurements were made on posterior gills (6 and 7), which are principally involved with osmoregulation, and in anterior gills (3 and 4), which are principally respiratory. Salinity treatments were 7 days acclimation to 5,17 or 34 ppt and four size classes were selected from the smallest juveniles to adults. The data were interpreted both in terms of salin? ity treatment and animal scaling laws. P1.66B NOREN, D.P*, WILLIAMS, T.M., University of California, Santa Cruz. Effects of environmental regime and body condi? tion on resting metabolic rates in northern elephant seal pups: does RMR measured in ambient air represent true RMR? Northern elephant seal pups (Mirounga angustirostris) are weaned at body masses that are 30 - 50% lipid. Due to the wide range of body compositions at weaning, northern elephant seals provide a good model to examine how body condition influ? ences resting metabolic rates (RMR) and thermal conductance under different tem? perature regimes. Percent body lipid (via tritium dilution), RMR (via open flow respirometry), and core body temperature (Tb) were determined in 17 fasting pups rest- 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

We found that percent lipid (range: 34.4% - 43.8%) tended to increase with body mass (range: 62.0 kg -108.0 kg) but was not correlated with RMR. RMR was correlated with total body mass and lean body mass. RMR increased with body mass in air (R = 0.71, P = 0.002) and cold water (R = 0.66, P = 0.004), but not significantly in warm water (R = 0.45, P = 0.068). RMR (range: 293.6 ml02 min1 - 521.7 ml02 min1) differed (P = 0.050) between the three regimes, with the highest mean RMR in warm water and the Iowest RMR in cold water. Furthermore, RMR tended to increase with environmental tem? peratures. Thermal conductance, calculated from RMR and Tb, increased with environ? mental temperature, more steeply in ambi? ent air than in water. These results indicate that body condition and environmental re? gime have synergistic effects on RMR and thermal conductance for resting northern elephant seals. A consequence of large body size and high body lipid content is an elevation in RMR and thermal conductance, particularly when resting in ambient air, with the result that minimum RMR occurs when these mammals are in cold water.

Development of blood oxygen stores in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Increased blood oxygen reserves facili- tate diving in marine mammals. Previous studies show that pinnipeds require a de? velopmental period for blood oxygen stores to reach adult capacities. We investigated if a developmental period for the blood also occurs in cetaceans which unlike pinnipeds, are exposed to diving immediately after birth. Blood samples were collected from bottle? nose dolphins aged 0-12 years from wild and captive populations to determine red blood cell number cell number (RBC), he? moglobin content (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). We found that during postnatal development, RBC, Hb, and Hct decrease from 0-1.5 months and then increase significantly from 1.5-6 months, reaching adult levels by 3 years. MCV and MCH significantly increase from birth until 2 months of age at which time they approximate adult values. MCHC sig? nificantly decreases from 0-3.2 months, then increases and approximates adult values by 6 months. Because weaning occurs at 1.5 years for bottlenose dolphins, the develop? ment of the blood oxygen store is not com? plete with the initiation of independent for? aging. The lower oxygen storage capacity of immature dolphins undoubtedly limits dive capabilities as indicated by aerobic dive lim? its (ADL) calculated from our blood data. ADLs of 0-3 year olds (1.9-4.8 min) are lower than the ADLs of 4-8 and 9-12 year olds (5.1 and 5.4 min, respectively). Increases in ADL from 0 to 3 years are attributed to increases in body mass and mass specific oxygen stores while body mass alone explains the increases in ADL for dolphins 3 to 9 years.

Biology and diversity of delicate, gelati? nous, holopelagic deep-sea organisms con? tinue to be sources of major surprises, de? spite more than a century of studies. Nem? erteans are among the least studied groups of these organisms. Recent collaborative deep-sea mid-water collections made with J. Childress (UCSB) and Monterey Bay Aquarium demonstrated that taxonomic di? versity of holopelagic nemerteans was vastly under-appreciated and that previously stud? ied species were poorly known. One surprise is a pair of epidermal, specialized glandular regions found near the posterior of the body, more or less along the left and right lateral margins, occuring in 13 of our recently col? lected morpho-species. The taxonomic distri? bution of the glandular structures is sugges- tive of a strong phylogenetic correlation, pro? viding some welcome relief in this character- impoverished group of worms. In fact, the 1152 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="229">structures appear to constitute a synapomorphy for Pelagonemertidae and Balaenanemertidae.These glandular struc? tures generally appear as an elongate patch of thickened epidermis comprised of two mostly segregated types of glandular cells, with staining properties suggestive of acid mucins and more proteinaceous mucoids re? spectively. A key attribute of these structures is strong bonding with underlying connective tissue, unlike the rest of the epidermis, which is readily lost in the collecting process. Ho? mology of these structures with a ventral, more complex glandular specialization known pre? viously from Plotonemertes remains to be tested. In the course of our study we found additional regional glandular specialization of epidermis in three other species of pelagic nemerteans; these seem to be non-homolo? gous. Neither structure nor location offer self- evident suggestions for function of these spe? cializations. S10.18 NORRIS, R.D., Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Evolution of photosymbiosis in planktic foraminifera. Photosymbiotic relationships have been established at least seven times between large clades of planktic foraminifera (unicel- lular marine protists) and dinoflagellate au- totrophs in the past 100 million years. Algal symbionts impart a distinct carbon isotope chemistry on the host foraminifera that can be detected even in extinct species. Carbon isotope data show that planktic foraminifer photosymbiosis first evolved in the late Cre? taceous (-75-80 Ma). Photosymbiotic clades were wiped out during the Creta- ceous/Paleogene mass extinction (65 Ma), re-established in a different clade in the middle Paleocene (-61 Ma), eliminated again about 38 Ma and re-established for a third time in four separate subclades of planktic foraminifera starting about 18 Ma. The first two diversifications of the photosymbiotic ecology coincide with those in the host foraminifera and suggest that the establishment of the symbiotic relationship allowed the host group to radiate into nutri- ent-stressed habitats. However, the most re? cent re-acquisition of photosymbiosis oc? curred in a number of different subclades of a group of foraminifera that had begun its radiation 6-8 million years earlier. Hence, although there is some evidence for coevo? lution between planktic foraminifera and their algal symbionts, this is not always the case. Photosymbiosis may allow diversifi? cation into environments where competition is weak and lead to the spread of photosymbiotic groups. However, consid? erable diversity of photosymbiotic taxa can also develop through colonization of an al? ready diverse clade by the algal partner. Clearly the context of radiation is important in determining the macroevolutionary effects of the establishment of symbioses. P2.14A/CW/CK7, J.L.*, TAKIMOTO, R., FOLEY, A.B., BURKE, A.

The somitic mesoderm produces the axial skeleton and the striated muscle of both body and limbs of vertebrates. The limb skeleton and connective tissue develops from cells of the lateral plate mesoderm. To function properly, the elements of the appendicular and axial systems must be coordinated dur? ing development; for instance the limbs need to be in register with regional changes in the vertebral column. This patterning is realized during development as cells from the somites migrate into the lateral plate and differentiate into specific muscles. There is a boundary that separates the dorsal compart? ment (somitic cells only) from the ventral compartment (somitic and LP cells) that we call the somitic f rontier. Previous experiments in avian embryos have shown that somitic mesoderm forming structures in the dorsal compartment of the body (axial skeleton, paravertebral muscles, dorsal dermis) is in- trinsically patterned, i.e. it maintains its axial, morphological identity despite transplanta? tion to a new anterior-posterior (AP) axial address. Furthermore, Hoxgene expression is also maintained in transplanted tissue, strengthening the correlation between Hox gene activity and AP patterning of axial tis? sues.

Chemical cues and vulner? able hosts: an investigation into factors af? fecting settlement of Loxothylacus texanus, a rhizocephalan barnacle parasitizing portunid crabs in the Gulf of Mexico. The parasitic castrator, Loxothylacus texanus, stunts the growth and inhibits re? production of economically important portunid crabs in the Gulf of Mexico where prevalence has been reported to be higher than 50% in some localities. Data from ex? periments utilizing lectins and specific sugars as inhibitors indicate that mannose in/on postmolt exoskeleton plays an im? portant role in the recognition signal used by the barnacle to identify vulnerable hosts. Enhanced settlement occurred on postmolt exoskeleton that had been treated with chloroform to remove lipids suggesting that lipids may serve to mask the recognition signal. Removal of pro? teins from substrates by the action of Pro? teinase K, on the other hand, did not affect settlement. Settlement did occur under laboratory conditions on exoskeleton from species of decapods not known to be in? fected by the parasite. The latter data sug? gest caution before using rhizocephalans as biological control agents as has been proposed by others. P2.49 O'BRYANT, E.L *, WADE, J, Michigan St. University Sexual dimorphisms in neuro? muscular junction morphology in the green anole lizard. The green anole lizard exhibits seasonal courtship behavior that is sexually dimor? phic. It consists of the extension of a bright red throat fan, called a dewlap, along with head-bobs and a push-up display. While males extend the dewlap in aggressive en? counters as well as in courtship, females use their diminutive dewlap much less fre- quently, and in agonistic encounters only. In parallel, a number of components of the neuromuscular system controlling dewlap extension are sexually dimorphic during the breeding season. For example, length of the second ceratobranchial cartilage (which bows out to extend the dewlap), dewlap mo? toneuron soma size, as well as dewlap muscle fiber size and number are all greater in males than in females. In the present study, intact males and females were sacri- ficed during the breeding season and the dewlap muscle and surrounding cartilage pieces (ceratohyal and first ceratobranchial) were extracted and post-fixed for 1 hr. The length of the muscle was measured in two dimensions: (1) along fibers between the two cartilage pieces, and (2) along the muscle parallel to them. The muscle was then stained for acetylcholinesterase to visualize neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) on the fi? bers. The cross-sectional area and density of NMJ were then measured for each ani? mal. NMJ were on average larger in males than in females (p=.022), but their density along each fiber was equivalent between the sexes (p=.094). In addition, the length of the overall muscle (p&lt;.0001), but not indi? vidual muscle fiber length (p=.372) was larger in males than in females. These re? sults are consistent with the idea that en? hanced NMJ size either facilitates or is a consequence of increased use of a larger dewlap in breeding males compared to fe? males.

Exploring the possibility of low- frequency seismic communication in el? ephants and other large mammals. As an elephant vocalizes with low fre? quency rumbles, a signal replica is propa- gated in the ground. Using seismic model? ing, we estimated that the elephant rumbles that we recorded could potentially travel up to 16.7 km in the ground and foot stomps from a mock charge could possibly travel up 1154 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="231">to 32 kilometers. To determine if elephants can detect these seismic signals, we con? ducted seismic playback experiments with African and Asian elephants. Previously re? corded seismic components of particular elephant vocalizations were played back through two specially adapted 50 W seis? mic transmitters at 10 m distances from the elephant. A TEAC digital recorder provided the signal source for the transmitters. Play? back signals and elephant responses were recorded close to the elephant on aTASCAM 2-channel digital recorder through a 20 Hz Mandrel geophone and Neumann low fre? quency microphone. Real time monitoring on a laptop using SpectraPLUS software en- sured signal integrity, without coupling into the air. To assess detection of seismic sig? nals, elephant behavior was monitored through video and visual observations. We are also investigating organs of interest on the elephant's head and feet as candidates for special seismic and auditory sensitivity. If elephants detect seismic components of their vocalizations, communication may be possible at greater distances than previously thought. The results of this study may have significant implications for elephant long dis? tance communication and a better under? standing of elephant audition. Possible seis? mic communication in other large mammals such as lions and bison is also discussed. 12.2 O'CONNOR, M.P*, ZIMMERMAN, LC, SPOTILA, J.R., Drexel University, Uni? versity of Nevada, Reno, Drexel University. Effects of behavior, physiology, and habitat on thermoregulation in desert tortoises. Desert tortoises are herbivorous ecto? thermic denizens of the Mojave and Sonoran deserts whose thermal ecology constrains activity and resource acquisition on both seasonal and daily time scales. We used behavioral observations of individual tortoises with temperature sensitive teleme- ters, operative temperature models, and re? cently developed analytic techniques to es? timate both operative and available body temperatures to study the thermal ecology of f ree-ranging tortoises near Las Vegas, NV We particularly addressed the roles of habi? tat and microhabitat choices, thermal inertia (due to relatively large body size), and the physiological control of heating and cooling in controlling body temperatures. Analyses of available operative temperatures sug? gested that thermal constraints on activity varied both seasonally and day-to-day. They also reveal a role for burrow use as a ther? mal refugium and a possible role for selec? tion among surface microhabitats in control? ling body temperatures. Microsites under shrubs warmed significantly slower than other microhabitats. Contrary to a priori pre? dictions, sites near, but not under, shrubs were often among the hottest available sites. Much of the microsite-based diversity in op? erative temperature occurred during the hot? test parts of the day when tortoises could not be active, but some diversity was available at times when tortoises were active. Both observations of telemetered tortoises and body temperatures predicted from operative temperatures using a model of heating and cooling in tortoises support an important role for the tortoise's thermal inertia in buffering body temperatures from rapidly rising and falling operative temperatures. The role and importance of physiological control of warm? ing and cooling is much less clear. P^.B50'CONNOR, T.P.*, GIBBS, CL, KUROIWA, K, City College of New York, CUNY Effect of cold-acclimation on house finch metabolism and organ sizes. Two of the most intensively studied pro? cesses in the field of ecological physiology are the limits to metabolic performance and the energetics of temperature acclimation. A major emphasis currently is the examina? tion of relationships among basal metabolic rate (BMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR), and the sizes of vital organs and tissues such as kidneys, liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. We examined these relationships in house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) that were maintained in the laboratory at two different acclimation temperatures. Birds in the cold-acclimation (CA) group were main? tained at 5/C, and those in the warm-accli- mation (WA) control group at 25/C, for six weeks following capture in New York in June. All metabolic rate values were measured as oxygen consumption in an open-circuit 800-955-1236 ? (703)790-1745 ? Fax: (703) 790-2672 ? www.SICB.org 1155</page><page sequence="232">respirometry system. MMR was determined by two methods for each animal: exercise maximum in a running wheel chamber and thermogenic maximum during exposure to cold temperatures in a helium-oxygen (heliox) atmosphere. The body mass of CA birds (20.1 ?0.5 g) was significantly greater (p&lt;0.001) than that of WA birds (18.4?0.3 g). Even when adjusted for differences in body mass, the BMR of CA birds was 15% greater than that of WA individuals (p&lt;0.01). How? ever, there was no effect of acclimation tem? perature on either exercise or cold-induced MMR. Exercise-induced MMR values were 17.5% greater than those obtained using the heliox protocol (p&lt;0.01). The relationships among organ sizes and metabolic measure? ments will be discussed.

Many aquatic turtles can successfully capture elusive aquatic prey but few, if any, approach the abilities of the South Ameri? can matamata (Chelus fimbriatus). The goal of this project is to use high-speed videography, fluoroscopy and anatomical dissection to gain a better understanding of the exceptional suction feeding abilities of Chelus. Unlike most turtles, the skull of Chelus is dorsoventrally flattened and the distal half of the mandible is reduced to a thin rod of bone. Unlike any other turtle, Chelus possess no lateral gape when the mouth is open; a large flap of skin unfolds at the angle of the gape and restricts the circu? lar mouth opening to a single plane. The hy? oid skeleton is large relative to similar sized individuals of other species and very robust, functioning as a four-bar linkage system to expand the pharynx both ventrally and lat- erally in response to posteriorly directed forces generated by the M. rectus cervicus. In addition to its many morphological pecu- liarities, the strike of Chelus is much faster than that of any other turtle for which data are currently available (peak gape in 10-15 ms for individuals with 13 cm carapace length). The combination of this unique suite of characters adds up to exceptional suction feeding abilities at the apparent expense of biting performance. The combination of a such an extremely flattened skull with an at- tenuated mandible, results in Chelus being effectively incapable of biting.

Mul? tiple lines of evidence support the indepen? dent origin of an arthropod compound eye. One of the most debated issues in ar? thropod evolution is whether compound eyes evolved once or multiple times. One reason this issue has remained unresolved is that most previous researchers have relied on single lines of evidence. Here I present four separate lines of evidence that the com? pound eyes of ostracod crustaceans are in- dependently derived. The first evidence is phylogeny. Myodocopids - the only ostra? cods with compound eyes - are phyloge? netically nested within several groups that lack compound eyes. Sequence analyses of 28S and 18S rDNA unequivocally sup? port this result. Second, I have documented a recent duplication of visual pigment genes (opsins) coupled with a change to com? pound eye-specific gene expression. The timing of these events are coincident with the origin of myodocopids and therefore the putative origin of ostracod compound eyes. The recent origin of a compound eye-spe? cific opsin is especially eompelling because I cannot detect any other compound eye- opsins in ostracods with older origins. The ancestral absence of compound eye opsins suggests an ancestral absence of com? pound eyes themselves because all meta? zoan eyes express opsin. Third, one would expect a unique structure in independently derived organs. The ultrastructure of the fac- ets of ostracod compound eyes deviates from the common arthropod structure of eight retinular cells and four crystalline cone cells. Ostracods have six and two, respectively. Finally, the oldest known fossil ostracod with a compound eye is also the oldest myodocopid. No fossil compound eyes are known from ostracods older than 1156 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="233">myodocopids. Taken together, these data provide the strongest case yet for the mul? tiple origin of arthropod compound eyes. 9.5 ODELL, J.R*, CHAPPELL, M.A, Uni? versity of California, Riverside. Variation in aerobic capacity within and among "com- mon-garden" populations of trinidadian gup? pies (Poecilia reticulata) from different pre? dation regimes. We measured maximal oxygen uptake rates (V02max) in laboratory-reared F2 and F3 offspring of Trinidadian guppies from four different streams. These streams represent habitats that differ in predation intensity and flow characteristics, and contain guppies that have evolved significantly different life his? tories. Guppies were exercised in a small closed chamber at increasing speeds until they began sprinting. Control experiments demonstrated that the exercise protocol caused elevated whole-animal lactate lev? els, and did not cause hypoxic conditions in the chamber. We found that V02max in gup? pies was a repeatable trait when measured over one-week and three month intervals, although the correlation between measure? ments decreased over time. Within popula? tion variation in V02max ranged between 10 and 13% when the effect of body mass was removed by regression. Within streams, aerobic performance did not differ between the sexes. Male performance was not sig? nificantly different among locales; however, female performance was highly variable among streams. In addition, our data sug? gest a significant effect of stream predation level on female performance. Elucidating the evolutionary forces for the observed dif? ferences in female performance requires further study of more stream pairs. In light of recent studies showing rapid evolution of life-history traits in wild guppies, it is of note that this selection regime does not appear to affect male aerobic performance. 20.4 OKAMURA, B.*, ANDERSON, CL, CANNING, E.U., University of Reading, Reading, U.K, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medici, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medici. An ancient clade of myxozoans parasitic in freshwater bryozoans. The Myxozoa, an enigmatic group of en- doparasites, is marked by a long history of phylogenetic and taxonomic uncertainty. Originally classified as protists, it is now clear that myxozoans are proper metazoans, al? though controversy remains as to whether they are highly degenerate triploblasts or diploblasts. In addition, taxonomic revision was required when it was discovered that certain myxozoan parasites of worms go on to infect fish, thus uniting within one life cycle, forms that were previously assigned to sepa? rate classes. This discovery led to the de- mise of the Class Actinosporea leaving a single class, the Myxosporea, in the phylum. Recently we have described two myxozoan species that occur as parasitic sacs within the body cavity of freshwater bryozoans (Class Phylactolaemata). Comparisons of morphologies and life cycles have revealed major differences between these bryozoan parasites and the myxozoan parasites of fish and worms. Phylogenetic analysis of 18S rDNA sequences identities two clades within the Myxozoa that diverged early in the evo? lution of the group. Our studies suggest that bryozoans may have been ancestral hosts of myxozoans and provide the basis for iden- tifying a new class of myxozoans, the Malacosporea. Finally, our discovery of the bryozoan parasite, Tetracapsula bryo- salmonae, has identified the source of the causative agent of Proliferative Kidney Dis? ease, a devastating disease of salmonid fish? eries resulting from accidental infection by a previously unknown myxozoan. 36.5 OUVER,SJ.*, LOBEL, P.S., Boston University Marine Program.

Only the acoustic call repetition rate was signifi? cantly correlated to male mating success. Previous work on damselfish suggests that call repetition rate is indicative of energetic reserves, which was reflected in higher qual? ity paternal care of eggs. This suggests males are advertising their available energy as an indication of the quality of paternal care they are likely to provide to eggs. We examine this data with reference to prevail? ing theory, particularly the good genes ver? sus good parent process hypotheses of sexual selection. P2.12 OLSON, WM *, HALL, B.K., Dalhousie University, Halifax, N.S. Heart morphogen? esis and neural crest cell migration in cardia bifida chick embryos. During normal development, cardiac neural crest cells migrate from their position over the neural tube, through the pharyn- geal region and into the heart, where they contribute to the septation of the heart and outflow tract, as well as to the cardiac valves and great vessels. The primitive heart tube of higher vertebrates is the result of migra? tion and fusion of bilateral cardiac primordia along the ventral midline of the embryo. Cardia bifida, or "split hearts" can be induced by cutting the anterior intestinal portal (AIP) early in development, thus preventing fusion of the heart primordia. Bifid embryos pos- ses two lateral hearts instead of one me? dian, and pharyngeal development is dis? rupted. In vitro methods, in which embryos were cultured ventral side up on thin albu? min, produced cardia bifida (100%), but did not allow development past ST 11. Cultur? ing the embryos on semisolid medium (1:1 aganalbumin) permitted development to ST 16. In ovo techniques, in which the AIP was cut either from the lateral dorsal side of the embryo or by cutting straight through the dorsal midline, proved less successful at pro? ducing bifida (up to 50%), but prolonged survival until ST 24. No completely bifid em? bryos survived past ST 17. HNK-1, a neural crest marker, was used to analyze whether migration of the cardiac crest is altered in cardia bifida embryos. Initial results sug? gest that the distribution of HNK-1 positive cells is similar in experimental, sham, and undisturbed embryos, with the following ex- ceptions. Starting at stage 16, experimental embryos show transverse streams of posi? tive cells crossing the dorsal hindbrain; in ST 16-20, HNK-1 is limited to the proximal regions of the pharyngeal arches and does not extend as far distally as in the non-ex- perimental groups. S9.8 ORCHINIK, M. *, BREUNER, C, GAS- SER, P, JENNINGS, D, Arizona State Uni? versity. Diversity and plasticity in corticoster- oid action. Stressor-induced increases in plasma corticosteroid (CORT) levels produce many physiological and neurochemical responses that serve, in large part, to facilitate appro? priate behavioral responses to imminent threats. The behavioral responses to CORT are varied, being time-, context- and spe? cies-specific. Comparative studies can pro? vide insights into how a diversity of CORT receptor mechanisms, involving neuronal membranes, ligand-activated transcription factors in neuronal cytosol, and plasma cor? ticosteroid binding globulins (CBG), contrib? utes to the diversity of behavioral responses. Neuronal membrane-associated receptors appear to produce rapid changes in the pro? cessing of sensory or environmental infor? mation leading to acute behavioral transi? tions. Between species, the affinities of these receptors for CORT appears to be inversely related to basal circulating levels of corti? costerone, making these receptors particu? larly well suited for responding to stress lev? els of CORT. The context specificity of rapid CORT action appears to be related to mem? brane receptor-mediated signaling mecha? nisms, particularly the pathways regulated by behaviorally relevant neuropeptides. Seasonal differences in behavioral sensi? tivity to stressors may be mediated not only by seasonal differences in CORT release, but by seasonal plasticity in the number CORT receptors in neuronal membranes and/or neuronal cytosol. Additional factors in the plasticity of CORT action are the poorly understood interaction of CORT with CBGs and the potential signaling activity of CBG. CBG, which regulates the circulating levels 1158 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="235">of free CORT, is regulated by multiple fac? tors in nonmammalian species including season, gonadal steroids, and social status. In several nonmammalian species, "CBGs" bind androgens with at least as high affinity as they bind CORT. Therefore, the binding of CORT and androgens to the same molecule may reciprocally regulate the relative con? centrations of free steroids, and this may be especially significant during a stress re? sponse. In order to understand the adaptive and deleterious actions of CORT, we need to consider the dynamics and plasticity of corticosteroid interaction with plasma, neu? ronal membrane, and intracellular binding sites. 49.3 OWERKOWICZ, T*, BRAINERD, E. L, CARRIER, D. R., Harvard University, Cam? bridge, MA, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, University of Utah, Salt Lake City. Electromyographic pattern of the gular pump in monitor lizards. Gular pumping has recently been shown to play an important role in lung ventilation of monitor lizards but its evolutionary origin has not yet been investigated. To compare this mechanism with the amphibian buccal pump, we studied the activity of throat muscles during gular pumping in savannah monitors (Varanusexanthematicus). We im- planted bipolar electrodes in hyobranchial muscles, and recorded their firing patterns in synchrony with kinematic, airflow and pres? sure profiles of the gular pump. The monitor throat is supported by a highly mobile hyoid apparatus, the unfolding and folding of which produces large volume air flows into and out of the gular cavity. Mm. sternohyoideus and branchiohyoideus expand the gular cavity, whereas mm. constrictor colli, intermandibularis and mandibulohyoideus compress it. Closure of the choanae by sub- lingual plicae precedes gular compression, thus allowing positive pressure to be gener? ated in the gular cavity and air to be forced into the lungs. The gular pump is found to exhibit a neuromotor pattern identical to the buccal pump of extant amphibians, and both mechanisms involve homologous muscles. This suggests that the gular pump of moni? tor lizards may derive from the buccal pump of basal tetrapods. Whether it does remains to be determined by mapping gular pump? ing as a character on the squamate phylog? eny. 67.5 PABST, DA.*, KOOPMAN, H.N., ROMMEL, S.A., POTTER, CW, READ, R.J, MCLELLAN, W.A., University of North Caro? lina, Wilmington, Duke University, Florida Marine Research Institute, Smithsonian In- stitution. Ontogenetic allometry and body composition of harbor porpoises Phocoena phocoena from the Western North Atlantic. North Atlantic harbor porpoises face con? siderable energetic challenges, as they are relatively small mammals with an intense reproductive schedule and a cold-water habitat. We describe post-natal growth of porpoises using ontogenetic allometry and body composition techniques. Our sample contained robust calves, immature, and mature porpoises (n=122) killed in fishing operations from 1992-98. Total mass and masses of 26 body components were mea? sured using a standard dissection protocol. Most body components grew similarly in fe? male and male porpoises. Blubber, brain and skull grew negatively allometrically; muscle and reproductive tissues grew posi? tively allometrically. Female heart, liver, in- testines and mesenteric lymph node grew significantly faster than in males. Male loco? motor muscle and pelvic bones grew signifi? cantly faster than in females. High growth rates for visceral and reproductive organs in porpoises, relative to other mammals, may underlie their early maturation and support their annual reproductive schedule. Rela? tive to other cetaceans, porpoises invest a larger percentage of their body mass in blub? ber. This large investment in blubber, which is highest in calves (37% of body mass), may provide small-bodied porpoises the thermal insulation required to live in cold, north At? lantic waters. The factors influencing growth rates and differential investments in body composition, thus, appear to change at vari? ous stages of a porpoise's life. Energetic in? vestment in porpoises shifts from an empha? sis on developing an insulative blubber layer in young animals to preparing the body for reproduction by the point of maturity. 800-955-1236 ?

Comparative kinematics of the forelimb during swimming in red-eared slider and spiny softshell turtles. In freshwater turtles the hindlimb typically has been viewed as the primary propulsive organ during swimming. However, in highly aquatic softshell turtles, extensive webbing is present between the digits of the hand as well as the foot, suggesting that the forelimb may also serve as an effective paddle for generating drag-based thrust in these spe? cies. To test whether forelimb movements in softshells also were consistent with a role in thrust production, we measured the three- dimensional swimming kinematics of the forelimb in spiny softshell turtles (Apalone spinifera) from digital video and compared these data with similar measurements from red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta), turtles that frequently travel on land and do not pos? sess webbed front feet. Several aspects of forelimb kinematics differ significantly be? tween these species. In general, the limb segments move in a nearly horizontal plane throughout the stroke in softshells, but in slid? ers the humerus is raised as much as 30/ above the horizontal during protraction be? fore slicing down ventrally through the wa? ter during retraction. Peak elbow extension during the power stroke is nearly 50/ greater in softshells than in sliders; in addition, the forefoot is oriented perpendicular to water flow through nearly all of forelimb retraction in softshells, but only through the middle third of retraction in sliders. As a result of these latter factors, softshells maintain a much larger surface area than sliders for drag- based propulsion with the forelimbs. Thus, the forelimbs could make much more sub? stantial contributions to forward thrust dur? ing swimming in highly aquatic softshell turtles than in more generalized turtles like sliders.

En? vironmentally induced variation in size and condition of hatchling painted turtles. We manipulated the contents of newly constructed nests of painted turtles (Chrysemyspicta) so that each of three nests received two eggs from each of the same five females. The manipulation was repli? cated on three successive days, thereby yielding a sample of nine nests and 15 clutches. The eggs then were allowed to incubate in the field for 54-56 days before they were brought into the laboratory to com? plete incubation at an optimal temperature and water potential. Both clutch and nest contributed significantly to variation in size and condition of hatchlings. Embryos in eggs that absorbed water from the nest en? vironment mobilized more of the lipid and protein from their yolk and grew larger be? fore hatching than did embryos in eggs that lost water to the surroundings. The relatively large hatchlings contained more storage lipid than did smaller animals, but the lipid reserve scaled with body size. Our findings point to an important role for water in modu? lating the metabolism and growth of embry? onic turtles developing under natural condi? tions in the field.

We placed hatchling painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) individually into pint-vol- ume canning jars containing damp soil or artificial pond water and then exposed the animals to 4?C in a simulated hibernation lasting 70 days. Our goal was to gain new insight into why baby painted turtles remain inside the natal nest for the first winter of their life and thereby expose themselves to potentially lethal conditions of ice and cold. The usual explanation for this behavior holds that hatchlings remaining in their nest over the winter minimize their exposure to preda? tors at a time of year when the potential for growth is low. However, few of the turtles in our experiment survived 70 days of immer- sion in pond water whereas all the animals survived for 70 days in soil. Hatchlings in pond water may have succumbed to osmo- ionic imbalance, insufficiency of gas ex? change, or some unidentified factor.

Dinosaurian life history strategies: evidence of differential growth rates from bone histology. Dinosaurs, like other tetrapods, grew more quickly shortly after hatching than later in life. However, they did not grow like other non-avian reptiles, slowing their trajectory gradually in a convex are through ontogeny. Rather, dinosaurs (especially large ones) grew to their adult size relatively quickly, much like large birds and mammals do to? day. Some large duckbills took only seven years to reach seven meters in length; some large sauropods may have taken only a de? cade to reach full size. Gigantic crocodiles of the past, in contrast, grew along the growth trajectory of living crocodiles, but simply ex? tended and attenuated the growth curve. They may have taken several decades to reach tens of meters in length. Large ptero? saurs apparently grew much like large birds and other large dinosaurs. But small ptero? saurs and some small dinosaurs apparently grew at slower rates after hatching, compa? rable to fast-growing rates in crocodiles, judg- ing from bone tissue structure and vascular- ization. Theropod (carnivorous) dinosaurs seem to have grown very quickly from their early evolution, regardless of size. The first birds apparently slowed growth rates but maintained shape trajectory to produce a smaller adult size; only later in avian history was small size attained quickly. 7.6 PADILLA, D.K., DILGER, E.K., DITTMANN, D.E., SUNYStony Brook, Ward Melville High School, USGS/Tunison Labo? ratory of Aquatic Science. Phenotyic plastic? ity of feeding structures in species of Littorina. Several species of gastropods in the ge? nus Lacuna, Family Littorinidae, have been found to have phenotypically plastic feed? ing morphologies. Animals fed different di? ets produce different shaped radular teeth. When fed diatom epiphytes found on eel- grass, snails produce blunt-shaped teeth. When fed macroalgae (kelps, ulvoids, or bladed red algae) they produce pointed- shaped teeth. Experiments were performed with three species of Littorina, with different development patterns, to see if they would respond in a similar fashion as Lacuna. Littorina littorea has plaktotrpohic develop? ment, Littorina obtusata lays benthic egg masses and has crawl away juveniles, and Littorina saxatilis is viviporous. We fed indi? viduals of each species one of two diets, either diatom epiphytes or the green alga, Ulva lactuca, for 6 weeks and then exam? ined their radulae. For each individual we deteremined the shape of the theeth on the anterior (older) portion of the radula and the posterior (younger) portion. Differences in tooth shape along the length of the radula of an individual was used to determine if tooth morphology was phenotypically plastic. We found that two species were phenotypically plastic, but the third was not. Of the two spe? cies that were plastic, only one showed a significantly different response to diet. 63.1 PAGE, L.R., UniversityofVictoria.The apical sensory organ of gastropod larvae: new data on a patellogastropod.

Testosterone and es? trogen act via different pathways to inhibit pu? berty in male Siberian hamsters. Testosterone (T), dihydrotestos-terone (DHT), and 17b-estradiol (E) induce testicu? lar regression in peripubertal, male, Sibe? rian hamsters, Phodopus sungorus. Since T can be converted to DHT or E, whether T acts directly or through its metabolites to in? hibit gonadal development is not known. The purpose of this study was: 1) to determine if T, DHT, and E have differential effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG); and 2) to determine if peripubertal hamsters show a change in sensitivity to T inhibition following the pubertal transition. In Experi? ment 1, pre-pubertal hamsters were im- planted with a capsule containing crystal? line T, DHT, E, or cholesterol (Ch). After 15 days, blood, hypothalami, pituitaries, and testes were collected. In experiment 2, pre- pubertal animals were implanted with T or Ch, castrated at 35-days of age, and implant was removed at 45-days of age. The im? plant was replaced 5 (Group A) or 10 (Group B) days post implant removal. Results from Experiment 1 showed E significantly reduced pituitary FSH content but not T or DHT. Plasma FSH content was undetectable in T and DHT groups but E-treated animals were similar to controls. Experiment 2 showed that plasma FSH levels were undetectable in T-treated animals until implant removal. FSH levels rise significantly as early as 1- day post-implant removal. Plasma FSH was undetectable following re-implantation in Group A, whereas they remained signifi? cantly higher in Group B. Taken together, our data showed that T and E act via differ? ent pathways to inhibit the HPG axis during pubertal maturation in the male Siberian hamster. Further, a decrease in the sensitiv? ity to T-induced HPG inhibition occurred dur? ing a defined period immediately after the peri-pubertal transition.

A peculiar feature of certain non-mam? malian cynodonts is their broad, overlapping ribs. Galesaurus and Thrinaxodon have broadened ribs in both thoracic and lumbar regions, though the details of morphology vary along the trunk. In the past, Galesaurus has been reconstructed as having the same pattern of rib morphology as occurs in the better-known genus Thrinaxodon. Cynodont specimens BP/1/3911 and BP/1/4506 at the Bernard Price Institute, South Africa, reveal features in the mid-dorsal and lumbar ribs of Galesaurus that clearly distinguish them from the ribs of Thrinaxodon. Mid-dorsal ribs of Galesaurus have a caudally-projecting lobe of bone approximately as long as it is wide, whereas mid-dorsal ribs of Thrinaxodon have a projecting shelf of bone that is trans- versely wider than long. The lumbar ribs of Galesaurus are expanded cranio-caudally, with a roughly oval shape in lateral view. The lumbar ribs of Thrinaxodon are less elon? gated cranio-caudally, with a roughly square shape in lateral view. The presence of dis? tinct variation in rib morphology between these two genera indicates that among non? mammalian cynodonts, ribs may be of use in (1) identification of skeletons when the skull is incomplete or missing, (2) phyloge? netic analyses, and (3) functional interpre? tation of axial skeleton evolution. 1162 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

Because they share a large number of morphological characters, living marine turtles (Chelonioidea) are thought to have evolved from a single ancestor. All chelonioids share paddle-like limbs, a re? duced shell, and peculiar arterial perfora- tions of the braincase. However, compara? tive studies of distantly related clades that inhabit marine or open waters shows that many of these characters are correlated to ecology and mode of locomotion. For ex? ample, besides chelonioids, the living Carettochelys is the only other turtle with a symmetrical underwater flight stroke and it shares many limb characters considered synapomorphies of marine turtles. Further? more, the phylogenetic analyses of long-ne- glected Asian fossils shows that many of the other characters are actually primitive - lost by other living turtles, but retained in chelonioids. Taken together, these data east doubt on the hypothesis of monophyly. An independent line of evidence for multiple ori? gins is the first appearances of marine turtle clades in the fossil record. Marine sediments preserve the pulses of separate radiations as morphologically primitive turtles became more specialized and diverse. The timing of these appearances is congruent with a mul? tiple origin hypothesis because some puta? tive sister taxa are separated by about 50 million years. Finally, when marine-related characters are removed, the morphology of the primitive members of these groups cor? responds to the morphology of coeval ter? restrial lineages. The turtle bauplan is gen? erally conservative, and the interaction of hy- drodynamic and ontogenetic factors may have contributed to similar iterations of char? acter complexes in marine turtles. 66.4 PARHAM, J.F.*, SIMISON, W.B., KOZAK, K.H., FELDMAN, CR, University of California at Berkeley, University of Califor? nia Museum of Paleontology, University of Washington at St. Louis, University of Wash? ington at St. Louis. A reassessment of some recently described Chinese turtles. Over the past 16 years, herpetologists de? scribed 13 new species of turtles. Most of these are based on specimens purchased from the pet trade. Herpetologists collected only two of these species, the rest have not been observed in the areas and habitats in which they were reported to occur. Questions have been raised about the validity and conservation of these rare and putatively endangered turtles. We used mitochondrial DNA and allozyme elec? trophoresis to test the validity of two of these new species (Mauremys iversoni and Cuora serrata). Both lines of evidence support the idea that these turtles are intergeneric hybrids. This hypothesis is consistent with the morphol? ogy of these turtles, which is intermediate be? tween the two genera. Serious issues remain. Other "new" turtle species require intensive in? vestigation: Whereas some are probably valid species worthy of conservation, others may be turtle farm hybrids. The parent species of Mauremys iversoni are common in turtle farms, and the accidental production of this "species" has been documented. But the parent species of C. serrata are not farmed. In fact, the latter may be a naturally occurring hybrid. We can? not assume that all the hybridization is an- thropogenic, but how do we separate natu? ral hybridization from husbandry? The abil? ity of turtles to hybridize readily is well docu? mented. Could reticulation be a common source of new species in turtle evolution? New observations from China suggest that most of the new "species" are artifically pro? duced. P2.26 PARK, DS. *, PROPPER, C. R., North? ern Arizona University, Flagstaff. Purification and action of a repelling pheromone from male red-spotted newts. Male red-spotted newts, Notopthalmus viridescens, interacting with females release repelling pheromones that function to repel conspecific males. It has suggested that the repelling pheromones may conserve both the courting and approaching (towards a courting group) males' reproductive fitness by controlling the sex ratio within the court? ing arena. Using behavioral bio-assays, col- umn-chromatography, and SDS-PAGE, we have begun to purify the repelling phero? mone.

Developmental changes of Blastema and Proteinase activi? ties during earthworm tail regeneration. Developmental Changes of Blastema and Proteinase Activities during Earthworm Tail Regeneration Sung Jin Cho, Myung Sik Lee, Pyo Hyun Cho and Soon Cheol Park Department of Life Science, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756, Korea Although the earthworm is an important animal spe? cies capable of regenerating missing body part, earthworm regeneration is not well un? derstood at the tissue, cell and molecular levels. In order to understand the develop? mental changes of blastema and the signifi? cance of proteinase activity during earth? worm tail regeneration, the formation and development of blastema and the charac? teristics of proteinases induced during re? generation were investigated by histologi? cal and zymographic analysis. By histologi? cal observation, we have identified that a major origin of earthworm blastemal cells is the longitudinal muscle layer of body wall. Blastema formed beneath wound dermis was segmented and then redifferentiated. Zymographic analysis of proteinase re? vealed that at least four types of proteinases were induced during tail regeneration, which had molecular weight of 25, 28, 38, and 44 kDa, respectively. Proteinase activities were begun to increase within 24 hrs after ampu? tation. All types of proteinase activities in? duced during tail regeneration were strongly inhibited by treatment of PMSF and aprotinin but not by pepstatin A, E-64, iodoacetamide and metal ion free-medium, indicating that they are serine proteinases. By fibrin autog- raphy, we have detected an elevation of plasminogen activator (PA) just prior to serine proteinase peaks, suggesting that these serine proteinases would be a member of plasmin.

Computational method for identification of functionally significant non-coding se? quences: studies of Hox cluster organiza? tion. A question of considerable interest to evolutionary developmental biologists is the linkage between Hox gene architec? ture and spatio-temporal expression pat? terns during embryogenesis. The prevail? ing hypothesis is that this linkage results from a network of interacting cis-regula? tory elements that compete for and share the transcriptional regulatory apparatus of clustered Hox genes. There are two im? portant corollaries of this hypothesis that we are addressing. 1) If the clustered ar? chitecture of the Hox complex is depen? dent on the sharing and competition be? tween cis-regulatory elements, then the elements should be functionally significant and undergoing purifying selection. 2) The network of regulatory elements within each cluster should be sufficiently extensive to account for the evolutionary maintenance of linkage between the clustered architec? ture and spatio-temporal expression pat? terns. We have developed a computational method to identify functionally significant non-coding seqeunces; i.e. sequences under purifying selection and used it to examine non-coding sequences both up? stream and downstream of the Hoxb7a pseudogene in teleosts. Our results dem? onstrate the occurrence of an extensive network of intergenic sequence domains undergoing purifying selection in the neigh- borhood of the Hoxb7a pseudogene. The significance of the sequence domains identified is underscored by the fact that one of the domains identified in our analy? sis has previously been shown to be present on all Hox clusters in the same relative position.

Study of the otoliths and otic area in carapidae fishes : eco-morphological impli? cations? Carapidae-family species are characterised by so-called oto-physical structures (sonic muscles, broad first apo- physes covering the anterior part of the swimbladder, etc.) The family includes pe? lagic (e.g. Pyramodon sp.) and benthic (e.g. Echiodon sp.) species and ones that are either commensal (e.g. Carapus sp.) or parasites of (e.g. Encheiiophis sp.) in? vertebrates (sea cucumbers, etc). The aim of the work is to seek possible relation? ships between the structures of the inner ear on the one hand and otophysical struc? tures and lifestyles within the Carapidae family. In the eight species studied, the otic cavity is wide, the saccular otosac and its sagitta are particularly developed. The sacculi touch each other on the median line. A comparison of the inner ear struc? tures reveals notably that the species with the most developed sagitta and sacculus are those with the largest parapophyses. These structures, both auditory and oto? physical, are most developed in species that are not completely free-swimming, i.e., with a commensal or especially a para? sitic lifestyle. 53.5 PARSONS, J.L*, HELLGREN, E.C., LOCHMILLER, R.L.

Protein nutrition of Southern plains small mammals: comparative nitro? gen requirements for reproduction. Nitrogen nutrition and dynamics in ani? mal communities are of increasing interest, given growing amounts of nitrogen in ter? restrial and aquatic systems and the role of nitrogen as an essential nutrient. We per? formed feeding trials on two small mammal species (the hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus, and the fulvous harvest mouse, Reithrodontomys fulvescens) to determine nitrogen requirements for reproduction. Be? cause of the relatively low-protein diet of wild cotton rats, we predicted that S. hispidus would have a lower nitrogen requirement than R. fulvescens. Females were fed one of seven experimental diets (1% to 3.5% ni? trogen) from the third trimester ofgestation through lactation. Offspring were weighed every other day from birth until weaning, and pup growth rate was regressed on maternal nitrogen intake. A break-point analysis was performed to determine each species' re? productive requirement. Our data indicate that S. hispidus required 2.47% dietary ni? trogen (2731.08 mg/kg?75) and R. fulvescens required 1.69% nitrogen (2258.48 mg/kg075) for maximal reproduction. Although our pre? diction was not upheld, the use of maximum reproductive output to define nitrogen re? quirements may not reflect the reality of free- ranging animals. Results will be discussed with regard to interspecies comparisons, di? etary niche and life-history strategies, and alternate analyses will be proposed to find a more ecologically relevant definition of re? productive requirements. 5.5 PASSAMANECK, YJ.*, HALANYCH, K.M., MITA/Voods Hole Oceanographic In? stitution Joint Prog, Woods Hole Oceano? graphic Institution.

In order to understand the magnitude of the osmoregulatory stress imposed upon juvenile blue crabs in low salinities, the wa? ter and sodium permeabilities of these crabs were measured after acclimation to either sea water (1000 mOsm) or dilute sea water (150 mOsm) and compared to adult and sub- adult specimens. Crabs were incubated in their acclimation medium to which either 3H20 or 22NaCI was added. After at least 24 h equilibration, washout of the isotope was monitored into non-radioactive media. The rate of passive efflux was used as an index of relative permeabilities. In all cases, there was an inverse logarithmic relationship be? tween size and permeability, typical of meta? bolic rate scaling functions. Acclimation to 150 mOsm induced a decrease in Na per? meability for crabs of all sizes, but the de? crease was greater for juvenile crabs than for adults. Water efflux was unchanged in both adult and juvenile crabs acclimated to150 mOsm relative to the rate in sea water. Because the osmotic gradient is much larger at low salinity, these data reflect a decrease in water permeability. While juvenile crabs are capable of marked reductions of Na and water permeability in low salinities, the data suggest that this is not sufficient to completely offset a higher metabolic cost associated with osmoregulation relative to adults.

Culex is a genus of mosquito that pos- sesses both freshwater restricted (e.g. C quinquefasciatus) and euryhaline larvae (e.g. C. tarsalis), the latter being able to tolerate up to 70% full strength seawater. While held in freshwater conditions, both the euryhaline and the freshwater-re- stricted species are hyperosmotic regula- tors and maintain similar hemolymph ion concentrations. However, when environ? mental osmolality is raised using salts, C quinquefasciatus cannot survive whereas C tarsalis employs the osmoconforming strategy, in which hemolymph osmolality conforms to the environment thereby elimi- nating the gradient for water loss. Follow? ing an acute increase in environmental sa? linity, the larva of C. tarsalis, regulate body volume by increasing their drinking rate of the external medium. Increases in hemolymph Na and CI concentrations are attenuated by the differential stimulation of Na efflux and reduction of CI influx. The rise in hemolymph osmolality during ac? climation to higher salinity is attributed to the accumulation of two organic osmolytes: the amino acid proline and the disaccharide trehalose. Hemolymph pro? line levels increase almost 50 fold and tre? halose accumulates two fold from fresh? water values. Additionally, proline is ac? cumulated intracellularly to levels equiva? lent to that found in the extracellular com? partment (hemolymph), the first such case reported in salt-tolerant animals. By ma- nipulating environmental osmolality using salts, compatible solutes (sorbitol), or a combination thereof, we determined that proline accumulation is cued by changes in hemolymph NaCl whereas trehalose follows environmental osmolality. The source for the proline accumulation dur? ing the osmoconforming response is not from hemolymph proteins but rather the stimulation of proline synthesis from glutamate.

McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="243">sapidus: cDNA sequencing and salinity- related expression of alpha subunit mRNA and protein. Many studies have shown that hyperosmoregulation in euryhaline crabs is accompanied by enhanced Na,K-AT? Pase activity in posterior gills, but it is not clear whether the response is due to acti? vation of pre-existing enzyme or to in? creased gene transcription and mRNA translation. To address this question, the complete open reading frame and 3' untranslated region of the mRNA coding for the ALPHA subunit of Na,K-ATPase were amplified and sequenced by RT-PCR. The resulting 3,433-nucleotide cDNA en? codes a putative 1,011-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 112.5 kDa. Hydrophobicity analysis of the amino acid sequence indicated eight membrane- spanning regions, in agreement with pre? viously suggested topologies. The ALPHA subunit amino acid sequence is highly con? served among species, with the blue crab sequence showing 81-83% identity to other arthropods and 74-77% identity to vertebrate and non-arthropod invertebrate species. Semi-quantitative PCR showed high levels of ALPHA subunit mRNA in posterior gills 6-8 compared with anterior gills 3-5. Western blots of gill plasma mem? branes revealed a single Na,K-ATPase ALPHA subunit protein band of the ex? pected size. Posterior gills contained a much greater level of ALPHA subunit pro? tein compared with anterior gills, in agree? ment with historical measurements of en? zyme activity. Transfer of blue crabs from 35 to 5 ppt salinity was accompanied by modest increases in ALPHA subunit mRNA and protein in posterior gills, pro? viding a molecular explanation for the en? hanced Na,K-ATPase enzyme activity that accompanies the hyperosmoregulatory response.

Morphological adap? tation of dorsal fin of harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) to swimming and thermal regulation function. Dorsal fin is an example of particular specialization of an organ having com? bined function of stabilization of motion and heat regulation. The shape of the fin was evaluated by the set of wing and foil pa? rameters: angle of leading edge sweep, leading edge radius, maximum thickness of the foil, position of maximum thickness from the leading edge. The distribution of thickness of epidermis, papillary and sub- papillary layers of dermis, ligamentous layer of fin as well as dermal ridges direc? tion, 3D structure of dermal-epidermal joint, central core structure and character? istic features of the blood system of dorsal fin had been studied. It was found that morphology parameters of dorsal fin de? pend on wing and foil parameters. Since the skin structure is the base of the skin mechanical properties, the founded regu- larity can be considered as an indirect evidence of correspondence of passive mechanical properties of the surface to the fin flow. The central core structure assigns smooth decrease of the rigidity of dorsal fin in chordwise and spanwise directions. Ligamentous layer being elastic and al? most not extensible braid of fin prevents from excessive bending in these directions. The characteristic feature of dorsal fin blood system consists in existence of com? bined vessels in the central core, where the braid of veins surrounds arteries as well as the system of big veins beneath the ligamentous layer. Such characteristic provides an effective heat exchange be? tween venous and artery blood as well as transfer of the heat redundancy into the environment. Dorsal fin design is the com- promise between wing performance and requirements of thermal regulation. 17.3 PEDERSEN, SP, South Dakota State University.

Volcanic activity has declined during the last two years. and fruitbat populations have re- bounded slightly as estimated by bat cap- tures per net-night. There was a focal in? crease in sub-lethal pathologies associated with ash-fall during peak volcanic activity (95-98). Before the onset of activity, 3/641 (&lt; 1%) fruit bat captures exhibited tooth wear. Since 1995, 35/190 (18%) fruit-bats exhib? ited abnormal wear and/or dental attrition. Occlusal surfaces of remaining teeth exhibit abnormal wear, advanced dramatically by the incidental ingestion of volcanic ash while feeding and grooming. Idiopathic hair-loss (alopecia) had only been observed once in 638 captures before e95. Alopecia was fre? quently (30-60%) recorded for all Brachyphylla, Artibeus, and Ardops in e97- i98. This alopecia is likely related to roost- parasitism, and possible mineral deficien? cies associated with ash ingestion. During 2000, alopecia was noted only in female Brachyphylla.

Seasonal gonadal recrudes? cence in song sparrows (Melospiza melodia): response to temperature cues. Reproduction is timed so the likelihood of offspring survival is optimal, and for sea? sonal breeders often coincides with peaks in food abundance. Changing of the sea? sons is predictable at mid-latitudes, and spring is forecasted by lengthening days in winter. However, additional environmental cues (e.g. temperature, rainfall) give more precise information about when subsequent food peaks will occur. We tested the effects of temperature on the seasonal reproduc? tive development of male song sparrows (Melospiza melodia morphna) from two populations: the coast of Western Washing? ton (3 m) and the Cascade Mountains (1600 m). In the field, the timing of gonadal recru- descence can differ between the two popu? lations by as much as two months, but in the lab under identical conditions, testes grow at the same rate. To investigate the role of temperature on the rate of gonadal growth, we captured birds from each population and assigned them to one of two treatment groups (2x2 design). We held birds in tem? perature controlled environmental cham? bers that either mimicked temperatures ex? perienced in the mountains or on the coast. We increased daylength on a natural sched? ule in all groups, and measured testis vol? ume, levels of circulating testosterone and prolactin, and song rates. Increasing daylength stimulated gonadal growth in all groups. Only in the mountain birds did colder, montane temperatures produce slowed rates of gonadal growth, delaying the onset of growth by one month when compared to all other groups. Since temperature changes more markedly during the early winter months in the mountains than on the coast, increas? ing temperature may be a more relevant cue in timing of reproduction in the mountain population.

Corticotropin releasing factor, CRF, plays a major role in homeostasis by mediating the endocrine, autonomic, immune and be? havioral responses to stress. The actions of CRF result from activation of its receptors, CRF-R1 and CRF-R2, which are encoded by distinct genes and belong to the family of 7-TMD receptors which includes those for GRF, secretin, calcitonin and PTH. The re? ceptors couple to GTP-binding proteins and activate adenylate cyclase. CRF-R1 is widely expressed in the central nervous system and also in the pituitary, gonads, thymus and adrenals. One splice variant of CRF-R2 is 1168 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="245">expressed mainly in the central nervous system while the other variant is appears in the heart, skeletal muscle, epididymis and Gl tract. The second mammalian CRF-re- lated peptide, urocortin, Ucn is found in many brain areas and also in the heart, Gl tract and immune system, regions of high expres? sion of CRF-R2. Pharmacology of the CRF ligand family, including (fish) urotensin, (frog) sauvagine and (insect) diuretic hormone show that all the CRF ligands bind with simi? lar high affinity to CRF-R1, but urocortin, urotensin and sauvagine are more potent than CRF for CRF-R2. Ucn is a potent anti- inflammatory agent, modulates vascular tone, displays cardiovascular effects, and acting centrally, reduces appetite and food intake. Transgenic mice lacking functional CRF-R1 display impaired stress responses, reduced anxiety and lack of acute anorectic effect of Ucn. In contrast, CRF-R2 knock-out mice show hypersensitivity to stress, anxi- ety-like behavior, reduced food intake fol? lowing food deprivation and lack of Ucn-in- duced hypotension. The future holds prom- ise for discovering new CRF ligands and receptors and further understanding of their manifold physiologic roles. 38.6 PERRY, G.*, GARLAND, T, JR, Uni? versity of Wisconsin, Madison. Lizard home ranges revisited: traditional and phylogenetic perspectives. Home range (HR) is the area traversed during food gathering, mating, and other rou? tine activities. Thus, it is an ecologically im? portant indicator of the behavioral and re? source requirements of an animal. We re- evaluated the factors affecting estimates of HR area in lizards. We compiled a database of over 470 published sex X population data sets. After removal of incomplete sets, we analyzed data representing 103 populations from 58 species. Conventional nested analy? sis of covariance, which treats each data point as statistically independent, showed highly significant effects of all factors and covariates tested, including both biological (diet, habitat type, body size, sex) and meth? odological (calculation method, number of sightings) ones. Addition of basic phyloge? netic information (major and minor clade) to the statistical model produced similar con- clusions. HR did not significantly differ be? tween members of Autarchoglossa and Iguania, but the differences among families, nested within these two major clades, were highly significant. To account for possible phylogenetic non-independence, we also analyzed the data with independent con? trasts (Felsenstein, 1985, Am. Nat. 125:1-15; Garland, Midford, and Ives, 1999, Am. Zool. 39:374-388), and a phylogeny assembled from published studies. This analysis pro? duced similar results: diet, habitat type, body size, and calculation method had significant effects for both sexes, but no differences were detected between Autarchoglossa and Iguania. The allometric slope for HR area was similar to that for the scaling of field meta? bolic rates of lizards (Nagy, Girard, and Brown, 1999, Annu. Rev. Nutr. 19:247-277). NSF IBN-9723758.

The phylogenentic investigations of the Perciformes (Actinopterygii) and the ori? gin of the Antarctic Notothenioidei: infer? ences for mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences. Comprising approximately 9,300 species, the Perciformes represents the largest order of vertebrates. Perciform fishes are the domi- nate component of vertebrate ocean life. The Antarctic fishes of the Notothenioidei are classified as sub-taxon of the Perciformes. Assessment of notothenioid monophyly is complicated by the lack of resolute phyloge? netic hypotheses for perciform fishes. Mor? phological characters have been unable to unambiguously discriminate among alterna? tive hypotheses due to the lack of informa? tive character states and a propensity of con? vergent evolutionary trends.

Sexual se? lection and dimorphism of morphology and locomotor performance in a polygynous, ter? ritorial lizard. Integrative, whole-animal traits such as locomotor performance could, in theory, evolve via sexual selection. Predictions of this hypothesis include: 1) such a second? ary sexual performance characteristic should be sexually dimorphic in adults, but not in juveniles, 2) proximate morphologi? cal correlates of performance should vary similarly, and 3) variation in performance among males should be correlated to mating success. We tested these predic? tions in a population of the polygynous, male-territorial lizard Crotaphytus collaris. Maximal sprint performance was mea? sured on a computer-timed racetrack in complete ontogenetic series of wild-caught male and female collared lizards. Individual variation in sprint speed was highly re- peatable. Sprint speed scaled to body size, but was not consistently correlated with any other morphological characteris? tics once body size was accounted for. Contrary to our prediction, size-relative sprint speed did not differ between sexes in any size class. In contrast, adult lizards (but not juveniles) were strongly sexually dimorphic for several morphological char? acteristics, including relative hindlimb length (a common intraspecific correlate of sprint speed in other lizards). We sug? gest that the longer legs of males may com- pensate for the slowing effect of their rela? tively much larger heads. In a subset of adult males for which both field and labo? ratory data were available, sprint speed was a better predictor of territory size and number of female home ranges over- lapped than was body size or any other morphological variable. These results are suggestive of sexual selection for whole- animal locomotor performance in male collared lizards, but do not reveal proxi? mate correlates of performance variation. 17.1 PFENNIG, D W *, HARCOMBE, W R., PFENNIG, K S., University of North Caro? lina, Chapel Hill, University of North Caro? lina, Chapel Hill, University of Texas, Austin. Coral snake mimics are protected only when they occur with their model. Many species avoid being eaten by mim- icking unpalatable species. A critical, but untested, prediction of mimicry theory is that protection from predators should break down in the absence of a dangerous model. We evaluated this prediction in two presumed coral snake mimicry complexes. We found that free-ranging predators avoided plasticine replicas of coral snake "mimics" in areas where highly venomous coral snakes occurred, but not in areas where coral snakes were absent. These data sup? port the central prediction of Batesian mim? icry and indicate that tricolor patterns in nonvenonmous snakes are maintained evolutionarily by the protection received from resembling coral snakes. 30.1 PFENNIG, KS. *, TINSLEY, R.C, Uni? versity of Texas, Austin, University of Bristol, UK. Parasites, female mating behavior and sexual selection on male traits. Female choice for parasite-free mates often may favor the evolution of elaborate male traits that indicate male health. Yet, parasite infection of females can alter their mate preferences, thereby mitigating selec? tion on male traits. Here, we show that fe? male spadefoot toads face a paradox. Whereas males that can provide females with enhanced fertilization success are more likely to harbor sexually-transmittable para? sites, unparasitized males may be less able to fertilize an entire femalefs clutch. We found that female mate preferences de? pended on the femalefs own infection sta? tus. In particular, unpara-sitized females pre? ferred mates that potentially provide greater fertilization success despite the risk that fe? males accrue of selecting parasitized mates. By contrast, parasitized females avoided parasitized mates, even though such males may provide enhanced fertilization success. Consequently, the different preferences be- 1170 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Actin-rich sen? sory receptors in Convoluta pulchra (Platyhelminthes, Acoelomorpha) identified by correlative electron and fluorescence mi? croscopy. Phalloidin-stained whole mounts of acoel turbellarians show brightly fluorescing club- shaped structures distributed over the epi? dermis and concentrated especially at the anterior and posterior tips of the body. By correlating electron micrographic images and fluorescence images of Convoluta pulchra, these structures can be seen to be sensory receptors with a central cilium sur- rounded by a collar of microvilli. Other can- didates for the fluorescence in the epider? mis, namely gland necks and a second type of sensory receptor lacking the collar of mi? crovilli, can be ruled out. The collared sen? sory receptors were inserted between epi? dermal cells, and each bore a central cilium surrounded by a collar of 6,18 microvilli and an additional centrally positioned 2,7 mi? crovilli of which 2 or 3 were associated with a modified rootlet called the swallow's nest. Confocal scanning laser microscopy re? solved the core of actin filaments within the microvilli of the collar and their rootlet-like connections to the base of the sensory cell. Such receptors could be identified by fluo? rescence microscopy in several other spe? cies of acoel turbellarians as well. 62.5 PHILLIPS, N.E., University of Califor? nia, Santa Barbara. The effects of larval nu? tritional history on larval condition and post- settlement juvenile growth of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. For organisms with planktonic feeding larvae, variation in food availability during the larval stage influences the condition of larvae as they develop, and may also have effects on the performance of juveniles after they settle. To investigate this issue for the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, full sibling larvae were raised in the laboratory in three different food treatments. Each treatment was composed of equal amounts of two species of cultured phytoplankton, and differed only in the total amount of food available. The food treatments were 20,000,2,000, and 500 cells/ml. Larval size, measured weekly, var? ied predictably with larval food treatment (i.e. larvae from the highest food level were al? ways largest). After 3-4 weeks, larvae were competent and settled onto introduced sub? strates. The mean size and lipid content of settlers was largest for larvae from the 20,000 cells/ml treatment. A subset of substrates from each larval food treatment were kept in the lab and half fed a high and half fed a low juvenile food ration for 10 and 20 days. The remaining substrates were moved to ropes hanging from a pier and left for two weeks. Juveniles were then recovered and mea? sured. In all cases, juveniles from the high? est larval food treatment were significantly larger than those from the lowest larval food treatment. From the pier, high larval food ju? veniles were 43% larger than low larval food juveniles even though they had been grow? ing in the same environment for two weeks post-settlement. Juvenile growth compared between laboratory and field settlers from each of the different larval food treatments had substantial interactions. This work dem- onstrates the important effects larval nutri? tional history may have on juvenile perfor? mance, and how those effects might vary with conditions at the site of settlement.

Morphological and immunochemi- cal properties of the urinary bladder in fe? male atlantic stingrays (Dasyatis sabina). In vertebrates, urinary bladders serve as temporary storage organs for urine produced by the kidneys. Additionally, bladders are able to attenuate the final pH and ionic con? centrations of urine before it is excreted. In elasmobranch fishes, the urinary bladder has been described in the little skate (Raja erinacea), where it is only found in females 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

The goal of this study was to de? scribe the urinary bladder of another elas- mobranch species, the Atlantic stingray (Dasyatis sabina), and determine if the blad? der demonstrates immunochemical evi? dence of enzymes known to be important for acid/base and ion regulation. We found that female Atlantic stingrays have two blad- ders (one for each kidney) that accumulate urine from several collecting ducts. Histo? logical observations revealed that the blad? der is composed of an outer connective tis- sue/muscular layer and an inner cuboidal epithelium (urothelium) that lines the blad? der lumen. The urothelium is immunoreac? tive for carbonic anhydrase, vacuolar-pro- ton-ATPase, and Na+,K+-ATPase, suggest? ing that it may have a role in acid/base and ion regulation of the Atlantic stingray.

The vacuolar proton-ATPase (V-H-AT- Pase) is an important ion transporter that is responsible for energizing a variety of ac? tive transport processes in animals. Recently, the V-H-ATPase has been considered alikely transporter for driving active sodium uptake by the gills of freshwater teleosts. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the activity and expression of V-H-ATPase in the gills decreased when freshwater rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), were accli? mated to seawater. To date, V-H-ATPase has been immunolocalized in the gills of a ma? rine elasmobranch (Squalus acanthias), but studies on its expression in response to changes in environmental salinity have yet to be conducted. In this study, we used im? munochemical techniques to examine the effect of environmental salinity on expres? sion of the V-H-ATPase B-subunit in a eury? haline elasmobranch, the Atlantic stingray (Dasyatis sabina). Western blots demon? strated that V-H-ATPase expression was negatively correlated with environmental sa? linity; gills from freshwater rays demonstrated the highest abundance of the transporter, while lowest abundance was associated with gills from seawater rays. Immunohis? tochemistry revealed that V-H-ATPase-rich cells were present on both the gill lamellae and interlamellar region of freshwater rays, while seawater rays only had V-H-ATPase- rich cells on the gill interlamellar region. Our results demonstrate that branchial V-H-AT- Pase expression in the Atlantic stingray fol? lows a similar trend as found in the rainbow trout, and we suggest that the V-H-ATPase in elasmobranch gills may be important for ion uptake from freshwater environments.

Physiology-based trade-offs in diet and habi? tat selection of a small shorebird. Red knots (Calidris canutus, Scolo- pacidae) are small, 120 g, shorebirds that breed on High Arctic tundra and spend the nonbreed-ing season in coastal intertidal areas, reaching much of the world's coast- lines in the course of their migrations. Red knots are sensory equipped to efficiently detect hard-shelled prey such as bivalves buried in soft sediments. They are also spe? cialized in processing these prey that con? sist largely of salt water and shell. We have studied their diet and habitat requirement in the field and in the laboratory using a large array of techniques, often focussing on what we consider key physiological pro? cesses. Using energy budgets as the ba? sis, we aim to contrast the great range of energy expenditure levels encountered by individual knots in the course of their an? nual cycle and by knots of different popu? lations spending the nonwintering season in very different climates. Shifting focus to the components of energy budgets, we examine the different cost factors and the 1172 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Underlying these considerations is the realization that the phenotypic flexibility of red knots and other shorebirds demands that external (envi? ronmental) and internal (physiological) factors always have to be studied in con- cert. P2A3PIRTLE, T.J.*, SATTERLIE, R.A., Ari? zona State University. Ionic currents under? lying the activity of swim interneurons of Clione limacina. The marine pteropod mollusk, Clione limacina is used as a model system to study the cellular basis of locomotor speed change. Clione swim by alternate dorsal and ventral flexion of wing-like parapodia.The swim cen? tral pattern generator is located in the pedal ganglia and consists of two groups of inter? neurons ? one group of interneuron (d-in- terneurons) controls the dorsal bend of the wing and another group (v-interneurons) controls the ventral bend of the wing. The two antagonistic groups of interneurons in? teract through reciprocal inhibitory synapses. Thus, when one group of interneuron is ac? tive it simultaneously inhibits activity in the other group. Additionally, both d-interneu- rons and v-interneurons exhibit postin? hibitory rebound (PIR). Jointly, the recipro? cal inhibitory synaptic connections between d-interneurons and v-interneurons and PIR generate the basic motor rhythm. Here we describe preliminary data that suggests that isolated Clione swim interneurons exhibit three inward currents that include an inward current that generates PIR (lPIR). In addition, Clione swim interneurons exhibit at least two outward currents ? one that closely re? sembles a delayed rectifier type K+-current (lK) and one that closely resembles the fast transitory K+-current (lA). Changes in swim? ming speed are produced in part by serotonin's modulation of the intrinsic prop? erties of swim interneurons. We are currently investigating serotonin's modulation of iden? tified currents in Clione swim interneurons. 46.5 PIZER, M. *, WRAY, G.A., Duke Univer? sity. The evolution and development of left- right asymmetry in echinoderms. Echinoderms have a bilaterally symmetri? cal larva that becomes left-right asymmetric when adult structures begin to develop. These structures form primarily on the left side of the larva, eventually producing a pentaradially symmetrical adult. This un? usual symmetry transition is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the phylum and plays a central role in many theories of echi? noderm origins. We are using a variety of approaches to investigate the evolution and development of left-right asymmetry and metamorphosis in echinoderms. The first of these approaches involves determining the fates of cells in the left and right larval coelo? mic sacs in a variety of echinoderm groups. Comparison of the degree of left-right asym? metry between different classes of echino? derms suggests how this feature has evolved within the phylum. The second ap? proach uses molecular developmental tech? niques to investigate the mechanistic basis of left-right asymmetry in echinoids. The study of the developmental mechanisms of the unique symmetry characteristics of echinoderms has important implications for the evolution of these features in echino? derms and in deuterostomes.

Many heat shock proteins (Hsps) are known molecular chaperones that are fun? damental to protein folding. Although a great deal is known about Hsps as molecular chap? erones in model systems (e.g., E coli and cultured mammalian cells), very little is known about their function in organisms from natural populations. Consequently, we have little insight into the temperature interactions of Hsps under ecologically relevant condi? tions. In this study we examined the tem? perature-protein interactions of a molecular chaperone, Hsc70, from Gillichthys mirabilis, a goby that encounters a broad range of tem? peratures in its estuarine habitat.

Our goal was to address the question of how the biochemi? cal function of Hsc70 mapped onto the range of temperatures encountered by G. mirabilis in its natural environment. For these stud? ies, we examined the activity and biochemi? cal properties of Hsc70 purified from white muscle of G. mirabilis. Since Hsc70 binds and hydrolyzes ATP during a chaperoning cycle, ATPase activity was used as an indi? cator of chaperone function. Using an in vitro 32P-based ATPase assay, the results showed that (1) Hsc70 has a generally low intrinsic ATPase activity that can be stimu? lated by the addition of an unfolded protein, (2) Q10 calculations for the chaperone range from 1.2 -2.2 over the environmental tem? perature range for G. mirabilis, and (3) the thermal stability of Hsc70 greatly exceeds environmental temperatures for this species. The results indicate that Hsc70 from G. mirabilis is a thermally stable protein with an ATPase activity that is functional over a broad range of environmentally relevant temperatures.

The process of development requires complex interactions of mesenchyme and epithelium to specify tissue identity and unique organ specific morphology. The Hox family of homeobox genes encode transcrip? tional regulators that are crucial for specifi? cation of positional identity during embryo? genesis and which are expressed in a colin- ear manner in regionalized domains along the main body axis, limb, lung, and gut. Con? served mechanisms of gene expression and regulation are apparent during embryogen? esis and postnatal morphogenesis of these organ systems, with minimal variation evi? dent across species. A rudimentary path? way of essential developmental genes has been defined in the limb, which includes both positive and negative growth regulators such as Hox genes, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), and Bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 4. These same genes are abundantly ex? pressed in the primary and accessory sex organs during development and targeted loss of a specific member of the pathway results in genital abnormalities. It is proposed that vertebrate genitalia represent another developmental axis, similar to the limb, and that mechanisms that define positional iden? tity and control proliferation in the limb, lung and gut are also crucial for normal specifi? cation and morphogenesis of the primary and accessory sex organs. 62.6 PODOLSKY, R.D., University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Intertidal embryos: temperature tradeoffs during early develop? ment. Species from several phyla brood or de? posit benthic embryo masses in intertidal habitats. These habitats can expose embryos to extreme environmental change on short time-scales, which can have diverse effects on development. In the mollusc Melanochlamys diomedia environmental (= developmental) temperature can change from 11 to 34-degrees C and back over a tidal exchange. In the laboratory, time to hatching was influenced by temperature re? gimes associated with large vs. small ex? changes, and with variable vs. constant tem? peratures. Although embryos developed fastest under a regime characteristic of a large exchange, they are also the most vul? nerable to heat stress during such periods in the field. Embryos are especially vulner? able during their first one or two low tides when the induction of heat shock protein ex? pression is minimal or absent. In addition, embryo masses face a threat of premature dislodgment from the substrate, which may be greater during periods of greater ex? change, or may be reduced overall by more rapid development. These results indicate a complex set of tradeoffs that influence the success of development under variable tidal conditions. S8.2 POLCYN, DM, California State Uni? versity, San Bernardino.

Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="251">how film studios could create a east of insect characters realistic enough to retain their bio? logical characteristics yet "cuddly" enough to garner the affection of a mammal-oriented public. The solution, evidenced in several recent arthropod-based family films, has been an interesting blending of the oddities of arthropod natural history and anatomy with familiar, and often comforting, mammalian (usually human) characteristics. Although the resulting characters and story lines are not completely biologically realistic, they serve to introduce and educate the public to the largest group of organisms on earth -the Arthropods. Story lines revolve around the dynamics of social insect societies, interspe? cific and intraspecific competitive interac? tions, predator-prey relations, and the vari? ous ecological roles played by different spe? cies. The tremendous variety of anatomical modifications seen in the arthropods facili- tates the development of both "good" and "evil" characters, and the presence of char? acteristics such as the exoskeleton and hinged joints has been exploited in the de? velopment of animated characters as well as action figures and other toys. Appropri? ate terminology, although kept to a minimum, is used throughout the films to a surprisingly successful degree. Viewed as a whole, the recent releases of arthropod-based anima- tions have been far more realistic in portray- ing the structure, function and dynamics of arthropods than had previous attempts, and as such serve to simultaneously entertain and educate a national audience possess? ing an abysmally low level of scientific lit- eracy. 41.4 PORTER, H.T*, MOTTA, P.J, Univer? sity of South Florida. A comparison of prey capture behavior and kinematics in three ram feeding fishes. Ram feeding is the process by which a predatory fish uses a high-velocity lunge or chase to overtake its prey. This study com- pares the strike and prey capture behaviors and kinematics of three species of ram-feed- ing fishes: Florida gar Lepisosteus platyrhincus, redfin needlefish Strongylura notata, and great barracuda Sphyraena bar? racuda. These ram-feeding piscivores are morphologically similar with fusiform bod? ies, posteriorly-placed dorsal and anal fins, and large, conical teeth. Strike and prey cap? ture behaviors and kinematics for five indi? viduals of each species were recorded with high-speed video. Pre-strike behavior in gar consists of a slow stalk, resulting in the close, lateral positioning ofthe predator's head rela? tive to the prey. Gar employ a sideways lunge of the head during the strike, which lasts only 25 to 40 milliseconds. Needlefish and bar- racuda exhibit longitudinal orientation to the prey before the strike, followed by a high velocity, head-on lunge initiated by an s-start. Needlefish and barracuda achieve average strike velocities of 64 cm/s and 144 cm/s re? spectively. Prey capture in gar and needle? fish is characterized by the jaws closing on the prey, which is generally positioned or? thogonal to the jaws. This is followed by manipulation to reposition the prey head first, and suction transport into the buccal cavity. Manipulation can last up to 7000 millisec? onds. Prey capture in barracuda is accom- plished by closing the jaws after the prey has entered the buccal cavity, resulting in ram transport of the prey with no oral ma? nipulation. The differences among these species in kinematics may be related to dif? ferences in cranial morphology, size, and habitat-specific behaviors.

For mammals ranging in size from mice to elephants we show that calculated metabolic costs are in agreement with experimental data. We also demonstrate how we can do the same for birds ranging in size from hummingbirds to ostriches. We show the impact of changing posture and changing air temperatures on energetic costs for birds and mammals. We demon? strate how optimalbody size that maximizes the potential for growth and reproduction changes with changing climatic conditions and with diet quality. Climate and diet may play important roles in constraining commu? nity structure (collection of functional types of different body sizes) at local and global scales. Thus, multiple functional types may coexist in a locality in part because of the temporal and spatial variation in climate and seasonal food variation. We illustrate how the models can be applied in a conserva? tion and biodiversity context to a rare and endangered species of parrot, the Orange- bellied Parrot of Australia and Tasmania. 19.1 POWELL, J.S.*, RAFFA, K.F., Univer? sity of Wisconsin, Madison. The effect of feed- ing specificity on the fate of terpenoids in Lymantriidae (Lepidoptera). Insect herbivores possess a wide array of mechanisms for processing ingested phytochemicals. However, it is difficult to predict the fate of phytochemicals since it is influenced by many factors. We are testing whether feeding specificity influences the relative extent to which an herbivore relies on excretion, sequestration, and metabolism. Our model consists of 5 generalist and spe? cialist Lymantriids, each of which include conifer terpenes within its diet. The monoter- penes bornyl acetate, limonene, and myrcene, and the diterpenes isopimaric acid and neoabietic acid all occur in tamarack, a common coniferous host of the 5 Lymantriid species. Each species is fed known amounts of these compounds in amended diet. Frass, larvae and exuviae are analyzed to quantify excretion and sequestration. En? zyme inhibitors are used to determine whether specific enzymes are responsible for metabolism. The fate of monoterpenes has been examined in 4 species. Prelimi- nary results suggest metabolism is the most important mechanism for processing monot- erpenes. Limonene and myrcene appear to be completely metabolized. Borneol, a me? tabolite of bornyl acetate is recovered in frass, larvae, and exuviae. Piperonyl butox- ide does not affect recovery of any monoter- pene or performance of larvae, indicating P450 enzymes are not responsible for me? tabolizing these monoterpenes. Excretion appears to be partially involved in process? ing bornyl acetate, but not limonene or myrcene. Both bornyl acetate and borneol are recovered from frass. The extent of each mechanism in processing monoterpenes depends on both the larval stadium and ter? pene concentration. 59.5 POWELL, KP*, ROMMEL, S.A., FL Mar. Res. Inst, St. Petersburg, FL Reproduc? tive anatomy of the female Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris). The Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris), an endangered marine mammal, inhabits coastal waters of the Southeastern United States. Relative to many other mammals, descriptions of the female reproductive tract of the Florida mana? tee are limited. It is essential to understand the reproductive capabilities and limitations of this species in order to better assess its reproductive potential. In this study, repro? ductive tracts from over 100 female Florida manatee carcasses, from calf to adult, were examined. Gross anatomical descriptions were made, refining previous descriptions of the reproductive tract; we compare the manatee with dogs, elephants and dugongs. The manatee tract resembles that of the closely related dugong. The perianal posi? tion of the urogenital opening (on the ven? tral abdomen) is the only reliable sexually dimorphic external feature. The urogenital sinus is moderate in size, in contrast to dogs and elephants. A distinct hymen is present in very young manatees. The cervical canal in manatees is directed cranioventral vs craniodorsal in dogs. Cervical position im? plies sperm deposition is vaginal. The uterus is bicornuate.

Survivor: the energetics of crayfish in burrows. Procambarus clarkii (PC) and P. zonangulus (PZ) share overlapping ranges in the southeastern United States. Within this shared range the success of each species varies, possibly related to the ability to sur? vive environmental challenges and ex? tended periods of nutrient deprivation dur? ing the summer when both species retreat to burrows. Metabolic rate, proximate com? position and energy content were deter? mined for adult male crayfish during a five- month starvation period. The pattern and source of nutrients utilized during starvation varied between species. In PZ 75 % of the tail muscle and 30 % of the hepatopancreas was mobilized during the starvation period, compared to 60 % of both the tail muscle and hepatopancreas in PC. Although a greater percentage of the dry tissue was mo? bilized from the tail and hepatopancreas of both species, over 50 % of the total dry ma? terial was mobilized from the remaining car? cass. Nutrient utilization in both species was tissue-specific; the hepatopancreas mobi? lized a greater percentage of lipid, and tail muscle a greater percentage of protein. PC mobilized almost twice as much energy as PZ, but from different tissues. PC mobilized 8 % of the energy from the hepatopancreas, 14 % from the tail and 78 % from the car? cass. PZ mobilized 14 % of the energy from the hepatopancreas, 59 % from the tail and only 27 % from the carcass. Survivorship was 45 % for PC and 71 % of PZ. These different responses to nutrient deprivation may par? tially explain the observed changes in spe? cies composition in ponds.

Cutaneous water abosorption by Rough- skinned newts (Taricha granulosa) in open terrain vs. water-soaked environments. We measured cutaneous water uptake rate in Rough-skinned Newts (Tarichagranu? losa) using an open terrestrial (ventral sur? face only) and submergence (whole body) model to evaluate their ability to regulate wa? ter balance in open terrain vs. water-soaked environments. These are meaningful mea? surements for this species because they have both an aquatic and terrestrial phase during their annual cycle, and the osmoregu? latory challenges of these two periods are dramatically different. We hypothesized that net water flux rate (absorption rate - evapo- ration) would be higher in the submergence model based on two factors. First, this spe? cies is aquatic for much of the year and is likely adapted primarily to this environment. Second, using immunohistochemistry we have shown that the outer skin cells of both the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the newt contain high densities of aquaporin (AQP) water channels. This indicates that these surfaces are probably actively involved in water absorption. Surprisingly, our measure? ments show that net water flux rate in the open terrestrial model is slightly higher than in the submergence model. While the rea? sons for this result have yet to be determined, it is possible that ventral skin permeability is increased at appropriate times to maximize absorption rate. One way to control skin per? meability to water is to regulate the number of active AQP water channels. Hormones such as ADH, AVT, and All will likely be ma? jor players in the regulation of skin perme? ability regardless of the role of AQP. Previ? ous studies have shown that some AQP wa? ter channels are responsive ADH. We are currently working to sequence the AQP in newt skin so it can be compared to those that have shown ADH sensitivity. S11.14 PRATT, G., MIT, Cambridge. Low impedance robotics.

This philoso? phy is so pervasive that is has become part of the cultural definition of a robot. By con? trast, the impedance of animals is low. We cannot hold positions accurately in the face of unexpected force disturbances. What we can do is execute natural tasks, like locomo? tion, manipulation and prey catching, with breathtaking agility and grace. Previous work has shown that the passive dynamics of an animal's body acts to self-stabilize and au- tomatically sequence some movements. Un- fortunately, in today's stiff, trajectory con? trolled robots, such natural dynamics are over-ridden. We have developed a family of low-impedance actuators, mechanisms, and control philosophies that allow our robots to interact with the world more softly - more like animals. In the actuator arena, we have de? veloped a succession of series elastic ac? tuators that incorporate elasticity between the motor/transmission and the load. Used in a feedback configuration, this elasticity gives our actuators low minimum imped? ance, high force fidelity, high dynamic range, high shock tolerance, and the capacity for energy storage. In the control arena, we have developed physics-based low-impedance techniques and a general programming tool called virtual model control that extends the impedance control paradigm of robot con? trol. Using these control methods on both simulated and real low-impedance walking robots, we have demonstrated that soft, model free control can be effected in paral? lel with the natural dynamics of the robot. Experiments have shown that these tech? niques are capable of achieving both stabil? ity, performance, and, to the human eye, grace. 25.4 PRATT, M.C., Duke University Durham NC. Growth and survival of an erect and encrusting bryozoan in different flow habitats. Bryozoans are active filter feeding inver? tebrates that can exhibit a wide variety of different colonial growth forms. These growth forms can roughly be divided into species that are erect or encrusting. I compared the effects of hydrodynamics on the growth and survival of an encrusting and an erect bryo? zoan. Membranipora membranacea has an encrusting growth form and is found almost exclusively on large flat macroalgae (such as kelps) in relatively high and low flow habi? tats. Bugula pacifica has an erect growth form and is generally found on hard substrata (such as docks or rocks) in relatively low flow habitats. These two species do occa- sionally overlap in habitat: both can be found on large macroalgae in low flow environ? ments. Previous data suggest that Membranipora can capture more particles than Bugula at both slow (2.5cm/s) and fast (10cm/s) flow velocities. However, it remains to be seen whether a higher particle capture success translates into faster growth and/or higher survival rates. I measured the growth (change in area) and survival rate of Membranipora and Bugula colonies in the field in a high and low flow habitat over a month and a half time period. Growth rate did not vary greatly between high and low flow habitats for either species, but survival rate did vary between species and between habitats. Membranipora had a higher sur? vival rate than Bugula in both flow habitats, and both species had a higher survival rate in the slower flow habitat than in the higher flow habitat. These results suggest that hy? drodynamics can have a large effect on sur? vival of bryozoans based on their growth form. P1.53PREEST, M.*, GONZALEZ, R., The Claremont Colleges, University of San Di? ego. Ion balance in the extremely acid-toler- ant neon tetra. Neon tetras (Paracheirodon innesi) are native to acidic waters of the Amazon. They are highly acid-tolerant and survive expo? sure to acidity levels that are lethal to many species due to a disruption of ion fluxes, particularly Na+. Uptake of Na+ in neon tet? ras is insensitive to pH (down to 3.25), and influx is only mildly sensitive to amiloride, a Na+ channel blocker. This suggests Na+ up? take might occur as the result of a novel mechanism. We investigated ion balance in neon tetras by measuring ion fluxes during exposure to a variety of blockers of trans? porters proposed to exist in gill epithelia.

Na+/ H+ exchange blockers (DMA, MIA, EIPA, HMA) and Na+ channel blockers (benzamil, phenamil) failed to inhibit Na+ uptake in neon tetras, but all, except benzamil, reduced up? take in goldfish. The H+ blocker vanadate had no effect on either species. A Na+/CI co- transport blocker, furosemide, inhibited Na+ and Cl uptake in goldfish, but not neon tet? ras. Exposure to AgCI2, a potent Na+/K+ AT? Pase blocker, reduced uptake in both spe? cies. Finally, acetazolamide, an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase did not inhibit Na+ up? take in either species, but reduced Cl up? take in neon tetras. The relative insensitivity of neon tetras to this array of agents may be due to a novel mechanism for branchial Na+ uptake. Alternatively, if they possess the same mechanisms, the transporters are suf- ficiently distinct so that inhibitors effective against other fish have no effect on neon tetras. These differences may be responsible for continued function at extremely low pH. P1.78 PRESSMAN, E. *, TEMPLE, J. G., Mary Washington College, Fredericksburg, VA. An examination of the thermoregulatory re? sponse of the garter snake Thamnophis ra- dix radix to the baeterium Aeromonas hydrophila. Research has shown that certain spe? cies of ectotherms behaviorally induce a fe- ver in response to an infection. Research has also shown that the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis shows a hypothermic response to bacterial infection. This prelimi? nary experiment addresses the thermoregu? latory behavior of Thamnophis radix radix in response to a bacterial (Aeromonas hydrophila) infection. It also addresses whether, if given a localized infection, Thamnophis radix radix will induce a fever only in the infected part of its body by com? paring the thermoregulatory responses of snakes given localized infections to those given a general infection. Snakes were al? lowed to thermoregulate in an aquarium with a thermal gradient. For the general infection procedure, saline was injected intraperito- neally and 48 hours later, alcohol-killed Aeromonas hydrophila were injected intra- peritoneally. For the localized infection, the same injection schedule was followed, only injections were subcutaneous. Following all injections, cloacal temperatures were mea? sured continuously. The position of each snake on the gradient was recorded to de? termine patterns of thermoregulation. No temperature change was significant, thus showing neither a hypothermic nor a hyper- thermic response to infection. Thermoregu? latory patterns did not vary between the re? sponses to saline and bacteria injections or between responses to subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injections. P1.15PRESTON, R.L*, PRES-TON, E.J.D, MIDDAUGH, DR., Illinois State University Enzymatic racemization of amino acids in marine invertebrate tissues. Previously we showed that D-amino ac? ids are present in the cellular free amino acid pools of diverse groups of marine in? vertebrates. Using a coupled enzyme assay employing D-amino acid oxidase or chiral HPLC, we surveyed over 130 species of marine invertebrates in 12 phyla. About 40% of these species in 10 phyla showed detect? able levels of D-amino acids. In some cases, very high concentrations were observed, e.g. gill tissue of the soft-shelled clam, Mya arenaria, contained 63 mM D-alanine. D- Aspartate, D-glutamate, D-serine and D-ala? nine were detected in other species. We also showed that 14C-D-alanine was absorbed via membrane transport processes and me- tabolized. Transport occurred via low affinity L-amino acid preferring pathways or by D- stereoselective transport systems. The ma? jor pathway for D-alanine metabolism in? volved racemization. Using a modification of the coupled enzyme assay and chiral HPLC, we detected alanine racemase ac? tivity in 15 species of marine invertebrate (5 phyla). Analysis of partially purified race? mase from Mya gill revealed this enzyme was relatively specific for alanine (Km 9 mM). We screened other species for alanine and serine racemase activity. Some species ex? pressed only serine racemase activity (e.g. Limulus polyphemus) or only alanine race? mase activity (e.g. Lunatia heros). Other spe? cies expressed both serine and alanine race? mase activity (e.g. Asterias forbesi). We eur- 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

These data support the hypothesis that D-amino acids have signifi? cant biological roles in marine invertebrate tissues. Accumulating evidence suggests that D-amino acids may function as neuromodu-lators, as precursors for endog? enous antibiotics, may have a role in osmo? regulation and provide a contribution to the nutrition of marine invertebrates. 36.4 PRETE, FR. *, HURD, LE, JONES, T, PORTMAN, R., SINGH, T.B., CO, J.E., Vision Tech, inc, Morton Grove II, Washington &amp; Lee University, Lexington, VA, Virginia Mili- tary Institute, Lexington, VA, University of Tulsa, OK, Washington &amp; Lee University, Lexington, VA, Virginia Military Institute, Lex? ington, VA. Scent of a woman: the first identi? fication and assay of a mantid pheromone. Although insect pheromones are well studied, little is known about their roles in the life of predators such as praying man? tids. We examined the mantis Sphodromantis lineola, to determine (1) if females produce a pheromone-like chemical, (2) if the chemi? cal has an effect on male behavior, and (3) if males possess antenna sensilla capable of sensing a pheromone. Female headspace samples collected via solid phase microextrac-tion and analyzed with gas chro- matography revealed a 1:3 ratio of tetradecanal to pentadecanal (the putative pheromone). In Y-maze tests, males always chose the maze arm with the synthesized pheromone, spending an average of 99% their time there. In an open-field test, the syn? thesized pheromone elicited vigorous mat- ing-related behaviors directed toward other males and dummies. These behaviors in? cluded flying leaps onto males, abdominal twisting and lateral flexion (indicative of at? tempts to intromit), and phallomere spread? ing. SEM photos of male antennae revealed that among the estimated 30,000 hair- and peg-like sensilla were several well-recog- nized classes of chemoreceptors: large (100- 130 um long) uniporous trichoid sensilla with unelaborated apical pores; small (&lt;100 um long) multiporous trichoid sensilla; grooved, multiporous basiconic sensilla; and grooved, basiconic sensilla with apical pores. Of these, the multiporous trichoid and basiconic sen? silla are the most likely to be olfactory recep? tors responsive to airborne female produced pheromones. 42.6 PRICE, CL*, MEYERS, J.J., HERREL, A, NISHIKAWA, K.C., Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Northern Ari? zona University Flagstaff, University of Antwerp, Belgium, Northern Arizona Univer? sity, Flagstaff. Scaling and kinematics of tongue projection in chameleons. Within a year from hatching, chameleons ean grow up to two orders of magnitude. This rapid increase in body size likely imposes constraints on the function of chameleon muscles used for prey capture. In this study, we looked at the possible structural and functional constraints of prey capture kine? matics associated with body size. Constraints on the feeding system are likely high, as unique, ballistic tongue projection requires accurate control of the jaw and hyolingual apparatus. Mass, SVL, jaw length and head width, were measured in order to identify patterns of growth. Feeding sequences of each chameleon were filmed at 250 frames per second with a high-speed digital video camera. Movement, velocity and accelera? tion of the jaw and the hyolingual apparatus were quantified. Several species of chame? leons were studied, including C jacksonii, C melleri, C oustaleti, C fischeri and C calyptratus, which varied in size from ap? proximately one gram to 200 grams. Our analysis showed that the kinematics of prey capture in chameleons scale allometrically with body size. The data were graphed against mass, which yielded a linear regres? sion. The slope values were equivalent to slopes predicted by elastic similarity for al? lometric growth. Change in maximum tongue projection and maximum hyoid pro? trusion can be explained by allometric growth. The scaling of maximum gape dis? tance showed slight negative allometry. Analyses of EMG and muscle force mea? surements will be used to test these predic? tions further. 1180 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

We present the first explicit theories of the growth of feather shape (the outline of a pennaceous vane) and the determination of within feather pigmentation pattern. The growth of feathers is simulated with a math? ematical model based on six growth param? eters: (1) absolute barb and rachis ridge growth rate, (2) angle of helical growth of barb ridges, (3) initial barb ridge number, (4) new barb ridge addition rate, (5) barb ridge diameter, and (6) the angle of barb spread following emergence from the sheath. The growth model simulates a diversity of shapes that correspond closely to real feathers, in? cluding various contour feather shapes, asymmetrical feathers, and even emargin- ate primaries. Each parameter can have substantial independent effects on feather shape. The parameters also have complex and redundant effects on feather shape through their influence on the diameter of the follicle, the barb ridge fusion rate, and the intemodal distance. Accurate simulation of the shape and position of feather fault bars strongly confirms the uniform absolute growth rate hypothesis and the realism of the model. Within feather pigmentation pat? terning is simulated by activator-inhibitor models during feather growth. Simple acti- vator inhibitor models successfully simulate most common feather pigmentation patterns, including horizontal bars, stripes, and chev? rons. More complex patterns, such as alter? nating rows of spots, can be simulated by including additional parameters. The pig? mentation pattern models can simulate many of the complex transitions in feather pattern? ing observed in complex avian plumages. Together, the two models provide numerous testable predictions about the developmen? tal determination and evolution of feather shape and pigmentation patterning. 66.2 QUINN, N.J., University of Papua New Guinea. Reef check - Papua New Guinea's participation in a global assessment of hu? man effects on coral reefs. Villagers in Papua New Guinea (PNG) have used coral reefs for thousands of years. Recent human development in PNG has altered the use of coral reefs. Today more reefs are fished commercially, used by tour- ist divers, and impacted by coastal logging and mining companies. While the state of the reefs may be known locally, there has been no general assessment of the human effects on the coral reefs. Using Reef Check protocol developed by Dr. G. Hodson, stu? dents at the University of Papua New Guinea have been conducting surveys on coral reefs. To do this the students needed to be taught: 1) the use of a mask and snorket, 2) scuba diving skills, and 3) marine survey skills. Twenty-five students have received PADI open water certification. Advanced student divers conducted surveys of over 20 reefs. The results indicate that while human im? pact is obvious on some reefs, most of the reefs surveyed are in excellent shape with a high percentange live coral cover. PNG reefs are among the least disturbed reefs in the global Reef Check survey. Few crown of thorns starfish were observed. There is need to develop a well-funded coral reef monitor? ing program using national biologists in as? sociation with a community based marine awareness effort. Presently, many non gov- ernment conservation organizations (NGOs) are engaged in colonial conservation activi? ties. Their adgenda is directed by a foreign membership that fund marine biodiversity surveys using foreign experts. These activi? ties contribute little to the development of local skills and technology transfer. The dis? covery of new animals by foreign scientists effectively removes the possibility of future discovery by national scientists. Relation? ships between colonial NGOs and national tertiary education institutions need to be im? proved. P1.7 QUINN, NJ. *, NEWELL, P, University of West Indies, University of South Pacific.

Dermal melanin density explains variation in a phylogenetically la? bile color signal in Sceloporus lizards: cor- relational and experimental evidence. We examined the production of a signal? ing trait, blue abdominal patches, in three Sceloporus lizard species. Sexes and spe? cies can differ in the occurrence of the patches. We tested the hypothesis that blue patches require a high density of melanin in the dermis underlying the iridophore layer, and that the mechanism is conserved among Sceloporus expressing the patches. Measurements of relative melanin density using light microscopy images of abdomi? nal skin from Sceloporus undulatus consobrinus, S. virgatus, and S. jarrovii sup? port this hypothesis. Lizards with blue patches (male undulatus, and male and fe? male jarrovii) have more melanin than white abdominal skin from lizards lacking patches (female undulatus, and male and female virgatus). Within the sexually dimorphic undulatus (males blue females white), mela? nin abundance in blue abdominal skin was higher than melanin in white skin of females removed from the male patch location. In jarrovii (both sexes have blue abdominal patches) and virgatus (neither sex has blue abdominal patches), the pattern of higher melanin density in blue skin was consistent regardless of species or sex. We are quanti? fying melanin density of blue skin from undulatus females (normally white) that were androgen-manipulated as hatchlings for an experimental test of the melanin hypothesis. 30.3 QUINN, VS.*, HEWS, D.K, Indiana State University. Species variation in female preference for male behavioral and morpho? logical signaling traits. Handicap and Fisherian run-away theo? ries of sexual selection predict that male traits and female preferences for those traits have coevolved. Thus, gains or losses of male traits are coincident with female preferences for those male traits. However, sensory bias does not predict this coevolutionary pattern. We examined the coevolution of males and females in a phylogenetic context by com? paring the responses of females to male traits in sister species of Sceloporus lizards by manipulating a pair of blue abdominal patches of skin. We measured female re? sponse in S. u. consobrinus, a lizard repre? senting the ancestral and typical character state of sexual dimorphism. We also exam? ined S. virgatus a species representing a derived character state, male loss of abdomi? nal coloration. We presented females with pairs of male conspecifics, one with blue- painted patches and the other with white- painted patches. Female S. u. consobrinus, did not preferentially associate or copulate with males based on abdominal coloration, but did preferentially associate with the first male to display. Female S. virgatus associ? ated with and were mounted by white- painted more than blue-painted males.These data suggest that female responses to ab? dominal coloration have not coevolved with losses of this male signal in these species.

Striking the feet on the ground to cre? ate mechanical vibrations seems to have evolved independently in several lineages of fossorial and semi-fossorial desert rodents 1182 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

In the social context, rodents footdrum to communicate territorial ownership, competi? tive superiority, familiarity, submission and predation risk to conspecifics. Footdrumming is species specific and ranges from single thumps to individually distinct footdrumming signatures that the banner-tailed kangaroo rat, Dipodomys spectabilis, uses to adver- tise its territorial ownership to neighbors. Footdrumming signatures are flexible and can be adjusted to changes in the social environment. Many desert rodents also footdrum in the presence of predators. Soli? tary kangaroo rats footdrum at snakes and kit foxes in individual defense to inform the predator that the rat is alert, not easy prey and to go away. In contrast to solitary ro? dents, the great gerbil, Rhombomys opimus, from Central Asia is highly social and uses a combination of footdrum-ming and vocaliza? tions to communicate predation risk to off? spring, relatives and mates. Great gerbils may footdrum in the presence of snakes and polecats that hunt in burrows to communi? cate predation risk to family members inside the burrow. There is much more to be learned about vibrational communication in rodents. Research on more species from different habitats and lineages should reveal the di? versity and importance of this mode of com? munication in mammals. SU.9RAYNER, J. M.

The bird tail has been credited as a means of controlling stability and manoeuvrability in flight and as a supple? mentary lifting organ, but others have em? phasized its role in sexual selection and dis? play. Theoretical models of tail aerodynam- ics based on slender wing theory have not hitherto been tested. Flow visualization and force measurements with mounted Euro? pean starling Sturnus vulgaris reveal the ge? ometry of vortices around the tail, and the effect of the tail on airflow around the body. Lift from the spread starling tail at low speeds is strongly influenced by the presence of the body and does not correspond to predic? tions of slender wing theory. A furled tail has an important effect on body aerodynamics; it acts as a splitter plate, controlling the onset of separation on the anterior part of the body, and reducing parasite drag significantly. Flow control and body drag reduction is hy? pothesized to be the major role of the tail in normal forward flight, although the tail plays varied roles in different species. It probably evolved from a balancing, and heavy, bony tail in bipedal theropods. S8.4 REDD, J., SONY Pictures Image- works. Modeling fur and feathers and the need to balance perception, science, and entertainment. Artistic decisions are constantly made regarding the presentation of characters in films, especially when fanciful characters are placed into realistic or photorealistic envi? ronments. When animating or digitally pro? ducing a clearly fanciful character, care must be taken to adopt certain elements that will persuade the viewing audience that the "or? ganism" is interacting with that environment in a convincing manner. One of the most ef? fective component elements that allows per- suasive integration of such characters with a realistic environment are fur, feathers, and textured clothing. Modeling surfaces as com? plex as animal skins with fur or feathers re? quires that computer programmers and ani? mators deal with an enormous amount of data. Not only must every individual hair or feather be modeled and rendered, but the surface structure and texture of each must be considered, as must the interplay of light, shadow, and translucence of each individual element. Great care is taken to use biologi? cal reality as a point of reference and depar- ture for hair and feathers. In this regard, indi? vidual morphology, as well as fur and feather tracts are used by modelers and digital art- ists. However, certain compromises are in- evitably encountered. Examples of the solu? tions to these difficulties are demonstrated from the film Stuart Little and other projects. 800-955-1236 ? (703)790-1745 ?

In bird eggs, rates of gas exchange across the shell are limited by diffusion and, thus, a function of the physical properties of the shell and the surrounding environment (i.e. conductance, surface area:volume ra? tio). As metabolic rates increase over the incubation period oxygen demand may even? tually exceed oxygen supply and ultimately limit metabolism. In many birds a plateau in metabolic rate is reached prior to hatching and this plateau may be a function of oxy? gen limitation. I tested this hypothesis by incubating American coot eggs in hyperoxic (60% 02) and normoxic (21 % 02) conditions. Metabolic rates of eggs incubated in hyperoxic conditions were greater than metabolic rates of eggs in normoxic condi? tions during the last two days prior to con? vective breathing. This suggests that me? tabolism is compromised by diffusion of oxy? gen across the shell late in incubation and the plateau phase of metabolic rates is due to oxygen limitation. Hatchlings from the hyperoxic treatment were heavier than hatchlings from the normoxic treatment, how? ever most of this mass difference was due chicks from the hyperoxic incubation envi? ronment having more water in their tissues than chicks from the normoxic incubation en? vironment.

Survivorship of zebrafish, Danio rerio, was measured during lethal hypoxic stress after pre-treatment in water at either ambi? ent oxygen or at a lowered, but non-lethal, level of oxygen. Acclimation to non-lethal hypoxia (ca. 10% air-saturation) for 48 h sig? nificantly extended survival time during more severe hypoxia (ca. 5% air-saturation) com? pared to survival of individuals with no prior hypoxic exposure. The magnitude of the acclimation effect depended upon the sex of the fish; hypoxia pre-treatment increased the survival times of males by a factor of ap? proximately 9, and that of females by a fac- tor of 3, relative to controls. In addition, sur? vival time of control and hypoxia acclimated fish depended upon when in the year ex? periments were conducted. Survival times were 2 to 3 times longer when measured in the late fall or winter compared to survival times measured during the spring or sum? mer. These results demonstrate a direct sur? vival benefit of short-term acclimation to hy? poxia in this genetically-tractable fish. The fact that the acclimation effect depended upon the sex of the fish and the season dur? ing which experiments were conducted demonstrates that other genetic and/or en? vironmental factors affect hypoxia tolerance in this species.

Is intron 2 of the fundulus lactate dehydrogenase B gene a hypoxia responsive element? Previous studies have shown that liver lactate dehydrogenase B (LDH-B) activity increases during hypoxic exposure of F heteroclitus. Several glycolytic genes in mammals are known to be upregulated dur? ing hypoxia via the binding of hypoxia-in- ducible factor (HIF-1) to a conserved se? quence motif, the hypoxia responsive ele? ment (HRE). The F heteroclitus Ldh-B gene contains a putative HRE in the second in? tron, which might be involved in the up-regu- lation of this gene in response to hypoxia. We used two complementary approaches to evaluate this hypothesis. First, we rea- soned that if this DNA element were func? tionally important it would be conserved among multiple species. Therefore, we se? quenced intron 2 of Ldh-B hom 13 species in the genus Fundulus. The 3' region of the intron was highly conserved and contained 2 putative HREs and a sequence similar to the mammalian cyclic AMP responsive ele? ment (CRE). The number and spacing of these elements is virtually identical to the arrangement of elements in the hypoxia re? sponsive promoter of mammalian Ldh-A. In addition, we assessed the capacity of this 1184 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Although the addition of intron 2 upstream of the minimal Ldh-B pro? moter led to a marginal increase in reporter gene expression during normoxia, intron 2 failed to enhance gene expression under hypoxia. In this experiment, however, there was no increase in LDH-B enzyme activity, suggesting that the fish may have responded behaviorally or physiologically to environ? mental hypoxia in such a way as to mini? mize tissue hypoxia. We are currently ex? ploring the operation of Ldh-B intron 2 as an HRE in cell culture. Supported by National Science Foundation grant IBN 9723050. P1.54REESE, S. A.*, CROCKER, C E, CARWILE, M.

Habitat selection and the physi? ology of hibernation in common map turtles (Graptemys geographica). We submerged map turtles (Graptemys geographica) from Wisconsin in water equili? brated with air (normoxic) and in water equili? brated with nitrogen (anoxic) at 3?C. Before submergence and for periods up to 150 days of submergence, plasma P02, PC02, pH, [CI ], [Na+], [K+], total Mg, total Ca, lactate, glu? cose, and osmolality were measured; he- matocrit and body mass were determined, and plasma [HC03 ] was calculated. Turtles in anoxic water developed a severe meta? bolic acidosis, accumulating lactate from a predive value of 1.7 to 116 mmol/L, associ? ated with a fail in pH from 8.010 to 7.128. Total calcium and magnesium rose from 3.5 and 2.0 to 25.7 and 7.6 mmol/L, respectively, helping to buffer the accumulating lactate. Plasma [HC03] was titrated from 44.7 to 4.3 mmol/L in anoxic turtles. Only minor distur? bances occured in those turtles submerged in normoxic water; there was a marked in? crease in hematocrit from 31.1 to 51.9%. We suggest that map turtles have an obligatory requirment for a hibernaculum that provides well-oxygenated water and that this require? ment is important in determining their distri? bution.

The demand for human anatomical ma? terial in teaching at the undergraduate and professional school level is enormous, as attested to by the sheer volume of (expen? sive) textbooks, manuals and study aids on the market and the number of academic positions whose primary teaching respon- sibilities involve medical and allied health students. There exists a widespread misperception by many academics that hu? man anatomy consists simply of rate memo- rization; in truth, assisting students in com? ing to terms with the complexities of human morphology and movement in three dimen? sions continues to present the greatest chal? lenge for medical educators. Advances in computer graphic capa-bilites in recent years should have revolutionised anatomi? cal teaching by allowing students to view and manipulate quasi three-dimensional digital humans. However, existing anatomi? cal software suffers from curious and pro? nounced limitations arising from a typologi- cal and inherently two-dimensional peda- gogical approach. Despite the need, the de? velopment of new software is limited by a cost of development which exceeds typical academic resources. In this regard, the vast resources of the entertainment industry can benefit educators. In consultation with aca? demics and medical professionals, Sony Imageworks created a dynamic digital hu? man (and gorilla) as part of the computer graphics effects for the Sony film Hollow Man. This material represents one of the closest digital approximations of human musculo? skeletal morphology and dynamics to date, and will be a resource for teaching (and in? deed research) applications when fully de? veloped for the educational domain.

Both species exhibited a striking pattern of asymetrical activation of a specific set of ab? dominal wall and epipubic muscles sum- ming to produce a linear pattern of contrac? tion spanning diagonal fore- and hind limb pairs during the time they are supporting the body during trotting gaits. In effect, a series of muscles contract diagonally to stiffen and bend the body during the time that a given diagonal couplet is on the ground. The epipubic bones move little and appear to act as a mid-abdominal strut serving to align and anchor the diagonal muscle array. The pectineus exhibits a peculiar pattern of iso? metric tetanus during locomotion.

Larval release behaviors of deca? pod crustaceans: similar responses in shrimp and crabs. Ovigerous brachyuran crustaceans re? spond to peptide pheromones from devel? oping embryos with stereotyped larval re? lease behavior. This behavior involves rhyth? mic motion ofthe pleopods (pumping), which ventilates the egg mass and facilitates hatch? ing of the embryos. We conducted behav? ioral studies using two European shrimp species, Paleomon serratus and Crangon vulgaris, and the North American grass shrimp Palaemonetes vulgaris to determine whether shrimp responses parallel pub? lished observations of brachyuran crabs. Focal stimulation of pleopods with crushed embryo extracts evoked pumping behavior in all 3 shrimp species. The rate of pumping in response to the stimulus increased with increasing embryo concentration. Bradyki- nin, a larval release peptide mimic, also evoked increased pumping responses in P. serratus and C. vulgaris. These results are consistent with observations of brachyuran crabs. In P serratus, focal stimulation of aestetasc hairs evoked flicking of the anten? nules, whereas stimulation of the first walk? ing legs evoked feeding responses; neither stimulated pumping. These results indicate that the receptors that mediate pumping behavior in shrimp are located on the pleo? pods. P3.23A REITZEL,AM,MINER,B.G.; Uni? versity of Florida. Spawning times and the importance of development time in life his? tory models of marine invertebrates. Trade-offs between fecundity and devel? opment time have been used in life history models to predict the optimal amount of maternal energy to supply eggs. However, there is very little evidence to support that selection favors shorter development time. Other factors like juvenile fitness, exogenous food, larval transport, and fertilization suc- 1186 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="263">cess may influence the evolution of life his? tory and maternal reserves. Here we indi- rectly test the importance of development time on spawning season. In particular, we look at spawning times in species of marine invertebrates with lecithotrophic larvae (non- feeding). We assume species with lecithotrophic larvae will be more flexible in the time in which they can spawn, since lar? vae can develop when food is present or not. Additionally, without the need to feed, temperature will most influence develop? ment time. We therefore predict that species that produce lecithotrophic larvae will spawn just prior to the warmest seasonal seawater temperatures. However, other selective pressures may be important if lecithotrophic larvae develop during colder months. We surveyed spawning times for species with planktotrophic (feeding), lecithotrophic, and brooded larvae from the Pacific Northwest. Water temperatures for ten years were com? pared to spawning times to test our predic? tion. Species with planktotrophic larvae typi? cally spawned throughout spring and sum? mer. Species with lecithotrophic larvae were mostly restricted to the months June through August, with the exception of annelids. Spe? cies with brooded larvae were typically found to brood year around. Water temperatures and spawning time did not match the pre? diction that development time influences spawning times and are not consistent with the theoretical model's parameters.

Captive starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were used to examine the effects of exogenous insulin and corticosterone administration on plasma metabolite levels in response to stress, and how these responses varied over the course of the day and season. Starlings were captured from the wild during the win? ter, held on short days (11L13D - mimicking winter), and then shifted to long days (19L5D - mimicking summer). Levels of corticoster? one (CORT), glucose, and triglycerides were measured in blood plasma. Basal samples were taken within 3 min of disturbance and subsequent concentrations were measured 40, 70, and 150 min following handling stress and injection of exogenous saline, in? sulin or CORT. Both triglyceride and CORT concentrations responded to handling and restraint stress in control (saline-injected) birds when monitored at both morning and night, while control birds only exhibited stress-induced hyperglycemia at night (23:00) and not during the day (11:00). Basal CORT levels were higher at night than dur? ing the day, opposite of the circadiel varia? tion in basal glucose concentrations, and triglycerides showed no daily variation. In? jected insulin did not affect circulating CORT or triglyceride concentrations but significantly lowered plasma glucose (hypoglycemia). In? jected insulin + injected CORT did not affect triglyceride concentrations but CORT ap? peared to hasten plasma glucose recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycemia. These findings provide evidence of a possible per- missive role of glucocorticoids in the stress response in birds. P3.106A REMAGE-HEALEY, L, ROMERO, LM, Cornell University, Tufts University. Cor? ticosterone and insulin interact to regulate glucose and lipid concentrations during stress in starlings undergoing molt. Captive starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) un? dergoing a prebasic molt (the costly replace? ment of body feathers) were given exog? enous insulin and corticosterone (CORT) to determine how counterregulatory hormones alter glucose and triglycerides during stress. Experiments were conducted at both morn? ing (11:00) and night (23:00) to monitor daily variation in responses. Concentrations of CORT, glucose and triglycerides were mea? sured in blood plasma at &lt;3 min (basal) and at three time points over 2.5 hours thereafter (stress-induced) to monitor the effect of in? jected saline, insulin or CORT. Birds were exposed to handling and restraint stress, which caused an increase in CORT con? centrations, a decrease in triglycerides, but had no effect on circulating glucose. Circadiel (daily) variation was not evident in CORT or glucose, but concentrations of trig? lycerides were higher at night than during the day. Insulin markedly suppressed glu? cose concentrations, and had no effect on 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Injected CORT hastened the recovery of glucose concentrations from insulin-induced hy? poglycemia, while CORT had no effect on plasma triglycerides. Exogenous CORT also produced considerable hyperglycemia in the absence of injected insulin, and this ef? fect was demonstrated at both times-of-day. Basal concentrations of CORT, glucose and triglycerides exhibited circannual (seasonal) variation when combined with data from an earlier study of starlings held on short and long days. During the energetically-costly prebasic molt, all three indicators were at lower basal concentrations than during simu? lated winter (short days) or summer (long days). These results further demonstrate the substantial alteration of metabolism and stress physiology in birds undergoing molt, and present evidence for a permissive role of glucocorticoids during stress.

In immature specimens of the pteropod mollusk Clione limacina, the right pleural ganglion is slightly larger than the left. The average diameter of the former is 180um, while that of the latter is 160um. The right-to- left diameter ratio is 1.13. In mature ani? mals, average diameters are 300um for the right ganglion and 200um for the left, for a right-to-left diameter ratio of 1.50. A left-to- left ganglion comparison of mature vs. im? mature animals yields a diameter ratio of 1.25, while a right-to-right ganglion compari? son gives a ratio of 1.67. Thus, the right pleu? ral ganglion grows out of proportion to the left with development of sexual maturity. Cell counts were conducted to determine if the increase in size was due to an increase of cell number, an increase in cell size, or both. Initial cell counts utilizing the fluorescent nuclear dye, Hoechst 33342, indicate a sig? nificant increase in cell number in the right pleural ganglion when comparing immature to mature animals. The sexual maturity-on- set changes in the pleural ganglia parallel significant development of both male and female reproductive structures.

In the snail Lymnaea stagnalis, hemocyte activation is correlated with a rapid shift in cytoskeletal organization that facilitates amoeboid movement and cell aggregation. Activation involves characteristic stages: 1) substrate attachment, 2) spreading/flatten- ing out, 3) generation of lamellipodia/ filipodia, 4) random motility, 5) directed mo- tility/phagocytosis, and 6) hemocyte aggre- gation/fibroblast-like morphology. Previ? ously, a chelating buffer (containing 2 mM Na2-EDTA) was shown to prevent hemocyte aggregation (Adema et al., Dev. Comp. Immunol. 18: 25-31, 1994). We employed this buffer to examine the effects of lowering extracellular Ca2+ on the time course of hemocyte activation and the shift in organi? zation of microfilaments/microtubules. In the presence of the chelating buffer hemocytes were slower to attach to the substrate, but reached stage 3 in roughly the same time (5-10 min) as control preparations. After 15 min of exposure to EDTA, however, most hemocytes began to round up (reverting to stage 1) and their degree of microfilament/ microtubule organization was significantly decreased. These results support our hy? pothesis that Ca2+ concentration, perhaps mediated by Ca2+-binding proteins, under? lie the cytoskeletal changes associated with hemocyte activation. 11.1 RIEHLE, M.

Six lines of high temperature (41.5/C) adapted Escherichia coli were screened for gene duplications and dele- tions using DNA high-density array technol? ogy. Three of the six selected lines contain a region of gene duplication at least 23.7 kb in size at the 59th minute of the chromosome. This duplicated region contains genes that 1188 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="265">have previously been shown to enhance sta- tionary phase survival under benign or stressful conditions and to help in the repair of damaged proteins. Expression of two candidate genes in the lines with the gene duplication is significantly elevated over ancestral expression levels. In the two cases where the duplication at 2.85MB has been furthered characterized, the timing of the ge? nome reorganization is coincident with sig? nificant increases in relative fitness. These six lines of high temperature adapted bacte? ria have now spent 2000 additional genera? tions back at their ancestral temperature of 37/C and we will determine (1) how their relative fitness has changed at both high temperature and at 37/C and (2) whether the bacteria still contain the duplication at the 59th minute that originated during the 2000 generations at high temperature or have they reverted back to their ancestral haploid state.

Lead analysis of snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) hatchlings exposed to lead ni? trate at various times during incubation. Eggs from three female snapping turtles were incubated in sand with a water content of 4% by mass. This is equivalent to being exposed to a water potential of -7 kPa. Three eggs from each female were exposed to lead nitrate for 48 hours on days 0,15,21,30,40, and 50 of incubation. A 0.01 M lead nitrate solution was used to wet the sand to 4% water content. The eggs were then incu? bated in the absence of lead nitrate for the remainder of incubation. The hatchings were subsequently sacrificed and analyzed for lead. Hatchlings that were exposed to lead nitrate at the beginning of incubation had high levels of lead (1.54 ppm) while hatchlings that were incubated after day fif- teen had lead levels (0.050 ppm) not signifi? cantly different from the controls (0.043 ppm). During the time of exposure to the lead ni? trate, the eggs did take up water. These re? sults support the hypothesis that egg water exchange during the later stages of incuba- tion should be in the vapor phase, so as not to interfere with gas exchange.

In marine soft-sediment habitats, chemi? cal sensing by deposit feeding organisms most likely plays a critical role in feeding behavior, yet few specifics about this role and its ecological implications are known. As part of a multi-disciplinary investigation of chemoreception in the spionid polycha? ete Polydora quadrilobata, we have identi? fied several phagostimulatory chemical cues. Using glass beads as a proxy for sediment, we tested for feeding responses to a se? lected number of potential cues that might be used to indicate food availability or qual? ity. We presented two sets of beads to indi? vidual intact worms: one with and one with? out covalently bound compounds such as single amino acids, mixtures of amino ac? ids, and single simple sugars. Worms were exposed to the beads under slow flowing seawater so that any dissolved cues were flushed from the test chamber. Each worm was videotaped for fifteen minutes immedi? ately following the addition of beads and these records were scored for the time the worm spent in a variety of behaviors. Re? sponses to beads with and without cues were compared to identify compounds as stimulatory, inhibitory, or inactive. Cues elic- iting significant behavioral responses will be used in future neurobiological examinations of this species to identify and localize chemoreceptor cells.

In two wild D. melanogaster populations studied, approxi? mately 10% of adult flies reared from field- collected fruit had severe developmental anomalies of wing and abdominal morphol? ogy. The frequency of developmental ab? normalities varied along a natural thermal gradient, reaching 4% in adults eclosing from larvae developing in cool, shaded fruit and exceeding 12% for flies from warm, sunlit fruit. Heat-induced wing deformities dramati? cally reduced mating success in male flies. When exposed to strong natural heat stress, D. melanogaster with the wild-type number of Hsp70 genes (10) had higher rates of lar? val mortality and developmental disruption than a transgenic sister strain with additional (22) copies of the Hsp70 gene. However, under conditions of little or moderate natu? ral thermal stress, larvae possessing 22 Hsp70copies had higher mortality rates than larvae possessing 10 Hsp70 copies. These results support the hypothesis of an evolu? tionary trade-off of the benefits and adverse consequences of Hsp70 expression.

Experimental investigation into the effect of chemical signals in the nervous system of crayfish has shown certain neurotransmit- ters, such as seratonin and dopamine, have the capability of altering the aggressive ten- dencies of crayfish in a hierarchical commu? nity. While such studies are becoming well documented, a third group of polypeptide neurotransmitters, enkephalins, have gone relatively unstudied. Enkephalins are be? lieved to function in a manner echoing that of seratonin and dopamine, however, the lack of research into these chemical signals provides only a small platform from which to embark onto further study. The goals of this study are two fold. First, it attempts to deter? mine the relative dispersion of Met-enkepha? lin in the crayfish eye stalk, where unusually large amounts of enkephalins have been reported. Secondly, it strives to identify the specific location of high concentration cen? ters of the neurotransmitter in the hopes of lending information towards the functioning of these chemicals within the crayfish ner? vous system and possible behavioral effects caused by the presence of the neurotrans? mitter. Results appear to indicate localiza? tion of enkephalin or enkephalin-like mol? ecules within the eye stalk, depicting speci? fied use of the neurotransmitter. Ultimately, the wide range of organisms that utilize en- kephalins in their nervous systems provides a strong possibility for extrapolation of en? kephalin effects to other complex organisms form a crayfish basis. 22.1 ROBERTS, T.J.*, SCALES, J.A., Or? egon State University. The source of power for acceleration in turkeys. Many of the features that make some muscle-tendon units effective as springs during running - long tendons, short muscle fibers, articulations across more than one joint - may make them ill-suited to perform- ing mechanical work. It has been suggested that the work required for activities such as uphill running or acceleration is produced by long-fibered muscles of distal limb seg? ments. We measured the work done at indi? vidual joints in wild turkeys during accelera? tion to determine which muscles provide the work of acceleration. Force-plate and high- speed video measurements were used to measure joint work during single footfalls as turkeys accelerated along a 10 meter track? way. The net work per step at the hip and the ankle increased in direct proportion to the rate of acceleration. At the ankle, a decrease in joint flexion and an increase in joint ex? tension contributed to the total increase in net work output. Hip work was increased by increasing the joint extension from an aver? age of 12? during steady speed running to above 40? at the strongest accelerations. The knee and tarsometatarsal-phalangeal joint did not contribute to the work of accelera? tion, as net work output at these joints was independent of acceleration rate. Net work produced for the most rapid accelerations averaged 0.9 J/kg body mass at the hip and 0.8 J/kg body mass at the ankle. The large muscle masses at the ankle and the hip ap- 1190 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="267">pear to be equally important for providing the work necessary for acceleration. The high work output of ankle extensors indi? cates that while long tendons and short fi? bers may improve a musclei's ability to de? velop force economically, they do not nec? essarily limit its ability to perform mechani? cal work.

About 12 kb from an isolate with a genome totaling approximately 16-20 kb was sequenced. The contiguous stretch contains the genes for 11 tRNAs, 2 rRNA genes, 4 protein coding genes (NADH dehydrogenase 1, NADH dehydrogenase 2, ATPase 6, and cyto? chrome b).The remaining sequence appears to be non-coding.

Differential expres? sion of actin isoforms during intestinal re? generation in the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima. The regeneration capability of echino? derms is well known, however, few stud? ies have focused on the cellular and mo? lecular events underlying this phenom? enon. We are using the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima as a model system to elucidate the molecular aspects of re? generation. Differential display analysis between normal and regenerated tissues produced a series of bands preferentially expressed in the regenerated tissue. These bands were used as probes to screen a regenerated tissue cDNA expres? sion library, from which two actin cDNA clones, HgActl (2.0 Kb) and HgAct2 (2.2 Kb), were obtained. A possible third actin isoform HgAct3 (280 Bp) was cloned by PCR using rat actin primers. Two lines of evidence suggest that HgActl and HgAct2 are different isoforms: partial sequence analysis, including the 3i UTR, show no significant similarities between them and northern blots with one probe show mul? tiple bands with differential expression patterns at various regeneration stages. A prominent signal of approximately 2.5 Kb shows an up-regulation during early intestinal regeneration when compared to late regenerate and normal tissues. The expression of actin isoforms is known to be developmentally regulated during em? bryogenesis in vertebrate and invertebrate deuterostomes, but few studies have ad- dressed their regulation during regenera? tion.

Convergent evolution in the vas? cular systems of three marine mammals. Conservation of thermal energy in aquatic mammals is essential for the main? tenance of high core temperatures in a heat conducting aquatic environment. Seals, dol? phins, and manatees have gross morpho? logical adaptations such as large size, modi? fication of appendages, and blubber to con? serve body heat. Additionally, they possess vascular countercurrent heat exchangers in their extremities. Nevertheless, the need for heat conservation is balanced by an equally important need for selective heat dissipa- tion to protect susceptible organs, such as the testes and epididymides, from hyperther- mic insult. Seals, dolphins, and manatees are ascrotal, increasing the potential for hy- perthermic insult. However, specialized vas? cular designs enable the selective cooling of these thermally sensitive tissues. Vascu? lar structures that prevent reproductive hy- perthermic insult in seals, dolphins, and manatees are reviewed and physiological evidence to support these anatomical ob? servations is presented. Each of these ma? rine mammals possesses vascular shunts associated with the testes and epididymides. These shunts are parallel to the countercur? rent heat exchangers, connecting superfi? cial vascular beds and deep vascular plex- uses. The thermo-vascular "circumventions" are convergent adaptations across three diving mammalian groups with independent evolutionary histories. 15.3 ROSEN, G. *, WADE, J, Michigan State University, EastLansing. Androgen metabo? lism in the green anole lizard brain. 5ALPHA-reductase facilitates male court? ship behavior in green anole lizards by con- verting testosterone (T) to dihydrotes- tosterone. The present study was done to determine whether sex and seasonal differ? ences in the enzymefs activity occur in the anole brain, reflecting its role in male court? ship behavior. The pattern of expression also was assessed for aromatase, which con- verts T to 17BETA-estradiol. Multiple assays were done to compare enzyme activities in the following: 1) breeding males and breed? ing females; 2) breeding males and non- breeding males; 3) non-breeding males and non-breeding females. Enzyme activity was assayed in homogenates of individual whole brains. 5ALPHA-reductase was also as? sessed in brainstem homogenates, since this region contains the greatest level of ac? tivity for this enzyme. Breeding males, breed? ing females and non-breeding males had equivalently high 5ALPHA-reductase activ? ity. In contrast, breeding males had greater aromatase activity than breeding females and non-breeding males. The results are generally consistent with those of other ver? tebrate species in which sex and seasonal differences are present in aromatase, but not 5ALPHA-reductase. The greater aromatase activity in breeding males indi? cates that this enzyme might mediate male- specific functions, although the behavioral relevance of this enzyme in male anoles is unclear. The high levels of 5ALPHA-reduc- tase activity in both sexes suggests that the enzyme might have important functions in females as well as in males. 3.1 ROSENBERGER, L * J, WALKER, J.

Critical swimming speed ranged from about 3 body lengths per second up to greater than 5 bl/s in the taxa sampled. Fin shape is a major determinant of labriform propulsion mechanics, as wrasses range from extremely paddle-like fins (e.g. Tautoga with an AR of 1.5) to highly tapered and wing- like fins (e.g. Gomphosus with an AR of 3.5). To assess differences in kinematics of spe? cies on the rowing to flapping continuum, we calculated stroke plane angle, frequency and amplitude in all species. Our results show that maximum pectoral-fin-powered swimming speeds were higher in wrasses that had a more vertical stroke plane angle and higher aspect ratio (more wing-like) fins. Recent models suggest that there may be a trade-off between swimming performance and rapid force production for higher ma? neuverability that may have resulted in re? peated evolution of these two alternative strategies in the family Labridae.

Many tropical marine invertebrate ani? mals harbor endosymbiotic algae. Reef- building corals are the best-studied of these symbioses. These corals host zoox? anthellae that are far dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium. Earlier views of cor? als as "one host-one symbiont" associa? tions have been challenged by molecular studies of zooxanthellar taxonomy, which show that some coral species encompass more than one species of Symbiodinium. The non-random distribution of these poly? morphic symbioses implies that corals ac? climatize to different environments by host- ing differently-adapted Symbiodinium spp. Examples from the Caribbean (corals in the Montastraea annularis species com? plex) and the Pacific (the coral Pocillopora damicornis) will be presented. Disturbance experiments on M. annularis imply that their zooxanthellae include species of Symbiodinium that range from "weeds" to narrowly-adapted specialists, whose dy? namics may have parallels with the dy? namics of plant communities. An under? standing of these processes is relevant to predicting the response of corals and coral reefs to climate change. 35.4 RUBEGA, M.A*, HEATH, KM, Uni? versity of Connecticut, Storrs. Skeletal de? velopment in hatchling avocets and stilts: the effects of salt stress on growth and ossifica? tion. Post-hatching skeletal development in non-galliform precocial birds is less well- known than is embryonic development, and the effects of stress during growth are even less studied. Many studies have shown that high salinity levels are lethal to hatchling birds, but the effects of sublethal levels of salt stress on ultimate adult form and func? tion are completely unknown. We examined normal and salt-stressed American avocet (Recurvirostra americana) and black- necked stilt (Himantopus mexicanus) chicks (0-14 days post-hatching) for the effects of salt stress on skeletal development. Mea? surements of cleared and stained speci? mens revealed that salt stress stunted growth in avocets, but did not suppress ossification. Salt-stressed avocets were smaller because of reduced bone growth, but proportionally more ossified because ossification pro- ceeded despite salt stress. The patterns of salinity effects on the development of the skeleton in stilts were more ambiguous. These patterns suggest that the ontogeny of ossification may be invariant, and thus may partly explain observations of reduced ulti? mate adult size in birds subjected to other forms of stress during the postnatal growth phase.

The trauma results from gas bubbles in the vas? cular system and other locations, causing a variety of physiological problems. Much 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Previous studies have examined the susceptibility of juvenile and adult fishes, but little work has been done to determine the response of developing stages to gas supersatu- rated conditions. This study focused on the exposure of embryos and newly hatched fry of the Japanese Medaka, Oryzias latipes, to very low gas supersatu- rations (ranging from 102 to 110% satura? tion). The gas supersaturation was estab? lished using a bubble column and was maintained for days at a time. Water was pumped from the aquarium and forced down an inner PVC pipe, exiting near the bottom of the column into an outer pipe, then ascended between the two pipes to the exit point and back to the tank. Air wands within the pipes generated the gas supersaturation. Each individual embryo or fry was observed daily for the diagnos? tic features of gas bubble disease and any other developmental abnormalities. In addition, digital images of each organism were analyzed in order to quantify the size of any gas bubbles or abnormalities present. Preliminary results show only a small percentage (&lt;5%) of the embryos and fry exposed to these conditions showed abnormalities, none of which were characteristic of gas bubble trauma. In addition, no internal gas bubbles were observed. Further study is needed to fully characterize the response of the embryos to these potentially lethal environmental conditions.

Such interspecific intimacy can have diverse evo? lutionary outcomes, ranging from antagonis- tic interactions (parasitisms and pathogenic associations) to mutualistic ones. Even when well understood (and many are not), the dy- namics of many symbiotic associations re? sist simple definition. Many multi-partner symbioses embrace both antagonistic and mutualistic species interactions within a single association.Many others vary in their effects over time and space, depending on the particular environmental conditions, de? velopmental stages, and species partners involved; such examples suggest that the boundary between antagonistic and mutu? alistic symbiosis can be a thin and variable one. Recent symbiosis research, particu? larly on mycorrhizae and coral-dinoflagel- late symbioses, but also on numerous other systems, has revealed, with compelling and instructive detail, the depth and extent of the ecological and evolutionary complexities of symbiont interactions in both plant and ani? mal hosts. Ongoing investigations also con? tinue to confirm the geographical and taxo? nomic ubiquity, and ecological and evolu? tionary (including agricultural and medical) importance of both parasitic and mutualistic symbioses. Drawing on symbiosis research on plant and animal (as well as computer) hosts, from marine, freshwater and terres? trial habitats, and on integration of molecu? lar, ecological and systematic approaches, this symposium seeks to explore the com- monalities between parasitic and mutualis? tic symbioses, and also to gather fresh in? sights from exploration of their differences.

Most effects of atmospheric C02 increase arise indirectly as a result of photosynthetic stimulation, inhibition of respiration, or im? proved water use efficiency. Only the guard cells that control stomatal function are known to directly sense variation in C02 and trans- duce it into a regulated response. High C02 reduces stomatal aperture, while low C02 increases it. The mechanism of this signal- transduction response remains unclear. At the level of the internal leaf biochemistry, the expression of only a few enzymes may be directly regulated by C02 level. For example, 1194 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="271">carbonic anhydrase expression is reduced by high C02, but the mechanism for this control is also unclear. Increasing C02 pro? motes photosynthesis through its effect as a substrate in carbon fixation and as an in? hibitor of photorespiration. Long-term (weeks to years) exposure to high C02 in? creases leaf carbohydrate status, which in turn reduces photosynthetic gene expres? sion, causing a decline in photosynthetic ca? pacity. This reduction in photosynthetic ca? pacity is the main acclimation response to high C02, and is similar to acclimation re? sponses to other environmental agents that promote carbohydrate accumulation. Fac? tors that affect carbohydrate accumulation following transfer to high C02 modulate the strength of the acclimation response. For example, low sink capacity and low nutrient status promote carbohydrate accumulation and a strong C02 acclimation response. Carbohydrates status alone does not drive C02 acclimation. Instead, it appears leaves must be primed to respond to high levels of carbohydrate, probably by long-distance signals such as ABAand cytokinins that are sent from the roots and other sinks. Identify? ing the mechanisms of interaction between carbohydrate status, plant hormones and other developmental signals is a major re- quirement for understanding how plants will respond to atmospherie C02 enrichment. 35.1 SAGE, R.F*, SAGE, T.L, University of Toronto. Microsites characteristics of Muhlenbergia richardsonis, an alpine c4 plant. C4 plants are uncommon in cold envi? ronments at high latitude and altitude, and are not generally thought to occur in the alpine tundra. In the White Mountains of California, we found that the C4 grass Muhlenbergia richardsonis commonly oc? curs in the alpine zone at 3300 to 3800 m, with the highest population observed 3950 m above sea level. This is the highest re? ported C4 plant population in North America, and is near the world altitude lim? its (4000 to 4200 m) reported for C4 plants in Asia and the Andes. At its highest distri? bution (3600 to 3950 m), M. richardsonis is restricted to southeast and southwest facing slopes, with greatest frequency on southeast faces. Muhlenbergia richard- sonis plants form low mats with mean height of 2.7 cm, while co-occurring C3 grasses form bunches that are on aver? age two to three times taller. As a result, M. richardsonis leaves are more affected by the boundary layer of the soil than nearby C3 grasses. Temperature of M. richardsonis leaves was over 20/C above air temperature in full sun and still air, and 10/C above air temperature in full sun and wind. As a result, midday leaf tempera? tures in M. richardsonis were routinely observed to be 25/C to 35/C, conditions favorable to C4 photosynthesis. At night, the high boundary layer in the Muhlenbergia mats allows for 5/ to 15/C reduction of leaf temperature below air temperature, resulting in regular frosting of leaves. These results indicate that M. richardsonis requires daytime heating for ecological success, and has evolved the capacity for freezing tolerance at night and early in the day. The ability to withstand regular freezing suggests that minimum daily temperature alone cannot account for the general absence of the C4 path? way in cold environments. Instead, a fea? ture associated with the daytime heat re? quirement of the C4 pathway may be more important. 57.4 SALVANTE, K.G.*, WILLIAMS, T.D, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada. Hormonal control of reproduction: effects of corticosterone on timing of laying, egg size, clutch size, and yolk precursor lev? els. Egg formation involves major adjust? ments in lipid metabolism, including an upregulation of total lipoprotein synthesis, and production of a specific yolk-targeted very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL), and vitellogenin (VTG). Corticosterone (B) is known to be involved in regulating many aspects of lipid metabolism in non-reproduc- tive animals, including increased fat depo? sition in the liver and adipose tissue and hyperglycemia. We therefore investigated whether B is involved in regulating or modu? lating lipoprotein production and metabo? lism during yolk formation, and the effect of 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

P2.50SANDERS, N.K*, MAYO, M., STUART, J, Truman State University. Truman State University students and evolution: a survey. Recent media attention has refocused the American public on the teaching of evo? lution in public schools. Nationwide, differ? ences in state standards for science educa? tion offer a wide variety of possibilities of how to teach about evolution n or not - for public school science teachers. Truman State Uni? versity in northeast Missouri is public liberal arts school in a state that does not mention evolution in the state science standards. Student writing assignments in introductory biology over an 8 year period led to my per- ception that many Truman students know little about the science of evolution, and have many major misconceptions about this theory. A survey was designed to elucidate attitudes toward and understanding of evo? lution by students in Truman biology classes. We predicted that non major biology students would have the least understanding of evo? lution, and senior biology majors in the capstone course would have the greatest understanding. Preliminary data support this prediction. 40.6 SANDERSON, S.L*, CHEER, A.Y, GOODRICH, J.S., GRAZIANO, J.D, CALLAN, W.T., College of William and Mary, University of California, Davis, Princeton University, Howard University, College of William and Mary. How do gill rakers func? tion in suspension-feeding fishes? Gill rakers have been assumed to serve as either (1) a sieve that accumulates par? ticles larger than the mesh size or (2) a sticky filter that retains particles encountered via a hydrosol filtration mechanism. However, our video endoscopy (30 - 250 Hz) in the oral cavities of freely-swimming fish during pump suspension feeding demonstrates that the rakers of species belonging to three fami? lies (gizzard shad, Dorosoma cepedianum; goldfish, Carassius auratus; ngege tilapia, Oreochromis esculentus) do not function as a sieve or as a sticky filter. The gill rakers of pump suspension-feeding Sacramento blackfish (Orthodon microlepidotus) have been hypothesized to serve as a barrier to fluid flow, directing particle-laden water to the sticky oral roof where particles are trapped (Science 251: 1346-1348, 1991). However, our use of computational fluid dy? namics to simulate flow in the vicinity of rak? ers at intermediate Reynolds numbers (250 - 500) shows that the rakers of pump sus? pension-feeding fishes are leaky, never serv- ing as a barrier to flow. Based on these re? sults, we propose a new model of filtration in suspension-feeding fishes.

Unsteady aerodynamic forces are important for pro? duction of force moments by flapping wings. Insects use aerodynamic forces not only to stay in air, but also to steer and maneuver. Through changes in wing kinematics, in? sects can finely control the pitch, roll and yaw moments around their body and thus maneuver. In a previous study, we used a mechanical model of a fly to study the influ? ence of wing kinematics on unsteady force generation. In this study, we extend the analysis to include moments generated dur? ing single strokes. To address how unsteady force mechanisms such as delayed stall, wake capture and wing rotation affect mo? ments, we used an extensive data set of aerodynamic forces corresponding to differ- 1196 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="273">ent kinematic patterns, and calculated the resulting instantaneous pitch, roll and yaw moments throughout the stroke. For the ki? nematics that generated maximum lift, we identified sub-regions where pitch, roll or yaw are most sensitive to changes in stroke amplitude, angle of attack, flip timing, flip duration and deviation from mean stroke plane, respectively. First, for fixed flip dura? tion and flip timing, all three moments were sensitive to variation in stroke amplitude and angle of attack within a kinematic range where lift is sufficient to support body weight. Second, for fixed stroke amplitude and angle of attack, roll moments vary little with changes in flip timing or flip duration. How? ever, pitch and yaw moments are sensitive to changes in flip timing and duration. Third, for fixed stroke amplitude, angle of attack, flip timing and flip duration, all three moments are very sensitive to variation in the devia? tion from mean stroke plane. This suggests that changes in stroke deviation may be an excellent strategy for manipulation of mo? ments around an insect's body. P2.9 SANSTAD, E.A., JARZAB, D.M., LeCLAIR, E.E., DePaul University. A cDNA catalog of turtle shell development. In turtles, the cranial and postcranial der? mal bones are remarkably similar in struc? ture, containing both sutures and plates. This leads to the question of how the vertebrate gene families that regulate mesodermal fate and intramembraneous bone formation have been co-opted to a different role in turtle shells. Using histological techniques we have cleared and stained the shells of de? veloping turtle embryos (Chrysemys scripta) after 2 weeks, 3 weeks,5 weeks and 7 weeks of incubation. This allows us to study the progress of ossification as the shell devel? ops. Next, we have created three tissue- specific cDNA libraries from the lateral cara? pace ridge (which initiates shell develop? ment), the 3-week embryonic shell (cartilagi? nous phase) and the 5-week embryonic shell (ossification phase). After reverse tran? scription and long-distance PCR amplifica? tion, all cDNAs were directionally cloned into the ITriplEx2 vector (Clontech) and pack- aged into phage. Preliminary analysis of the amplified libraries show that the titers ex- ceed 4-8 million pfu/uL; randomly isolated phage were sequenced and found to con? tain mid-length (&gt;700 bp) turtle-specific cDNAs, including the 3' poly-A tail. These libraries are now being screened for genes involved in shell initiation (e.g. FGFs) and the regulation of growth at bony sutures (Msx, BMPs). Aliquots of these libraries are avail? able to interested researchers.

Muscle, neu? ral, and epithelial tissue variation between larval and presumptive juvenile structures in different species of actinotroch larvae (Phoronida). Actinotroch larvae exhibit variation among several characteristic traits at com? petence. These traits include the structure of the larval and juvenile tentacles and the muscular and neural components of the hood. All actinotrochs develop three me? dian hood nerves at competence, however there are at least two distinct types of neural structures associated with these nerves among different species. One is a second? ary neuropil and the other is a secondary nerve complex that contains scattered sero? tonergic cell bodies. Larval and presump? tive juvenile tentacles show different degrees of cellular integration among species. Cur? rently there are three known designs for the origin of the juvenile tentacles: the larval ten? tacles are remodeled into the juvenile ten? tacles, the juvenile tentacles develop from a basal primordium attached to the larval ten? tacles, or the juvenile tentacles are devel? oped as a separate set underneath the lar? val tentacles. All species from the two latter groups form lateral cilia on their juvenile ten? tacle primordia, but these cilia remain im- motile during larval life. The juvenile ten- tacular epithelium of one of these species also selectively labels for serotonin. Larval categories based on these characteristics do not directly correlate with generic group? ings or reproductive types of the adults ex? cept in the case of Phoronis architecta and R muelleri. These data also do not support the proposed synonymy of R architecta with P psammophila. 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Ori? gin and evolution of the tetra-odontiformes (teleostei, pisces), with an analysis of the patterns of speciation of the family triacanthodidae. Fossil evidence seems to point towards an origin in shallow waters, during the up? per Cretaceous, of several lineages of Acan- thopterygian fishes, which now are widely distributed in deep waters. Among these groups, we find the Zeiformes, the Caproiformes, and the Tetraodontiformes. This distributional shift probably happened after the K/T mass extinction. Possible sce? narios regarding the origin of one of these clades, the Tetraodontiformes, are presented and discussed. In addition to this, a phylo? genetic systematic analysis of one of these groups, the family Triacanthodidae (Tetraodontiformes, Teleostei) is being uti? lized to test the applicability to marine taxa of methodologies that rely on phylogenetic hypotheses and biogeographical distribu? tions to study patterns of speciation. A vari? ety of pioneering studies seem to suggest that the vast majority of speciation processes in terrestrial and freshwater taxa might be due to vicariant events. By contrast very pre? liminary work on marine organisms seems to indicate that different modes of specia- tions might be predominant in the sea, per? haps due to important differences in the re? productive biology of many marine organ? isms. The results of this study are presented and discussed. P3.15 SANTINI, F, University of Toronto. His? torical biogeography of coral reefs organ? isms: is the indonesian region a center of origin?

The analysis indicates that the Indo? nesian region, long thought to be a Acenter of origin? for most of the Indo-Western Pa? cific marine fauna, seems to be a very de- rived area, and that most of the lineages may have had their origins in the Eastern Indian Ocean or in the South-Western Pacific.

Cytotoxic studies of Fe and Zn compared with Hg on a monolayer of renal proximal tubular cells (PTC) and the evaluation of cytoprotectants. The toxicity effects of iron (III), zinc and Hg were evaluated between 0, 25, 50, 75, 100 mmol/l final concentrations on PTC in a monolayer culture. Assessment of cell viabil? ity used MTT (Thiazol blue) uptake as an indicator of mitochondrial membrane integ- rity, release of NAG (N-Acetyl-b-D- glucosaminidase) as an indicator of lysoso? mal damage, LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) as an indicator of plasma membrane integ- rity and DAPI staining for DNA fragmentation.Studies showed that Fe and Zn reduced cell viability maximally by 40 % and 30 % after 72 and 48 hrs incubation, whereas reduction for Hg was 95 % after 72 hrs at the concentration of 100 mmol/l re? spectively. Fe and Zn showed an increase (3.7 % and 11 %) in NAG activity, whereas Hg showed an inhibitory effect. All elements induced LDH release 2-3 fold. DNA frag? mentation by DAPI staining showed no dif? ference from control for Fe, but there was obvious nuclei condensation for Zn and Hg expressing a typical apoptosis model of cell death.Electron microscopy in treated cells with Fe showed no changes. However in Hg treated cells there was loss of brush bor? ders, the presence of vaccuolated cyto? plasm, disruption of mitochondria and loss of nucleus density.Glutathione andTiopronin showed a significant protective effect on the PTC exposed to Fe, Zn and Hg. However vitamin C and cysteine had no effect on cells treated with Hg. Conclusion: Iron, zinc and mercury showed toxic effect on kidney proxi? mal tubular cells, which include damage to plasma membrane, cytoplasm and/or the nucleus. 18.1 SATTERLIE, R.A.*, NOLEN, T.G., Ari? zona State University, SUNYNew Paltz.

McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="275">lation of swimming activity. Since the earliest behavioral investiga? tions of scyphomedusan and cubomedusan swimming, swim contractions were found to be controlled by multiple pacemaker/sen- sory centers that were spread around the margin of the jellyfish. Coordination of swim pacemakers was presumed to be due to a simple dominance hierarchy, in which a dis? charge in one pacemaker would reset all of the other pacemakers. The resultant pace? maker redundancy was examined in three previous modeling studies in which contrac? tile activity in a piece of jellyfish containing a single rhopalium was used to construct mod? els of multiple-pacemaker networks. In all three studies, pacemakers were connected to one another with re-setting linkages simi? lar to those described in earlier works. We conducted a similar study on the cubomedusa Carybdea marsupialis, but our initial results are not consistent with a model in which pacemakers interact via simple re? setting linkages, thus challenging the de- cades-old notion of how pacemakers inter? act in cubozoan and scyphozoan jellyfish. In our study, real electrophysiological data were compared to resetting and indepen? dent computer model networks of pacemak? ers. The real data fell between that of the two models suggesting that pacemakers show a degree of independence. Our mod? els also suggest that this type of semi-inde- pendent network may allow a greater sensi? tivity to asymmetrical stimuli, and thus allow significant directional reponses to these stimuli.

We are interested in how body plans are patterned and have focused on characteriz? ing homologues to the Drosophila gap gene Hunchback (hb) in two annelid classes. The hb gene encodes a C2H2 zinc-finger tran? scription factor that plays a pivotal role in fly pattern formation. We are using a cross-spe- cies antibody to compare the expression pat? terns of hunchback-like proteins in both leeches (Helobdella) and polychaetes (Capi? tella). Hb-like protein is expressed in the mi- cromeres (and its epithelial derivatives), the gut and the nervous system in both classes, and the class-specific differences in expres? sion correlate with changes in life history. Comparative studies between dipteran in? sects, nematode and annelid ftdexpression domains suggest there are at least two phases of shared hb function: an embryonic and organogenic phase. In the embryonic phase, hb is expressed in cells undergoing proliferation such as the epithelial cells that also undergo morphogenetic movements. In the organogenic phase, hb is expressed in differentiated neurons of the VNC and the peripheral nervous system. Together the hb expression patterns in annelids and nema- todes suggest that they do not participate in anteroposterior (AP) pattern formation in an analogous way to that of the hb in flies. This specific function apparently originated within the insect lineage. However the data does not preclude the possibility that hb homo? logues outside of insects adopted other pat? terning functions. This research is supported by NIH grant (HD-57778) to RMS.

The effects of chemical and mechani? cal stimulation on the discharge of desmonemes were quantitatively studied in situ, in ablated tentacles and in hypostome- attached tentacles of Hydra. Feeding and locomotion in hydra depend upon the dis? charge of nematocysts. Nematocysts are specialized organelles which possess a prominent trigger hair, the cnidocil. There are three types of nematocysts, the stenoteles, which pierce and paralyze prey, desmonemes, which ensnare them, and isorhizas, used for locomotion. Cnidocils of desmonemes were stimulated, 4 and 24 hours after tentacle ablation, with piezoelec- trically-driven probes vibrating at frequen? cies ranging between 2 and 80 Hz. The ef? fect of a nematocyst sensitizing agent, mu- cin, was studied at 6 and 60 Hz. Without mucin, desmonemes discharged in a fre- quency-dependent manner in 24 hour ab? lated tentacles, and in 4 and 24 hour ab- 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

The presence of the hypostome sig? nificantly depressed the response by over 30%. There was no frequency differentia? tion in 4 hour ablated tentacles. Desmoneme discharge was enhanced by the presence of mucin in a dose-dependent manner, with optimal discharge occuring at 1 X1011M and complete inhibition occurring at 1 X 105M. Mucin increased the number of desmonemes discharged at 60 Hz to equal the number discharged at 6 Hz without mu? cin. 6 Hz is the swimming frequency of labo? ratory prey. Striking the cnidocil with single contacts of increasingly greater force caused a significant increase in discharge in a dose- dependent manner. Our results suggest that the desmonemal cnidocil responds to the impulsive force of a mechanical stimulus whose threshold is lowered by the presence of mucin. 58.4 SCHAACK, S.*, CHAP-MAN, L.J., University of Florida, Gainesville. Cascad- ing effects of hypoxia on the functional mor? phology, ecology, and diversification of an African cyprinid. Adaptive change in one character may affect associated, but functionally unrelated, characters in an adaptive or non-adaptive way. For example, in some fish species, in? dividuals living in low oxygen environments have larger gills than conspecifics living in well-oxygenated water. Adaptive change in gill size may alter adjacent feeding struc? tures and therefore have indirect effects on behavior or other fitness components. This study investigates whether variation in gill size of the African cyprinid Barbus neumayeri correlates with variation in associated trophic structures, foraging ecology and fitness-re- lated characters in two populations living in different oxygen regimes. Our different popu? lations of B. neumayeri offer a unique sys? tem to examine functional-morphological tradeoffs. Reciprocal transplant cage experi? ments showed lower survivorship for small- gilled fish moved to hypoxic swamp waters. Large-gilled fish, however, do not show lower survivorship in stream cages, though they may suffer a competitive disadvantage if their large gills impact associated feeding struc- tures. To investigate this question, we com? pared trophic morphology and feeding effi? ciency of fish from small- and large-gilled populations. In addition, we evaluated dif? ferences in diet by quantifying prey abun? dance and selection for each group. Finally, we looked at fitness components in natural populations, including growth rates and con? dition factor. Our results demonstrate differ? ences in functional morphology, feeding ef? ficiency, diet, and some fitness components between the two populations. We argue that variation in gill size has facilitated the broad habitat distribution of B. neumayeri but may limit the success of phenotypes crossing physico-chemical gradients leading to diver? sification in this species.

Long necks in sauropods may have di? verse advantages. In addition to reaching up to browse on high vegetation, long necks permit sauropods to graze where they can? not easily stand, pass, or reach. Such re- strictive environments include the margins and bottoms of aquatic systems. We tested the forces required to extract limbs from mud to estimate the difficulties encountered by a large sauropod struggling to move through saturated soil. Sauropod leg models con? sisted of PVC pipes (1.6-11.4 cm diameter) with attached end caps. Additional weight was added inside the tubes as needed to adjust each leg to a standard weight of 2.5 kg. Thus the legs varied only in their dimen? sions. Legs were submerged into a tub con? taining saturated potting soil to a depth of 45 cm. A pulley system was used to determine the force required to vertically extract each limb in a standard period of time. The results indicate that drag force increases at nearly the same rate as the radius of the leg. In addition to requiring greater forces for limb extraction, muddy environments pose other challenges. Saturated soils often consist of a moving, unstable substrate. Extracting limbs from deep mud likely required a de? gree of agility and flexibility beyond that found in large sauropods.

Proposed growth-inhibitory role of a membrane-associated insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP) in an iguanid heart cell. A heart cell line derived from Iguana iguana expresses a single IGFBP that is present as both a secreted 30 kDa protein as well as bound on the cell membranes. Competition binding assays for the soluble iguana IGFBP demonstrate that the protein binds 125I-IGF-I in a highly specific manner, with 50% inhibition of 125I-IGF-I binding be? tween 0.1-0.5 ng/ml of added unlabeled IGF- I. Affinity crosslinking of 125I-IGF-I to cell mono- layers demonstrates that this IGFBP is also bound to the cell membranes at levels that rival that of the type-l IGF receptor. Addition of excess unlabeled IGF-I at concentrations above 10 ng/ml results in the removal of membrane-bound IGFBP, upon which a cor? responding increase in its levels in the me? dium are detected. This "membrane-re- moval" effect of IGF-I occurs rapidly, within 5 min of peptide addition. When the cells are precultured for 15 min in medium contain? ing 100 ng/ml IGF-I, followed by replacement of fresh identical medium (i.e., IGFBP is re? moved from membrane and the medium containing released IGFBP discarded), the mitogenic effect of IGF-I is significantly en? hanced as compared with cells in which the IGFBP remains throughout. This has pro- moted the hypothesis that this IGFBP serves to inhibit IGF-I actions in the iguana heart cell, using a unique mechanism by which IGF-I binding to abundant cell membrane- associated IGFBP is followed by release of the IGF/IGFBP complex from proximity to the cellular type-l IGF receptor.

The two dimensions of biodiversity research exemplified by Nematomorpha and Gastrotricha. Biodiversity research is characterized by two dimensions: the horizontal dimension recognizes species, their spatial interrela? tionships and patterns such as biogeo- graphical distribution. The vertical dimen? sion tries to explain the history of the recent biodiversity through phylogenetic and evo? lutionary approaches. The horizontal dimen? sion is illustrated by Nematomorpha (horse- hair worms). The standard of species de? scriptions has to be raised and reinvestiga- tions are necessary, if statements according species numbers, distribution patterns, im? pact on their host population and the role in the ecosystem should be substantial. The vertical dimension is illustrated by gastrot- richs. Recent hypotheses about their place? ment differ, either including them in the Spiralia (molecular data) or placing them basal to Cycloneuralia/Ecdysozoa (morpho? logical data). In both hypotheses, however, gastrotrichs are a very basal bilaterian taxon and therefore have a potentially solid im? pact on the phylogeny of this taxon as well as the reconstruction of it's ancestor. P1.3 SCHNEIDER, KS., University of Florida. The respiratory ecology of benthic macroinvertebrates in a swamp-river system in East Africa. Hypoxia (oxygen scarcity) is widespread in tropical freshwater systems, particularly in dense swamps, and may be an important factor structuring benthic macro-invertebrate communities. Benthic macro-invertebrates show a broad diversity of respiratory modes ranging from atmospherie breathers to tra? cheal gills. These adaptations have associ? ated costs and benefits that vary with eco? logical backgrounds and affect the ability of aquatic invertebrates to use hypoxic water. The objectives of this study were to (a) de? scribe the benthic macro-invertebrate com? munity from nine sites in Kibale National Park, Uganda and (b) determine the degree to which dissolved oxygen can explain varia? tion in respiratory guilds. There were distinct differences among sites in the occurrence of respiratory guilds and in their relative abundance. Across all sites, the percent rela? tive abundance of atmospherie breathers was negatively correlated with concentra? tion of dissolved oxygen, while the relative abundance of tracheal gill breathers was 800-955-1236 ?

Invertebrates with permanent or temporary air storage (transportable stores) were only found in high abundance in well-oxygen- ated flowing water. Seasonal differences in the relative abundance of respiratory guilds were most pronounced in the papyrus swamp site where dry season conditions produce extremely hypoxic waters (&lt;1.0 mg/ L). In the dry season the swamp was charac? terized by fewer respiratory guilds and a higher abundance of atmospheric breath- ers than during the wet season. Although other environmental characters may influ? ence the composition of benthic macro-in- vertebrates communities, dissolved oxygen concentration seems to be a good predictor of respiratory guild abundance and a key factor in maintaining invertebrate faunal structure and diversity. 4.1 SCHOENFUSS, HL*, BLOB, R.W., University of Minnesota, St. Paul, Field Mu? seum, Chicago. Kinematics of vertical climb? ing in hawaiian freshwater gobies. The Hawaiian freshwater ecosystem includes three species of waterfall climb? ing gobies. Larvae of these species are washed into the ocean by currents upon hatching, return to freshwater 3 to 6 months posthatching, and then climb waterfalls (up to 350 m vertically for Lentipes concolor) to reach adult habitats. We used high- speed video to contrast climbing kinemat? ics of Sicyopterus stimpsoni (20-24 mm total length) with that of Awaous guamensis and L. concolor (both 12-16 mm TL) on a clear plexiglas waterfall. L. concolor and A. guamensis climb vertically using bursts of axial-based swimming. Bursts typically last 0.07 ? 0.02 see at ve? locities of 10.3 ? 4.2 TLVsec (190 ? 80 mm/ see). The pectoral fins extend perpendicu- lar to the body during pauses between bursts, but adduct quickly as climbing re- sumes (possibly contributing to thrust ini? tiation). In contrast, S. stimpsoni usually climb by alternately attaching oral or pel? vic sucking discs to surfaces and 'inching' upwards with little axial undulation or fin movement. As the oral disc attaches it ex? pands to twice its resting area, after which the posterior body is pulled upwards; once the pelvic disc attaches, the oral disc re- leases and the anterior body advances. Climbing bouts can include multiple cycles of disc attachment and last several sec? onds at velocities of 0.25 1 0.04 TUsec (6 1 1 mm/sec). The use of power-bursts to climb may be impeded in S. stimpsoni as this species typically loses 15% of its weight during metamorphosis preceding their migration up waterfalls. By 'inching' up waterfalls, S. stimpsoni always remain attached to the substrate by suction at least at one point along the body. ONR N000149910184 (M.

Shared signals and the potential for phylo? genetic espionage between plants and ani? mals. Our understanding of responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli has developed sepa? rately for plants and animals. But recent bio? chemical and molecular work is producing a growing list of elements involved in diverse responses that are common to both king- doms. Some of the more interesting ex? amples of these are reviewed, including prostaglandin/octadecanoid-mediated re? sponses to wounding, oxidative defenses, steroid- and flavonoid-based signalling sys? tems, and pathogen-recognition mecha? nisms. Some of these similarities probably represent evolutionary convergence, while others may be ancestral to the development of plants and animals. Whatever the origins, they permit widely divergent taxa to exploit each other's signalling systems ("phyloge? netic espionage"). The ecological and evo? lutionary consequences, of such overlaps are highlighted. These include the existence of pathogens that can cause disease in plants and animals (e.g., strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa), the ability of herbivores to manipulate plant disease and anti-herbivore responses and enhance plant quality; the usurpation of microbial mecha? nisms and genes by parasitic insects, her? bivorous animals, and plants; the evolution of plant defenses that exploit signalling sys- 1202 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

Comparative study of the signalling and response mechanisms used by plants, animals, and microbes to deal with dynamic environments provides novel and useful insights to the ecology and evolution of interactions across kingdoms. Some of these insights suggest new ways in which we might exploit plants, animals, and microbes to our own benefit. 7.4 SCHWARTZ, M.L, NOR-ENBURG, J.L., George Washington University, Wash? ington, DC, Smithsonian Institution, Wash? ington, DC. Can we infer heteronemertean phylogeny from morphological data? A cladistic analysis of the genera within the order Heteronemertea (Nemertea) was performed from morphological data gath- ered from the literature. Resulting trees were numerous and mostly unresolved. The analysis gives insight into current taxonomic problems for the heteronemerteans. Chief among these are brief and inadequate taxo? nomic descriptions of species and morpho? logical features. The limited number of char? acters and poor definition of homologies available in this literature-based data set result in abundant homoplasy and hinder progress towards building a robust phylog? eny for the Heteronemertea. To remedy this, we are undertaking a critical re-examina- tion of taxa and characters by direct study of a range of heteronemertean exemplar spe? cies, for which we are gathering molecular sequence data to complement the morpho? logical data. We expect the resulting analy? ses to alter drastically the face of heteronemertean systematics. 29.4 SCHWARTZ, TS.*, KARL, S.A, Uni? versity of South Florida, Tampa. Genetic structure of florida gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) populations. Gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) population sizes are believed to have de? clined by an estimated 80% in the past 100 years. Habitat destruction from human de? velopment, predation, and infection from upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) have contributed to this decline. We currently are using 7-10 microsatellite loci to investigat- ing the genetic structure and phylogeography of 18 gopher tortoise popu? lations throughout Florida. Estimates of in? breeding and migration have been deter? mined for 5 of these populations. Effective population sizes (Ne) based on microsatellite data are being correlated with parallel field demographic studies. The occurrence of URTD will be compared to gene flow pat? terns among populations in an attempt to assess the potential association of migra? tion with the spread of the disease. Microsatellite data will be used to evaluate the phylogeography of the tortoise within Florida, and to identify potential effects of isolation in the populations peripheral to the Brooksville and Lake Wales ridges. This re? search will provide estimates on population viability and help focus conservation efforts on this threatened species. 8.1 SCHWENK, K, University of Con? necticut, Storrs. Extrinsic vs. Intrinsic lingual muscles: the amniote tongue as a functional unit. The muscular tongue of amniote verte? brates is traditionally described as a com? posite of two muscle types: extrinsic muscles originate outside the tongue and insert within it; intrinsic muscles arise and insert com? pletely within the tongue. Whole-tongue movements are attributed to the former, lin? gual shape change to the latter. This dichoto- mous view of tongue structure and function has endured since the mid-19th century, de? spite persistent indications of its inadequacy. A histological analysis of the mm. genioglo? ssus and verticalis in mammals and the m. hyoglossus in lepidosaurian reptiles finds: (1) the "extrinsic" m. genioglossus contrib? utes extensively to the "intrinsic" m. verticalis; (2) the verticalis "muscle" is composed of fibers from at least three nominally separate muscles, both extrinsic and intrinsic (genio? glossus, longitudinalis inferior, intrinsic verticalis fibers); (3) the "extrinsic" m. hyo? glossus in lepidosaurs comprises both ex? trinsic and intrinsic parts which may be his- tochemically differentiated.

The notion of indi- viduated "muscles" is inapplicable within the tongue and should be replaced by reference to "fiber systems." This view of the tongue highlights the weakness of an atomistic ap? proach to complex form and calls into ques? tion the application of traditional character concepts and character analyses to inte? grated functional units. 39.5 SCOTT, M.R, University of New Hamp? shire. Hormonally-mediated cues for mate recognition by burying beetles. Individual recognition of a mate or a past enemy has seldom been demonstrated in invertebrates. When recognition cues have been identified, they are usually found to be based on social status or family member? ship. Burying beetles rear a brood on an un- predictable resource and as a pair, they must defend their young and the resource from conspecific intruders.Thus a mechanism for the identification of a non-mate is necessary for the appropriate aggressive response. Burying beetles appear to match the hor? monal state of an intruder to a template based on that of their mate. Unknown indi? viduals at the same reproductive stage were accepted as mates. In addition, aggression by males was significantly reduced towards unknown non-breeding females treated with juvenile hormone or its analogue, methoprene. When mating behavior was ex? amined, the "acceptance threshold" for the comparison of the unknown individual to the template was lower than for aggressive be? havior. Males were more likely to mate or attempt to mate with non-breeding, breed? ing, or treated strangers than with their own mate, as long as trial with the mate preceded the trial with the stranger. Aggression toward unknown non-breeding females treated with an extract of the mate's cuticular hydrocar- bons was reduced. Thus we conclude that recognition cues are provided by contact pheromones. P1.83SCRUGGS, J.R.*, GLAS, P.S., The Citadel, Charleston, SC Protein changes in the embryonic coat during development of the grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio. The morphological changes in the em? bryonic coats of grass shrimp were shown by Glas, et al. (1997), but the composition of the embryonic coat has yet to be determined. This study determined that the embryonic coat protein composition of the developing grass shrimp changes over time as the em? bryo adds new internal envelopes. Embryos were collected during each stage of their embryonic development, and the embryonic coats were isolated. The isolates were then electrophoresed, fixed and stained for pro? tein. Additionally, embryos were cultured in cell culture dishes, and the supernatant was removed and concentrated. The concentrate was then electrophoresed on a gradient gel, fixed and stained. The results of these ex? periments show a change in the position of the protein bands suggesting that the em? bryonic coat protein content changes as en? velopes are added and then dissolved dur? ing embryonic development. There was no definitive evidence of an ovoperoxidase enzyme as found in other invertebrates. This study begins the determination of the com? position of the different envelopes. This de? termination will be of assistance in culture of similar species that are used as food sources. Embryonic coat composition may also be of use in environmental monitoring.

Postprandial response of plasma lipids and the hormone leptin in pythons. With each meal, pythons rapidly upregulate gut performance and dramatically increase metabolic rate. We suggest one manner by which pythons fuel these post? prandial responses is to mobilize stored energy sources, particularly lipids. To evalu? ate the mobilization of lipids with feeding we measured plasma levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol from fasted and fed pythons. Aware that the hormone leptin possibly mediates fat deposition and me? tabolism, we simultaneously measured plasma levels of leptin from fasted and fed snakes. Following the ingestion of meals equaling 25% of their body mass, pythons significantly increased plasma levels of trig? lycerides (by 50-fold), free fatty acids (by 50%), and cholesterol (by 80%). Simulta? neously, pythons experienced significant increases (by 65%) in plasma concentra? tions of leptin. Fasted control snakes (sampled at the same time and in the same fashion as fed snakes) exhibited no signifi? cant changes in plasma lipid or leptin con? centrations. Feeding induces in pythons the mobilization of lipids which conceivably serve as the energy source to fuel the costly upregulation of their guts after feeding. Leptin may function to trigger the release of these lipids from fat bodies and to stimulate the postprandial increase in metabolism.

Economic and ecological problems as? sociated with aquatic non-indigenous spe? cies (NIS) are growing nationally and inter- nationally. Many of these species introduc- tions are preventable, and are caused by vectors that an informed public can do some? thing about directly (live bait, aquaculture, and pet industries) or indirectly (by support? ing policy limiting ballast water dispersal of coastal organisms). In order to reach the broadest possible audience with accurate, up-to-date information on the biology, pre? vention, and control of marine NIS, the Uni? versity of Washington-Tacoma (UWT) and the Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium (PDZA) in Tacoma, WA are jointly designing a public exhibit on NIS for aquaria through? out the Pacific Northwest.

The avian suborbital air sac and its potential role in brain cooling in birds and other dinosaurs. The avian suborbital air sac, a caudal diverticulum of the antorbital paranasal air sinus, partially encircles the eyeball and in- terleaves between portions of the jaw mus? culature. It is unique in being a paranasal sinus capable of being actively ventilated like a bellows pump during abduction and adduction of the mandible. The discovery of a dense venous plexus surrounding the sub? orbital air sinus suggests a physiological role as an important contributor to selective brain cooling via its drainage into the ophthalmic rete, an arteriovenous countercurrent heat exchanger known to cool the hypothalamus. In addition, the suborbital plexus is poten? tially involved in whole-brain cooling via multiple routes of drainage, including: (1) the ethmoid vein and thus the dorsal sagittal si? nus; (2) drainage through foramina for CN II- VI into the cavernous sinus which surrounds the hypophysis; and (3) along the maxillomandibular (trigeminal) nerve via drainage of the ophthalmic rete, into the ros? tral petrosal sinus which is in close contact with the mesencephalon. These findings may shed light on dinosaur physiology in that several non-avian theropod dinosaurs pos? sess osteological correlates for the subor? bital air sinus; moreover, many fossil archosaurs display the bony architecture permitting the presence of a suborbital di? verticulum of the antorbital air sinus. The very large size of the cranial nerve foramina in certain dinosaurs may provide further evi? dence of the brain-cooling properties of the suborbital air sac and/or other orbital vascu? lar structures.

Field biology laboratories are intended to provide students with experience at con- ducting experiments under field conditions. However, actual conditions at the scheluled time of the class may not be suitable or de- sirable for field experiments. Therefore, labo? ratory exercises are needed that allow ex? periments to be conducted under simulated field conditions. A terrestrial field biology course is offered at Duquesne University in the Spring semester. The first two months of this class correspond with winter weather in Pittsburgh and therefore are not always ame- nable to field experiments. I employ a series of experiments which can be readily substi- tuted for a field excursion if the weather is not suitable. These include: mark-recapture of flour beetles, migration (emigration/immi- gration) of sow bugs, and density and diver? sity of plants determined from line intersect and quadrat studies of artificial aerial maps. These substitute experiments have allowed us to learn the methods and principles of field ecology even under the most harsh con? ditions. 13.3 SELCER, K.W.*, DAY, A.M., VERBANIC, J.D, Duquesne University. Northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) vitellogenin: purification, development of an immunoassay, and characterization of in? duction following immersion in diethylstil? bestrol. In oviparous vertebrates, estrogen stimu? lates the female liver to produce the egg yolk precursor, vitellogenin.This protein circulates in the blood, is taken up by oocytes, and is cleaved into egg-yolk proteins. Vitellogenin is now being used as a biomarker for expo? sure of animals to environmental estrogens. Thus, there is a need for assays capable of measuring vitellogenin induction in various species. The purpose of this study was to characterize vitellogenin induction in adult male Rana pipiens after injection with estra- diol-17BETA and after immersion in the po? tent estrogenic compound diethylstilbestrol (DES). Sera from estrogen-treated frogs had significantly elevated total protein levels, compared to control frogs. Denaturing gel electrophoresis revealed increased amounts of a large (160 kDa) protein, pre? sumably vitellogenin. The identity of the pu? tative vitellogenin was confirmed by its cross-reactivity in Western blots with an an? tibody generated against a Xenopus laevis 1206 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

An anti-f?ana pipiens vitellogenin antibody was also generated from the purified vitellogenin. An enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay was developed for Rana pipiens vitellogenin and the assay was used to characterize vitellogenin induc? tion in frogs immersed in DES for various times and at different doses. Elevations in serum and hepatic cytosol vitellogenin were detected within five days after initial immer? sion in 1 mg/L DES and vitellogenin levels continued to increase through 20 days. In? duction of vitellogenin in Rana pipiens may be a useful model system for field studies of environmental estrogens. S1.7 SHADLEY, JR. *, HILL, PSM, Univer? sity of Tulsa, OK. Talking back: sending soil vibration signals to lekking prairie mole cricket males. The prairie mole cricket, Gryllotalpa ma? jor, native of the tallgrass prairie of the south central U.S., is the largest North American cricket. A male constructs a specialized acoustic burrow in the spring in the prairie soil from which he generates an airborne calling song that attracts flying females for mating. At the same time, vibrations with the same temporal scale and pattern as the air? borne signal are produced in the substrate through an unknown mechanism. These ground vibrations can be distinguished from background vibrations in the soil with a geo- phone (transducer) buried in the soil at dis? tances up to 3 m, depending on soil condi? tions and conditions that control the back? ground vibration environment (e.g. wind, highway traffic). We hypothesize that males use the vibration component of the call as information for spacing as they form display arenas, or leks. We used modified field re? cordings of soil vibrations from singing males with an electromechanical vibration exciter to simulate the vibration component of a sing? ing male in playback experiments. Airborne sounds of males were monitored for two min? utes before and two minutes after the intro? duction of the ground vibration signal with a tape recorder microphone placed 20 cm from the burrow opening. Males did respond to the manipulation experiment; although, we observed individual variation in the level of response.

Me? chanical power production by red and white swimming muscles of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). The mechanical performance of red and white muscle from yellowfin tuna was stud? ied in vitro at 25?C using the work loop tech? nique. Fibers from internal red muscle were taken from two axial locations, 0.5L and 0.65L (L=total body length), and subjected to sinusoidal strains at frequencies of 1 -12Hz and activation patterns that mimicked those in vivo, as determined previously. White fi? bers from 0.45L and 0.65L were tested over frequencies of 3-15Hz. During steady swim? ming, where the muscle strain cycle (=tail beat) frequency is 2-4Hz, the activation phase and duration used by fish were nearly identical to those that elicited maximal net work and power from isolated red muscle. The greatest net work per cycle occurred at 1-2Hz, while peak power (=work X fre? quency) was obtained at 3-4Hz. Thus, dur? ing steady swimming the internal red muscle functions to maximize power production. At higher frequencies, the stimulation phase and duration that yielded maximal net work decreased, as expected, with power drop- ping to zero at about 9Hz. The twitch time (i.e from stimulus to peak force) of red fibers was about 100ms. Compared to skipjack tuna, yellowfin red muscle has slower con? traction kinetics, so it requires longer and earlier activation to maximize power output. These results are in agreement with the dif? ferences in muscle activation timing previ? ously reported for these two species in vivo. For yellowfin white fibers, tests with optimal activation produced the greatest work per cycle at 8Hz and peak power at 10Hz. Posi? tive net work was still produced at frequen? cies up to 14Hz, approximately the highest tail beat frequency recorded during burst swimming. 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

The cost and effi? ciency of aerobic locomotion in the chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus). The cost of aerobic locomotion in the chub mackerel was investigated at different steady swimming speeds in a water tunnel respirometer. Eight fish, 25 to 30 cm in length (L), and 145-199g mass were used at 14- 15?C. 02 consumption was measured by computer-controlled intermittent flow respirometry with a ten minute cycle. Fish were placed in the respirometer and allowed to acclimatize while swimming at a low speed (1 L/s) for at least 12 h while 02 con? sumption was monitored. Initially high val? ues typically declined by 3 to 5-fold to a stable level after several hours of undisturbed swim? ming. Swim speeds were then raised in in- crements of 0.25L/S each 30 min until steady swimming was no longer possible, usually near 3L/s. A the same time, dorsal body im? ages were recorded by video at 60Hz. 02 consumption increased exponentially with speed. Extrapolation of In-linear plots to zero velocity gave estimates of standard meta? bolic rates (SMR), ranging from 90-120 mg O/kg/h, or 0.35-0.47 Watts/kg. The aerobic scope was in excess of 6.8 times the SMR. The cost of transport was minimal (2.0-3.5 J/ kg/m) at 1.5-1.75 L/s. Kinematic analysis of the dorsal body midline, using the Lighthill small amplitude bulk momentum model, provided an estimate of the thrust power and kinetic energy losses. By comparing the si? multaneously determined power output and metabolic power consumed, the froude and aerobic efficiencies were calculated. These were typically &gt;0.8 and &lt;0.2, respectively.

Developmental and envi? ronmental expression of the gene for a Na/ K/2CI cotransporter in the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus). Juvenile blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) inhabit low salinity environments (5 ppt or less) in the tidal rivers and creeks of south- eastern NC. Larvae generally hatch from ovigerous females in sea water (about 35 ppt). It is possible that an ontogenetic change in the capacity to osmoregulate dictates the developmental stage at which recruitment to estuaries occurs. Reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to examine the expression of genes potentially coding for parts of the os? moregulatory mechanism. A V-type proton pump is expressed at all embryonic and lar? val stages examined. It is also expressed at high levels in both the anterior (gas ex? change) and posterior (ion transporting) gills of adult blue crabs. Expression of the V-AT? Pase is equally high in the hepatopancreas. For these reasons, this gene does not ap? pear to be specifically induced as a require? ment for osmoregulation. On the other hand, the mRNA for a Na/K/2CI cotransporter shows interesting tissue-related, stage-re- lated, and salinity-related expression. It is present in both gill types but is much more strongly expressed in the posterior gills. It is absent in the hepatopancreas. The cotransporter mRNA is present at high lev? els in all embryonic stages from gastrula to hatching. However, the gene is not ex? pressed in megalopae at 35 ppt salinity. At this stage it is induced by gradually decreas? ing the salinity to 5 ppt. This suggests that the cotranspor-ter is part of the osmoregula? tory mechanism and that it can be activated as needed. Zoea stages are being cultured to determine when the cotransporter prod? uct is no longer constitutively present (as in embryos) and when it becomes inducible by hyposaline conditions (as in megalopae). 47.5 SHAPIRO, M.D, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.

Morphology and de? velopment of the postcranial axial skeleton of the American shad, Alosa sapidissima. The morphology and ontogeny of the postcranial skeleton were studied in three developmental series and a number of postmeta-morphic specimens of American shad, equaling more than 180 specimens. Specimens were cleared and stained with alcian blue to identify cartilage structures and with alizarin red to examine bone develop? ment. Histological preparations were made to confirm several questionable cases of endochondrial ossification. Pre-hatch em? bryos lack postcranial skeletal elements al? though the finfolds and pectoral fin buds are present. By the end of the yolk-sac larval period the hypurals in the caudal fin begin to form, rapidly followed by the development of the dorsal and anal fins. As the medial fins form, the elements of the vertebral col? umn develop. The paired pelvic fins are the last to form during the metamorphic change of larvae into juveniles. The developmental sequence was divided into a series of stages that will allow future comparisons with other closely related species. Our results also show that 1) the uroneurals in shad are endochondrial in origin like other teleosts, 2) hypural 1 is autogenous because of in? complete ossification, 3) mineralization of protocentra occurs in an anterior to poste? rior direction resulting in chordacentra, and 4) development of the skull and anterior ver? tebral column exhibit several modifications associated with the otophysic system and sound transmission. P2.96 SHEETS, D.H.*, ZELDITCH, M.L, Canisius College, University of Michigan. Studies of shapes with bilateral symmetry. The first step in any comparison of shapes is putting them in a common frame? work or registration, which is done by super? imposition. Superimposition involves plac- ing shapes on top of each other, mathemati- cally rescaling them, and sometimes rotat- ing them so that they differ as little as pos? sible from each other. This allows for math? ematical comparison of shape, eliminating differences in size or position of the object. The most common methods of superposi- tion are based on minimizing the morpho? metric difference between two shapes. We show how these approaches can produce biologically unreasonable superpositions when organisms are bilaterally symmetric. The problem is that the methods do not re? spect that axis of symmetry. We suggest an alternative approach to superimposition that does respect axes of symmetry. This alter? native is likely to be most useful in cases of bilateral symmetry, but may also be useful whenever workers wish to prevent biologi? cally implausible rotations of shapes. Soft? ware developed for several superposition methods will be shown and made available. 31.2 SHEIL, C.S., University of Kansas, Lawrence. Amniote phylogeny inferred from morphology. Phylogenetic relationships among living and fossil amniotes remain uncertain, and the topic is among the most contentious in evolutionary biology. Numerous evolution? ary hypotheses supported by molecular and morphological data have been published re? cently. Previously, I presented results of a collaboration that combined the largest set of morphological and molecular data. Here, preliminary results of an expanded morpho? logical data set (i.e., incresed taxon and char? acter sampling) are presented.

Flow speed influences the spatial and temporal distribution of a chemical signal. However, a boundary layer exists around the olfactory appendages and can further influence the distribution of chemical signal. The goal of this research is to quantify how morphology and fluid flow interact to influ? ence the movement of a chemical signal along an organismis body. This research is critical for understanding the interaction be? tween hydrodynamics and sensory biology. Brown bullheads have taste buds along their body that are used to sense chemicals that mediate a variety of behaviors. The chemi? cal signal was measured using the IVEC 10 along the body of a model brown bullhead. Several parameters, including peak length, peak rise time, maximum height, absolute slope, and maximum slope were analyzed as well as a spectral analysis. Differences in signal parameters were found along the body and at different flows. These results show that the presence of the model, flow and position on the fish model affects the chemical signal properties and thus influ? ences the type of information the bullhead can perceive. There is an interaction occur? ring between flow, the presence of model and specific areas on the fish. This indicates that the morphology of the body affects sig? nals attributes and acts as a sensory filter.

Similarities and differences in fine gill vas? culature among batiod elasmobranchs. Classic studies of gill vasculature indi? cate the gross anatomy of elasmobranch gills is similar in most species, and in gen? eral, resembles that of teleosts. Recent studies of fine gill structure of several spe? cies of batoid elasmobranchs (Order: Rajiformes), however, have reported pre? viously undescribed fine structural differ? ences including; the presence, in Urolophus jamaicensis, U. mucosus, U. paucimaculatus, Rhinoptera bonasus, Dasyatis americana and D. sabina (Sub? order: Myliobatoidei), of; 1) a tip channel, possibly an extension of the afferent fila? ment artery that runs along the distal end of the filament corpus cavernosum; and 2) a vascular arcade, a vessel serially con? necting afferent filament arteries of indi? vidual hemibranchs near the tip of the gill filaments. Using light and scanning elec? tron microscopy we examined the fine gill structure of Raja erinacea, R. ocellata and R. radiata (Suborder: Rajoidei). Contrary to previous reports which suggested that these structures might be unique to Myliobatids, results of this study indicate the presence of a similar vascular arcade and tip channel in Rajoidei. However, dif? ferences were found in the gross structure of the ventral aorta and afferent branchial arteries between the suborders. Additional research is necessary to further elucidate the adaptive significance, if any, of these morphological differences between closely related groups of Rajiform fishes. 25.3 SHERRARD, KM, University of Chi? cago.

In the solitary spe? cies Corella inflata, individuals increase greatly in size, from a siphonal Reynolds number of 102 to 102. In the colonial species Distaplia occidentalis, the first zooid doubles in length during the first two weeks, after which additional zooids begin to appear. High resolution, in vivo particle tracking ex? periments using early juvniles of these two species suggest that the high cost of resis? tance to flow in a small siphon is balanced by its greater ability to draw in particles. S14.1 SHI, YB.;NICHD. Mechanism and de? velopmental function of gene regulation by thyroid hormone receptors in Xenopus laevis. Thyroid hormone (T3) receptors (TRs) are the presumed mediators of the effects of T3 during metamorphosis. Interestingly, these receptors are expressed not only dur? ing metamorphosis but also in premetamor- phic tadpoles when there is noT3. To inves? tigate the roles of TRs during Xenopus laevis development, we have taken several ap? proaches. First, using an oocyte transcrip? tion system, we have demonstrated thatTR/ RXR hetero-dimers can alternatively activate or repress aT3-dependent promoter in chro? matin in the presence or absence of T3, re? spectively. Furthermore, transcriptional regu? lation by TR/RXR appears to involve histone acetylases/deacetylases and transcriptional activation is accompanied by drastic chro? matin disruption. Second, we have analyzed the expression of TR and RXR (9-cis retinoic acid receptor, the hetero-dimerization part? ner of TR) genes during development, which suggests that TR/RXR heterodimers have dual roles during frog development. Third, by introducing TRs and/or RXRs into Xeno? pus embryos, We have shown that TR/RXR heterodimers, but not TRs or RXRs alone, can precociously activate endogenous genes in the presence of T3, while repress- ing these genes in the absence of T3. Finally, we demonstrate by chromatin immu- noprecipitation (ChIP) assay that TR/RXR heterodimers are bound to T3 target genes in premetamorphic tadpoles. We further show that histone acetylation changes cor? relate with T3 target gene expression in some but not all tadpole organs. These results suggest that TR/RXR heterodimers have dual functions during frog development, in part by modifying histone acetylation. 11.6 SHILLINGTON, C, Oklahoma State University. Energy metabolism and thermal ecology of male tarantulas (Araneae: Theraphosidaej. Male tarantulas of North America engage in intense mate-searching activity during the mating season. They compete for opportu- nities to mate and their mating success de? pends largely on rapid walking. Because they are ectotherms, their biological pro? cesses are dependent on environmental temperatures, which influences body tem? perature (Tb). Tb, in turn, has pronounced effects on metabolic rates and activities like locomotion and may directly influence mat? ing opportunities. Temperature and ener? getic considerations are of particular inter? est because these factors help define the behavioral capabilities of animals and influ? ence and organism's interactions with its bi? otic and abiotic environment. Field studies of active male tarantulas indicate that they are primarily thermoconform-ers and restrict activity periods to times when ambient and ground temperatures are within their pre? ferred range of body temperatures. Because of exceedingly hot day-time temperatures, males retreat below ground into abandoned burrows or holes during daylight hours and emerge around sunset. Times of retreat and emergence are temperature dependent al? though light intensity is also an important factor. Resting metabolic rates measured in both male and female tarantulas increased with temperature and, after adjusting for body mass, males had significantly higher meta? bolic rates than females between 20 and 35 degrees Celsius.

The integument may bear many unique structures, including scaiids, flosculi, setae, hooks, trunk scaiids, tubercles and tumuli. A spacious body cavity serves as a hydrostatic skeleton and contains a complex alimentary canal with a thick, muscular phar? ynx. Several blood cell types occur. Unusual protonephridia serve as excretory organs. Priapulids are dioecious, with internal or external fertilization; hermaphroditism and parthenogenesis may occur. Indirect devel? opment of demersal larvae is normal, but direct development occurs in one species. Morphology of larvae is less variable than in adults and three types of larvae are known. Distribution of 18 extant species is from the shallow arctic, to the deep ocean, to intersti? tial waters of tropical, sandy beaches. Sizes vary from meiofaunal (&lt;0.5 mm) to macrofaunal (40 cm). Some extant species are morphologically similar to mid-Cambrian fossils. The feeding ecology of most species is unknown, but several macrofaunal priapulids are predaceous and help struc? ture benthic communities; some are com? mon prey items for marine mammals and fish. Some species have high tolerance of hypoxic conditions and hydrogen sulfide. Priapulida have close affinities with Kinorhyncha, Loricifera and perhaps Nematomorpha.

The preservation of repro? ductive behaviors during chilling by a rapid cold-hardening process in Drosophila melanogaster. Rapid cold-hardening, which occurs within minutes or hours, confers protection from injury during sudden chilling. Recently, we demonstrated that rapid cold-hardening occurs during ecologically-based fhermoperiods and functions to decrease the temperature at which flies enter cold torpor. However, the evolutionary significance of this process, as it relates to reproduction, has been little studied. In this study, we demon? strated that rapid cold-hardening preserves normal reproductive behaviors in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Once group of flies was rapidly cold-hardened by step transfer of the flies from 23?C to 16?C. We video taped pairs of rapidly cold hardened (RCH) flies (exposed to 16?C for 2 h) and pairs of control flies (transferred directly from 23?C) at 16?C, and measured whether they courted, the duration of courtship, and whether they mated. More RCH pairs than control pairs were able to court (17 vs. 11 pairs) and to mate (11 vs. 0 pairs). The court? ship events of the RCH flies averaged 19.013.5 min, which was significantly longer than that of control pairs (9.512.2 min). We also repeated these tests at 23/C and found no significant difference between RCH and control groups in the number of pairs court? ing or mating. However, the event durations of the control flies (7.911.2 min) were signifi? cantly longer than those of the RCH pairs (4.910.7 min). S10.12 SIMMS, ?, BEVER, J.

Effects of le- gume symbiosis on rhizobium evolution Symbiosis between legumes and nitro- gen-fixing bacteria is thought to bring mu- tual benefit to each participant. However, it is unclear how rhizobia benefit from nodula- tion of legume hosts because they fix nitro? gen only after differentiating into bacteroids, terminally differentiated cells that cannot re? produce. Because free-living rhizobia can reproduce, and may benefit from the in? crease of plant root exudates stimulated by nodulation. Hence, evolution of symbiotic nitrogen fixation may depend upon kin se? lection. Spatial genetic structure often im? poses constraints on the evolution of kin selected traits because it can influence their vulnerability to cheating. We have been us? ing simple mathematical models to investi? gate the effect of spatial structure of rhizo? bium populations within the soil on the evo? lution of symbiotic traits. Our models predict that nitrogen fixation can evolve as a symbi? otic trait under relatively strict conditions of spatial structure. However, other traits, such as the ability to produce and use private car? bon sources, may expand the conditions under which nitrogen fixation can evolve. We present these and other models that explore the effect of legume symbiosis on evolution in this interesting group of bacteria. 1212 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Seasonal pattern of plasma steroid levels and ovarian growth in the adult female slider turtle, Trachemys scripta scripta. The female seasonal reproductive cycle was studied in a captive South Carolina population of slider turtles (Trachemys scripta scripta) over a period of one year. Plasma concentrations of estradiol-17BETA, proges? terone and testosterone were measured during the cycle using radioimmunoassay. Ovaries were removed from randomly se? lected individuals throughout the year to monitor ovarian growth. While mean ova? rian mass increased from mid-summer through the following spring, the increase was not statistically significant. Mean plasma levels of all three hormones were relatively low throughout the year when compared to other freshwater turtle species. Estradiol lev? els were Iowest, followed by testosterone and progesterone levels respectively. Cir? culating estradiol and testosterone levels exhibited no apparent pattern over the re? productive cycle. However progesterone concentrations, although relatively low and static during most of the year, displayed a distinct peak, possibly representing a spike, around ovulation. The periovulatory release of high levels of progesterone along with the short life of corpora lutea in these turtles, suggests that preovulatory follicles, rather than corpora lutea, may be the primary source of progesterone in slider turtles.

Branchial carbonic anhydrase (CA) in euryhaline crustaceans is known to function in active ion uptake and osmoregulation in low salinity. This function could be compro- mised by heavy metals in the aquatic envi? ronment. Cytoplasmic CA from gills of Callinectes sapidus and Carcinus maenas was titrated against increasing concentra? tions of Ag, Cu, Cd, and Zn in vitro to deter? mine the inhibitory effects on the enzyme. All metals were strong inhibitors of CA from C. sapidus, with Ki values of 0.39,0.40,0.65 and 3.88 nM, respectively. Concentrations needed to affect 100% inhibition were also low: 3.3,17,17, and 166 nM, for Ag, Cu, Cd, and Zn, respectively. In contrast, cytoplas? mic CA from gills of C. maenas was much less sensitive to heavy metal inhibition. Con? centrations of Cu, Cd, and Zn needed to achieve 100% inhibition in vitro were 4.2, 5.0, and 12.5 M, respectively, approximately 100 to 1000 fold higher than those for C sapidus. This suggests the presence of a metal-resistant isoform in the gills of C. maenas that may help protect the ion trans? port mechanism against heavy metal toxic? ity. When individuals of C. maenas accli? mated to 35 ppt salinity and exposed to three concentrations of Cd (0.1, 1.0, and 10 M) were transferred to low salinity (10 ppt), mor? tality was no different than in control, un? treated crabs. Furthermore, hemolymph osmotic concentrations in both control and treated crabs stabilized by 12 hr post-trans- fer at between 650 and 700 mOsm.

Three-di? mensional kinematics of level flight in the Egyptian fruit bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus. To understand the functional and evolu? tionary significance of the diversity of bat wing morphologies, it is critical to understand the three-dimensional deployment of the wing during flight behaviors.

We trained four individuals to fly in a wind-tunnel over a range of veloci? ties. We then employed a dual camera sys? tem to record digital video images of flights.

Further investigations into the interactions between small vertebrates and oaks: an in? terdisciplinary approach. At last year's meeting, we reported that several species of small vertebrates consis- tently cache viable acorns of the red oak group much more frequently than those of the white oak group. We hypothesized that this behavior affects the structure of forests. Seedlings from red oak species should be widely dispersed from their parent trees, while those from white oaks should be clumped near the parent tree. We have now begun a long term project, utilizing molecu? lar genetic techniques (DNA fingerprinting) to test this hypothesis directly. Here, we present an interim report on this project. We have mapped study sites in two locations, with some species in common between the sites. We have sampled over 500 adult and seedling oak trees at each site. For one site, we have isolated usable DNA from most in? dividuals. We are now using these DNA samples to test primer pairs shown to am? plify polymorphic simple tandem repeats (STRs) in other oak species, and to optimize PCR conditions for each primer set. We have identified 9 primer pairs which reliably am? plify STRs with multiple alleles (determined by sizing on agarose and acrylamide gels) in Quercus alba, Q. velutina and Q. rubra. The variation at these 9 sites should allow us to assemble unique profiles for each in? dividual. We are now matching the DNA profiles of seedlings and adult trees to iden? tify parent-offspring pairs. This allows us to directly test our hypothesis, by measuring dispersal distances between adult trees and their offspring. As far as we know, this repre- sents the first use of molecular genetic tech? niques to test specific seed dispersal hypoth? eses.

Hox genes are transcription factors that control regional specification of tissues in developing embryos. Our laboratory is work? ing toward the complete characterization of the Hox cluster genes from Morone saxitilis, a member of the order Perciformes. A ge? nomic clone, 11D, was isolated and found to contain a complete paralogous group 1 gene (11D-1). Phylogenetic analysis shows that 11 D-1 is most related to Oryzias latipes and Danio rerio Hox-b1b. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of Morone embryos with an 11 D-1 exonl-specific antisense riboprobe shows an expression pattern dif? ferent from the patterns described for Hox- a1a and b1a genes in Danio rerio. These genes in Danio rerio are expressed prima? rily in the notochord and rhombomeres. 11D- 1 is initially expressed in the cell cap during gastrulation, and in the notochord and paraxial mesoderm during neurulation. This early expression fades and by the 14-somite stage, 11 D-1 is later expressed dorso-ven- trally and in the hindbrain before all expres? sion terminates by 72 hpf (corresponding to the pec fin stage in Danio rerio). The three phase expression, primarily outside of the hindbrain, and the duration of expression are unusual for a paralogous group 1 gene, and suggests that 11 D-1 is a gene not previ? ously characterized in teleosts. However, our data indicates that 11 D-1 is a member of paralogous group 1 and is most likely a B or D cluster derivative. Additional linkage data will be required to assign 11 D-1 to a specific Hox cluster. P2.36SMITH, T.L*, KARDONG, K.V., Wash? ington State University, Pullman.

McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="291">integument and feces have been shown to produce behaviors correlated with increased predatory behavior. In addition, recent stud? ies have shown that blood, itself, provides similar cues in some groups of snakes. It has been proposed that blood acquired dur? ing a predatory strike in rattlesnakes might elicit elevated levels of tongue-flicking. Rattlesnakes typically release rodents im? mediately poststrike, and exhibit a high rate of tongue flicking along with increased move? ment. Collectively these behaviors have been defined as strike-induced chemosen? sory searching (SICS). The strike releases SICS, and it releases specific poststrike trail? ing of the envenomated rodent. The exact cue (or cues) used during poststrike trailing is unknown, but integumentary cues (mouse odor) are likely used to locate and follow the trail of the envenomated rodent. Because blood has been shown to elicit SICS, we asked if blood might also serve as a chemosensory cue guiding post-strike trail? ing as well. In other words, can rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis oreganus) use blood, alone, as a prey odor trail during poststrike trail? ing? Fifteen snakes were run in a series of Y-maze choice trials, presenting them with blood from the mouse they just envenomated versus a control trail. We found that although the group of snakes showed an elevated rate of tongue-flicking, poststrike, they failed to follow a blood trail alone. Therefore, al? though blood seems to elicit SICS, it is not a chemosensory cue used directly in poststrike trailing. 6.4 SMITH, W.L, WEBB, J.F.*, Villanova University. Phylogenetic variation in the mor? phology of the laterophysic connection in butterfly-fishes of the genus Chaetodon. The laterophysic connection is a unique linkage between paired anterior diverticula (horns) of the swimbladder and mesial open? ings in the cranial lateral-line canals in the supracleithra, which may allow the lateral- line system of butterfly-fishes in the genus Chaetodon to detect pressure stimuli. A his? tological examination of 19 species in 10 of the 12 Chaetodon subgenera has revealed two laterophysic connection types (direct and indirect) and six laterophysic connec- tion variants on these two types. A direct laterophysic connection (where swimbladder horns lie deep to the lateral- line canal in the supra-cleithrum with only or without intervening mucoid connective tis? sue) was found in 9 species in 6 subgenera. Two variants on the direct laterophysic con? nection differed in the presence or absence of the mucoid connective tissue and in swimbladder morphology. An indirect laterophysic connection (where epaxial muscle lies between the lateral-line canal in the supra-cleithrum and the swimbladder horns) was found in 10 species in 5 subgen? era. Four variants on the indirect laterophysic connection also differed in the presence or absence of mucoid connective tissue and in swimbladder morphology. We hypothesize that the variation in soft tissue morphology that defines the laterophysic connection types and variants is functionally significant. In addition, we used four characters derived from this study to hypothesize new subgeneric relationships for Chaetodon and to examine the phylogenetic distribution of these laterophysic connection characters among species in the genus.

Alterations in stress proteins correlate with space competition in sessile marine invertebrates. Competition for space among sessile marine invertebrates, following larval settle? ment, can involve aggressive behaviors and the production of biologically active sub? stances. These strategies have been widely studied in benthic cnidarians, for which the destructive nature of such responses to com? peting species is well known. In this work, we have chosen two nearshore subtidal cnidarians, the anemone Anthopleura elegantissima and the corallimorpharian Corynactis californica. We tested whether stress proteins (HSP70) could be useful in? dicators of intra- and interspecies competi? tion intensity in these species.

Molecular ge? netic perspectives on the coevolution of avian brood parasites and their hosts. Some of the clearest examples of coevo? lution are provided by avian brood parasites and their hosts. Adaptations of parasitic spe? cies to secure parental care from hosts and counter-adaptations of hosts to avoid or re? duce the negative effects of parasitism have been studied extensively in selected spe? cies. Recently, molecular genetic data have added a historical perspective to analyses of host-parasite coevolution. We review re? cent molecular studies on cowbirds, cuck- oos, and parasitic finches, focussing on the role of varying behavioral mechanisms in the evolution of host-specificity. The African indigobirds (Vidua spp.) are the most host- specific of brood parasites. Each indigobird species generally mimics the songs and nestling mouth markings of a single host species. Behavioral studies have demon? strated that indigobirds imprint on the songs of their hosts and that indigobirds reared by a particular host species mate assortatively. Broad sharing of mitochondrial haplotypes and microsatellite alleles among indigobird species indicates a very recent and rapid diversification, precipitated by indigobirds colonizing and imprinting on new hosts. Common cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) are known for their species-specific mimicry of host egg markings. In contrast to indigobirds, different females within this single species specialize on different hosts. The pattern of mitochondrial differentiation among cuckoo females using different hosts species is simi? lar to that observed among indigobird spe? cies and supports the long-standing hypoth? esis that cuckoos are divided into distinct host races or "gentes." In contrast to indigobirds, however, host-specialization has not lead to speciation because male cuckoos mate with females irrespective of the host species that reared them.

The trypsinogen-like protease ancestor of the antarctic notothenioid anti? freeze glycogen is a novel serine protease.

The an? cestral gene that gave rise to the AFGP gene was that of a trypsinogen-like protease (TLP), but whether TLP is the trypsinogen that per- forms digestive function in the notothenioids is not known. We have now cloned and se? quenced full length cDNA of both pancre? atic TLPs and digestive trypsinogens across notothenioid families, thereby establishing that they are two distinct groups of pancre? atic proteases.

Immunolocaiiza-tion and gene expression of Na,K-ATPase in gills of the grapsid crab Pachygrapsus marmoratus. The activity, immunolocalization, and mRNA expression of Na,K-ATPase were studied in gills of the hyper-/ hypoosmoregulating crab Pachygrapsus marmoratus acclimated to salinities of 10, 37, and 45 ppt. Enzyme activity was sig? nificantly higher in pooled posterior gills (7-9) than in anterior gills (1-6) and in? creased significantly upon acclimation to diluted medium, confirming previous ob? servations with other crab species. Immu- nofluorescent analysis of gill sections in? dicated localization of Na,K-ATPase pro? tein in basolateral membranes of branchial epithelium adjacent to the afferent blood vessel. Using degenerate primers based on Na,K-ATPase ALPHA subunit homolo? gies published in GenBank, we amplified related sequences in cDNA transcribed from gill mRNA and employed the result? ing PCR products for sequencing and mRNA expression analyses. Immunofluo- rescence and mRNA quantitation pro? duced parallel results, showing high ex? pression of Na,K-ATPase protein and mRNA in gills 6, 7, and 8 at low salinity. In gills 6 and 8, the abundance of Na,K-AT? Pase protein and mRNA increased dra? matically with decreasing salinity. How? ever, gill 7 showed substantial levels of Na,K-ATPase protein and mRNA even in 45 ppt seawater, suggesting that this gill may play an important role in hypoosmoregulation. Our results offer a molecular explanation for the previously observed changes in Na,K-ATPase activ? ity in gills of euryhaline crabs adjusting to osmoregulatory demands in salinity ex? tremes, namely the upregulation of Na,K- ATPase gene transcription and subse- quent translation of Na,K-ATPase protein.

Condition-dependent acoustic signals and their importance for resolving aggressive conflicts in the skunk loach (Botia morleti): integrating sensory and behavioral ap? proaches. In the skunk loach, Botia morleti (Pisces, Cobitidae) sounds are produced during ag? gressive contests over access to hiding places. These contests are costly for both contestants and signals that act honesty (re- liably) to indicate fighting ability could func? tion to minimize these costs. We examined whether sounds produced during contests act as honest signals in B. morleti.To test this hypothesis we first quantified the relation? ship between sound characteristics and en? ergetic state (condition index) and docu? mented a positive correlation between con? dition index and peak-to-peak sound pres? sure level (loudness). Thus acoustic signals could be used to avoid costly escalations with fish in better condition, i.e., superior competitors. We then manipulated the hear? ing ability of individual contestants to deter? mine whether signal misperception altered contest dynamics in a manner that was con? sistent with honest signaling, i.e., are esca? lations with superior competitors more com? mon when signals are misper-ceived? We will present the results of this experiment. P3.100 SPEES, J.L*, CHANG, S. A., SNYDER, M.J, CHANG, ES., University of California, Davis. Interactive effects of os? motic and thermal stress on stress-respon- sive gene expression in the american lob? ster, Homarus americanus. Organisms in nature experience multiple environmental stressors simultaneously. For marine animals such as the American lob? ster, Homarus americanus, osmotic and ther? mal stress often occur concurrently or in close temporal proximity. Presently however, few studies have examined the molecular basis for responding to multiple stressors or 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

To this end, we first characterized the effects of hypo- and hyper-osmotic stress on the lobster for 0.5,1, and 2 h. We quan? tified the expression of the molecular chap? erone HSP90 (an indicator of reversible pro? tein damage) and polyubiquitin (an indica? tor of irreversible protein damage) as mea? sures of cellular perturbation in abdominal muscle and hepatopancreas (a digestive tis? sue). We then exposed lobsters to either a 2 h hypo- or hyper-osmotic stress followed immediately by a 2 h thermal stress and a brief recovery (3 h). Balanced design two- way ANOVA was used to detect interactions between salinity exposure and treatment time in the first experiment and to detect in? teractions between osmotic and thermal stress in the second experiment. Significant interactions were found between salinity exposure and treatment time for both HSP90 mRNA levels as well as polyubiquitin mRNA levels for hepatopancreas; such interactions were not observed for abdominal muscle. However, osmotic and thermal stress did interact significantly to alter the expression of both HSP90 and polyubiquitin in abdomi? nal muscle, as well as HSP90 expression in hepatopancreas. Polyubiquitin mRNA lev? els in hepatopancreas, although significantly higher than control levels, did not display a significant interaction between osmotic and thermal stress.

While our knowledge of cardiovascular function in adult crustaceans is reasonable, our understanding of how that function comes into being during ontogeny is still, quite literally, embryonic. In this presenta? tion I will briefly outline the different patterns of the onset and development of cardiac function in different crustacean groups. Thereafter our current understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the development of cardiac regulation will be presented to? gether with an assessment of future research priorities. Finally the wider importance of studying the development of cardiac func? tion will be explored. This includes using the crustacean heart as a model for studying the ontogeny of physiological regulation and linking life history characteristics to heart rate variability during early development.

Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) treat? ment results in time- and dose-dependent increases in tissue glucose levels in the penaeid shrimp Sicyonia ingentis. Insulin-like growth factors (IGF) are im? portant regulators of vertebrate growth and development. We have previously reported on the identity of IGF-like mRNA in decapod crustacean muscles. The role(s) of IGFs, such as IGF-I, in invertebrate systems remains un- clear. In this study, we examined the in vivo effects of IGF-I treatment on glucose levels in Sicyonia ingentis. We show that IGF-I in? jections promote both dose- and time- de? pendent increases in abdominal muscle and hepatopancreas glucose levels. Hepato? pancreas samples collected 15 min post- IGF-I injection (0.2 MUg/g wet wt.) had mean glucose levels approximately 30% higher than both non-injected and control-injected (0.2 MUg /g wet wt.) shrimp. Glucose levels were still 22% higher 30 min post-injection. Mean glucose levels in abdominal muscle samples 15 min after treatment were un? changed from controls, but at 30 min levels were elevated to 23.2% above controls. Our work demonstrates that IGF-I elicits a dis? tinct metabolic response n this species. The rapid physiological effects suggest that an IGF-like peptide may regulate key metabolic processes in this decapod crustacean.

Excretion in the house cricket, Acheta domesticus: ef? fects of cAMP on membrane dynamics, cell ultrastructure and secretion. In Acheta domesticus, the Malpighian tubules (Mt) are composed of three regions, each consisting of a single cell type. The cells of the mid-tubule display the classic archi- 1218 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="295">tecture of transport epithelia, possessing ex? tensive basolateral infoldings and a dense brush border. The mid-tubule is secretory in function and responds to endocrine stimu? lation. Our research centers on correlating the physiological response of the mid-tubule with the structural changes within the cells following the addition of various secreta- gogues. One of the most striking ultrastruc? tural changes occurs when the Mt are stimu? lated with the second messenger analogue, dibutyryl cAMRThe increase in secretion rate (approximately doubling) is accompanied by notable changes in ultrastructure, the most prominent being membrane re-organization to increase the surface area of the basolateral infolds and vesiculation. The extensive pattern of endomembrane distri? bution noted in unstimulated tissue disap- pears following stimulation and the concre- tions (spherites) begin to dissolve. The area of the cell given over to vesicles/vacuoles more than doubles over 420 s post-stimula- tion. We followed the membrane dynamics of the mid-tubule using TEM, SEM coupled with freeze-cleaving followed by extraction of the cytosol, and various fluorescent trac- ers. Using this SEM technique (developed in our laboratory) we were able to observe the increase in basolateral infoldings along with the presence of dilated areas of mem? brane suggestive of the vesiculation pattern of stimulated tissue previously observed with TEM. Our findings suggest that there is an intricate endomembrane network that ve- siculates in response to rapid fluid transport possibly to compartmentalize fluid to pre- vent dilution of the cytoplasm.

With regard to prey motion, the evolution of mimicry has been investigated in three areas: 1) locomotor mimicry, 2) anti-apostatic selection, and 3) escape mimicry. Locomo? tor mimicry is the similarity in motion of two distantly-related prey species. Because of evolutionary convergence in key morpho? logical features that are relevant to flight, con? vergence in the flight behavior of distasteful, mimetic passion-vine butterflies in the ge? nus Heliconius was predicted. Applying a methodology developed in CR Ellingtonfs laboratory, I present evidence that mimetic Heliconius are more similar in wingbeat fre? quency and the degree of asymmetry in the wing motion than they are to their sister spe? cies. Anti-apostatic selection, or selection against odd individuals, may be the selec? tive force for behavioral similarity among MJIerian mimics. Prey motion increases se? lection against odd individuals when prey are at high densities, and perhaps when the prey are M Jlerian mimics. Ultimately, the be? haviors of the different mimetic morphs should converge on that behavior which minimizes the energetic cost of flight. Apply? ing Ellingtonis aerodynamic models, I esti? mated the energetic cost of each mimetic morphis flight behavior in order to qualita- tively predict the difference in height of each fitness peak and the direction of convergent selection. Following adjustments for body mass, mimetic H melpomene and H erato required more aerodynamic power than H. cydno and H sapho. This difference was at? tributed to the slower flight speeds and higher wingbeat frequencies of H. melpomene and H erato. From morphology, locomotor mimicry with important limitations is also predicted to occur in palatable spe? cies that appear like distasteful models (Ba- tesian mimics), and among palatable spe? cies that are color mimetic due to unprofit- able prey (or escape) mimicry. 5.4 STACH, T*, TURBEVILLE, J.

Aplousobranch ascidians were included in a molecular phylogenetic analysis for the first time. COI data and the combined analy? sis of COI data and morphological charac? ters do not support monophyly of the Aplousobranchiata, whereas morphological characters suggest monophyly. When a single aplousobranch species is included, Appendicularia (= Larvacea) nest within the Ascidiacea in the analysis of the preliminary 18S rDNA data and the combined molecu? lar (18S rDNA) and morphological analysis. In the morphological analysis Agnesiidae and Octacnemidae (= Hypobythiidae) nest within the Phlebobranchiata (Entero-gona). Morphological evidence suggests that the Sorberacea (= Aspiraculata), traditionally thought to represent a separate tunicate class, are aberrant pleurogonid deep-sea ascidians, constituting the sister group of the Molgulidae. No molecular data exist for Agnesiidae, Octacnemidae, and Sorberacea. Morphological character evo? lution and implications for the reconstruc? tion of the chordate groundplan will be dis? cussed. The preliminary results show that more molecular and morphological data are needed to reliably resolve tunicate and as? cidian phylogeny and acquisition of these data is currently underway. P2.79STAKEBAKE, EF, MEYERS, R.A*, Weber State University, Ogden, UT The al- batross shoulder lock: a biomechanical and immunohistochemical study. As a postural behavior, gliding and soar- ing flight in birds requires less energy than flapping flight. Slow tonic and slow twitch muscle fibers are specialized for sustained contraction with high fatigue resistance and are typically found in muscles associated with posture. Albatrosses are the elite of avian gliders; as such we wanted to learn how their musculoskeletal system enables them to maintain spread-wing posture for prolonged gliding bouts. We used dissec- tion and immunohistochemistry to evaluate muscle function for gliding flight in Laysan and Black-footed Albatrosses. Albatrosses possess a locking mechanism at the shoul? der; internal and external tendinous sheets extend from origin to insertion throughout the length of the deep layer of the pectoralis muscle. This fascial "struf passively main- tains horizontal wing orientation during glid? ing and soaring flight. A number of muscles, which likely facilitate gliding posture, were found to be comprised exclusively of slow fibers. These include Mm. coracobrachialis cranialis, extensor metacarpi radialis dor- salis and deep pectoralis. In addition, a num? ber of other muscles, including triceps scapularis, supracoracoideus, and extensor metacarpi radialis ventralis, were found to have populations of slow fibers. We believe that this suite of uniformly slow muscles is associated with sustained gliding and is unique to birds that perform such behaviors. These findings demonstrate that albatrosses utilize a combination of slow muscle fibers and a rigid limiting tendon for maintaining prolonged, gliding posture. 43.5 STARCK, JM, University of Jena. Mor? phological flexibility of the intestine of snakes. The small intestine of snakes responds to feeding by rapid upregulation of organ size. After absorption of nutrients the small intestine size is down regulated to fasting size. The mechanisms of the morphological flexibility of the small intestine are compared in Burmese pythons (Python molurus bivittatus) which are infrequent feeding 'sit and waif foraging snakes, and red sided garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis)\Nh\ch are actively hunting and fre- quently feeding snakes. Ultrasonography, light microscopy, transmission electron mi? croscopy, and flow cytometry were used to study the mechanisms of small intestine size response to feeding. Independent of the feed? ing strategies, both species showed the same responsiveness of the small intestine to feeding and the small intestine had the same histological architecture. The mucosal epithelium a was a transitional (pseudo- stratified) epithelium that allowed for size changes without production of new tissue. Driving force of the size increase were a fluid pressure pump (lymph and blood pressure) and incorporation of lipid droplets into the enterocytes. No cell proliferation was asso? ciated with upregulation of organ size. In? stead, cell proliferation, i.e., production of 1220 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="297">new tissue was observed during down regu? lation of organ size. A possible explanation is that cells that deteriorated during absorp? tion of nutrients were replaced when diges? tion and absorption ended. Based on pre? liminary comparative evidence it is sug? gested that the described histological prop? erties of the small intestine are an ancestral feature of snakes, and, possibly, of other non? avian sauropsids (supported by German Re? search Council STA 345/5-1).

Measures of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) may by used as a gauge of developmental stability of various traits in growing animals; i.e., a high level of FA indicates labile devel? opment while low levels of FA stand for sta- bile development. In this study, we asked (1) whether levels of FA change during devel? opment, and (2) whether interactions be? tween environment and organism affect FA. In detail, we asked whether coefficients of variation (CV) of morphometric measure? ments as well as their FAs change during ontogeny. Further, we addressed the ques? tion whether interactions between the envi? ronment and the growing organism affected FAs and patterns of morphological develop? ment. We studied developing tarsometatar- sus of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) from its first occurrence on embryonic day 5 to adulthood. Coefficients of variation of tar? sal length were high during early and mid embryogenesis. Coefficients of Variation and level of FA began to decline briefly before hatching. A sudden and distinct drop of mea? sured FA occurred immediately after hatch? ing. During posthatching development, mea? sures of FA continued to decline to low adult values. If signed asymmetry was recorded for each day post-hatching, we observed a clear pattern of alternating asymmetry. Con? clusions from our study are that (1) degree of developmental stabilization (canalization) increases during ontogeny. (2) The steep decline of FA immediately after hatching sug? gests that organism environment interactions are an important contribution to shaping the phenotype, i.e., reduce asymmetry, and (3) time series of alternating asymmetry sug? gest compensatory growth and left-right sig? naling during growth of tarsus. S9.1 STEFANO, G.B., State University New York, Old Westbury. The beginnings of the stress response: opioid modulation in inver? tebrates. It is evident that chemical signal mol? ecules mediate intercellular communication. During evolution, organisms using this form of communication have increased their chances of survival, passing this trait on to their descendents. Chemical communica? tion exhibits a greater level of sophistica- tion, i.e., synaptic, hormonal. The end result of such chemical-communication mecha? nisms would be a higher degree of sophisti- cation and detailed information transfer, which allows for a greater number of behav? ioral characteristics (including afferent hor? monal influences), enhancing an organism's chance for survival in a changing environ? ment. Periodically, environmental changes may represent an immediate adverse event, regardless of where an organism is on the evolutionary tree. In this regard, concerning any organism, a correct response to ensure survival is required: thus, the presence of morphine and proenkephalin, prodynorphin and proopiomelanocortin, and their derived peptides. In simple animals, the presence of such derived peptides is not surprising since they must respond to similar chal? lenges from the environment, i.e., bacterial. Given the success of these signal molecules in modulating the internal stress response in invertebrates, they must have been con? served during evolution, presumably be? cause the signaling process was so difficult to achieve in the first place. Recent findings not only document the invertebrate presence of signal molecules, exhibiting high se? quence identity associated with the "mam? malian" hypothalamic-pituitary -adrenal axis but, their receptors as well. All in all, it ap? pears that the mammalian "stress-associ- ated" processes first existed in invertebrates, if not earlier. In this regard, evolution simply placed cognition on this basic foundation in man. 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Biochemical changes in loco? motor muscle of harbor porpoise, Phocoena phocoena, during starvation. A primary locomotor muscle (M. longissi? mus) of stranded, emaciated porpoises was compared to that of robust porpoises killed in fishing operations. We previously demon? strated that emaciated porpoises displayed decreases in body mass, axial locomotor muscle mass, M. longissimus muscle fiber diameters and fast twitch fiber-type areas equivalent to, or greater than, that seen in laboratory animals undergoing starvation. This study investigates changes in muscle biochemical profiles of starved (n=5) and ro? bust (n=4) porpoises. A suite of enzymes were assayed representing glycolysis, lipid oxidation, citric acid cycle, and amino acid oxidation. We report here the activities (MUmoles/min.*g wet wt.) for citrate synthase (CS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and hex- okinase (HK). CS was chosen as a repre? sentative enzyme for the citric acid cycle; we hypothesized its relative activity would in? crease during starvation because of the in? creased need for lipid oxidation. LDH was chosen to monitor the muscle's anaerobic metabolism; we hypothesized its relative activity would decrease because of the in? creased atrophy of fast twitch fibers. HK was chosen as a representative enzyme for gly? colysis; we hypothesized its relative activity would decrease because of the loss of gly? cogen during starvation. Our results showed that CS increased by 49%, LDH decreased by 40%, HK decreased by 35% and the ra? tio CS/LDH increased by 37% in starved animals. These results support the his? tochemical study and suggest a transition to the use of oxidative slow twitch fibers as the reliance of metabolic fuel changes from glu? cose to lipid during starvation.

Age- related differences in digestive function dur? ing migration in the Western sandpiper (Calidris mauri). It is common practice to use species' mean values of standardized measures, such as BMR, to evaluate changes in en? ergy demands. However, relying upon spe? cies' mean values becomes problematic when age-related differences are large and are not accounted for. The problem becomes pronounced when conservation decisions are being made, i.e. preservation of particu? lar migratory stop-over sites, on the basis of these measures. I use the digestive tract as a model system to evaluate individual per? formance in relation to meeting the ener? getic demands of migration. I evaluated func? tional aspects of the digestive tract at three levels: a) uptake rates across epithelium us? ing the everted sleeve, b) morphology (his? tological analysis) and c) activities of two digestive enzymes (pancreatic lipase and aminopeptidase-N) in three age-classes of the Western Sandpiper (Calidris mauri) dur? ing migration. I present these data in the context of whole organism performance and differences in energy demands for the dif? ferent age-classes. In particular I will show that there appear to be problems associated with the use of the everted sleeve method (extensive tissue damage during eversion) in free-living birds (cf. captive birds that have been used in many previous studies). This may relate to changes in gut structure asso? ciated with captivity per se. 68.3 STEVENSON, R.D, University of Mas? sachusetts Boston.

Morphological heterogeneity among zooids of encrusting colonies of Membranipora membranacea induces pas? sive flow through the colony. Encrusting bryozoans live in a velocity gradient at the base of momentum bound? ary layers in the fluid environment in which they live. As suspension feeders, their inter? action with the surrounding fluid is impor? tant in filter-feeding success, which is pro? portional to competitive ability and fitness of the colony. Active ciliary pumping by indi? vidual zooids of Membranipora mem? branacea creates incurrent flow that passes over tentacled-lophophores and is expelled in 'chimneys'; regions of non-feeding zooids surrounded by feeding zooids that have lo- phophores that are -2x taller than the lo- phophores of non-chimney feeding zooids. This study was conducted to investigate the possible induction of passive flow induced through the colony by the interaction of am? bient flow and this morphological heteroge? neity among zooids. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to quantify aver? age velocity of the excurrent flow from a chim? ney as a function of ambient flow speed. There was a significant correlation between the velocity in the vertical direction through the chimney and ambient horizontal veloc? ity in the horizontal direction. This suggests that there may be induced flow through colo? nies with chimneys, even at the low Reynolds number that characterizes the fluid environ? ment in which they live. 45.4 STEWART, J.R.*, HEULIN, B., East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, Station Biologique de Paimpont, France. Ontogeny ofthe extraembryonic membranes in oviparous viviparous lizards, Lacerta vivipara. Lacerta vivipara is a reproductively bi? modal species with allopatrically distributed viviparous and oviparous populations. Mor? phological, ecological and genetical simi? larities among populations indicate that oviparous and viviparous populations are closely related and diverged recently. This species provides a rare opportunity among squamate reptiles to compare the influence of reproductive mode on intraspecific varia? tion in development of the extraembryonic membranes. We studied ontogeny of the extraembryonic membranes of an oviparous population for comparison with classical and recent studies of viviparous populations. Morphogenesis of the yolk cleft and isolated yolk mass is typical for Squamata. The yolk cleft extends across the abembryonic sur? face of the yolk vesicle shortly after oviposi? tion. The allantoic vesicle fills the embryonic hemisphere of recently oviposited eggs and a vascularized chorioallantoic membrane contacts the eggshell over the surface of this hemisphere. The isolated yolk mass has regressed and the chorioallantoic mem? brane completely encircles the egg in near- term embryos; both of these events are char? acteristic of other oviparous lizards. How? ever, one component of the ontogeny of the yolk sac has not been reported in other spe? cies. The novel feature is a secondary yolk 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Did animals' bodies evolve such that ca? pacities of body components are matched efficiently to maximum natural loads, war- ranting the motto "enough but not too much"? Series pathways raise a further question in design optimality: do all steps have similar capacities, or is there a single rate-limiting step? Nutrient processing involves energeti? cally expensive organs arranged in series: absorption in the intestine, metabolism in the liver, circulation by the heart, oxidation by lung gases, and waste excretion by the kidney. Thus, we tested concepts of design economy for the gut vis-a-vis other organs that process nutrients. A practical problem in exploring organ matches of nutrient pro? cessing capacities is that nutrients normally reach other organs from the intestine, so that the nutrient loads on those other organs can? not be separately manipulated. We circum- vented this problem by nourishing labora? tory rats with total parenteral nutrition (TPN)- a clinical procedure for delivering nutrients directly into the circulation of human patients. TPN permits us to administer an identical liquid nutrient mix to rats either as TPN or oral feeding. Thus, under circumstances of nourishing a rat with TPN, with any potential intestinal bottleneck eliminated, can the rat process far more nutrients than its intestine can absorb? Or are processing rates of other gut organs matched to intestinal absorption rates? Or can the intestine absorb nutrients faster than other organs can process them?

Antifreeze potenti- ating protein in Antarctic notothenioid fishes. The ability of Antarctic notothenioid fishes to survive in ice-laden waters at -1.9?C has been attributed to a group of antifreeze gly? coproteins (AFGPs). In the absence of AFGPs, the freezing point of body fluids in the fish would be approximately -1?C due to colligative properties. By binding to ice crys? tals and inhibiting their growth, AFGPs sup? press the freezing point another 1.2? C. To? gether, this gives an organismal freezing point of about -2.2? C, sufficient for the fish to avoid freezing. However, it has also been observed that the freezing point of native notothenioid fish serum can reach as low as -2.7? C, suggesting that another factor is ac? tive in preventing ice growth. We have now discovered a second ice-active serum pro? tein. Alone, this protein displays weak anti? freeze activity and does not contribute the remainder of the observed activity in native serum. However, when mixed with AFGPs 1-5, it was found to potentiate antifreeze ac? tivity up to 5 or 6 fold, thus accounting for the full freezing point depression observed in native serum. This protein, called antifreeze potentiating protein (AFPP), has a molecu? lar weight of 15,489 kD. It is present at vari? able concentrations (1 - 4 mg/ml) in the blood of notothenioids; the highest value found in species associated with the iciest habitats. Proteolytic digestion and protein sequence analysis has yielded partial sequences that appear to contain a repeated Ser-Ala-Gly motif. Current work is focusing on the use of primers derived from the protein sequence to generate full length AFPP cDNA by RT- PCR. There are no current sequences in the data similar to the AFPP partial sequence. Therefore AFPP is a novel ice-binding pro? tein that together with AFGPs forms the first example of a two-protein antifreeze system in fish.

Evolution of sexual dimor- phisms in spottail darters (Teleostei: percidae): fitness sets, phylogenetics, and a test of the egg-mimic hypothesis. I investigated the dynamics between re? productive ecology and morphological phe? notypes among spottail darters by develop? ing a fitness set model. Spottail darters ex? hibit two types of sexual dimorphism, and both presumably related to male resource- defense polygyny. My model considers male phenotypes as conflicting signals in mate choice behavior. Large male size is an hon? est signal in my model, by which large males obtain and defend better nests. Female choice for large males increases female fit? ness. Males of some species develop large knobs supported by rays of the second dor? sal fin. Fin knobs are hypothesized to act as egg-mimics used to attract receptive females, if females selectively deposit their eggs in nests that already contain eggs despite the size of the male guarding that nest. Egg- mimicry is a false signal in my model. Fe? male choice for males exhibiting egg-mim? ics may decrease female fitness when nest sites are limiting. Medium size males with small knobs are at a disadvantage in my model, as they lack the large size required to acquire nest sites and effective egg-mim? ics. Phylogenetic relationship among spottail darters is consistent with the model: Large egg-mimics evolve twice, and are always associated with a reduction in male size. Species in which egg-mimicry is maintained occur in habitats in which nest sites are not limiting. Further, large male size has re- evolved in one species restricted to nest- poor habitats with a simultaneous reduction in egg- mimics.

Biological principals that drive digital effects and strategies of ani? mation: trading lessons between vertebrate mechanics and commercial entertainment. Comparative morphological studies and responsible strategies of animation (both tra- ditionally hand-drawn and computer gener? ated) both require an understanding of struc? ture, function, ontogenetic variation, and sexual dimorphism. Within animation, differ? ent techniques utilize slightly differing em- phases. Traditional hand-drawn animation is focuses on superficial musculoskeletal anatomy. Dietary strategy (carnivory, her? bivory, or others) informs the type the basic musculoskeletal patterns and locomotor be? havior employed. Digitally created animal characters demand intimate knowledge of the skeleton as a first principal, as it is a skel? etal wireframe that drives the movement of the character. Current standards require that the underlying skeleton (usually simplified) drive the movement of modeled soft tissue. It may be argued that restricting study or analy? sis to external structures, or having bones move muscles (as opposed to the converse) represent inappropriate approaches to study and representation of movement. This per? spective is shortsighted. Rather, these nec? essary approaches present "exercises" or "problems" that may be solved with a thor- ough knowledge of how integrated biome? chanical systems operate. More extreme "ex? ercises" are presented by the needs of com? mercially driven storylines. Dinosaurs and mammals don't speak. Puppies aren't nor? mally found in litters of over 100, or even 101, individuals. Graviportal elephants are incapable of galloping and an extended phase floating. Hybrid organisms composed of taxa that crisscross the range of vertebrate classes do not exist in the real world. How? ever, if they did, how would you solve the problems?

In seeking common patterns, we restrict ourselves to transitions that: (1) characterise what have traditionally been referred to as "classes" of vertebrates; and (2) reflect, as least in part, significant envi? ronmental changes. The beginning and end of the water to land transition (origin of tetra? pods and origin of amniotes), and the dino? saur to bird transition may each be characterised by the exploitation of a new niche (or niches), be they physiographic, physiological or both. Most transitions pro? vided profound new opportunities for habi? tat use, food acquisition, and predator avoid? ance. Features of transitions between major groups may be obvious from fossils, only indirectly evident, or not at all discernible. Respective examples include: the develop? ment of weight-bearing limbs in basal tetra? pods (obvious), addition of a slow-opening phase to prey capture in basal amniotes (in? direct evidence from morphology), and po? tential refinement of endothermy related to pre-existing insulating structures (primitive feathers inherited from mani-raptoran theropod dinosaurs) in basal birds. This last transition is a matter of some recent media attention, but no controversy about bird ori? gins actually exists, as all phylogenetic analy? ses exclude Longisquama from close rela? tionship with birds, its possession of "feath? ers" remains contentious, and many the ar? guments to support its supposed relation? ships to birds are those previously used to reject a theropod relatiionship with birds.

Ontogeny of the hornshark chondrocranium and the evolu? tion of trabecular cartilage. The skeleton of the sharks, rays, and chimaeroids is composed of cartilage, some of which is calcified. The vertebrae are com? pletely calcified, while the remainder of the skeleton has one or more thin layers of cal? cified blocks (tesserae) covering a core of uncalcified cartilage. In a clade of stingrays containing hard prey specialists an internal network of calcified struts augments the sur? face calcification. This strut-reinforced tissue is called trabecular cartilage. Some sharks, most notably the heterodontids, also eat hard prey. We examined a size series of Heterodontus francisci with a high resolu? tion CT scanner for evidence of trabecular cartilage and to examine the morphology of the jaw joint. The CT scans and dissection revealed no trace of trabeculae. The jaw mechanism is the mechanical antithesis of that of the hard prey crushing stingrays. The rays have a well-calcified symphysis but the upper and lower jaws meet at a joint that has a large uncalcified region. In contrast heterodontids have an extremely loose, uncalcified, ligamentous symphysis and the upper and lower jaw joints form a well-calci? fied hinge joint. This raises the possibility that the left and right side of the shark's jaws work as levers with the fulcrum at the joint. Dis? section of other shark taxa that are reported to eat hard prey, Sphyrna tiburo and Orectolobus ornatus, did not reveal any tra? becular cartilage. Trabecular cartilage ap? pears to be an evolutionary innovation, con- fined to the myliobatid stingrays that allows them to eat harder prey than other cartilagi? nous fishes.

Behavioral interaction during social situa- tions is a continuum of action, response, and reaction. The temporal nature of social inter? action creates a series of stressful situations, such as aggression, displacement from re? sources, and the persistent psychological threat accompanying social hierarchy. The ebb and flow of neurochemical and endo? crine secretions during social stress provide a unique tool for understanding individual- ized responses to stress. Each social station is an adaptive response to a stressful social condition, resulting in unique neuroendo? crine and behavioral responses. By exam? ining the temporal changes of limbic monoamines and plasma glucocorticoids, aspects of mechanisms for adaptation emerge. The similarity of temporal patterns 1226 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="303">induced by social stress among fish, rep? tiles and primates are remarkable. Even dif? ferent specific coping mechanisms point out the similarity of vertebrate stress responses. The lizard Anolis carolinensis exhibits a unique sign stimulus generated during so? cial stress by the sympathetic nervous sys? tem that serves as a temporal landmark to distinguish neuroendocrine patterns. During social interaction dominant males have a shorter latency to eyespot darkening than opponents, inhibiting aggressive display. Eyespot coloration can be delayed using a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, causing domi? nant social status in many animals to be lost. Reversal of social status via serotonergic activation appears to mimic chronic sero? tonergic activity. The pattern of eyespot dark? ening, faster in dominant males, is coinci- dent with that for serotonergic activity. The fundamental temporal relationship between dominant and subordinate limbic monoam- inergic activity over a continuous course of social interaction appears to be a two-phase response, temporally specific to brain re? gion, and always faster in dominant indi? viduals.

Packaging and placement of offspring is an important aspect of life history because it can directly affect fitness in terms of offspring survival. Previous studies addressing the effect of egg mass structure on embryo suc? cess suggest that, due to a lower oxygen diffusion coefficient in aquatic environments, increasing egg mass size without compen? sation for spacing, size, or number of em? bryos decreases embryo survival. Female apple murex snails, Phyllonotus pomum, ex? hibit communal egg-laying in which numer? ous females simultaneously lay clutches of egg capsules in a single mass. These masses can reach up to 2.3L. Because of the sheer size and 3-dimensional structure of these communal masses, I would expect to find a negative affect on juvenile success as mass size increases. Contrary to predictions based on empirical studies in other taxa, my data on Phyllonotus pomum show a trend of in? creasing juvenile number at time of hatch? ing with increasing mass size. This suggests that larger mass sizes may actually provide protection for developing embryos in cer? tain species.

Both the flight capabilities and the wing structure of extant bats are diverse, and many studies have sought the morphological ba? sis for bat flight performance, including ma? neuverability. Most analyses of the relation? ship between wing structure and flight ma? neuverability have selected descriptors of wing morphology based on the aerodynam- ics of fixed-wing aircraft. In particular, single values for wing area, wing loading, and as- pect ratio, defined at an estimated mid- downstroke posture, have been employed as descriptors. Here, we suggest that flap? ping flight, particularly the ability to perform three-dimensionally complex maneuvers, can be better related to wing design by mor? phological and kinematic descriptors that account for the intrinsically dynamic and three-dimensional nature of flight. We em? ploy three-dimensional kinematics of wild- caught bats in wind-tunnel and obstacle ar? ray flights to demonstrate the considerable variation in wing conformation that may be associated with given values of static mid- downstroke wing area, loading, and aspect ratio. We propose some descriptors of wing form based on three-dimensional kinemat? ics, and suggest directions for future work. 32.3 SWIDERSKI, DL, University of Michi? gan.

Geometric morphometric methods are free of this bias because size and shape are evaluated in- dependently. In this study, I am using geo? metric methods to examine patterns of varia? tion inthe lower jaw ofthe fox squirrel, Sciurus niger. Analyses of adult variation in two popu? lations indicate that shape features are not highly correlated with each other, or with size, in either population. Comparisons between the populations show that they differ in both size and shape of the jaw. However, the difference in shape is not consistent with ex- trapolation of juvenile growth from the smaller adult size to the larger adult size. These results indicate that evolution of jaw shape in squirrels may not be as constrained as previous studies suggested. 3.3 SYME, DA*, SHADWICK, R.E, Uni? versity ofCalgary, AB, Scripps Inst ofOcean- ography University of California. Mechani? cal power production by internal red muscle at different longitudinal body positions in skip- jack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) in relation to swimming. The work loop technique was used to study power output by internal red muscle from skipjacktuna, to understandthe primary function of this muscle in swimming, how different strain amplitudes at different muscle locations affect performance, and how work and power output are affected by swim speed. Red muscle was isolated from ante? rior (0.4L) and posterior (0.7L) positions (L=total body length) and subjected to sinu? soidal length changes and stimulus param? eters determined previously from swimming fish or those producing maximal net work, at 25?C. The optimum activation phase and duration decreased with increasing fre? quency, but were the same for anterior and posterior muscle. At test frequencies corre? sponding to tail beat frequencies used in steady swimming (3-5Hz) near maximal positive work was produced when the strain and activation conditions measured in swim? ming fish were used. Net work per cycle peaked at 2-3Hz and dropped to zero above 15 Hz. Maximum power occurred at 5Hz, but power production remained substantial be- yond 10 Hz. Compared to anterior muscle, posterior fibers had higher power output (133 vs 79 W/kg), significantly shorter twitch rise times (60 vs 80 ms), but similar relax? ation times. The close agreement between strain amplitude and activation parameters used in vivo and those producing maximum work per cycle in vitro, and the match be? tween the frequency for peak power and tail beat frequencies used for cruising suggest that tunas use red muscle all along the body for maximal power generation during steady swimming. The maintained power produc? tion at higher frequencies suggests that red muscle may also contribute power during fast swimming. S2.3 TABIN, T, Harvard Univ Med Sch. Genetic cassettes and the evolution of regu? latory networks patterning the embryo. As genetic regulatory networks underly? ing development have been uncovered in a variety of organisms, a recurring theme is that the same sets of genes often act in con- cert in different developmental pathways in the ontogeny of one organism and in both homologous and non-homologous settings in distantly related organisms. A challenge is to explain how such genetic "cassettes," have been co-selected. An interesting case is the cassette of Pax, eya, six, and dachs- hund genes, first described in the context of Drosophila eye development. There is a syn- ergistic regulation of eye formation by eya, so(a six gene)and dac. These genes are linked in their regulation so that each posi? tively affects the expression of the others. Moreover,all these genes participate in a positive feedback loop with the upstream gene eya, a Pax6 homologue. We have found that an analogous regulatory network in vertebrate muscle development involving eya2, sixl, dac2, and Pax3. Moreover, other members of these families are co-expressed during development of the vertebrate ear and eye. Several evolutionary issues need to be explored. The co-selection of eya, six and dac genes is likely driven by the fact that their gene products physically interact in a functional complex. Different family mem? bers may provide different specificities(and the same genes may also function indepen? dently of each other in different settings),but 1228 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="305">it is easy to imagine that expression of one would favor recruitment of a partner and subsequent linking of their regulation. Harder to explain is the similar epistatic relationship with different Pax genes, since they do not interact physically and the Pax genes in question are actually quite distantly related from one another. Finally not all the genetic interrelationships between these genes in the fly eye and vertebrate myogenic cells are recapitulated in the vertebrate eye and ear, which needs to be explained. 39.4 TAMMERO,LF*, DICKINSON, M.H., University of California, Berkeley. The pat? tern of optic flow determines flight behavior in freely flying Drosophila. While flying through its environment in search of food, a fruitfly (Drosophila) must integrate input from several sensory modali- ties. To study the behavioral patterns that emerge from the interactions of these sen? sory systems, we reconstructed three-dimen? sional trajectories from images taken by ste- reo infrared video cameras during free flight within a controlled arena. Flies move through their environment using a series of straight flight segments separated by rapid turns called saccades. Analysis of the trajectories suggests that saccades are fixed motor pat? terns that alter course by approximately 90 degrees. For eachposition in the flight tra? jectory, we calculated the fly's angular and translational velocities and reconstructed the visual environment from the fly's perspec? tive. From these reconstructions, we deter? mined the optic flow experienced by the fly during the course of its flight. Analysis of these data suggests that optic flow does not alter course direction during the straight seg? ments and that the mechano-sensory hal- teres, which act as an inertial guidance sys? tem, dominate this portion of free flight be? havior. However, reverse correlations of the spatially integrated optic flow suggest that image expansion is the signal that triggers saccades. In summary, our data suggest that complex behavioral patterns seen during free flight emerge from interactions between the flight control system and the visual envi? ronment. 39.3 TARSITANO, M.*, DICKINSON, M., University of California, Berkeley. Visual-ol- factory fusion in the flight behavior of Droso? phila. Food is often associated with odor, so olfaction is an important sense which ani? mals use to guide them to food. Course con? trol in insects, however, is strongly influenced by visual cues. We are testing Drosophila to see how the visual algorithms they use to control flight change to enable them to search for food in the presence of attractive odors. We examined the 3-D flight paths of flies within a 100 x 60 cm chamber under three conditions: with the wall of the cham? ber covered with a background of randomly distributed white and black squares, with the wall covered with a background but also with an odor source embedded in its floor, and with an odor but no visual background. The flies tended towards the middle of the arena when tested with the random background (condition #1). In addition, flies flew at a height between 200 and 300 mm. When tested with a background and an odor (con? dition #2), flies flew around the location of the odor and at a height between 0 to 100 mm. When flies were tested with an odor but no background (condition #3), they could not locate the odor in the horizontal plane. However, the flies flew at a height between 0-100 mm, the same altitude as per condi? tion #2. Our tests suggest that optic flow is required for the localization of an odor source. The process whereby one sensory modality (olfaction) modulates another sen? sory mediated behavior (vision) is termed 'sensory fusion'. It is not clear if the mecha? nism that enables a fly to localize the alti? tude of an odor source also requires visual input. In the case of vertical localization, flies might use the top and bottom edges of the arena as visual cues.

The circu? lating IGF/IGFBP complexes prolong the half-lives of IGFs and buffer the acute hy- poglycemic effects of IGFs. Locally ex? pressed IGFBPs may also provide a means of localizing IGFs in defined areas and may alter IGF bioactivity by modulating the ligand receptor interaction. In this paper, we report the cloning of an IGFBP cDNA from the gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata. The cDNA encodes a protein of 285 amino ac? ids. The primary structure of this protein is 43-49% identical to that of zebrafish, chicken, rat, mouse, and human. The se? quence identity of seabream IGFBP-2 with other human IGFBPs ranges from 28-34%. Northern blot analysis revealed that the seabream IGFBP-2 transcript is approxi? mately 1.8 kb and is highly expressed in the liver. Analysis of IGFBP-2 mRNA in various adult tissues using RT-PCR revealed its ex? pression in all tissues studied, with the high? est levels in liver, skin, gonad and pyloric caeca.The hepatic mRNA levels of IGFBP-2 were greatly reduced in growth hormone- treated animals. This data is in agreement with the role of IGFBP-2 function as a nega? tive growth regulator in the growth hormone- IGF-I axis. Transcripts for IGFBP2 were de? tected throughout early development in un- fertilized eggs, embryos and larvae, with highest levels observed on days 3-6 after hatching, suggesting that this mRNA is the product of both the maternal and embryonic genomes. These data suggest that IGFBP- 2 is expressed from the earliest stages of development and may play an important role in regulating growth and development in fish (Supported by BARD Grant IS-2769096R and NSF Grant IBN-9728911).

Contraction of ovaries has been dem? onstrated in the mummichog, Fundulus heteroclitus and several other teleosts. We have expanded this information by record? ing spontaneous contractions and the re? sponse to acetylcholine in ovaries of the striped killifish, Fundulus majalis, the Atlan- tic silverside, Menidia menidia, and the pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus sus? pended in a smooth muscle bath containing a modified Ringer's solution. Ovaries of all three species produced similar contractions in response to 10 5 M acetylcholine. Spon? taneous contractions in F. majalis, and M. menidia occurred in a series of single peaks with frequencies and amplitudes similar to the pattern previously observed in F. heteroclitus. Those seen in L. gibbosus had a lower frequency and greater amplitude, with a series of superimposed higher fre? quency contractions. These results suggest that ovarian contraction may be a common phenomenon in the Antherinidae and Fundulidae which share many reproductive characteristics including the occurrence of semilunar reproductive cycles. The Centrarchidae are nest-building Percoids which are taxonomically distant from the other species analyzed. 52.3 TELANG, A.*, CHAPMAN, R.F, WHEELER, D.E., University of Arizona. Sexual differences in protein and carbohy? drate utilization by larval tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (f.). Female Lepidoptera are often heavier than males, presumably due to greater food consumption. Our previous studies indicated that female Heliothis virescens caterpillars use both feeding and post-ingestive pro? cessing as mechanisms to meet nutrient needs. Our present report focuses on the latter mechanism. Post-ingestive responses to four different diets containing protein and carbohydrate at various concentrations were analyzed for fifth stadium Heliothis virescens caterpillars of both sexes. Amounts eaten, excreted and used toward growth were mea? sured across the fifth stadium. Both female and male larvae differentially utilized in? gested protein and carbohydrate with fe? males achieving greater mean relative growth rate and protein-derived growth on all four diets. Results suggests that females are capable of more efficiently utilizing in? gested protein toward such growth. Chemi? cal analyses of frass nitrogen content sug? gest that ammonia excretion may be em? ployed by caterpillars under high protein, low carbohydrate diet conditions. 1230 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

Freshwater mussels are an important group of animals inhabiting the rivers and lakes of North America. Many native popu? lations of freshwater mussels in the Adirondack highlands and St. Lawrence low- lands have been lost or are endangered because of the introduction of the exotic spe? cies Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussels) and Dreissena bugensis (quagga mussels). The loss of populations within the range of a species may significantly effect the genetic diversity contained within that species. Here, we examine the genetic variation at two mi? tochondrial loci of the freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata. Fifty E complanatawere collected from fifteen sites in northern New York. After isolating DNA from individuals, nested PCR protocols were used to amplify a 400 bp segment of the cytochrome C oxi? dase subunit I (CO I) gene and a 362 bp segment of the 16s rRNA gene. Variation among PCR products for each gene were screened using single stranded polymor? phism conformation analysis (SSCP). Initial SSCP analysis revealed six CO I alleles and four 16s rRNA alleles. To identify how PCR products of each gene differed, we cloned and sequenced each PCR product. We use the DNA sequences of the CO I and 16s rRNA genes to assess genetic diversity and evaluate the roles of historical and contem- porary processes in determining the genetic variation within E complanata populations in northern New York. 68.4 TEMPLE, J.

Snakes, as classic ectotherms, are inter? esting subjects for studying the relationship between temperature and physiological pro? cesses. They are particularly well-suited for studying digestive passage rate given the linear anatomical arrangement of their di? gestive tracts. In this paper, a simple and in- expensive laboratory exercise in which your students can design and carry out an ex? periment to track the passage of an ingested meal through the digestive system of the garter snake (Genus Thamnophis) is de? scribed. Teflon-coated micro stir bars are placed in a meal and their location in the snake is determined using a standard com- pass. Using the guided inquiry approach, the students are provided background infor? mation on the topic and the experimental techniques, and they are then allowed to develop their own hypotheses and design their own experiments with guidance from the instructor. The digestive passage rate is determined over a range of temperatures, and the direct relationship between tem? perature and digestive passage rate can be easily demonstrated using relatively small sample sizes. This exercise is effective for discussions of comparative physiology and anatomy in vertebrates. The straightforward technique can be easily modified to fit the needs of courses with all levels of students. S4.1 TERWILLIGER, N.B., RYAN, M., Uni? versity of Oregon, Charleston. Ontogeny of crustacean respiratory proteins. The respiratory proteins hemocyanin (Hc) and hemoglobin (Hb) share the func? tion of oxygen transport, but the proteins, their active sites and the metal ions that bind the oxygen are totally different. Either Hc or Hb, but not both, is expressed in the hemolymph of many arthropod crustaceans. Hb is present in Branchiopoda, Ostracoda, Copepoda, rhizocephalan Cirripedia and one suborder of amphipodan Malacostraca while Hc has been described in Malacostraca. Recent work by several labo- ratories have provided new information on the gene structure, site of synthesis and ex? pression of branchiopod Hbs and suggests they are excellent model organisms for stud? ies of hypoxia sensors and oxygen response elements during development and adult stages. Studies on Hc ontogeny have shown functional changes in Nephrops and Homarus Hcs.

A 5th subunit appears about the time of metamorphosis to 1 st juve? nile instar, and expression of a 6th subunit begins four or five molts later. The timing of onset of adult Hc can be altered by food avail? ability and/or temperature. Experiments test? ing the potential role of magnesium concen? tration on regulation of Hc ontogeny point to non-specific stress as an additional factor in the timing of the development shift from ju? venile to adult Hc. We have identified a Hc- like protein in nauplii and juvenile Artemia using mono- and polyclonal antibodies. This may indicate simultaneous expression of both Hb and Hc gene families in the same organism. 39.2 THEOBALD, J.C.*, O'CARROLL, D, University of Washington, Seattle. Neural strategies that optimize motion detection in the crepuscular hawkmoth Manduca sexta. Perhaps the greatest demand on visual system design occurs with the transition from day to night, since illuminance can differ by a factor of 108. For an animal to function in darker conditions, its visual system must deal with an inherently enoisien image. This is a special problem for hovering hawkmoths, as the detection of low image velocities re? quired for hovering is visually demanding. We tested the hypothesis that hawkmoths use not just optical, but neural strategies to adapt their vision and motion detection to low light levels. We compared the responses of neurons in the lobula plate (a retinotopic neuropil rich in motion-sensitive cells) and photoreceptors to a moving sinusoidal stimu? lus of varying stripe density (spatial fre? quency), rate (temporal frequency), and light intensity. Our results support the hypothesis that hawkmoths use temporal neural filter? ing at low light levels, but not spatial filtering. Because the velocity of an image is the quo- tient of its temporal and spatial frequencies, low velocity information is found in both low temporal and high spatial frequencies. By sacrificing only high temporal frequency in? formation, hawkmoths improve the signal to noise ratio of a dark image, but retain the high spatial frequency information required for hovering in spatially complex habitats. 32.2 THEODOR, J.

These fea? tures have been assumed to represent an adaptation for pacing, to increase lateral sta? bility in this rolling gait. Morphometric analy? sis of 16 measurements of the metapodials and phalanges of extant camelids and ru- minants revealed distinct differences. Extant camelids have relatively longer first phalan? ges with larger, flattened distal articulations extending onto the volar surface, and the distal phalanx is short and flat, while rumi- nants have longer second phalanges with an extension of the distal facet onto the volar surface, indicating unguligrade foot posture. The sample included 18 genera of extinct camelids from the Tertiary of North America, most of which showed some morphological features typical of modern forms, and a num? ber clustered with the extant camelids. Ex? tinct members of the Camelinae and Protolabis show all of the morphological fea? tures of modern camelid foot posture, but the current phylogeny indicates they evolved these features in parallel. Independent evi? dence from trackways associated with Protolabis shows that this taxon used a pac? ing gait, indicating that these foot morpholo? gies are correlated with pacing. Evolution? ary change towards a modern camelid-like condition was also seen within the subfami? lies Stenomylinae and Miolabinae. These parallel changes in camelid locomotor anatomy occurred in the late Oligocene or early Miocene, preceding the formation of open grassland habitats in the late Miocene. 25.1 THOMAS, F.I.M., BOLTONJ.F, Univer? sity of South Florida. Mechanical forces im? posed on echinoid eggs during spawning: mitigation of force by fibrous networks within egg extracellular layers. Eggs of echinoids are exposed to me- 1232 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="309">chanical forces during spawning. The mag? nitude of these forces depends on the prop? erties of the eggs and the relative dimen? sions of the egg and gonopores. Recent evidence suggests that mechanical forces have the propensity to damage eggs, thereby reducing their fertilizability, or to de- stroy them. Jelly coats that surround echino? derm eggs have a composite structure of irregularly arranged fiberous networks em? bedded in a matrix. These fibrous networks have characteristics that are similar to engi- neered and biological materials that are known to reduce the transmission of me? chanical forces to other structures. Experi? mental evidence shows that these coats pro? tect eggs from shear stresses and reduce the strain imposed on eggs under a com? pressive force. Given the similarity of the jelly coats structure to other materials, three pos? sible mechanisms for the action of the jelly coat may be identified. First, the apparent viscosity of the eggs of echinoids declines as the rate at which they are sheared during spawning increases. This reduction in vis? cosity with increasing shear rate (shear thin- ning) may in part be due to the structure of the jelly coats and their resultant non- newtonian nature. Second, experimental evidence indicates that the jelly coat prefer- entially deforms under a compressive load reducing the transmission of that load to the egg.Thirdly, the jelly (but not the fibers in the coating) may deform in a nearly viscous manner. In this case, the fibers may serve to provide an elastic "backbone" to the layer, and remain in place to stiffen the outer layer of the egg. The composite structure of the jelly coat and the morphology of the fibrous network are likely to be critical to all these mechanisms. S13.B THOMAS, FIM University of South FLorida. Incorporation of an educational componant into a research program: trials and successes. The CAREER program at NSF provides grants for researchers early in their careers. In addition to a research program, these re? searchers are asked to develop programs designed to integrate their research with an educational component. I was a recipient of a CAREER award and subsequent PECASE award in 1997. The research com? ponent of this grant is to examine the effects of water velocity and community topogra? phy on transport and uptake of dissolved nutrients. We are using engineering mod? els, combined with field data to determine the factors that control nutrient uptake by en? tire communities. We are also using stable isotopes to examine which members of the community are involved in uptake. The edu? cation component of the program includes minority recruitment, high school and com? munity outreach programs. Developing these educational programs has added a challenge to my early career development, but in general has been an addition to my research and to my entire laboratory. The most successful and productive portion of the educational program has been the mi? nority recruitment program. Each summer 1 - 2 undergraduates come to my laboratory and participate in a research program. This program has been run in cooperation with Tuskeegee University, Talladega College, and Florida A &amp; M University. A total of six students have participated in the program over the last 3 years. The program is now focused on developing continuing research collaboration with a laboratory at FAMU so that the research experience can continue throughout the academic year. The high school and community outreach program has evolved through time. At present we are working with a high school physics teacher to develop a web based curriculum for high school students that will also be accessible for community outreach.

Many of the most commonly cited ex? amples of exquisite adaptation are of co? evolved symbioses. As we learn more about the coevolutionary process, however, it is becoming increasingly evident that coevo? lution may also keep populations moderately 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

As a result, coevolving populations may only rarely oc- cupy adaptive peaks, because the selective landscape is under continual change through reciprocal selection on the species themselves. These shifting patterns of co? adaptation are further shaped by the geo? graphic structure of most species. Selection mosaics across landscapes and coevolu- tionary hotspots can favor different evolu? tionary trajectories in different populations. The combined action of gene flow, random genetic drift, and local extinction of popula? tions may then continually remold these lo? cal patterns, creating a geographic mosaic in the degrees of maladaptation found within local interactions. Recent mathematical models of the geographic mosaic of coevo? lution suggest that complex mosaics of mal? adaptation are a likely consequence of spa? tially structured species interactions. These models indicate that the spatial structure of maladaptation may depend upon the type of coevolutionary interaction and the under? lying selection mosaic. By maintaining local polymorphisms and driving the divergence of populations, coevolution may produce spatial patterns of maladaptation that are a source of ongoing innovation and diversifi? cation in species interactions. 58.3 THOMPSON, J. T, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The ontogeny of squid mantle structure and function. The mantle of cephalopod molluscs is composed of a complicated arrangement of several different muscle and connective tis? sue components. Much is known about mantle structure and function in adult squid. However, significant alterations in mantle or? ganization occur during ontogeny that may entail significant changes in mantle function. To understand the functional implications of ontogenetic changes in mantle morphology, I studied mantle connective tissue arrange? ment and mantle kinematics in Oval Squid, Sepioteuthis lessoniana. In the mantle, the fiber angle of collagen fibers in intramuscu? lar fiber system (IM) 1 and IM-2 was lowest in hatchling squid and increased exponen- tially during growth in squid up to 15mm dorsal mantle length (DML). In squid larger than 15mm DML, IM-1 and IM-2 fiber angles did not change significantly. A simple model of mantle function based on IM collagen fi? ber arrangement predicts that the amplitude of mantle movement during jet locomotion will be highest in hatchling squid and will decline with growth. Video records of es? cape jet behavior in tethered S. lessoniana supported the ontogenetic change in mantle kinematics predicted by the model. During the escape jet, mantle hyperinflation and mantle contraction were greatest in newly hatched animals and decreased exponen- tially during growth in squid up to 15mm DML. Mantle hyperinflation and contraction did not change significantly in squid larger than 15mm DML.h 28.2 THOMPSON,E.N.*, BIK-NEVICIUS, A.R., Ohio University, Athens. A biomechani? cal analysis of the development of the mas- ticatory apparatus of Monodelphis domestica. While several studies have found differ? ences in the craniofacial configurations of juvenile and adult mammals, how these dif? ferences affect masticatory process has been poorly explored. The present study evalu- ates the masticatory apparatus in an onto? genetic series of short-tailed opossums (Monodelphis domestica) using a biome? chanical model of the jaw developed by Greaves'(1978. J. Zool. Lond. 184:295). Lon? gitudinal data on skull and upper jaw pa? rameters were obtained using radiographs. Results suggest that the occlusal area rep- resenting maximal bite force production (Re? gion II) is limited in juveniles and increases into adulthood. This increase appears to be associated not only with posterior molar erup- tion but with changes in the configuration of the entire skull as well.

Osmoregulatory capabilties were mea? sured in five species of fiddler crabs from eight coastal locations in Texas. Specimens were placed in finger bowls containing 50 mls of water ranging in osmolarity from 50 to 3450 mOsm (2 to 110 ppt). Survivorship was recorded for each species. After 3 to 5 days 1234 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="311">of exposure, the osmolarity of a hemolymph sample was estimated using a Wescor 5520 Vapor Pressure Osmometer. Uca rapax and U. panacea were most hardy over a wide range of media osmolarities. Uca spinicarpa were limited to surviving in media below 1400 mOsm (45ppt). Uca subcylindrica and U. longisignalis were intermediate in sur? vival. U. panacea, U. sub-cylindrica and U. rapax were equivalent in their osmoregula? tion between 50(2ppt) and 3200 mOsm (100ppt). U longisignalis lost it's ability to regulate above 2200 mOsm (70ppt) while U. spinicarpa ceased to regulate above 1200 mOsm (40ppt). Among the five species, only U. longisignalis exhibited a variance in regu? lation related to site of collection. These physiological capabilities correlate with the salinity characteristics of the habitats typi? cally occupied by each species. 70.5 TILDEN, A.R.*, SCHWARTZ, J., MCGANN, L, Colby College. Influence of melatonin on hemolymph metabolites in the fiddler crab Uca pugilator. Melatonin levels were measured in the eyestalks of fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator) acclimated to a LD 12:12 photoperiod, con? stant dark, and constant light. Melatonin cycled with a photophase peak during the LD 12:12 photoperiod. The cycle persisted in constant dark and constant light, with sig? nificantly greater melatonin production in constant light. These results are contrary to the scotophase melatonin peaks observed in most other organisms but may reflect a general crustacean phenomenon. We also studied the influence of melatonin on hemolymph glucose and lactate levels in fid? dler crabs. Crabs were acclimated to a LD 12:12 photoperiod and were injected with melatonin at the onset of light. Hemolymph samples were taken every three hours over 24 hr, and glucose and lactate were mea? sured simultaneously with enzymatic assays. In intact crabs, glucose and lactate levels cycled, with peaks in both occurring during early and late photophase. Melatonin shifted both glucose and lactate cycles, with one peak occurring closer to mid-photophase. Glucose did not cycle in eyestalk-ablated crabs, and overall lactate levels were lower than in intact crabs. Melatonin injection caused a delayed hyperglycemic response in eyestalk-ablated crabs with a less pro? nounced but similar effect on lactate levels. Melatonin may be involved in the synchro- nization of hemolymph metabolite levels with activity patterns, an influence that may not involve eyestalk factors.

Scaling of takeoff me? chanics in doves (Columbidae). Takeoff ability is considered to be of cen? tral importance to the ecology and evolution of animal flight, yet few studies have exam? ined the magnitude and timing of ground reaction forces during takeoff in flying birds. Predictions of takeoff ability suggest that: 1) peak accelerations during maximum take? off should scale negatively with increasing body mass and 2) initial air velocity is inde? pendent of body mass. To test these predic? tions, we studied takeoff mechanics in three species of doves (Columbidae) that varied in body mass from 40 to 492 g. The birds initiated flight while standing on a force plate that enabled measurement of vertical and horizontal ground reaction forces. After take? off, the birds ascended nearly vertically and landed on a perch 2 m above the force plate. Force recordings were sampled at 500 Hz; simultaneous high-speed video (250 Hz) was obtained for analysis of wing and body kinematics. Among the three species, the legs contributed proportionally more than the wings to flight velocity at the start of the sec? ond downstroke. Peak acceleration de? creased proportional to the -0.08 power of body mass while takeoff velocity scaled pro? portional to mass to the 0.11 power. These results support prediction 1 but not predic? tion 2. Similar scaling patterns are reported for jump performance in terrestrial animals. Average takeoff speed among dove species ranged from 2.0 to 2.7 m/s, which highlights that at no point during takeoff were the wings used at 0 m/s, the speed at which the power cost for flapping flight is highest.

Heat- shock protein (hsp) 70 and promoter se? quences in species of the genus Tegula from widely differing thermal environments. Marine gastropod species of the genus Tegula occupy widely differing thermal en? vironments along the transition from the sub- to the intertidal zone. Corresponding with these differences in vertical zonation are find? ings that the mid-intertidal T funebralis shows a higher thermotolerance as well as a higher induction and upper temperature of hsp syn? thesis, following acclimation to a common temperature than do the two subtidal spe? cies, T brunnea and T montereyi. In addi? tion, in nature T funebralis experiences tem? peratures that induce the stress response more frequently than the two subtidal spe? cies, which suggests that it activates the stress response more frequently under in vivo conditions. Previous research has also shown that T funebralis activates the stress response and recovers much faster from a stress-inducing temperature exposure typi? cal for the mid-intertidal than the subtidal T. brunnea. To investigate the molecular mechanisms that underlie these differences in stress response activation we sequenced the promoter region and the complete cyto? solic hsp70 mRNA of T. funebralis. The pro? moter region contains a heat-shock element (HSE), which is a binding region for the heat- shock factor. By binding to the HSE, heat- shock factor activates transcription of hsp genes. A comparison of 65% of the hsp70 gene among all three congeners shows three non-synonymous changes in amino acid primary structure in the far C-terminal region only. This region may be important in the conversion of active hsp70 monomers into inactive oligomers following a stress re? sponse. We are currently elucidating the remaining hsp70 and promoter sequences for T brunnea and T montereyi. P3ASTOSTE, A.M.*, BAUER, DK, TSUKIMURA, B., California State Univeersity, Fresno. Reproductive properties of the Chi? nese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis. The Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis, invaded Central California's wa- terways and expanded into the San Joaquin water system. Our focus is to study their re- productive capacity. We first investigated a portion of their reproductive cycle and found ovarian weights doubled from September (6.010.4g) to October (11.310.42g), then remained constant from October through February. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) doubled from 410.27% to 810.25% during the same time. We isolated and character? ized the yolk protein, vitellin (Vn). Using FPLC, the molecular mass (MM) of Vn was 618 kDa. SDS-PAGE revealed Vn is com? posed of four subunits 12911.8 kDa, 1151 2.5 kDa, 10511.5 kDa, and 9511.7 kDa in MM. Digestion with PNGase-F reduced these subunits into three subunits, 11913.6, 10212.5, and 9513.0 kDa indicating N- linked glycosylation ofthe two larger Vn sub? units. NANase II and O-Glycosidase DS showed no quantifiable effect. Anti-Vn antis? era was developed against native Vn. West? ern blots were used to demonstrate antisera specificity. ELISA's, using a 1:14000 antis? era dilution and having an effective range of 1- 300 ng, were developed to measure hemolymph concentrations of yolk proteins and to compare hemolymph concentrations with the GSI.

If CRABinfo can be funded and implemented, genomic DNA and cDNA sequences from crustacean species will be collected in a publicly accessible database, with links to GenBank and other generalized databases. The entries will be annotated by a curator, adding such information as bibliographic records, multiple alignments, and links to homologous sequences. Links will be in? cluded to laboratories and individuals par- ticipating in constructing the database. One of the potentially most useful applications of 1236 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ?

Altitudi- nal variation in effects of hibernation and feeding on nutrient uptake in chuckwallas (Sauromalus obesus: Iguanidae). We examined the effects of hibernation and fasting on intestinal glucose and pro? line uptake rates of chuckwallas. These liz? ards show dramatic geographic variation in body size and growth rate that parallels an altitudinal gradient in our study area. At low altitude, food is available only for a short time during the spring; at high altitude, food may also be available during summer and au? tumn, depending on rainfall conditions in a given year. We hypothesized that low-alti- tude lizards with a short season of food avail? ability would show more pronounced regu? lation of gut size and function than high-alti- tude lizards with prolonged or bimodal food availability. Hibernating lizards from both areas had significantly lower uptake rates per milligram intestine for both nutrients, and they had lower small intestine mass than active lizards. This results in significantly lower total nutrient uptake in hibernating animals compared to active ones. Lizards from low altitudes with a short growing sea? son also showed a greater increase in both uptake rates and small intestine mass when active versus when hibernating, compared to those from high altitudes with longer grow? ing seasons. Thus, compared to those from long season areas, lizards from short sea? son areas have eaual uDtake caoacitv dur- ing hibernation, but much higher uptake ca? pacity while active and feeding. This pattern of regulation of gut function may be an adap? tive response. In areas with a short season, those lizards which can extract nutrients quickly and then reduce the expensive gut will be favored; in areas where food may be available later in the year, those lizards that maintain a relatively active gut would be fa? vored. 20.1 TRAPIDO-ROSENTHAL, H.G.*, ZENGLER, K, RITTER, J.E., Bermuda Bio? logical Station for Research, Diversa Cor? poration, Diversa Corporation. Multiple spe? cies of archaea, cyanobacteria, and eubacteria live in association with the sponge Chondrilla nucula. Marine sponges have been the subjects of natural products chemists' investigations for many years, and have been the sources from which novel chemicals with interesting properties have been isolated. Many marine sponges harbor large populations of symbi? otic bacteria, an observation which has led to the thought that these bacteria may be the organisms responsible for a significant frac? tion of the interesting chemicals that have been found in sponge homogenates. At? tempts to culture these symbionts prior to further taxonomic and chemical studies have not always been successful. We are investi- gating the biodiversity of bacterial popula? tions that live in association with sponges using techniques that allow us to bypass the culturing step. The sponge Chondrilla nucula was collected from shallow depths in Harrington Sound, frozen at n70 /C, and then mechanically homogenized in five vol? umes of sterile, calcium- and magnesium- free artificial seawater (ASW). The homogenates were subjected to multiple rounds of centrifugation on Percoll/ASW gra? dients (15% v/v). The resulting bands of cells were collected, the cells were lysed, and the 16S ribosomal RNA genes present in the lysate were amplified by means of PCR, using primer sets designed to identify these genes from eubacteria, cyanobacteria, and archaea. The amplification products were cloned, and their sequences determined and compared to 16S sequences in GenBank. The results indicate that 15 species of 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Antifreeze glycopro? teins (AFGPs) are secreted into the diges? tive tract from the pancreas in Antarctic notothenioid fishes. Pancreatic tissues in teleost fishes are diffuse unlike other vertebrates. In the large Antarctic notothenioid fish Dissostichus mawsoni a small reservoir exists at the ter- minus of the pancreatic tissue duct system in the tissue surrounding the common bile duct. Freezing-melting point (i.e. antifreeze activity) analyses of pancreatic fluid samples (0.2 ml to 1.0 ml) from this reservoir indicate the presence of high levels of antifreeze pro? tein. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified antifreeze from pancreatic fluid shows the presence of the same eight sizes of antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) found in the blood except the large AFGPs 1-5 occur in much lower abundance. The intes? tinal fluid has a similar AFGP profile as the pancreatic fluid, indicating the intestinal AFGPs came from the pancreatic fluid. The antifreeze activity of the intestinal fluid is higher than that of the pancreatic, indicating that the AFGP concentrations in intestinal fluids are higher than in the pancreatic flu? ids. Since AFGPs in the intestinal fluid ap? pear to be neither digested nor reabsorbed, the higher AFGP levels in the intestinal fluid are likely due to concentration of AFGPs as digested food and water are absorbed. 18.4 TROWBRIDGE, CD* HIRANO, Y.J., Oregon State University, Newport, Chiba University, Kominato, Japan. Marine special? ist herbivores on high-diversity shores: eco? logical notes of Japanese ascoglossan (= Sacoglossan) opisthobranchs. Most marine specialist herbivores belong to the molluscan order Ascoglossa, a group of suctorial sea slugs that show intriguing parallels with phytophagous insects. We in? vestigated the ecology of ascoglossans in a region of high species richness: the temper? ate rocky shores of Sagami Bay, NE Japan. The wealth of taxonomic descriptions about Japanese sea slugs contrasts with the mea- ger ecological information. Based at Misaki Marine Biological Station (University Tokyo), we investigated three ascoglossan assem? blages: (1) Placida dendritica, Elysia trisinuata, and Elysia setoensis on Codium spp., (2) Ercolania boodleae, Aplysiopsis minor, and Elysia nigrocapitata in high inter? tidal pools associated with filamentous green algae, and (3) Stiliger berghiassociated with polysiphonous red algae. The small (&lt;15 mg) Placida dendritica was most abundant on subtidal C fragile whereas the large (&lt;800 mg) Elysia trisinuatawas most frequent on the encrusting C. arabicum. The pool- dwelling Ercolania boodleae formed high- density populations of small animals (&lt;10 mg) whereas the other two sympatric spe? cies were sparsely distributed and consid? erably larger. Finally, the very small (&lt;4 mg) Stiliger berghi occurred on red algae epi- phytic on subtidal Codium. The feeding specificity of the Cod/i/Arj-associated slugs was partially elucidated: recent feeding his? tory of the slugs and age and physiological condition of the algae influenced slugs' host- plant choice. Given the high species rich? ness of ascoglossans on NW Pacific shores, interspecific interactions may influence co? existence among these sympatric species. Additional ecological study of these species is clearly merited. 70.6 TSAI, P.-S. *, MALDONADO, T.A, PAK, T.R., ZHANG, L, University of Colorado, Boulder, University of Colorado, Boulder, University of Colorado, Boulder, University of Connecticut, Storrs. Characterization of a Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone System in an opisthobranch mollusk, Aplysia californica. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a neurohormone crucial for the regulation of reproductive and neural func? tions in vertebrates. Recent discoveries of GnRH immunoreactivity (IR) in a num? ber of invertebrates raised the possibility that GnRH may be an ancient molecule that had arisen before the emergence of Phylum Chordata. We previously demon- 1238 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="315">strated the presence of a GnRH-IR similar to the mammalian (m) and tunicate I (tl) forms of GnRH in the hemolymph and ovotestis of an opisthobranch mollusk, Aplysia californica; however, the presence of GnRH in Aplysia central nervous sys? tem (CNS) could not be detected with the available antisera against various forms of chordate GnRH. In the present study, we generated an antiserum against a syn- thetic tl-GnRH analogue (97575). This antiserum cross-reacted strongly with na? tive tl-GnRH and also detected GnRH-IR in extracts of ovotestis and hemolymph. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that this antiserum detected strong GnRH- IR in defined neurons of Aplysia CNS, with the greatest number of GnRH-IR neurons present in pedal and pleural ganglia. In summary, we have identified a GnRH-IR very similar to tl-GnRH in the CNS, hemolymph and ovotestis of Aplysia californica. In view of our previous finding that vertebrate GnRH can alter the electri? cal activity of Aplysia neurons, the possi? bility exists that this GnRH-IR may be a factor released from the CNS and ovotes? tis into circulation to alter neural functions.

Polyclonal antisera against estuarine crustacean vitellins: a molecu? lar approach to reproductive endocrinol? ogy and toxicology. In order to fully elucidate the action of crustacean hormones, or their agonists, on reproduction and vitellogenesis it has become increasingly important to develop sensitive assays that indicate a stimula? tory or inhibitory effect on easily measured endpoints. Because of the relative abun? dance of vitellin in crustacean yolk and the ease with which it can be isolated, vi? tellin makes an excellent model for study? ing the mechanisms that control and regu- late reproduction. With this in mind, adult female Lepidophthalmus louisianensis, Palaemonetes pugio, Rhithropanopeus harrisii, Americamysis (Mysidopsis) bahia, and Uca panacea were collected from es? tuarine localities in Santa Rosa Sound, Gulf Breeze, Florida during late spring and summer of 1999. Vitellin was purified from each crustacean and used to immunize rabbits for polyclonal antibody production. Specificity of each antisera was tested against their respective vitellins by West? ern blotting. The antisera will be used to develop enzyme-linked im-munosorbent assays for determination of hemolymph vitellogenin and egg vitellin concentra? tions. These assays could be used to de? termine effects of endogenous hormones on the rate or onset of vitellogenesis. In addition, these assays would be valuable tools in determining the effects of insect juvenile hormone agonists on reproduc? tion and egg maturation. S7A3TURBEVILLE, J. M., University of Ar? kansas. Recent progress in Nemertean bi? ology: phylogeny, development, ecology. Phylum Nemertea contains approxi? mately 1000 species of unsegmented worms that possess an eversible proboscis. The phylum has a global distribution and in? cludes marine, freshwater and terrestrial species. Although relatively common, nem? erteans have been understudied. However, in recent years significant advances in nem? ertean biology have been made and contri? butions to three areas will be reviewed: 1) phylogeny, 2) development and 3) ecology. Nemerteans are generally considered to be primitive acoelomate bilaterians most closely related to platyhelminths, and their HOX genes recently have been examined to gain insight into the evolution of these regulatory genes in Bilateria. Nevertheless, their phy? logenetic position remains uncertain. One recent cladistic analysis of morphological characters places nemerteans in a spiralian coelomate clade, whereas another supports a Nemertea + Platyhelminthes clade. These conflicting phylogenies result from different a priori interpretations of nemertean body cavities and other morphological features. Analyses of 18S rDNA sequences suggest 800-955-1236 ?

Biotic and abiotic factors associated with mortality during this critical period have been identified, but the causal link between these factors and mor? tality is not clearly understood. This study explores the link between development of the feeding mechanism and prey-capture performance in larval red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus). Lower-jaw depression in red drum larvae developed from a simple mechanism around first-feeding, driven by the hyoid-mandible linkage (i.e., the hyoid stage), to a more complex mechanism around metamorphosis, driven by the hy? oid- and opercular series-mandible linkages (i.e., the hyoid-opercular stage). This two- stage development of the feeding mecha? nism was associated with differences in feed? ing performance: (1) less than 50% of larvae fed during the hyoid stage whereas almost all larvae at the hyoid-opercular stage con? sumed prey; and (2) first-feeding larvae pre? ferred small and less elusive prey relative to conspecifics at metamorphosis, which pre? ferred larger and more elusive prey. Our ability to understand the functional relation? ship between development of the feeding mechanism and prey-capture performance enhances our ability to understand the un? derlying causes of mortality in larval fishes.

Two molecular species previously iden? tified as electrophoretic bands at 66 and 79 kD in extracts from dorsal carpace cuticle disappear within a few hours after the molt in the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. Dis? appearance of these bands occurs coinci- dentally with the onset of initial mineral depo? sition in the new cuticle exposed by molting. Identified as heavily glycosylated, mucin-like proteins, these two molecular species have been purified to homogeneity by jacalin lec? tin affinity and gel filtration chromatography columns and SDS-PAGE. The species con? tain both N- and O-glycosidic linkages, as indicated by PNGase electrophoretic band shifts, as well as affinity for jacalin and con- canavalin A lectins. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified glycoproteins were used in Western blot and immunohis- tochemical analyses of early postmolt cu? ticle. Western blots revealed similar post? ecdysial cuticle alteration (PECA) changes as those recorded in previous research; namely, a dramatic electrophoretic band shift at one to two hours postmolt. Although anti? bodies demonstrated an affinity for epicu? ticular material in fluorescence-assisted his? tochemistry, they were not specific enough to distinguish or localize the mucin-like pro? teins in cuticle sections. Amino acid se? quencing is being undertaken in order to raise more specific antibodies against epitopes in the core polypeptide. P1.5 TYLER, S.*, HOOGEM.D, University of Maine, Orono.

The musculature is unlike that of other soft- bodied meiofaunal phyla, being dominated by longitudinal fibers that run the full length of the body and having circular fibers only in the posterior half of the body. Conceivably, the strong circular muscles may be used to push the anterior body half through restrict- ing pores, and the longitudinal elements may then pull the rest of the body through.

P2.64A rVTELL E.D, ELLINGTON, CP, Department of Zoology, University of Cam? bridge. The vortex wake of the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta: simulation and Reynolds number effects. The vortex wake structure of the hawk? moth, Manduca sexta, was investigated us? ing a vortex ring generator. Based on exist? ing kinematic and morphological data, a pis- ton and tube apparatus was constructed to produce circular vortex rings with the same size and disc loading as a hovering hawk? moth. The artificial rings were shown to be qualitatively similar to the vortex wake of actual hawkmoths. They were initially lami? nar, but developed an azimuthal wave in- stability and became turbulent. The initial impulse and circulation was accurately esti? mated for laminar rings using particle imag? ing velocimetry (PIV); after the transition to turbulence, though, initial circulation was generally underestimated. The underesti- mate for turbulent rings can be corrected if transition time and velocity profile are accu? rately known, but this correction will not be feasible for experiments on real animals. It is therefore crucial that the circulation and impulse are estimated while the wake vorti- ces are still laminar. Based on the scaling of ring Reynolds number, hawkmoths and ani? mals with similar wingspan and wing beat frequency are probably the largest for which the laminar period lasts long enough during hovering. Thus, at low advance ratios, they may be largest animals for which wake cir? culation and impulse can be accurately measured. S13.8 UDOVIC, D, University of Oregon. Rethinking introductory biology: the work? shop biology project as a case study in cur- ricular reform. Workshop Biology is one of many experi? mental approaches to teaching introductory college-level science that emerged during the 1990's. The goal of this non-majors' course is to engage students in open-ended, interactive activities and projects designed to develop (1) studentsi understanding of essential biological concepts, (2) their un? derstanding of the process of scientific dis? covery, and (3) their critical thinking skills. Overall, our desire is to improve students' abilities to make good decisions about im? portant personal and societai issues by fos- tering their ability to bring scientific knowl? edge and ways of thinking to bear on prob? lems whenever relevant. In this talk I will de? scribe the Workshop Biology philosophy, il? lustrate our approach, and discuss current evidence that this approach and others like it are effective in achieving their goals. 23.2 USHERWOOD, J. R., Florida State University, Tallahassee. Aerodynamics and energetics of animal flight based on propel- ler models. Recent work on flapping insect models has demonstrated the importance of a spiral 'leading-edge vortex' created by dynamic stall and maintained by some aspect of spanwise flow, for creating the lift required during flight (Ellington et al., 1996; Dickinson et al., 1999). This study uses propeller mod? els to investigate further the forces acting on model and real animal wings in 'propeller- like' rotation ('revolution').The effects of cam- ber, twist, and leading-edge characteristics are shown to be minor for model Manduca wings. Force coefficients are derived for wings of animals ranging from mayfly to quail. Some aspect of the aerodynamics of animal wings in revolution, presumably the leading-edge vortex, results in high lift and drag forces, and appears to be a robust phe? nomenon.

New observations on the asexual reproduction of Aurelia aurita (cnidaria, scyphozoa) with comments on its daptative significance. A new reproductive mechanism has been observed in scyphistomae of Aurelia aurita. It is termed gemmation and it is referred to as an asexual mode of reproduction in which scyphistomae produce small and mostly spherical masses of cells called gemmae. These structures are generated internally by extrusion of the body wall tissue. In contrast to the budding process, gemmation pro? duces ramets that do not develop adult scy- phistoma morphology prior to their release, and they only do so after passing through a free-swimming period that lasts several weeks. In addition, a new budding process in A. aurita is reported. It is characterized by the external production of free-swimming buds, which also pass through a planktonic stage before settlement and metamorpho? sis occurs. A description of A. aurita life cycle is presented, including comments on its various modes of asexual reproduction, larval development, and their adaptative significance. 57.1 VALVERDE, R.A.*, DENVER, R.J., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Molecu? lar evolution of the corticotropin-releasing hormone binding protein Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is the primary neuroendocrine mediator of the stress response in vertebrates. CRH is known to regulate appetite, locomotion, re? productive processes, and development, either by acting within the central nervous system or by functioning as a hypophysiotropin, regulating the production of adrenal steroids and thyroid hormone. A high affinity, specific CRH binding protein (CRHBP) has been identified in several mammalian species and in the amphibian Xenopus laevis. The protein exhibits exten? sive structural and functional conservation among the taxa studied to date. The CRHBP is thought to regulate the bioavailability of CRH by competing for binding with CRH re? ceptors. Using a crosslinking, competitive binding assay we report the detection of the CRHBP in the brain of an agnathan fish the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), a teleost fish, the tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), a chelonian reptile, the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta), and a bird, the chicken (Gallus domesticus). The CRHBP in these taxa reversibly binds [125l]-Xenopus CRH as does the frog binding protein. In an effort to understand the molecular evolution of this key neuroendocrine regulatory protein we are currently cloning and sequencing CRHBP cDNAs from several vertebrates. Our current data show that the CRHBP is a phy? logenetically ancient protein and suggest that the regulatory role of CRHBP for the CRH peptide arose early in animal evolution.(Supported by NSF grant IBN9974672 to RJD; RAV was supported by a NIH training grant administered by the Center for Organogenesis, University of Michigan) 16.5 VAN CLEEFF, J.*, BLACHE, D, MARTIN, G., University of Western Aus? tralia. Early castration of male emus (dromaius novaehollandiae) reduces their feed efficiency and attenuates vernal fat? tening without impairing appetite. The emu responds to increasing photo? period with an increase in appetite and fat deposition. This response is normally de? layed until breeding season hormones, stimulated by short days, have been cleared from the system, about 6 weeks after the Winter Solstice in the case of non-incubat- ing males. We investigated the interactions between testosterone, feed intake and ver? nal fatttening in male emus fed ad libitum and maintained outdoors in a Mediterra? nean type environment (Perth, Australia). Emus castrated as 8-week-old chicks grew normally but in adulthood failed to undergo vernal fattening to the same extent as intact 1242 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Maximum summer weight was 43.1 11.4 kg for Cas? trated emus, and 49.2 1 1.6 kg for Intact emus. In Winter, Castrated emus lost 9% from the maximum live weight of the previous summer, compared to 18% for Intact emus. Annual feed intake was similar between In? tact and Castrated emus, but intake was high? est in Winter for Castrated emus and high? est in Spring for Intact emus. Castrated emus can respond to increasing photoperiod very soon after the Winter Solstice with increased intake and fat deposition, but their ability to deposit fat is severely impaired. Testoster? one appears to be necessary for normal feed efficiency and conversion of consumed feed to fat deposits in Spring and Summer in the emu. 33.6 VAN VOORHIES, W A, New Mexico State University. Broad oxygen tolerance in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. I studied the effects of oxygen tensions ranging from 0 to 90 kPa on the metabolism, movement, and survivorship in the free-liv? ing, soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans requires oxygen to develop and survive. However, it can maintain a normal metabolic rate at oxygen levels of 3.6 kPa and has near normal metabolic levels at oxygen levels as low as 2 kPa. The ability to withstand low ambient oxygen levels ap? pears to be a consequence of the small body size of C. elegans which allows diffusion to readily supply oxygen to cells without re- quiring any specialized respiratory or meta? bolic adaptations. Thus, the small size of this organism pre-adapts C elegans to living in soil environments that commonly become hypoxic. Movement in C elegans appears to be of relatively minor metabolic cost. Dif? ferent developmental stages of C. elegans are able to withstand up to 24 hrs of anoxia without major mortality. Longer periods sig? nificantly increased mortality, particularly for eggs. Remarkably, long-term exposure to 100% oxygen had no effect on C. elegans metabolic rate and populations were able to survive for a least 50 generations in 100% (90 kPa) oxygen. Such hyperoxic conditions are fatal to most organisms within a short period. P3.30 VAN WINKLE, DH.*, BLACKSTONE, N.W., Northern Illinois University Ontoge? netic changes in competitive behavior &amp; ability in colonial hydroids. In controlled laboratory experiments, colo? nies of Podocoryna carnea (PC) typically overgrow and kill colonies of Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus (HS). Generally, these experiments have used colonies grown from tissue explants surgically removed from mature colonies taken from natural popula? tions. Recent experiments comparing inter? specific bouts among juveniles and those among explants taken from mature colonies reveal that both the behavioral characteris? tics and outcomes of competition are signifi? cantly different. Among juveniles, HS colo? nies exhibit directional growth toward PC and more readily produce nematocyte-rich hyperplastic stolons than PC. Nevertheless, PC can still overcome HS if it initially grows away from the contact zone and subse- quently outgrows HS. Overall, HS juveniles destroyed their PC counterparts in more than 35% of competitive bouts on limited sub? strata, while mature PC colonies dominated their HS counterparts in all similar encoun? ters. In the field, both species occur on gas? tropod shells inhabited by hermit crabs. On these shells, competition among young colo? nies is a common phenomenon. The same factors that lead to differential larval settle? ment over the shell surface likely also lead to food gradients. The directional growth po? tential of juvenile HS colonies leading to the occupation and defense of these nutrient- rich zones may thus provide a significant advantage owing to increased growth rates in early ontogeny. The recently observed be? havior and relative success of competing juvenile HS colonies may in part explain the considerably greater abundance of this spe? cies in natural habitats relative to PC.

The kinematic redundancy is resolved by movement principles, e.g., Fowl move their necks according to a geometric prin? ciple that maximizes rotation efficiency. The movement pattern shows large rotations in some joints, while keeping the other verte? brae more or less as straight bars. Water? fowl show a pattern of successive, rather than simultaneous rotations, in the rostral part of the neck. A kinematic model shows that the geometric principle only produces a Water- fowl-like pattern if a constraint on the move? ment of the caudal vertebrae is introduced. The constraint is related to the amount of stretch in the long dorsal neck muscles, which have a different configuration in Wa? terfowl. To investigate whether the difference in movement pattern result from differences in either anatomy or neuromotor patterns, the EMG of neck muscles was compared between Mallard and Chicken for drinking, pecking and inertial feeding. The results show large differences: 1. In mallards, con? siderable overlap is found in the activity of antagonist, but not in chickens. 2. Dorsal muscles in the rostral part of the neck are activated successively in mallards, rather than simultaneously as in chickens. 3. In mal? lards, ventral and dorsal muscles are active during the backward and forward movement of inertial feeding respectively, but the re? verse is found in chickens. We conclude that the difference in movement patterning be? tween Chicken and Mallard results from a difference in the control system of the neck, which may have evolved as an adaptation to aquatic feeding in Waterfowl, but is also evident in various movements above the water surface and on land. 48.4 VANHOOYDONCK,B.*,VANDAMME, R., AERTS, R, University of Antwerp (UI.A), Belgium. Trade-offs in the evolution of loco? motor performance: are speed and stamina correlated in lacertid lizards? Morphological and physiological consid? erations suggest that sprinting ability and endurance capacity put conflicting demands on the design of an animal's locomotor ap? paratus, and therefore cannot be optimised simultaneously. To test this hypothesis, we correlated size-corrected maximal sprint speed and stamina of 12 species of lacertid lizards. Both raw species means and phylo? genetically independent contrasts of sprint speed and stamina showed a significant negative relationship, giving support to the idea of an evolutionary trade-off between the two performance measures. To test the hypothesis that the trade-off is mediated by a conflict in morphological requirements, we correlated both performance traits with snout- vent length, size-corrected estimates of body mass and limb length, and relative hind limb length (the residuals of the relationship be? tween hind and fore limb length). Fast run? ning species had hind limbs that were long compared to their fore limbs. None of the other size and shape variables showed a significant relationship with speed or endur? ance. We conclude that the evolution of sprint capacity may be constrained by the need for endurance capacity and vice versa, but iden? tification of the design conflict underlying this trade-off is needed to close the case. P2MVATNICK, L*, GRANT, B., Widener University. Principles of design for a re- search-centered biology curriculum. In the last decade, undergraduate sci? ence education has undergone a quiet revolution emphasizing opportunities for student-directed original inquiry as the curriculum. Opportunities to conduct genu- ine investigations are important because they teach students how science is actu? ally done and thereby they learn by doing it. However, entering students lack suffi? cient confidence, organizational skills, and content background for open-ended stu? dent-directed investigations as freshmen. Our solution is to design a program that incrementally introduces more open- ended inquiries. The initial task in the lad? der is to infuse research inquiry experi? ences in the laboratory portions of our freshmen and sophomore required courses that will at least enable students to understand the process of knowledge construction. In addition we hope that these experiences will stimulate students to become involved in substantive re- 1244 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Development is the vehicle by which genetic and environmental inputs affect morphology and is critical for accurate in? terpretation of the evolution of Coccinellid color pattern. Ladybug spots are of par? ticular interest because the genetics and the distributions of melanic and non-mela- nic forms are well charactarized yet the existing variation is not fully explained. In addition, many of the selective forces which act on spotting pattern have been identified. To date, studies have focused on the differences among morphs in poly? morphic species, with little to no attention paid to sources of variation within a morph or in monomorphic species. Adult Harmo- nia axyridis, an extremely polymorphic species, and Epilachna varivestis, a mono? morphic species were reared at three tem? peratures and their spots measured to de? termine the degree of phenotypic plasiticy in expression of spots. Both species showed significant levels of plasticity and a sexual dimorphism in spot expression. 10.3 VEZINA, F.*, SALVANTE, KG., WILL? IAMS, T.D., Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C. Canada, The metabolic cost of yolk pre? cursor production. The metabolic cost of egg production in birds is poorly understood. Previous re? sults with European Starlings (Sturnus vul? garis) suggested that physiological adjust? ments, namely production of the yolk pre? cursors, vitellogenin (VTG) and yolk-tar- geted very-low density lipoprotein (VLDLy), may be responsible for an in- crease in resting metabolic rate (RMR) during follicular development and egg pro? duction. To test this hypothesis we admin? istered 17-beta estradiol (E2) to male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to stimulate yolk precursor production in non-reproductive birds and measure its effect on RMR.The metabolic rates of sham and E2-treated birds were measured be? fore and after the E2 administration pe? riod (four daily injections). E2 administra? tion resulted in an increase in plasma VTG levels, as well as an increase in oviduct mass, but to levels lower than natural re? productive state. RMR was not affected by E2 treatment, nor were plasma levels of VLDL or ovary mass. Resting metabolic rate was not related to oviduct mass and was repeatable when comparing before and after treatment. S15.9VLECK, C*, VLECK, D, Iowa State University, Ames. Physiological condition and reproductive consequences in Adelie pen? guins. Animals must make 'decisions' (e.g. when or whether to breed, the effort to put into a breeding episode) by integrating physiologi? cal, environmental and social inputs. This integration can only be studied in a field con? text. Physiological measurements that pro? vide reliable predictors of animalsf reproduc? tive decisions will aid in identifying critical input variables and in predicting and poten? tially managing reproductive success in natural populations. Candidate measure? ments include body mass and body size, glucocorticoid titers and blood cell counts as indicators of stress, and hematological measures that estimate hydration and reli- ance of cellular metabolism on stored body fat or protein. In Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) reproduction is constrained by for? aging ecology, mode of transport, and the latitude at which they live. Females that re? turn to the colony but do not breed are 10- 12% lighter than females that do, but male nonbreeders are as heavy as male breed? ers and have similar hormone levels. Pen? guins must fast for many weeks during re? production. Nest failure often occurs when one parent does not return to the colony, 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

During normal-length fasts corticosterone levels do not change, but when fasts are very long and birds have lost &gt;35% of their body mass, corticosterone and hematocrit increase and prolactin decreases. During fasting ketone levels gradually increase while uric acid levels are low, but in birds with the longest fasts, ketone levels fall and uric acid levels increase, indicative of a switch from using fat to body proteins for me? tabolism. These physiological and endo? crine measurement help to reveal the proxi? mate mechanisms at the individual level that link environmental and population-level variation in penguin reproductive success. 69.3 VOGEL, S. Duke University Muscle as engine: a biomechanical look at some an? cient tasks. Using muscle to power large-scale tasks presents specific difficulties. For instance, the relatively uniform size of people and draft animals imposes problems of scaling, and muscle's inability to produce rotary motion means that non-functional mass must be ac- celerated and decelerated. Thus (1) the blocks used for the Egyptian pyramids may have deliberately been made large in order to minimize the surface area that had to be cut and dressedoperhaps we should focus less on how they were moved than on how the quarries could produce a well-cut stone every two minutes. The blocks were cer? tainly dwarfed by stones moved long dis? tances by less socially-elaborate cultures. (2) Oars and paddles do well for small boats, but if oar power is to scale with anything close to hull area, multiple manning of each is necessary. As a result, the masses of the oars of the great triremes and galleys, often over 100 kg each, imposed excessive iner? tial loads. A good alternative, treadmill-pow- ered paddle-wheels, saw little use outside China. (3) Ballistae, using stretched tendon as energy store, minimized non-functional moving mass but were limited in both force and power to what one or two artillerymen could generate. By contrast, medieval trebuchets, using gravitational storage, could employ large numbers of operators, but their massive arms imposed low inertial efficien- cies.

However, this ability comes with great risk. Bumblebees are unable to warm- up and fly if they cool to near freezing air temperature or if they have inadequate fuel reserves to sustain a high enough body tem? perature for flight. Bumblebees were sub? jected to prolonged exposure to cold air tem? peratures without a food source to determine some of the limits in performance (activity and flight). No discernable differences were observed between drones and workers. Bees with ample food in the crop were ca? pable of enduring several days at cool air temperatures. Larger body size may in? crease survival time at near-freezing air tem? perature. Prolonged exposure to near-freez? ing air temperature appears to suppress the ability of bees that have been stimulated to warm-up at 22C when compared to bees acclimated to warmer air temperature.

How? ever, the connection between UV induced mortality and population dynamics has not been examined explicitly. We examine the population-level consequences of UV-B in? duced egg mortality in the Common toad, Bufo bufo using a stage-structured popula? tion model that includes terms for density dependent juvenile recruitment, and juve? nile and adult survivorship. Our results sug? gest that, except for a small range of values for some parameters, the stable adult popu? lation size shows little variation under changes in the survival of the eggs. Thus, based on our model increased egg-stage mortality due to exposure to UV-B alone is unlikely to result in declining adult popula? tions for this species. The model exhibits simi? lar behavior under a wide range of param? eter values, which leads us to believe it to be an adequate analysis tool. The sensitiv? ity analysis provides information on which parameters strongly affect the stable adult population size, and this could lead to other hypothesis on the causes of the reduction of amphibian populations. S3.12 WAINWRIGHT, RC, University of Cali? fornia, Davis. The role of motor patterns in the evolution of fish feeding performance. How are fish feeding mechanisms modi? fied during evolution to produce diversity in feeding ability and feeding ecology? In par? ticular, are feeding motor patterns always altered in conjunction with biomechanical changes of muscle-skeleton linkages? Stud? ies of the evolution of fish feeding mecha? nisms have consistently yielded two very different answers to the latter question. The origin of novel trophic habits can be associ? ated with considerable modification of the motor pattern that drives feeding behavior. This occurs when the new prey type is cap? tured or processed using a new behavior or mechanism. Examples include the origin of mollusc crushing in several groups of teleo? sts, and the origin of algae scraping in parrotfishes. Alternatively, a number of in? dependent, quantitative interspecific com? parisons of the motor patterns used in prey capture by fishes have found that the aver- age value of burst duration and onset time of homologous muscles does not vary sig? nificantly across species. This is true even in some cases where the jaw mechanics, feeding performance and patterns of prey use of the species differ considerably. I sug? gest that this evolutionary conservation of motor patterns does not represent a con? straint on the malleability of the neuromus? cular system. There is abundant evidence that motor patterns can readily be altered and that they are under fine control by indi? vidual fish. Rather, conservation of a func? tional trait that is inherently quite flexible sug? gests that altering it is neither effective nor necessary for modifying feeding perfor? mance. Some trophic radiations may thus involve extensive morphological changes with consequences for linkage mechanics and prey capture kinematics, but with few concomitant changes to the motor patterns that control feeding.

Swimming in air, flying under water: physical constraints on the design of oscil? lating wings, fins, legs, and feet at interme? diate reynolds numbers. Why do some animals swim by rowing appendages back and forth while others fly by flapping them up and down? One an? swer lies in the sharply divergent physical environments encountered by small, slow animals, and large, fast animals. Flapping appendages allow large animals to move through a fluid environment quickly and effi- ciently. As size and speed decrease, how? ever, viscous drag dominates the force bal? ance. Consequently, the geometry of ap? pendage motion allows a rowing, but not flapping, appendage to exploit large skin- friction drag for thrust generation. I used both a comparative analysis and a mathematical model to address the question "At what scale does a rowing appendage work more effi- ciently than a flapping appendage?" The comparative analysis suggests that flapping flight is less effective than rowing at Re less than 50 -100. A simple quasi-steady, blade- element model of virtual oscillating append? ages has several important results. First, the mechanical efficiency of both rowing and flapping decrease dramatically with scale. 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Juveniles (ca. 14 mm diameter, n=120) were collected at St. Joseph Bay, FL in March 2000. They were held in 80 L aquaria with artificial seawater at 21 C and 32 ppt salinity. The juveniles were fed ad libitum one of four isocaloric diets varying in protein concen? tration (14,23,32 or 50%) for 14 weeks. Test diameters increased from 14 mm to 19.8, 29.4, 30.5, or 32.6 mm in individuals fed the 14,23,32, or 50 % protein diet, respectively. Total wet weights increased from 1.06 g to 4.7, 13.7, 14.4, or 16.5 g in individuals fed the 14, 23, 32, or 50 % protein diet, respec? tively. Specific growth rates were 1.7, 2.9, 2.9, or 3.1 % body wet weight increase per day. At week 14, gonad indices (wet gonad/ wet weight x 100) were 2.5,7.4,7.2 or 9.1 for the 14, 23, 32, or 50 % protein diet, respec? tively. Apparent dry matter digestibility, mea? sured on week 5 and 10, ranged from 83 to 90 % (lowest in those fed the low protein diet) and did not change over time. Survivor? ship was 100% in individuals fed the 32 or 50 % protein diet, but was reduced to 77 or 70 % in those fed the 14 or 23 % protein diet. Low concentrations of dietary protein influ? enced growth rate, gonad production, and survivorship, but had minimal influence on absorption efficiency. Gonad production oc? curred in individuals whose diameters were smaller than reported previously in field populations. The requirement for a protein diet of &gt; 23 % corroborates with ecological studies that indicate L variegatus preferen- tially consumes epibionts and animal tissues in preference to seagrasses.

Being among the first microorganisms seen by children exploring the world with their new microscope or high schoolers in biology class, rotifers have fascinated people for nearly 325 years, ever since Leeuwenhoek began describing them in his letters to the Royal Society in London late in the 17th century. And while these organ? isms have captivated the imagination of many, including writers of science fiction and artists working in glass, they are generally ignored by research biologists, for probably fewer than 350 people world-wide study ro? tifers on a regular or even irregular basis. Accordingly, rotifer research is still an open field where amateurs and professionals coming lately to the discipline can make an immediate positive impact on our knowl? edge of these curious little beasties. Pos? sessing an anterior ciliated field (corona) used in locomotion and/or food gathering and a pharynx (mastax) equipped with com? plex jaws (trophi), rotifers comprise a mod- erately-sized phylum (=1850 species) of tiny (=100-1,500 |im), bilaterally symmetrical, eutelic metazoans, traditionally grouped with the pseudocoelomates. Rotifers are saccate to cylindrical animals with three prominent regions (corona, trunk, foot) and a body cav? ity in which are suspended the internal or? gans. Unfortunately these generalizations grossly oversimplify a rich and fascinating diversity. Chief among their charms for re? search is their ease of culture (including chemostat technology) and the fact that there is much that remains unknown about the phylum. Here I review the trends in rotifer research over the past 25 years, note the directions of current work, and suggest ar? eas where future efforts may prove profit- able.

Molecular systematics of the brachionidae (phylum rotifera) based on internal transcribed spacers (its) of the nuclear ribosomal gene complex. Rotifers play important roles in freshwa? ter communities. Despite their ubiquity, little is known about their evolutionary relation? ships. From an ecological perspective brachionid rotifers have received consider? able attention yet the most basic feature of their phylogeny, the monophyly of the group, has not been investigated. We have se? quenced both ITS regions from representa- tives of 5 genera and 23 species within Brachionidae in addition to species from families Epiphanidae, Lecanidae, and Euchlanidae. Both regions contained many informative sites and each data set contained a strong phylogenetic signal as indicated by g1 values of -0.0755 (p&lt;0.01) and -0.6688 (p&lt;0.01) for ITS1 and ITS2, respectively. Data sets were analyzed individually and in com? bination using parsimony and maximum like? lihood. Support for monophyly of the Brachionidae was found in all analyses. Monophyly of genera Keratella and Notholca were also supported. The position of Plationus patulus is investigated as is the placement of genus Rhinoglena.

Because the force required to rotate a body about an axis is directly proportional to its rotation inertia about the axis, it is likely that animals with high rotational in? ertia would be constrained in their turning abilities. Using the fact that a physical pendulumfs period is proportional to its rotational inertial 12, we measured the ro? tational inertia in two groups of vertebrates with greatly different body shapes: murian rodents and lizards (Iguana iguana and Varanus exanthermaticus). A small lizard has more than double the rotational iner- tia about its center of mass as an equiva? lent size rodent. Because, in geometri? cally similar animals, rotational inertia scales with massA5/3, while muscle force scales with massA2/3, larger animals are expected to have more difficulty turning. Rotational inertia scaled nearly isometri? cally for the muiran rodents, and with slight negative alometry for the varanids and iguanas. This suggests that either these animals are not constrained by rotational inertia due to their relatively small size, or that larger rodents and lizards are poorer turners than smaller ones. The basal synapsids from which cynodonts and mammals are derived had a body mor? phology best represented by recent lizards such as varanids or iguanas. The loss of the large muscular tail and elongated body form during synapsid evolution re? duced rotational inertia and likely im? proved turning ability. 63.4 WALTERS, LJ. *, ABGRALL, M.J., Uni? versity of Central Florida, Orlando. Impact of drift species (Gracilaria compressa, Zoobotryon verticiilatum) on the recruitment and fitness of sessile invertebrates. Mosquito Lagoon is the northern-most estuary in the Indian River Lagoon system. Here, large, dislodged masses of macroalgae and the bryozoan Zoobotryon verticiilatum can be found drifting in the wa? ter at varying times throughout the year. Capture of drift in nets ranged from 0-158 g/ hr. Drift algae and masses of Zoobotryon fre? quently become entangled around sub- merged hard surfaces, and thus may signifi? cantly impact the settlement and fitness of hard-bottom sessile invertebrates. We ex? amined the impact of the common red macroalga Gracilaria compressa and the bryozoan Zoobotryon on the recruitment and survival of two dominant fouling organisms, the barnacle Balanus eburneus and the bryozoan Bugula neritina. Manipulative field experiments were designed to separate out chemical versus abrasion effects of the drift organisms. In recruitment trials, replicate surfaces were submerged as one of five treatments: caged with live drift species, caged with drift mimic, empty cage, partial cage and uncaged control.

The functional morphology of jaw protrusion among neotropical cichlids. The evolution of protrusible upper jaws among acanthopterygian teleosts has long been argued a major factor contributing to the success of this extremely diverse group of fishes. Yet, few studies have investigated upper jaw protrusion in a comparative frame? work. Additionally, previously unstudied taxa are revealing new kinematic pathways of protrusion of not only the upper jaws but also the lower jaws. In this investigation the kine? matics, functional morphology, and perfor? mance measures of upper and lower jaw protrusion were analyzed among several Central and South American cichlids. Petenia splendida and a member of its sis? ter genus, Caquetaia spectabile, both which exhibit extreme jaw protrusion were com? pared to each other and to the basal outgroups Cichla ocellaris and Astronotus ocellatus which do not exhibit the same level of jaw protrusion. Digital high speed film (500 fps) of feeding on live guppy prey was utilized to compare kinematic and perfor? mance variables. Dissection and bone/car- tilage clearing and staining were used to compare the functional morphology among the taxa. Unlike much of the previous work on jaw protrusion, kinematic data was used to measure prey capture performance by measuring the ram and suction components of successful feeding events. Feeding per? formance data was used to explore the rela? tionship between jaw protrusion and the generation of suction and ram. Compari? sons of dissected and cleared and stained specimens revealed novel joints within the suspensorium allowing considerable lower jaw protrusion coordinated with upper jaw protrusion in Petenia splendida and Caquetaia spectabile. Finally, patterns of kinematic and morphological convergence will be compared among Petenia splendida, Caquetaia spectabile, and other distantly re? lated extreme jaw protruding teleosts. 38.4 WARKENTIN, KM, University of Ken? tucky and Smithsonian Tropical Re. Hatch? ing as a defense against egg predators: the role of vibrational cues. Red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, lay their eggs on vegetation overhanging water, into which the tad? poles fail at hatching. The age and devel? opmental stage at which hatching occurs varies. The ability of hatchlings to escape from aquatic predators improves with de? velopment, and undisturbed embryos hatch relatively late. However, well before spontaneous hatching occurs, embryos will hatch rapidly in response to attack by egg-eating snakes or wasps. The rapid, synchronous early hatching (escape hatching) appears to be a specific re? sponse to mechanical disturbance of the egg clutch by predators. It occurs only af? ter predators have begun physically ma- nipulating eggs, and similar responses can be induced with artificial mechanical stimuli. Embryos are, however, unrespon- sive to a variety of benign natural distur? bances, including wind, rain and earth- quakes, as well as to some artificial distur? bances. I used a sub-miniature acceler- ometer inserted among the embryos in A. callidryas egg clutches to record vibrations produced in snake attacks, wasp attacks, rain, and several types of artificial distur? bance. I presented these recorded vibra? tions to hatchable eggs via a minishaker interfaced with the clutches through a set of tines inserted between eggs. Playbacks of recorded snake attacks elicited more hatching than did playbacks of intensity- matched rain recordings. Furthermore, playbacks of natural rain elicited less hatching than did playbacks of rain that were edited to dump drops together and artificially extend still intervals between periods of vibration.

Maternal and en? vironmental contributions to hatchling phe? notypes and survival ofthe lizard Sceloporus undulatus. Phenotypic variation of hatchling reptiles is influenced by environmental conditions during egg incubation and by various ma? ternal sources. We investigated the effects of incubation moisture conditions, maternal yolk investment, and clutch on various phe? notypic traits and subsequent survival of hatchlings of the lizard, Sceloporus undulatus. Eggs from 28 clutches were in? cubated under two moisture regimes (-150 kPa and -530 kPa) to evaluate the effect of incubation moisture on hatchling pheno? types. Yolk was removed from eggs in an? other treatment to evaluate the effect of yolk investment on hatchling phenotypes. After hatching, snout-vent length, mass, tail length, growth rate, thermal preference, run? ning speed, and desiccation rate were mea? sured for each hatchling. Hatchlings were released at a field site near Blacksburg, Vir? ginia and monitored until winter and again the following spring. Incubation moisture had a small effect on hatchling body size; hatchlings incubated under wet conditions were slightly larger than those from dry con? ditions. Maternal yolk investment had a simi? lar effect on hatchling body size; eggs with yolk removed resulted in small bodied hatchlings. Neither incubation moisture nor yolk investment had an effect on perfor? mance; clutch explained most of the varia? tion in phenotypes. Similarly, survival was not affected by treatment, but was associ? ated with clutch. Hatchlings that survived longer than 6 weeks grew more slowly than those that did not survive to six weeks. As? suming rapid growth rate is associated with high activity, the more rapidly growing hatchlings could have been conspicuous to predators. In general, our observations dem? onstrate the importance of maternal (clutch) contributions to offspring fitness. S14.9 WASSERSUG, R.J, Dalhousie Uni- versity. Problems in metamorphosis above the molecular level. Tadpoles from a single clutch, which hatch at approximately equal size, can vary in size by nearly an order of magnitude by the time they metamorphose. This observa? tion has led to extensive research by ecolo? gists on social and environmental factors that influence metamorphosis. Independently, molecular biologists have made great strides in understanding genetic programs in tad? pole tissues that are activated when meta? morphosis begins. What has been largely missing in our efforts to understand meta? morphosis are the mechanistic links be? tween the factors studied by ecologists and the genes studied by molecular biologists. We do not understand, for example, how extrinsic factors, such as density or water depth, are sensed by amphibian larvae and ultimately manifested as changes in gene transcription within specific tissues. In my talk I will review some of the environmental fac? tors that influence size at metamorphosis by influencing growth. I will then present a set of heuristic models that explore the balance between growth and metamorphosis at the tissue level, in an effort to develop testable hypotheses about the link between the en? vironmental and molecular regulation of metamorphosis. 59.3 WATTS, P*, FISH, F, Applied Fluids Engineering, Inc, West Chester University. Fluid dynamic role of tubercles on hump- back whale flippers. Tubercles are leading edge protrusions on the flippers of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Humpback whales are the only baleen whales that cap? ture prey through routine tight maneuvers. We investigated the fluid dynamic benefits of tubercles with regard to force production by the flippers. Fluid dynamic simulations were carried out with inviscid, panel method, computer simulations applied to steady, three-dimensional flow about an airfoil. At a modest angle of attack of 10 degrees, the tubercles enhance lift by 5% and reduce drag by 10%, respectively. The additional lift is derived in part from low pressure regions between tubercles. Drag is reduced through 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

The result is an increase in both the relative and absolute performance of humpback whale flippers as control de? vices during tight maneuvers. In modifying the flow over the flipper, the tubercles can also extend the useful performance enve? lope of the flipper. This work provides the first dynamical evidence that tubercles could indeed be functional adaptations that en? hance prey capture for humpback whales. SU.2WEBB, PW, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Ml. Mechanisms for the control of posture and swimming trajectories of fishes. Fish with a high density ratio can achieve stability on the substratum. Morphological design criteria stabilizing station holding and maximizing current speeds displacing fish are well known, but optimal designs for all criteria are not possible. In the water col? umn, fish are inherently unstable. Posture of fish in the water column is not stable be? cause the metacentric height is typically negative and the centers of mass are sepa? rated longitudinally. When gas inclusions are used to regulate density, altitude is not stable. Neutrally buoyant fish are unstable in coast- ing. Biological materials are deformable, and some control surfaces are forward of the center of mass both of which tend to amplify disturbances. When swimming, stability de? pends on dynamic controls, generated by the same range of body and fin appendages that introduce instabilities for maneuvering. Dynamic forces may be passive, resulting from flow over the control surface due to the motion of the body, or self-powered. Pow? ered controls are required to stabilize alti? tude and swimming trajectories at low speeds, but these are energetically expen- sive. Passive controls are effective and more economical at higher speeds and can be self-correcting. Predictable disturbances, such as recoil, may be damped using pas? sive systems, but powered control is required to improve the smoothness of swimming tra? jectories. Unpredictable disturbances are a greater challenge, especially when self-cor- rection is not possible or inadequate, and when response delays occur. Some prelimi? nary observations suggest reliance on pow? ered control affects the distribution of vari? ous fish morphs in hydrodynamically vari? able habitats.

To enhance student learning of physiologi? cal concepts, build a departmental culture of inquiry, and motivate students to pursue studies of animal biology, we use indepen? dent laboratory projects as a primary mode for instruction in our comparative animal physiology courses. Students are first ex? posed to standard recording techniques and animal preparations. After directed litera? ture studies and discussion of experimental design, we ask students to design their own laboratory investigations. Four to six weeks of lab meetings are devoted to the students' independent work. End-of-term reports take the form of research articles or poster pre- sentations. Focused studies that are exten- sions of the published literature or that use well studied organisms or methods seem to be most successful; we direct students away from equipment-intensive or overly broad projects. Our experience has been that this model of laboratory instruction takes more instructor time for animal husbandry, equip- ment maintenance, and ordering supplies than courses using traditional "cookbook" exercises. We also observe, however, greater student interest and enthusiasm, and higher academic achievement in success? ful students. Students take ownership of the material, become experts on a particular topic, and understand concepts at a depth not realized in most undergraduate science courses.

The dictionary definition of stability as "Firmly established, not easily to be changed" immediately indicates the conflict between stability and maneuverability in aquatic lo? comotion. The present paper addresses sev- 1252 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="329">eral issues resulting from these opposing requirements. Classical stability theory for bodies moving in fluids is based on devel- opments in submarine and airship motions. These have lateral symmetry, in common with most animals. This enables the separa? tion of the equations of motion into two sets of 3 each. The longitudinal set, which includes motions in the axial (surge), normal (heave) and pitching directions, can thus be sepa? rated from yaw, roll and sideslip motions. This has been found useful for longitudinal sta? bility studies based on coasting configura- tions (e.g. Weihs, 1993) but is not applicable to the analysis of turning, fast starts and vig- orous swimming, where the lateral symme? try of the fish body is broken by bending motions. The present paper will examine the stability vs. maneuverability aspects of these asymmetric motions, starting off with an analysis of the conditions under which the separation of equations of motions is le- gitimate, and a definition of the equations to be used in cases where the separation is not accurate enough. Several examples are presented, including: 1) BCF locomotion is inherently unstable in yaw due to the side- ways excursions of the rear body and the flexibility of the body. a) in rectilinear swim? ming, the pectorals are used to counteract and damp yawing motions of the head. b) turning motions, in which the instability is utilized, to improve performance. c) rapid starting, where various combinations of a and b are applied. 2) An analysis of the influ? ence of the highly elliptic shape of body cross-sections in certain species in enhanc? ing stability by reducing the interaction of yawing and rolling motions. 35.6 WEINSTEIN, R.B.*, HARTMAN, J.H, University of Arizona, Tucson. Modeling the intermittent exercise strategy of "ride and tie* competition. Intermittent exercise is characterized by bouts of exercise alternated with pauses. When exercise bouts are performed at a high intensity, brief pauses provide time for re? covery from the preceding exercise bout. In "Ride and Tie", a competitive sport incorpo- rating intermittent exercise, teams consist of two humans, who alternate running and riding, and one horse, who alternates run? ning and resting. Teams may make 30-40 exchanges (i.e., ties) in a 60 km race. We modeled an infinite race as a series of exer? cise and recovery intervals. Human and Ara- bian horse records were used to derive maximum running speed as a function of interval distance. Interval training tables were used to derive minimum recovery time as a function of exercise intensity and dura? tion. For each interval distance from 0.4-5.0 km we determine the conditions (i.e., run? ning speed, percent effort, and recovery time) under which the humans or the horse are the limiting factor(s), select the conditions that maximize team speed, and then select the interval distance that maximizes team speed. The final solution provides the inter? val distance and running time for each team member that maximizes team speed. A team composed of a world class horse and hu? mans should run 3.2 km intervals. Slower teams should use shorter intervals. Increas? ing the minimum recovery time slows maxi? mum team speed and decreases the opti? mal interval distance. Several features of the "Ride and Tie" model, such as the trade-off between exercise intensity and recovery time, are applicable to modeling traditional forms of intermittent exercise. 30.2 WELCH, AM., University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. What is good about "good genes" in gray tree frogs: how is call duration linked with larval quality? Male displays traits are predictive of off? spring quality in some species, although the basis of the relationship between dis? play traits and offspring quality is not well understood. Female gray tree frogs prefer male calls of long duration, and offspring of males with long calls were of higher quality than were offspring of males with short calls in laboratory experiments. I tested whether variation in tadpole activ? ity and metabolism contributed to an ef? fect of call duration on larval period or mass at metamorphosis. I measured time spent feeding, ingestion rate, digestive efficiency, larval period, and mass at metamorpho? sis for tadpoles from eight maternal half- sibships (each sired by one long-calling 800-955-1236 ?

In the low food treatment, off? spring of long-calling males were larger at metamorphosis than were offspring of short-calling males, but had similar larval periods; in the high food treatment, off? spring of long- and short-calling males did not differ in mass at metamorphosis or lar? val period. At both food levels, tadpoles that spent more time feeding tended to have higher ingestion rates, and tadpoles with higher ingestion rates tended to have shorter larval periods. In the low food treat? ment, higher digestive efficiency also con? tributed to shorter larval periods. Time spent feeding, ingestion rate, and diges? tive efficiency did not affect mass at meta? morphosis in either food treatment. Thus, the effect of call duration on mass at meta? morphosis detected in this experiment is not attributable to variation in activity, in? gestion rate, or digestive efficiency. None- theless, variation in ingestion rate may have contributed to an effect of fatheris call duration on larval period in previous ex? periments.

The ubiquitous arborescent bryozoan Bugula neritina lives attached to substrata and is subjected to tidal currents in estua? rine areas. Itslarvae have a very short plank? tonic period (minutes to hours), so the tim? ing of release relative to the state of the tide is critical in determining how far the larvae will be transported during their planktonic existence. Prior work has found that B. neritina release larvae upon exposure to bright lights after a period of darkness, akin to sunrise in the field. However, no prior research has considered whether B. neritina alters its be? havior in flow to release larvae during a par? ticular state of the tide. We compared the larval release behavior of B. neritina in still water and in 1 and 5 cm s1 flows in a flow tank. There was no difference between re? lease in 1 cm s1 flow and still water. How? ever, in 5 cm 1 flow, B. neritina released fewer larvae than in still water. This indicates that B. neritina preferentially releases larvae in still water or very slow flow, suggesting a selective pressure to retain larvae close to their parent population, presumably to re? main in a favorable habitat.

Coevolutionary genetics of Plasmodium malaria parasites and their human hosts Malaria has been invoked perhaps more than any other infectious disease as a force in the selection of human genetic polymorphisms. Evidence for genome shaping interactions can be found in the geographic and ethnic distributions of the hemoglobins, blood group antigens, thalassemias, host cell membrane mol? ecules, HLA classes and cytokines. Hu? man genetic variations and immuno-pro- tective defenses correspondingly influ? ence the structure and polymorphisms of Plasmodium parasite populations, notably in genes that affect the success and viru? lence of infection. Coevolutionary adapta? tions likewise occur with the mosquitoes responsible for the transmission of malaria parasites in human populations. Four Plas? modium species are responsible for the usual human malarias. The species re? sponsible for the most acute and deadly form of malaria, P. falciparum, is related to a avian parasite and may be a recent in? troduction into humans. The three other parasite species have emerged from longstanding evolutionary relationships with primates, which may explain their ten? dency to produce less severe forms of the disease. In Africa, where the selective force from P klciparum is strongest, the sever- ity of malaria and its manifestations vary in prevalence among human populations.

Energetics of larval swimming and metamorphosis in four spe? cies of Bugula (Bryozoa). The amount of energy available to lar? vae during swimming, location of a suitable recruitment site, and metamorphosis influ? ences the length of time larvae can spend in the plankton. Energetic parameters such as oxygen consumption during swimming and metamorphosis, and elemental carbon and nitrogen content were measured for larvae of four species of bryozoans, Bugula neritina, B. simplex, B. stolonifera, and B. turrita. The larvae of these species are aplanktotrophic with a short free-swimming phase ranging from less than one hour to a maximum of about 36 hours. There exists approximately a 5-fold difference in larval volume among the four species, which scales linearly with elemental carbon content and, presumably, with the amount of endogenous reserves available for swimming and metamorpho? sis. Specific metabolic rate and larval size were inversely related. For larvae of a given species, respiration rates remained similar for swimming and metamorphosis; however, because the duration of metamorphosis is about twice as long as a maximal larval swim? ming phase, it was more energetically de- manding. Larger larvae expended more energy to complete metamorphosis than did smaller larvae, but in terms of the percent? age of larval energy reserves consumed, swimming and metamorphosis were more 'expensive' for smaller larvae. A compari? son of the energy expended during larval swimming calculated on the basis of oxy? gen consumption and on the basis of el? emental carbon decrease suggests that lar? vae of Bugula spp. may not use significant amounts of dissolved organic material (DOM) to supplement their endogenous energy re? serves. S10.9 WERREN, J.H; University of Roch- ester. Evolution and consequences of Wolbachia symbioses in invertebrates. Wolbachia are a widespread group of bacteria that commonly found in insects, isopods, arachnids and nematodes. These cytoplasmically inherited bacteria cause a number of alterations in host reproduc? tion, including induction of sperm-egg in? compatibility, parthenogenesis, feminiza- tion of genetic males, and male-killing. These alterations enhance transmission of the bacteria within host populations. Wolbachia may also have evolved mutu? alistic interactions with hosts. These bac? teria are capable of moving between dis? tantly related host taxa by mechanisms that are as yet unclear. It has been proposed that these bacteria may play a role in rapid speciation in invertebrates; however, this view is controversial. Information is pre? sented on the evolutionary biology of these fascinating bacteria. In addition, theoreti? cal and empirical studies relating to the possible role or Wolbachia in host specia? tion is discussed. 1.5 WESP, HM*, GIBB, A.C, Northern Arizona University. Escape response perfor? mance in the larval razorback sucker, Xyrauchen texanus. The razorback sucker, Xyrauchen texanus, is an endangered fish native to the Colorado River system. Previous research suggests that declines in wild populations are due to a lack of larval recruitment. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that poor escape response performance of larval ra? zorback suckers contributes to low recruit? ment. The larval escape response behav? iors of razorback suckers reared at 12* C and 18* C were elicited and digitally re? corded over a developmental period to de? termine 1) if the larvae displayed the escape response and 2) if maximum swimming speed during the response was significantly slower than speeds reported for other fish larva. Response behaviors for 56 razorback suckers were digitized using Didge analy? sis software. Larval razorback suckers did display escape response behaviors, with speed of the response increasing as length increased during development. In addition, escape response speeds for suckers were similar to those reported for other fish larva at the same size. Preliminary temperature comparisons indicate that maximum swim- 800-955-1236 ?

This low value suggests that the colder water tem? perature does not significantly affect escape response behavior. Thus, it appears that ra? zorback suckers are capable of acclimating to lower Colorado River temperatures and poor escape response performance does not contribute to the lack of recruitment in the wild. Future work will compare escape response performance between the native razorback sucker and an introduced spe? cies, the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. 3.4 WESTNEAT, M.

The axial morphology of big marine fishes is a mechanical system specialized for both high performance swimming and long-distance cruising. The axial muscu? lature, connective tissues, and skeleton of tunas, mackerels, billfishes and their rela? tives exhibit modifications of the basic actinopterygian design for swimming that reveal mechanisms for the generation and transmission of force from muscle to cau? dal fin. The main horizontal septum is formed by the convergence of myosepta and is the major transmitter of muscle force to the axial skeleton. The vertical septum is formed from the serial neural and he? mal spines and a fabric of collagen fibers connecting them. Using polarized light, the collagen fiber matrix of the vertical sep? tum is shown to be a crossed-fiber array in which fibers are oriented in two primary directions, one coursing anterodistally and the other posterodistally from the back? bone at angles ranging from 45-55/ to the vertebral axis. A biomechanical model is proposed for the function of the neural spines and vertical septum inenergy stor? age and return in scombrids. In the tail, a posterior system of muscles and tendons operates the caudal fin of tunas, billfishes, and other taxa. Comparative morphology of the hypochordal longitudinalis, flexor dorsalis, flexor ventralis, infra-carinalis, supracarinalis, and interradialis muscles is presented. A new mechanical model is proposed for the function of the caudal muscles in fine tuning the shape and mo? tion of the caudal fin. Biomechanical mod? els make predictions about muscle func? tion and force transfer in locomotion of big marine fishes that may direct future re? search on muscle function. Key features of the locomotor design of tunas, macker- els and outgroups are highlighted on a phylogeny to identify the major evolution? ary stages in the functional morphology of scombrid locomotion.

Applying what you learned in class: transforming biological laboratory education so that it is universally accessible. Creating Laboratory Access for Science Students (The CLASS Project) is an NSF- f unded initiative to train educators to develop lab exercises and field trips that are univer? sally accessible through attendance at a 2 week workshop. Pre/post assessment has demonstrated that the CLASS workshop improves educators' attitudes about and pre- paredness to teach science to student with disabilities. This talk will highlight how edu? cators have translated their CLASSroom ex? perience back to their home institution. Sys- temically reforming the biological laboratory education of all students will involve build- ing a network of educators trained in sci? ence and disability.

As? sessment of sexual dimorphism in the antillean insectivoran Nesophontes. The Antillean insectivoran Nesophontes is known only from subfossil material from Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and the Cay- man Islands. When the first Nesophontes species was described from Puerto Rico, specimens appeared to fail into 2 size classes, and this size variation was inter? preted as sexual dimorphism. Additional species discovered subsequently from other islands also appeared to exhibit dimorphism, though these new species were smaller and the dimorphism was less pronounced. Sexual dimorphism is minimal in extant insectivorans, and the level inferred for Nesophontes is unexpected. We used skull measurements taken on more than 1500 Nesophontes specimens to evaluate this proposed sexual dimorphism, as well as 3 alternative hypotheses for the dimorphism: temporal variation, geographic variation, and presence of additional unrecognized spe? cies. Study taxa were N. edithaekom Puerto Rico and N. paramicrus, N. hypomicrus, and N. zamicrus from Hispaniola. Temporal varia? tion and geographic variation are not sup- ported by our data, and it is unlikely that there would be a cryptic species paired with each of these recognized species. We there? fore conclude that Nesophontes did exhibit sexual dimorphism. The level of sexual di? morphism in these 4 taxa increases allometrically, with the largest species (N. edithae) exhibiting much greater dimorphism than the smallest species (N. zamicrus).

Molecular tools based on small subunit (SSU) rDNA gene sequences offer a pow? erful and rapid tool for the analysis of com? plex microbial communities found in the gas? trointestinal (Gl) tracts of food animal spe? cies. Extensive comparative sequence analysis of SSU rRNA molecules represent- ing a wide diversity of organisms shows that different regions of the molecule vary in se? quence conservation. Oligonucleotides complementing regions of universally con- versed 16S rRNA sequence are used as universal probes while those complement? ing more variable regions of sequence are useful as selective probes targeting species, genus, or phylogenetic groups. Different ap? proaches derive different information and this is highly dependent on the type of target nucleic acid employed and the conceptual and technical basis used for nucleic acid probe design. Generally these approaches can be divided into DNA-based methods employing empirically characterized probes and rRNA-based methods based on com? parative sequence analysis for design and interpretation of "rational" probes. Poly- merase chain reaction (PCR) based tech? niques can also be applied to the analysis of microbial communities in Gl tracts. Direct cloning of SSU rDNA genes amplified from these complex communities can be used to determine the extent of diversity in these Gl communities. Denaturing gradient gel elec? trophoresis (DGGE) is another powerful tool for profiling microbial diversity of microbial communities in Gl tracts. Sequence analy? sis of the excised DGGE amplicons can then be used to presumptively identify predomi? nant bacterial species. Examples of how 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Reilly Buffalo State College and Ohio University Abdominal motor dynamics in mammal locomotion II: Integration of ventilation with "cross-couplef body support And footfall patterns in trotting opossums. Video-flouroscopy and elec? tromyography were used to investigate epipubic bone movement and associated abdominal muscle activation during loco? motion on a motorized treadmill in two didelphid marsupials, Didelphis virginiana and Monodelphis domestica. In both spe? cies, the epipubic bones exhibited little move? ment during locomotion (only symmetrical gaits were observed) or ventilation. Ventila? tion was inferred through the visualization of diaphragmatic displacements. The ob? served patterns of muscle activation of ab? dominal muscles (external oblique, internal oblique, rectus abdominus, pyramidalis) exhibited either four bursts of activity during a stride (usually single-footed, slow walks) or two bursts per stride (faster, trotting gaits). In the former pattern, muscle activation was bilateral. At higher velocities of locomotion, both bilateral and asymmetrical, unilateral activation of muscles were observed.

Interclutch variability of sex ratios produced at pivotal temperature in a turtle with temperature-de? pendent sex determination. The red-eared slider turtle, Trachemy scripta, has a Male/Female (MF) pattern of temperature-dependent sex determination in which cooler incubation temperatures pro? duce males and warmer temperatures pro? duce females. The pivotal temperature (tem? perature producing a 1:1 sex ratio) has been suggested to be near 29.4?C. In the current study, 20 clutches of eggs were incubated at 29.4?C. All of the clutches were laid during the same 24 hour period and average clutch size was approximately 8 eggs. Individual clutches were kept separate throughout in? cubation and were rotated within incubators. Of the 20 clutches, 19 produced viable hatchlings. The sex of hatchlings was as? sessed by examining the structure of the gonads. Overall, an approximate 1:1 sex ratio was produced (79 males:78 females). However, the results reveal significant interclutch variation in sex ratios. Clutch sex ratios varied from 100% male to 100% fe? male. The results support the hypothesis that pivotal temperatures may vary due to clutch-specific factors.

The trackway of a tetrapod, worm tracks, fern imprints, and other surface features fossalized in a soft mud from the Pennsyl? vanian period have been recovered from a West Virginia coal strip-mine. Stride and pace analysis over a recovered distance of about 150 cm indicate that the tetrapod featured four gracile digits on the presump? tive forelimb and five on the hind limb, with stocky body proportions. The stride length between each imprint of the same limb is essentially constant at 29 cm, apparently in a slow walk. There is no over-stride of one limb's imprints upon the other, indi? cating the the trunk length is neither rela? tively long with short limbs, nor short with long limbs. The palmar (3.5 cm diameter) and plantar (4.0 cm diameter) imprints are separated from left to right by a pace width of about 14 cm (center to center). The pace angulation from righ to left, etc measured 95-97 degrees, which falls in the range of living salamanders and reptiles, and indi? cates the limbs were relatively well posi? tioned under the weight of the body. The absence of a tail imprint indicates it was either missing, too short to drag in the mud, or held errect.

Function and evolution of upper jaw protru? sion mechanisms in elasmobranchs. Upper jaw protrusion is an important component of the feeding mechanism in most elasmobranchs. To quantify the me? chanics of feeding, particularly those of up? per jaw protrusion, in four diverse species of elasmobranchs we used anatomical dissec- tion, electromyography and high-speed video recordings. Our results show that while certain muscles show a common pattern of motor activity among the four species dur? ing feeding, other muscles are functionally and evolutionarily plastic. Our observations of elasmobranch upper jaw protrusion mechanisms suggests a mosaic of charac? ter changes over the course of evolution that involve anatomical changes in all cases and modifications of muscle activation patterns in some cases. The muscles involved in up? per jaw retraction also show modulation in some species and may be active during jaw opening as well as in jaw retraction. The pri? mary jaw closing muscle in a durophagous shark exhibits an extended double-burst pat? tern of motor activity during crushing of hard- shelled prey. Within the evolution of feeding mechanisms of elasmobranchs, there are several structural changes that retain a con? served motor pattern and behavior. At least one instance of structural modification is ac? companied by an alteration in the motor pat? tern which led to a change in behavior. Fi? nally, several instances of plasticity in acti? vation of certain muscles exist. 3.6 WILGA, C.D. *, LAUDER, G. V, Univer? sity of Rhode Island, Kingston, Harvard Uni? versity, Cambridge, MA. Function of the het? erocercal tail in sharks: quantitative wake dynamics during steady horizontal swim? ming and vertical maneuvering. The function of the heterocercal tail in sharks has long been debated in the litera? ture. Previous kinematic data have sup? ported the classical theory which proposes that the beating of the heterocercal caudal fin during steady horizontal locomotion pushes posteroventrally on the water which generates a reactive force directed anterodorsally. To quantify the function of the heterocercal shark tail during both horizon? tal locomotion and vertical maneuvering, we measured the orientation of tail vortices shed into the wake and the orientation of the cen? tral vortex jet through the core of these vorti? ces. We used digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) with both horizontal and vertical light sheet orientations to quantify patterns of wake velocity and vorticity be? hind the heterocercal tail of both leopard and bamboo sharks swimming freely at 1.0 L/s. Analysis of flow geometry indicates that both leopard and bamboo shark tails generate strongly tilted vortex rings with a mean jet angle of approximately 40^ below horizon? tal during steady horizontal swimming. The corresponding angle of the reaction force is much greater than either body angle (mean -11?) and the angle of the path of motion of the center of mass (mean -0?), thus strongly supporting the classical model for steady hori? zontal locomotion. Vortex jet orientation is significantly more inclined than the relatively horizontal jet generated by sturgeon tail vor? tex rings, further supporting the substantial differences in function in the heterocercal tails of sharks and sturgeon. 55.1 WILKENS, J.L, YAZAWA, T, SHINOZAKI, T, terKEURS, H.E.D.J, Univer? sity of Calgary, Calgary, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Tohoku University, Sendai, University of Calgary.

Conventional wisdom holds that arid- zone birds occupy these climes because of the possession of physiological design fea? tures common to all members of the class Aves. Using broad scale comparisons, we tested the idea that desert birds have re? duced energy expenditure and water loss compared to mesic counterparts. We showed that desert birds have a reduced basal meta? bolic rate (BMR), a reduced field metabolic rate, and a lower total evaporative water loss. Conventional analysis of covariance indi? cated that desert birds have reduced water flux in the field, but an analysis based on phylogenetically independent contrasts did not support this finding. We further searched for physiological specialization amongst members of the Alaudidae from mesic habi? tats in the Netherlands and from arid habi? tats in Saudi Arabia. Using DNA sequences from the mitochondrial b gene, we con? structed a phylogeny of larks from Europe and from the Middle East, and then selected species for physiological studies based on our results. We found that BMR and TEWL is reduced in larks from deserts compared to larks from more mesic areas supporting our hypothesis of evolutionary specialization. The evolutionary significance of our finding that BMR and TEWL is reduced in desert birds remains unresolved because differ? ences may result from physiological accli? mation, from genetic sculpting by natural selection, or from a combination of both. We conducted an experiment on the phenotypic flexibility of BMR in Hoopoe Larks from Arabia. We exposed groups to either 15oC or 36oC for 3 weeks. For larks in the 15oC group, BMR averaged 142% higher than larks in the 36oC group, a result attributable, in part, to a larger kidney, liver, and small intestine. Similar experiments are in progress on larks in the Netherlands. 63.4 WILLIAMS.

Fatty acid profiles as? sociated with diapause egg production in two species of freshwater calanoid copep? ods. The copepods Aglaodiaptomus (= Diaptomus) Stagnalis and A. clavipoidesco- occur in certain ephemeral ponds. Both spe? cies hatch from diapause (resting) eggs when pond sediments are freshly inundated and mature rapidly to adults. Both are believed to be univoltine, producing resting eggs only. In order to understand how diapause eggs are sustained during a potentially long dor? mancy, lipid classes and fatty acid profiles of the two species were compared. Our previ? ous study showed that female A. stagnalis with egg sacs had higher concentrations of specific fatty acids compared to females with? out eggs. The specific objective of the present study was to determine if essential fatty acids, required for growth and develop- 1260 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="337">ment of all animals, are preferentially mobi- lized from females to their eggs. Males, non- gravid females and gravid females were assayed; egg sacs containing developing diapause eggs were removed from gravid females so th! at eggs and mothers were analyzed separately. Our results confirm that high concentrations of specific fatty acids are incorporated into the diapause eggs of A. stagnalis but not of A. clavipoides. In the former species, concentrations of both iino- lenic (18:3w3) and linoleic acid (18:2w6) are higher in eggs than in females which in turn have higher concentrations than males. However, all life history stages of A. clavipoides have similar concentrations of these two fatty acids. Although concentra? tions of omega-3 fatty acids are generally higher in eggs of A. stagnalis than in adults, concentrations of the essential fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5w3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6w3) are lower. In contrast, concentrations of these fatty ac? ids are similar in eggs and adults of A. clavipoides. 40.4 WILLINK, PW., Field Museum. The in- tertwining influences of prey, head shape, and attack behavior on gill raker morphol? ogy. Gill rakers are believed to play a critical function during the feeding of fishes. The pre- dominant view is that gill rakers strain prey from the medium. Long, closely-spaced gill rakers are correlated with feeding on small prey, whereas short, widely-spaced gill rak? ers are correlated with feeding on large prey. However, this view may be too simplistic. Based on data from sunfishes (Perciformes: Centrarchidae), it will be argued that gill raker morphology is dependent not only on prey size, but also on the interdependent factors of attack behavior and mouth struc? ture. Species which ram feed tend to have larger mouths and hence longer gill rakers. The opposite is true for suction feeding spe? cies. Differences in the pattern of water flow past the branchial arches is hypothesized to be the primary causal agent for the various gill raker morphologies. These ideas may help explain the feeding structures of north- western North America sticklebacks, Great Lakes coregonids, and many other fishes. 9.6 WILMHOFF, C D. *, MCCLAIN, W R., GUTZKE, W H N., University of Cincinnati, The University of Memphis, The Univers'rty of Memphis. The effect of temperature and stage of development on resting metabo? lism in an aquatic environment. Organisms capable of reducing mainte? nance costs are able to invest a greater amount of energy into growth, body re? serves, and/or reproduction. In ectothermic organisms temperature has repeatedly been demonstrated to affect resting metabo? lism, an indicator of maintenance costs. De? spite this wealth of information, the effect of temperature on resting metabolism in plethodontid salamanders in an aquatic environment has not been examined. The present study examined the resting metabo- lism of the adult and larvae of the plethodontid salamander, Eurycea junaluska in an aquatic environment across four ex? perimental temperatures (5, 15, 20, and 25?C). Animals were acclimated to 20?C and resting metabolic rates were determined using a closed respirometry system. Adults exhibited a significantly higher resting me? tabolism at 20?C and 25?C than larvae. There was no statistical difference in resting metabolic rates of larvae between 5?C and 20?C. Resting metabolism in adults exhib? ited a curvilinear increase with increasing temperature.

Morphology of the lat? eral line canals of the head in chimaerid fishes (Family Chimaeridae).

Diet prefer? ences for certain fatty acids and its effect on composition of fat reserves in migratory red- eyed vireos. Most birds accumulate large lipid stores as the primary source of energy for fueling their migratory flights. The composition of these lipid stores varies among species; however, 16-carbon and 18-carbon fatty acids typically comprise 50-90% of the lip? ids. Palmitate (16:0) and oleate (18:1) are usually the predominant fatty acids in the depot fat of migrating birds. We studied fatty acid preferences and the influence of diet on the composition of fat reserves in migra? tory red-eyed vireos using semi-synthetic diets that differed only in fatty acid composi? tion. Using paired food-preference tests, we found that daily food intake of red-eyed vireos was higher on diets containing triolein (18:1) than diets containing tristearin (18:0), higher on diets containing tripalmitin (16:0) than diets containing tristearin (18:0), and higher on diets containing trimyristin (14:0) than diets containing tripalmitin (16:0). Daily food intake of vireos was similar on diets containing triolein (18:1) and trilinolein (18:2). These results suggest that red-eyed vireos can diseriminate between diets differing only in fatty acid composition and that they prefer diets with mostlv lona-chain unsaturated fattv acids. We studied the effect of fatty acid com? position of the diet on the fatty acid composi? tion of fat reserves by maintaining vireos for one month on diets with different dietary fatty acids. The proportion of 16- and 18- carbon fatty acids in the depot fat of vireos was simi? lar to that of their diets. However, the pres? ence of very long-chain unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., 22:4, 24:5) in the depot fat of vireos, despite its absence in the diets, sug? gests that selective metabolism of fatty ac? ids is also important in determining the fatty acid composition of depot fat in migratory birds. 57.5 WILSON, CM*, HOLBERTON, R.L, University of Mississippi, University of Maine. The endocrine basis for trade-offs between immediate survival and reproductive suc? cess in arctic- and temperate-breeding yel? low warblers. While temperate breeding birds can renest or produce more than one success? ful clutch each year, Arctic-breeders are un? likely to raise more than one clutch annually due to shorter breeding seasons and un- predictable weather. Despite these con? straints, many birds successfully breed in the Arctic, suggesting that trade-offs between individual risk and reproductive success dif? fer between Arctic- and temperate breeders. The mobilization of higher plasma levels of corticosterone helps individuals survive en? vironmental perturbations, particularly for those living in extreme and stochastic envi? ronments. However, high concentrations of corticosterone are incompatible with repro? duction. We have asked how high latitude- breeding birds with limited opportunities to breed cope with the trade-off between the personal benefits of the corticosterone stress response needed in such an environment, and the possible cost in reproduction that such a response may incur. In 1999 and 2000, we found that Arctic-breeding male Yellow Warblers, who must contribute sig? nificantly to parental care, reduce acute cor? ticosterone secretion during times of high? est parental expenditure. The cost of this re? sponse to the individual and the mechanism by which it occurs are under investigation. Other temperate breeding species, to date, 1262 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ? McLean VA 22101</page><page sequence="339">have not shown a similar reduction; samples from temperate-breeding Yellow Warblers are currently being analyzed. If temperate breeding males do not exhibit a similarly reduced stress response, this phenomenon may represent a mechanism by which two different strategies expressed within the same species might maximize reproductive success under disparate ecological con? straints. S9.5 WINGFIELD, J.C, University of Wash? ington Washington, Seattle. Endocrine re? sponses to unpredictable environmental events: stress or anti-stress hormones? In addition to seasonal changes in mor? phology, physiology and behavior that oc? cur in predictable annual cycles, there are facultative responses to unpredictable events known as labile (i.e. short-lived) per- turbation factors (LPFs). These rapid behav? ioral and physiological changes have been termed the "emergency" life history stage (ELHS) and serve to enhance life time fit? ness. Glucocorticosteroids interacting with other hormones in the hypothalamo-pitu- itary-adrenal (HPA) cascade, initiate and or- chestrate the ELHS within minutes to hours. Components of the ELHS include: redirec- tion of behavior from a normal life history stage to increased foraging, irruptive-type migration during the day, enhanced restful- ness at night, elevated gluconeogenesis and recovery once the perturbation passes. These physiological and behavioral changes al? low an individual to avoid potential deleteri? ous effects of stress that may result from chronically elevated levels of circulating glucocorticosteroids over days and weeks. Several field studies in diverse habitats in? dicate that free-living populations have el? evated circulating levels of corticosteroids when in an ELHS. However, expression of an ELHS may not always be advantageous and there is accumulating evidence from birds that the adrenocortical responses to LPFs are modulated both on seasonal and individual levels. These changes in respon? siveness to LPFs may have ecological bases such as reproductive state, body con? dition etc, that in turn may indicate different control mechanisms in the HPA cascade. Some simple models based on food avail- able in the habitat, body condition, social status and life history stage, may allow pre? dictions of sensitivity of the HPA axis to LPFs. S15.8 WINGFIELD, J.C*, SOMA, K.K, Uni? versity of Washington, Seattle. Autumn and spring territoriality: same behavior, different mechanisms. Vertebrates show a diverse array of so? cial behaviors associated with territoriality. The mechanisms by which these behavioral patterns are regulated by hormones are di? verse. Field and laboratory experiments in? dicate that general underlying themes - pos? sibly mechanisms - do exist. For example, in birds, testosterone activates a type of ag? gression, territorial behavior, in those spe? cies that are territorial only during the breed? ing season. Territoriality at other times ap? peared to be independent of gonadal hor? mone control. One obvious question is - why this diversity in control mechanisms ? Con? trol of testosterone secretion during the breeding season must balance the need to compete with other males and provide pa? rental care. Regulation of these behaviors by testosterone in the non-breeding season may incur substantial costs. The male song sparrow (Melospiza melodia morphna) of western Washington State, is sedentary and defends territories in both breeding and non- breeding seasons. Dominance interactions, territorial aggression and song during the non-breeding season are essentially identi? cal to those during the breeding season. Al? though in the non-breeding season plasma testosterone and estradiol levels are very low, treatment with an aromatase inhibitor decreases aggression and simultaneous im- plantation of estradiol restores territorial be? havior. These data suggest that the mecha? nism by which testosterone regulates terri? torial behavior at the central cell level re? mains intact throughout the year. How the hormonal message to activate such behav? ior gets to the brain in different season does, however, appear to be different. 49.5 WINNE, C T. *, KECK, M. B., Stephen F.

ABSTRACT- In field studies of activity and thermal biology of whiptail lizards (genus Cnemidophorus: Teiidae), a strong correla? tion has been noted between daily activity patterns and temperature: Cnemidophorus consistently emerge from underground re- treats at particular soil temperatures, and they retreat for a period of inactivity in the latemorning or early aftemoon when the soil reaches a particular high temperature. Past researchers have hypothesized that soil temperatures were the proximate cue that controlled daily activity. We experimentally tested this hypothesis, as well as hypoth? eses that hunger thresholds and high rates of evaporative water loss influence daily activity patterns in Cnemidophorus, to de? termine if a causal relationship exists. We found that although a critical soil tempera? ture was required to elicit the initiation of morning activity in C. inornatus and C. septemvittatus, it was not a necessary stimu? lus for the cessation of activity. Access to prey, and thus hunger thresholds, did not influence the pattern of daily activity in these species; moreover, evaporative water loss did not appear to explain the cessation of afternoon activity in these species. Revers- ing the photoperiods during our experiments led only to a change in the time of initiation of daily activity (i.e., activity began 12 h later), not a significant change in the duration of daily activity. We hypothesize that daily sur? face activity in these lizards is a circadian rhythm controlled by a biological clock. The biological clock is entrained to the photope? riod and/or temperature cycle. Thus, daily activity in C. inornatus and C. septemvittatus ceases relatively early without the influence of changing environmental conditions. P1.85 WINSTEAD, C J. *, CLAUSSEN, D.

Macrobrachium rosenbergii may experi? ence thermal and hypoxic stresses during their commercial cultivation and during transport of stock or post-harvest animals. We used noninvasive methods to monitor cardiac responses, scaphognathite beating, and activity of juvenile and adult animals subjected to cyclic temperature changes between 20 and 30 C. Half of the prawns were further exposed to moderate hypoxia (2 - 4.5 ppm 02) during the experimental pro? tocol. Changes in heart width during the car? diac cycle were used to estimate stroke vol? ume and cardiac output. Diastolic heart width exhibited a slight positive allometry with a scaling exponent of about 0.41. Overall, the effects of hypoxia were small and those of activity were inconsistent; however, both temperature and body size had a substan? tial influence on cardiorespiratory responses. The mean Q10s for heart rate (1.73) were greater than those for scaphognathite fre? quency (1.53).The Q10 response of heart rate was greater between 25 and 30 C than be? tween 20 and 25 C, and this difference was greater for smaller than for larger prawns. The scaling exponents for heart rate aver? aged about -0.10. Unlike heart rates, esti? mated stroke volumes and cardiac outputs did not respond to temperature in a consis? tent manner, but had mean scaling expo? nents of 1.09 and 0.99 respectively.

Giant Asian prawns are not overly sen? sitive to moderate hypoxia, and brief bouts of activity have only a modest impact on their subsequent cardiorespiratory responses.

X S15.1 WOLF,B.O., University of New Mexico, Albuquerque. Using stable isotopes ap? proaches to explore animal physiological ecology. Stable isotope methods have been used in a number of situations to study resource use by animals and rely on the observation that the isotopic composition of an animalfs tissues reflects that of its diet. The stable isotope approach can also tell us about an animalfs physiological status. For example, in some cases carbon isotope analysis of consumer tissues can indicate the macro- nutrients being utilized and potentially where these nutrients are being routed to in the consumeris body. Nitrogen isotope analy? ses of consumer tissues can provide addi? tional information about the nutritional sta? tus and trophic interactions of animal con? sumers. Carbon isotope analyses of breath carbon dioxide can even provide informa? tion about macro-nutrient catabolism in al? most real time. Finally, the analyses of hy? drogen isotope composition of the body wa? ter pool of free-living animals may provide information on thermal stress, evaporative water loss as a function of total water flux, and water resource use. Because of perva- siveness of fractionating processes in plants, animals and the environment, the stable iso? tope approach holds promise for examining the use and movement of specific macro- nutrients and the fate of water resources from a physiological perspective in free-living ani? mals.

Previous research has suggested that certain environmental pollutants interfere with the perception of chemical stimuli. It is not clear if the interference lies in masking the odor in the water itself or if there is a physiological effect on the olfactory recep? tor cells that can influence the behavior of the animal. In this study we exposed cray? fish to the agricultural chemical Metolachlor in an acute fashion. We subsequently tested the ability of the crayfish to perceive and re? spond appropriately to two chemical stimuli important to their survival, detection of dam? aged conspecifics and location of food re? sources. Results indicate that the behavior of exposed crayfish toward odor is detrimen- tally changed. We conclude that there is an affect on the ability of crayfish to perceive chemical signals after being exposed to the chemical Metolachlor and that this affect could alter the ecology of this organism. 44.1 WOODARD, A. *, SHARDO, J., Univer? sity of South Alabama, Mobile. Morphologi? cal changes associated with the develop? ment of feeding in red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus). The formation of a functional feeding ap? paratus in larval teleosts is a finely tuned, functionally integrated set of processes. We examined the formation of the feeding ap? paratus in the larval red snapper from hatch? ing (22 hr postfertiliza-tion) through mouth formation (70 hr pf). Two developmental se? ries were collected (1997 and 2000) at the Claude Peete Mariculture Center (Alabama Marine Resource Division, Gulf Shores) and examined using scanning electron micros? copy and clear and stain techniques. At hatching (22-25 hr pf) the head has not lifted from the yolk and the larvae are lacking all basic feeding structures. The larvae do not show signs of mouth cavitation, nor jaw or visceral arch formation, and the head re? mains attached to the yolk ventrally. As posthatch development continues and the head enlarges the yolk sac underlying the head recedes exposing the ventral surface of the head (36-50 hr pf).The single oil drop- let moves caudally with the receding yolk sac. Visceral arches form posterior to the optic vesicles on the ventrolateral surface of the larvae, while the pharynx expands both an? teriorly and laterally (-50 hr pf). At about 60 800-955-1236 ?

Daily rhythm of basal corticosterone levels is not synchro? nized with feeding activity in marine igua- nas. Basal plasma glucocorticoids (e.g., corti? costerone (B)) levels follow a circadian rhythm. The rhythm can be entrained by photoperiod and food availability and func? tions in aspects of energy metabolism. Ma? rine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) pro? vide a unique opportunity to better under? stand the rhythm of basal B levels because, unlike many vertebrates, feeding activity and photoperiod are uncoupled. Animals feed in the intertidal zone so feeding activity is determined by the tidal cycle. Since ani? mals live at the equator, photoperiod remains relatively constant. If B modulates feeding activity (or vice versa), then B should cycle with feeding activity and not photoperiod. Basal B levels in free-living female Marine iguanas were measured every 6 hours over 24 hours. We sampled again 1 week later when the tide cycle was reversed, and hence, the feeding cycle was shifted. The pattern of B levels between the two weeks was identi? cal, with a midday peak and a midnight low. Interestingly, the overall level of B was sig? nificantly higher the week when animals fed at midday, relative to the week when ani? mals fed either early in the morning or late in the afternoon. To conclude, the rhythm of basal B is not entrained to feeding activity, but is instead entrained to photoperiod or some process in phase with photoperiod. Because B levels peak at midday, we sug- gest that B functions in energy metabolism associated with basking. Basking is critical to digestion and energy metabolism in ecto? therms, and is most efficient at midday when the sun is hottest. 47.2 WOURMS, J.R, Clemson University So. Carolina. Rudimentary trophotaeniae of Ataeniobius embryos: an evolutionary in? termediate of teleost trophotaenial placen- tae. Embryonic trophotaeniae, external hind? gut derivatives, and the maternal ovarian epithelium comprise the trophotaenial pla- centa of goodeid and other fishes. For 60 years, Ataeniobius toweri was considered the only goodeid fish whose embryos lack trophotaeniae. Scanning EM, however, re? veals three, external, rudimentary trophotaeniae. Together, they form an hemi- spherical peduncle continuous with the hind? gut, bearing three lobes, one median dorsal and two lateral ventral. Trophotaenial cells have microvilli whereas adjacent skin cells have microplicae. Rudimentary trophotaeniae are the terminal developmen? tal phase in Ataeniobius and are equivalent to those of Phase 2 embryos of Ameca, a species in which continued growth produces trophotaeniae 15 mm long. Ataeniobius rep? resents an intermediate stage in the evolu? tionary model: 1: Hindgut externalization; 2. Establishment of rudimentary trophotaeniae; 3. Trophotaenial growth and morphogen? esis; 4.

Circadian aspects of hormonal regulation of metamorphosis in Rana catesbeiana. Most hormones exhibit a circadian, or 24- hr, rhythm synchronized by the light/dark (LD) cycle. Hormones such as melatonin (ML), adrenal cortical steroids, and prolactin may synergize with, or antagonize, the thyroid hormones (TH) which induce metamorpho? sis. Consequently, the relationship of their diurnal profiles in the plasma with those of the TH might be important in controlling the rate of metamorphosis. ML, which may dis- tribute a might? signal and regulate hormone rhythms in vertebrates, declines precipi- tously in the plasma at climax coincident with the rise inTH.The fall in plasma ML, which is induced prematurely by exogenous thyrox? ine (T4), occurs in contrast to the rise of adre? nal corticoids and prolactin at climax. Unlike T4 rhythms, which are stable throughout lar? val life, plasma corticoid and ML rhythms change from prometamorphosis to climax. Thus, the relationship of ML and adrenal ste? roid rhythms with the T4 rhythm changes during development. The acrophase of the T4 rhythms, and the diurnal profiles and cli- mactic changes of the corticoids and ML, are specific to each LD cycle. These, and other, results of ongoing work suggest that the influence of modulators on TH promo? tion of metamorphosis may have chronobiological aspects, which allow fine- tuning of the response to environmental con? ditions, and which might explain the varia? tions in the rate of metamorphosis that occur on different LD cycles, or when larvae are given exogenous hormones at different times of the day.

Diurnal profiles of adrenal cortical steroids in the plasma of bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) tadpoles. Adrenal cortical steroids may potentiate the action of the thyroid hormones (TH) in metamorphosis. The level of these hormones in bullfrog tadpole plasma has been deter? mined at various metamorphic stages but the diurnal rhythm has not been studied. Plasma corticosterone (CORT), hydrocorti- sone (HC), and aldosterone (ALDO) were measured over a 24-hr period. In both late prometamorphic and early climax tadpoles, the corticoid rhythms in the plasma varied with the light/dark (LD) cycle. On a given LD cycle HC and ALDO profiles were different from each other at prometamorphosis, and both rhythms changed at climax, when the diurnal profiles of all the steroids became similar. The 24-hr mean, and the highest point on the curves, were compared with results in the literature. CORT, which was only de? tectable at climax, and ALDO, values com? pared well with previous work but HC was considerably lower than had been reported. On 18L6D and 6L18D, CORT was much higher than ALDO at climax, but these two corticoids were nearly the same on 12L: 12D. The results show the importance of conduct- ing measurements of plasma hormones on a defined LD cycle, and of sampling through? out a 24-hr day to obtain accurate estimates of hormone levels at a given point in the life cycle.

Observations to date reveal the pres? ence of no pulmonary shunts, a result that supports the hypothesis that pulmonary shunting is dervived adaptation found in deep-diving and/or highly migratory aquatic turtles.

Recent gene KO studies have sug? gested that the developmental process of the anlage, the genital tubercle (GT), has much in common with those of limb buds. However, except for some previous genetic studies, systematic approach on several regulatory molecules during GT formation has not been performed. The shh and fibro? blast growth factor (Fgf) genes have been postulated as regulating several downstream genes during organogenesis. The Fgf8 gene was expressed in the distal urethral plate epithelium of the GT along with other marker genes expressed in the mesenchyme. The Shh gene was found to be expressed in the urethral plate epithelium. The urogenital ex? pression of the Shh gene was also reported by Bitgood and McMahon. To functionally analyze the role of the FGF and shh system during GT formation, an in vitro organ cul? ture system was utilized. It was suggested that the distal urethral plate epithelium of GT, the Fgf8 gene expressing region, regulates the outgrowth of GT The region was thus suggested as a candidate region for the sig? naling center during GT development. Ec? topic application of FGF8 beads to the mu? rine GT induced mesenchymal gene expres- sion, and also promoted the outgrowth of the GT. Experiments utilizing anti-FGF neu- tralizing antibody suggested a growth-pro? moting role for FGF protein(s) in GT out? growth. In contrast, the Fgf10 gene appears not to be primarily essential for initial out? growth of GT despite its vital role during limb bud formation. Rather, the abnormal exter? nal genitalia development of Fgf10 mutant perinatal mice suggested the importance of the Fgf10 gene in the development of the glans penis and the glans clitoridis. Our recent analysis on FGF and shh system will be presented. These data are expected to contribute elucidating " a model plan" for organogenesis of external genitalia and other organs such as limbs.

Antarctic notothenioids and northern cods are phylogenetically distant, but have convergently evolved near-identical anti? freeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) to survive in their respective freezing marine environ? ment. We have previously shown that Notothenioid AFGP gene evolved from a pancreatic trypsinogen-like protease gene, and extant AFGPs are encoded by a large family of polyprotein genes. The evolution? ary ancestry and the organization of the northern cod AFGP genes remain to be de? termined. Our current studies on the AFGP gene family of the Arctic cod, Boreogadus saida, show that its AFGPs are also encoded by polyprotein genes, i.e. each gene en? codes a polyprotein precursor of multiple AFGP molecules connected in a series by conserved cleavable spacers (Arg). Ge? nomic library screening statistics and south? ern analyses of nine genomic clones to? gether indicate an AFGP gene family of as many as 128 genes. Many of these genes are closely linked in the genome, some of which are tandemly repeated. This high cod? ing capacity commensurates with the high AFGP protein level necessary for survival in the very northerly geographic ranges of the Arctic cod which includes the Arctic polar basin. The evolutionary origin of the cod AFGP gene remains elusive. We have iso- 1268 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

The objectives of the present study were to investigate the effect of 5-hydrox? ytryptamine (5-HT) on the release of crusta? cean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), and to determine if stress-induced hyperglyce? mia is mediated by 5-HT-enhanced CHH release. Eyestalk ganglia with intact X-or- gan/sinus gland complex were dissected from the crayfish "Procambarus clarkii' and incubated under various experimental con? ditions. The incubation media were then analyzed for the presence of released hy? perglycemic factor using an in vivo bioas? say. The results show that 5-HT enhanced the release of hyperglycemic factor in a dose-dependent manner. The stimulatory effect of 5-HT was significantly decreased by incubating eyestalk ganglia with 5-HT re? ceptor antagonist (ketanserin or methysergide). Activity of the 5-HT-released hyperglycemic factor was reduced by ab? sorption of incubation media with ALPHA- CHH serum, but not by pre-immune or AL- PHA-5-HT serum. Furthermore, acute ther? mal stress (34/C) elicited hyperglycemic responses in animals acclimated to 24/C. The thermal stress-induced hyperglycemia was decreased in reserpine- (a 5-HT depletor) or ketanserin-treated animals. In summary, it is demonstrated that 5-HT en? hances release of CHH that in turns elicits hyperglycemic responses. The 5-HT-en? hanced CHH release is probably involved in stress-induced hyperglycemia.

Osmolytes of shallow-water marine in? vertebrates are usually free amino acids such as glycine, alanine, taurine. Recently we showed that some deep-sea crustaceans and molluscs are dominated by trimethy- lamine oxide, which can offset inhibition by pressure. Echinoderms and gastropods were dominated by scyllo-inositol, whose compatibility properties are unknown. We have continued analysis other deep-sea in? vertebrates, using HPLC. The following analyses note solutes that were 50 mmol/kg or greater, thus providing high osmotic pres? sure. Arm muscles of cirrate octopods (two species) were dominated by betaine (trimethylglycine) and taurine. Body wall and muscles of polychaetes (two species: sea mouse, and Travisia) were dominated by sar- cosine (methylglycine), betaine and scyllo- inositol; and leg muscles of one pycnogonid species contained mainly sarcosine. Methy- lamines may serve as pressure-counteract- ing solutes. To our knowledge sarcosine has not previously been reported at such high levels in any animal.

How carnivo? rous deep-sea ascidians catch their prey. Two new species of carnivorous deep- sea octacnemid ascidians have recently been discovered at bathyal depths in the Bahamas, one in the genus Dicopia and one in the genus Kaikoja. Analysis of gut con? tents indicates that both species consume mostly small crustaceans, though we also observed entrapment of a small fish by Kaikoja sp., the larger of the two. Because these animals have reduced branchial sacs and lack ciliated stigmata, they cannot filter particles like other ascidians. It has been widely assumed in the literature that an octacnemid traps prey like a Venus flytrap plant, closing rapidly on small animals that contact the inside surface of its incurrent siphon. However, video observations from a submersible failed to reveal any instances of food capture by rapid closure; instead, 800-955-1236 ? (703) 790-1745 ?

Most individuals live on vertical rock walls with the expansive incurrent siphon pointed downward and the small excurrent siphon directed upward into the water col? umn. In situ studies with fluorescent dye re? vealed that internal flow is induced by ambi? ent currents in the benthic boundary layer. Passive flow draws prey into the incurrent siphon, where they are unable to escape from reflexed folds of tissue. Once captured, prey are moved to the esophagus by rapid pumping of the body, which is accomplished with strong anterior muscles situated be? tween the siphons. These two octacnemids are more like minnow traps than Venus flytraps.

Early life-history strat? egies of sessile invertebrates in stratified fjords and coastal lagoons. The larvae of sessile marine animals are faced with the difficult challenge of selecting a habitat that will be appropriate for the en? tire adult life. Many processes occurring in the water column prior to settlement help determine whether larvae will have the op- portunity to make an appropriate settlement choice. Most ascidians are stenohaline ma? rine animals that penetrate short distances into water of low or variable salinity. In coastal lagoons of Florida, the diversity of ascidians is high near inlets but decreases rapidly as a function of distance from the inlets. In labo? ratory pycnoclines, larvae of colonial ascid? ians become inactive when swimming into brackish surface layers. This causes them to sink toward the bottom where salinity is high? est. Metamorphosis is delayed or inhibited in brackish water and species that are best able to metamorphose at low salinities are also able to penetrate into brackish portions of the lagoons. In Gullmar Fjord, Sweden, most ascidians are found below the perma- nent pycnocline and few are ever found in brackish "Baltic" water that lies above the pycnocline. Experimental transplants and lab incubations indicate that adults of Ascidiella spp. tolerate brackish water but that low sa- linity inactivates or kills larvae and inhibits metamorphosis. A dense band of Ascidiella aspersa found just below the pycnocline is explained by flotation of embryos and by lar? val responses to the pycnocline layer. The occasional appearance of Ascidiella scabra in shallow water appears to result from short- term mixing events which coincide with times when larvae are present in the water col? umn. In both the fjord and lagoon system, the tolerances and responses of ascidians to low salinity change with ontogeny, and processes occurring in the embryonic and larval phases help position the adults in ap? propriate salinity regimes.

Crustacean muscles contain four cal? cium-dependent cysteine proteinases (CDPs or calpains) that differ in mass and subunit composition. These enzymes (CDP I, lla, Ilb, and III) are involved in the degrada? tion of myofibrillar proteins during a pro? grammed atrophy associated with molting. We have begun cloning these genes to ana? lyze their expression in various tissues dur? ing the intermolt cycle. Highly degenerate universal calpain primers were designed based on the homologous amino acid se? quences from multiple alignments of calpains from diverse species. Using nested PCR and inverse PCR, a full-length (1978 bp) lobster calpain gene (Ha-CalpB) was isolated and sequenced from a deep ab? dominal muscle cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence of the polypeptide (about 55 kDa) has high sequence identity to other calpains, particularly the Drosophila Calpain B (Dm-CalpB) gene. Domain I has a unique N-terminal sequence of about 230 bp; domain II consists of a highly-conserved cysteine protease sequence; and domain III contains a unique stretch of 17 aspartates and a highly-conserved Ca2+ -binding re? gion. Ha-CalpB, like Dm-CalpB, lacks a calmodulin-like sequence (Domain IV) found in the ubiquitous m-calpain and jli- calpain in mammals.

We examined the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, from three northern and three southern populations to determine if a latitudinal gradient existed in their thermal tolerance. While many comparative studies among species have demonstrated a robust relationship between thermal tolerance and prevailing temperature at the locality of ori? gin, we found within Wyeomyia smithii no differences in the critical thermal tolerance of mosquito populations spanning 30 to 46 degrees North latitude. This lack of differ? ence in response to acute thermal stress is consistent with earlier studies that found no geographic difference in fitness in these same mosquito populations exposed to chronic lifetime thermal stress. Combined these results support the idea that the adap? tive modification of the thermal response is a slowly evolving process among animals in nature. 67.1 ZELDITCH, M.L*, SHEETS, HD, FINK, W.L., University of Michigan, Ann Ar? bor, Canisius College, Buffalo NY, Univer? sity of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Conservative on? togenetic trajectories: artifacts or data? Most comparative studies support the hypothesis that ontogenetic trajectoriesare historically conservative. The primary basis for this generalization is the typically high correlation between ontogenetic allometric vectors, a measure of their similarity. More than 76% of 233 comparisons yield vector correlations as high as 0.96. However, these correlations are misleading if taken to mean that ontogenetic allometries are highly simi? lar, according to several lines of evidence. Among these are the high correlations ob? tained from biologically absurd comparisons, such as between allometric coefficients of a chimpanzee (based on cranial measure? ments) and a lizard (based on combined cranial and postcranial measurements); this comparison yields a correlation 0.87. Also, correlations between randomly shuffled co? efficients and those based on actual data should yield correlations near 0.0 but instead yield correlations averaging 0.98 or higher. And correlations as high as 0.99 can be obtained by comparing allometric growth vectors to vectors of isometric growth, even when growth is far from isometric. We sus? pect that correlations between ontogenetic allometric vectors may be high merely be? cause most taxa enlarge as they grow. When enlargement is removed from consideration, using geometric morphometrics, biologically absurd comparisons yield correlations near 0.0, as they should. And taxa that seem highly conservative in their allometries, based on traditional measurements, reveal consider? able repatterning of relative growth rates. 42.4 ZEPNEWSKI, E.*, NISHIKAWA, K, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff. Con? nective tissue in ballistic tongues. Nerve transection experiments of the main tongue protractor muscle showed dif? ferences in feeding behavior between Rana pipiens and Bufo woodhousii. Bufo woodhousii shows a reduction in tongue protraction length without directional devia? tion. The tongueof R. pipiens, while also showing a reduction in extension, deviates toward the intact side. We hypothesize that the differences in behavioral responses are due to the amount and orientation of epimysial connective tissue surrounding the protractor muscle. Total amounts of collagen and elastin were measured for both spe? cies. Polarized light microscopy was used to measure the orientation angle of the col? lagen fibers surrounding the protractor muscle. Bufo woodhousii showed less con? nective tissue and fiber angles greater than 54?44 which facilitates elongation. The tongue of R. pipiens contains greater amounts of connective tissue and fiber angles less than 54?44' which resists elon? gation. This fact, combined with the loss of 800-955-1236 ?

Previ? ous studies have also shown Megophrys montana to be an inertial elongator. Based on normal feeding, we hypothesize collagen fiber angles in this species to also exceed 54? 44 yet be less than B. woodhousii. Megophrys montana may represent an in? termediate between R. pipiens and B. woodhousii. Results from this study may have interesting evolutionary and ecologi? cal implications perhaps showing conver? gent evolution between distantly related taxa.

The sea urchin sperm protein bindin is the principal component of the acrosomal vesicle and is involved in sperm-egg recog? nition and sperm-egg fusion. Bindin is not homologous to any known non-echinoid protein. Bindin is only known from several genera of regular echinoids. We have cloned mature bindin sequences from a range of other echinoids including a sand dollar (Encope stokesi), a heart urchin (Moira atropos), a diadematoid (Diadema antillarum), and a pencil urchin (Eucidaris tribuloides). The core region of bindin, which is involved in sperm-egg fusion, is extremely conserved. The regions flanking the core, which are involved in species-specific sperm-egg recognition, are remarkably di? vergent. These results indicate that the bindin molecule has been conserved in the echinoids for over 250 million years. P2.75 ZIMMERMAN, B.B. * TOBALSKE, B. W, Univ. of Portland, OR. Effect of flight distance on take-off mechanics in zebra finch. Flap-bounding is a flight style that is ex? pected to offer an aerodynamic advantage over continuous flapping at fast flight speeds but not during hovering or slow flight. There? fore, we hypothesized that birds that exclu? sively flap-bound should maximize take-off velocity to avoid slow flight speeds, regard? less of target flight distance. To test this pre? diction, we studied take-off in zebra finch (Taenopygia guttata, n = 6), a small flap- bounding species (14.8 g), as they flew dis- tances from 2 to 10 m within a variable-length flight corridor. Horizontal and vertical ground reaction forces were obtained (5000 Hz) from a machined, instrumented, force perch, and synchronized high-speed video (1000 Hz) was used to measure wing and body kinematics. Generally consistent with our hypothesis, flight distance did not have a significant effect on the majority of the vari? ables examined. However, as flight distance increased, horizontal velocity at the end of the jumping phase of take-off increased, and vertical velocity decreased. The percent con? tribution of leg thrust to horizontal velocity at the end of the jumping phase of takeoff also decreased significantly with an increase in target flight distance. Thus, the wings con? tributed proportionally more to take-off ve? locity as the target flight distance increased. Overall, average horizontal flight velocity at the end of take-off was 2.0 m/s. The mini? mum speed for which flap-bounding is pre? dicted to be aerodynamically advantageous to a zebra finch is 6.0 m/s; clearly, a zebra finch must use additional wingbeats after take-off to reach this velocity.

Variation in brook stickleback (Cuiaea inconstans) size and shape associated with different predator communities. The present study explores the associa? tion of morphological traits of brook stickle? backs (Cuiaea inconstans) with two types of predator communities. Stickleback popula? tions associated with these predator com? munities differ in the size at which they are vulnerable to predation. My comparison of brook stickleback morphology involves 25 populations in three adjacent river basins in Michigan's upper peninsula. I hypothesize that morphological variation among brook stickleback populations can be explained, in part, by different predation pressures. To address my hypothesis, I compare age struc? ture and two aspects of morphology, size and shape, among brook stickleback popu? lations coexisting with each type of predator community. The results suggest that popula? tions vulnerable to predation as adults have shorter-lived and smaller individuals than 1272 SICB ? 1313 Dolley Madison Blvd. ? Suite 402 ?

Both mean and age-spe- cific body size differ among populations as? sociated with the two types of predator com? munities suggesting that predators affect both growth rate and longevity of stickleback popu? lations. In addition, populations that are vul? nerable to adult predation have more fusiform individuals with more caudally placed fins than those vulnerable to juvenile predation only. The results support the idea that mor? phological variation among brook stickleback populations can be explained, in part, by predator-prey interactions within each com? munity. Future work will investigate how on? togenetic investment in growth and shape differs among brook stickleback populations associated with different predator communi? ties.

A previous study showed that removal of the eyes did not alter the stimulatory effect of a long (e.g., LD 14:10) photoperiod on the reproductive response of female Japanese quail. The reproductive response to long pho- toperiods in the blind quail was mediated by extraretinal photoreceptors. The current study was designed to test the role of the eyes and pineal in the reproductive response to photo? periods near the "critical" photoperiod; that is, the minimum photoperiod required to drive the reproductive response. In the first experi? ment, birds blinded by eye removal (EX) held in LD 12:12 had a rapid onset of egg-laying while the intact controls did not exhibit egg? laying for up to 110 days. However, EX birds responded to a shortening of the photope? riod by ceasing to lay indicating that they re? mained photoperiodic. In the second experi? ment, groups of birds (intact, EX, pinealectomized, EX+pinealectomized, and optic-nerve-sectioned) were exposed to in? cremental increases of photoperiod by 15 minutes every 10 days, beginning with LD 10:14. Various criteria were assessed to mea? sure the reproductive response including rate of response time to: onset of lay, 50% lay and maximum lay. Optic-nerve-sectioned birds consistently required the shortest photoperi? ods, while pinealectomized birds consistently required the longest photoperiods, for all cri? teria. For some of the criteria EX birds re? quired shorter photoperiods than intact quail. The data indicated that the eyes are involved in measurement of critical photoperiod and that interrupting the neural output (optic- nerve-section birds) had a different effect than removal of both hormonal (melatonin?) and neural outputs (EX birds). 800-955-1236 ?
