(Itsabook, NY: Pub Pubs, 2001.) 3,126 paragraphs, lots of white space, many pictures, cover.* When the Cows Come Home traces changes in the design of barns from the eighteenth century forward, paying special attention to ethnicity (both of barn builders and cows) and how design of the interior space of barns af- fected bovine sociability (the interactions among cows, both inside and out- side barns), the control of cows by their human "owners," and the interaction of cows and other non-human animals (cats, horses, flies). Yet the book does much more than the title suggests. The great strength of this innovative book * This book does not exist, although perhaps it might.

Blank begins with the pre-history of bovine space - the period of "space- lessness" before barns and enclosures. Cows lived in the homes of their "owners" as equals and respected members of families. Indeed, intimate rela- tions between cows and humans were not unusual, remarkable, or proscribed. Cows grazed in open fields on the mixed grasses of their choice; they created a cow cuisine and famous cow "chefs" (the ensilage of "Emril"). They de- veloped rituals (pitchfork jumping), athletic contests (leaping troughs), and festivals, such as barn dances, that celebrated freedom and expressed the dream of a world without flies. While the concept of spacelessness is some- what problematic and undertheorized - Does enclosure make space? - and perhaps borrows too uncritically from Katie Mice's Making Fences, Blank cap- tures the heady days before the enclosure movement. Enclosure meant not only fences and a restricted diet but also a new asser- tion of "ownership" (rather than family relation) between humans and cattle. Cows were branded and forced to wear bells, marks of their new, degraded status. Yet, the memory of spacelessness lingered, even after enclosure was ac- complished, and was captured in songs, poetry, and skits. Memory was both transmitted and transformed by bovine public displays and festivals, espe- cially in cities, during the early nineteenth century. Blank deftly shows the ways in which cows inverted the apparent symbols of degradation that marked them as "Other" and elaborated a vibrant public culture in early-nineteenth-century cities. She analyzes the tradition of cow (worker) resistance, especially in the workers' world of cow cafes and steer saloons with their free-flowing conversation under the influence of intoxicat- ing liquids (made from fermented silage and hop-hay concoctions) in resis- tance to the constant demands of industrial milking. Blank restores meaning to the stirring (slurring?) slogan of the movement, "Twenty-three hours for what we will." She reinterprets the tales of the "Maze the Moo Cows Made," with Old Lize and the B'hoy Bovines, who strolled down the boulevards of the Bowry, at ease with themselves and at odds with the human world. Most cows were and are chapel, not church; there is a link between cow religion and resistance to Protestant capitalism, which gave not an inch to their tradi- tional religious practices, not even allowing them ritual release on the cattle sabbath.</page><page sequence="3">Book Forum 611 In perhaps her most creative chapter, Blank shows that cows actually turned bells and brands to their own purposes. Cows avidly competed with each other to wear the loudest bells, some so burdened that they could scarcely lift their heads. The noise of the bells annoyed urban human residents, espe- cially the Irish, who complained to city authorities in mid-nineteenth-century New York to no avail. When some took the law into their own hands and at- tempted to strip the cows of their bells, a riot ensued. Led by Herefords, the cows stampeded, making stalls and glue factories their special targets. Blank also brings to light the now-forgotten tradition of cowpunching, which has been confused with the western habit of branding cows (naming the Other). Cowpunching was actually a traditional sport among cows, a parallel to the cockfighting that originated among roosters and was only later translated in human terms, as if the betting and the watching were the real sport. For long ages, humans had been merely spectators to the ritual conflict of cows strik- ing each other in homage to the great deity of cattledom. Every spring, large gangs of cattle fought each other in the streets to prove their bullhood and take their place among the cow political machine. Indeed, Bovine Boxing was the dream of every B'hoy in the Bowry. This was, from one angle, the second golden age of cow culture, which Blank traces to the existence of free bovine urban space. Cows learned their freedom in rather undifferentiated barn spaces, where they mingled openly with horses, pigs, dogs, cats, and chickens. The introduction of Holsteins, the skilled workers of the species, brought the articulation of the heretofore largely organic bovine ideology. Striving for respectability, Holsteins sneered at the Old Lize and the B'hoy ("neither milk nor meat") and saved their money to buy the finest quality bedding for their stalls. Yet, these aristocratic bovines were the most radical of their species. Only a systematic breeding program (erasing all traces of "Old Red," a 48er, from the bloodline) managed to put down their movement for open barns, cats assigned to every half-dozen cows to remove mice and chase flies, and free choice in breeding. The end of urban bovine space and the Holsteins' "pan-bovine" movement came with the ban- ning of cows from cities as an alleged "public health" measure. Yet early industrialization (symbolized by stalls and regulated by seg- mentation and segregation) was not simply imposed on bovines. Where some scholars might have seen simple victimization, as old cows, once the object of respect and veneration among the species, were torn from their surroundings, deprived of physical comforts, and sent to Coach's or Elmer's for a "second</page><page sequence="4">612 Social Science History career," according to industrial logic, Blank finds bovine agency. Segregation, she finds, produced a feminist consciousness among cows. The move toward dairy industrialization had less to do with the logic of profit than the effort of farmers to crush the feminist wisdom of the old cows, which was beginning, through the influence of the cows on milkmaids, to reshape farm families. Gender-conscious cows opened rescue homes for their "sisters" who other- wise might have gone on to become expensive handbags. Blank does not deal squarely with the issue of whether bovine sisterhood extended to promiscu- ous cows and Guernseys. Within these limits, these cows supported a fairly radical form of equality and argued against greater rewards for the most pro- lific milkers. They derided champion milkers as "cash cows." In a famous episode at an agricultural fair in Vermont in 1871, old cows totally disrupted the handing out of ribbons. While the cows did not actually burn the ribbons, as legend has it, they did nudge them into a ditch. Some of Blank's most remarkable insights come from her analysis of how cows were constituted and reconstituted in language. "Cow-boys" was a phrase that originated in the period of spacelessness and referred to the inti- mate relations between some men and cows. Although such relations were later deemed taboo, they reemerged in the nineteenth-century West. Human memory of these connections can be seen in a number of ugly forms, includ- ing the hate crime of cow-tipping and the popular expression "to have a cow," and, more ominously, in the complete control by humans of bovine sexu- ality through commercial sperm banks. In her chilling analysis of butcher- shop charts, she shows how steers were mutilated, erased, and reembodied for human consumption and memory as renamed, euphemistic parts such as "London broil." "Cowpokes" originally referred not to humans but to cattle that engaged in a sitdown strike on the Chisom Trail. Finally, Blank's sugges- tion that rise of the patriarchal family was linked to the subordination of cows (as cows were relegated to barns, women were confined to the home) deserves further attention. This book is not without flaws. Despite Blank's thorough analysis of gen- der and cow culture, she often conflates cows, steers, and cattle, and too often she relies on the seemingly gender-neutral "bovine" when the subject calls for a gendered analysis. She also inexplicably ignores the cow suffrage move- ment and the unwillingness of woman (human) suffragists to march with cows, claiming that deposits of cow dung would hurt their chances with urban</page><page sequence="5">Book Forum 613 middle-class voters. Still, the book's ringing conclusion, "Raising the History of Cross-Species Subaltern Studies from the Barn Floor," outlines Blank's agenda for the theoretical future of the analysis of public space that "ex- plodes the boundaries between barn and yard, fish and fowl, and the 'natural' and 'prefabricated' environment," and points the way toward a truly "new" history. - Darcy Chopwhittle, author of Base on (Steer) Balls: Bovines and Baseball in Brooklyn RESPONSE TO REVIEW: Bovine History and the Linguistic Left Turn By Lars Mooson Taleglad, Institute for Automated Social Research The publication of Philinda Blank's When the Cows Come Home and Chop- whittle's Base on (Steer) Balls points to a disturbing trend in historical scholar- ship. Postmodernists such as Blank (and I should add her colleagues Empty and Null) have claimed to have discovered a whole new field for historical re- search and an entirely new set of actors. Their work, they say, will once and for all end the species-centrism that has "mauled all efforts at constructing a truly inclusive and democratic history." Their claim, however, only demon- strates their lack of social science training, not to mention reading. Without having run a single regression on any data set, Blank asserts that she has found evidence of various (naturally Left-leaning) bovine social movements created by a thriving "cow-munity" (like "udder/ance," one of Blank's many viola- tions of the language in this jargon-laden book). There are simply no data that support that assertion. It is politically driven history of the worst sort. Meanwhile, Blank ignores the true bovine history - and the real, decades- old effort to write the history of animals done by social scientific historians. The Journal of Damn Few Articles has published (and this only covers recent issues) studies of how dairy cows in mid-nineteenth-century Lotsaluck, New York, produced more milk when "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God" was sung to them, patterns of cow migration in fifteenth-century Tuscany in compara- tive perspective, a cross-cultural comparison of bovine suicide rates in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and mortality and fertility rates of cows</page><page sequence="6">614 Social Science History from 1880 to 1930 that draws on the massive Bovine Use Sample (BUS) of the agricultural census constructed at the University of Minnesota, Bigfoot. The efforts of anthropometric historians (whom Blank repeatedly refers to as "anthropomorphic") to chart the standard of living among cows, which went up precisely at the moment Blank argues that cow culture was being crushed and industrial discipline asserted, Blank dismisses as pseudoscientific hog- wash funded by the dairy industry. Social scientific historians have taken the lead in cross-species history: with few human actors, it wasn't difficult to include non-human non-actors. Rational choice models apply equally well to animals as to humans. The politi- cal posturing and sad lack of rigor of Blank and her ilk stand as another ex- ample of how historical scholarship has been put out to pasture.</page></plain_text>
