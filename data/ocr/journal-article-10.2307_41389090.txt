<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Mirror of Technology Martin Schwab I Reassessing Ourselves and Our Inventions The four essays of M. Brewer, K. Hayles, K. Poenicke, and G. Schwab belong to a genre whose rules are not specified. They are efforts to reassess traditional topics such as man, literature, and society in the light of recent scientific or technological innova- tions. From these inventions they abstract three models - the cybernetic organism, the paradigm of information (in the sense of information theory), and the ecological system. Which atti- tudes do the authors take towards the new discoveries and the traditional objects? Are the innovations used as models for man, art, or society and serve to reinterpret them? Or, at the other extreme, are the new discoveries alien bodies in our familiar human world, a threat to human possibilities, to mankind itself? How different are these models from the conceptions we now have of ourselves, of our collectivities, and our artistic produc- tions? Through their self-involvement in the process they evalu- ate the papers are not just neutral reflections on pieces of literary and critical discourse. They also repeat characteristic tendencies of the fields on which they reflect. Together with their objects they belong to the larger hermeneutic endeavor of human self- interpretation and of interpretive appropriation of the unfamil- iar, and, of course, of coming to grips with problems these inven-</page><page sequence="2">86 Discourse 9 tions have engendered, not the smallest of which is the threat of nuclear disaster. When a scientific or technological innovation like the ma- chine or the computer changes our lives, it may also strike our imagination as a possible model for other things, maybe our- selves. Self-centered as we are, we will begin by redefining our- selves with respect to the innovation. Two polar attitudes prevail in these redefinitions. We will either, in an act of identification, interpret the familiar - man, literature, society - through the new medium, or draw a sharp line between the two. In the past the figure of "L'homme machine " (LaMettrie) has had to serve both purposes. But another choice must be made as well, this time on the side of the new item. For we need a concept of the new object - of the machine or cybernetic organism, of the ecological system, of information. This concept will be used in the interpretation. As concerns the new item we can either stress similarity by casting its concept in terms close to familiar models. Anthropomorphic conceptions of the machine are an example which also shows the contrast with respect to "Mechanical Man." But we can also stress difference by removing the new object into the distance of the utterly unfamiliar. Three attitudes typical of the "technological imagination" combine the choices just mentioned. A very common attitude defends a traditional model of man against changes rooted in innovations. So strong is the defensive reflex that it may choose to present the new as remote and ugly, but the old as homey and beautiful. Thus, it affirms a traditional image of man and projec- tively rejects the new model along the lines: we are what we always have been, surely not machines, computers, or cybernetic organisms. Another attitude identifies man with the new model while insisting on the radical gap which separates the new and the inherited models. This attitude amounts to the statement: a new form of man is born, be s/he monstrous or superhuman. A third attitude operates with a greater degree of flexibility on both terms of the interpretation. Its model of the new item is not too far removed from the traditional understanding of man, litera- ture, or society. But it simultaneously redefines the familiar item in terms of the new model. The new model is thus able to accom- modate traditional human features, albeit in a transliterated form. This attitude is, of course, less clear-cut than the two pre- vious ones. It does not first stabilize one of the variables and then move on to organize the other variables accordingly. This may be</page><page sequence="3">Spring-Summer 1987 87 the reason why it is less common than are the other two. Its message is: we are changing, and so are our self-interpretations. My analyses will strongly rely on one particular issue which runs through all the four essays I am responding to. I find it highly significant that so many of the reinterpretations and the- ses put forward in these essays can be coined in terms of holism, more generally in terms of real and conceptual changes concern- ing parts, wholes, and their mutual relations. Holism will help to illustrate how the new paradigms really go beyond the models we already possess. The innovative power of a new conceptual mod- el is much more difficult to demonstrate than the originality of the inventions from which it is derived; for whatever innovative potential the new concept might have, it has to pass the test of a comparison with traditional models, in this case with both the organicist and the mechanistic conceptions, for semiotic innova- tion, of comparisons with established theories of meaning. If, for example, a cyborg is nothing more than a machine in the tradi- tional sense then it will not have an innovative role to play. If, therefore, the new models do not possess conceptual originality, then they will neither be able to serve as media for new nor as opposites to old self-interpretations. I think that holism is not only an underlying conception in all the papers, but that it is also new in escaping the old opposition between organicist holism and mechanicist anti-holism. il The Emancipation of the Element , Serial Wholes Organicist holism has asserted the primacy of the whole over its parts or elements. Exact doubles are impossible. Parts do not have a meaning of their own, but receive significance from the unique whole to which they belong. In short, the whole logically precedes, is greater or other than the aggregate of its parts. A certain structuralism has gone even further by asserting that the whole generates its elements. The mind, the individual body, the social body, and the work of art are but four examples of items which have persistently been conceived as organisms in the sense of organicist holism. Nature has also been interpreted holistically, but few scientists today accept Paracelsus's idea of a motherly Earth, a living organism generating in her body substances which constitute that body. Lacking a holistic counterconcept the anti- organicist opposition could do little else but deny altogether the</page><page sequence="4">88 Discourse 9 very existence of wholes. But recent genetic engineering generates wholes from parts and reverses the old hierarchy in the field of life where it was most deeply entrenched. If, to use the example G. Schwab has adapted from Woody Allen, a president can be reconstructed from his nose alone, then the part contains the whole - in the form of (genetic) information, to be used as a blueprint for the production of the whole. These parts have representational inde- pendence from, indeed even supremacy over, the whole. Wholes, on the other hand, are no longer unique specimens, for identical specimens can in principle be multiplied and reconstituted ad libitum without being exposed to the hazards of biological repro- duction. Extensions of the procedure are easily imagined. If, for example, the same principle of multiplication could also be ap- plied to acquired traits like character and memory, then we would even find separate individuals who share parts of their life histor- ies, memories, and feelings. If, in addition, transplantation and assemblage of organic parts became generally available tech- niques, then the individual whole would lose another of its pre- rogatives. It would no longer be a unit whose identity is brought about in the process of a life history, slowly and unintentionally emerging from and evolving over time. Generalized clonage, software reproduction, and transplantation technology would altogether confer to the whole the new status of an artifact, to be assembled and transformed at will. The ideas of life and death, but also of lineage, so closely linked to the idea of individual persons or works, would lose much of their importance. What a specific individual is would no longer depend on the specific place it holds among its predecessors and successors, or on the specific experiences which shape it. The significance of genea- logical history would recede. Multi-dimensional, functional sys- tems of order like personality profiles and fingerprint retrieval programs would replace history as primary means of identifica- tion. Not where an item comes from, but what elements it is combined of, and how it functions, both internally and in its environment, would become the pieces of information most rele- vant for its identity. Similarly, the desirability of combinations would be a major factor in the choices to be made in self-fashion- ing or education. Just imagine the advantages of copying math- ematical or other skills into brains without having to go through the tedious and costly educational procedures of our days. Of course, the details of these changes are still more a Utopian dream than a social reality, and may therefore serve as indicators</page><page sequence="5">Spring-Summer 1987 89 of present pathologies, fantasies of total control and of immortal- ity. But, as fantasies often do, they also highlight features of a given situation by presenting a contrasting scenario. The tradi- tional concept of interpretation, for instance, with its assumption of an anticipated understanding of the whole as a prerequisite for the understanding of a part would be obsolete in an environ- ment which has undergone the radical transformations just sketched. At this point, a quick glimpse at intertextuality may be in- structive because it sheds additional light on the biological fanta- sy and offers insights into the literary work as well. Is not inter- textuality to texts what clonage and transplantation are to organisms? Indeed, the analogy is so powerful that it is also treacherous. The biological fantasy may therefore also be in- voked as a corrective to literary theory. First of all, the example of biology suggests that the changed status of parts does not dispense with the question of the whole. On the contrary: parts will be integrated into wholes in new ways. When the parts emancipate themselves from the domination of the whole, then the whole will have to adopt new modes of integration. The mobile organ, for instance, still needs to be implanted into a new host body if it is to achieve the autonomy and functional significance which it previously had. Medicine has to change the previous mode of integration in overcoming the barrier of the immune system. The grafted text receives meaning from and in its new context in a similar manner. In both cases, it remains possible, and may even become necessary, to know how the graft is integrated into a whole in which it functions. Secondly, the comparison with biology quickly shows how different textual and organic parts behave. While it is true that in both worlds internal and external relationships are as little exclu- sive of each other as are a paradigmatic and syntagmatic, a struc- tural and a genetic perspective, the relations between the gener- ating and the generated item are different in each case. Transplantation moves a specific organ from one body to an- other. The transplant will be either here or there. But in the case of texts the donor text does not lose the textual element it comes to share with the new text. Rather, the original textual element is duplicated and the older text becomes the ancestor of the newer text. The grafted piece itself, on the other hand, derives from the operation an autonomy which it did not formerly possess. K. Hayles emphasizes this. For the part is now a textual element which is "the same" in each text. The fact that each text thus has a</page><page sequence="6">90 Discourse 9 "window" into another text gives a special significance to the textual part which serves as the link. There will now be both an inside and an outside relation between the two texts, they simulta- neously exist as separate and as integrated entities. For this rea- son it is inadequate to see the transformation as a transition from two separate to one single textual entity, producing Siamese twins or Russian dolls in a doll. It would appear to me that the concep- tual tools of communication are best suited to articulate the very complex relations of intertextuality, because they allow for exact- ly that simultaneity of internal and external relations which turn out to be essential in intertextuality. The grafted textual element functions as a medium of communication in an exchange be- tween the two texts which synthesizes them into a more complex unit without fusing them. A grafting operation changes both texts, internally and externally, without abolishing them as units. Finally, the analogy between biology and textuality turns into mere contrast when the problem of memory is raised. Genetic memory is ahistorical, it does not, as Lacan has pointed out, "remember." For all we know, events which have taken place at a previous location do not leave their traces in genetic memory, traces which they then transport to a new location. Take the clone, for example. The clone "forgets" its ancestors. The life history of its particular source organism has no behavioral conse- quences for the clone. The clone only forms series and classes together with its ancestors and successors. Thus, it is not an "archive" in M. Brewer's and Derrida's sense. Textual elements, on the other hand, perform the task of remembering when they function intertextually, as Bakhtin and Walter Benjamin have stressed. Unlike the biological clone the textual fragment remem- orates, not only repeats, its other uses in the host text. These other uses are presented, but not necessarily enacted. And the textual graft confers a new intentionality to its previous uses. The intertextual element represents that other use in the host text, establishes a genealogy, and most importantly: it acts as vehicle to the dialogue between texts, often even between authors. Per- haps in opposition to K. Hayles I do not see how the information- al autonomy of the textual element has abolished this function of memory and of communication. And while it is true that we do not possess "a stable, universal context for our texts," it may be equally true that there has never been such a context. Let me return to the new holism after this excursion into literary theory. Two main features of such a holism have emerged from the Utopian figure of the cybernetic organism: an</page><page sequence="7">Spring-Summer 1987 91 emancipated element and a serial whole. Together, they offer an intriguing matrix for our understanding of man and literature, a matrix which has not yet evolved into an adequate model, at least not in its present form. Not surprising, then, that, as G. Schwab points out, literary fantasies of cyborgs and related beings have tended to be highly ambivalent. On the one hand, they present us with beings liberated from the bonds of identity, and capable of freely arranging themselves in patterns undone as easily as en- tered into. This is the positive version of the technological utopia: a new kind of being is born. So much lighter, so much more volatile, is it not above the possibilities of present man? The negative version sees things differently. To it, the very same being appears as monstrous. Uniqueness is lost, individual life and death become insignificant, and character, even in its most crook- ed form a manifestation of individuality, vanishes. What happens to the privacy of my most intimate memories when software duplication transfers them to a complete stranger by making them his or her intimate memories as well? But would it not be interesting to discover that I have an intertextual relation to a stranger? K. Hayles mentions conditions in which our body be- comes an intertext. As I said at the outset, the Utopian and dystopian visions are also moves in an ongoing game in which the present, and only more indirectly the future, image of man is at stake. in Disjecta Membra f K. Hayles applies the cybernetic imagination not to the sub- ject but to the literary text. She perceives a break more radical even than the gap between the humanists' man and the biologists' cyborg. Once the informational paradigm becomes dominant then, according to K. Hayles, the organizing and contextualizing power of meaning is lost in favor of decontextualized bits of information: "The first, and perhaps the most crucial, move was to separate text from context." In terms of parts and wholes: the representatives of holism in the text - the work, the chapter, the character, but also the book, the author, the genre - they all lose their integrative power over the matter they are supposed to organize. In their place we find not just emancipated elements differently integrated. Instead, we are confronted with the chaos of bits of information either randomly distributed or organized</page><page sequence="8">92 Discourse 9 by a perlocutionary will. Organic unity and internal form are no more. They have been replaced by the power of "context con- trol." I wonder, however, whether the concept of information is not overburdened by this interpretation. What exactly does the decontextualization consist in? Prima facie , the decisive innova- tion is indeed achieved by defining the informational content of a message without recourse to the context of that message. But this is far from a general break with all context. For while informa- tional content may be neutral with respect to its textual environ- ment, the same need not be true of the use made of information. "MacKay defined the information content of a message as the change it makes in the recipient's conditional readiness to act." The system which receives a message and transforms it into a reaction not only has but also is such a context. From the system's point of view, a piece of information is always contextualized. More generally, then, to loosen the strong contextual ties of one type of order does not imply the disappearance of other contex- tual relations like analogy, contrast, purpose, function, motive, consequences, recursiveness. In the case of literature, therefore, the disappearance of a narrative structure generating the mean- ing of narrated events does not prevent the emergence of new contexts. Wagner or Mallarmé, for example, have replaced the traditional grand form by multidimensional, modulatory, and highly formal orders. These orders in turn contextualize their aesthetic "signals." It seems to me debatable whether the increasing "emancipa- tion" of textual elements from one type of context and one mode of integration indicates the chaotic sovereignty of an elemental entity which will fall prey to whoever seizes power over it, or whether it simply coincides with the emergence of new orders which may still await explication. (The question of power will, of course, have to be asked again for the new orders, as M. Brewer has argued in her contribution). I add a more general observation which does not apply to K. Hayles's essay. A tradition of cultural criticism extending from Romanticism to the Frankfurt School has acclaimed or regretted the dissolution of classical grand form and interprets the phe- nomenon as a transition from connectedness to disconnected- ness, from teleology to randomness. To me, this position appears as an example for the projective defense of a traditional image of art, one of the attitudes introduced at the beginning of this essay. The defense is carried out in two steps. First, a phenomenon,</page><page sequence="9">Spring-Summer 1987 93 here the technologically induced transformation of literary texts and literary theory, is interpreted in terms of strong alterity. But this step only prepares a second step which declares the phenom- enon to be an alienating event or a sign of decay. (K. Hayles takes the first, but not the second step). From there, one will go on to either state and regret the historical fait accompli or oppose a deviation caused by the forces of alienation. Post-Nietzschean positions, exemplified for instance by Lyotard, which interpret the same phenomenon in terms of a liberation from the con- straints of order seem to me to differ from the conservative cultural criticism mainly by reversing the evaluation. They see liberation where its opponents perceive alienation. But in all these instances the exact nature of the transformation and the chances to participate in its course are lost in the global perspec- tive of a struggle between the forces of order and of chaos. From a slightly different perspective, however, K. Hayles points to a development which I think is extremely important. She shows how the theoretical options of information theory form a technologically inspired conceptual policy. Scientific and technological reasons have led to the analytic separation of infor- mation and meaning. The new conceptual policy allows informa- tion to be stable in very different textual environments, to be transferred from one context to another (sometimes with the intertextual consequences I have sketched above) or to be used for variable purposes. Information can be identical in different contexts but make a difference in otherwise equal contexts. This relative independence of the piece of information qua information is analogous to the representational independence of the part of an organism emphasized by G. Schwab, and K. Hayles cites genetic information as a case of applied information theory. The parallel does indeed hold - up to a point. But again, its suggestiveness tends to veil how differently information func- tions in the texts of the literary and of the biological body. Let me therefore look back to cyborgs for a moment. Information which is not specifically coded to serve as a nucleus from which to reconstruct the greater sequence to which it belongs (for instance in the holographic mode of representation) will not be helpful in reconstructing its context, nor will it generate the system which processes the information. Whoever has lost parts of a text in his computer has experienced this. Information is not defined by its capacity to generate its system, nor does it holistically represent the larger informational sequence of which it forms a part. A cybernetic organism is thus not just a homeostatic system pro-</page><page sequence="10">94 Discourse 9 cessing information selected by the system in order to maintain some target value. Biological cyborgs are distinctive in having a specific kind of information stored in their parts - "genetic" information - which builds and reproduces the system. A pecu- liar pragmatic self-reliance or reflexivity is built into the autopoetic system, and it is this reflexivity which makes cyborgs interesting models for human self-interpretation. The biological model has features which match an important element of our self-interpre- tation as it exists independently from the model. What is the significance of the peculiar and highly increased self-referential- ity of modern literary texts in terms of information theory? Is it not, among other things, a device for generating context? Information theory to which I now return appears to follow a strategy of isolation in its move away from a context which constitutes its meaning. Such "isolationism" - which is a strategy for political scientists - can also be seen in the context of a process of differentiation where a system changes by exchanging one mode of stratification for another. These strategies proceed through decontextualization - which dissolves the bonds of a previous order - to recontextualization in different, perhaps newly generated contexts, with accompanying changes in the contextual relations themselves. Does not the transition from Antiquity to the Christian order, or from the medieval to the modern order demonstrate the simultaneous activity of undoing and reordering forces? From the point of view of a transition from order to order, the historical example of information the- ory appears as an episode in a huge transformation, in which our societies once again shed an old skin as they grow a new one, not, of course, without some bodily changes along the path. Let me end my observations on K. Hayles's essay with a methodological remark. In its original form, information theory does not make totalizing claims. The concept of information is not introduced as a substitute for established concepts of mean- ing. All it claims is that information treated according to this theory can be processed in a certain way, other possibilities not- withstanding. A more current but less cautious reading is very much the child of technological imagination, an imagination that totalizes the theory into paradigm, applies it to other fields, and treats it as, for instance, a general semiotics. Only in its universa- lized version does information theory enter into competition with other theories of Man or meaning; only then does it begin to operate a reduction which denies meaning. Does not the prag- matic attitude of the engineer exhibit a greater degree of per-</page><page sequence="11">Spring-Summer 1987 95 spectivism than the totalizing attitude of the universalizing phi- losopher who transplants his ontological prejudices onto the technological imagination? IV Crazy Compounds or Opposition Inside the Whale M. Brewer and K. Poenicke both focus on the threat of nuclear destruction and ask how literature relates to the threat. In these two contributions the outlook changes in comparison to the two previous essays. While both G. Schwab and K. Hayles apply technological or scientific models to traditional objects in order to reinterpret them or to account for their reinterpretation elsewhere, both M. Brewer and K. Poenicke focus on a situational and behavioral complex. Their picture is different, because it involves a situation in which a political reality, the nuclear threat, is related to a text reacting to and acting towards the nuclear threat. From a methodological point of view, this is a more dy- namic approach. It places literature in an interactive field where literature is neither the passive object nor the sovereign promot- er of changes, but a specific agent among others, partly shaped by the field, partly making a contribution of its own to the events. K. Poenicke follows Bateson in offering an ecological model for our understanding of what went wrong with a humanity drifting towards self-destruction. As he reads "catastrophic writ- ing" human societies are ecological systems preserving their exis- tence and order through internal activity and exchange with an environment. They do this on the basis of structures or orders which they give to themselves. Western civilization, however, has developed a type of order which is susceptible to self-destruction, not only of a particular civilization, but of humanity as a whole. K. Poenicke mentions some of the features he deems responsible for that development. One is that static orders are maintained through violent oppression of forces opposing either them or their stability. Among the techniques of preservation we find paranoid projection, in which the threat from the inside, which is really only a threat to a dominant order, is projected onto an external enemy, interpreted as a threat of total destruction, and not as what it most often is, a factor of change. Another technique is "territorialization," named and conceived after Deleuze and Foucault. An order is territorialized when it follows a pattern of rigorous and exclusive compartmentalization, for instance into</page><page sequence="12">96 Discourse 9 male or female, rational or irrational, white or non-white realms. Objects of territorialization can be bodies of different sorts, the human body, the body politic, or the body of a text. Paranoid projection and territorialization are but two techniques among many, all of which impose restrictions and distortions upon the system as a whole and upon some of its elements. They represent a mode of self-preservation that is based on oppression and feed the illusion that a harmonious commonwealth solely depends on the elimination of the disturbing factors. The model of an ecologically based social criticism is fruitful in many ways. But K. Hayles is right in raising the question on what the countermodel to a destructive order is based. At mo- ments, K. Poenicke seems to suggest that if the oppressed and distorted forces were only given free play and genuine expres- sion they would fall into patterns of a more natural, more dynam- ic, and, ultimately, more satisfying order. I would like to submit that the idea of a natural patterning, a freely entered and sponta- neously entertained order satisfactory to all concerned is an idea of early Liberalism (the invisible hand) or of early Romanticism (the "natural" vs. the rational or historically prevalent order). In both cases there are underlying assumptions, for example about a basic harmony in nature or mankind or the soundness of individual wishes, which we cannot simply take for granted given our present insights into the market mechanism and the ecologi- cal system. Bateson's "schizmogenesis" might, after all, be a ubi- quitous threat, and not just the by-product of a perverse order. A certain ecological imagination all too quickly projects older liber- al and Romantic ideas of our humanistic tradition onto the new models without rethinking them in the new medium. This is a case of an overly optimistic appropriation of a new paradigm. K. Poenicke relates modern and postmodern literary works to the destructive social order. He mentions Melville and Faulk- ner as authors, and interprets Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow and Coover's Baby-Sitter as texts representing an opposition to restric- tive order as well as acting against such orders. They de-territor- ialize, denounce internal and external projection, and, most im- portantly, offer themselves as inhomogeneous, fragmented textual bodies, going as far as to intervene actively in their own narrated world to claim their right to be different and deviant, particularly to be independent from authorially imposed narra- tive order. (It is more interesting to note that K. Hayles sees literature evolve more mimetically and parallel to technology whereas M. Brewer and K. Poenicke see literature more in oppo-</page><page sequence="13">Spring- S ummer 1987 97 sition to technology.) I will now point to some problems of this oppositional reading basing my remarks largely on M. Brewer's essay. The reader should bear in mind that my observations concern an approach which she shares with many others, not the details of her interpretation. M. Brewer's framework is not an ecology of society but a theory of the text conceived in accordance with recent French theories. Social phenomena are essentially textual phenomena as well. It is important to spell out some of the presuppositions of her approach which differ considerably from those of the other essays. Many terms do not have the same meaning they have in the other contributions. Thus, the "nuclear" and the "postmo- dern" are complex events which receive their meaning from a secular trend. The "narrative" of this trend tells us that, for some time already, the intricate web of the traditional Occidental order has begun to give way. In a series of ruptures new, more open forces have surfaced, indomitable to order. Narrative order, stratified society, teleological or even evolutionary history, sub- jects with determined identities (for instance defined by exclusive gender roles) all belong to the old symbolic order, they are allied powers in erecting obstacles to the free play of new oppositional items such as texts, desiring machines, subjects without identity, simulacra, non-hierarchized groups or events resisting represen- tation. In this secular perspective art has become a stake and an instrument in the struggle between conservative and progressive tendencies. Only against this background will it be possible to under- stand the proximity of narrativity and of "the nuclear" in M. Brewer's contribution. Narrativity is presented as an ordering which itself presupposes a deregulation of some kind, an acci- dent. It is a strategy to integrate the break into the order: "The hiatus of the accident procures a break and discontinuity in the narrative, a foundation on which to reestablish identity, time, memory, and continuity." "The nuclear," on the other hand, understood generally as a threat of total annihilation, not only by nuclear war, is only the ultimate consequence of that very same order to which narrativity also belongs. This confers to the nucle- ar narrative, the narrative dealing with the threat of catastrophe, a problematic position. On the one hand, this writing is a speech act directed against the threat. In the performance, however, this speech act has to confront the fact that it may very well contribute to confirm the very same order it is opposing. The model just sketched defines a problem to be solved by each particular work.</page><page sequence="14">98 Discourse 9 It also serves to evaluate the affirmative or oppositional qualities of works. M. Brewer thus draws a distinction between two kinds of nuclear narrative. There are those which, like Pynchon's Grav- ity's Rainbow, Hoban's Riddley Walker , and Johnson's Fiskadero ex- press a groping of the old oedipal order with the catastrophe which is the outcome of its own logic. And there are anoedipal writings, for instance Lessing's Canopus in Argos , Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time , Russ's Female Man , and Atwood's The Hand- maid's Tale which stress difference and discontinuity with respect to the oedipal order by "opening up a different practice of post- nuclear fiction." Let me begin my critical discussion by first assuming with M. Brewer that the nuclear threat is closely tied to the logic of a symbolic order which, among other things, drives nation-states aggressively to assert their identity over others, thereby generat- ing the paranoid fear of the other which fuels the arm's race. Obviously then, if there is no social or political entity to be threat- ened and defended, the very basis of armed conflict among entities of that kind would disappear. Or, to make a less demand- ing requirement, if none of the elements (groups, individuals) of those wholes (nation-states) accepts armed conflict as a means to assert and defend a social identity, then the danger of nuclear conflict also disappears. But how are these social conditions relat- ed to the individual condition of oedipality or to the textual condition of narrativity? The answer may be that both oedipal personalities and narrative self-fashioning are factors favorable to if not necessary for the destructive order. Indeed, do not all these conditions coincide in the societies in which we live? And yet it seems far from obvious that, by overcoming oedipality we would reach a less catastrophic social condition or that oedipality is a decisive factor in the nuclear threat. How do oedipality or narrativity contribute to the threat? The problem of evidence and argument is all the more acute when we encounter tightly knit social formations whose members possess rigid identities in other cultures, too. Some of them are highly aggressive, some are destructive towards other social formations. But not all of them are. Most of them exhibit oedipality and narrative mythology. Similar social "texts" thus seem to differ in their propensity to- wards externally aggressive self-assertion. It seems to me that we have to look for specific differences and for the specific historical conditions of Western Civilization rather than to a general oedi- pality or narrativity underlying the "social text" when we try to find out why our own civilization is the bearer of the nuclear</page><page sequence="15">Spring-Summer 1987 99 threat. The symbolic order, even when it is understood in the specific terms of an oedipal or phallic order, is a feature too general, too ubiquitous, and too far removed from the phenom- enon to offer a good explanation for "the nuclear," at least under present conditions. K. Poenicke faces similar difficulties. They beset a whole tradition of catastrophic thought. I now turn to texts in the narrower sense of literary texts. Both K. Poenicke and M. Brewer confer a special status to fictions whose theme is the nuclear holocaust. They are responses to and oppositional gestures toward the nuclear threat. One of the diffi- culties with this thesis is that we belong to a venerable tradition which uses the fiction of a catastrophe as a narrative vehicle to transport the reader into a Utopian setting. When is a Utopian text merely clearing the screen in order to project an unrelated utopia, and when is it seriously dealing with the catastrophe? How do texts, in fact, how ought they to position themselves with respect to a political catastrophe to which they also relate themati- cally. A mere thematic connection is not enough. A critical pre- sentation of the catastrophe, of its reasons, the sufferings it in- flicts, is not good enough either. The critical presentation may be a mere pretext to derive pleasure from the catastrophe. The problem is further aggravated by the danger of conscious or unconscious complicity with the order supporting the cata- strophic situation. Again, both M. Brewer and K. Poenicke make the same formal move. Complicity can be avoided through the mode of presentation. They even agree upon some of the specific procedures to be employed, although they come to opposite conclusions, for example in the case of Pynchon's Gravity s Rain- bow. The agreement basically concerns features which break with narrative form. In M. Brewer's words these are works which "displace the Oedipal narrative-of-conflict with the system by inventing new forms of non-hierarchical mediation and commu- nity?" With this we turn away from the thematic opposition of a more oedipal and a more anoedipal subject matter. But if "dis- continuity and difference combine to figure the trope of catastro- phe," why is this so? What does a fragmented, multidimensional mode of presentation achieve which a traditional mode of pre- sentation does not achieve? I am not raising the general question of modern art here. My concern is with the particular link which ties certain modes of presentation to an adequate literary re- sponse to the nuclear threat. Why not denounce, by familiar means, the logic and the attitudes prone to lead to disaster, for instance by using the form of a tragic narrative or of a literature</page><page sequence="16">1 00 Discourse 9 of the absurd? What, if anything, makes the intervention of a postmodern non-narrative form into a catastrophic situation more efficient than a narrative intervention? Presumably be- cause the non-narrative text practices attitudes which if adopted would prevent the catastrophe, whereas a traditional text bases its reception on attitudes which do not have that capacity. This may or may not be so. But the criterion for a more successful interven- tion has now shifted from the illocutionary to the perlocutionary force of the literary speech act. We must therefore have reasons to believe that the anti-nuclear reading experience of the non- narrative text is more prone to spill over into attitudes of every- day life opposed to nuclear war than is the traditional reading experience. Otherwise postmodern nuclear writing would be not less affirmative of its enemy than it supposes its traditional corol- lary of "social criticism" to be. Very little evidence of this sort has been given by anyone I know. It also seems to me that the type of political action which might be capable of diminishing the nucle- ar threat is so far removed from a postmodern reading experi- ence that it would be extremely difficult to build a plausible argument. I cannot help feeling that it is more a deeply held belief about the right to represent one's opposition to the nuclear threat (rooted in a perhaps even deeper belief how one should represent in general) than considerations of "symbolic efficacy" (Lévi-Strauss) which favor the non-narrative over the narrative presentation. This suspicion is further nourished by the specific fact that the breakdown of narrativity antedates our concern with the nuclear threat. As regards "the catastrophic in general," neither has Blanchot convinced me that all writing is inhabited by the disaster, nor has Derrida persuaded me that literature being essentially "archival" is differently threatened by a nuclear catas- trophe than are other forms of expression.1 My conclusion from all this is that it is implausible that works of fiction, or more specifically non-narrative presentations of a nuclear holocaust, stand in a special relation either to catastrophe in general or to the nuclear holocaust in particular, be it a particu- lar vulnerability to or a special capacity to deal with the catastro- phe. I tend to think with Freud: "A time may indeed come when the pictures and statues which we admire to-day will crumble to dust, or a race of men may follow us who no longer understand the works of our poets and thinkers, or a geological epoch may even arrive when all animate life upon the earth ceases; but since the value of all this beauty and perfection is determined only by its significance for our own emotional lives, it has no need to</page><page sequence="17">Spring-Summer 1987 101 survive us and is therefore independent of absolute duration."2 In concluding my discussion of M. Brewer's and K. Poen- icke's essays I take up the thread of parts and wholes once more. Both authors see our present reality as a bad whole, bad because it perpetuates the threat of nuclear destruction. This whole is a very strong adversary to its opponents. The old order may even be strong enough to pull the whole species towards disaster. Opposition comes from parts. At least some of our modern and postmodern literature figures as a rebellious part opposing the bad order of the whole through deviation and fragmentation, like Pinocchio lighting a fire inside the whale in order to be spit out. In an interactive scheme the oppositional role is played by a part which anticipates relations incompatible with the dominant bad order. Both M. Brewer's and K. Poenicke's contributions strengthen the idea of a more autonomous part which has emerged in the discussion of K. Hayles and G. Schwab. Both essays do not deny, however, the strength of the whole. It is remarkable that both base their observations on an antagonism between parts and wholes, in which they would like the part to win against the distorted whole. v Faust Naturalized Nuclear fantasies typically ask questions like: what causes the threat? how do we cope with it? what will the world look like afterwards? A different question, - raised, for instance, by Der- rida in "No Apocalypse, Not Now"3 - not just asked by but to be posed to nuclear writing, is this: what is its function as a fantasy? Why are we, the still living, concerned with the intriguing idea that humankind will have disappeared? An obvious answer pre- sents itself first: we are concerned with our future and want to avoid the catastrophe. The meaning of the fantasy is interven- tion. In intervening, the text also presupposes that the appeal or gesture it makes may eventually be successful. I do not take this intervention lightly, although I think that other media and speech acts of a not-so-literary kind may be more efficient means towards that end. But a will to intervene is not a sufficient expla- nation, let alone justification, for the proliferation and insistence of nuclear writing. Other functions must be involved too. Let me introduce my reflection on possible additional func- tions of the nuclear fantasies by presenting a feature which dis-</page><page sequence="18">1 02 Discourse 9 tinguishes it from other apocalyptic visions. What kind of disaster do we imagine in the nuclear holocaust? When we think that we, all of us and our children, will not be because of a nuclear war, what we contemplate is not suicide, for at least some of the agents we think of would prefer to live instead of dying. Nor is it the idea of a mere accident, at least not in the sense of a disaster caused by external and uncontrollable forces or as an unknown side effect, for some of the agents will have to act willfully, knowing the consequences they bring about. (I am ignoring the possibility of an unintended outbreak of a nuclear war.) But, paradoxically, the notion of genocide does not apply without problems either. To be sure, those who perform necessary actions will or must know that their doings are likely to cause the disappearance of mankind. But, according to a well-known argument, their actions make sense only if mankind survives the holocaust. Neither simply suicide, nor mere accident, but not genocide, either, the nuclear holocaust emerges as an original event which arises from actions within the entity destroyed, and is suffered in an accident-like way by the majority of those involved. If the species is taken as the frame of reference then mankind may involuntarily perish through internally generated intentional activity. Our available concepts for disasters do not quite fit this type of event. To take the perspective of parts and wholes a last time: parts destroy the whole to which they belong - ultimate reversal of the old subjec- tion of the part to the whole. The part has power over the existence of the whole. (The reader will have realized that I have not adopted the thesis that the main agency behind the threat is a bad whole acting independently from the parts and over their heads.) I think that this is a new constellation, markedly different from more traditional apocalyptic visions like invincible diseases, stellar accidents, a universe dying from entropy, or some Strangelove plotting to do away with mankind. What if the functions of the nuclear fantasy here and now were linked to the peculiar character of the imagined event? It would neither merely be the fantasized fulfillment of a collective death-wish nor the anticipated mourning over the death of man- kind, but first and perhaps primarily a means of self-interpreta- tion. The idea that the fantasy of nuclear holocaust affirms a certain image of man has the additional advantage that it de- pends as little on the factual imminence of the catastrophe as did the end of the world for the first Christians. Somewhat surprisingly the new fantasy of a self-inflicted, but involuntary death of the human species shows the features of</page><page sequence="19">Spring-Summer 1987 J03 Design for a robot soldier from Automata by A. Chapuis and E. Droz, Neuchâtel, 1958, p. 387</page><page sequence="20">104 Discourse 9 self-interpretation mentioned at the beginning of this response. For example, it takes affirmative or transformative values. Which of the two values is dominant will depend on the particu- lar cast of the fantasy. On the one hand, the fantasy functions as a Faustian daydream, a self-enhancing interpretation of mankind. At the very moment at which new discoveries tend to narrow the gap between us and our kin in nature, the fantasy comes to our rescue and affirms uniqueness. Could any other species die a sudden and well foreseen death through its own purposeful activity? This is highly unlikely; for not only would that other species have to invent the means to do so, it would also have to create the peculiar institutions that confer the power of destruc- tion on an apparently rational behavior. I wonder whether those who attribute to Western rationality the logic which leads to self- destruction do not unwillingly contribute to that self-enhance- ment when they find the major flaw, ironically, in our most unique achievement. Godlike or devilish, Western rationality re- mains a whole, a self-directive device. I call this attitude affirma- tive because it appropriates the very real nuclear threat in order to project the image of Faustian self-aggrandizement. A non-affirmative attitude takes the opposite direction. It "naturalizes" the threat instead of "humanizing" it. Why not view the advent of centralized nation-states and the nuclear technol- ogy in Western Civilization - two decisive factors in the threat - as evolutionary events not so unlike others in the history of mankind? From this point of view those events appear neither as a logical result nor as a distinctive feature of man, but as historical events, contingent though deeply entrenched traits of Western Culture, not completely absent from other cultures. But from an adaptational point of view, the threat of self- destruction of a species is an evolutionary mistake. (Again I omit a possibility from my discussion: a nuclear catastrophe destroy- ing other species or all life on earth.) If the mistake is rectified, then the species will continue to exist; it is not, then the species is likely to disappear like others before. Evolution loses nothing more and nothing less than a species among species. The idea of a world without mankind is, of course, painful and profoundly saddening to us. (Others might not feel the same way.) But it is not easy to argue that we are so much more valuable than others are, unless we are here with a mission - that we are the represen- tatives of God, Reason, or the organ through which the universe is aware of itself. When this metaphysical position is abandoned our grief about mankind's self-inflicted disappearance reveals</page><page sequence="21">Spring-Summer 1987 105 itself as what it is: self-love or the interest taken in our kind. Nothing is morally wrong with such an interest. We are after all, as Marx put it, "species-beings." But we have now reached a position which carries us beyond Faustian self-affirmation. The nuclear holocaust, the very event which is the object of reflection, gives us reasons to think that our evolution has been mistaken. Lest I be misunderstood: my thesis here is not that the nuclear threat is either mankind's fault or merely a faulty social arrange- ment to be repaired by social engineering. I am at this moment concerned exclusively with the function of th e fantasy, not with the fact of the nuclear threat, not with the causes of and the remedies for the threat. What I do not want to advocate, however, is a "naturalization" of our conception of the threat, a lower profile for man in his "natural" environment. This is an interest to which G. Schwab's cyborg, K. Hayles's decontextualization, M. Brewer's surviving fictions, and K. Poenicke's ecological philos- ophy might subscribe. They all favor a lowering of the bound- aries which set us off from the beings from which we evolved or from the beings which evolved from us.
