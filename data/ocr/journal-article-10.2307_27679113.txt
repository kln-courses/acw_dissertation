<plain_text><page sequence="1">Genesis 1 and 2 Michael Browne The Syllabus of Religious Instruction for Secondary Schools pro vides for a five years course. The course for the first year deals with the History of Salvation, covers the Old and New Testament, the life and teaching of Christ and the foundation of the Church. It begins with the story of creation as described in Genesis, chapters one and two. The text of these chapters is read by pupils in The Coming of the Kingdom, a short Bible; and also in the textbook for the first year course Christ Our Light by J. Buys, S.J., volume one of the series 'Young Christians Today'. All priests and teachers will agree that the first two chapters of Genesis raise very serious problems which have engaged and still engage the minds of biblical exegetes and theologians. These prob lems have been accentuated by non-Catholic writers and have been made by them the basis for a complete rejection of the Genesis account and of the whole doctrine of creation. Their contentions are mainly three. First, that the Genesis story is derived from the myths of the Egyptian and Persian peoples about the origin of the universe. Second, that it is a combination of different versions by different Israelite authors of a period much later than the Mosaic - even as late as the fifth century b.c. Thirdly, that it has been completely disproved by the scientific doctrine of evolution which maintains that all the universe and man himself, both body and soul, have evolved from matter. These problems are not disregarded or concealed from the students of the first year course: they are referred to briefly in Father Buys' Christ Our Light. On page twelve we read : 'Amongst the Hebrews and their neighbours popular accounts of the begin ning of the world were current. ... The early authors of the Bible found these tales useful in describing the origin of the earth, the heavens and the firmament and they used them as they stood or Dr Michael Browne is Bishop of Galway. Formerly Professor of Moral Theology at Maynooth and theology correspondent of The Irish Ecclesiastical Record.</page><page sequence="2">GENESIS 1 AND 2 345 combined them with other sources.' On page fifteen we read : *In the second chapter of Genesis the author, using other stories that were current amongst the people, completes his teaching about man and woman. The fact that these stories show differences in detail from the stories used in the first chapter does not worry the author.' The question of different versions and of the late date of Genesis is referred to again on page ten: 'These messages of God first circulated amongst the people by word of mouth: later they were written down, sometimes by the prophet himself or, more often, by his disciples or even by his successors a long time afterwards.' Evolution is also referred to, very briefly, on page twenty: 'Scientists have discovered many similarities between the body of man and the bodies of certain animals, and these similarities have been strengthened by the discovery of numerous fossils in later years. All this leads us to think that God drew the body of man from an animal line which had developed so far in God's plan that it was capable of receiving the spiritual soul which God had created directly.' The reference to these three questions in the textbook read by first year students has created a serious problem for many teachers. If their pupils seek further information and raise questions for discussion what is the teacher to do? At the age of thirteen pupils are not ready for the full treatment of these questions and where is this treatment to be found, in what textbooks? Theologians will tell the teacher that there are full and adequate answers to the three questions which completely safeguard our Catholic teaching. In regard to the first - that the teaching of Genesis is derived from Egyptian and Persian myths - the fact is that the teaching of Genesis is completely different from these myths. The Babylonian account begins with Apsu and Tiamat, male and female deities, begetting other gods. Apsu is slain by his offspring Ea; Tiamat by Marduk, Ea's son, who is proclaimed chief god and who from the remains of Tiamat fashions the world. In the Egyptian account Atum-Re after being produced from Nun, the waters of Chaos, fertilized himself with his own seed and produced from his mouth air and moisture, the universe and other gods. The teaching of Genesis is in complete contrast to these myths. There is no generation of gods, no male and female gods. Jahweh is the one only God who has always existed and is utterly outside the cosmic process. He is transcendant and before all things. He alone created all things and created freely. All things he created</page><page sequence="3">346 THE FURROW are good. The teaching of Genesis rejects the idea that was to be so dominant in the East, that matter is evil, the product of an evil deity. The teaching of Genesis on the creation of man is com pletely superior to oriental myths. Man is the masterpiece of creation, like to God : woman is created as equal to man. Marriage is instituted by God, one and indissoluble, and it is good. This teaching, so vastly different from oriental mythology, could have come only from divine revelation. Whether that was given to Adam or to Moses we do not know. Catholic exegetes agree that it was transmitted by oral tradition from one generation to another of the Israelite people and that slightly different versions of the tradition were formed which were combined by the inspired writer when the tradition was committed to writing. The essential point of Catholic teaching in Genesis is that it is a divine revelation of religious truths, of these truths which were the basis of the religious life of God's chosen people. It was not concerned with scientific theories of astronomy or biology. The inspired writer spoke in the language and ideas of his time and if his terms are often anthropomorphic that is because it is so diffi cult to speak of God in purely abstract and philosophic language. Do we not still even in the liturgy of the Church use such terms as 'Give ear, O Lord, to our prayers'? In regard to the evolution of man's body, it is necessary to emphasize that it is still a theory, not an established certainty : that it is liable to correction: scientists do not now assert that man's body is directly descended from the ape. The Church does not reject the theory that the body of the first man may have been drawn from an animal line, but she insists that God creates man's soul directly and that all men are descended from one man. These are difficult subjects for boys and girls of the first year of post-primary schools. But if not dealt with then, in what year of the five years course are they to find a place? They are not mentioned again in the syllabus, except that evolution is included among the special topics that may be discussed in the fifth year. At present the first year's course covers practically the whole field of Christian doctrine - the history of salvation, the Old and New Testaments, the life and teaching of Christ, the foundation of the Church. There is much to be said for transferring to the fourth and fifth years the subjects which have a predominant scientific and apologetic content, such as the existence of God, creation, the historicity of the gospels, the basis of morality. Students in these years are more mature and are more sensitive to the difficulties arising from scientific or historical sources.</page></plain_text>
