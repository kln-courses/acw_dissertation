<plain_text><page sequence="1">Letter from Kobe DEAR H, It is just after 0 Shogatsu, Japan's biggest religious holiday that marks the opening of the New Year. For the first three days of the year practically everything in the country shuts down, and most people spend time with their families, either staying in or making pilgrimages to one or more shrines. Prior to the holiday, house- wives are busy cleaning their homes from top to bottom-an equiv- alent of "spring cleaning" in the West-and preparing the elaborate and dainty dishes called 0 sechi-ryori that will be aesthetically ar- ranged according to color and manner of preparation (sweet things, grilled things, simmered things, sour things) in the traditional tri- ple- or quadruple-decker lacquer box, to be eaten during the first three days. The customary pastime on New Year's Eve is not a drunken party but a quiet evening at home, watching a lengthy popular music show on TV. At midnight all over Japan temple bells begin to sound. Small bonfires burn in the courtyards as people step up to take a turn sending a deep gong-like ripple across the night air, one hundred and eight times for good luck. After that, the first bowl of soba of the new year is eaten, and many people stay up the whole night to see the sunrise. On January 1 in the early afternoon I went with friends to two of the biggest shrines in the city of Kobe, Ikuta and Minatagawa. The crowds were enormous, because the "first visit" is extremely signifi- cant. Though not as many as in former days, quite a few women were dressed in the long-sleeved kimono called furisode, somewhat incongruously topped by white feather or fur boas against the chilly air. The shrines in Japan are Shinto, while the temples are Bud- dhist, but the two seem to exist symbiotically. Observing the Shinto rituals of the New Year by no means excludes participation in Bud- dhist rites, or even in Christian observances. There is no religious "service" on New Year's Day; the mass of humanity presses forward toward the large wooden offertory box that stands in front of the shrine. After a clap of the hands and a momentary prayer, the rest of the time is free for picture-taking with the family, buying amu- lets and paper fortunes, or writing your hopes and dreams for the coming year on a wooden plaque and affixing it to a sort of bulletin "wish" board. The paper fortunes are also left behind, tied to trees and bushes. Food and trinket stalls line the walkways up to the shrines and do a brisk business. I tasted tai-yaki, a waffle-like creation shaped like a fish and filled with the sweet red azuki bean paste that is used in so many Japanese confections. Under the green leaves of the camphor</page><page sequence="2">360 THE HUDSON REVIEW trees at Minatagawa Jinja we welcomed in the Year of the Rabbit, the sixty-second year of the Showa Empire. It is my second year in Japan. When I first arrived, shaken by the upheaval of leaving everything familiar behind, I thought I had made a terrible mistake. I landed at Narita airport, outside of To- kyo, and took the connecting shuttle to Osaka the next morning, where I was met by two professors from the women's university where I was going to teach. My first real look at things was from the window of the taxi that we took from Osaka to Kobe. What met my eyes was a steady, unrelieved, colorless jumble of concrete. It was my first exposure to one aspect of Japan's crowdedness, and also to the widespread lack of concern for city planning in any spa- tial or architectural sense, an absence that seems more than a little odd in a culture whose sense of beauty is so highly refined. Statistically, Japan is 1/25th the size of the United States and has about half as many inhabitants. The fact that seventy percent of the terrain is mountainous, however, cuts down the living space consid- erably. Not surprisingly, the care and housing of the country's ag- ing population is a problem that is beginning to reach critical pro- portions. Relocating the retired and elderly to other countries (the U.S., Australia, Brazil) is a plan that has already begun to be imple- mented. Outside of Tokyo, which is in Kanto, the Kansai area where Kobe, Osaka, and Kyoto are located is the most densely populated and also the most affluent. Kobe is the second largest port in Japan, after Yokohama, and is known as a cosmopolitan city because of its mixed population, but I soon learned that of the nearly million and a half residents only slightly more than 38,000 were non-Japanese. Of these, nearly 28,000 are Korean, with Chinese (7,331) and Indi- ans (960) next in line. Europeans and Americans number only in the hundreds and are scarcely visible in the populace at large, albeit more so in Kobe than in most places. Kobe was seriously bombed in World War II and has been rebuilt into a prosperous industrial city. It is long and narrow, bordered on one side by the Rokko Mountains and on the other by the Inland Sea, and these geographical constraints put a limit on urban sprawl, at least north to south. It is considered a nice place to live partly because the climate on the southern coast of the island of Honshu is temperate, while the northern coast (called the Japan Seacoast), the mountain range known as the Japan Alps, and the northernmost island of Hokkaido are subject to extreme cold and heavy snow in winter. Although the temperature drops below freezing in Kobe in the coldest months (December-February) and the wind can be bit- ing, rose, pink, and white camellias continue to bloom, and most houseplants can be left outside. Kyoto is less favorably disposed in terms of climate, being situated in a bowl that traps cold air in win-</page><page sequence="3">362 THE HUDSON REVIEW ter and hot air in summer. Kobe swelters in summer as well; June is the rainy season, and in July and August the heat and humidity are exceedingly uncomfortable. For the first week after my arrival I stayed with my friends Ann and Yoshio Tsuda and their two daughters in their beautiful apart- ment (actually two apartments combined into one) filled with their extraordinary collection of pottery from all over Japan. Behind the large "mansion," as apartment buildings are called here, there is a wooded ravine, somehow miraculously spared from development, through which a small stream runs. I will always remember those first mornings, waking up on my futon, which had been laid on the wheat-colored tatami mats in Ann's room, to the sound of rushing water. I should say waking up in the middle of the night, since I was suffering from jet lag and would nod off and awaken at all hours. Soon enough I was shown the apartment that the university was providing for me. What a shock! It was on the ground floor of a six-story, block-long, concrete building in a danchi, or housing de- velopment, that consisted of thirty-eight identical buildings with large numbers on either end to differentiate them. Mine was num- ber 4. When the people from my school had asked me if I wanted to live "Japanese style" I had said yes, my romantic mind full of graceful wooden structures with sliding doors, and verandas that gave out onto exquisite gardens (I learned later that such houses did indeed still exist, but at a price, of course). Instead I encoun- tered the sort of housing that is a lifelong reality for millions of Japanese people, the "rabbit hutches" that are a source of national chagrin. When the metal door of my apartment clanged shut behind me I felt locked in a tomb. Far more disconcerting than the apartment's lack of amenities, however, was the rest of the culture shock I was experiencing. Naively, I had thought I could transplant myself into a foreign culture-especially westernized, affluent Japan-without much trouble, but I found that I was ill-prepared emotionally for the feeling of being a gaijin, or "outsider," as the Japanese call those not their own. I had never been in the midst of a homogenous race before, let alone one as insular and proud as the Japanese. When I was first beginning to explore Kobe, it gave me a queer sensation to see the crowded buses and trains filled with such remarkably alike- looking people, who shared not only the physical attributes of hair, eye, and skin color, but also dressed and acted alike. A Dutch wom- an I became friends with remarked one day, "When I first got here I thought I had landed on another planet!" In my immediate neighborhood I was surrounded by some 6,000 fellow danchi dwellers. I had not anticipated what it would be like to have no one take the slightest notice of my presence, except for an</page><page sequence="4">ELIZABETH KNIES 363 occasional stare. I was invisible. I had mistakenly thought that since English language study is a required part of the general school cur- riculum, beginning at grade seven and continuing at least through high school and often into college, I would be able to communicate with people, at least minimally, in English. This assumption was ab- solutely incorrect. I rued the fact that I had not found a way to study Japanese before I left home, because my current teaching schedule was not going to permit the kind of intensive study that learning Japanese requires. As luck would have it, I only lived in the danchi for a little over four months. By then I was beginning to have a network of ac- quaintances, and when a small house in another neighborhood be- came available I jumped at the chance to move. The "little house," as I call it, is not the Japanese house of my dreams-it has not an inch of garden or grass, and nary a tree-but the improvement was spectacular nonetheless. The house sits near the top of a long slop- ing hill, close to the mountain. From my study on the second floor I look out across tiled rooftops all the way down to the harbor. Un- fortunately, most days the view is obscured by the thick cloud of pollution that hangs over the port area, but when a brisk wind clears the air somewhat, or at night when the city lights are glitter- ing, it is a pretty outlook. In fact, the "night view" of Kobe, either from the top of Mt. Rokko looking down the sea, or from Port Is- land (a manmade island in the harbor) looking at the city sloping upward, is one of the most celebrated in Japan. Teaching English is what nearly every gaijin does for a living, with the exception of the international businessmen. Since the end of the war English has been the foreign language of choice, and there is an almost limitless demand for teachers, making Japan one of the most attractive places on earth for our expatriates. Every day the newspapers carry ads for "native English speakers" to fill the positions at language schools (one of the lowest paying jobs in the echelon), and every company worth its salt has instituted English classes for its workers. Jobs at colleges and universities are harder to come by, since hiring is done primarily on a who-you-know basis, but only recently have any real academic credentials begun to be required. When I first faced classrooms full of eighteen- and nineteen-year- old Japanese girls I thought I might possibly be going to have a nervous breakdown. There seemed to be an almost schizophrenic dichotomy between the traditional reverence for the sensei, or teach- er, and the students' actual behavior. Granted, many of them had never heard English coming out of the mouth of a native speaker and might have been expected to be cowed by the phenomenon, but that did not make it any less distressing. Any requests for dis- cussion or questions on my part were met with stony silence, yet</page><page sequence="5">364 THE HUDSON REVIEW during the rest of the class an incessant chit-chat (in Japanese) made it nearly impossible to teach. I ricocheted between two equally upsetting thoughts: were the students bored because what was be- ing taught was too easy and did not hold their interest?-or were they bored because it was too hard and they couldn't follow? It was impossible to tell, because no one would say a word. It took me a full term to come to grips with the situation, if in- deed I can claim to have done so. But now, after three terms, I've begun to break through the barriers of reticence and shyness, and I've even made friends with a few girls who are brave enough to approach me outside of class. Since more and more are going abroad for summer programs or homestays or a year of study, I like to think I can help them a little bit. Although in many respects Japanese girls are less inquisitive intellectually, less ambitious pro- fessionally, and less worldly than their American peers, they possess many endearing qualities. In the diaries that my writing classes keep as their homework I catch a glimpse of their concerns, and of their hopes and dreams. To their families and friends (high school and even junior high chums are never forgotten) they bear an in- tense loyalty and tender regard. And, despite the fact that they are all too aware of society's parameters for them as women, some are beginning to push against the cocoon a bit, wanting to venture into a less restricted world. As much as I want them to recognize and claim their equality with men and develop their abilities, I hope that they will be able to keep the gentleness, fidelity, and generosity that are so evident in their emotional makeup. Last June I went to the third kabuki performance of my stay here. The first two were in Tokyo, at the Kabukiza, where I sat spellbound for hours on end, watching this most fantastic of theat- rical genres. In June I went to Kyoto, an easy train ride from Kobe of only a little over an hour, to the Minamiza, to sit in a tatami box in the front of the third tier, facing straight onto the stage. The performance was Yamato Takeru, billed as "super kabuki," directed by and starring Ichikawa Ennosuke, with costumes built by the Issey Miyake studio at a cost of the equivalent of five million dollars. In the realm of kabuki the forty-seven-year-old Ennosuke is a maverick who has dared to stretch the classical restrictions of the form, generating vociferous approval and disapproval for his ex- perimental work. In Yamato Takeru Ennosuke creates a warrior hero of archetypal stature in a story drawn from Japan's ancient history- mythology, the Kojiki. Yamato is one of the old names for Japan, and Yamato Takeru is one of the eighty children of Emperor Keiko, who supposedly lived for a hundred and thirty-seven years. He undertakes a series of larger-than-life adventures, subduing all opponents, human and anthropomorphic, until at last he succumbs to a hailstorm directed at him by an evil mountain god.</page><page sequence="6">ELIZABETH KNIES 365 I have never witnessed anything to compare with Ennosuke's physical virtuosity and awareness of theatrical nuance. He is not a large man, yet throughout the four-hour-long performance the au- dience collectively held their breath while he was onstage whirling and striking, supplicating, making love. Finally he is laid to rest in his tomb. His wife and small child mourn him there, then leave the stage. Everything is still. Then the tomb begins to tremble, molten and glowing. After a long, heart-stopping minute the highest stones fall away. Yamato Takeru steps forth, transformed into a magnifi- cent white bird with shimmering feathers. His chalk white face is expressionless, no longer subject to the play of passion. Very very slowly he begins to fly, through rainbow light, up over the heads of the audience. If I had put out my hand I could have touched him as he passed by. ELIZABETH KNIES</page></plain_text>
