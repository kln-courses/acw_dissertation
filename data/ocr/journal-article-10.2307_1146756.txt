<plain_text><page sequence="1">Presenting and Re-Presenting the Self From Not-Acting to Acting in African Performance Frances Harding What is universal in performance is the consciousness of performance. -Herbert Blau (1 990o:259) Introduction This article forms part of a wider study of the performer in African contexts in which I am less concerned with the intention, beliefs, and putative efficacy of any given performance-a focus that receives continual attention from many scholars-than with the techniques, methods, and occasions of behavior that distinguish the two types of performing: not-acting and acting. Some studies of African theatre and performance (see Drewal 1992) have made use of the performance theories of Richard Schechner, Herbert Blau, and others. The collection of essays edited by Phillip Zarrilli, Acting (Re)Considered, has brought together theories of acting which have been developed over several decades. Among the most useful of these for the purposes of this article has been Michael Kirby's methodical exposition of the subtle differences in per- forming between not-acting and acting ([1972] 1995). This article attempts to apply to performers in Africa the first section of Kirby's not-acting to acting continuum-the first three stages, which deal with non-acting-and to note how it shades into "acting" with a change of context, even when not initiated by the performers. First are those roles that require minimal skills and are performed by persons whom I shall refer to as "stage- hands," recognizing that while in Western theatre this designation refers to off- stage and largely unseen activity that may not require special skills, this is not always so in an African context. The stagehand is, however, always in a support- ing role and cannot sustain a performance independent of a leading character. While they occupy a conspicuous status for the duration of a performance, stagehands are not themselves perceived primarily as performers but simply as The Drama Review 43, 2 (T162), Summer 1999.

Although they predominantly fulfill a functional role within a performance and thus are "non-matrixed"-to use Kirby's term- in respect to the reasons why they are in a staged relationship to a performer, they are, as we shall see, "matrixed." To this extent, they may be described as per- formers with a bit part or a walk-on part, as this keeps open the possibility of some deliberate intention on their part to present themselves as performers, albeit in a limited way. Even when the "stagehand-performer" deliberately presents her- or himself' as a performer, the primary objective and responsibility of the stagehand is to enable the leading actor to perform appropriately, and without worry or concern about the mechanics of costume, location, or timing. In seeking to ascribe features of reality and pretence as proposed by Kirby to the presentations of performers in Africa, there are, however, two further di- mensions that need to be taken into account: The first is the audience-performer relationship in which the interaction between them is a suspension of the ordi- nary rather than a suspension of reality and thus constitutes more of a heightening of reality in which it is recognized that ordinary people can become extra-ordi- nary for a period of time. The second feature follows from this and constitutes a preference for multilayered performances whereby any one performer may, within a single performance, be at one point "acting" and at another "presenting the self." Neither the audience nor the performer experiences any difficulty in accommodating a movement between the two. A sustained, uninterrupted rep- resentation is not required in order to convince the spectators of the presence of an "other." It is more a case of recognizing that some people have-albeit tem- porarily (i.e., for the duration of the performance)-the power to move be- tween the presentation of self and the presentation of an "other." In the case of those whom-in order to emphasize their functional role-I have called stagehands, the notion of an "aside-in-reverse" might help the reader to comprehend the quality of change inherent in playing this role. By this I mean that the percentage of time, within a single performance, that the stage- hand-performer is interacting directly with the audience as himself (as in a con- ventional Western aside) is considerably greater than the time he is playing a role. In these roles, while the stagehand does not "pretend" to be someone else, he is, nevertheless, in several performance forms (the Ibibio puppet theatre, the Sapo masks, the Chamba mask), engaged in activities that are "make-believe" and therefore can be said to shade slightly into acting. This exemplifies the cru- cial point within such performances: the players do not necessarily maintain a single mode of performing throughout a performance, but may move quite fre- quently between "pretence" and reality. While this might seem Brechtian in its effect, in fact it does not serve to remind the spectator that what they are seeing is just a fiction and the character is in reality just an ordinary person, but rather to demonstrate that an ordinary person can become extra-ordinary. In the second modality I place those performances which have no aspiration to "pretence," focus on presenting an intensification of self, require a high de- gree of performing skill, and may be either support or lead roles. The absence of any aspiration to acting and the presence of highly devel- oped skills distinguish this modality from the first, albeit in the case of support roles, they are still part of elaborating the central act or character. These support performers, recognized as skillful and entertaining in their own right, often use the opportunity to present themselves in such a way as to gain recognition and applause for their skills. However, like the stagehand-performer, they pri- marily support the central characters and do not upstage central performers. While they may even perform separately-spatially or sequentially-from them, their presence remains dependent on that of the lead performer. This is what distinguishes them from the lead performers. Crucially, they are not act- ing-i.e., they do not attempt to imply that they are anyone other than them-</page><page sequence="3">I20 Frances Harding selves nor that they are in any "time or place different from the spectator" (Kirby [1972] I995:43). Lead performers in this modality are those whose acts, displays of skill, or presentations of self are the primary focus of the entertain- ment. Among them are acrobats, dancers, animal tamers, storytellers, musi- cians, snake charmers, strongmen, and praise singers whose performance draws an audience irrespective of any other performers. Kirby sets out a basic definition of acting: "To act means to feign, to simu- late, to represent, to impersonate" ([I972] I995:43). He makes a primary dis- tinction between acting that is "active" on the part of the performer, and the manner in which "other qualities that define acting may also be applied to the performer" by onlookers (44). This posits an elementary bifurcation between the active intention of the perpetrator-performer and the active perception of the recipient-spectator. It recognizes a distinction between performers who are deliberately seeking to present the self as "other" and those whose activities are not intended to have any of the connotations of Kirby's definition of acting but who may nevertheless be perceived as acting. This is what Kirby calls "re- ceived acting" and precedes two further, more intense, and-crucially-inten- tional degrees of acting which he names as "simple" acting and "complex" acting. These latter categories of performing emphasize the deliberate presenta- tion of an "other" rather than the "self"-in essence, acting. I shall consider these stages in detail elsewhere and will here just briefly refer to simple acting. I will conclude this article with an analysis of the presentation of self as other among the Nuba men of Sudan. My example, Nuba personal art, falls at the third point on Kirby's continuum, received acting. In its original context, Nuba personal art formed part of a cluster of seasonal activities but, under con- temporary external pressures, has become a double-layered presentation of self in which the performers re-present themselves. The practice of self-decoration which identifies a young man as healthy and physically strong among the Nuba people (see Faris 1972:19) initially placed them as symbolically matrixed within the society, but was perceived by outsiders in such a way as to consti- tute received acting, and then, in response, reconstituted and reinforced by the Nuba men themselves to become a form of simple acting. So that the reader can situate this article into a fuller context, I begin by briefly outlining Kirby's framework and then consider how it can be usefully applied to the experience of African performers. Kirby's Continuum Kirby has named five stages of the transition from not-acting into acting to describe the range of human behavior that constitutes the presentation of the self "in a special way": "[W]e can follow a continuous increase in the degree of representation from nonmatrixed performing through symbolized matrix, received acting and simple acting to complex acting" ([1972] I995:5I). These concepts of performing as representation concentrate on the individual experience for both the perpetrator and the recipient, i.e., performer and spec- tator. Applying Kirby's framework and methodology to performance in Africa enables an analysis of the attitudes and expectations of the performer in relation to performance to be developed without reference to the degree of belief in- volved. In the essentially phenomenological experience of performing, belief is not a measure of quality of performance, even if it is of socio-spiritual efficacy: Belief may exist in either the spectator or the performer, but it does not affect objective classification according to our acting/not-acting scale. Whether an actor feels what he or she is doing to be "real" or a spectator</page><page sequence="4">African Performance I2I really "believes" what is seen, does not change the classification of the performance [...]. (5I) By addressing the phenomenon of performing within a continuum of "not- acting" to "acting," Kirby's framework avoids the sociological overlap be- tween "sacred" and "secular," "old" and "new," "ritual" and "drama," and focuses instead on the craft of performing in its several modes. Reconciling Desire and Ability Not everyone who would like to display the self as skilled has equal compe- tence, imagination, or talent, and this necessitates some people occupying "lead" roles while others take up "supporting" roles. Recognition of the rela- tive nature of skill and talent is evident in the widespread use of structured competition in many societies throughout Africa (Horton I960; Ottenberg I975). Even within kin-based organizations with responsibility for funerary or other ceremonial rites such as hunters' dances, blacksmiths' dances, or mas- querades, there is room for flexibility regarding the extent and nature of indi- vidual involvement in performance. How then is the desire to display the self and ambition to perform reconciled with ability within a performance? Happily, in the production of a perfor- mance, there are many tasks, functions, and roles to be fulfilled, all necessary but not all requiring equal skills or sharing equal responsibility. Those with the talent and the interest may opt to take up a leading role, while those with interest and less ability can opt to take up a supporting role. Peer and commu- nity pressure enable the ranking to take place informally at a private, social level and publicly at a competitive level. I have seen a disabled young man dance his rightful share of a funerary dance and still be openly laughed at for daring to get up and dance in public. 1.

These persons are seen onstage, but may not be con- sidered to be either acting or performing. They may not even consider them- selves to be "performing," but rather just carrying out a task. They are clearly outside the "informational structure of the narrative" (Kirby [1972] I995:44) according to the visual evidence of costuming or masking, yet their presence cannot be ignored and is essential to the performance. This constitutes Kirby's first category of "perceived" performer, which he calls "nonmatrixed" (44). These are those stage persons who: "Even if the spectator ignores them as people [...] they are not invisible. They do not act, and yet they are part of the visual presentation" (44). In some instances, they are "supporters"; in others, their task is as "minders" or "attendants," protecting both the performer and the audience (Bravmann I977:52). Often, the central performer-for example, the masked figure, the stilt walker, or the concealed puppeteer-may have his vision limited by the costume. In such instances, there are guides who lead or conduct performers safely around or out of a performing area. Alternatively, performers may be in an altered state of mind or a trance, and need to be "brought back" or fenced around so that they do not harm themselves. For example, in the bori possession cult of the Hausa people of northern Nigeria, several women are designated as assistants (Onwuejeogwu 1969:283). Every performance requires technical assistance and technical assistants whose task is to make possible the performer's task of entertaining. Such people are "stagehands," a description reflecting their supportive, nonengaged role. They are there to prepare for the performance and to ensure that it runs smoothly. They remove obstacles so that nothing will distract the audience's attention from the performer. They have tasks to fulfill throughout the perfor- mance, before, during, and after: The preparations for Isinyago begin some days before the actual day of performance. The animals are made in the bush preferably in an area where there is plenty of bamboo and grass. When the makers are satisfied with their work, they prepare a square near the village or homestead where the performance will take place. This square is joined to the actual village square by a clean, stump-free "road." [sic] This is important. Dancing during a dark night and dressed in their masks, the dancers cannot see their way. Their path must be clear to avoid calamities. (Wembah-Rashid 1971:4o) Such activities represent the extreme end of the functional aspect of being a stagehand. They also represent the least visible aspect of the stagehand's work. But not all stagehands carry out their work invisible to the audience. Nor do they always play such clearly backstage and offstage roles, but rather usually make a more creative contribution onstage in a number of ways. Describing, for example, a 1914 Ibibio puppet theatre constructed from blankets stretched loosely across posts, Percy Amaury Talbot noted the role of such attendants in setting the scene and creating "atmosphere": In front stood three men, armed with brushes of palm fibre, with which they continually beat the screen of blankets causing them to quiver, and thus hide any movement made by the real performers as they passed up and down behind. The practical purpose of this little piece of byplay was disguised from the credulous onlookers [...] by the pretext that it was</page><page sequence="6">African Performance 123 part of the powerful Broom Juju and necessary for the manifestation of the spirits of the play. (1923:76-77) What Amaury Talbot refers to as "byplay," is in fact a key task. The sup- port performers are essential to the reinforcement of the implicit narrative of the performance, regardless of how purely functional their role may appear. Their role is a bridge between the nonhuman world of the puppets and the human world of the spectators. If the movements of the puppeteers inside and underneath the stage were not screened, spectators would have to publicly ac- knowledge the presence of human beings as the active agency mobilizing the puppets. In the Ibibio puppet theatre, because their actions are contextualized as having meaning, the "blanket-beaters" become part of the informational structure of the performance and are therefore matrixed. Nevertheless, however essential they are to the performance, it is never the "custodian" (Fardon 1990:156), "guide," or "attendant" (Bravmann 1977:52) that the audience comes to see, for the role of the stagehand is to reinforce the role of the central character. Although Kirby has pointed out that the Japanese kabuki attendants are not within the "informational structure of the narrative" (45), when we turn to the stagehand in African performance, we find that he is-sometimes implicitly and often ambiguously, as with the Ibibio-incorporated in the structure of the narrative. One key lies in the perception of the performance. Within kabuki performance, there is public recognition that a fiction is being enacted, whereas within masked or puppet performance in the African context, the spectator may be interacting with the puppet performer or the masked figure as bringing a particular kind of reality briefly into being. The spectators' part in the enacted world of the performers is-publicly at least-to acknowledge the puppets or masked figures as spirits, deities, or ancestors. The hidden manipulators in puppet performances require external assis- tance, as do many masquerade performers. In these performances, the support performer often interacts with lead masked performers so that they can fulfill their more specialized roles, as for example when the sightlines of the masked figure are partially restricted by costuming. In order to ensure that the masked 2. The or-usu (fire-man) lights the stage for the masked performer in a kwagh-hir puppet theatre performance in central Ni- geria, 1995. (Photo by Frances Harding)</page><page sequence="7">124 Frances Harding figure is able to move around safely, that its costume remains secure, and that it does not exceed the behavior appropriate to its characterization, it may need to be guided by another person, a stagehand. Furthermore, as a masquer- ade performance can last throughout the day, this stagehand/guide must also fan the masked figure to keep it cool, lead it to a place where it can rest and drink, and generally protect it during and between acts. In performance, the stagehand may tie a rope around the middle of the masked figure and then hold onto the end so that both the masked figure and the spectators are pro- tected from each other's excesses. The stagehand-however essential to the success of the performance-is usually uncostumed and relates directly to the masked figure, making no attempt to draw the attention of the audience to himself and often, in fact, ignoring the crowd: The masked figure is accompanied by a custodian who leads it into the performing area while striking a small double hand gong. Occasionally he may speak to the creature to coax it into dancing or to warn it against unruly conduct. [...] Its dance finished, the mask is led out of the crowd by its custodian [...]. (Fardon 1990:156-57) While fulfilling the task of guiding the masked figure, the stagehand is seen as an ordinary, everyday person, in contrast to the fantastical masked figure. In this way, the self-effacing performance contributes to the mystique of the masquerade character, which purports to behave unpredictably. In order to be perceived as possessing the unpredictable quality associated with supernatural status, the masked figure must be seen to need to be controlled: Within the context of Lo Gue [...] it is incumbent on the directors of this masking organisation to control these potentially dangerous elements of its personality [...T]o this end a host of talismans will be tucked into the bamba-da, the tall peaked white caps worn by the lead griots who play and dance for Gyinna-Gyinna and tied to the waist of the attendants of these masked figures. Only the Gyinna-Gyinna require human guides, two strong young men who hold onto a sturdy rope tied to the waist of the djinn. No other Lo Gue mask requires such attention for no other has the independence of mind or the inherent power to lash out at the living who come to observe this honorific performance. (Bravmann 1977:52) Thus, in spite of the deliberate absence of visual signals (costuming, behav- ior, etc.) the stagehand is drawn into the "informational structure" of the per- formance. Why then is it useful to call him a "stagehand," suggesting a technical, unseen role, if he is in fact obliquely part of the narrative or charac- terization? Firstly and crucially, the possibility of unruly behavior is real; the masked figure in certain circumstances is at liberty to behave in an irrational manner and to cause, perhaps, actual physical harm to people (Drewal 1992:98). Secondly, the masked figure's vision is restricted. Thus, I suggest that the primary function of the stagehand is practical and the aesthetic or spiritual interpretations follow the need for such a figure onstage with the masked fig- ure. However, the aggressive characteristics of the masked figure, the central performer, may be extended to its attendants with "real," immediate effects on the audiences, as among the Chamba: "A braided rope, the tail of the creature, may be worn down the back of the masked figure or else carried by an atten- dant who uses it as a whip to strike at bystanders" (Fardon 1990:151; plate I). While the functional and spiritual combine on occasion in the role of the stagehand, there is also a further layer of meaningful personal activity involved.</page><page sequence="8">African Performance I25 In those instances where the stagehand's task as guide, protector, or attendant has been accommodated within the informational structure, the young men who are the supporters of these masks are themselves demonstrating personal attributes, such as strength or skill. They are simultaneously being real protectors and display- ing the self in an advantageous manner. In neither instance are they acting in the sense of adopting a character other than their own-but they are performing: Sapo daytime masks, which are controlled by associations of young warrior- age men, are said to be "pulled"-that is taken from the forest and brought to town for festive occasions during the dry season. The ability to control these anthropomorphic bush creatures demonstrates the physical powers and prowess of the young men involved. (Lifschitz 1988:223; italics added) A link to speech is another option for these non-acting performers: The "bush" spirits orate, recite poetry and sing, all in self-disguised voices. They may have a "speaker" or assistant accompanying them who repeats their words in normal speech [...]. (Lifschitz 1988:223) Describing the performances of four masked figures among the Gade people of northern Nigeria, Shuaibu Na'ibi notes that: None of these four [...] speak in such a way that people can understand what they are saying, but they put something in their mouths which makes them sound like a bird whistling. Whenever they appear, their followers accompany them, showing them the way and translating what they are saying-for they do not like the people to know that it is only a man inside the [...] costume. (Na'ibi 1958:297) The Second Modality: Support Performers and Lead Performers So far I have considered those persons whose onstage roles have largely been restricted to being there and being either self-effacing or supportive; to re- straining violence in the masked figure or even displaying potential violence themselves. There is however a second category of support performer. While these roles require more highly developed skills, the primary focus of the per- formance remains with the lead characters. These performers then move from the first point on Kirby's continuum-nonmatrixed-to the second point where they occupy a state of "symbolized matrix": their costume, role, or presence is recognized as being within the orbit of deliberately presenting the self in a special way, though still not as other than the self. Support Performers This second modality requires performers to have real skills that present the self advantageously. Recognized as skillful and entertaining in their own right, they use the opportunity to present themselves so as to gain recognition and applause for their skills. Still, like the stagehand-performer, they are primarily there as support for the central characters. They do not upstage central per- formers and may perform separately and sequentially from the lead characters. Their function remains dependent on the presence of the lead performer and it is this that distinguishes them from the lead performers. The Tiv people of central Nigeria have an elaborate puppet theatre called kwagh-hir, meaning "something wonderful." These are usually all-night perfor-</page><page sequence="9">I126 Frances Harding 3. In a kwagh-hirpe~for- mance the or-usu persuades the royal mask to dance (1977). (Photo by Richard Fardon) mances that take place during the dry season. They are mixed-media events with puppetry, masquerades, singers, dancers, and others, including the shuwa (narrator) and the or-usu (fire-man) whose flaming torch lights up the acting arena and leads the concealed puppeteers in their mobile stages around the pe- rimeter so that each section of the audience can see. The puppet stage or dagbera is about the size of an average dining table and has enclosed sides con- cealing the puppeteers underneath (plates 2 and 3). The puppets perform on the top surface but the enclosed sides of the dagbera restrict vision so much that dif- ferent sounds as well as light are used to guide the puppeteers as they maneuver the mobile stage around to two or three stopping points in the performance arena. The limited sightlines from the dagbera mean that the or-usu must call out to the concealed puppeteers to let them know where to go and brandish his torch in front of the small holes in the front of the dagbera. The shuwa per-</page><page sequence="10">African Performance I27 forms between acts, announcing the next one and then standing on the sidelines during the performance. These or-usu are not self-effacing characters like the masquerade guides we considered earlier. On the con- trary, they make much of the opportunity to display their virtuosity. It is the or-usu, or fire-man, who, with his flaming torches, provides a leading light to the hid- den puppeteers. Like the masquerade guides, he is tech- nically essential for the expedient fulfillment of the performance (plate 4); unlike them, he is expected to inject his performance with personal skills that entertain the audience and contribute substantially to the success of the production. In these puppet performances, there is also a group of singers and sometimes dancers-often older women- who provide a sung accompaniment to the puppet show as well as songs during interludes between each act. Most important, however, is the shuwa, or narrator, who pre- cedes each act with a pr~cis of it. Like the dancers or singers and the or-usu at a kwagh-hir show, the shuwa- who can be either a man or a woman-deliberately pre- sents the self as a skilled performer. Thus in a puppet performance the dancers, singers, the shuwa, and the or- usu are presenting the self as skilled performers, but re- main support performers to the puppets and masquerades. In addition to skilled support performers, there are of course a whole host of skilled, non-acting lead performers. Lead performers are those whose acts and displays of skill are the primary focus of the entertainment. Among them are acrobats, dancers, animal tamers, storytellers, musicians, snake charmers, strongmen, praise singers, puppeteers, and masqueraders. Within Kirby's con- tinuum, these performers have not yet moved from "presenting the self" to presenting an "other." Nevertheless, it is difficult for the performers to main- tain a "non-acting" position as they demonstrate their skills. The Lead Performer The non-acting lead performer presents the self in a specific skilled role such as dancer, singer, tightrope walker, wrestler, storyteller, ventriloquist, or musi- cian. Their intention is to draw attention to their skills, to themselves, and to entertain the audience. For example, a performer can develop a lead role in a ventriloquist's act: In an open space [...] two long stout stakes are driven into the earth, forked or notched at the ends. Between them, from top to top, a long palm-stem is laid, and upon this a row of small fetishes [sic] are carefully balanced, one by one. Then tom-toms [sic] are beaten, at first slowly and softly but with ever increasing rhythm. When the music grows loud and fast, the little idols [sic] begin to dance and talk with the voice of a man. Eggs can also be made to talk in a similar manner. (Amaury Talbot 1923:75-76) Alternatively, the performer may demonstrate skills in relation to specific ani- mals, as for example at an agricultural show in Sokoto province, Nigeria, held in the I950s, where the "hyena-tamers and snake charmers and magicians all come to perform" (Nigeria Magazine 1958:339). Similarly, in Oshogbo, Nigeria, at the 4. The front of the dagbera (puppet stage) used in kwagh-hir puppet theatre, central Nigeria, 1993. (Photo by Frances Harding)</page><page sequence="11">I128 Frances Harding festival for Shango, many different forms of entertainment are described, includ- ing "tub-thumping"--of a literal sort: Pestles and mortar normally used for grinding cassava are properties in this act. Confederates pound heartily whilst Strong Man holds a mortar on his chest. [...] The strong man is also the tumbler and contortionist as well. [...] (D.W.M. 1953:302-o3) The magician toys directly with illusion-employing sleight of hand to give an impression of shifting things in an impossible sequence. Again, it is the cre- ation of an illusion that is dependent on actual skill and Bernard Beckerman notes that: He (the magician) creates so convincing an illusion of actuality that our eyes accept what our minds hold in abeyance. It is this conflict between eyes and minds that produces the sense of wonder in us. (1990:33) It is only when a performer replaces him- or herself with an illusion that "acting" is said to take place. Richard Schechner has observed that performers are "not-themselves" and "not not themselves" (1985:6) and Marvin Carlson restates this, asserting that, within the play frame, a performer "is not herself (because of the operations of illusion), but she is also not not herself (because of the operations of reality). Performer and audience alike operate in a world of double consciousness" (1996:54). Illusion however is not ostensibly a feature of the performance of the acro- bat, whose physical suppleness challenges the restraints of human physiog- nomy and produces awe and wonder in the spectator: At Henshaw town, Calabar, a celebrated play is sometimes given at the time of the full moon. A single slender pole is fixed in the ground. Up this a man climbs till he reaches the top, when he stands on the point and dances i.e., sways to and fro, rippling the muscles of back and waist, and waving his arms. [...] After a while he climbs down head foremost, or springs from the top, turning two somersaults before reaching the ground. (Amaury Talbot 1923:75) Similarly, in the streets of Nairobi there are young boy performers who can bend over backwards, stand on their hands, and by bringing their feet through the space between their arms and the ground, hold a matchbox in the toes of one foot and a match in those of the other and light it. They have other tricks such as being able to bend over backward and "walk" their feet more than half- way around their body. Another example is found among the Tiv people of Nigeria where acrobats can fold up their body into the most extreme contorted positions so that they themselves fit onto a shallow disc the size of a chair seat. Everywhere men-and women, but less so-juggle and bend and spring and in so doing create the illusion of doing the impossible. But it is an illusion because it is possible: they do it. To this extent, the acrobat is also drawing attention only to him- or herself-but doing it not only through the display of skill like the singer or musician, but, like the storyteller, through the creation of an illu- sion. It is, however, a double illusion that is created by the acrobat. Whereas for the storyteller the element of fiction is primary in the content of the display, for the acrobat, the element of fiction is absent, for such performers are the "subject of the performance" (Harrop 1992:5).</page><page sequence="12">African Performance 129 5. A puppet performs on the slotted top of a dagbera (puppet stage), 1993. (Photo by Frances Harding) In the all-day salla parade that follows the ending of Ramaddan in Katsina, northern Nigeria, among the hundreds of performers are scores of young men, yan tauri (tough guys), who draw sharp knives and swords across their bare stomachs without cutting themselves. At the same time, a high-pitched squeaking is emitted apparently from a tiny gourd that each performer carries slung on his wrist; he holds it up for the audience to see that he is not squeez- ing or rubbing it to produce the noise. The claim is that the noise happens automatically when the knife touches the bare flesh. Whatever the truth of the technique, the illusion that there is a direct relationship between flesh, noise, and knife makes impressive entertainment. It is quite different from the snake charmer in the same parade, who lifts the snake and places its head into his mouth. In this case, there is no illusion-the snake really is in his mouth- but the entertainment is no less impressive. There is another category of performer whose skill is based not on illusion but on a kind of reality that elevates the mind of the listener, and is applauded for that. This particular category is very fully developed in the role of the omioko in Idoma inquest inquiries. The Idoma people live in central Nigeria. In Idoma society, after a death, an inquiry is held to find out who is respon- sible for the death. This is not undertaken in order to ascribe blame but to find out the social reason for the death. The omioko were young men with good, vibrant, resonate and powerful voices. They had learned their art through observation and participation and other modes of training. The omioko knew the society and its tradi- tions very well. They were the agents through which the participants spoke both to each other and to the spectators. (Amali 1985:23) The verbal play of the omioko is an example of a key, skilled support role. The omioko is able to move around the inquest arena, not aligning himself spatially or ideologically with any faction, but "moving from one participant to the next in the order in which they spoke" (Amali 1985:23). In his role, the</page><page sequence="13">I 30 Frances Harding omioko controls order and focuses the attention of the speakers and the spec- tators on the performance of the inquest. The omioko is clearly at the critical midpoint of change on the continuum ranging from support to lead characters. He is an essential character but sup- posedly only as a transmitter, not creator, of information. He does not move the narrative forward; he does not, theoretically, contribute to the substance of the proceedings. His role is to amplify, elaborate, modify the substantive statements from leading participants in the inquest. Yet there could be no in- quest without the omioko, for as Amali notes: "The omioko's functions added formality and dignity to the occasion" (1985:23). By his skill and knowledge of the participants and their circumstances and the history of the families involved, he not only orchestrates the proceedings, but may subtly di- rect them as well. Another performer who falls into this category, but somewhat differently, is the storyteller, who introduces another element into the experience. Storytell- ers are recognized and appreciated because of their special skills in the art of narrating. The telling of the narrative is the personal skill to which the storytell- ers want to draw the attention of the audience; it takes place in the present tense of the performance. There is however also the content of the perfor- mance, which may take place in the past or future or in imagined time. Thus as with song, music, and (to some extent) dance, the content can be appreci- ated separately from the performer and the performance. In storytelling, there is an emphasis on the non-real elements because this requires in the minds of the listeners the creation of images and characters who do not exist in a phe- nomenological form for the audience. The storyteller, as John Harrop puts it, is "speaking in his own person" (1992:5). Yet if-or as-he moves in and out of characterization as the plot progresses, from time to time he can be said to be "acting" in the sense of impersonating an other. Beckerman draws a dis- tinction between what he calls those acts of skill that exist to display skills and those that exist to display skills in order to "achieve an emotional response." Whereas the first category exists for itself and provokes a response of awe and wonder, the latter, or "what I call the illusory or fictive show includes the dis- play of skill but shadows a second realm in the exercise of the perceptible skill. It is such a double-imaged act that is the basis of drama" (199o:I6). This can be clearly seen in Lele Gbomba's performances: [...] Gbomba's theater diminished everything but the domeigbuamoi. In the course of his prologue, he stripped himself of his gown, his shoes, his shirt-everything but a pair of blue shorts and a lappa of cloth, and a headtie, which were his only props. Thus, stripped down to his wiry ag- ile frame, a plastic face with enormous eyes, and an incredible modulated voice, Lele Gbomba became his pantheon: a whorish mincing senior wife, brushing off patting hands with outraged stares and limp-wristed swats; a pompous mallam dispensing tedious sententiae to his followers; an English colonial officer stiffly complaining in military cadence: "Oh my God, oh very much, what? Oh light, oh light oh God, my Father!" (Cosentino 1980:55) Many storytellers assist their audiences to imagine the characters about whom they speak by characterizing them in voice and body movement. Thus, while the storyteller is real, those about whom the audience hears may not be real. This involves illusion-the creation of perceptions, sensations, expecta- tions, and resolutions about characters who do not actually exist and about events which are not actually taking place. Yet the experiences of the audi- ence are real enough-fear, laughter, sadness. The best of the storytellers then,</page><page sequence="14">African Peiformance 13 I like the dancer and the musician and the singer, presents her/himself as the central figure of the performance, and bring into illusory being a whole range of characters who fulfill the narrative. Not all, however, are equally skilled, for example: nearly everyone in Mendeland-women and men, chiefs and children- could and did perform these domeisia [...]. Only a few Mende became creative performers of domeisia, and fewer still earn the name of domeigbuamoi, or "pullers" of the domei. (Cosentino 1980:54) Not all storytelling, of course, requires the same degree of dramatization and Spencer (1990) makes a distinction between the Mende ngawovei historic narratives in which there is no embellishment or dramatization and the domei. Each requires a different performing style and has different aims. The former is delivered in a straight manner, the latter with as much elaboration as the storyteller chooses. The Third Modality: "Act Yourself" Up until now, I have been considering modalities of performing in which the element of pretence, impersonation, and feigning is minimal or intermit- tent. Nevertheless, each modality can be discerned from ordinary, everyday activities: the activity is clearly specialized, differentiated, and entertaining. Regardless of either the increasing level of skill required or of their status as support or lead roles, all fall within Kirby's first stage of the continuum: nonmatrixed performing. The performers are people being themselves, present- ing the self in a special way. Kirby then defines the next point: As we move toward acting from this extreme non-acting position on the continuum, we come to that condition in which the performer does not act and yet his or her costume represents something or someone. We could call this a "symbolized matrix." ([1972] 1995:44) This "symbolized matrix" is often encountered when local people in local dress are seen by visitors for the first time and who may describe the locals as be- ing "in costume" whereas actually the local people are just "dressed." An ex- treme example of this--and one which gained some international notoreity-was apparent in the presentation of the self practiced by the Nuba people of the southern Sudan whose display of the socialized self was taken to one form of aes- thetic perfection. Nuba people have developed an aesthetic display of the self in order to cel- ebrate the young healthy body, which is the prerequisite for personal survival and for the survival of the group in the arid conditions of the southeast Nuba mountains (Faris 1978). It is a form of self-presentation that is limited to the nonfarming dry season and to the home villages. Thus it can be said that there is a clear theatre of activity and a clear duration of performance within the home culture. The focus of the performance is on the physicality of the young people, essential to the survival of the society. There are different visual art conventions for men and women. Girls are permitted from an early age to apply a mixture of oil and either yellow or red ochre clay over themselves. The choice of color is regulated by the clan affili- ation of the girl. Access to the use of this color is a permanent option in a girl's life, although she is unlikely to use it after her own family is well estab-</page><page sequence="15">132 Frances Harding lished. As well as coloring, girls are also subject to a series of one-off bouts of body decoration, which is carried out in three phases. As she develops physi- cally, the girl receives her first set of cicatrizations below her breasts; at the onset of menses, she receives a second set around her navel and across her stomach. Finally after the birth of her first child and as the child is weaned, she receives the third and final set over her entire back and shoulders. Unlike her socially determined coloring, this decoration is linked directly to the girl's biological development into a physically mature woman. Whereas the cicatri- zation is linked to the performance of social roles, biologically determined, the application of coloring and oil over the permanent decoration is often done in preparation for the dances that take place in conjunction with, and following, the displays of fighting by the young men. So to summarize the procedures for the women: first, they have permanent ac- cess from an early age to temporary coloring and then a one-off access to a se- quence of permanent markings. These two forms of personal display come together at high points of entertainment in a display designed to draw the atten- tion of the young men to the young women and vice versa. For both the young women and the young men, these dances are opportunities to enjoy themselves. In contrast, the young men do not receive permanent markings but do, through a system of age grades, gradually acquire the permanent right to apply to their bodies temporary clay markings or patterns of specific colors. This is done very frequently throughout the dry season-sometimes more than twice in a day. The color range permitted to the young men keeps pace with their age so access to the full range increases steadily. The applied design itself may be very temporary and sometimes is kept on the body for only a few hours before the young man decides to try out another design. Although the right to use the full range of colors, once acquired, is forever, in practice few men apply the coloring after their most physically perfect years have passed. A spe- cific range of hairstyles for men is similarly linked to age and status and is a longer-lasting, though not permanent, form of decoration and identification. The body and face designs are a personal choice and have no personal ritual significance, but the hairstyles-although they too are personal choice-do have social significance. In performance, natural physical attributes enhanced by artifice, validated by social status and presented in a display of skill, create an aesthetic combining color and kinesis in balanced asymmetry. These activities of self-decoration constitute what Kirby has called a "sym- bolized matrix" and, at the point when the decoration and its purpose reach their apogee in the dances, they come into the category of presenting the self "in a special way" (Mude 1983:2). The Nuba people experienced in a particularly traumatic way the effects of outside interference. In the 1970s, Leni Riefenstahl, a German photographer fa- mous for her film of the 1936 Olympic Games, recorded on film the personal body art of the young Nuba people. Her photographs were published in two very graphic books, The Last of the Nuba and The People of Kau, which became very popular outside the Sudan and brought about substantial social changes to the Nuba people. Among these was a steady influx of mainly German tourists who came to see the young men self-decorate and paid them to do it. The Nuba people's awareness of their potential to use their ordinary practice as an entertainment grew and was recorded on the BBC film South-Eastern Nuba (1982) as they decorated for tourists and for the camera crew. At one point, on being criticized by his peers for applying a particular color and pattern in the wrong order, a young Nuba man answers, "Oh it will do for the Germans," re- ferring to the BBC television crew as "Germans"-the audience to which they had become most accustomed. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the altered practice of self-decoration and of his own altered role as a painted youth.</page><page sequence="16">African Performance 133 Nuba public self-decoration practices have reduced in subtlety of expression as the role of the outsider has had an increasing impact on the society. Nuba people had to accommodate their own perception and practice of body deco- ration and the accompanying fights and dances to a new group of people, de- fined only as spectators. These spectators did not have the insider knowledge to see the young people as symbolically matrixed with reference primarily to the rest of Nuba society. This has shifted some Nuba self-decoration practices to a different level of meaning. The body painting is now often carried out as entertainment for outsiders, its meaning for the insiders submerged. The pro- cess (self-decorating) and the product (decorated men) have become a perfor- mance. Thus the means (body painting) to the end (display of self to peers, ensuring the survival of the group) is seemingly no longer the objective of the practice. Practitioners are no longer carrying out the decoration with a view to identifying themselves within the Nuba group as young, strong, and healthy (Faris I972) and simultaneously as an aesthetic work, but as people who paint their bodies-albeit with a careless reference to aesthetics. They have moved from doing things with a combined aesthetic, social, and physical focus as part of their experience of growing up and growing older in Nuba society to doing these things in order to fulfill an externally defined role. The original meaning is ignored. It is not lost or changed, nor (possibly) has it be- come obsolete; it is just deliberately being ignored. People have selected from their daily practices elements that, once isolated, take on new meanings. The Nuba practices are those in which people are carrying out actions for- merly embedded in a social matrix but in which, to the stranger's eye, the performative elements dominate and can be isolated, extrapolated, and re-pre- sented. Implicit in this perception is the notion of strangeness, of dissimilarity to the cultural practices of the observer, and congruence with the observer's expec- tation of the observed-all converging through the power of the stranger's eye and purse to redefine and recontextualize. Thus, while in the original context the activity may fall under the category of "symbolized matrix," as the per- former comes to do it more and more for reasons other than "being" or "be- coming," it is transformed into a presentational activity. In deliberately seeking to fulfill a predetermined role and a temporarily redefined identity, the actions come closer to "acting." As Kirby describes it: In a symbolized matrix the referential elements are applied to but not acted by the performer [...] As "received" references increase, however, it is difficult to say that the performer is not acting even though he or she is doing nothing that could be defined as acting. [...] When the matrices are strong, persistent and reinforce each other, we see an actor, no matter how ordinary the behavior. This condition, the next step closer to true acting on our continuum, we may refer to as "received acting." (45) When the nonmatrixed performers are situated in such a way that observers perceive them as "performing," then, in spite of how they may perceive them- selves, the performers move closer to what Kirby has called "received acting." Initially framed by Reifenstahl's camera, the men's body decoration practices constituted "received acting." However, taking control of the opportunity, the Nuba men, in their redefined practice of self-decoration, went further. As soon as they opted to self-decorate for outsiders, they moved from perceived acting-what Kirby calls "received acting"-to what he calls "simple acting" in which an element of pretence is deliberately employed. For the cameras and for the outsiders, the Nuba men were "acting" as the Nuba men defined by Reifenstahl's pictures; they could also simultaneously inter- act with each other in asides (even when still within the acting arena) as the</page><page sequence="17">134 Frances Harding Nuba men they "really" were-intending to eat and drink, to enjoy themselves, to shop at the market with the money they were earning by "acting" as them- selves for the outsiders. Acting became the work-task (Goffman I959:72), with the acts themselves, based on the older practices, adjusted to meet the new demands: Instead of merely doing his task and giving vent to his feelings, he will ex- press the doing of his task and acceptably convey his feelings. In general then, the representation of an activity will vary in some degree from the ac- tivity itself and therefore inevitably misrepresent it. And since the individual will be required to rely on signs in order to construct a representation of his activity, the image he constructs, however faithful to the facts, will be sub- ject to all the disruptions that impressions are subject to. (Goffman 1959:72) Although the "worktasks" (Goffman 1959:72) have changed, they are worktasks nonetheless. A move from farmer-hunter to actor has been made. Note I. I have used the male pronoun throughout as almost all performers are male except singers and dancers and a few instrumentalists. The women's Sande Society in Sierra Leone is an exception to the practice of male masking. References Amali, S.O.O. 1985 An Ancient Nigerian Drama. Stuttgart: Fraanz Steiner Verlag Wiesbaden.
