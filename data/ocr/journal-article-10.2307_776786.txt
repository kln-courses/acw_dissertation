<plain_text><page sequence="1">James Ensor and Symbolist Literature By Diane Lesko T he art of James Ensor (1860-1949) is generally described as expres- sionistic, particularly when such well- known paintings as the 1887 Tribula- tions of St. Anthony (New York, Museum of Modern Art) and the 1888 Entry of Christ into Brussels (see Fig. 7) are considered.' Yet Ensor also made a major contribution to the Symbolist movement. In a number of works inspired by his personal life, he investi- gated the implications of a reality that existed beneath the surface of banal experience. That he began these explo- rations in the early 1880s places him in the forefront of a developing Symbolist aesthetic. Although Ensor was familiar with the intellectual life of contemporary Europe and assimilated it into his artistic com- mentary, he restricted himself to the life of an armchair traveler, much like Huysmans's Des Esseintes in the novel A Rebours. In choosing not to travel, he withheld himself from contact with for- eign artists. Even at home, Ensor formed few friendships among Les XX or with other Belgian artists. Instead he found his supporters and friends among Belgian writers: Emile Verhaeren, Eugene Demolder, Maurice Maeter- linck, Georges Eekhoud, Emile Picard, Octave Maus, and Karel van de Woes- tyne. In fact, Ensor considered himself a writer as well as an artist.2 And in an interview in the month of his death, Ensor chose to stress the literary aspects of his art, which he described as "very much inclined towards literature. My paintings wander around painting."3 Although it is well known that Ensor read Balzac, Dante, Milton, Poe, and others,4 there is in his work a significant debt to Symbolist literature that has not been documented but that can be seen reflected in a number of drawings, prints, and paintings. This debt is under- standable in light of the fact that Ensor embraced the Belgian renaissance of letters, which celebrated Symbolist goals in avant-garde literary reviews and journals at the end of the nineteenth RIK i:::::: F 14S: a 01w: gzz::- *XAM?,,,' a~~DM..

This paper will examine that Symbol- ist side of Ensor's art. The writings of such Belgians as Picard and Albert Mockel, the work of the French novelist Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, and stories and essays published in French and Belgian journals will help explain some of Ensor's motifs and illuminate a fertile artistic exchange of the 1880s and 1890s. A significant influence on Ensor was F6licien Rops's journal, Uylenspie- gel, published between 1856 and 1864.6 It was filled with stories on art and literature, as well as political commen- tary, and it reported on art lectures given in Brussels. Fiction was also pub- lished, and a story from 1863, L6o Lespes's "Ce qui disent les meubles" ("What the Furniture Says"),7 can be seen as a prototype for later Symbolist literature. Like the old Swedish tale of animals who talked on Christmas Eve, this story tells of furniture that lived, knew all the secrets of its human cohabi- tants, and communicated on Christmas night. Lespes's tale may have inspired Ensor's development of a small body of work that dealt with quiet introspection and a suggestion of the supernatural. His 1885 painting Haunted Furniture (Fig. 1) shows an interior with an elabo- Summer 1985 99</page><page sequence="2">s`: -~ :i .:? ::i:_:i -: " :1 7- ~-JII?" Fig. 2.

Seated at a large table in the foreground, a young girl looks up and out at the viewer from a book she has been reading; to the left at the end of the table a woman, who appears to be Ensor's sister, Mitche, sits engrossed in her knitting. This scene of quiet domesticity is intruded upon by a number of masked faces and skulls that appear at the edges of the composition and seem to press inward towards the unsuspecting females. Next to the young girl is a skeleton; its head and shoulder appear just above the table, and its proximity to the seated figure is made all the more menacing by the girl's oblivious stare. The clarinet lying on the table recalls the horn held in the hand of " :5*?i:~i`i _d, r :Y *?URi *: 7 Fig. 3 Ensor, The Haunted Mantelpiece, 1888, colored pencil on wood, 24 x 16". Private collection. the masked intruder in Ensor's 1883 painting Scandalized Masks (see Fig. 9), which will be discussed later, and, like the horn in that painting, may refer to death; the snuffed candle at the far right suggests a similar meaning. The identity of the young girl is not known," but what is evident is that spec- ters haunt the room, and although they do not seem to be a part of the furniture itself, their presence, unnoticed, to- gether with the symbols on the table, makes the painting a pointed warning about remaining in that dangerous environment. Closer in actual visual description to the title of Haunted Furniture is Ensor's 1886 drawing, My Sad and Splendid Portrait (Fig. 2), in which Ensor's head and the suggestion of his shoulders float out from within the confines of the mas- sive carved armoire. Ensor's transub- stantiation has been sensitively de- scribed by Libby Tannenbaum: The artist superimposes his own brooding image on the great carved chest, as though in that room whose sullen women hiber- nated in slumber, the restless fur- niture was by contrast gloomily alive. The furniture and the artist were equally witnesses in this atmosphere from which Ensor was never to have the resolution to remove himself, and there is a sense of this identification in the way he invests the furniture with his own sense of horrors.9 The Haunted Mantelpiece from 1888 also fits this description (Fig. 3). It includes the heads of two women and the light sketch of a face above the mantel. In a little-known drawing of the same ili ~i ::Ile :7, e Fig. 4 Ensor, The Devil's Mirror, 1888, pencil and charcoal, 87/8 x 63/4". Private collection. year, a mirror reflects a ghoulish, Satanic presence with bulging eyeballs and horned protuberances (Fig. 4). This figure is surrounded by hybrid sea crea- tures, a lobster, anthropomorphic fish heads, and females, insect-like, yet sug- gestive of mermaids. Similar grotesque imagery appears repeatedly in Ensor's art, and Edmond Picard's observation from the 1887 Le Jure comes to mind: "Why should there not exist a world made up of invisible, odd, fantastic, embryonic beings?",,10 T here were abundant tales of the supernatural in Belgian journals and reviews born in the 1880s. L'Art moderne began publishing in 1881; under Picard and Maus it extolled the art of Les XX and reviewed such authors as Huysmans and Eekhoud. The small review L'Elan littbraire began in January of 1885. In its pages Mockel praised the originality of Ensor and Redon, and in 1886, when it changed its name to La Wallonie, it announced an alliance with Paris and the Symbolists, thus strengthening the French cultural connection that had antagonized Flem- ish Belgians. Verhaeren became its lead- ing poet, and Mockel continued his reviews. Mention should also be made of other significant Belgian journals: La Jeune Belgigue, La Reveue Belge, La Revue independante, and La Revue blanche, which moved to Paris in 1891. In January of 1887, the year Ensor began work on The Entry of Christ into Brussels and painted the nightmarish Tribulations of St. Anthony, L'Art moderne carried a three-page article entitled "Fantastic Reality."" It was the lead article, and, although published anonymously, it may have been written by Picard, since he was one of the main contributors to that periodical. The writer observed that the fantastic was constantly evolving everywhere, all around one, and that, like unknown con- tinents, it was a black region to explore, an underdeveloped area for art and literature.12 The message concerned the real world and the infusion of the fantastic into the ordinary. In an account that recalls what Ensor had already achieved in his 1886 drawing My Sad and Splendid Portrait, and that may have been an added impetus for the 1888 drawing Haunted Mantelpiece, as well as for the 1888 etching Haunted Furniture (Fig. 5) with its skeletal creature ges- turing from behind the armoire, the author describes what he perceives as "Fantastic Reality": here is the table, here is the writ- ing desk.... Nothing is sim- pler.... There had been a sighing 100 Art Journal</page><page sequence="3">b~ ; i ,!i -i'? i ~ -i ii  ... ....... ii ... .. ti i   ~.i... ; ,oi!! ..... +r '  ...

A piano string breaks and vibrates in its closed case. From a dormant rose in a vase, its petals fall .... Do I enter in the invisible world? No, it is reality. But seen reality felt in its enig- matic accidents.... Everything is vibrating with strangeness. The supernatural appeared under- neath this peaceful life.... But to discern that, it takes an aspect of a special spirit, and to realize it is a special art: ... Fantastic Reality.'3 The writer advised that mystery was the most profound way to excite human emotions, and he suggested that "clus- ters of obscurity" should remain within a creation: "May there always be a secret. Let a riddle live ... and to express it in its grimacing darkness, that is the art of fantasy."14 n 1887 there also appeared a novella, Les Fumistes wallons, that was quite remarkable in its assimilation of an incredible variety of images and motifs that would have interested Ensor. A "fumiste" is a practical joker, and in this story, written by Mockel under the pseudonym "L. Hemma," were refer- ences to Belgian journals, Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, bizarre furniture, skele- tons, mannequins, and the blind bour- geoisie. These concerns and others were woven into a work dedicated as a "story of some madmen by the maddest of them."'5 The description of an apartment cre- ates a mood similar to that of "Fantastic Reality": 17-:- Fig. 6 Ensor.

Francine-Claire Legrand has called this painting "the most beautiful of Ensor's bourgeois interiors," and she described it as "the most symbolic also, in the sense that the evocation of mystery is the very heart of Symbolism, and where the most simple mystery, a confrontation of bodies stripped of protective disguises, rejoins the symbolism of creation."'7 In Mockel's story the mood changes from poetic to raucous: the moon is seen as a luminous carnival mask, and the surging crowds are described in detail, suggesting Ensor's view of vulgarized humanity in his 1888 Entry of Christ into Brussels (Fig. 7): People went down to the fair.... An enormous wave of idlers surged confusedly on the boule- vards. A deep din swelled in the air, interrupted incessantly by the bumping noises of the orchestras whose rhythmic racket was halt- ingly seconded by the harsh shouts of the clown.'8 The crowd is seen as a swarming, idle mob, shops along the way are described by their signs and soiled banners, and the main characters watch a parade of grotesques: [a] great lady hiding a tumor in the fullness of her skirt, butchers, pastry cooks, journalists, and hyp- ocrites, all passed ... whereas, from the height of its bloody tribu- nal the clown bellowed in order to curse them with great bursts of resounding imprecations.'9 Mockel describes his tale as that of "a little marionette," and in it he writes of the Wallon movement, listing those writers to whom contemporary Belgian literature was indebted. He also writes of the plastic arts, praising Ensor's work along with that of Rops, Redon, and Khnopff,20 therefore acknowledging the intrinsic link between art and literature. As Mockel had been, so also was Maurice Maeterlinck drawn to the image of marionettes, and in 1894 he wrote three plays for them. In choosing marionettes as the most appropriate way to portray his archetypal figures, Mae- terlinck was close in spirit to Ensor, whose grotesques-costumed and masked with strange, lifeless gri- maces-sometimes looked and gestured like marionettes or puppets, as in his 1890 Intrigue (Fig. 8). In addition, Ensor may have directly influenced Maeterlinck. In Maeter- linck's dramas, such as the 1889 Intruder and The Blind from 1891, the use of light and darkness and sight and blindness, as well as doors, windows, and lamplight, is intensely symbolic, simple but profound in implication. In The Intruder, for example, the title charac- ter, who is Death itself, is never actually seen on stage, but is known by means of the tangible characters' developing awareness. Thus although personifica- tions of death abound, they are abstrac- tions. As Una Taylor has observed in her study of Maeterlinck, "the death they symbolize is within . .. the emblems are but masks thoughts put on."2" T his kind of symbolic presentation was already present in Ensor's remarkable painting from 1883, Scan- dalized Masks (Fig. 9). Although often considered a simple genre scene because of its very early date,22 this work in actuality depicts a sinister confronta- tion. In a bare room a single lamp illu- minates a wall with a rich warm light. Seated at a small table on which a half-filled bottle rests, a man in a smil- ing mask places his hands on the table top and looks up at a masked woman who has just entered the room through a doorway filled with a cold blue hue. When the canvas was first shown at an exhibition of Les XX, Ensor's full title was Scandalized Masks Mocking Death. And although "masques scan- dalis6s" may refer to shocked or scan- dalized masks, a Belgian writer noted that in Belgium when a mask frightened someone the word "scandalise" was used.23 Thus the true sense of the word may refer to a frightening confronta- tion, as well as to the original meaning of the word "scandalize," which sug- gests a shock to one's sense of propriety. Tannenbaum correctly described the scene as existing in "an aura of some mysteriously intimate evil."24 In numerous instances these masks reappear in Ensor's later oeuvre as members of his personal family of masks. The large-nosed male mask is similar to one with a pointed nose found among others in Ensor's home, but the female mask, with its distinctive round blue glasses, may be a construction from his imagination; there is no evidence that it ever existed. The standing figure has been identi- fied as Ensor's maternal grandmother, who continued to take part in carnivals j; : - : :: ::-- -:- 'i Fig. 9 Ensor, Scandalized Masks, 1883, oil on canvas, 53 x 443/4".

Wearing this mask she has been described by a Bel- gian historian as "the horrible old one of our nightmares and of our childhood fears. The Macaco sorcerer with its sickly and deceitful smile, who weakly extends the hand, but surely to grab you."25 In her right hand she holds a horn that can be played at carnival festivities. Although the horn's use may ultimately go back to that early tradi- tion of noisemakers meant to ward off evil spirits in pagan religious rites, it is also significant to recall that in the poetry of Jules Laforgue the horn announces death.26 And although the old woman comes in corporeal form, her presence anticipates Maeterlinck's later spectral harbinger of death in dramas like The Intruder. Another literary allusion is possible here. It comes from the work of the novelist Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, whose influence on the Symbolists is well known. In Villier's long story "Claire Lenoir," first published in 1867, there is a description of Lenoir that is tempting to link with Ensor's masked woman. Villiers describes her as a droll and sinister adulteress who had hidden behind blue spectacles.27 Huysmans later discussed her Symbolist appeal in his novel A Rebours, and was particu- larly fascinated by her eyeglasses, "as big and round as five-franc pieces cover- ing her lifeless eyes."28 The name "Le- noir" refers to Claire's blindness, and it is possible to imagine Ensor's intruding masked figure as Claire's spiritual sis- ter, her blue opaque round glasses hid- ing eyes that are blind to any virtues the seated masked man may have. Ensor's paintings of The Drunkards (1883; private collection) and The Sick Tramp (1882; destroyed World War II) anticipate Scandalized Masks through their treatment of a similar theme, but the most striking prototype exists in a drawing that was reproduced on a post- card found in the Ensor archive at Ostend's Stedelijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten (Fig. 10).29 To my knowledge the drawing has never been published. Its whereabouts is unknown, but its title, The Drinker, is inscribed in Ensor's handwriting at the bottom of the post- card. The seated figure, in its coarse clothing and hat, the narrow table, the singular bottle, even the suggestion of a doorway-all these elements become crucial to Scandalized Masks. Knowl- edge of Ensor's family suggests that the drama refers to his father's alcoholism and the tensions evident in family rela- tionships.30 English-born, unacceptable to the clannish Ostend community, and unemployed, Ensor's father was to die from alcoholism and exposure in the streets just four years after the painting. 54,! 45. :- V M i i`i ,iil! : Fig. 10 Postcard of Ensor drawing Le Buveur, c. 1882. Ostend, Archives, Stedelijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten. It is not Ensor's father who appears in Scandalized Masks, but rather a surro- gate figure whose presence achieves the same end. It may have been too painful for Ensor to paint his forty-eight-year- old father in that confrontation; in fact, this smiling mask, with its huge nose, gives the wearer an air of childish embarrassment, as if he had been caught by the intruder in a compromis- ing situation. The mask, which is used to hide one's identity, is a vehicle for escape. Once in place it is also a cover for indiscriminate behavior. Practiced by the old woman, the carnival masquer- ade remains a viable exercise in indul- gence and, by implication, accepted by church and community. Ironically, for the seated man, the mask fails to hide or protect. Trapped by his pathetic life and his vulnerable hidden self, Ensor's surro- gate father will not escape death, and all attempts to mock its presence, or thwart its inevitability, are in vain. During the early 1880s a number of Ensor's works deal with family relation- ships, and such paintings as Woman in Distress (1882; Paris, Musees Nation- aux) and Somber Lady (1881; Brussels, Mus6es Royaux des Beaux-Arts) hint at unhappiness and repression. In Scandal- ized Masks, however, Ensor includes an additional dimension to create an atmo- sphere filled with mystery and rich with universal as well as personal implica- tions. As this article has tried to show, works from the later 1880s, such as Haunted Furniture, My Sad and Splen- did Portrait, and Children Dressing, continue this direction. Through their visual poetics these pictures reveal Ensor's close affinity with Symbolist lit- erature and its significant antecedents.

Liege, Editions Nationales, 1974. As Ensor's artistic powers weakened, he wrote more. With the exception of his personal let- ters, the 1882 "Reflections on Art," and the 1884 "Three Weeks at the Academy," his published essays and various "Discours" and tributes were written in the late 1890s and into the first four decades of the twentieth century. 3 J.P.

In a remin- iscence of Ensor's atelier, the Ostend painter Jean-Jacques Gaillard described a large table piled with "old documents, articles and works cut from journals: La Flandre litteraire, Selec- tion, Die Kunst, and Europa" (Georges Fabry, Jean-Jacques Gaillard, le voyageur de la lumibre fantastique, Ostend, Editions Erel, n.d., p. 105). 6 Ensor's contact with Rops, who was twenty- seven years older than Ensor, was assured through Les XX, where they both exhibited, and through the writer Eugene Demolder, Ensor's friend and Rops's son-in-law. Ensor lists Rops among "The Classic Dozen," as one of the Belgian artists he most admired (Ensor [cited n. 4], p. 49). 7 Uylenspiegel: Journal des dbbats artistiques et littbraires, No. 39 (October 8, 1863), p.

Gert Schiff saw her as "The artist's sister intent upon her homework under the surveillance of a drowsy, knitting nurse" ("En- sor the Exorcist," Art the Ape of Nature. Studies in Honor of H. W. Janson, ed. Moshe Barasch and Lucy Freeman Sandler, New York, Harry N. Abrams, 1981, p. 722); but in 1885 Mitche's age would have coincided with that of the knitting woman (Stephen McGough has come to the same conclusion in "James Ensor's 'The Entry of Christ into Brussels in 1889,' "Ph.D. Dissertation, Stanford Universi- ty, 1981, p. 223, n. 144). 9 Tannenbaum (cited n. 8), p. 51.
