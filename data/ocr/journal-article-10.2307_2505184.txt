<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ESSAYS 357 ThE RHETORIC OF THE HUMAN SCIENCES. Language and Argument in Scholar- ship and Public Affairs. Edited by John S. Nelson. Madison, Wisconsin: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1987. Pp. xiii, 445. The contributors to this volume describe and praise rhetoric. They do not define it or offer a theory of it. Most of them indeed would regard it as a mistake of just the sort they are attacking to attempt such a thing. They show that argu- ments are not won, evidence recognized, or explanations accepted in accordance with the standard recipes of logic and scientific method, but by means of persua- sive pictures, metaphors, and analogies. Naturally what one wants to ask is: persuasive to whom? Persuasion depends on the persuaded as well as the persuader, the marveling audience as well as the discoverer, the pupil and teacher alike. Could Darwin have convinced anyone else, or for that matter himself, had not the ideas of competition and the survival of the fittest gained currency as a rationale for the unequal distribution of goods? Powerful rhetoric, of course, but put that way one wonders whether, in a different social context, the grand idea of evolution might remain wholly opaque, and Darwin's industrious collection of the evidence for species variation an inexplicable puzzle. The example comes to mind because two essays in this volume look at evolu- tion as rhetoric. In "Charles Darwin: Rhetorician of Science" John Angus Camp- bell shows how the novel theory of the Origins is grounded in and expressed by ordinary and natural speech -that is, "selection," "preservation" and "struggle" (70). Darwin, he says, was not at all fastidious about the use of anthropomorphic metaphors. They contributed beyond measure to the persuasiveness of his novel theory. I must complain parenthetically that someone so conscious, as Camp- bell is, of the importance of historical context to the understanding of a theory and its impact, should casually refer to a Cartesian billiard ball universe (79). Still, Campbell amply demonstrates that the Origins is indeed a rhetorical tour deforce. The trouble is, one doesn't quite see a connection between the rhetoric and scientific theory itself. It is as if the substance of science was after all quite immune to rhetorical analysis, as if form had nothing to do with content. Like other essays in this volume, his paper describes the presentation of a theory, con- ceding the account of its truth, verification, and logical inference to scientists themselves (perhaps) or certain kinds of philosophers with whom rhetoricians are on bad terms. This does not measure up to the intentions of the symposium, as I understand them. How should the symposium's aim be characterized? Years ago, in the pages of this journal, I attempted to obliterate another instance of the contrast be- tween substance and style.' I suggested that narrative was not simply a matter of an historian's choice of style - as if there were any number of optional forms available to express the same truths or opinions -but that thinking narratively 1.

Louch "History as Narrative," History and Theory 8 (1969), 54-70.</page><page sequence="2">358 REVIEW ESSAYS is a mode of coming to grips with and understanding a succession of historical events. (Herbert Butterfield once told me what Eamon de Valera said to him: if you knew the order of events you would understand.) Something like this is the project here. What needs answering, with respect to the Origin of Species, for example, is not the question, what rhetorical (adver- tising? dishonest?) skills Darwin used to convince the public, but how did (and do) the rhetorical features of Darwin's message enter into the process by which he came to formulate and we to understand and accept his theory. Several ven- tures in this volume fall short in this respect. In the essays on evolution and in others as well the perspective seems wall-eyed: to one side a project of scientific discovery and to the other a mode of affective representation, not unlike the con- ventional view of the media, which we believe subordinates content to the mode of presentation. These rhetoricians, it is true, mean to uncover a deeper relation between form and substance than my tentatively expressed qualms suggest. But they are -just possibly -led astray by the rhetoric of rhetoric itself. I put it this way without meaning to take anything away from the force and cogency of their collectively sponsored argument. But their pitch tempts the reader, and I think the writers as well, to a dualistic resolution of the interplay between substance and affect, between facticity and hyperbole. This is particularly evident in the other essay on Darwin by Misia Landau. In "Paradise Lost: The Theme of Terrestriality in Human Evolution" the De- scent of Man is carried along by the eschatological aura of the Fall. Further in- stances include the essays on mathematics (by Philip Davis and Reuben Hirsch) and history (by Allan Megill and Donald McCloskey). These essays stress the affective power of discourse, but in a way that divides what is said into two not quite related, or anyway uneasily related, parts - the polemical and factual, the subjective and algorithmic. On one side language is designed to convince, on the other to argue for and assess the truth. The Origin advances a profound and sweeping theory, and argues for it with a mass of detail. It was also promoted by skills that would earn millions on Madison Avenue. One must of course applaud the sensitivity shown by most of the participants in this colloquium to the nuances and subtleties of presentation. But the more successful they are in drawing attention to the rhetorical devices employed by scientists to persuade the lay public to subscribe to their revolutionary theories, the more the scientific, logical, or rational part of the scientist's work evades their rhetorician's reach. And this is hardly the effect these symposiasts hope for. They do not mean only to draw attention to the various arts and forms of paper writing for Nature, Scientific American, or those learned journals of endlessly prolifer- ating disciplines, subdisciplines and sub-sub-disciplines which paralyze synoptic thought. They have in mind a larger ambition, to show how rhetoric permeates logic. They do not mean to separate the logic of science from its rhetorical pre- sentation; they expect to fuse them. What a past generation or two or three thought was impeccably objective is in fact saturated with what these writers call -and we might as well too, at least for the moment -the rhetorical. Many of them</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW ESSAYS 359 say straight out that doing science is an essentially rhetorical activity. I take this to mean that the act of discovery or validation, of theoretical implication (or fabrication) is as much rhetorical as are the popular expositions of recondite theories. Science may look like a sequence of algorithms, but algorithms are them- selves rhetorical means of persuasion, the methods their audiences will accept. Physics, that bastion of scientific objectivity, is implicated in retailing rhetor- ical images as much as any less authoritative discipline. Isn't inertia, after all, as fundamentally rhetorical a conception as Hobbes's picture of isolated, fearful, and ambitious men? - Hobbesian man being, I assume, a readily acknowledged rhetorical image. Suppose we took it into our heads to doubt or deny the first law of motion. It would not be quite like - though maybe a bit like - denying that the world is round. All sorts of practical things -parts of typical human experience, come a cropper by denying the world is round: Ah, so you went from Los Angeles to New York, and then to London, Karachi, Singapore, Jahito, and Los Angeles again. Wonderful trip ... but did you go back over places you had seen before? Inertia is different, at least in degree. You experience it when the plane takes off, when, moving as fast as your legs will carry you, you want to stop, when you try to reverse direction, or roll the boulder out of its stubborn place in your garden. But of course you express-or can express-these facts in other ways: pressed back against the seat by the ascent, getting your legs to respond to your will, the bulk and heaviness of the boulder. The physicist's con- cept of inertia-which replaces our humdrum notion of rest with the idea of change of motion-is not plainly evident in the facts of experience. You must come to accept a picture of bodies in which not motion but change in velocity is central. Your physics professor tries to get across the meaning of inertia by anchoring his account to experiences of acceleration. But even so, the facts of acceleration (the plane taking off, the car coming to a sudden stop) do not add up to the first law of motion. Something else is required - an act of the imagina- tion, for lack of a better word, which makes possible Newton's perspicuous redescription of phenomena. Nothing extraordinary about this, you will say. We have just been reminded that a certain conception of science is wide of the mark, the idea that heaps of data will add up to laws of nature. And no one, you will add, makes that mistake any more - or do they? Cliometricians may. Our authors here label this miscon- ception with familiar slogans -positivism and scientism. And they seek allies in the war they wage against these villains just where one would expect, in the generation of philosophers whose thinking about the domains of knowledge and what it is to know was turned round by lessons learned from Wittgenstein, Austin, and Ryle. That generation included authors frequently or occasionally cited here: Russell Hanson, Thomas Kuhn, Stephen Toulmin.2 In Patterns of Scientific Dis- 2. It is odd, and a bit discouraging, to find no reference to Peter Winch, The Idea of a Social Science (London, 1958), where conceptual analysis plays much the role rhetoric is called upon to play here. I cannot claim indifference to their ignoring me either, though Explanation and Human Action (Oxford, 1967) presents an attack on their favorite targets in a manner rhetorical to a fault.</page><page sequence="4">360 REVIEW ESSAYS cover, Hanson argued than an algorithmic view of science, according to which descriptions of states of affairs stand in deductive or inductive relationship to covering laws, could not account for scientific discoveries. Advocates of the covering-law view -which may with some measure of accuracy be called "posi- tivistic" - are misled by their preoccupation with the picture of a completed science, requiring only precise, logical reformulation to perfect it. Discovery-advances or modifications in scientific theory - cannot be accounted for that way. Hanson's account of the discovery of the laws of motion was generalized in Kuhn's felicitous metaphor of paradigm shifts, which serves as the mainspring for the claims in the book under review on behalf of rhetoric in the human sciences. This is in part because paradigms are naturally thought of as pictures, and pic- tures can be persuasive or suggestive, and so eminently rhetorical. In part too the paradigm metaphor (itself an effective piece of rhetoric) has special impor- tance for these rhetoricians of the human sciences because it is a particularly powerful weapon against "positivistic" science. It shows that explanation in science depends on factors that cannot be predicted by scientific law or compendious algorithm. Dissident practitioners in behavioral science naturally find in the idea of a par- adigm shift a wonderful defense against the encroachments of "hard" science on their turf. They wage this war on the assumption that positivism is a recipe for doing science, a set of rules imposing an agenda and form on scientific re- search. In all fairness, however, we can't say that positivists or logical empiricists meant to offer a recipe for research. They sought a way of distinguishing genuine discoveries, theories, or explanations from their counterfeits. Whether they really had the credentials for this critical work is another question. Looking back on the heyday of positivism as an episode in intellectual history, one marvels at the authority the Wienerkreis managed to command. Perhaps it was because, in those days, philosophers were oppressively conscious of the cyclotron on the hill or the equations left on the blackboard by the physics professor in the class the hour before. The rhetoric of positivism put a good face on the behavioral sciences by applying the cosmetic of scientific method. The strictures of Ayer, Hempel, and Carnap could be read not only as critiques of the inadequacy of soft sciences, but as recipes for their success. So we needed Wittgenstein's reminders, and after his, Hanson's and Kuhn's, about the different domains of philosophy and physics. Criteria for perfecting or assessing theories cannot also function as methods for generating them. Witt- genstein's remarks of course challenged the criteriologist in any form. When he said, "mathematics must take care of itself," he drew attention to the impossi- bility of framing a set of internal standards -standards of mathematical ade- quacy -by which to judge the validity or the precision of mathematical infer- ences. A quarrel about an inference or a dispute must be settled by the principals in the debate, not their self-appointed seconds. So too Hanson and Kuhn meant Two books they discuss: N. R. Hanson, Patterns of Scientific Discovery (Cambridge, Eng., 1958), and Thomas Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Chicago, 1962).</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW ESSAYS 361 to probe the deeper (psychological?) assumptions that led an intellectual com- munity to endorse some inferential patterns or paradigms rather than others. They were not quarreling with what scientists actually do or argue about. Physics too should take care of itself. Kuhn's account of scientific revolutions quells the ambition to speak for science - past, present, and future, to reject claims about what science is or must be. This is the gospel of Rorty, whose genial comments in this volume in support of the "fuzzies" urge a laissez-faire conception of scientific enterprise - let a thousand theories bloom. But isn't this abdication or repudiation of responsibility as grandiose as the positivists' presumption to subject scientists to their rules? It is as insulting when Rorty tells them it is all right to do what they are doing as to be chastised by positivists who keep asking in their rude way whether they mean anything at all. Should social scientists or literary critics be grateful to Rorty for assuring them they can do what they want? Isn't he, as much as the positivist, playing the role of epistemological gatekeeper? On his own account of himself as philos- opher, this is a role he cannot assume, any more than the positivist can meddle in the physicist's business. How do philosophers succeed in appropriating the position -quite inappropri- ately, if Rorty is right -of credentialling job applicants for intellectual tasks? Well, they might say it is because they have a nose, or an ear, for the temptations of rhetoric. Positivists smell out (I change the senses to make the point that I don't know quite what the philosopher's credentials are) the rich and suffocating aroma of metaphysics: the temptation to talk about it all. This band of rhetori- cians tastes the acrid but addictive flavor of positivistic certainty and dogmatism and spews it out, calling our attention to more palatable foods. Some of us are old enough to have had and then learned to extinguish an appetite for the flavors of the lean and indigestible banquet to which positivists invite us. That appetite can easily be revived by the promise of Nobel prizes, fat research grants, and more abstruse equations on the blackboard - or more honestly, at the spectacle of a generation's abdication of intellectual responsibility, pursuing false or ephemeral gods. But surely the temptation toward positivism is quickened by the assumption, which could be wide of the mark, that physics, after all, is the dogmatic theology in our time. Those who think so look askance, though with the bare possibility of redemption, at the stumbling and groping efforts of other disciplines. Natural scientists, perceived this way, are the positivist enemy. That, I think, is how several of these symposiasts see them. An essay by Renato Rosaldo in this volume nourishes my suspicions. Rosaldo, an anthropologist, had a conversation with a physicist while driving through the fog on Route 17 between Santa Cruz and San Jose, a tortuous passage engraved on my memory from any number of harrowing experiences negotiating it. The reported conversation strikes me in consequence as somewhat implausible - implausible anywhere except perhaps the artificial context of a meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association. I hope he forgives me my skepticism with regard to a matter that might be thought to be trivial and irrelevant. But one</page><page sequence="6">362 REVIEW ESSAYS sees (as a matter of rhetoric) that it is essential that such a conversation should naturally occur, whether while negotiating the exciting curves and grades of Route 17 or enduring discomfort in some dreary conference room. The rhetorical force Rosaldo hopes to gain by retailing this conversation depends on his physicist in- terlocutor being so positivistically rude as to ask him what he, or anthropolo- gists generally, discover: a law of cultures, for example (87)? Are there scientists, I wonder, who hold that only lawlike generalizations count as knowledge, or as worth knowing or spending the time and money to discover? Maybe so, but it strikes me that a more likely fellow-traveler demanding those credentials of a defensive anthropologist is the ghost of Carnap, an unamiable companion on Route 17. And this accounts for a certain fustian quality to the rhetorician's at- tack on positivistic science. Are they tilting at windmills? The answer is: not windmills exactly, but any number of human scientists them- selves, who still learn bowdlerized versions of Ayer or Carnap, and read their logical exercises as though they were cookbooks, chock full of recipes for whip- ping up scientific theories. So one can more easily imagine a pair of psycholo- gists, sociologists, or political scientists asking each other whether they had dis- covered any new laws lately (though it would be a bad joke) than a physicist mouthing the old slogans of the Vienna Circle and their mistaken emulators in the behavioral sciences. Of course I don't question Rosaldo's veracity - only the plausibility that a physicist should have belabored him this way. Perhaps I am wrong. Maybe physicists, when they reflect on what they do, are positivists. Some would see this as a vindication of positivism. They would say, these positivist-minded scientists produce the results after all; if Carnap is their recipe book, why, so much the better for Carnap. Others would say, there is no necessary connection between the analysis of science and its practice. In Koest- ler's famous phrase, scientists are sleepwalkers, moving intuitively to avoid falling down the stairs logicians of science can point out to them from the blueprints to the house. The rhetoricians represented in this volume tend to believe both these things. They want to say that the study of human affairs suffers from mis- placed adulation of positivist (or natural) science. Positivism is the current enemy, not because Carnap continues to be quoted as gospel in scientific rituals, but because science is positivistic. They also want to say that positivism, as a creed or an analysis, is more broadly mischievous, addling the minds of physicists as well as philosophers, biologists, and social scientists alike. This is ambivalence which extends to the accounts of rhetoric itself. Those assigned the task of locating, or celebrating, the rhetorical aspect of mathematics or biology (why didn't they find someone to represent physics or paleontology?) tend to assign to rhetoricians a public relations function. I have commented on this already, remarking that the real work of scientific discovery and validation in these accounts is left to the scientists, with only the domain of publicity as- signed to the rhetorician. Of course Darwin worked to create an accepting au- dience, and of course the popular success of his view was ultimately connected with his adept use of rhetorical devices. But did he do other than present his</page><page sequence="7">REVIEW ESSAYS 363 thought in images which would convince his audience after having arrived at his theory by nonrhetorical means? These are no more than accounts of scientific style-theories of scientific representation. A more exciting claim shows instead how rhetoric shapes evi- dence and theories. Rhetoric is not merely a matter of delivery, but of discovery. Somehow modes of representation in the human sciences are integral to the pro- cess of explaining what people do. But this claim is made much more strongly for the human than the natural sciences. This is an ambivalence about rhetoric itself. Rhetoric is a good thing, they say, because the human sciences (at least) can only make progress by consciously assuming a rhetorical posture. But, then, the effect of positivist dogma on the human sciences is itself rhetorical. So there is good and bad rhetoric. It can mis- lead and mesmerize as well as illuminate and guide. Which is which? A simple test: ask whether we have learned anything from the modeling theorists in polit- ical science, the lawlike generalizers in sociology, the critical theorists in litera- ture. The answer is also an answer to Rorty's question: what is it we want to know? Have physics-aping theorists in the social sciences informed us about any matter that concerns us? (or are they more like the primitives who decorate their walls with theorems from the calculus? Are they doing math?) If we say we learn nothing we want to know from them, we may want to ask what motivates them to such extraordinary feats of intellectual posturing? And perhaps the answer is: they are victims of bad rhetoric, misleading analogies. Unfortunately, if "we" are Richard Nixon and Maggie Thatcher, we should worry lest we throw out the baby with the bath. I will return to the vital question -for Wittgenstein and Kuhn as well as the contributors to this volume -in a moment. The point is whatever strikes us as a non-answer to our question - who we are - becomes the object of diagnosis: a faulty rhetoric, a wrongheaded paradigm, at work. Rhetoric is an integral part of misunderstanding as much as it is of understanding. So every- thing seems to depend on who is asking the question. Is it the intellectual com- munity defined, with some suspicion of circularity, as those who know? The problem, the way out of it or its evasion, is one of Wittgenstein's projects. His answer seems sometimes to make ambitious claims for what it is to be human -and at others more modest claims about the character of a culture. If we divide over questions of authority or expertise our disagreement can only be settled by reminding ourselves what it is to be human (or an Englishman, Azande, and so on).3 The reminders, though, must themselves have authority. How shall we say our species-wide or cultural affirmations are not themselves skewed, for good or ill, by our rhetoric? It is at least an irony to have to think of our knowledge of phys- ical laws, which we imagine we know best, as dependent on our cultural or human identity, about which we can claim so little certainty or agreement. Wittgenstein does not speak explicitly of rhetoric; nor does Kuhn, whose paradigms also entail a deep acquaintance with our culture. In his essay in this 3. Cf.

The processes which uncover or apply our assumptions he calls a "conversation" - a special kind of conversa- tion, I imagine, in which disputants work toward agreement and a deeper under- standing of what they agree to mean. Perhaps this is what Plato meant by dialectic - the philosopher kings will speak to one another in a way that continu- ally draws attention to and sharpens their focus on how to do things with words. But it is not altogether obvious why a term with associations that distinguish it from logic is quite right for an activity that could be called logical as much as it could be called rhetorical -except, of course, that the process is seen as es- sentially social. I am not sure how far the company Rorty keeps shares his preoccupation with deeper and more pervasive problems of epistemology. As I have suggested, for many of them rhetoric is a matter of delivery rather than discovery. On one or two occasions, particularly in the final essay by John Nelson, one senses though that close scrutiny of representations is about to give birth to another set of bu- reaucratic rules-a new methodology of the social sciences, though based on "moral and political" foundations (426). This is a prospect Rorty's "fuzzies"- the genial way he refers to himself and others of like mind-cannot help but view with dismay. They would see it as strait-jacketing inquiry by the bureaucracy of knowledge. But the temptation toward methodology arises from preoccupa- tion with the form of representation, which, as a result, acquires status, possibly unintentionally, as an object of inquiry. Each of the disciplines harbors a poten- tial metadiscipline -the study of how one presents what is known or believed - which builds on and in some cases suffocates the activity that gave birth to it. You criticize a literary work and then ask, what is it to criticize, and so on ad nauseam. The essay on mathematics in this volume is a good example - describing from a not entirely obvious perspective what mathematics looks like. It is not mathematics but what exactly is it? The closest answer I can give is literary criti- cism. There is no foreseeable end to this process. It is a technique its contem- porary practitioners should patent and sell to union leaders seeking ways to justify featherbedding. The essays in this volume, so far as they constitute a prolegomenon to future human science, run the risk of endless adumbration on the question what is it to do history, anthropology, economics, and so on. But it must be said that on occa- sion the question points to momentous issues in the practice of a discipline, even to the point of questioning its coherence, or its purpose. In "The Rhetoric of History," for example, Allan Megill and Donald McCloskey ask: "How then is history to create worthy audiences?" (235)- an interesting question all too easy to answer the wrong way. It may be read plaintively: everyone used to read his- tory, now historians write for each other. (Philosophers could say the same, and critics. And now even the novel threatens to become academic.) I recall a confer- ence where Hayden White (referred to with cautious commendation here as the</page><page sequence="9">REVIEW ESSAYS 365 theoretician of the historian's rhetoric) voiced such a complaint.4 It used to be the case, he said, that historians spoke for their culture, inculcating the sense of public virtue so indispensable to national life and purpose. Historians, he went on, have lost that vocation; our generation is indifferent to tradition and uncom- fortable with manifestations of cultural hyperbole. So they have become social scientists for whom the accumulation of fact is its own justification, and Hempel their apologist. When Megill and McCloskey urge the recovery of the historian's rhetoric, they seem to be looking back wistfully to a time when the historian was the spokesperson for a culture - Trevelyan being, just possibly, the last of this breed. If so it won't do simply to advise historians to liven up their presenta- tions, introduce a bit of color, learn again how to tell a story. There has to be a story to tell, and this is not merely a matter of the writer's art. It depends on how and in what way the past is important to the literate public. Rhetoric is the hearer's art as much as the speaker's. So it may be that students, and advocates, of rhetoric have got the story back- ward. We have not lost the capacity for rhetoric because we have been bemused by the manuals of positivist science. Positivism arose because the rhetoric and the civilization it promoted failed. We live, Wittgenstein said somewhere, in an age of popular science; it is no time for philosophy -or history, he might have added, or any domain that celebrates the human. And you won't (he might have said as well) restore a vanished culture by forsaking algorithms for manuals of style. Rorty remarks: we may not want from sociology or literary criticism what we want from natural science, or the same kind of theory from different inquiries into the human (46). Rhetoric in its most frequent and constructive employment at this conference is a (rhetorical) reminder of intellectual diversity, not a new or different orthodoxy. But Rorty also speaks of solidarity, and of natural science as the model for disciplined listening and speaking out. In saying so he concedes (as evidently Wittgenstein did as well) that inquiry makes no sense outside a social structure, and that knowledge must have its bureaucratic side (45-46). He lets on that solidarity-the area of fundamental agreement that makes sense out of babble - is somehow an inevitable outcome of free and unconstrained conversation. I am con- stantly reminded, in reading Rorty, of the likeness between his society of friendly inquirers and Rawls's protocitizens, meeting to speak their minds and listen, at- tentively and responsively, to the words of others as they debate the rules proper to a just society. There is, I think, in both the scientific and political versions of liberalism, the undeclared assumption that we are really alike, and sufficiently tolerant of one another to make conversation mutually productive and enjoy- able. Rhetoric in such settings is of course benign -though we had, by some ruse, to exclude the positivists. But are these amiable people our neighbors? At times they are, and then we can view with equanimity the uncertain outcome of their chatter and our own. When they are not - well, don't we all want in reserve some 4.
