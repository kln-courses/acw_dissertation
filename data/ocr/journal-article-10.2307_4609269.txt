<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PHILOSOPHY OF WHITEHEAD By VICTOR LOWE Philosophy is the product of wonder. The effort after the general character- ization of the wtvorld around us is the romance of human thought. The correct statement seems so easy, so obvious, and yet it is always eluding us. We inherit the traditional doctrine: we can detect the oversights, the superstitions, the rash generalizations of the past ages. We know so well what we mean and yet we remain so cuiriously uncertain about the formulation of any detail of our knovledge.... We have to analyze and to abstract, and to understand the natural status of our abstractions. A civilization which cannot burst through its current abstractions is doonmed to sterility after a very limited period of progress. T HESE SENTENCES SHINE with the self-evidence that only genius can effect. And they are words spoken for our time. When Alfred North Whitehead died on December thirtieth he was in his eighty- seventh year; but it is barely twenty years since he wrote the books that made him first among metaphysicians. He was then teaching at Harvard, and I remember how he used to walk through the Yard: a little apple- cheeked man, his shoulders much bent, an umbrella often held across his back; his head down, but his bright eyes up. I cannot describe his face; I can only confirm Edmund Wilson's word that when you looked at him you felt that you were seeing a real face, in comparison with which all others looked like mere masks. The general impression given by Whitehead's presence, I should say, was one of vigor, kindness, and wisdom. Both his conversation and his writings showed a wonderful combination of urbanity and zest, like the tone of Plato's dialogues. He VICTOR LOWE'S interest in philosophy came after he had been educated as an electrical engineer. He studied under Whitehead and has previously written both of him and of William James. He believes Whitehead the greatest of modern philosophers but is no disciple, judging Whitehead's philosophy not naturalistic enough and preferring to see it revised in that direction. He has taught philosophy at Syracuse and Ohio State, is now associate professor at the Johns Hopkins University. 223</page><page sequence="2">THE ANTIOCH REVIEW loved to follow the minds of young people, and when you came to him to "have a chat" about his philosophy, the meeting always began with the eager question, "Tell me what you've been doing." He was born into a family of schoolmasters and clergymen in the county of Kent. At Trinity College, Cambridge (Isaac Newton's college) he never heard a lecture on any subject other than mathematics, and for the next forty years he was a professional mathematician. Yet he early, and without benefit of professors, knew by heart much of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. The students of that day covered everything in their reading and conversation-philosophy, religion, poetry, history, politics. Alfred Whitehead belonged to a famous discussion club, originally started by Tennyson and his friends. And during most of his thirty years at the University of Cambridge he did a good deal of political speaking: he has remarked that he was often covered with rotten eggs and oranges. At the close of the first World War he was one of the men who ran the huge University of London. Now, to his already published Treatise on Universa Algebra and the monumental Principia Mathematica (writ- ten in collaboration with his most brilliant pupil, Bertrand Russell) he added three books devoted to developing and applying a philosophical basis for relativity physics, and a volume of essays on education. These, and the known breadth of his mind, led to an invitation to teach philos- ophy at Harvard. So at the age of sixty-three he crossed the Atlantic and became professionally a philosopher. After thirteen years of extraordina- rily successful teaching, he retired to spend the rest of his days in a small apartment near the Yard. As a mathematician, Whitehead had not been trying to add to the superstructure of this science, so much as to find ideas broad enough to contain, as various instances, the concepts of arithmetic, geometry, and so on, which had been considered irreducibly basic. To Whitehead's mind, if not to Russell's, this sort of task is not so very different, except technically, from building a philosophical system. And throughout those forty years as a mathematician, in his conversations and reflections he had been touching on all the conditions involved in human existence. The exchange of a mathematical for a philosophical professorship was his opportunity to formulate the results. So, in 1925, Science and the Modern World appeared. This book, a beautifully written historical criticism which contains the opening sketches 224</page><page sequence="3">THE PHILOSOPHY OF WHITEHEAD of Whlitehead's metaphysics, is at once exciting and difficult. John Dewey was among the many reviewers who hailed it. Herbert Read called it the most important contribution to the joint field of science and philosophy since Descartes published his Discourse on Method in I637. Though this remains hiis most influential book, Process and Reality (1929) iS of greater permanent value, because it presents his system in full. The book is about as long as the Critique of Pure Reason, and quite as backbreaking. Pity thle poor souls who, encouraged by an enjoyment of Jeans or Eddington, bought it in the expectation of being similarly entertained. Early in 1933 Whitehead completed a kind of trilogy with a third stout volume, Adventures of Ideas. This, which I think was his own favorite, is probably the layman's best choice. It discusses many sides of human experience; as with Plato's Republic, it is almost impossible to specify the subject of the book as a whole. Perhaps we may say that its clhief topic is the sort of history which general ideas about the human race and about the cosmos have had and can have in Western civiliza- tion. A restatement of the main thought of Process and Reality provides a basis for the unforgettable conclusion of Adventures in a brief but pro- found analysis of the qualities which are essential to civilized life: truth, beauty, art, adventure, and peace-not the peace of nations, but the peace of the soul. "Philosophy" is a word that we in America use a good deal; but the philosophies we talk about are fragmentary creations limited by the word of. We have our favorite philosophies of education, of government, of this, of that; but the wide integrating system which shall embrace the whole show is not in the habit of our generation. We have made a virtue of the most provinlcial anthropomorphism, of the short-term considera- tion. Whitehead stands out because he was up to doing the big job. In putting out these results, four strong imnpressions dominate my mind: First, that the movemiient of historical, and philosophical, criticism of detached questions, which on the whole has dominated the last two centuries, has done its work, and requires to be supplemented by a more sustained effort of con- structive thought. Secondly, that the true method of philosophical construction is to frame a scheme of ideas, the best that one can, and unflinchingly to explore the interpretation of experience in terms of that scheme. Thirdly, that all constructive thought, on the various special topics of scientific interest, is dominated by some such scheme, unacknowledged, but no less influential in guiding the imagination. The importance of philosophy lies in its sustained 225</page><page sequence="4">THE ANTIOCH REVIEW effort to make such schemes explicit, and thereby capable of criticism aild improvement. There remains the final reflection, how shallow, puny and imperfect are efforts to sound the depths in the nature or things. In philosophical discussion, the merest hint of dogmatic certainty as to finality of statement is an exhibition of folly. The main reason why it is hard to understand Whitehead is that we naturally suppose we already have in our conscious possession all the fun- damental ideas which are applicable to human experience. The usages of language, as he says, enshrine the old patterns of thought, so that language has to be given a novel twist if a new idea is to be accurately expressed. A genuinely new philosophy is the hardest thing in the world to read. Complaints against Whitehead on this score have been legion. He has become the most quoted and the least accepted of twentieth- century thinkers. His wrork is exciting because of thc way in which he depicts reality; and because he depicts reality, not man alone. In this philosophy, the basic fact is everywhere some process of self-realization, which grows out of previous processes and itself adds a new pulse of individuality and a new value to the world. Nothing that exists is completely passive and inert. But Whitehead is not playing the old game of pushing "matter" out of the way in order to give the prime place to eternal spirit. He sides with Dewey against the orthodox tradition which set up some being at once infinite and changeless as the sole repository of reality and value. Reality and value lie only in emergent pulsations of individuality. But can you construct a system of the world on this basis? The amazing thing is that Whitehead did just that. II He began with physical nature. Our current world-picture still ne- flects the science of Isaac Newton. Though the physicist knows better, the rest of us think of the universe as a shifting configuration of perma- nent things. We should think of it as a nexus of events or processes. Think of the existence of a mountain as a long process, and of an individual atom in the mountain as a connected series of vibratory processes. We used to picture matter as there, in a continuous existence and at any given instant, but now we cannot say that the atom exists in any less time than the vibration-period which is its unit of being. And of course "mass" no 226</page><page sequence="5">THE PHILOSOPHY OF WHITEHEAD longer means "permanent quantity of matter." It is, as Whitehead says, "the name for a quantity of energy considered in relation to some of its dynamical effects"; and energy "is merely the name for the quantitative aspect of a structure of happenings." When a particular structure persists throughout a connected series of events, we speak of an enduring material "thing"; when the pattern of activity changes drastically we say, there's an end of that thing. The property of permanence, relative permanence that is, belongs to the form of process; and it is by this form, within the larger patterns of its environment, that we distinguish one atom from another, and both from a mountain or a frog. Through the ages new types of pattern evolve, and in Whitehead's broad view there is none that may not be replaced by some other in the endless history of the universe. As long as we thought in terms of things, it was natural to look upon the things that were real as those that were independent of their sur- roundings. In the Newtonian physics a massy particle had its location altered by the other particles in the universe, but not its essential nature. In the popular mind, Daddy Warbucks is a real man because he is self- sufficient and unchanging. Many philosophers have produced definitions of "creality" which merely glorify such independent existence. Language, with its separate words for separate things, strengthens this habit *of thought. But the attitude becomes difficult once we shift our basic concept from things to process. Historical context is now emphasized; the primary constituents of every event are the threads which come to it from earlier events, and live anew in it. Yet the process of nature is not sheer contiuity. It is always atom- ized, quantized, into natural units of process.;The threads converge and individuality appears in the rhythm of change. First we have the initia- tion of a quantic event by its environment, then the full emergence of that particular event, with its own distinctive character as a new synthe- sis of energies; and finally, as the world-process moves on to its next creation, that synthesis lapses, becomes mere material for the building of the future. Its sources and effects spread out to infinity; in its moment of life the event is just its own limited self, here and now, a unique, exclusive, individual fact. If, with Whitehead, you turn from the physical world to consider the way in which your own immediate experiences occur, you will notice a similar rhythm of wide public origin, concentrated individuality, and 227</page><page sequence="6">THE ANTIOCH REVIEW spreading public effect. Your experience now, though you may not con- sciously separate it from those that immediately precede and follow, still has. a unity of its own. In its short life-what psychologists call "the specious present"-it arises as a synthesis of nerve-impulses, of the mental intentions of preceding moments of experience, of conscious and sub- conscious emotions and attitudes. All these factors have derived their substance from innumerable earlier processes inside and outside of you. Your present experience, as a whole, is another process-a synthesizing process of feeling this wide environment, that is, of bringing its factors to a new head, self-enclosed and privately enjoyed. Its formation com- pleted, this "drop of experience"-William James's phrase, adopted by Whitehead-becomes a fact of history, part of the unalterable context of your future existence and mine; in short, a cause with observable effects. The end of its life is the beginning of its career. That is how we experience the irreversibility of time. If these appear obvious generalities, so much the better. Philosophers have no private information here. Their business, if they would think concretely, is to describe the common texture of these drops of experience, which are the immediate realities of our life. This texture we all enjoy, but do not think about because it is always right under our noses. So its true description, once achieved, is bound to appear obvious. The general account is what is so hard to draw up. There is a constant temptation to take a part for the whole: your sharp consciousness of sensations and images, if you are introspective or literary; a succession of causal reactions, if you run to behavior-science. "Pulse of experience" is in some ways a better metaphor than "drop," because we picture drops as being formed, whereas every experience is itself active. We entertain in our thought, and partly realize in our action, novel possibilities which cannot be absorbed from the environment be- cause they do not exist there. This is rnot confined to men of genius. A capacity for the spontaneous introduction of new content is part of the structure of every experience. Otherwise the present would be only the sum of what was given it by the past, and any item, taken by itself, a mere re-enaction. Even when you are consciously entertaining no new idea and the environment seems to be supplying all the material for your experience, the question of exactly how this material, donated by the past, shall be absorbed and felt, what shall be neglected and what em- 228</page><page sequence="7">THE PHILOSOPHY OF WHITEHEAD phasized, is finally decided only by that nascent moment of existence. That unity of feeling never existed before. A pulse of existence does, in miniature, what a human being normally accomplishes in the course of his life: the world gives him his material, his many alternative poten- tialities, and of these he fashions his personality, which embodies the perspective and the feeling with which he now takes in the world. So does each pulse of experience unwittingly create its own final unity, complete its own perspective of the world. It brings into being a slightly, sometimes substantially, novel pattern of integrated feeling. This is an aesthetic achievement. So beauty is, basically, the uncon- scious aim of each moment of our existence-beauty of some sort, that is, for there are many modes of beauty, not mutually consistent. The in- trinsic value of each pulse of experience is a function of its inclusions; of the exclusions which are equally essential to achievement; of the internal qualitative contrasts, complexity, intensity, and breadth of the pattern of feeling. This is Whitehead's account of the essential value of sheer exist- ence. Our discussions of human life are often based on the premise that "existence is good"; but we are so concerned with the fluctuations of fortune that we forget the perpetual aesthetic creation of each moment. Finally, since, within limits imposed by the environment, every ex- perience is self-creative, it is indirectly creative of the future. Directly, too, for every moment includes some anticipatory forward thrust, or purpose. III At this point our story is in danger of being permanently divided into a story of purposive, creative activity applicable to human experience but not to nature, and a story of external compulsions applicable to the things of nature but not completely to human experience. This separation has been the headache of philosophers for the last three centuries. If purposive activity does not occur in nonhuman nature, then the prag- matist does not solve the problem by viewing the science of nature as an instrument for effecting human purposes. He produces another man- glorifying dualism. The older dualism, following the lead of Immanuel Kant, held that to the scientist every event, inanimate or human, is bound to appear mechanically caused in its entirety; yet the moralist is bound to think of right and wrong as freely done; and the two beliefs do not really conflict, 229</page><page sequence="8">THE ANTIOCH REVIEW they are merely asserted from different points of view. We have all heard the problem of science versus religion solved in a similar way. Whitehead believed that this is a bogus solution. Our life is one life; you cannot parcel it out to thinkers sworn not to interfere with each other. Causality and freedom, like all fundamental contrasts, are in existence itself. You cannot reconcile them by distinguishing points of view, but only by find- ing a way to think them together. This particular contrast is but one feature of the gap between in- animate nature and human experience. That is the gap the philosopher must bridge, and Whitehead faced the fact that this requires general concepts which apply to both extremes. The physicist's concepts of physi- cal existence won't do the job, because they omit altogether the existence of experiences. On the other hand it would be fantastic to generalize, as metaphysicians so often have, from what is peculiar to man or only fit- fully exhibited by him-from such traits as his consciousness, sense- perception, or thought. But every quantic event in the universe may at least be thought of as in itself a pulse of experience of a primitive sort, an individual feeling of and reaction to its environment; and this is Whitehead's bold hypothesis: here is his "pluralistic universe."' Each of these pulses of experience occurs as an atom of process, in- tegrative or convergent in shape. Causation, then, is the principle of transition from atoms of process achieved to an atom of process begin- ning, on which they impose their individual characters, just as your experiences of a second ago automatically become part of your present existence. And the internal principle, consciously or (in the great ma- jority of cases) unconsciously operating in each atom of process, is its individual measure-slight or considerable-of self-creation, by which the process concludes in one way rather than another, and feels itself a new member of the universe. Causation means conditions, conditions imposed by the environment; but conditions do not unify themselves into a novel individual. Without the internal principle of selfW-creation, there would be no individual pulses of existence and no individual responsi- bility in our lives, but only a continuous flow of energy. There is no 'William James wrote a book with this phrase for its title, but he never said what the universe was a plurality of. The published and unpublished writings of his last five years, however, contain indications that he would have accepted Whitehead's hypothesis. 230</page><page sequence="9">THE PHILOSOPHY OF WHITEHEAD creation without creators, and every new actuality is here and now in some degree creative. Whitehead did not put out a bare hypothesis, but a developed theory, the first of its kind. Into it he fitted the general concepts of physics: space- time, motion, causality, quantization, vibration, matter, energy flow, and energy transformation. His familiarity with natural science enabled him to follow the contours of nature, and to suggest how, within the frame- work of his hypothesis, we may distinguish molecules, stones, single living cells, trees, animals, and persons as different organizations-"societies," he calls them-of primitive or complex drops of experience. Five years ago an Australian zoologist, W. E. Agar, wrote A Contribution to the Thcory of the Living Organism. This book is largely an application of Wilitehead's principles. If you do not like Whitehead's hypothesis, suppose you try to frame a better one. It is generally recognized that the entities conceived by physics are abstractions. What then are the more complete things from which the abstractions are made? Anybody can raise a cry about "the omissions of science," but Whitehead has offered an account of the totality. Though every pulse of existence enjoys a certain autonomy, among inanimate things this, like many autonomies in human affairs, generally conforms to established patterns; and the flash of individual experience in each pulse is negligible for the science which is tracing a transmission of energy up to an observer in a laboratory. In Whitehead's system there is, I believe, no contradiction of any confirmed result of science. There is an addition to what science says. Without this addition, we slip back into a dualist world, and man himself becomes divided. With it, a unity of interpretation comes in at the ground floor. I mean that man's union with organic nature is not just a scientific fact the reality of which no one could have felt before Darwin wrote; it is the basic fact of our existence, and it is perpetually evidenced by the feeling-"vague but insistent," as Whitehead liked to say-that our every experience derives from a natural world of "throbbing actualities" whose reality is of the same sort as our own.2 2We do not usually extend this feeling to such things as stones, but then a stone is not a true individual. The passive uniformity of its behavior, which alone our eyes are designed to perceive directly, is the result of an averaging-out process which masks the incessant activities of the individual atoms. 231</page><page sequence="10">THE ANTIOCH REVIEW Our reluctance to admit that any beings other than ourselves and our animal pets have experiences is not eiitirely due to unimaginativeness. The elemental feeling of the living universe "begetting us" becomes sub- merged as the autonomous element in each pulse of experience rises to dominance: that pulse feels the creativeness of nature here and now as its own possession, and the wide universe comes to appear as a collection of things laid out in its immediate neighborhood for it to act upon. In the language of the existentialists, it calls itself "spirit," everything else 4'thing" or "object." This division is a real phenomenon of human con- sciousness, and it may take on a myriad fascinating forms. Fasten upon them, dismiss the universe, and you are ready to join this new anti- naturalistic school of which we hear so much. Such popularity is the reward of narrowness. A new philosophy which is broad enough to reflect many facets of existence will have many enemies. How many people will go into a rage when they read of ele- mental feelings, "vague but insistent"! They cannot believe that what is clear in consciousness might be superficial in our existence; that what they are reading is anything but another mystical irrationalism designed to justify brutalities in action. And the scientist is likely to conclude that Whitehead's cosmology is an attempt to dictate principles to him. But that is today the special privilege of dialectical materialism; Whitehead did not desire it. Natural science remains, in his view, the systematic study of the causal connections between events. But Whitehead has made it possible for thinking man once more to enjoy his organic relationship with nature: to be a Wordswortliian-Wordsworth probably influenced Whitehead as much as any philosopher did, Plato excepted-or to respond to D. H. Lawrence's feeling for nature, without having to swallow that poet's antiscientific extravagances. Whitehead's offering is a frame of reference in which there is ample room for the scientist, the poet, and the natural man. IV Whitehead's metaphysics reconciles our beliefs that individuality, interdependence, and growth are fundamental ideas. The members of his pluralistic universe are organically connected by the fact that each is a growing together-a "concrescence"-of earlier ones into a new unity of existence. In Process and Reality Whitehead proposed principles governing every concrescence and a theory of the stages into which each 232</page><page sequence="11">THE PHILOSOPHY OF WHIITEHEAD is analyzable. Anyone can put a halo around "growth"; this philosophy is a universal theory of growth-quanta as the cells of the universe. We find this amazing because we are used to the timid assumption that only mechanical movement and causal connections can be analyzed. Whitehead makes his principles of growth and of dependent indi- viduality perfectly universal. His system includes a concept of God; but even God is dependent on the individual processes of the world for the perpetual completion of his being. He is not self-sufficient, and they are as real as he. Nor is God omnipotent. Whitehead was convinced that the finer religious insight sees the divine agency in the universe as persuasive, not coercive; persuading by the attraction of the ideals, the new possibili- ties of value, which it offers to the finite individuals of the wvorld as they, rising into being, choose just what they shall be, and thereby what they shall offer to the infinite filture. In this way God, and the environment consisting of the totality of already completed finite processes, together make up the infinite background from which a new event emerges. Upon its completion, this event becomes part of God's experience, thus acquiring a further unity with all the others that have ever been. They -are now all included in an infinitely wide harmony of feeling which grows without fading. In this doctrine Whitehead thinks he is closer to F. H. Bradley than to any other philosopher. The doctrine reflects his acceptance of the religious intuition of a kingdom of heaven. Skeptics may reject it, while retaining Whitehead's conception of the rhythm of immanence and individuality in the temporal world. For Whitehead, the temporal world itself involves more than process. While "the flux of things is one ultimate generalization around which we must weave our philosophical system," he also believes that "the alternative metaphysical doctrine, of reality devoid of process, would never have held the belief of great men, unless it expressed some funda- mental aspect of our experience." Whitehead fashions his adjustment of this antithesis by interpreting the creativeness of individual processes as a desire to embody ideal patterns which are eternally ordered in God's experience, and which as patterns do not change. Thus "the things which are temporal arise by their participation in the things which are eternal." Without the latter, Whitehead thinks, definiteness and novelty in the temporal world would be inconceivable. 233</page><page sequence="12">THE ANTIOCH REVIEW The contrasts with existentialism, and with the philosophy of John Dewey, are obvious. For good or for ill, the most gifted systematic philos- opher of our time was born a Platonist-not the arrogant unimaginative kind who by God tell you what the eternal truths are, but the kind whose imaginations are widened by the thought of countless ideal patterns in the background of actual existence. Such men are Platonists out of humil- ity; they cannot give themselves the whole credit for their creativeness, but must say that they have merely drawn on this boundless realm of ideality, merely realized a value. Whitehead's Platonism did not in the least lessen, but enhanced, his keen appreciation of change, of novelty, of transient experience. His writings are full of such phrases as "the final good of immediate joy." And in his philosophy of education he naturally emphasized experimental activity and living in the present, which is "holy ground." Yet to White- head, "we learn by doing" was only half the truth. "Education," he said, "consists in the habitual vision of greatness." Vision-there you have the autlhentic Platonic note. Whitehead thought of his metaphysics as a modern Platonism: the timeless forms of which Plato wrote are real, not invented. But White- head denied them that superior, self-sufficient reality which Plato usually gave them in contrast to changing things. The forms, though they are in tlhemselves undated, still are only so many possibilities for realization in the flux of things-possible patterns of existence and possible ways of feeling the changing world. Even the propositions of mathematics are statements about possible forms of process. In Whitehead's philosophy the temporal and the eternal are both there; neither is "illusion," but neither is sufficient unto itself. Each, to achieve full reality, needs the other. Never did philosopher so interweave these opposites. In truth, this philosophy generalizes perfectly, in the terms of the European philosophical tradi- tion, the attitude of that rarest of men-he whose feet are on the ground while his eyes are turned upward. V Whitehead's philosophizing was no mere intellectual game. In his view, every throb of existence has some value for itself, for others, and for the universe. Hence a morality founded on this metaphysics will en- join respect for others-not (as in the Kantian and other idealistic philos- 234</page><page sequence="13">THE PHILOSOPHY OF WHITEHEAD ophies) only for other men because they are men and man is unique in being more than a natural animal, but for all beings, and precisely because tlcy are all individuals in a reconceived natural world. Whitehead's philosophy generates a moral attitude toward nature, by teaching that there is nothing in the universe that is really and completely dead, mere material, with which we may do as our whims dictate. Vegetarianism and kindness to bacteria do not follow; but all destruction requires justi- fication. Whitehead hated violence. Yet he was not a pacifist, for he believed that no absolute rule is adequate to the conduct of life. Whitehead also gives us basic reasons for looking upon the problem of achievement, both individual and social, as a problem in the co-ordi- nation of living values. The human soul, like every being, is a synthesizer. Its good resides in the realization of a strength of many feelings fortifying each other as they meet in the novel unity. Its evil lies in the clash of vivid feelings denying to each other their proper expansion. Its triviality lies in the anaesthesia by which evil is avoided.... Evil is the half-way house between perfection and triviality. It is the violence of strength against strength. The problem of social life is to make possible a harmony of strong individuals. "The self-sufficing man, with his peculiar property which concerns no one else, is a concept without any validity for modern civiliza- tion. . . . It is not the practicable alternative to a slave society. The problem of social life is the problem of the co-ordination of [various grades of] activities, including the limits of such co-ordination." Hegel and Marx were wrong; the conflicts of unco-ordinated op- posites is a disaster. The conditions of synthesis, in every form of exist- ence, are aesthetic contrast rather than dialectical antagonism. High achievement requires a "zest" (one of Whitehead's favorite words) for those contrasting novelties which enrich, and preservation of all that does not inhibit that zest. Complete preservation is imppssible. Since everything, as it comes into existence, aims at a synthesis of what has been with what may be, the present alters the trend of the past, upwards or (Whitehead was with- out illusions) downwards. The approach to sheer continuation is char- acteristic of sticks and stones: "The art of persistence is to be dead." Besides, every process, individual or social, in taking on its character rejects a inultitude of other characters; in realizing its ideal, it is changing within a limited range of possibilities, and when these are exhausted -3)</page><page sequence="14">THE ANTIOCH REVIEW either staleness or transition to a new type of order, hitherto excluded, must set in. "The pure conservative is fighting against the essence of the Universe." These are sensible, fundamental reasons for emphasizing the need to evolve novel structures of social activity. But they are not an apology for revolution. Structures, like everything else in this cosmology, are interdependent; none can exist save as part of a wider structure which sustains it. The notion that you can clear the ground and start again from scratch is a fantasy of the romantic mind. Development, not revo- lution, is the thing. And development has its optimum pace, which it takes a very wise statesman to find out. Of course wars are great upsetters of it. Whitehead once remarked to me that in Englandi during the war, social changes which would come to their best fruit if accomplished over a period of fifty years, had to be accomplished in five, rocking the social structure to .its very bottom. Whitehead's sympathies were with the moderate Laborites in Eng- land, with the New Deal in America. His gradualism was not a conserva- tive's lip-service to the idea of progress. His point is rather that most of the people who are dissatisfied with the present have none of the patience which wisdom requires. But patience must go hand in han(d with courage. Whitehead, writing in I925, noted a pessimism which rose among the middle classes of the nineteenth century because of "a confusion between civilization and security. In the immediate future there will be less se- curity than in the immediate past.... But, on the whole, the great ages have been unstable ages." In particular, every new idea is a danger to the existing order. In contrast to the compulsion of what exists, the power of an idea is, in the first instance, persuasive. This is a special case, involving consciousness, of the functioning, in each pulse of existence, of "what may be." Behind it is the creative purposiveness which each pulse possesses in some degree. But, says Whitehead, any impartial survey of life on earth shows us that individual purposes tend to be anarchic. The general idea, capable of successive partial embodiments, introduces order into the persuasive ele- ment, and is the distinctively human agency in man's checkered progress. Here is a typical paragraph from Adventures of Ideas showing White- head's over-all judgment of this agency: 236</page><page sequence="15">THE PHILOSOPHY OF WHITEHEAD The history of ideas is a history of mistakes. But through all mistakes it is also the history of the gradual purification of conduct. When there is progress in the development of favorable order, we find conduct protected from relapse into brutality by the increased agency of ideas consciously entertained. In this way Plato is justified in his saying, the creation of the world-that is to say, the world of civilized order-is the victory of persuasion over force. Human experiences, however, are natural events, and their basis is emotional, not intellectual. Conscious thought, according to this philos- ophy, is a rare thing-the occasional flowering of experience, not its essence. Societies, too, are dominated by habitual modes of feeling, which are the basic facts for wise historians and statesmen. Whitehead has learned, as many thinkers have not, that man is only to a very slight degree a rational animal. But the possibility of rational guidance is there, and progress requires that it be exercised. Reason is no formal thing, but the occasional discipline, ardently to be desired, of life's ubiquitous purposiveness. Usually this discipline is confined to a pragmatic interest in the con- trol and reconstruction of some limited aspect of the environment so as to improve life in the immediate future. So do we study forestry, elec- tronics, bacteriology. This kind of intelligence begins as shrewdness in observation and manipulation, and blossoms out into John Dewey's "In- telligence in the Modern World"-an experimental method appropnrate to our l)ractical interests. The experimental sciences deserve our praise. But the history of lhuman thought, and a glance at the morning paper, both confirm White- head's judgment: The man with a method good for purposes of his dominant interests, is a pathological case in respect to his wider judgment on the co-ordination of this method with a more complete experience. Priests and scientists, statesmen and men of business, philosophers and mathematicians, are all alike in this respect.... Some of the major disasters of mankind have been produced by the narrowness of men with a good methodology. Ulysses has no use for Plato, and the bones of his companions are strewn on many a reef and many an isle. This is the justification of a wider type of reason, unlimited in its aim at generality: of the sort of thing Whitehead has done-"speculative philosophy." 237</page><page sequence="16">THE ANTIOCHI REVIE\ VI Critical appraisal of Whitehead's philosophy and its probable in- fluence is no part of my purpose in this article. It is plain that much is sure to be wrong in every product of a human brain. Perhaps-to mention but onie debatable point-Whitehead has balanced opposites too evenly, and is too close to Plato in his treatment of the idea of the eternal. He does repudiate many cherished doctrines of ancient and modern philos- ophy, especially in their negative aspects. But for all that, an(d for all the novelty of its results, his philosophy is historically a culmination of the European tradition, not the radical departure of an iconoclast. A great architect has worked some of the metaphysical ideas of Plato, and the modern emphases on "experience" and "process," into the subtlest, most spacious cosmology ever produced. It would be unfair to call this work eclectic, for its author redesigned every idea that he took over. I think that later centuries will look upon the Whiteheadian synthesis as the high-water mark of modern philosophy, comparable to the Aristotelian synthesis in the history of anicient thought. And I suspect that they will get more out of Whitehead than the nmen of this century. The philosophies of change now prevalent are thin philos- ophies turgidly expressed. When we clarify our meanings, we ten(d to restrict them rather than to enlarge them. Like Aristotle, Whitehead seems likely to be followed by men too engrossed in stabilizing their lives to care to approach his breadth of thought. Even so there is much, in addition to what I have already hiinted at, that Whitehead's philosophy can do for us now. In religion it suggests a great purification of our ideas, as many writers have noticed. In social philosophy it can make us, like Whitehead himself, as consciously appre- ciative of our heritages as a man can be witllout suffering a trace of slavery to them. Whitehead asks us to realize that-as he somewhere says-a civilization in upward transition walks close to the borderline of chaos. And he nerves us to face this future by giving us an outlook which combines good sense and imaginative courage in their maximum com- patible proportions. He also turns our thoughts toward the universe, which is well: man may not last much longer. The greatest obstacle to the spread of Whitehead's philosophy is a positivistic philosophy of science. Thumping hard on the nearest labora- tory table, the positivist condemns "the effort after the general character- 238</page><page sequence="17">THE PHILOSOPHY OF WHITEHEAD ization of the world around us" as mere "romance"; he defines knowledge as science, and science as simply an accurate report and correlation of sense-observations: that is our only knowledge, our only "reliable in- formation." To Whitehead (who was not born yesterday) this notion of an accurate report, undefiled by any explanatory interpretation, was a sophisticated form of dogmatism. If it could be consistently held, it would be an antiscientific philosophy, for the importance of science does not lie in an orderly narrative of the sense-data thus far perceived by scientists. This worship of reliable information is the trivialization of science, the death of intellectual adventure. Why is there so much hostility and indifFerence towyard systematic philosophy? One reason is that practically all philosophers presented their schemes of thought as closed systems, and claimed to arrive in principle at a complete understanding of the world. These claims have been shown up, and so systematic philosophy has received a bad name:. we condemn the arrogance of philosophers, with their neat, closed little systems, each sure of his truth and of the error of other philosophers. Then to their dogma we oppose our pragma. This was William James's main line. Jacques Barzun and many others speak it today: we should look toward the future, not back to fixed principles. Certainly, but unless we try to think out an interrelation of ideas, a perspective, our gazc will be blind and our lives confused. We ought, rather, to think of each great philosopher as offering some perspective which we can use to make a closer approach toward complete understanding. Alfred North Whitehead looked upon all that he had written as a set of suggestions only. Their criticism and qualification must be the next step. As he said, "We must have systems, but we must keep our systems open." That was the final word in the philosophy of the wisest man of our period. 239</page></plain_text>
