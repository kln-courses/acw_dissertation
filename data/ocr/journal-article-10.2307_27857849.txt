Lee Dugatkin. 208 pp. Free Press, 1999. $25. What do humans have to learn from animals about morali ty? Not much, it would seem, if, like biologist Lee Dugatkin, one believes moral sensibility to be uniquely human. But in Cheating Mon keys and Citizen Bees, Dugatkin argues that the social behavior of even the lowest animals may teach us about fostering cooperation and moral be havior among humans. The strength of Dugatkin's book lies in his plain-language explanations of sometimes difficult concepts from evo lutionary biology. Moreover, his hope that studying animal behavior may ul timately serve to promote human co operation imbues his most disquieting subject matter, such as selfish-gene the ory, with humanistic relevance. Com bined with his tempered use of anec dote and anthropomorphism, this may appeal to readers uneasy with applica tions of evolutionary thinking to hu man behavior. Dugatkin discusses four mechanisms by which natural selection drives coop Valerie M. Chase is a researcher at the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, where she studies rationality in human inference. eration: family dynamics, reciprocal transactions, selfish teamwork and group altruism. In explaining altruism among genetic relatives, he lucidly summarizes kin selection theory and Hamilton's rule, according to which an animal's willingness to compromise its fitness to help another increases with its degree of genetic relatedness to the ben eficiary. A clear example can be found in female workers of haplodiploid bee species that forego their reproduction in favor of the queen's; because of their unusual genetics, these workers are more closely related to the queen's daughters than to their own. The chapter on reciprocal interaction opens with a whirlwind introduction to evolutionary psychology, specifically the theory that humans have evolved a specialized ability to detect cheaters in social exchange. Dugatkin illustrates the conundrum of reciprocity using the Prisoner's Dilemma, in which each of two captured conspirators can either cheat (squeal on their partners) or co operate (keep silent). In this game, cheating leads to the better outcome from each suspect's standpoint, inde pendent of the other's behavior. So when will cooperation arise? The short answer is when each partner antici pates having a large, unknown num ber of future interactions with the oth er. In such repeated interactions, the best strategy turns out to be tit for tat, which mimics the partner's choice in the previous round in eye-for-an-eye</page><page sequence="2">fashion but holds no grudges beyond one round. With this theoretical foundation in place, Dugatkin provides examples of tit-for-tat-style cooperation among un related animals. For instance, impala perform reciprocal grooming, alternat ing turns frequently to discourage free loading, whereas vampire bats share blood meals only with roostmates that have previously shared with them. Sometimes reciprocal altruism occurs on a time scale so short that the exchange is essentially instantaneous. Such by-prod uct mutualism usually arises in chal lenging environments. For example, li ons typically hunt cooperatively for large prey but alone for small fry. These clear accounts of the logic be hind animal interaction contrast with Dugatkin's sometimes exasperatingly aimless musings on human morality. For instance, his discussion of Pascal's wager about leading a Christian life and such nonquestions as the "reason for people like the late Mother Teresa" are among several points at which the book loses focus. Perhaps this is Dugatkin vying for popular appeal, but he is better off sticking to biology. The fourth path to cooperation is group selection. Group selection theory attempts to explain animals' sometimes astonishing readiness to imperil them selves in ways that benefit their group. Dugatkin wisely avoids the contentious issues this theory raises and instead fo cuses on compelling examples, includ ing one from his research on predator inspection. In Trinidadian guppies, a few brave souls perform the dangerous task of approaching predators to gather information about, for instance, how hungry they are. The inspectors then share the information with noninspec tors. According to Dugatkin, such co operation can only be explained at the group level: Groups with inspectors must fare better than those without, al though individuals reduce their fitness by inspecting. Dividing the book into four parts works rhetorically, despite the fact that the various types of cooperation are ac tually entwined. Only in this chapter does one notice tension between them. Physicists believe that the best hope for a fundamental theory of nature?including unification of quantum mechanics with general relativity and elementary particle theory?lies in string theory. This elegant mathematical physics subject is expounded by Joseph Polchinski in two volumes from Cambridge University Press, String Theory: An introduction to the Bosonic String ($49.95) and String Theory: Superstring Theory and Beyond ($54.95). Written for advanced physics students and for researchers, this set provides thorough and up-to-date knowledge.

In Finding the Walls of Troy (California, $35), Susan Heuck Allen argues that Schliemann actually exploited the work of British archaeologist Frank Calvert, who excavated the site 15 years before the German archaeologist arrived. A scholarly endeavor. Turn-of-the-century neuroanatomist Santiago Ram?n y Cajal is famous not only for his contributions to science but also for his "strong personality." The latter trait comes through clearly in Advice for a Young Investigator (MIT, $22.50), a modern translation by Neely Swanson and Larry W. Swanson based on some of Cajal's writings of nearly 100 years ago. Although parts of the book are dated and naive, Cajal does have some wise words for young people considering a scientific career at the end of this century. The most delightful chapter offers Cajal's brilliant and biting characterization of various types of failed scientists. In our time Cajal might have been an editor for The National Lampoon.

Specifically, Dugatkin claims here that cooperators will always lose out to cheaters within a group, and that coop eration pays only when competition is fiercer between groups than within them, without noting that this argument seems to undermine his earlier accounts of kin selection and reciprocal altruism. In the book's weakest passages, Dugatkin attempts to reconcile his evo lutionary analysis with human morali ty. He worries that popularizations of sociobiology engender the "mistaken impression that feelings like sympathy [and] guilt... are really just natural se lection manifesting itself and should cir cumstances change, natural selection may simply favor the converse emotions" (au thor's emphasis), an "unacceptable" possibility for people (evidently in cluding himself) who believe in "ab solute right and wrong." Although this conclusion may indeed be unaccept able, even mistaken, the book provides no basis for rejecting it. Dugatkin periodically suggests ways in which the four primeval paths to cooperation could be transformed into tools for social engineering. Al though he emphasizes the preliminary nature of his proposals and hastens to identify their pitfalls, many of them (for instance, to encourage cooperative behavior in neighborhoods via kin se lection by offering financial incentives for people to settle near family mem bers) come off as clumsy and naive. The types of cooperation we see in nature ultimately stem from competi tion, whether among genes, individu als, families or groups. Animals help some conspecifics as opposed to oth ers, which paves the way for all kinds of socially undesirable competition. Acknowledging this nasty side effect in a passage on highly cooperative, in sular human groups, Dugatkin won ders if it could be avoided by encour aging individuals to belong to multiple, overlapping groups, thus keeping them from identifying too much with any single one. This seems a faint hope for a book that sets out to help us structure our social world for the better. It is an ad mittedly tall order, but the result is still disappointing given that this ambition most clearly distinguishes the book from those on similar topics recently published, such as Matt Ridley's liter ary Origins of Virtue and Elliott Sober and David Sloan Wilson's scholarly Unto Others. Nevertheless, Cheating Monkeys and Citizen Bees provides a particularly ac cessible introduction to evolutionary biological thinking and animal social behavior and at least has the gumption to point out a largely untapped animal model for improving human life.
