<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophy and Phenomenological Research Vol. Lm, No. 4, December 1993 Representation and Style* JAMES D. CARNEY Arizona State University The discussion in this paper focuses on the relative merits, if any, of a style- relative resemblance account of representation in visual art. On issues as complex and subtle as this, it is hard to come up with decisive arguments. What I will try to show is that a style-relative resemblance account of rep- resentation is a viable option.' To talk about representation in visual artworks can be to talk about what a picture denotes, symbolizes, stands for, or picks out-for example, aspects of a Dutch still-life painting are typically regarded as symbolic of moral values, and Robert Henri's 1916 Gertrude Vanderbilt in some sense denotes Gertrude Vanderbilt. Also, to talk about representation in visual art can be to talk about what the picture pictures or depicts-for example, Egon Schiele's 1917 The Embrace depicts the contorted clutching of a nude woman and man among crumpled sheets, and Henri's painting depicts a reclining I would like to thank Robert Stecker, Stephanie Ross, and Crispin Sartwell, who read and provided generous and helpful comments _on an earlier draft of this paper. I am in great debt to Stephen Davies who not only provided acute comments but in a major way helped me in clarifying the issues. I have attempted to acknowledge their particular contributions in the text or in footnotes. Finally, I wish to thank the referees of this journal for sub- stantial, creative help in a number of critical places. The general idea of an account of representation where a pivotal condition for representa- tion in visual art is that there be a resemblance between a person's perceptual experiences of W and x, given that the person views x in terms of the applicable conventions is found and argued for in Stephen Davies' unpublished manuscript on philosophy of music. Though some of the general ideas there and in my account are similar, there is a great deal of differ- ence in the detail. Davies attempts to give a complete semantic theory where convention- relative resemblances is only one of a set of necessary conditions. Less similar are a group of papers that have proposed that a relative-resemblance is a condition for pictorial representation. See, for example, Karen Neander, "Representation: A Matter of Resemblance," The British Journal of Aesthetics 27 (Summer 1987): 213- 26; David Novitz, "Picturing," The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 24 (Winter 1975): 145-55; and James W. Manns, "Representation, Relativism and Resemblance," The British Journal of Aesthetics 11 (1971): 281-87. Neander in her paper claims that inter- preting pictures is mostly a process of taking into account the mode of representation, and relative to this, recognizing likenesses between picture and subject (p. 213). But she seems to not favor style as explaining "modes" since she remarks that styles are chronically vague, amorphous groupings (p. 217). REPRESENTATION AND STYLE 811</page><page sequence="2">woman bejeweled and smartly clothed in a stylish silk lounging suit. The style-relative view of representation presented in this paper is an account of the latter. The question the view tries to answer is: What is the relationship between the descriptive features of a visual artwork and the artwork's pic- turing or depicting something? My proposal is that representational fea- tures of a visual artwork depend not merely on how a picture looks or what the artist intends to represent, but upon our perception of it as historically related to other artworks. Specifically, for a visual artwork W to represent x, there needs to be a style-generated resemblance between a spectator's per- ceptual experience of W and x.2 Familiar rival views such as those of Nelson Goodman, Richard Wollheim and Kendall Walton each seem to reject resemblance as a paramount condition for depiction.3 1. Five conditions for an adequate account of representation. Any account of representation in visual artworks should provide an explana- tion for the following: First, we look to a theory of pictorial representation to provide an expla- nation for the different ways that pictures can represent. Ernst Gombrich calls this problem the "riddle of style."4 We expect a theory to explain how representation occurs, ranging from the one extreme of Trompe l'oeil paintings-for example (a), below-to the other extreme of abstract repre- sentation-for example (f). We expect a theory to explain how representa- tion occurs in the following: (a) William Harnett's 1888 Mr. Huling's Rack Picture, which represents a taped cloth frame attached to a wooden wall holding letters, bills, and newspaper clippings; (b) Li Cheng's 10th century Temple in the mountain after rain, which represents a dream-like world with fantastic hills and crags emerging from the mist; (c) Albert Bierstadt's 1868 Among the Sierra Nevada Mountains, which represents a grand mountain landscape, a perfect type of the American idea at the time of what the heart of the Sierra Nevada should look like; (d) Fauvist landscape London Bridge, painted in 1.906 by Andre Derain, which represents a familiar scene looking from the shore of the Thames-a bridge with boats going un- der it and with London in the background-and in which arbitrary, sensuous colors seem to have an independent existence; (e) the 14th century Russian icon painting The Archangel Michael, representing a sacred figure in a tran- 2 My principle claim is initially intended to be understood as a semantic claim about the crucial necessary conditions for representation in visual art. If this proves hopeless, then I would take it as an epistemic and psychological claim that is central to whatever the ade- quate semantics turn out to be. 3 Nelson Goodman, Languages of Art (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968), Richard Woll- heim, Painting as an Art (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987), Kendall Walton, Mimesis as Make-Believe (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1990). 4 Ernst Gombrich, Art and Illusion, Second edition (New York: Pantheon Books, 1961), p. 3. 812 JAMES D. CARNEY</page><page sequence="3">scendental world; (f) Robert Diebenkorn's 1972 Ocean Park #54, represent- ing the Pacific ocean and the flat openness of Southern California with its hazy light. Second, a theory of pictorial representation needs to explain how some form of selectivity is common to pictorial representation. For example, in (d) we do not take the colors of the Fauvist landscape to be descriptive of London, though they are not just randomly related to the subject, as are the cracks in an Albert Pinkham Ryder oil painting. As another example, we do not take the variation in brush-strokes in a Suprematist painting as having any depictive significance. Third, a theory of pictorial representation needs to explain how represen- tation-i.e., picturing or depiction-can occur in abstract art. How, for ex- ample, can Diebenkorn's Ocean Park #54 depict aspects of Southern Califor- nia? Fourth, a theory needs to explain how it is possible for two different vi- sual artworks to be visually indistinguishable on a lower level-merely how they look-and yet have different representational features.5 Fifth, representation in visual art requires that a visual experience of some sort be at the core of representing. A condition for a visual artwork W representing x is that there be some connection or other between a person's visual experience of W and his or her visual experience of x. 2. Style-constrained resemblance. When a picture represents a subject, there is, on the view I am proposing, a resemblance between a spectator's perceptual experience of the artwork W and the subject. The resemblance is a visual one, and it is centrally deter- mined by the style the viewer supposes for the work. The style forces the spectator to give prominence to certain visual features of the work over oth- ers. Knowledge of the style of the painting provides the clues, often sufficient, as to how to look at the painting. What one sees in the painting, with reference to the appropriate style, resembles the depicted subject. Visual artworks typically show distinctive or characteristic features which indicate that they are the product of a particular historical time and place. In other places I consider the notion of style and how styles of art- works are discovered.6 The style of an artwork consists of characteristic 5 Arthur Danto in The Transfiguration of the Commonplace (Cambridge: Harvard Univer- sity Press, 1981), presents the problem of indiscernible counterparts: every artwork has an actual or possible IC that is a different artwork; and every artwork has an IC that is a non- artwork. I take this as a genuine problem, though I do not follow Danto in thinking it leads to supposing that artworks are not identical with "mere things." 6 "Individual Style," The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 49 (Winter 1991): pp. 15-22. In this paper the claim is that individual style is a set of characteristics of art- works and not constitutive of the artist's psychological states. "Style Theory of Art," Pacific Philosophical Quarterly 72 (December 1991): 272-89. In this paper I claim that REPRESENTATION AND STYLE 813</page><page sequence="4">features of content and form that result from a series of choices made by the artist within some set of socially embedded practices.7 For example: a char- acteristic (style) feature of Fauvism is the use of colors for expressive pur- poses; a characteristic (style) feature of Futurism is "simultaneity," a way of putting together visually in a painting sound, light and movement that happen at different times; and a characteristic (style) feature of 13th century Siennese art is to represent, in a single picture, events that take place at dif- ferent times and places. Different styles can be used to depict similar sub- jects, for example, couples in Albrecht Durer's Adam and Eve and in Grant Wood's American Gothic. The same style can be used in works that have dif- ferent specific content, for example, Futurism has been used to represent the gaiety of a dancing crowd and also the dynamism of a city rising into the fu- ture. The distinction can also be micde between the general style, Futurism, and Gino Severini's particular version of Futurism. I take art history to be a discipline within which there are substantial em- pirical constraints to determine styles such as Fauvism (general style) and Matisse's Fauvism (individual style). The normative principles of the disci- pline, together with a hard-core empirical base, prevent style classifications' being chronically vague, amorphous groupings, as some have claimed.8 Among the constraints in determining style features of artworks are the de- scriptive features of artworks, the relation of the artworks to previous art- works, the aims and goals of the artist, how the art was received, and the re- lation of the art to the culture and history of the time. In weighing and bal- ancing these considerations in positing style, one need not take the aims and for a now-object to be an artwork and not something else there needs to be some thread of continuity that ties this object to past artworks. I defend the view that the tie is a certain continuity of style. "Style and Formal Features," The Southern Journal of Philosophy, 29 (Winter 1991): 431-44. In this paper I claim that exemplified or formal features of a vi- sual artwork are style constrained descriptive features, a claim that I am extending to rep- resentational features in this paper. I also try to account for how style can explain Danto's indiscernible counterparts with examples that are not merely thought experiments. There are in the history of art examples that are or come close to indiscernible counterparts (for example, Malevich's Black Square and Reinhardt's Number 33, an example I use in the pa- per, suggesting that supposing a Suprematist style for the former and a Minimalist style for the latter yields different aesthetic features). One can explain why Fountain is an art- work and the other thousands of urinals produced by the Mott Works are not, in that the former has a causal history that results in its exhibiting an art style (Readymades). 7 My definition of style is similar to Nelson Goodman's. He writes that "style consists of those features of the symbolic functioning of a work that are characteristic of author, pe- riod, place, or school." "Style and Signature," Ways of Worldmaking (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1984), p. 35. Both accounts take style as cutting across the form/content distinction. However, I am disinclined to take representational features as denoting symbols. 8 Neander, "Pictorial Representation," p. 217. On my account of style there are no invariant styles; and values and what the historian regards as significant about art are an inseparable part of doing art history. I do not regard this as showing that art historical style classifications are murky, amorphous groupings. 814 JAMES D. CARNEY</page><page sequence="5">goals of the artist as paramount. As I argue in other places (see footnote 6), the artist's actual intention is just one of the determinants for style, with other factors having no less weight. The model for art-making suggested here is this: An artist makes choices within some set of style constraints. An artist produces a painted canvas with various descriptive features. There are style constraints that guide and limit which descriptive features the artist puts on the paper or canvas.9 Gen- erally these are the style constraints in terms of which these descriptive fea- tures are understood and interpreted by both the artist and the spectator. Understanding a descriptive feature relative to a style constraint gives rise to aesthetic features such as representational and expressive features. A style can be regarded as a weak set of quasi-social conventions.10 For a gen- eral style there might be: To represent x you ought to do y. Think of Cu- bism, Fauvism, Suprematism, Trompe l'oeil and the different social prac- tices for representing things. Finally, an art style, like language and other ways to represent, can have a life of its own, with the result that there can be a divergence between what the artist intends to represent and what is repre- sented. 3. Seeing-in. Representation in visual art requires that a visual experience of some sort be at the core of representing (condition five above). For artwork W to repre- sent x, there needs to be some connection or other between a person's visual experience of W and x. On my approach this is explained in terms of a style- generated resemblance between a spectator's perceptual experience of W and x. This experience, I claim, is seeing-in. Seeing-in is a familiar everyday expe- rience and is central to Richard Wollheim's account of representation. Fol- lowing Wollheim, I favor seeing-in as being the kind of visual experience that occurs when someone sees a picture of so-and-so. It is the visual experi- ence at the core of representing. However, unlike Wollheim, I explain this experience in a way that relies on resemblance. It seems to me that the way to understand everyday seeing-in experiences is in terms of recognition and resemblance. Seeing such things as castles in clouds and faces in rock formations, is explainable in terms of resemblance and a spectator's ability (usually non-propositional, like that of cats and birds) to recognize castles and human faces. Consider, for example, the rock formation "Sleeping Camel," along highway 66 in Colorado. The easy and 9 This model for artistic creation is compatible with new and revolutionary styles. A promising account of how this works is found in Leonard B. Meyer, "Toward a Theory of Style," Berel Lang (ed.), The Concept of Style (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1987). 10 See Margaret Gilbert's "Notes on the Concept of a Social Convention," New Literary History 14 (1982-83): 225-51 for an account of social convention which I believe is suit- able for style conventions. REPRESENTATION AND STYLE 815</page><page sequence="6">familiar way to explain travelers' experiences of seeing a sleeping camel in this rock formation is seeing something-rocks-which resemble a sleeping camel. A traveler's ability to see a resemblance between the rocks and a sleeping camel is explained in terms of the traveler's ability to recognize camels, specifically camels when they sleep. The spectator-sees a resemblance between x and y, where the standard for resemblance is that a sufficient number of the features relied on to recognize y's occur in x. People (and an- imals) rely on some form of prototypes of the most typical instances of things such as camels. Recognizing a resemblance between x and y depends on a sufficient number of the features of the spectator's prototype for y be- ing features of x. Wollheim believes that seeing-in is innate. This seems to me to be proba- bly right. In addition I believe that there is such a thing as natural resem- blance, which also may be innate, and that seeing-in on an early level is only explainable by natural resemblance." W. V. Quine argues that a standard of resemblance or similarity is in some sense innate.12 Without some genetic disposition to see similarities, animals and people would react to all stimuli in the same way, and it is difficult to see how any learning could take place. Seeing-in on some basic level relies on natural resemblance, and the ev- eryday experience of seeing objects in things is dependent, ultimately, on this. But there are everyday cases of seeing-in which go beyond natural ten- dencies to see resemblances. These are the result of social or conceptual pro- cessing of stimuli. When we get to visual art, whatever natural tendencies there may be are incorporated and structured in various ways by style con- ventions. 4. Style-generated resemblance and the five conditions. For artwork W to represent x, on my view, there needs to be a resemblance between a person's perceptual experience of W and x, granted that the person views W relative to the appropriate style. This experience is seeing-in, if it is understood in the way outlined above, where what a spectator sees in a pic- ture depends wholly or in part on how the spectator looks at it relative to the appropriate style. A consequence of some importance is that seeing-in cannot be used to distinguish non-abstract art, such as (a)-(e), from abstract art when it represents. In each case there is a resemblance between a person's Stephen Davies argues for natural resemblance as a causal precondition for resemblance and shows the damaging consequences that this has for the semiotic view of Nelson Goodman. It was correspondence with Davies and conversations with my colleague J. Richard Creath that made me fully appreciate the importance of natural resemblance for a resemblance account of representation in visual art. 12 W. V. Quine, "Natural Kinds," Ontological Relativity and Other Essays (New York: Columbia University Press, 1969), pp. 123-26. 816 JAMESD. CARNEY</page><page sequence="7">perceptual experience of W and x, granted that the person views W relative to the appropriate style. Painting (a) exhibits a Trompe l'oeil style. The aim of this style and its many related styles such as Photorealism is to provide for the spectator a vi- sual experience similar to what the spectator would have if he or she per- ceived the subject. The configuration of shared features in this case is that the picture have or come close to having the features responsible for a visual ex- perience which one could have of a frame holding the collection of objects, the model for the picture. The seeing-in experience is maximal at the two ends. The style-forced attention brings about salience for the total visual ex- perience. The visual experience resembles the subject in a maximal way in that the painting relative to the style provides the spectator with a visual experience very similar to some experience the spectator could naturally have in seeing the subject. It is not merely the descriptive features that ex- plain the seeing-in experience, since in a different historical context an indis- cernible counterpart could exhibit a style that results in a knowledged spec- tator having a distinctively different seeing-in experience. Consider the other extreme, the abstract representation, (f). Diebenko- rn's style directs the spectator to the formal order, the horizontal lines and bands, with areas of varying color and with no familiar subject matter. Wollheim correctly emphasizes that visual experience of a knowledged spectator involves discerning lines, colored areas standing out and receding. But more than this is involved in abstract representation. The style, along with what the artist puts on the canvas, forces on the spectator a visual ex- perience that resembles the subject. A knowledged spectator can see a configuration that resembles aspects of Southern California in the same way that a knowledged spectator can see the dynamic jazz movement in a street- grid of Manhattan in Mondrian's 1942 Broadway Boogie-Woogie. Claims about resemblance are always context-sensitive. In art, resem- blance is relative to the style appropriate for the art. The style supplies the standard for resemblance. There are various and potentially limitless stan- dards for resemblance in art. For much art &lt;similar in appearance&gt; is the standard, where Trompe l'oeil art is a kind of limiting case, and where the similarity in appearance holds for about everything a spectator sees. As one moves from this style to other styles, selectivity occurs, and only some of what is seen is taken as similar. Also to various degrees non-abstract pic- tures are causally and historically related to natural resemblance. In ab- stract representational art, similarity in natural appearance is replaced with similarity in nature, broadly conceived. Primarily, in this type of art, the artist converts forms observed in reality or in imagination into patterns which are interpreted with reference to the original source, a kind of re- versed conversion. Here also selectivity occurs, where style, titles, and so on signal what is taken as similar. REPRESENTATION AND STYLE 817</page><page sequence="8">Nothing, however-and this is true of visual artworks-is intrinsically representational. So for each of all the various types of paintings there can be an indiscernible counterpart, a visually indistinguishable artwork that does not represent or that represents a different subject. I believe such indis- cernible counterparts are best explained in terms of pairs exhibiting differ- ent styles. (See footnote 6.) Thus, for example, for (b) to represent a dream- like world emerging from the mist, rather than a futuristic cityscape or even an abstract structure, requires a certain causal history for (b) that results in (b) exhibiting a style which promotes seeing a dream-like world in (b). Representation as necessarily style-generated resemblance can explain se- lectivity in pictorial representation. In a landscape such as Derain's we do not regard the colors to be imitative or descriptive of what is represented- i.e. to be the colors of the bridge, barges, and the portion of the Thames river represented in the picture. Is this explainable in terms of the spectator's knowledge that the bridges and barges in London in 1905 did not have such colors? Not entirely. The picture could represent an imaginary or fictitious London bridge scene where the depicted objects have the colors (and even the shapes). To explain why the colors are not taken as imitative requires an ap- peal at some point to the style the artist was working in. (d) is painted in a Fauvist style. The Fauvists characteristically applied color arbitrarily and used extreme distortions of the shapes of recognizable objects for expres- sive purposes. So we do not regard the colors and shapes as resembling fea- tures. In contrast the style of the Bierstadt painting signals that the colors are imitative and taken as the colors of trees, mountains, snow, sky, and so on. A characteristic feature of much of German Expressionism and an indi- vidual style feature found in the paintings of Max Beckmann is the tech- nique of outlining figures for expressive purposes. Beckmann's 1918 Night depicts a couple being tortured. They are depicted as figures clamped in heavy black outlines. People do not have black outlines. Black outlines, along with childlike simplification of design and figures occupying compressed space, are features of his style to achieve the expression of intentional content made up of an attitude toward experience characterized by such things as tortured longing, ecstasies, and dark and deep fears (the cultivated social consciousness in pre-war Germany). Often, even in the case of familiar, habitual styles, accessibility is to some degree limited. For example, the works of Hudson River painters such as Bierstadt are sometimes taken by casual museum goers as art that is accu- rate to some actual subject matter. To the surprise of some, Hudson River art is not art that is accurate, historical, or realistic in the sense of being truthful to actual objects in the world. A style feature of artists such as Church and Bierstadt is composite painting, where elements are taken from studies, photographs, the imagination and even other paintings. The result was landscape paintings that depicted things which did not exist, and which 818 JAMESD. CARNEY</page><page sequence="9">in fact could hardly exist. They are depictions of the American idea of what our scenery ought to be, an ideal, metaphoric America, where a religious or sublime experience is possible (in this aspect the art thus functions like re- ligious Russian icons).13 Up to this point, style-generated resemblance is presented as a pivotal condition, a necessary condition, for representation. Is it ever sufficient? Of- ten it is. Often what the knowledged spectator sees in the picture is what it represents. Often it is not. In some cases the direct relation of artist's inten- tions and other historical conditions are relevant, and often in abstract art or art that tends towards abstraction, the title is required for a spectator to see in the picture what is actually represented. Titles as much as styles are fre- quently relied on in the first place to see anything, beyond low level seeing, in visual art. For example, without the title of Severini's 1910 "Pam-Pam at the Monico" it would normally be beyond a spectator's ability to see in the picture a dancing crowd. Without the title to Mondrian's 1942 "Broadway Boogie-Woogie" most spectators would likely see the painting as abstract and non-representational, and they would be unable to see jazz structure im- posed on the dizzy street grid of Manhattan. However, in those many cases where perceiving a picture in its correct style is sufficient to see what is rep- resented, the resemblance is not symmetrical and reflexive but is a three- place, style-relative relation. Thus if W bears a style-relativized resem- blance to x, it does not imply that x bears that relation to W; x needs to ex- hibit the style. Thus a resemblance condition for representation need not conflict with Goodman's observation that representation is an asymmetric relation, and hence not reducible to two-place resemblance. In concluding this section it would be well to reiterate that style-gener- ated resemblance is presented as a central condition for picturing or depict- ing and not as a condition for denoting, standing for, picking out, or symbol- izing. Symbolizing frequently occurs in visual art and, when it does, it is part of a successful interpretation of an artwork. The Chinese landscape (b) has features that are symbolic of moral values. Certain rules and criteria dic- tated the form and use of icons such as (e). For example, gold leaf gilding symbolizes divine radiance. Also characteristic of the Hudson River artists is a hidden iconology in their landscape paintings which has been virtually ignored by modern art historians.14 Nature is spiritualized through the use of anthropomorphic, symbolic personifications associated with faces and figures in rocks and mountains, where, for example, a face is taken as a sym- bol of God's presence. 13 See Nancy K. Anderson and Linda S. Ferber, Albert Bierstadt: Art &amp; Enterprise (New York: Hudson Hills Press, 1990). 14 See J. Gray Sweeney, "The Nude of Landscape Painting," Smithsonian Studies in American Art 3 (Fall 1989): 43-65. REPRESENTATION AND STYLE 819</page><page sequence="10">5. Wollheim's seeing-in and Walton's make-believe. I now wish to bring into sharper focus the account of pictorial representa- tion that I have been urging by contrasting it with its principal competitors. They are Kendall Walton's make-believe view and Richard Wollheim's see- ing-in account. My principle worry with Walton's and Wollheim's accounts of repre- sentation is that each account fails to adequately explain representation when it occurs in art styles such as Trompe l'oeil and related styles, and when representation occurs in abstract art. (I also believe that their accounts do not adequately explain the plasticity of vision, but I will not take this up here.15) I trace the cause of their incomplete accounts, if indeed their accounts are incomplete, to not using resemblance as the central condition governing representation. "What all representations have in common," Kendall Walton says in his recent book, "is a role in make-believe."16 Walton's theory of representation as it applies to visual artworks is only as good as the resemblance between seeing things in pictures and indulging in make-believe games with visual props. Walton is commonly interpreted as providing a theory of representa- tion in visual art that is an alternative to and contrary to theories that try to explain pictorial representation in terms of denotation, resemblance, or see- ing-in. Representations in visual art are, on his account, objects whose func- tion or purpose in a given social group is to serve as props in games of make- believe. "A person looking at a ship-painting is to imagine a ship if she wants to appreciate the painting in the (socially determined) appropriate manner."17 If a spectator sticks to the socially determined game of make-be- lieve, then the spectator has access to what a picture represents. The games of make-believe we play with visual artworks are not occasioned by any ex- plicit proposals like "let this mud glob be a mud pie." Walton says that most principles of generation in visual artworks "are never explicitly agreed on or even formulated, and imaginers may be unaware of them, at least in the sense of being unable to spell them out."'8 15 Stephanie Ross in an unpublished paper, "Representation and the Plasticity of Vision," suggests that a condition for correctness is that any adequate theory needs to explain the plasticity of vision. This is a spectator's ability to see one thing in terms of many other things. I believe that style-generated resemblance explains this phenomenon. There can be a resemblance between a spectator's perceptual experience of W and x relative to S1 and a resemblance between a spectator's perceptual experience of W and y relative to S2. In her paper she argues that the plasticity of vision is not adequately explained by either Woll- heim's seeing-in or Walton's make-believe. 16 Walton, Mimesis as Make-Believe, p. 4. 17 Walton, "Reply to Reviewers," Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 51 (June 1991): 430. Wollheim's "A Note on Mimesis as Make-Believe" is also found in this issue. 18 Walton, Mimesis as Make-Believe, p. 38. 820 JAMES D. CARNEY</page><page sequence="11">Walton explains representation in visual art in terms of participation in visual games of make-believe. This participation involves an experience that is foundational for representation: the experience of seeing something-the marks on the canvas-and imagining something, where the seeing and the imagining are "integrated into a single complex phenomenological whole."'9 Imagining is central to Walton's theory. As I understand Walton, make-believe is explained, or explained in part, in terms of imagination.20 When a spectator recognizes mountains in Bierstadt's painting, the spectator sees the marks on the canvas and imagines seeing mountains as part of the experience of participating in a visual game of make-believe. The picture ac- tually represents mountains, is a mountain-picture, when the imagination is socially appropriate. For many of us it is elusive and unfamiliar to understand the experience of seeing mountains in Bierstadt's painting as imagining seeing mountains, where the globs of paint function as props in a game of make-believe-the person imagining of his or her seeing the marks on the canvas, that it is seeing mountains. I agree with Wollheim that a more tangible and familiar way to understand such experiences is in terms of seeing-in.2' Wollheim also apparently rejects resemblance as a necessary condition for depiction, and thus what may make up part of the explanation for seeing- in. The answer that Wollheim gives to how paintings come to represent what they do is: "a picture represents that which it has the power to cause a suitably sensitive, suitably informed spectator to see in its surface and which the artist marked the surface so that the spectator should see in it."22 If a spectator sees a subject in a picture and the artist marked the picture so that spectators should see this, then the picture represents the subject. See- ing-in exists prior to representation in art, and the practice of producing pic- tures depends on, is a carry-over of the commonplace seeing-in experiences. "From seeing figures in stained walls there is a smooth transition to seeing a water-mill in Hobbema's canvas [1670, The Water Mill with the Great Red Roof]."23 I have attempted an explanation of the experience of seeing-in that makes use of resemblance. Wollheim is explicit about not providing any analysis. He intends the notion of seeing-in as it enters his theory to be unanalyzed. 19 Walton, Mimesis as Make-Believe, p. 295. 20 This is also how William Charlton interprets Walton in his review of Mimesis as Make- Believe in The British Journal of Aesthetics 31 (October 1991): 369-70. 21 Richard Wollheim, Art and Its Objects, Second Edition (Cambridge: Cambridge Univer- sity Press, 1989), supplementary essay V, and Painting as an Art. 22 Wollheim, "A Note on Mimesis as Make-Believe, " p. 403. The idea that a spectator needs to take style into account in recognizing what a picture represents may be, and I hope is implied by Wollheim's insistence that the spectator be "a suitably sensitive, suitably in - formed spectator." 23 Wollheim, "A Note on Mimesis as Make-Believe," p. 405. REPRESENTATION AND STYLE 821</page><page sequence="12">He thinks that an explanation of seeing-in is unnecessary since it is such a familiar experience, and it is sufficient for his purposes to just gesture to- ward it. Wollheim seems to see his account of representation as contrary to Wal- ton's.24 But it is not clear that Walton wants to give a theory contrary to Wollheim's. Recently he has tried to reconcile and fuse the two views in the following way. Walton correctly notes that Wollheim provides no analysis or explanation for seeing-in. Walton, consequently, finds Wollheim's the- ory to be incomplete. But, Walton asks, if he were to give an explanation, what would it look like? Given the unavailability of resemblance to com- plete the account, Walton reasons that "the experiences of seeing-in are ex- periences of participation in visual games of make-believe."25 Walton's primary reason for this is as follows: Seeing-in for Wollheim, in connection with Among the Sierra Nevada Mountains, say, consists of an experience with two distinct aspects to it: perceiving a surface, and in this surface see- ing mountains. "For when (say) I see a face in a picture.. .I recognize a face: on the other hand, I am visually aware of the surface of the picture."26 Walton asks in what sense does a spectator recognize or identify mountains? One does not literally do so, since in such a context there are no actual mountains to recognize. "We do not see what is represented in the represen- tation."27 There is, Walton says, no "viable option [for Wollheim] for ex- plaining the recognitional aspect of seeing-in without turning to the imagi- nation. The spectator imagines seeing and recognizing [mountains], as part of the perceptual/imaginative experience of participating in a visual game of make-believe."28 There appears to be no viable option other than appeal to imagining for Wollheim, because he (like Walton) forgoes any illusion view, information view, semiotic view, and, in particular, any resemblance account of seeing- in-any account of seeing mountains in Bierstadt's painting that relates what is seen to be mountains, in particular a resemblance between a person's visual experience of the painting and mountains. If so, the consequence is that Wollheim and Walton's views merge at this point. The experiences of seeing-in and make-believe are explained in terms of an experience with two aspects: seeing a surface and imagining, where the latter notion is primitive relative to both seeing-in and make-believe. "I claim that experiences of see- 24 Wollheim, "A Note on Mimesis as Make-Believe," p. 403, says that there is a "disagreement" on how paintings come to represent what they do. 25 Walton, "Reply to Reviewers," p. 423 and p. 424. Resemblance alone, as Walton empha- sizes, is not sufficient to explain seeing-in since S can see a resemblance between W and y without seeing y in W. What else is needed? Spectator's prototypes and style-enhanced prototypes can be the additional element to explain seeing y in W. 26 Wollheim, Painting as an Art, p. 101. 27 Walton, Mimesis as Make-Believe, p. 311. 28 Walton, "Reply to Reviewers," p. 425. 822 JAMES D. CARNEY</page><page sequence="13">ing-in are experiences of participation in visual games of make-believe."29 Where differences remain, it would be with respect to the standard for when what is imagined is what is represented. Wollheim looks to artist's inten- tions, while Walton looks to various principles of generation (which may actually turn out to be principles of style-generation). On a unified W/W theory of representation in visual art, imagination rather than resemblance is the central condition governing representation. My main worry here is that the W/W theory is underdeveloped because there are cases of representation it cannot account for, primarily, though not ex- clusively: Trompe l'oeil art and related styles, and abstract representation. Wollheim claims that Trompe l'oeil art is not representation since it does not invoke attention to the marked surface.30 On my explanation of seeing-in, nothing prevents seeing-in applying to Trompe l'oeil art. On the W/W account, imagination is required for representation. Since imagination is not involved in Trompe l'oeil art and, for that matter, related styles such as Photorealism, this provides grounds for denying that such art is represen- tational. If defenders of the W/W theory should insist that imagination does occur here, then the notion of imagination that plays the pivotal role in the theory is so diluted (now part of almost any visual experience) that it is difficult to see that any substantial theory for representation remains.31 For both Wollheim and Walton, almost every abstract painting is repre- sentational. For Wollheim we see things in paintings when we recognize the painted surface for what it is and simultaneously see past it, construing patches of paint as three-dimensional objects of some depth. On the W/W ac- count, the seeing here gets replaced with imagining. And, interestingly, both Wollheim and Walton give similar accounts of the representational content of abstract art. Wollheim writes that "it is part of the representational con- tent of Malevich's Suprematist Painting that a yellow rectangle lies over a horizontal green line."32 Walton finds that a Suprematist painting "merely depicts its own elements in a certain manner... [it] calls merely for imaginative rearrangements of the marks on its surface."33 Restricting the representational content of Suprematist art in this way imposes an impover- 29 Walton, "Reply to Reviewers," p. 424. "What is a person doing when she sees a dog in a design? She is participating in a visual game of make-believe," Mimesis as Make-Believe, p. 300. 30 "It is however worth noting that, if there are certain abstract paintings that are non-repre- sentational for the reason that they do not call for awareness of depth, there are also paintings that are non-representational for the complementary reason, or because they do not invoke, indeed they repel, attention to the marked surface. Trompe l'oeil paint- ings... are surely in this category. They incite our awareness of depth, but do so in a way de- signed to baffle our attention to the marks upon the surface." Wollheim, Painting as an Art, p. 62. 31 I owe this point to Stephen Davies who pointed it out to me in correspondence. 32 Wollheim, "A Note on Mimesis as Make-Believe," p. 402. 33 Walton, Mimesis as Make-Believe," p. 57. REPRESENTATION AND STYLE 823</page><page sequence="14">ished account of the representational content of Suprematist art. Most art historians interpret Malevich's abstract Suprematist paintings as represent- ing gravity-free objects in absolute space. Similar considerations apply to Diebenkorn's Ocean Park #54 or Mondrian's Broadway Boogie-Woogie. More happens than having our awareness of depth incited when a knowl- edged spectator sees in the painting what is represented. In addition, the W/W account of representation implies that almost all abstract art, and for that matter almost all visual art, is representational. Only if one cannot construe patches of paint as three-dimensional is a painting not representa- tional. What worries me here is the lack of resources in the W/W approach to explain the fact that Formalistic art such as Minimalist art and much Conceptual art are examples of artworks with no representational features. In sum, what the W/W approach has to say (or not say) about Trompe l'oeil art and related styles, and about abstract art which has representational fea- tures and abstract art that does not have any representational features makes it difficult to see that any substantial theory for representation is being pro- posed. 6. Some objections. The feasibility of a view that the pivotal condition for representation in vi- sual art is style-generated resemblance cannot really be tested other than by attempting to work it out in more detail. But it may be of use to attempt to reply to certain objections, which, if correct, would doom the proposal from the beginning. Objection One. The account is circular. On the account of style, style comprises certain characteristic features of both content and form. So one cannot say what style something has prior to determining or deciding whether, among other things, it represents. This objection supposes that something can be an artwork and not exhibit a style and that an artwork can have aesthetic features-in particular, repre- sentational features-without exhibiting a style. A promising way to ex- plicate the conditions for something being in the extension of 'artwork' is to make use of resemblance between art-style features where something is a work of art if it has (shares, repudiates, extends, amplifies, and so on) an artistic style.34 If this historical-externalist approach to defining art has any merit, then to be an artwork is always to exhibit an art style. An artwork can have aesthetic features without style only if such features are simply descriptive features and not in any way contextual. Finally objects can exhibit styles through the artist's acting within an art-historical frame- work even if the details of what it is are still to be determined. Because art- 34 This is the approach to defining art presented in "Style Theory of Art." 824 JAMES D. CARNEY</page><page sequence="15">making is an embedded social practice, one can be justified in assuming an ob- ject exhibits a style without any knowledge of what it is. Objection Two. Part of the argument for the view is that its primary ri- val, what I call the W/W account of representation, fails. The initial criti- cism of Walton is that his account relies on an elusive account of the experi- ence of looking at a painting in terms of make-believe. The initial criticism of Wollheim is that his theory is incomplete because he does not give an ac- count of the experience of seeing-in. If Walton's account is continuous with seeing-in, this solves both problems. The familiar experience of seeing-in gives us a grasp of what is elusive in Walton, while Walton provides the missing account of seeing-in.35 Rather than solving both problems, a unified W/W account of representa- tion is put in jeopardy if ordinary seeing-in, seeing a face in a rock formation, is best explained in terms of a resemblance between a spectator's perceptual experience of the rocks and the perceptual experience of seeing faces. One avoids the need for coming to grips with both the elusiveness of Walton's description of the experience of looking at a painting in terms of imagining, and Wollheim's unanalyzed seeing-in, if resemblance can explain seeing-in. Objection Three. It is claimed that the now unified W/W theory is incom- plete because there are cases of representation, Trompe l'oeil and abstract representation, that the theory cannot account for. Wollheim, however, mis- handles Trompe l'oeil art. As long as one is looking at such paintings and is not deceived into taking the painting for what it represents, Wollheim's see- ing-in occurs. It is only when the spectator gets carried along with the illu- sion it can generate that seeing-in does not occur. With respect to abstract representation, seeing-in plus artist's intention account for depictive repre- sentation, not any of the various sorts of symbolic representation. If the Mondrian painting can be said to represent a jazzy bird's eye view of a street grid, then the representation is not depictive, but symbolic. A spectator informed by the style of the Mondrian painting and title can have a visual experience generated by the work which is more than seeing some colored shapes before or behind other colored shapes'. An informed spectator can equally have some kind of visual experience with a Suprema- tist painting describable as seeing gravitationally free objects in absolute space. The issue here is not whether a jazzy street structure exists or whether there are objects in absolute space, since I am supposing that 'W represents x' is a one-place predicate indicating the kind of picture W is. Granted, talk about Mondrian's picture representing a dancing street-grid is part of what we take as interpreting the picture. But in defending interpreta- tions connected with pictorial depiction, one must appeal to a visual experi- ence. 35 I wish to acknowledge Robert Stecker's help in formulating this objection. REPRESENTATION AND STYLE 825</page><page sequence="16">There are no evident resources available to the W/W account to explain robust abstract representation. A consequence of the W/W account is that abstract art, unless it is symbolic of something, has no distinguishable repre- sentational subject-matter other than that connected with the formal ar- rangements of colors, shape, and depth. There is no visual experience avail- able on the theory to support the painting representing the abstract struc- ture of a dance other than symbolically. In addition, if all abstract represen- tation is explained in terms of and only in terms of W/W seeing-in, then al- most all abstract paintings are representational. Only if a painting does not "incite our awareness of depth" is it non-representational.36 Wollheim suggests that Barnett Newmann's 1950 Vir Heroicus Sublimis, a large uni- formly monochromatic painting, is, perhaps, non-representational. But there are many abstract paintings that are replete with rich formal relations that are not representational, for example, abstract paintings that exhibit Mini- malist style, such as Frank Stella's 1962 Gran Cairo and Don Judd's 1970 Untitled. These artworks do not have representational features even though they can generate almost limitless visual experiences involving the spatial relation of elements. The W/W account provides no explanation for what is going on with non-representational visual art. The W/W theory also lacks the resources to explain the dual aspects of Trompe l'oeil representation. Seeing-in, on W/W, requires that the painting "invoke" attention to the marked surface and that the painting "incite" an awareness of depth.37 Appreciating Harnett's painting can involve going along with the illusion or appreciating the painting's surface in the way that is normally done with paintings. A style feature of Trompe l'oeil is its ca- pacity to afford a dual seeing-in experience. It is possible, though unlikely, that with modern technology a form -pf Trompe l'oeil could evolve where typically the only aspect is the illusionary one. Intuitively, it seems awk- ward to regard such pictures as lacking representational features. On my ac- count of Trompe l'oeil painting, one sees what (a) represents if one has a vi- sual experience closely similar to that of seeing, for example, a board full of a variety of objects, whether or not this is connected with the marked surface or illusion. Objection Four. Resemblance is claimed as necessary for non-denoting or non-symbolic representation in visual art. But how can one exclude this kind of representation from depicting without facing a circularity problem?38 The class of non-denoting or non-symbolic representation in visual art can be tagged as just those cases where representation is a result of seeing-in. When W represents x and there is no resemblance between a spectator's per- 36 Wollheim, Painting as an Art, p. 62. 37 Wollheim, Painting as an Art, p. 62. 38 This objection was suggested by one of the referees. 826 JAMES D. CARNEY</page><page sequence="17">ceptual experience of W and x, then denoting or symbolic representation of x occurs. Turning the theory back on an intuitive distinction to get things going can be taken as a case of explicating or attempting to explicate the original intuitive distinction. Objection Five. Resemblance between an artwork and its subject can, at least sometimes, be specified independently of style.39 There are cases where a picture and its subject call into play the same recognitional capacities, re- gardless of the style the spectator supposes for the painting. That is, there are cases where we can, for example, interpret a picture successfully as a mountain picture because we can recognize mountains without any acquain- tance with the pictorial style. Indiscernible counterparts put in jeopardy the idea that, merely on the ba- sis of what one can recognize in a picture, a spectator can specify what it rep- resents. This objection rests on supposing that what Flint Schier has called Convention C is satisfactory.40 If W admits a "naturally generated" inter- pretation p, then W means p. The kind of resemblance here between W and x required for W to represent x is that, once a spectator has learned to inter- pret some member of the works in a system of representation, then that per- son can interpret the rest, given that he or she can recognize W's subject. For example, a spectator has the ability to interpret the Beirstadt painting as representing mountains because the spectator can recognize mountains, given some minimal acquaintance with the pictorial system. But why does Among the Sierra Nevada Mountains represent mountains rather than space ships? There must be more to the resemblance between the painting and the moun- tains than the mere fact that they trigger the same recognitional capacities, for the painting and mountain-shaped space ships could also trigger the same recognitional capacities. Also, what a picture represents is more than merely what a spectator recognizes in the picture. Pictures are not Rorschach tests. Wollheim and Walton are right in looking for a standard for correctness. Wollheim locates this in artist's intentions, while Walton claims that the authorized game for the paint pattern provides the standard. I have suggested that in many cases knowledge of the style of the painting, often aided by ti- tles, and what is seen in the painting relative to this are sufficient. Objection Six. Resemblance is a transparent relation. So if a picture rep- resents its subject, what is represented exists. The 14th century icon repre- sents angels in a transcendental world, but it cannot resemble them if we suppose there are no angels. 39 I owe this objection to Crispin Sartwell, who would, I believe, support it by making an appeal to his modified version of Schier's theory of natural generativity. 40 Flint Schier, Deeper into Pictures (Cambridge University Press, 1987), p. 132. REPRESENTATION AND STYLE 827</page><page sequence="18">The style-generated resemblance approach can deal with such cases coun- terfactually as suggested by Novitz and others.4' When a picture resembles a fictional subject, the similar configuration of features are those of the pic- ture and what the subject would have if it existed; This raises many thorny problems, among which are what do to with non-existing objects for which there is not a sufficient fictional appearance by which they can be identified independently of the picture, and what to do with visual absurdities such as those typically depicted in Magritte's paintings. I hold out the hope that there are plausible ways to handle these cases, such as Neander's treating re- semblance in these cases as a relation between internal imagery and the pic- ture, without giving up resemblance as a paramount condition for represen- tation.42 7. Conclusion. My proposal is that the pivotal condition for a visual artwork W represent- ing x is that there be a resemblance between a person's visual experience of W and x, given that the person views W in terms of W's appropriate style. Resemblance here is style-relativized. The visual experience is seeing-in. But I explain seeing a so-and-so in a picture as seeing features of the picture which one takes as resembling a so-and-so. The visual experience in art is see- ing-in, but it is one such that the style supposed for W constrains the experi- ence. Directionality in representing is achieved by the resemblance being asymmetrical-a relation between W, x and style. Style, like language, can achieve a life of its own. So in many cases what is represented in W is what a style-informed spectator sees in W. In many cases additional help is needed to see what is represented, and this often comes from the titles. The account, I claim, provides a plausible explanation for the five conditions for an ade- quate theory of representation and, in doing so, avoids the incompleteness of its nearest competitors. 41 The suggestion that there is a counterfactual aspect for resemblance in representation is hardly novel. For example, both Novitz in "Picturing" and Schier in Deeper into Pictures makes this suggestion. 42 Neander, "Pictorial Representation," p. 224. 828 JAMES D. CARNEY</page></plain_text>
