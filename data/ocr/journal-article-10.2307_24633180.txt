Reviewed by Garland E. Allen, Associate Professor, Department of Biology, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri 63130. In the past seventy years countless children have grown up reading, or being told, the animal stories of Ernest Thompson Seton. Books such as Wild Animals I Have Known, The Trail of the Sand Hill Stag, the Biography of a Silver Fox, and</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 363 Animal Heroes, not to mention hundreds of stories appearing in Scribner's, The American Magazine, Harpers, and Boy's Life, have introduced generations of children to the lives and habits of North American mammals and birds. But who was Seton? Probably few people know anything about this amazing man who shaped the attitudes of so many individuals, young and old, about nature and the natural world. The present biography, a reprint of a 1976 ph.d. dissertation by John Henry Wadland at York University in Toronto, goes a long way toward setting Seton in his intellectual, cultural, and historical context. More than a mere biography, Wadland's book provides a glimpse into the history of at least one aspect of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century ecological history. Well written and illustrated, it traces Seton's career from his birth in England to his family's trans plantation to Canada, and from there his own development as a naturalist, painter, writer, and finally as founder of the Woodcraft Indians and the Boy Scouts of America. When homesteading with his brother in western Canada in the early 1880s, Seton began the active practice of keeping a journal of his observations of animals and their behavior, including numerous drawings. When the rigors of homesteading proved too much, Seton undertook a serious career as an artist, particularly as a painter of animals. After study in several of the most popular and influential art salons in England and France, Seton returned to the United States where he earned money for a while as an animal and nature illustrator for many articles and books. At the same time, as a serious painter he received considerable attention, if not always praise, for his iconoclastic works. One of his most celebrated paintings, titled Awaited in Vain (1892), is a grisly scene depicting a group of wolves devouring the skeleton of a hunter who had for years tracked down members of their pack. In this painting, as in others more gently conceived (such as Sleeping Wolf in 1891), Seton tried to present the animal and its context through the animal's eyes, not our own. He strongly opposed anthropomorphism and the sentimental 'nature fakers' who wrote about animals as if they were people. Seton's paintings won him honors in both European and Canadian circles and helped to bring him into contact with such naturalists as C. Hart Merriam and Spencer Fullerton Baird of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Seton was taken on at the Smithsonian as an ornithologist, with special respon sibility for improving the museum's collection of birds of western Canada. As ambitious as he was iconoclastic, Seton wanted to be regarded among the ranks of the best naturalists of his day. In the 1890s and early 1900s he published a number of descriptive, anatomical, and taxonomic articles on birds in the Auk, culminating in a 200-page monograph, 'The Birds of Manitoba,' as a number of the Proceedings of the United States National Museum, 1891, pp. 457-643. Although attacked roundly by professional ornithologists, 'The Birds of Manitoba' con</page><page sequence="3">364 Journal of the History of Medicine : July 1982 tained much useful descriptive and biogeographic information. Stunned by his lack of success, Seton turned increasingly to both his art and to story writing. Influenced by the famous photographic studies of horses by Eadweard Muy bridge, Seton produced at this time (1897) an exhaustive and well-illustrated monograph on animal locomotion as related both to anatomy and to artistic representation. Seton culminated his career as a naturalist with the publication of a two-volume survey, Life Histories of Northern Animals (Scribner's 1909), a work that finally established Seton's name clearly and unmistakably among naturalists in the English-speaking world. From this period onward, however, Seton's interest turned increasingly toward literary and organizational activities, including his involvement with the Boy Scout movement. A common theme runs through much of Seton's work, whether it is mani fested in his paintings, his fictional stories, or his descriptive natural history. A protoecologist and ethologist (Wadland compares him to Aldo Leopold), Seton strove to present animals in their natural context. From his earliest journals as a young homesteader in Manitoba, until near the end of his life, Seton kept detailed records of his observations of animal behavior in the field. Seton felt that human beings and their industrial technology threatened the natural eco system and with it the lives of animals, large and small. An advocate of the con cept of wilderness, as opposed to that of conservation and the national parks movement, Seton was out of kilter with many of the values of the progressive era in which he flourished. He was opposed to centralization and the frontier concept. The Indian, not the western pioneer, was his hero. He despised the emphasis on preserving animals in order to hunt them; in containing nature instead of being a part of nature; in learning about nature only to exploit it. His animal stories, like his painting Awaited in Vain, saw the world from the eyes of the animal. And very often human beings came off as the villains in Seton's depiction of nature. An avid reader of works in natural history, Seton was particularly impressed with the writings of Prince Peter Kropotkin on 'mutual aid.' Opposed to the social Darwinism of Herbert Spencer and William Graham Sumner, Seton saw the dominant theme in nature to be cooperation, not competition. He thus inclined toward a socialist and anarchist view, strongly opposing the monopo listic and imperialistic trends of capitalism's 'gilded age.' This same philosophy of cooperation and harmony with nature led Seton after 1910 to become active in the Boy Scout movement. In the early 1900s he had founded his own organization, the Woodcraft Indians, in which the emphasis was on learning from nature, on being self-sufficient in the wilderness, and on fostering a pacifist and antipioneer spirit among young boys. From his estate in Connecticut, Seton exported the concepts of woodcraft to boys' organizations all across the country. By 1908 hundreds of Woodcraft Indian organizations flourished in the United States. Boys were encouraged to learn the ways of</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 365 Indians, to make their own particular woodcraft costumes (there were no uni forms involved), and to learn the principles of social cooperation through craft, nature study, and sports. Initially friendly to the English scouting movement of Lieutenant-General Baden-Powell, military hero of the Boer War, staunch patriot and imperialist, Seton's influential handbook for his boy's organizations served as the basis for the early scouting movement in both England and the United States. Although appointed Chief Scout of the Boy Scouts of America in 1910, by 1915, Seton became increasingly and vocally opposed to the scouts' emphasis on uniforms, paramilitary activity, and support of World War I. A bitter feud ensued as Wall Street brokers and other ultra-conservatives gained control of the Boy Scout movement, centralized its structure, and made it a vehicle for conformity rather than self and natural exploration. Seton had attempted to build a boys' organization that would mirror the natural instincts of young people toward cooperation, harmony with nature and other human beings, and individuality. That philosophy was obviously at odds with the social and economic times in which Seton lived. Wadland's biography is an admirable attempt to weave together many strands of social and intellectual history. To be sure, Seton is a particularly useful focus for a contextual biography because of the many facets of his career. Wadland is particularly adept at interweaving the strands of Seton's own complex per sonality with the multivarious strands of the Progressive era. For example, like most Progressives, Seton favored the rational and scientific study of nature; unlike most Progressives, however, he held a neo-romantic vision of nature as wilderness, apart from, and towering over, human attempts at control and management. Similarly, like most Progressives, he favored organizations (such as the Boy Scouts or the Woodcraft Indians) that would attempt to develop a national consciousness; yet, unlike most Progressives, he strongly disliked cen tralization and coordinated control. In Seton's personality the contradictions abound even further. A socialist and an anarchist at least in spirit, he had a strong propensity for rubbing shoulders with the aristocratic and wealthy. He professed love of the wilderness and simplicity, yet chose to live most of his life in and around great cities, finally building himself an enormous estate in Connecticut close to New York City. Wadland portrays Seton as a vivid, contradictory, and iconoclastic character in an era that was litde of his making and hardly to his liking. If there are any faults with the present work, it is that the author tries in some ways to cover too much. Some of the attempts to provide background, such as a short summary of the history of late nineteenth- and twentieth-century ethology, or of mid-twentieth-century ecology, are necessarily sketchy and at times super ficial. Yet, Wadland gives the reader some feeling for the development of numerous areas—such as animal art, North American natural history, the con servation movement, and social history—that place Seton's career firmly into</page><page sequence="5">366 Journal of the History of Medicine : July 1982 its historical context. There are useful black-and-white reproductions of several of Seton's paintings or drawings but, unfortunately, no index. Despite the draw backs mentioned above, this volume is an admirable study in social and intel lectual history.</page></plain_text>
