<plain_text><page sequence="1">On Understanding a Sociological Classic' Robert Alun Jones University of Illinois This paper is concerned with the conditions requisite to an under- standing of "classic" works in sociological theory, using Durkheim's Elementary Forms of the Religious Life as the example. Included are (1) a discussion of "presentist" and "historicist" approaches to the history of sociological thought; (2) a criticism of presentist "state- ments of contribution" in the secondary literature on the Elementary Forms; (3) an assessment of Merton's distinction between the "his- tory" and the "systematics" of sociological theory; (4) a reconsider- ation of "contextual" approaches to classical social theory; (5) the proposal of a new approach to the history of sociological theory, illustrated by a very tentative reinterpretation of Durkheim's theory of sacrifice; and (6) a concluding section on the value for sociology itself of an authentic history of sociological thought. The scholar who undertakes a serious study of Durkheim's Elementary Forms of the Religious Life faces an ambiguous situation. On the one hand, while LaCapra (1972, p. 245) has accurately noted discrepant evaluations of the work, the Elementary Forms continues to occupy the attention of sociologists and anthropologists as well as historians of sociological thought. It has provided the reference point for a large number of subsequent em- pirical studies,2 and, though subject to at least an equal number of in- cisive critiques,3 it continues to evoke praise from some of the most es- 1 This paper owes an enormous debt to Quentin Skinner of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton University.

For whatever reasons, therefore, the Elementary Forms stands as one of the very few works in the history of sociological thought which has acquired and retained desig- nation as a "classic text."4 On the other hand, the existent literature on the Elementary Forms reveals considerable disagreement, extending to virtually every facet of historical interpretation. For Parsons (1949, p. 449) and Nisbet (1966, p. 21), Durkheim is concerned with the Hobbesian "problem of order," a view Giddens (1972a, pp. 357, 359) has characterized as a "myth." Concerning aspects of social and historical "context" relevant to the un- derstanding of the Elementary Forms, several writers (Alpert 1939, p. 15; Coser 1971, p. 137) have noted Durkheim's rabbinical background and early religious experiences; Nisbet (1974, p. 156), however, argues that "such answers take us very little of the way" and cites alternative con- textual factors as a corrective. There is substantial agreement upon a number of major intellectual "influences" on the work, although only re- cently has the significance of Spencer (Jones 1974a, 1974b, 1975), LeBon (Douglas 1966, p. 20), Tocqueville (Nisbet 1974, p. 160), and Marx (Gouldner 1958, pp. 26-27, 31; Zeitlin 1968, p. 276) been proposed; subsequently the alleged influence of LeBon has been challenged by Lukes (1972, p. 426, n. 54) and that of Marx by Bierstedt (1969, p. 402), Peel (1971, p. 262), and Jones (1974b, p. 342, n. 2). Still more complicated is the question of the appropriate characteriza- tion of Durkheim's mode of thought. Most recently, of course, the debate has centered on Parsons's (1949, pp. 409-70; 1975, pp. 106-8) depiction of Durkheim as an idealist and action theorist overcoming his earlier positivism, against Pope's (1973, 1975) emphasis upon Durkheim's "social realism"; the discussion, however, has hardly been limited to these figures and modes of thought.5 In addition to this difficult problem of properly (1971a, p. 113, n. 32), Goldenweiser (1915; 1916; 1917; 1923, chap. 16), Kroeber (1971), LaCapra (1972, pp. 250-91), Lowie (1924; 1937, pp. 196-229), Lukes (1972, pp. 435-84), Malinowski (1925), Needham (1963, pp. vii-xlvii), Ross (1930, p. 12), Sorokin (1928, pp. 476-80), Stanner (1967), Van Gennep (1913, 1920), Wallwork (1972, pp. 177, 180-81, 189-90), Worsley (1956), and Zeitlin (1968, pp. 235-80). For further references, see Lukes (1972, pp. 435-84, 497-529) and Seger (1957). 4 The question of why any particular text acquires such a designation is a fascinating one and a worthwhile area of investigation for the sociology of knowledge. For a paral- lel inquiry in political theory, see Levin (1973). 5 On Durkheim's "social realism," note the dissenting views of Alpert (1939, pp. 152- 54) and Bellah (1973, pp. xix-xx). On his "idealism," note the dissenting views of Giddens (1971a, pp. 106-7, 109-10), Nisbet (1974, p. 54), Stone and Farberman (1967, 280</page><page sequence="3">Understanding a Sociological Classic categorizing the Elementary Forms, there are three related (and equally controversial) questions: the continuity or discontinuity from Durkheim's early writings to the Elementary Forms;6 the convergence or divergence of Durkheim and other sociological thinkers;7 and the position of the pp. 149, n. 2; 151, n. 5), and Bellah (1973, pp. xvii-xix), although Parsons has received support from Hughes (1961, p. 285) and Jones (1974a, p. 209, n. 17). Durkheim's "conservatism" in the Elementary Forms has been noted by Nisbet (1974, p. 10), Coser (1964; 1971, pp. 135-36), Zeitlin (1968, pp. 235-36, 277), and LaCapra (1972, p. 270), though questioned by Bellah (1973, pp. xvii-xix) and strongly denied as a "myth" by Giddens (1972a, pp. 357-58, 362-63). There are also disparate discussions of Durkheim's "rationalism" (Coser, 1971, pp. 142-43; Giddens 1972a, p. 363; Pope 1975, p. 112), "evolutionism" (Giddens 1971a, pp. 216-17; Lukes 1972, p. 449; Nisbet 1965, 90-93; 1974, pp. 167-68, 244, 249; Pope 1973, pp. 411-12; 1975, p. 112), "struc- turalism" (Nisbet 1974, p. 74; Parsons 1973, p. 175), "functionalism" (Alpert 1938; 1939, pp. 199-203; Bellah 1959; Coser 1971, pp. 141-42; Giddens 1971a, p. 106; LaCapra 1972, pp. 250-54, 281-82; Nisbet 1974, p. 68; Pierce 1964; Poggi 1972, p. 229; Pope 1973, pp. 411-12), "voluntarism" (Parsons 1949, pp. 448-50; 1975, pp. 107-8; Pope 1973, pp. 407-8, 414), and "pragmatism" (Parsons 1949, p. 44, n. 1; Stone and Farberman 1967, p. 155, n. 23). 6 The central focus here, of course, has been on Parsons's "four stage" thesis (1949, p. 304), according to which the Elementary Forms is viewed as a final, idealist stage in which Durkheim approaches the voluntaristic theory of action; more recently, Parsons (1975) has accepted Bellah's (1973, pp. xxiii, xliv-xlv) view of continuity in Durkheim, though he continues to see substantial development as well (Parsons 1975, p. 106). Other views of substantial change in Durkheim's thought include Hughes's (1961, p. 285) acceptance of Parsons's earlier position, Jones's (1974a, pp. 207-9 and 209, n. 17) view of a move from materialism toward idealism, and Stone and Farberman's (1967, pp. 154-56 and n. 16) view of a profound change in the direction of "social" pragmatism and symbolic interactionism; see also Coser (1971, pp. 129, 132) and Poggi (1972, p. 216). Pope (1973, 1975), on the other hand, views the Elementary Forms as consistent with both Division of Labor and Suicide, though he suggests a possible development from materialism to idealism (1973, pp. 410-11). Giddens (1971a; 1971b; 1972a, p. 360; 1972b, p. 24) and Nisbet (1974, pp. 33-35, 53-54, 59-60, 170-71, 224) have also argued that the Elementary Forms is essentially consistent with Durkheim's earlier work. 7 The most dramatic claim here has, once again, been that of Parsons, with his pos- tulate of convergence (1949, pp. 719-20) among Durkheim, Weber, Pareto, and Mar- shall. Nisbet (1966, pp. 252-53; 1974, p. 36) has supported the view of a significant convergence with Weber, and others (Giddens 1971a, pp. 216-17, 224; Lukes 1972, pp. 457-58, 474-76) have taken a more moderate stance. Bendix (1971, pp. 283, 291- 98), on the other hand, has explicitly opposed Parsons here, and the two have exchanged critical footnotes on the matter (Bendix 1971, p. 297, n. 38; Parsons 1973, p. 177, n. 2). Bendix's view is supported by Collins (1968) and Pope (1973, pp. 413- 14 and n. 8). Another convergence between Durkheim and Marx is found in Gould- ner (1958, pp. 26-27) and more moderately in Zeitlin (1968, pp. 235-36) and Kagan (1938), while LaCapra (1972, pp. 267-70) emphasizes their differences. Hughes (1961, pp. 284-85) has noted the essential similarity between Durkheim and James on re- ligion, while more divergent views have been stated by Coser (1971, p. 137), Lukes (1972, p. 460), and Stone and Ferberman (1967, p. 157, n. 33). Other claims for con- vergence with Durkheim have been made on behalf of Cooley (Alpert 1939, p. 161; Parsons 1964), Tocqueville (Nisbet 1965, p. 77), Simmel (Nisbet 1966, p. 261; 1974, p. 96), Freud (Parsons 1964; 1973, pp. 159-60), Spencer (Peel 1971, pp. 118-19, 184, 208, 238-39, 243), and Mead (Parsons 1964; Stone and Farberman 1967, pp. 156, 159-60). 281</page><page sequence="4">American Journal of Sociology Elementary Forms in relation to contemporary sociological theory.8 The disparity of views on these and other issues suggests that there is sub- stantial confusion over how Durkheim's classic work is to be properly understood. The reader will perhaps be relieved to know that it is not my present purpose to enter this debate and add still another interpretation to those cited, an abstention not only forced by reasons of space but required by adherence to the methodological principles set forth below. First, I strongly doubt that substantial agreement will ever be achieved within the terms summarized above; second, even were such agreement forthcoming, I doubt that it would properly serve the ostensive purpose of such inter- pretations-the understanding of Durkheim's classic work; and third, the difficulties which provoke this critique and proposal are by no means peculiar to the literature on the Elementary Forms alone. Indeed, since Lukes (1972) this literature has probably been superior to that on Weber or Marx. Rather, my focus on the Elementary Forms is intended to be purely exemplary-to illustrate problems which are endemic to current practices in the history of classical social theory. PRESENTISM AND HISTORICISM IN THE HISTORY OF SOCIOLOGICAL THOUGHT All historians would agree that history is a discipline which attempts to make true statements about people who have lived and events which have occurred in the past (Murphey 1973, p. 1); the disagreement has been over the means by which such statements are made and confirmed. Such self-conscious reflection on historical method has not been typical of his- torians of sociological thought; recently, however, serious methodological questions have been raised by Stocking (1965), Peel (1971, pp. 249-65), and Tones (1972. 1974b. 1975). These writers, all insDired in various 8 The interesting fact here is that we have distinct interpretations of the Elementary Forms corresponding to each of the respective "schools" of contemporary sociolog- ical theory: for Parsons (1949, pp. 439-41, 448, 450), Durkheim is "on the verge of" the voluntaristic theory of action and, more recently (Parsons 1973, pp. 160-66, 171- 73; 1975, p. 106), the general theory of action systems; for Stone and Farberman (1967), Durkheim is "on the edge of rapprochement" with symbolic interactionism; for Gouldner (1958, pp. 26-27, 31) and Zeitlin (1968, pp. 235-36, 276), the Elemen- tary Forms is part of the continuing debate with Marx's ghost. Other scholars sug- gest that Durkheim has made contributions to "structural-functionalism" (Alpert 1938; 1939, pp. 199-203; Bellah 1959; Coser 1971, pp. 141-42; LaCapra 1972, pp. 250-54, 281-82; Nisbet 1974, p. 68), but this is denied by Pierce (1960, p. 165) and Poggi (1972, p. 229); to a theory of social change (Bellah 1959; Pope 1973; pp. 410- 11; Parsons 1973, p. 157), but this was earlier denied by Parsons (1949, p. 448); to a theory of alienation (Nisbet 1966, p. 264), but this is denied by Zeitlin (1968, pp. 277-80); to "symbolic realism" (Bellah 1973, pp. I-lii; Parsons 1973, pp. 159-60); and to contemporary French structuralism (Parsons 1973, p. 175). 282</page><page sequence="5">Understanding a Sociological Classic ways by Butterfield (1931) and Kuhn (1962), have presented an essen- tially revisionist argument with both critical and corrective dimensions. Critically, this argument maligns previous statements in the history of sociological thought as either "presentist" and "Whiggish" (Butterfield 1931, p. v) or flawed by "paradigmatic preconceptions" (Kuhn 1962, pp. 43-51). The most articulate summary of this critique is Stocking's: The Whig historian reduces the mediating processes by which the totality of an historical past produces the totality of its consequent future to a search for the origins of certain present phenomena. He seeks out in the past phenomena which seem to resemble those of concern in the present, and then moves forward in time by tracing lineages up to the present in simple sequential movement. When this abridging procedure is charged with a normative commitment to the phenomena whose origins are sought, the linear movement is called "progress" and those who seem to abet it are "progressive." The result is Whiggish history. Because it is informed by a normative commitment, its characteristic interpretive mode is judg- ment rather than understanding, and history becomes the field for a dra- matic struggle between children of light and children of darkness. Because it wrenches the individual historical phenomenon from the complex net- work of its contemporary context in order to see it in abstracted relation- ship to analogues in the present, it is prone to anachronistic misinterpreta- tion. Because it assumes in advance the progressive character of historical change, it is less interested in the complex processes by which change emerges than in agencies which direct it, whether they be great men, specific deterministic forces, or the "logic" of historical development itself. [1965, pp. 3-4; see also Jones 1974b, pp. 341-42] As a corrective, these writers consistently urge the rigorous study of the social and historical context of past sociological thought; for example, "to understand what a theory means is, at least in part, to understand the unique society to which it refers, the purposes for which it was constructed, and the questions it was meant to answer" (Jones 1974b, p. 355); in other words, we must "understand the science of a given period in its own terms" (Stocking 1965, p. 8). It is difficult to assess the impact which this argument has had upon historians of sociological thought; but at least one prominent scholar (Nisbet 1972, p. 234) refers to the "increased and still increasing" atten- tion being given to the social and historical foundations of sociological theory, a judgment offered in praise of a distinguished effort in this direction (Coser 1971). The time seems appropriate, therefore, to evaluate both the critical and the corrective claims of these writers. I will argue that the critical claim, though in need of two important qualifications, is severely damaging to the existent literature on the Elementary Forms. Subsequently, I will suggest that the corrective claim is itself in need of substantial revision. As for the critical claim, any blanket condemnation of "presentism" 283</page><page sequence="6">American Journal of Sociology in the history of sociological thought ignores certain fundamental facts about historical method. Two important caveats must therefore be entered. First, at the beginning of any historical inquiry, we must make some im- portant decisions about what is worthy of study; and it is difficult to see how these decisions can reasonably be made by standards other than those operant in the present. The alternative-to apply only those criteria of significance which were accepted at the relevant historical time (Butter- field 1931, pp. 9-31)-is highly problematic; the endorsement of such judgments would create, for example, a history of 19th-century thought in which the ambiance of Spencer eclipsed all else. These "important decisions," therefore, must be made according to our own, present criteria of what is sociologically rational, significant, and interesting (Dunn 1968, pp. 97-98; Skinner 1974, p. 281). Second, to say that the Elementary Forms is evidence for Durkheim's sociological thought is to classify it-first as evidence and then as evi- dence for some particular activity (Murphey 1973, p. 31). It is also clear that we can classify the unfamiliar only in terms of the familiar (Dunn 1968, pp. 97-98); thus there must be at least some "family resemblances" which connect the various instances of a given activity, in order for us to recognize and define any specific example thereof (Skinner 1969, pp. 5-6). In other words, we do not know a priori that the Elementary Forms is an expression of sociological thought; and we cannot classify it as such without bringing to bear our own present conception of the nature of that activity. Thus we cannot begin a study of the Elementary Forms without at least some "presentist" preconceptions about what we expect to find. The existence of preconceptions, therefore, is not in question; for within the limits set above they are unavoidable. The difficulty for writing good history arises when the historian's familiarity with and commitment to such preconceptions leads him to ignore two basic criteria for making true statements about the past (Skinner 1969, pp. 28-30); the nature of these criteria and the confusion engendered when they are ignored can be best revealed through a consideration of some of the statements made concerning the Elementary Forms. STATEMENTS OF CONTRIBUTION Among the most frequent and problematic statements made about Durk- heim's Elementary Forms are those generated by what has been termed the "mythology of doctrines" (Skinner 1969a, pp. 7-16) or the "humanist- platonism" (Kuklick 1972, pp. 437, 440-43) of intellectual historians. The difficulty here is that the historian, bound by his or her presentist precon- ceptions, examines the Elementary Forms in an effort to find Durkheim's "contribution" to certain theories, thematic ideas, or problems regarded as 284</page><page sequence="7">Understanding a Sociological Classic currently constitutive of our discipline. This approach, for example, gen- erates statements to the effect that Durkheim has contributed substantially to various "theories" the voluntaristic theory of action, structural-func- tionalism, symbolic interactionism, etc.-in his classic work. The effort to make such statements inevitably requires the use of what can only be called dubious strategies of exegetical analysis. Scattered and isolated remarks are gathered, sometimes heavily italicized (Stone and Farberman 1967, pp. 151, 153-55) and conjoined into a systematic "doctrine" on one of the mandatory themes; where Durkheim's own terminology is "obscure" or "confused," more modern terms are substituted to clarify, for example, Durkheim's contribution to the theory of the integration of social systems (Parsons 1964, pp. 121, 128); where such strategies prove insufficient, previously obscure works are raised to new prominence to demonstrate that "social pragmatism" (Stone and Farberman 1967) or "voluntarism" (Cohen 1975) is "really there."9 Where the systematic doctrine is not yet manifest, the strategy often reverts to statements concerning Durkheim's prescient and clairvoyant "anticipation" of modern thought: Durkheim "points in the direction of" the voluntaristic conception of action (Parsons 1949, p. 439); he is "on the edge of rapprochement" with symbolic interactionism (Stone and Farber- man 1967); or he is "on the verge of, or . . . actually obscurely states" a position compatible with "symbolic realism" (Bellah 1973, p. lii). Such statements are typically and cautiously conjoined with indications that this is only the "main line" (Parsons 1949, p. 440) or "main thrust" (Stone and Farberman 1967, p. 156) of Durkheim's thought and also with obligatory, though vague and unconvincing, "explanations" of why Durkheim "overshot the mark" (Parsons 1949, p. 445), was "unable to make full transition" (Stone and Farberman 1967, p. 149), or "never fully made this last step" (Bellah 1973, p. lii). In a discipline in which theoretical perspectives change rapidly, it is not surprising that histories written from such an approach are in need of periodic revision; this fact is particularly relevant to Durkheim's "con- tributions" to a "theory of social change" and the "general system of action." In 1937, for example, Parsons noted how "conspicuous by its absence from his thought is any clearcut theory of social change" and suggested that the problem was "altogether outside his field of interest" (1949, p. 448). As noted by Pope (1973, p. 411), the later criticism of 9 For Stone and Farberman, the work is Pragmatisme et sociologie, and they respect- fully note that this work, first published in 1955, was unavailable to Parsons in his 1937 interpretation. It is worth noting, therefore, that the subsequent availability of Pragmatisme et sociologie has not modified Parsons's interpretation in the direction of symbolic interactionism. For Cohen, the work is Moral Education; committed to the denial that "voluntarism" is "really there," Pope (1975, p. 114) thus denies that Moral Education is "one of Durkheim's major works in sociological theory." 285</page><page sequence="8">American Journal of Sociology Parsons's theories for their alleged static implications led to reinterpre- tation of Durkheim. The result was that the newly obligatory theory of social change was "discovered" (Bellah 1959), a judgment in which Parsons now concurs (Parsons 1973, p. 157). Similarly, in 1937 Parsons (1949, p. 439) argued that Durkheim was moving toward the voluntaristic theory of social action; subsequently inspired by the recent research on DNA, the new genetics, and the biological theories of Claude Bernard and W. B. Cannon, however, Parsons has acquired a "substantially altered perspec- tive" which places the Elementary Forms within the framework of the ''general system of action" rather than that of the social system alone (1973, p. 163). Parsons points to "striking similarities" (p. 160) between the Elementary Forms and recent genetic theory in biology, notes "striking parallels" (p. 161) between Durkheim's work and recent linguistic theories, and suggests that Durkheim "was well on the way" to the general theory of action. It is even suggested that this was what Durkheim really "meant" (1975, p. 106) and that "it was one of the principal messages that he was trying to convey" in the Elementary Forms (1973, pp. 160-61). Still another dubious strategy is the hypostatization of a "single co- herent body of theory" (Parsons 1949, p. xxi) or set of "unit ideas" (Nisbet 1966, pp. 3-7) as substantive entities. Since these entities are typically characterized first, the task becomes one of searching for and abstracting from the classic works various approximations of these ideal types (Skinner 1969, p. 11); the results are then credited as "contribu- tions" to such reified ideas as well as evidence that the ideas were in some sense immanent in history to begin with. In such accounts, ideas typically assume a reality which transcends that of the mere agents who think them (Skinner 1969, p. 11; Kuklick 1972, pp. 437, 441); the argument is thus carried on at a high level of abstraction. Durkheim's mind is reduced to a battlefield on which positivism, empiricism, and idealism play the major roles; if Durkheim fails to attain a voluntaristic theory, it is due to the similar effect (though for opposite reasons) of his positivism and idealism; and he is attracted to idealism because he has never outgrown his empiri- cism (Parsons 1949, p. 446). Elsewhere, the history of sociology is con- ceived as a "kind of magnetic field" in which Marx and Tocqueville represent the "two poles of attraction" and the Elementary Forms con- tributes to the ultimate triumph of the latter (Nisbet 1966, p. viii). This strategy of freeing ideas from their agents secures similar advantages to the historian in relation to his evidence; the modern "content" of the "idea of alienation" thus owes more to the "contributions" of Durkheim than to those of Marx (Nisbet 1966, pp. 264, 306). Ultimately, however, one is forced to admit that, in certain cases, Durkheim has simply "failed" to provide a systematic doctrine on certain obligatory themes. Several strategies are available here. If it is "difficult 286</page><page sequence="9">Understanding a Sociological Classic to understand" Durkheim because he "neglected" or "confused" certain distinctions, his construction can be "further elaborated" by stating it in "terms more modern than he himself used" (Parsons 1964, p. 121); or, if a "line of argument was open which Durkheim did not take," the historian can supply Durkheim with arguments which he "would have" made if he had made the arguments which he so unaccountably did not make (LaCapra 1972, p. 215). Most typically, however, the strategy is simply to criticize Durkheim for so consistently failing to become our- selves; indeed, judgment rather than understanding is a characteristic feature of the approach as a whole. If Durkheim fails to elucidate in the Division of Labor certain ideas which can be found in the Elementary Forms, he is not yet "mature" (Nisbet 1974, p. 90; Parsons 1975, p. 108); the fact that similar claims are rarely made for the Comte of the Positive Polity suggests that something beyond mere chronology is at play here. If the mandatory arguments are still not pursued in the Elementary Forms, their omission is simply a "failure" (La Capra 1972, pp. 260, 266, 270; Parsons 1949, p. 441; 1964, p. 138). For Durkheim is clearly obligated to answer the questions which we might put to him; if he does not, it is because he "does not face" certain possibilities about constitutive symbols (Bellah 1973, p. li); "does not seem to notice" that "it is still necessary to explain" the integral status of collective representations (Bierstedt 1966, pp. 205-6); is "genuinely confused" over the distinction between values and norms (Parsons 1964, p. 138); or, Nisbet notwithstanding, simply "refuses" to see the alienating consequences of religion (Zeitlin 1968, p. 278).10 The essential difficulty with the statements of contribution generated by this approach, therefore, is that they beg three seemingly obvious questions about Durkheim. First, we might reasonably ask whether Durk- heim can be said to have contributed to a subject or debate to which he could not, in principle, have meant or intended to contribute; for in many of the foregoing cases the terms of such a subject or debate could not have been available to Durkheim and would have been meaningless to him (Skinner 1969, pp. 7-8). Second, even if it can be shown (as it rarely is) that such meanings were in fact available to him, we might still ask 10These comments, together with the variety of authors cited, should make clear my reaction to the recent criticisms of Talcott Parsons by Whitney Pope (1973, 1975). Pope has supplied a partial corrective to Parsons's treatment of Durkheim (though the subsequent debate hardly renders this self-evident). The difficulty is that Pope views the interpretive problem as specific to Parsons alone; on the contrary, the prob- lem is endemic to sociology as a whole, and the special case of Parsons merely illus- trates the enormous difficulty of writing "history" while burdened with one's own theoretical preconceptions. My own critique is thus not of any single individual but of an institutional fact; and ironically this makes both my critique and my corrective proposal more "sociological" than Pope's (see Conclusion). 287</page><page sequence="10">American Journal of Sociology whether he actually intended his arguments to be taken in this way (Skinner 1969, p. 9; Kuklick 1972, pp. 442-43). Finally, even if the historian claims that these two conditions have been met, we are left with a third, seemingly unanswerable question; for if it is claimed that Durkheim really meant what the authors above say he meant we might reasonably ask why he so consistently failed to make his meaning clear, leaving the historian to reconstruct this meaning painfully through the various strategies cited above (Skinner 1969, p. 10; Kuklick 1972, pp. 442-43). The fact that such questions are so consistently begged sug- gests that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to make statements about Durkheim's "contributions" which are, in fact, true statements about Durkheim.11 The nature of the "two basic criteria for making true statements about the past," referred to above, should by now be clear. The first is that Durkheim must be granted "privileged access" to his own intentions- that is, he cannot be said to have meant or done something if he could not, at least in principle, have accepted the statement as an accurate account of what he was saying or doing (Skinner 1969, pp. 28-29). In other words, our statements about Durkheim must fall within and make use of the range of descriptions which he could have applied to what he was doing; if, on the contrary, our statements are dependent on descriptive and classificatory criteria not available to Durkheim, it is difficult to see how they can be statements about Durkheim at all.12 This is precisely the flaw in statements to the effect that Durkheim was "contributing" to theories or schools of thought that did not exist in his time, "con- verging" with other thinkers with whom he was unconcerned, or "antici- pating" later ideas of which he was unaware. None of these can be, in any way, an account of anything Durkheim was doing; indeed, in most cases, such statements cannot even be formulated in terms that would have made sense to Durkheim. Inversely, it is equally inappropriate to criticize Durkheim for "failing" to contribute, converge, or anticipate at some point; for to say that he "failed" presupposes that he could have had the intention to try; and for the most part such intentions were, by definition, unavailable. 11 In an earlier, lengthier draft, this criticism of anachronistic practices was extended to "statements on convergence" (or "divergence") and "statements of coherence" as well. The first represent the effort to have Durkheim converge with (or diverge from) thinkers of whom he was not (and, in some cases, could not have been) aware; the second represent the effort to lend to Durkheim's work a coherence which it may not have attained (or might not have been intended to attain). Since these efforts involve most of the same dubious strategies and beg the same obvious questions, they have been removed to shorten this final draft. 12For the philosophical defense of this argument, see Hampshire (1959). Also note Skinner's qualifications (1969, p. 28; 1972c, p. 405). 288</page><page sequence="11">Understanding a Sociological Classic The second criterion is that the historian must never ignore the special nature of the activity about which he makes statements (Skinner 1966, pp. 209-10; 1969, pp. 29-30; Dunn 1968, pp. 87-88). For whatever else it might be, sociological "thinking" is hardly the kind of activity that can be accurately described as the systematic manipulation of propositions or even a uniformly purposeful act. Our own experience would suggest that, on the contrary, it is often a conceptually disordered activity in which we frequently become confused, change our minds, adopt incom- patible views, and coptradict ourselves. The fault of a number of state- ments, therefore, is that they quickly cease to represent anything we might recognize as sociological thinking; instead, contradictions are resolved (or regretted), complex intended acts are reproduced as unitary perfor- mances, myriad usages of words are reduced to their "essential" meaning, and detailed (and sometimes confused) argument becomes "metaphor" and "motif." If we wish to make true statements about Durkheim's thought, we must first grant it status as a real activity (Dunn 1968, p. 87). ON THE HISTORY AND SYSTEMATICS OF SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY A major objection to this critique13 has been that the authors criticized (e.g., Parsons) are sociologists rather than historians, are not making "historical" statements, and thus should not be held accountable for such blatantly anachronistic practices. Initially, this argument strikes me as curious and invites several observations. First, the question of professional identity is irrelevant, for whatever our academic titles, we are all bound by the standards which govern the particular activity in which we are engaged; the point thus reverts to the second question posed by this ob- jection: whether or not this activity is "history" in any real sense. An initial observation here is that several of the authors in question seem to say they are writing history (albeit something else as well)-as in Parsons's statement that "the writings treated are as truly documents as are manorial court rolls of the Middle Ages, and as such, present problems of understanding and interpretation" (1968, p. vii). Second, the results of their investigations certainly look like history, in the sense that their writings make reference to Durkheim's intentions and meaning and their statements are conjoined into a narrative format typical of the history of ideas. Third, it is therefore not surprising that such accounts are re- garded as history that is, they would be included under the classification "histories of sociological thought" by most members of the profession. Finally, such accounts certainly seem to be history in the broad sense de- 13 Earlier versions of these arguments were presented at the meetings of the Midwest Sociological Society in St. Louis (April 1976) and the American Sociological Asso- ciation in New York (August 1976). 289</page><page sequence="12">American Journal of Sociology fined above (Murphey 1973, p. 1); for these interpretations are clearly embodied in "statements," these statements at least purport to be "about past people and events," and the authors would surely maintain that they are in some sense "true." To argue otherwise would be to raise serious questions about the identity-indeed, the very existence-of the "history of sociological thought." Nonetheless, the anachronisms notwithstanding, there is clearly a sense in which these statements about Durkheim represent a legitimate and important activity in sociological theory and one which is not strictly "historical." With William James, therefore, we might profit from an old scholastic adage that whenever we meet a contradiction we must make a distinction; and, almost irresistibly, an already existing one beckons- that between the "history" and the "systematics" of sociological theory (Merton 1948; 1957, pp. 4-5; 1967, pp. 1-37).'4 The latter category, Merton suggests, "represents the highly selective accumulation of those small parts of earlier theory which have thus far survived the tests of empirical research"; the former, on the other hand, "includes also the far greater mass of conceptions which fell to bits when confronted with em- pirical test. It includes also the false starts, the archaic doctrines and the fruitless errors of the past." And it is the confusion of the two, Merton concludes, which is ultimately both attractive and fatal (1957, pp. 5, 4). The distinction certainly has a descriptive appeal-a truly "historical" account of past theory is likely to be more inclusive than its "system- atic" counterpart; and in fact it is precisely the noninclusive quality of the Structure of Social Action that leads Parsons to describe it as "not . . . in the first instance . . . a study in intellectual history" (1968, p. xiii). It is doubtful, however, that inclusiveness is sufficient to serve as the distin- guishing criterion of an authentic "history" of sociological theory (nor does Merton suggest that it does). It would seem, for example, that a statement about the Elementary Forms does not cease being historical simply because it refers to one of Durkheim's subsequently validated propositions; as long as we limit our referents to Durkheim's highly con- firmed propositions, therefore, there is no basis whatever for distinguish- ing between history and systematics. Inversely, a statement about the Elementary Forms could scarcely become historical simply on the ground that it includes reference to a subsequently disproven assertion. The de- scriptive difference cited by Merton therefore does not enable us to dis- tinguish adequately between the history of classical social theory and that other activity which it so closely resembles. 14 I have developed the comments which follow in more detail in a separate essay, "On the Distinction between the 'History' and 'Systematics' of Sociological Theory" (forthcoming). 290</page><page sequence="13">Understanding a Sociological Classic What, then, is the defining characteristic of an authentic history of sociological theory? An answer to this question can be gained by return- ing to the source of our original definition, where a lengthy and more philosophically inclined argument arrives at the conclusion that "what is distinctive about history as we have defined it is neither its separate terminology nor its peculiar explanations, but the fact that its statements refer to events and objects in the past. It is this reference to the events and objects of the past which marks off history as a special subject, and it is the problems which arise from this reference which require special meth- ods, special techniques, special training, and a special relation of theory and data" (Murphey 1973, p. 6). It is this reference to the past, there- fore, which distinguishes history from other disciplines; and this in turn provides the clue to the resolution of our contradiction. The intended force of the numerous examples cited from the secondary literature on the Elementary Forms was to demonstrate that such statements are not in fact about Durkheim; they describe actions he could not have per- formed and meanings he could not have intended. Since they are not about Durkheim, they can only be statements about the subjective state of the "historian's" mind. In fact, it seems reasonable to argue that the em- pirical content of the statement "Here Durkheim anticipates Mead" is nothing more than "This passage in Durkheim reminds me of a passage in Mead"; clearly there is no effort to say anything about Durkheim's actions, intentions, and meaning or to go much beyond a more or less phenomenological rendering of the content of one's own imagination. This is not to demean the activity of reading the classics for their enormous heuristic value, for that is clearly a legitimate and important activity in our efforts to expand our sociological imaginations; nor are such state- ments untrue, insofar as they are taken as descriptions of our own sub- jective states rather than descriptions of past meanings. But they are not historical statements, because they are not in any meaningful sense about the past. We thus have two classes of statements, both of which may be true but only one of which is about the past; and, as Merton suggests, it is not one class or the other but the confusion of the two which is both attractive and fatal. For, as we have already seen, statements of the second type give almost all the appearance of being statements of the first; they are thus accepted as the "history" of sociological theory throughout the discipline, and it is only with the appearance of critiques such as the present one that their authors hastily interject that they were not exactly writing "history" in the first place-which, of course, they were not. But if such confusion is so fatal, why is it so attractive? An answer can be found in Gouldner's excellent introduction to Durkheim's Socialism, which suggests that a sociological "myth," like all myths, "performs 291</page><page sequence="14">American Journal of Sociology certain ongoing social functions for those holding it. . . . While it may make no difference to the substance of a science concerning who, in fact, its founding father was, nonetheless, shared professional beliefs concern- ing this may be significant for a discipline's professional organization and its practitioner's self-images. A founding father is a professional symbol. . . .Where there are conflicts, by later generations, concerning who their founding father was, we suspect that this may be a serious question es- sentially reflecting a dispute over the character of the profession" (1958, p. 12, n. 5). Thus, as Durkheim and especially Halbwachs remind us, a mythological past performs important functions for present social orga- nization; this explains in part why there is an "interpretation" of the Elementary Forms which dutifully corresponds to each of the schools of contemporary sociological theory (see n. 7 above). But once again this is mythology, not history. THE CONTEXTUAL ALTERNATIVE Regardless of what it is, however, it still leaves us far short of a reason- able account of past sociological thought. With the qualifications stated earlier, therefore, the critical claims of the opponents of presentist or Whiggish "histories" appear justified; and their corrective proposals thus deserve serious examination. The argument in favor of contextual anal- yses of sociological thought is a compelling one, for by emphasizing the understanding of past thought "in its own terms" it promises to avoid many of the historical absurdities summarized above. Furthermore, such contextual analyses, whether citing an antecedent or contemporary intel- lectual "influence" or the sociohistorical infrastructure, bear the added promise of providing statements about the Elementary Forms that hold explanatory power. The examination of actual historical practice, however, suggests that the achievements of such an approach have been quite limited. One problem arises when an argument in the Elementary Forms reminds the reader of an earlier argument by another writer or appears to contra- dict that writer. In an effort to abridge the overwhelming complexity of past ideas and, further, to make statements that hold explanatory force, the historian may assume that it was Durkheim's intention to refer to that writer or idea and may thus make statements concerning the "influence" of the latter on the former (Skinner 1969, p. 25). Such use of the term "influence" has been extremely frequent in histories of sociological thought (see above); and indeed the almost seductive appeal held by this mode of "explanation" is entirely understandable. First, the concept of "intel- lectual influence" is sufficiently "vague" (Jones 1943, p. 201) and "loose- limbed" (Skinner 1966, p. 202) to escape the more rigorous demands of 292</page><page sequence="15">Understanding a Sociological Classic demonstrating historical causation15 while still maintaining the appear- ance of at least explaining something; we are thus told that ideas are in some sense dependent on others, though not entirely dependent, and that these ideas are alike but not exactly alike (Skinner 1966, p. 204). Moreover, if the case can be made for an influential party of sufficient present stature, the historian can "explain" aspects of the Elementary Forms without "vulgarizing" or "debasing" the explanandum. Such an advantage at least partially accounts for (though by no means justifies) Zeitlin's choice of Marx rather than Schaffle as the "ghost" with whom Durkheim was allegedly debating. The attractions above notwithstanding, however, the concept of influ- ence can have little explanatory power if its application is not consistent with at least some minimal standards; it seems appropriate, therefore, to inquire into the conditions sufficient or at least necessary for making demonstrably true statements about the influences on the Elementary Forms. First, there must at least be some genuine similarity between pas- sages in the Elementary Forms and those of the antecedent thinker (Skin- ner 1969, p. 26). The difficulty here is that it is virtually impossible to define such similarity in terms that would permit verification (Jones 1943, p. 196); and mere similarity, even if verified, is not enough, as the exam- ple of Newton, Leibniz, and calculus (indeed, the entire literature on "independent discovery") makes clear (Jones 1943, pp. 199-200). Second, there must be demonstrable evidence of Durkheim's awareness of the antecedent party or idea (Jones 1975). The only sure key here is Durk- heim's explicit testimony to such awareness, as in the case of Robertson Smith; more frequently, we are left with statements to the effect that Durkheim was at least in a position to be aware, as in the case of Tocqueville (Nisbet 1974, p. 160). Finally, the historian must be able to demonstrate dependence of certain features of the Elementary Forms upon the ideas of the antecedent party. Such demonstrations would take the counterfactual form of arguing that the Elementary Forms would be different were it not for the existence of the antecedent party. The his- torian must then demonstrate that the passage in question cannot, with equal probability, be referred to the influence of any other writer (Wiener 1961, p. 537; Skinner 1969, p. 26). Further, it must also be demonstrated that the probability of the alleged similarity being random is very low, so that independent articulation of apparently similar ideas is a minor possibility (Skinner 1969, p. 26). Adherence to these conditions of similarity, awareness, and dependence would seem to be a minimum criterion for actually demonstrating an influ- 15 For the demands of such explanations, see Hempel (1942, 1965), Hempel and Oppenheim (1948); see also the treatment of Hempel's argument in Skinner (1966) and Murphey (1973, pp. 67-100). 293</page><page sequence="16">American Journal of Sociology ence; as the more circumspect historians have admitted,16 however, the criterion is very difficult, if not impossible, to meet in practice. The influ- ence-model nonetheless seems almost irresistibly attractive, either in the form of a linear sequence, in which individual ideas beget other individual ideas in a manner strikingly similar to the first chapters of Chronicles, or in the form of multiple citations of potential antecedent influences, pre- sumably substantiated by quoted passages reminiscent of the Elementary Forms. In neither case is the nature of the alleged bond between antece- dent party and Durkheim specified and subjected to procedures of verifi- cation; instead, the reader is left to "fill in" the missing connections and argument and thus to judge the plausibility of the relationship subjec- tively.17 This practice of course ignores two essential canons of historical method: first, it is never sufficient to demonstrate what was possibly the case, for the probability of one explanation must always be assessed in relation to others; second, the burden of proof for any historical asser- tion rests on its author, not on its reader (Fischer 1970, p. 63). These observations entered, we might reasonably ask whether the entire reper- toire of einfluss studies in the history of sociological thought cannot be reduced to the question of which ideas in some great books remind us of other ideas in other great books (Skinner 1969, p. 26). An alternative mode of explanation cites the social and historical con- text, whether in Marxian or other terms, as the determinant of Durk- heim's classic work. Once again, however, the explanatory promise is rarely realized in substantive practice, and we might ask with Stefan Collini (1977) whether the laudable insistence upon sociological expla- nations for such intellectual developments has not already outrun our capacity to produce them. It is surely commonplace to observe that state- ments of this kind are typically couched in the most nebulous terms or, where greater specificity is obtained, it is rendered in the form of a multi- tude of allegedly significant antecedent conditions whose relative explana- tory weight remains unspecified. And once again, while such accounts of the antecedent social conditions of the Elementary Forms masquerade as explanations, there is never any effort to define the nature of the alleged 16 While Lukes (1972, p. 462) cites a number of "crowd psychologists"-Sighele, LeBon, Tarde, et al.-by whom Durkheim was "doubtless affected," he also admits that "there is no evidence that he was specifically influenced by any of these." Simi- larly, Coser (1971, p. 151) cites the possible influence of several "anti-Enlightenment traditionalists"-Bonald, Maistre, Haller, et al.-yet grants that "there exists no evi- dence . . . that Durkheim ever read any of these thinkers . . . this is all in the realm of conjecture. One can point to startling similarities and significant differences . . . but cannot prove any direct influence." Even Nisbet has granted this in a personal com- munication to Coser dated January 5, 1969 (see Coser 1971, p. 151, n. 39). 17 This fact has important implications for the question of narrative synthesis as well as the larger question of the nature of historical causation. For an interesting discussion of these, see Murphey (1973, pp. 123-24). 294</page><page sequence="17">Understanding a Sociological Classic connection (causal, functional, or otherwise) or to demonstrate that the existence of the connection can be confirmed. There are several reasons for these shortcomings. First, there is the historian's recognition of the enormous difficulties involved in confirming such statements (Murphey 1973, pp. 131-32, 134-53). For the "facts" of the social context are infinite and may be as ambiguous as the text of the Elementary Forms itself; the appropriate selection and emphasis of contextual factors in a demonstrable explanation is, to say the least, un- likely. Second, even if confirmation were not so problematic, there is still the historian's reluctance to subject the Elementary Forms to such an analysis. For the major point of studying such classics, it is argued, is that they contain "nuclear," "core," or "unit" ideas of continuing rele- vance to sociological theory. To suggest that, on the contrary, the Ele- mentary Forms can be "explained" as the product of particular antecedent social conditions is tantamount to a denial that it contains such timeless ideas and thus seems to be a denial of the entire justification for its study (Skinner 1969, pp. 5, 42-43; Kuklick, in press).18 Finally, even if the difficulties above could be overcome, the resulting explanations would still leave us short of the ostensive goal of our in- quiry-the understanding of the Elementary Forms; for, while a knowl- edge of the antecedent causal conditions of the Elementary Forms may be a necessary condition for its understanding, there are substantial grounds for arguing that such knowledge will remain, at the very least, insufficient to that purpose (Dunn 1968, pp. 94-95; Skinner 1969, pp. 42-44). In addition to-and quite outside-a knowledge of its social and historical context, an understanding of the Elementary Forms might equally well pre- suppose a grasp of the intended point of that work for Durkheim.19 Philo- sophical defenses of contextual models are still possible, of course, on the ground that intentions and motives are themselves antecedents and con- tingently related to the writing of the Elementary Forms (Ayer 1967); 18 With Kuklick and Skinner, however, I would suggest that such a justification for the study of the Elementary Forms is misconceived. A more substantial justification can be found in the Conclusion of this paper and in Skinner (1969, pp. 52-53). 19 In a convincing defense of this assertion, Skinner (1969, p. 44) observes that ar- guments in favor of such causal explanations of actions performed at will are typically supported by examples of simple and routine behavior-e.g., putting on a coat (Ayer 1967, pp. 16-17) rather than writing the Elementary Forms. Thus, "The question of the point of the action is very easily made to seem wholly transparent, or quite un- important. And it is a further striking fact that the examples which have made it seem most plausible to suppose that puzzles about actions may be resolved simply by stating the conditions of their occurrence have often been those in which a lawyer would speak of diminished responsibility, and on which we might more colloquially speak of behaving pointlessly-cases of being drunk or drugged, of losing one's temper, and so on" (Skinner 1969, p. 44; see also MacIntyre 1966, pp. 222-23). For parallel arguments against the application of causality models to the understanding of "diffi- cult ideas," see Kuklick (in press) and Dunn (1968, pp. 94-95). 295</page><page sequence="18">American Journal of Sociology this argument, however, has been successfully countered by Skinner (1969, pp. 44-48), who claims that it rests upon two misconceptions about the conditions requisite to an understanding of such works. The first confusion rests upon the failure to distinguish, initially, be- tween "motive" and "intention" and, more important, between two dif- ferent senses in which the latter term is commonly used: To speak of a writer's motives seems invariably to be to speak of a con- dition antecedent to, and contingently connected with, the appearance of his works. But to speak of a writer's intentions may be either to refer to his plan or design to create a certain type of work (his intention to do x) or to refer to and describe an actual work in a certain way (as embodying a particular intention in x-ing). In the former type of case we seem (as in talking about motives) to be alluding to a contingent antecedent condition of the appearance of the work. In the latter type of case, however, we seem to be alluding to a feature of the work itself, and to be characterizing it, in terms of its embodiment of a particular aim or intention, and thus in terms of its having a particular point. [Skinner 1972c, p. 401: see also Anscombe 1957] The second misconception is that "meaning" and "understanding" are correlative terms; here my argument relies heavily on the linguistic theo- ries of J. L. Austin. The major achievement of Austin (1962) was to define sentences as instruments through which acts are performed and thus to shift attention to the nature of the "speech acts" involved in their utter- ance (Murphey 1973, p. 45). The locutionary act, for example, refers to the utterance of certain words with a certain meaning-in other words, a more or less definite sense and reference (Austin 1962, p. 94). By an illocutionary act, on the other hand, Austin (p. 99) refers to "the perfor- mance of an act in saying something as opposed to the performance of [the locutionary] act of saying something." Thus if I say, "The door is open," I perform the locutionary act of saying something with a sense and reference; simultaneously, however I may be performing the illocutionary act of stating, hinting, exclaiming, warning, and so on (see also Urmson 1967, p. 213). Austin also insists that to utter any serious utterance is always to speak not only with a certain meaning but also with a certain "illocutionary force"; and to gain "uptake" of this illocutionary force is to understand what the agent was doing in issuing that particular utterance -or, as Skinner says, to understand the act performed is to understand the agent's primary intentions in issuing that particular utterance (1972c, p. 402). A METHODOLOGICAL PROPOSAL, WITH A TENTATIVE ILLUSTRATION T-he problem of understanding the Elementary Forms (or any other work in classical sociological theory) is thus defined as one of recovering 296</page><page sequence="19">Understanding a Sociological Classic Durkheim's intentions in writing that work; and this definition in turn yields a set of methodological prescriptions whereby understanding may be achieved. Negatively, we must limit the range of our statements about the Elementary Forms to those which Durkheim himself might in principle have accepted and also to those which are consistent with what we know about the activity of sociological thinking. Positively, we must focus on the conventions governing the treatment of issues or theories with which the text is concerned (Skinner 1972c, p. 406). For as an extended act of communication, the very existence of the Elementary Forms presupposes Durkheim's initial intention to be understood; and to be understood it is clear that whatever additional intended acts Durkheim performed must have been in some sense conventional (Skinner 1970, 1972d).20 In a man- ner similar to that of Hawthorn (1976, p. 6), therefore, we would insist that the ideas within that work be seen "neither as disembodied abstrac- tions nor as the epiphenomenal and implicitly mechanical consequences of social conditions" but, rather, as themselves social actions and thus as necessarily defined by the conventions that rendered them meaningful and intelligible in the first place. The method therefore is to study Durkheim's contemporaries; to de- lineate the range of communications which could have been conventionally performed in writing the passages of the Elementary Forms; and then to locate these passages firmly within this larger pattern of discourse, thus assessing the relative plausibility of incompatible ascriptions of intention- ality (Skinner 1969, p. 49). By dealing with the context in this way, we avoid the difficulties of contextual explanation suggested above; for, in- stead of treating the context as the determinant of complex ideas, it is now employed as the ultimate framework for deciding what meanings, in a society of that kind, it might in principle have been possible for Durkheim to have intended to communicate (Skinner 1969, p. 49). By so doing, we also overcome the second difficulty of the infinite and ambiguous variety of potentially significant contextual "facts"; for the appeal to linguistic conventions enables us to "close the context" to a more limited range of potentially intended meanings (Dunn 1968, p. 98; Skinner 1974, p. 284). To illustrate such an approach, we might consider a case in which the linear-influence model has proved especially appealing-that of Durkheim, 20 More tediously, "The point is that any intention capable of being correctly under- stood by A as the intention intended by S to be understood by A must always be a socially conventional intention-must fall, that is, within a given and established range of acts which can be conventionally grasped as being cases of that intention. It must follow that one of the necessary conditions for understanding.in any situation what it is that S in uttering utterance X must be doing to A must be some under- standing of what it is that people in general, when behaving in a conventional manner, are usually doing in that society and in that situation in uttering such utterances" (Skinner 1970, p. 133). 297</page><page sequence="20">American Journal of Sociology Robertson Smith, and the Elementary Forms.21 This special appeal results at least partially from the fact that the relationship meets most of the cri- teria described earlier for establishing such "explanations." Lukes is quite right, for example, in pointing to the vacuous quality of Durkheim's early writings on religion, which grant that institution a largely negative, regula- tory function comparable to that of law and morality (Lukes 1972, p. 238). The important watershed thus seems to be the 1894-95 lecture course on religion at Bordeaux, where Durkheim apparently taught the works of Robertson Smith and his school; indeed, in a famous rejoinder to Simon Deploige, Durkheim himself later characterized this course as "pour moi une revelation" ([1907] 1923, p. 402).22 With the subsequent publication of the ethnographic investigations of Spencer and Gillen (1899, 1904), the writing of the Elementary Forms thus became a matter of "marry- ing a particular view of totemism to the growing mass of Australian material" (Lukes 1972, p. 244); and the influence of the latter, of course, is also acknowledged by Durkheim ([1902] 1969, p. 315; [1912] 1965, p. 110; 1913, pp. 326-27). By our own criterion of "privileged access," therefore, it could seem pointless to deny that Robertson Smith influenced Durkheim in some sense. But this of course has never been the question. Rather, we would merely suggest that, even if confirmed, the influence explains little beyond a few passages in the Elementary Forms; and even if it explained a great deal more, recognition that it did so would still not 21 The "substantive example" offered here is tentative and based upon incomplete research. For a much more authoritative illustration, see Skinner (1965-66, 1972a, 1972b; and also Schochet 1974, p. 262). Through some meticulous research into the writings of Hobbes's contemporaries, e.g., Skinner has discounted two standard as- sumptions about Hobbes's political theory: that it was unique and isolated and that it initially met only intense opposition from its audience (see Trevor-Roper 1957; Gooch 1915; Mintz 1962). Having established this context, Skinner then maintains that the view of Hobbes's intellectual relations necessarily implied by the "deonto- logical" interpretation of Hobbes (e.g., Warrender 1957; Hood 1964) would be his- torically absurd, in that it implies that (1) every contemporary, whether follower or opponent, missed this point in Hobbes's theory; (2) every contemporary was mis- taken in precisely the same way; and (3), despite this, Hobbes never bothered to inform them of their error. (For Skinner's more historically credible interpretation of Hobbes, see 1972a, pp. 96-98.) 22 Even here, however, the evidence is not unambiguous, at least insofar as this en- counter is taken in its more apocalyptic form. First, the "revelation" in question refers, if we are to be textually precise, to Durkheim's discovery of, "en cette annee . . .. pour la premiere fois . . . le moyen d'aborder sociologiquement l'etude de la religion." Smith is referred to more specifically in order to deny the influence of Wundt. Second, Durkheim was citing Smith's work as early as the Division of Labor ([1893] 1933, pp. 59, n. 15; 208, n. 9); and, considering the fact that the "revelation" presumably con- cerned Smith's "communion" theory of sacrifice, it is surprising that in Durkheim's discussion of human sacrifice as an example of altruistic suicide (1897, pp. 220-28) Smith is not cited at all (see also the evidence below). Unfortunately, even Lukes (1972, p. 238) was unable to recover an extant account of the 1894-95 course at Bor- deaux. 298</page><page sequence="21">Understanding a Sociological Classic be equivalent to an understanding of Durkheim's action in writing this classic work. To illustrate this point, we will reexamine this important relationship with two, quite different, questions in mind. First, what were the conventions governing the treatment of the issues with which the Religion of the Semites and the Elementary Forms were mutually con- cerned? And second, within this larger pattern of discourse, what was Durkheim doing-in other words, what were his intentions? The first step is to establish Smith's role in relation to his own intel- lectual contemporaries. Here one can only endorse Beidelman's judgment that "few if any would claim that Smith, despite his fantastic erudition and controversial celebrity, was a genuine innovator in the fields of biblical or Semitic literary studies; rather, he introduced and popularized in Britain revolutionary interpretations in these fields already formulated by Conti- nental scholars, especially in Germany and Holland" (1974, pp. xi-xii). The origins of this Continental biblical criticism lay in the more anti- religious writings of Ferdinand C. Bauer and David F. Strauss, who, under the impetus of the new "scientific" history, insisted that Scripture be subject to the same methods of historical criticism then applied to any other body of texts. This insistence was quickly felt in the writings of the German scholars Vatke, Graf, Reuss, Ritschl, and N6ldeke as well as in those of Wilken (Holland) and Goldziher (Hungary); but it received an especially significant application in the work of the Dutch biblical scholar Abraham Kuenen and the German Semiticist Julius Wellhausen. Much of this work was known in England through the translation of Strauss by George Eliot and the later writings of MacKay (1850), Mar- tineau (1853), and Bishop Colenso (1862; also see Vickery 1973, pp. 16- 17); but Smith, who traveled frequently on the Continent and whose linguistic skills were legendary, knew it in the original (Beidelman 1974, p. 12). In general, these "Higher Critics" stressed the mastery of a culture as a totality and in its own terms rather than as fragments distorted through the lens of modern preconceptions; more specifically, however, this principle led to a reordering of the books of the Pentateuch and con- comitantly to a revolutionary interpretation of the original meaning of sacrifice. The significance of the latter, in particular, must not be under- estimated. First, Smith himself was later to urge that "the origin and meaning of sacrifice constitutes the central problem of ancient religion . . ." ([1889] 1927, p. 27), a judgment to receive the general consent of Loisy (1920, p. 1), Evans-Pritchard (1964, pp. vii-viii), and Beidelman (1974, p. 53). Second, the dominant theory of the meaning of that ritual had remained relatively constant since Plato's Euthyphro in which, in addi- tion to assuming that the rite was the symbolic expression of the relation between the gods and men ("piety"), Socrates had suggested that sacrifice 299</page><page sequence="22">American Journal of Sociology was a kind of "gift" and also posed (though did not resolve) the disturb- ing and contradictory corollary to this interpretation-that the gods were in some sense dependent on mortals for their sustenance. A somewhat dif- ferent theory, which purported to resolve this contradiction, was advanced by Sallustius during the Julianic reaction of the 4th century A.D. (Nock 1926); and Arthur Sykes's Essay on the Nature, Design, and Origin of Sacrifice (1748, pp. 73-74) at least hinted that the ritual involved a meal taken in fellowship with the god. But neither view seriously challenged the gift theory of sacrifice, and in both the anonymous Encyclopaedia Bri- tannica entry of 1859 (8th ed.) and Tylor's Primitive Culture ([1871] 1958) the prevailing notion is that of a gift designed to please or placate an all-powerful god. Third and finally, the opposition to this view pre- sented by Wellhausen (1878) and Smith ([1889] 1927) was sufficient to inspire a major scientific and theological controversy, the most notable consequences of which include Frazer's Golden Bough ([1890] 1922), Hubert and Mauss's "Essai sur la nature et la fonction du sacrifice" ([1909] 1929), Freud's "Totem and Tabu" (1912), and of course the Elementary Forms itself. To understand the nature of this controversy, it is necessary to recall certain features of the Old Testament. Of the four "Codes" of legislation which appear in the Pentateuch, the Priestly Code (found in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers) provides by far the most complete account of ceremonialism, cult, and ritual-and thus of sacrifice; it therefore became the interpretive key for disclosing other less clear and complete references to early Hebraic ritual. The so-called Grafian hypothesis of the Higher Critics thus initiated a major controversy, for it suggested that the Priestly Code was actually the most recent of the four Codes and that it had been written only after the Hebrews returned from the Babylonian Exile of 586-536 B.C. (most biblical scholars now date the Priestly Code ca. 400 B.C.). Despite the arguments of Vatke, Graf, and Kuenen, however, this view made little headway until Wellhausen's Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels (1878) brought the majority of biblical scholars to the side of the Higher Critics (Finkelstein 1935, p. 400). In Wellhausen's Prolegomena, however, this view was conjoined with another, still more controversial argument-a major reinterpretation of the original nature of Hebrew sacrifice: ". . . The Priestly Code alone," Wellhausen argued, "occupies itself much with the subject of sacrifice; it alone gives a minute classification of the various kinds of offerings and a description of the procedure to be followed in the case of each; and thus it alone furnishes the normative scheme for modern accounts of sacri- fice, into which all other casual notices of the Old Testament have been made to fit as best they can" (1878, p. 52). Wellhausen further insisted 300</page><page sequence="23">Understanding a Sociological Classic that such anachronistic reconstructions be dismissed in favor of a more historically accurate rendering of the early Hebrew ritual; he thus at- tempted to reconstruct the true character of primitive sacrifice on the scant foundation of the pre-Exilic evidence-for example, the 8th- and 7th-century prophets and the Deuteronomic Code (621 B.C.; found in Deut. 12:28). Wellhausen's theory eventually divided the history of Hebrew sacrifice into three stages. In the earliest period (before 621 B.C.), worship was a natural and intimate part of daily life, and the Hebrews were more concerned with the acceptability of their sacrifices than with the specific mechanics of sacrificial ritual. There were only two types of sacrifice, the holocaust and the communion-sacrifice; the latter was more common and consisted of intimate, joyous meals shared by family, friends, and gods on such occasions as harvest, shearing, vintage, and war. Most important, there was no clear distinction between sacred and secular practice (p. 76). The second period began with the Deuteronomic Reform of the reign of Josias (621 B.C.), which abolished all sacrifice outside the Temple at Jerusalem and thus centralized, unified, and eventually systematized the ritual. Most important, Deuteronomic Law sanctioned profane slaugh- tering and formally recognized the distinction between the secular family feast and sacred worship in the Temple; the disjunction between sacred and secular was thus created (p. 77). The third period began with the Exile (586-536 B.C.), and its primary feature was a passionate concern for the mechanics of ritual. That concern is already present in Ezekiel's (ca. 593-586 B.C.) description of the rites to be followed upon the restoration of the cult and, most important, his emphasis upon the idea of expiation. In accord with the latter, two new forms of sacrifice not mentioned in any earlier text are introduced: the sacrifices for sin and for reparation. These emphases were embodied in the laws of the Priestly Code, which were followed until the Roman destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70) effec- tively rendered Hebrew sacrifice impossible (p. 80). Although the Higher Critics' reordering of the books of the Penta- teuch was to outlast by far Wellhausen's theory of sacrifice in the eyes of most scholars, Smith accepted both; his own view of primitive sacrifice as a communal meal appeared as early as the Old Testament in the Jewish Church ([1881] 1892) and more fully in his Encyclopaedia Britannica article on "sacrifice" in 1886. Simultaneously, however, Smith connected this view of the earliest stage of Hebrew sacrifice with totemism. The "totemic hypothesis"-that the earliest societies consisted of homoge- neous "stock groups," that there was some mystical connection among the groups, and that each claimed a kindred animal or plant as the symbol of its unity-had been advanced by Smith's friend J. F. McLennan in 301</page><page sequence="24">American Journal of Sociology 1867 and again in 1869-70. Smith himself attached this interpretation to the ancient Semites in "Animal Worship and Animal Tribes among the Ancient Arabs and in the Old Testament" (1880); and, while these views received the initial support of Continental biblical scholars (e.g., Well- hausen, Goldziher, and especially Noldeke), they contributed substan- tially to Smith's suspension and eventual dismissal from the Free Church Divinity College of the University of Aberdeen.23 By far the most complete statement of these views, however, appears later in Smith's classic Lectures on the Religion of the Semites ([1889] 1927). The Lectures contain a number of arguments important in the subse- quent scientific study of religion: the view that ritual practice is both analytically and chronologically prior to mythological belief and that the former should thus occupy the initial attentions of the scholar (pp. 17- 18); that in primitive societies, religious and political institutions were but different aspects of the same social customs (pp. 21-22); that the earliest socioreligious groups constituted a natural society rather than one established by covenant and that both social and religious duties were thus established at birth (pp. 29, 319); that men were thus born into fixed relations with their gods as they were with one another and that these relations were those of kinship (pp. 30-44, 273-74); the essentially positive view of religious rites (offered explicitly in opposition to Renan), which insists that religious acts, as opposed to magic, are not performed out of fear or in the interest of conciliation (pp. 54-55); the argument that the gods are defined not by their inherent character but through their relations with men and that these relations were explicitly of an occasion- al, intermittent, and completely nonauthoritarian kind (pp. 60-61); and so on. The last six of the 11 lectures, however, are explicitly concerned with the problem of the meaning of sacrifice. Smith's argument here is far more complex than Wellhausen's, but the two are certainly similar. Like Wellhausen, for example, Smith regards the Priestly Code as late and potentially misleading; but Smith goes on to insist that the entire Penta- teuch represents a "reshaping and remodelling of more ancient institutions . . . common not only to Hebrews but to their heathen neighbors as well" (pp. 3, 216). The similarity of Hebrew and heathen practice here is sup- ported by racial as well as biblical argument (pp. 4-5); and it permits Smith free and extensive (if unconvincing) use of the single reported case of an apparent totemic sacrifice among the Semites, the sacrifice of a camel by Arab Saracens in the 4th century A.D., reported by Nilus in Nili opera quaxdam nondum edita (Paris 1639, p. 27). It is on the foundation of this single case, together with a free use of the evolutionary "method 23 For an excellent account of the Aberdeen heresy, which forced Smith's suspension and eventual dismissal from the Free Church College, see Beidelman (1974, pp. 13-22). 302</page><page sequence="25">Understanding a Sociological Classic of survivals,"24 that Smith reconstructs the history of sacrifice among the Semites. In the earliest times, he insists, every sacrifice was a feast and every feast a sacrifice: The identity of religious occasions and festal seasons may indeed be taken as the determining characteristic of the type of ancient religion generalfy; when men meet their god they feast and are glad together, and whenever they feast and are glad they desire that the god should be of the party. This view is proper to religions in which the habitual temper of the wor- shippers is one of joyous confidence in their god, untroubled by any habitu- al sense of human guilt, and resting on the firm conviction that they and the deity they adore are good friends, who understand each other perfectly and are united by bonds not easily broken. [P. 255] Since this religious community was construed as a physical unity, any attenuation of its bonds could be rectified through a physical process. When famine, plague, or other disasters beset the Hebrews, therefore, they assumed that the bond of kinship had become relaxed, and they attempted to restore it through the sacramental spilling of the blood of a theantropic animal. This ritual, of which Nilus's camel was believed to be a "survival," thus contained the germ of the ethical idea of atone- ment (pp. 319-20). Still later, in a manner which should interest the sociologist of knowledge, Smith accounts for the further development of this "more uncertain" religion and the eventual breakdown of the "com- mon good understanding" as the consequence of the series of political disasters which culminated in the Babylonian Exile (p. 258). Only when God thus appeared to have withdrawn from them, therefore, did the Hebrews resort to piacula and holocaust as the means to atone for their presumed sin; and this, Smith suggests, explains why such expiatory sacri- fices are not mentioned until Ezekiel (p. 217) and receive a concise de- scription only in the portions of the Priestly Code found in Leviticus (pp. 238-39). Smith also addresses the issues raised by Socrates and Tylor. The notion that the gods receive physical satisfaction from the sacrifices of mortals is "admittedly crass," he suggests, but as long as sacrifice remained a predominantly social service, performed by the whole community, the idea of religious fellowship supported it. The "scandal" (which was to afford Durkheim so much interest) emerged with the evolution of private sacrifice and, more important, of the concept of private property; though necessary to human progress, Smith argues, these developments quickly reduced the rite to materialistic bargaining for divine favor. Unlike Tylor, 24 For an excellent discussion of the "method of survivals," see Hodgen (1936). The use of this method, which was developed by Tylor and was also used by Durkheim, led Evans-Pritchard (1965, p. 52) to conclude that "all Robertson Smith really does is to guess about a period of Semitic history about which we know almost nothing." 303</page><page sequence="26">American Journal of Sociology however, Smith regards this commercial concept of sacrifice as a later development, holding no role whatever in the original meaning of the rite (pp. 392-96). Smith was hardly unaware of the implications of his theory of sacrifice for the Christian church. Once again as the consequence of their own preconceptions, Smith concludes, Christian theologians have regarded an- cient Semitic sacrifices as "a type of sacrifice on the cross"; moreover, since they interpret the latter as a substitutionary sacrifice of Christ for the purpose of satisfying divine justice, they have grossly overestimated the ethical lessons of the Jewish sacrificial system (p. 425). In ancient sacrifice, Smith insists, the various ethical conceptions which surround the Crucifixion-redemption, substitution, purification, atoning blood, the gar- ment of righteousness (i.e., the sacred victim's skin), etc.-are but vague impressions; and . . .the attempt to find in them anything as precise and definite as the notions attached to the same words by Christian theologians is altogether illegitimate. The one point that comes out clear and strong is that the fundamental idea of ancient sacrifice is sacramental communion, and that all atoning rites are ultimately to be regarded as owing their efficacy to a communication of divine life to the worshippers, and to the establishment or confirmation of a living bond between them and their god. In primitive ritual this conception is grasped in a merely physical and mechanical shape. ... [P. 439] This "revision" of the Pauline interpretation of the Eucharist was not the primary issue in the "Aberdeen heresy," but at least one astute Pres- byterian minister felt that it should have been (see Black and Chrystal 1912, p. 417); and later scholars have been inclined to agree (Cook 1927, p. xxvii, n. 2; Thompson 1963, p. xi; Beidelman 1974, p. 54, n. 93). For, as Frazer was to observe in his eulogy of his former master ([1894] 1927, p. 288), Smith had shown that the doctrine of the atonement of Christ and the sacrament of the Eucharist are each found in a crudely materialistic and mechanical form in pagan and even savage religions. How were such "analogies" to be explained? Smith's answer, which embodies appeals to the conventions of both Victorian anthropology and Christian notions of gradual enlightenment and moral perfectibility,25 was the following: That the God-man dies for His people, and that His death is their life, is an idea which was in some degree foreshadowed by the oldest mystical 25 The excesses perpetrated under the sway of Victorian anthropological notions, both by Smith and by others, are well known. One of the special virtues of Beidelman (1974), however, is his suggestion that such conceptions were frequently conjoined with Christian doctrines of gradual enlightenment; thus Smith "saw Jews as gradually evolving from a period of ignorance about God's plans for them through ever higher forms of moral awareness, with Christian revelation representing the evolutionary peak" (1974, p. 38). 304</page><page sequence="27">Understanding a Sociological Classic sacrifices. It was foreshadowed, indeed in a very crude and materialistic form, and without any of those ethical ideas which the Christian doctrine of the Atonement derives from a profounder sense of sin and divine justice. And yet the voluntary death of the divine victim, which we have seen to be a conception not foreign to ancient sacrificial ritual, contained the germ of the deepest thought in the Christian doctrine; the thought that the Re- deemer gives Himself for His people, that "for their sakes He consecrates Himself, that they also might be consecrated in truth." [(1889) 1927, p. 393, quoted in Frazer (1894) 1927, p. 289] While Smith was thus convinced that his views were not heretical, Evans- Pritchard is undoubtedly correct in suggesting that, for a Presbyterian minister, this was getting "rather near the bone" (1965, p. 52). It is at least worth noting (as the increasingly skeptical Frazer did), there- fore, that this passage was deleted from the revised and otherwise ex- panded second edition of the Lectures (Frazer [1894] 1927) .26 The controversy inspired by the publication of Smith's Lectures, there- fore, was simultaneously scientific and theological; and the relation be- tween the two aspects, if they can be analytically separated at all, is a fascinating question for the sociology of knowledge. While the depth and complexity of the controversy literally defy quick summary, for example, such a summary would at least include a discussion of Smith's two major supporters-Jevons ([1896] 1911) and Reinach (1900, 1908a, 1908b, 1912, 1923, 1928)-though neither proved convincing, and both suffered in his defense; the lengthy refutation of Wellhausen's earlier theory of sacrifice by Baxter (1896); the immediate and continuous denunciation of Smith's extensive reliance upon the "trop isole"' case of Nilus (La- grange 1905, p. 258; see also Sayce 1889; Jacobs [1890] 1894, pp. 32- 34; Higgens 1893, p. 31; and Hubert and Mauss [1909] 1929, p. iv); the rejection of Smith's evolutionary reconstruction of the history of sacri- fice, as based on the method of survivals (Goldenweiser 1910, p. 263, n. 5; see also Hubert and Mauss [1909] 1929, p. xi); the denial of Smith's discovery of totemism and dismissal of gift-sacrifice among the earliest Hebrews, first expressed in Jacobs's (1889) critique of Smith's "Animal Worship" and later in Jacobs (1894, pp. 32-34), Goblet d'Alviella (1898, pp. 510 ff.), and Gayford (1924, pp. 14-16); and especially Marillier's (1897-98) observation that, if the bond was in fact kinship, its periodic revivification would be unnecessary and, if it was not, then totemism was not the origin of the ritual. Virtually all of these criticisms have received the support of later scholars (e.g., James 1927, pp. 3-4; [1933] 1971, 26 It should be noted that Smith's most recent biographer (Beidelman 1974, p. 26, n. 38) defends him against any charges of expediency or pusillanimity. Such an altera- tion under fire would certainly be inconsistent with the previous evidence of Smith's unyielding adherence to scholarly principle in the face of intense pressure. The issue will undoubtedly remain unresolved until Smith's papers and correspondence are made more widely available. 305</page><page sequence="28">American Journal of Sociology pp. 33-34; Evans-Pritchard 1954, p. 22; Chelhod 1955, pp. 17-18; de Vaux 1961, 1:448-49; Thompson 1963, pp. 11-12; and most recently Beidelman 1974, pp. 42-43, 54-55). Within this context, two cases are of special interest to the student of Durkheim. The first, Hubert and Mauss's 1898 Essai sur la nature et la fonction du sacrifice ([1909] 1929), represents the effort to establish a quite different theory of sacrifice, independent of the conception of the "naturally sacred victim" and thus of totemism. The highly formal and abstract definition there proposed-that sacrifice is "a religious act which, through the consecration of a victim, modifies the condition of the moral person who accomplishes it or that of certain objects with which he is concerned" (p. 13; emphasis in original)-stresses the "communicative" (rather than "communion") aspect of the rite and bears a closer simi- larity to the views of Sallustius (see above, and Evans-Pritchard 1954, pp. 23-25) and Levi-Strauss (1966, pp. 223-28; see also Evans-Pritchard 1965, pp. 70-71) than to those of either Smith or Durkheim. The second case-Frazer's early acceptance of and then rapid retreat from his master's theories-illustrates the pivotal significance of the Aus- tralian evidence and particularly the Arunta intichiuma. As Frazer himself acknowledged in the preface to the first edition of the Golden Bough (1890), the central idea of that work-the conception of the slain god- was derived directly from Smith's theory of sacrifice ([1890] 1922, p. xiv). At Smith's death, however, Frazer already had doubts concerning the totemic origin of that rite ([1894] 1927, p. 288); and, with the publi- cation of Spencer and Gillen's Native Tribes of Central Australia (1899), these doubts blossomed into full rejection. For Spencer and Gillen had reported (pp. 167-68) and eventually repeated (1904, p. 283) that the primary ritual activity of the Arunta was a ceremony of cooperative magic designed to increase and maintain an adequate food supply. Frazer thus revised his earlier estimate by (1) placing magic before religion in evo- lutionary sequence; (2) placing the totem sacrament later in religious development; and (3), in a classic case of "selective amnesia," denying that he had ever assented to Smith's earlier theory in the first place (1899a, 1899b, 1900; see also Ackerman 1975, pp. 125, 129-30). Frazer's revised estimate of the magical significance of the Arunta rites was sup- ported by Cook (1902, pp. 438-39) and Goldenweiser (1916, p. 954); moreover, it was developed in direct correspondence with Baldwin Spencer himself. Considering Durkheim's continuing insistence that the intichiuma was far more than a "simple magic operation" (1912, p. 384), therefore, it is not surprising that Spencer and Gillen found the praise of their work in Sur le tote'misme (Durkheim [1902] 1969) a mixed blessing. On the system of clan organization, Spencer wrote to Frazer on July 24, 1903, 306</page><page sequence="29">Understanding a Sociological Classic Durkheim "is quite astray, as he is on many other points. It appears to be most difficult to write an account like ours without conveying a wrong idea. . . His whole article is full of misconceptions ..." (quoted in Marett and Penniman 1932, pp. 84-85).27 The "marriage" properly re- ferred to by Lukes (see above, and 1972, p. 244) thus seems to have been between a largely discredited theory of totemism and a somewhat mis- conceived mass of Australian material. But what was Durkheim doing? As part of an initial, tentative answer, one might focus on those aspects of Smith's work which may have proved compellingly attractive despite the questionable validity of Smith's theo- ries-his group-centered, positive conception of religious institutions; the emphasis on ritual over belief; his Presbyterian rationalism which, like Durkheim's Judaic rationalism, was inherently opposed to Catholic mys- tiCiSM;28 his conception of the nature of the early Hebrew religious com- munity, which may have provided an almost ideal representation of the tenuous, intermittent, secular ties of Durkheim's Third Republic; and so on. While such potential attractions may go unchallenged, however, we have already (see n. 22 above) had reason to question the apocalyp- tic significance of Smith's vision to Durkheim's work; and this suspicion is supported by Durkheim's "De la definition des phenomenes religieux" ([1899] 1975, p. 80), which maintains, in opposition to a superordinate conception of the deity, that the relationship between the god and his worshippers is of a contractual, interdependent kind and expressed through a propitiatory gift, following the sacrificial principle of do ut des. Smith is not mentioned at all here, and the supportive evidence, as in much of Durkheim's early sociology of religion, comes from the nonanthropo- morphic religions of India such as the Vedic religions, Brahmanism, and Jainism. The first appreciation of Smith's communion theory of sacrifice appears only in 1902, and the even more crucial connection of this with "periodicity" appears in 1907-a fact which suggests that Durkheim was less impressed with Smith's theory than with the possibility of forging it to the recently published Australian evidence. In establishing this relationship, Durkheim notes what "a revolution" Smith had produced in the traditional gift theory of sacrifice: "Its es- sential element is no longer the act of renunciation which the word sacri- fice ordinarily expresses; before all, it is an act of alimentary communion" (Durkheim [1912] 1965, p. 378). Durkheim's single reservation here concerns the efficacy of the rite, which he attributes more to the "sacred" 27 For additional and surprisingly infrequently cited criticisms of Durkheim's treat- ment of the Australian evidence, see Spencer and Gillen (1904, p. 121, n. 1), Van Gennep (1913), Stanner (1967), and Levi-Strauss (1966, pp. 223-28). 28 See, e.g., the point raised in Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1958, p. 125). 307</page><page sequence="30">American Journal of Sociology quality of the food than to the act of communion itself;29 this point had been stressed by Hubert and Mauss much earlier ([1909] 1929), but for Durkheim it is the consequence not of consecration but of the natural sacredness of the animal (thus connecting the rite to totemism). And this sacredness derives from the common possession of the "totemic principle," a transmutation of Codrington's mana (1891) which, like all elements of nature, requires periodic revivification. The intichiuma was thus anal- ogous to the agrarian rites of the European peasantry described by Wil- helm Mannhardt (1831-80) and given prominence in Frazer's Golden Bough (though Durkheim, of course, was to grant them a religious rather than a purely magical significance [(1912) 1965, p. 380]). It was thus on the natural aspect of the victim's sacredness which Durkheim placed so much stress: "Sacrifice was not founded to create a bond of artificial kinship between a man and his gods, but to maintain and renew the natural kinship which primitively united them. Here, as elsewhere, the artifice was born only to imitate nature" ([1912] 1965, p. 381; see also Smith [1889] 1927, pp. 318-19). This clearly distin- guishes Durkheim from the Durkheimians Hubert and Mauss; and, de- spite Durkheim's tacit endorsement of his followers' justifiable reser- vations concerning Nilus ([1912] 1965, p. 381, n. 45; see also Hubert and Mauss [1909] 1929, p. v), it firmly attaches him to Smith's conception of a totemic sacrifice. Ultimately, however, Durkheim was forced to depart from Smith, and in so doing he contrived one of the most original and important arguments of the Elementary Forms itself. As we have seen, Smith maintained that communion was not just an essential element in sacrifice but literally its only significance; the notion of an expiatory oblation or offering is merely a later corruption of this original meaning and presupposes both the materialistic conception of private property and the conception of the god as a "prince" or "proprietor" to whom tribute is due. Most important Smith resorts to this evolutionary reconstruction to account for the ap- parent "absurdity" noted by Socrates-that a deity whose functions in- cluded the divine providence for the needs of his worshippers would in turn require offerings of food from these same mortals. Such an "appeal to evolution to save a hypothesis" was hardly repug- nant to Durkheim, for it was a technique he frequently used himself (Lukes 1972, p. 454); but in this case it was unnecessary, for, as we shall see, Durkheim felt he had a better solution. First, he observes, Smith's evolutionary reconstruction is at odds with the Australian evi- dence: the intichiuma is surely very primitive and thus precedes the con- 29 This appears to be slightly unfair to Smith, who granted considerable importance to the sacred blood of the sacrificial victim. 308</page><page sequence="31">Understanding a Sociological Classic ception of private property; the forces it exerts are purely impersonal and involve no conception of an anthropomorphic "proprietor," and yet the notion of periodic revivification here in evidence involves precisely the "absurd" notion of reciprocal interdependence between god and worship- ers which, according to Smith, is implied in the notion of sacrificial tribute (Durkheim [1912] 1965, p. 383). Durkheim thus adopts the more "synthetic" view30 that primitive sacrifice involves both expiatory obla- tion and communion; and while this rejection of Smith openly assumes the very point which still requires considerable argument-that the Arunta intichiuma possesses any truly "religious," as opposed to "magi- cal," significance whatever-it does yeoman service in Durkheim's final conclusions. For, having rejected Smith's evolutionary solution, Durkheim must now explain the apparent contradiction of divine interdependence himself. At the symbolic level, Durkheim begins, the identification of sacredness with natural phenomena implies that the former will be as bound to the sea- sonal rhythm of decay and rebirth as are the latter; second, this seasonal, physical variation is reflected in the mental (i.e., social) life of human beings, whose feeling of communal solidarity increases with assembly and decreases with individual isolation. This also accounts for the efficacy of the rite and thus its endurance, for men "find the solution" merely by assembling to look for it. In this sense, therefore, it is quite accurate to say that the gods are dependent upon mortals for their sustenance (Durkheim [1912] 1965, p. 388). Moreover, when these symbolic repre- sentations are replaced by the real things for which they stand, the Kant- ian foundation for this argument becomes clear. In a manner isomorphic with Kant's distinction between the sensible and intelligible worlds, there- fore, Durkheim insists, On the one hand, the individual gets from society the best part of him- self, all that gives him a distinct character and a special place among other beings, his intellectual and moral culture. If we should withdraw from men their language, sciences, arts and moral beliefs, they would drop to the rank of animals. So the characteristic attributes of human nature come from society. But on the other hand, society exists and lives only in and through individuals. If the idea of society were extinguished in individual minds and the beliefs, traditions and aspirations of the group were no longer felt and shared by the individuals, society would die. We can say of it what we just said of the divinity; it is real only in so far as it has a place in human consciousnesses, and this place is whatever one may give it. We now see the real reason why the gods cannot do without their wor- 30 More synthetic interpretations of the meaning of primitive sacrifice were rapidly becoming conventional in the face of the evidence and argument against Smith. See, e.g., the theories of Lagrange (1905, p. 266), Loisy (1909, pp. 40-41; 1920, pp. 5-7), Gayford (1924), Gray (1925), Oesterley (1937), Gusdorf (1948), Rodinson (1956), Thompson (1963), and de Vaux (1961, 1:451-54; 1964, p. 37). 309</page><page sequence="32">American Journal of Sociology shippers any more than these can do without their gods; it is because society, of which the gods are only a symbolic expression, cannot do with- out individuals any more than these can do without society. [Pp. 388-89] Durkheim's attraction for such Kantian dualisms, of course, has not gone unobserved; nor was it particularly exceptional, at least on the evidence of Bougle's suggestion that, in Parisian intellectual circles after 1870, such interests were altogether conventional (1938, pp. 52-53). What is unique (and, I would argue, altogether ingenious) is Durkheim's manipu- lation of this major religious and scientific controversy over Smith's theory (which he did not entirely accept) through its application to the Aus- tralian ethnographic evidence (for which it could not account) into a full-scale Kantian interpretation of the relation between the individual and society. The hostile critic, of course, will point to the admittedly incomplete and tentative nature of this interpretation. Against this, I would simply suggest that it is offered in response to the request for a more substan- tive example of a methodological argument that is itself quite abstract. But, whatever the final conclusions of such an investigation, it should be clear that unlike the anachronisms cited earlier these meanings were at least available to Durkheim, and there is substantial textual warrant to suggest that he intended them. CONCLUSION One last objection yet remains: that the approach is "scholastic" and that when work utilizing it is done little will remain beyond the "dust of scholarship." This objection seems to gain strength from the obviously mistaken view that a more rigorous method necessarily implies more triv- ial results. But it also rests upon the assumption that whatever results are forthcoming will be "merely historical," that is, of no interest to sociology. This assumption invites several observations on the relation between history and sociology. First, it cannot be assumed (and least of all by a sociologist!) that the question of "what Durkheim's theory is" can be regarded as prior to or separate from the question of his intellectual relations. For any inter- pretation of any classic writer's work necessarily implies some connections between that writer and his contemporaries; and in the sense indicated above, if the particular interpretation is to "work," the connections thus implied must be of a historically possible and credible kind. Second, a similar principle applies to our interpretations of contempo- rary sociological theory, a fact which undoubtedly accounts for (though by no means justifies) the mythological practices described by Gouldner 310</page><page sequence="33">Understanding a Sociological Classic (see above, and 1958, p. 12, n. 5). Thus any claim for or criticism of a contemporary theoretical perspective necessarily implies certain things about its past; and of course, if the particular historical connections thus implied are not credible, that fact would seem to diminish the credibility of the claim or criticism itself accordingly. One can only look forward to the day when such extended historical investigations designed to unveil the "absolute presuppositions"31 of such perspectives replace the mytho- logical reconstructions contrived to legitimate them. In the last analysis, however, the primary function of an authentic history of sociological theory, as both Kuhn and Popper affirm, is to help us understand the manner in which our knowledge progresses (Kuhn 1970, pp. 1-19). It is here that the objection to the "merely historical" appears strongest, and in two distinct forms. The first and more extreme version suggests that sociologists need be concerned only with the logical structure of the products of their scientific activity and not with the nature of that activity itself. This view would certainly offend a substan- tial number in the discipline, for example, those in the sociology of knowl- edge and science; and it would also ignore a major heuristic resource for the construction of contemporary theory. For surely it is curious that, at the same time that modern sociologists struggle to expand their imagi- nations and thus to develop new ideas to account for the complexities of human behavior, there is nothing of which we are more ignorant than the nature of the process by which such ideas emerge, are received, grow, change, and are eventually surpassed. And in overcoming this lamentable ignorance, "mere" history is not one answer-it is the only answer. This raises the second form of the objection: that, while such a history of sociological thought might thus be interesting and even important to contemporary sociological theory, it should be written by professionally trained historians rather than by sociologists themselves. For anyone conversant with the literature in the history of sociological thought, this proposal has undeniable attractions. The difficulty is that it is so blatantly counterfactual. The problem is not simply that most "histories" of the- ory are written by sociologists; the problem is that, as Merton has ob- served, "almost all sociologists see themselves as qualified to teach and to write the history of sociological theory" (1967, p. 2; emphasis added). And the great irony here, as Merton goes on to argue, is that in doing so sociologists write history in the most asociological manner.32 Indeed, at the very time when professional historians are using sociological theories and methods in their own research to an unprecedented degree, most "histories of sociological thought" bear a closer methodological (if not 31 The phrase, of course, is Collingwood's ([19401 1972). 32 Noteworthy exceptions include Lukes (1972) and Coser (1971). 311</page><page sequence="34">American Journal of Sociology stylistic) resemblance to the writings of Carlyle than to those of the modern social science historian. The need to follow Merton's injunction, therefore, has never been more clear or the means to do so more present-we surely need a sociological history of sociological thought. Having made this commitment, however, I would also endorse the caveat recently entered by Collini (1977), that ". . . while it is certainly the case that our explanations must be 'social' in the sense in which the contrast is 'individual'-we must, that is, go beyond the text itself and that necessarily involves reference to 'social facts'-that is no reason to concentrate on the 'social' in the sense in which the contrast is 'intellectual.' Ideas, beliefs, values, or language are just as much social facts as economic development or class structure...." REFERENCES Ackerman, R. 1975. "Frazer on Myth and Ritual."
