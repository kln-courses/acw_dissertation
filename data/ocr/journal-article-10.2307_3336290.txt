<plain_text><page sequence="1">BONO BRASS CASTING RAYMOND A. SILVERMAN One of the best-documented traditional technologies of West Africa is the cire perdue or lost-wax metal-casting process of the Akan of Ghana. It has been used to produce a variety of objects in gold, silver, and brass (metals associated with commerce and status in Akan society), such as chiefly regalia, geometric and figurative goldweights, and the elegant, lidded containers called kuduo. As early as 1817, Thomas Bowdich (1966:311-12) commis- sioned the casting of some small gold objects and documented the process, providing us with the first published description of the technique. A little more than 100 years later the British ethnographer R.S. Rattray recorded in greater detail the cast- ing of brass goldweights in the Bono town of Takyiman (1923:306-8), and bells and kuduo in the Asante town of Bekwai (1927:309-16). The fullest accounts are recent ones by Menzel (1968:22-35), Garrard (1980a:119-22), and McLeod (1981:80-82). With the exception of Rattray's notes on Takyiman goldweight casting, all describe the process as practiced in or near Kumase. Admittedly, it is virtually the same throughout the Akan region. Nevertheless, there are subtle differences in pro- cedure and vocabulary that may at some future date yield fresh insights into the evolution of this art. The following de- scription of brass casting among the Bono and the discussion of oral traditions associated with it are presented as a contribu- tion to the growing body of information about Akan cire perdue technology. The thousands of kuduo and millions of goldweights main- tained in museum and private collections testify to the impor- tance of lost-wax casting in the art history of the Akan. How- ever, the industry has atrophied over the last century. Rattray was aware of this situation sixty years ago when he wrote: "The art of metal-work (i.e. in connexion with brass castings) is no longer taught, and would have been extinct altogether had it not survived in the goldsmith's trade, which is still in a fairly flourishing condition and employs somewhat parallel methods" (Rattray 1927:310-11). Today, the cire perdue process continues to survive primarily in the production of gold objects;2 those artisans who spe- cialize in the casting of brass have all but disappeared from most parts of the Akan region. Unlike goldwork, brass objects (i.e., gold-weighing equipment and kuduo) are no longer in demand there. The only market for them is the tourist trade, and most brass production seems to be concentrated in a sin- gle Asante village, Kurofofurom, located a few kilometers from Kumase. To be sure, the odd brasscaster can still be found in villages outside the Kumase area, but he is usually an aged man who has ceased practicing the trade. Such is the case in the northern Akan region, where a single man living in the village of Buoyem, ten kilometers north of Takyiman, appears to be the last traditional brass caster among the Takyiman-Bono. When I met Osei Kojo in 1980 (Fig. 13), he was 80 years old and had not cast for over ten years.3 Kojo recalled that up to roughly twenty years ago there was an adequate demand for his manufactures. But a shrinking mar- ket, primarily due to the presence of less expensive (and often more prestigious) imported goods, finally led to the decision to abandon casting and devote all of his time to farming and hunting. None of Osei Kojo's children, nor anyone else in Buoyem, has expressed an interest in learning the art. In February, 1980, I asked Osei Kojo to demonstrate the process so that it might be recorded on film. Aware that he was the last cire perdue specialist in the area and that it was important to document this ancient art, he agreed to come out of retirement.4 First Kojo asked me to help him obtain some new tools that were difficult to find in Ghana in 1980. We went to Bonduku in Ivory Coast for two kinds of pliers (for cutting and gripping), two files (one round, the other flat) and two yards of white muslin. Finally, toward the middle of April, Kojo began to make preparations for the casting of several types of brass objects, namely, crotals (atinkaa or adTimma), small silent crotals (nndnndmma), finger rings (kawa), openwork necklace beads (bomofrana), and solid necklace beads (fotoba). The first stage involved preparing a mixture of clay and charcoal to be used in making the cores for the crotals. Char- coal (bidie) was placed in a mortar, broken into small pieces, and then transferred to a grinding stone (oboba) where it was reduced to a fine powder and mixed with river clay (esan). Kojo took a small amount of the mixture and, rolling it between his hands, created the balls (ntinkaa bidie) that would serve as the crotal cores. These were set aside and allowed to dry. Several days later, a fire was prepared in the middle of Osei Kojo's compound. The charcoal-clay balls were placed in a shallow ceramic pot that had been set on the fire. As they heated, he squeezed afema leaves over them (Fig. 1); according to him the leaf juice acted as a hardening agent.5 After remov- ing the balls he placed several large chunks of beeswax (akaa) in the pot and allowed them to melt. A gourd bowl half-filled with water was set near the fire, and Kojo held a piece of white calico (nnwera) over it while his assistant poured the melted wax through the cloth in order to filter out impurities. The bowl of wax was set in the shade and allowed to cool for about thirty minutes. Once solidified, the cake of purified beeswax was removed (Fig. 2). Using a knife, Kojo shaved off a piece and rolled it between his fingers to soften it a bit. Then he placed it on a modeling board (dwum pono) made from odum wood and began rolling it back and forth with a paddle (tabono) made of dsese wood (Fig. 3), periodically dipping the paddle in hot water to help make the wax more pliable. In this fashion, Osei Kojo drew out a number of wax threads (dhweaa). Next, taking one of the charcoal-clay balls, he carefully applied the threads over 60</page><page sequence="2">it (Fig. 4), using a small stick of wood to manipulate them into...r .' . concentric circles that would form the body of the crotal model. Then he attached a small wax loop to its top. The wax models for the other objects-small silent crotals, necklace beads, and finger rings-were similarly sculpted. Fi- nally, each was connected with a small wax rod (gyinae), the casting channel or sprue through which molten brass would later pass (Fig. 5). For the beads and crotals, Kojo made a casting cluster by fusing one central rod to the ends of a ' { number of gyina'e.i ' " The following stage called for another mixture of ground '.? charcoal and clay. This time, however, it was placed in a gourd ,; : ': ' : . ' bowl and thinned with water to produce a fine slip called kekasane. Osei Kojo placed several large banana leaves on his work table. Then, using a chicken feather (akoko-takara), he brushed a thin layer of the slip onto each of the wax models, ' one by one, and set them to dry on the leaves, whose resinous _ coating ensured that they would not stick. After these had dried sufficiently (roughly two hours) a second layer of slip, this one a bit thicker and with a higher proportion of clay, was - applied to the models. Repeating this procedure several times, Kojo patiently built up the casting investment (Fig. 6). Before applying the final layers of clay, he combined three or four models, making sure that all the sprues in a group converged at one point in the clay investment (Fig. 7). The final layers contained no charcoal but were mixed with dried grass so as to be more porous. The final form was rounded on the bottom and concave at the top (Fig. 8, left). After a few days of drying, each mold was pierced in the top with a small hole. The invested models were placed in a fire, round-side down, and heated until the wax inside melted. Then they were removed from the fire with a pair of large tongs (daa sosomu) and inverted over a waiting gourd bowl half-filled with water. The molten wax ran out the hole and was collected from the gourd for future use. With the clay and grass mixture Osei Kojo modeled a number of cups to serve as crucibles (semua) for melting the metal. Brass scraps were placed in each (Fig. 8). Then the cups . . _ .U : were united with an invested model6 and the two parts sealed with a final layer of river clay to make a single, closed system - ^ i.^ (foa dua; pl., mfoa dua) (Fig. 9). In all, eleven invested as- i . . . semblies were readied for casting. The furnace (abura) was a I 45-centimeter piece of corrugated iron pipe roughly 60 cen- i ..... S,?_ _ timeters in diameter, sealed at the base and lined with clay. A 'D hole at the side just above its base served as the tuyere, or - opening through which the forced air of a bellows passes. The last task of the day was to give the lining a fresh layer of clay. Early the next morning the furnace was brought out to the ~--- middle of the compound.

A bottle of imported gin I I: ; appeared, and Osei Kojo poured a libation (Fig. 10), reciting a! lengthy prayer in honor of the spirit of the furnace, Abura sI~ti sI ! ~i! Kofi, and explaining to him that a European had come to doc- ument the casting. Kojo prayed for health and prosperity for himself and those present and at several junctures asked for success in casting. Then he offered an egg to Abura Kofi, plac- ing it on the "head of the furnace" (abura ti), the knob-like protuberance at the rim. After the libation and prayer, pieces of charcoal were placed in the bottom of the furnace, followed by a few faggots, six of the molds set crucible-side down, and more charcoal (Fig. 11). - : i^~ All were carefully arranged to ensure optimum air flow. The bellow's nozzle was aligned with the tuyere, and an assistant began fanning the fire. Once it was properly ignited Kojo cov- ered the top layer of coals with several pieces of broken pot- tery to retain the maximum amount of heat. The assistant con- tinued fanning, until approximately ninety minutes later the flames suddenly turned green-an indication that the brass in the crucibles had melted, releasing cuprous gases.7 Using the large tongs Kojo removed the sherds and top layer of coals, and pulled each of the molds from the fire, quickly inverting them so that the molten brass would fill the cavities left by the wax models. The glowing mfoa dua were leaned against the wall to cool, and the remaining five molds were placed in the fur- nace. About twenty minutes later, Osei Kojo took a cutlass and severed the crucible cup from the rest of the mold, revealing a solidified puddle of excess brass in the depression above the sprue. He allowed the fresh castings to cool for another ten or fifteen minutes and then, using the cutlass again, shattered the investments. Three of the six castings were successful; the others had failed due to faulty spruing. The same procedure was followed for the second group of five, of which only two were successful.8 When the last mold had been removed, the furnace was N - tipped on its side, the hot coals doused with water, and the oven allowed to cool. Late in the afternoon, Kojo placed the bellows on top of it. Then, to thank Abura Kofi for bringing success to the day's work, Kojo sacrificed a white cock. Recit- ing a prayer, he cut its throat with a knife and allowed some blood to fall upon the abura ti and bellows.9 When it was dead, he severed its wings, feet, and head, and tied them to an assemblage called abura adidie (lit., the food of the furnace), a collection of the same parts from fowls previously sacrificed to Abura Kofi. So ended the most important day of the casting process. Over the next few days Osei Kojo leisurely finished the rings, crotals, and beads. Cutters (awidi or awiri) were used to ,,~,.- - remove the sprues from the fresh castings. Then each brass ^^-, ^ object was carefully chased with three types of files-flat (kitae apra), round (ditae droben), and triangular (kitae akensa). A ring mantle (simply referred to as dua or wood) was used in work- ' ing with the finger rings. The charcoal-clay cores were crushed and removed from the crotals and replaced with small chunks ''.. ^ ^^ ?of brass. Finally, roughly three weeks after he had started, Osei Kojo ~[!Y Ii:~ proudly presented me with the crotals, finger rings, and beads (Fig. 12). Despite having lost more than half the castings, he was pleased with the outcome considering that he had not done it for a long time. YINAE) THAT WILL Very little is known about the origins of this complex pro- STMENT AROUND cess. The earliest archaeological evidence for casting in the CASTING ASSEM- Akan region dates from the sixteenth century. In the south, near the coast, excavations at sites near Dawu and Asebu have 62</page><page sequence="4">yielded evidence dating from the sixteenth and seventeenth ' :,t i; centuries.'0 In the northern Akan region, among the Bono, : recent finds at the sites of Beo and Bono Maaso indicate that . brass casting was practiced in this area at least as early as the sixteenth-seventeenth centuries. 11 In addition, among the ear- liest documentary accounts of the Gold Coast are references to goldwork, from which we can infer that the Fante (i.e., coastal) Akan) were employing cire perdue techniques by the second half of the fifteenth century.12 At present there is little on which to base theories of origin for this technology. Neverthe- less, existing data suggests that the process came to the Akan area toward the end of the fourteenth century from the north (i.e., Western Sudan) in association with the Akan-Dyula gold trade. Thereafter, it spread throughout the Akan forest, N . quickly finding its way to the coast. It is likely that by the beginning of the fifteenth century, casting workshops had _ been established at several Akan trading centers.'3 .. The designs for the earliest Akan castings of brass vessels (kuduo) and goldweights were probably based on prototypes from the Western Sudan, North Africa, and the Middle East; but they soon evolved into a uniquely Akan aesthetic idiom.14 Until the twentieth century, traditional kuduo, shrine utensils, and goldweights were wrought with great skill and sophis- tication. The castings of Osei Kojo are modest by comparison. The Dyula, who were Mande traders, probably arrived at the northern fringe of the Akan forest during the latter half of the fourteenth century. There they tapped one of the world's richest goldfields'5 and established themselves in a number of strategic communities among the Bono, where their commer- cial interests are believed to have acted as a catalyst in the formation of the first centralized Akan state, Bono Maaso. If f we accept the hypothesis that the complex lost-wax casting technology was associated with the Mande presence in this area, it is reasonable to assume that the Bono were the first Akan people to assimilate it. Unfortunately, oral traditions of the Bono (or any other Akan people) do not help much to : reconstruct the early history of the casting process. :_ From existing information we surmise that the goldsmiths of . . . i:: ancient Bono Maaso were organized under a single chief or ,! stool. Today this stool is called the Aburase Dua, and its occu- pant, the Aburasehene (lit., chief of the forge), lives in Buoyem. 16 Interviews with Osei Kojo and his uncle, Nana Kofi Kensah, the present Aburasehene, revealed that this stool has not always been associated with Buoyem; prior to the Bono- Asante war of 1722-23, the state's casting workshops were closer to the Bono capital, eighteen kilometers northeast of Takyiman, near the village of Manso. 17 After the Asante vic- tory over the Bono, the Aburase Dua was taken to Kumase. snZi~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ _~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...

Buoyem continues to be the home of the Aburasefo, though some of its members live in other Takyiman-Bono villages or in the town of Takyiman itself.18 Osei Kwasi was suc- ceeded by his brother, Tutu. Next came Tutu's son, Kra Kwasi, elder brother of Kofi Kensah and father of Osei Kojo. It was he who taught Osei Kojo the cire per- due casting technique. 19 My conversations with Osei Kojo also yielded some interesting information about a previously undocumented cate- gory of metal specialists. When I asked Kojo if he was able either to manufacture or repair brass basins, he replied that he was a caster, not a sheet brass worker (sansafo). Sansafo, he said, are repousse specialists who produce containers like the well-known forowa. They can also mend brassware using soldering tech- niques. He added that they were not generally found in the Bono region, but rather in the southern Akan states like Denkyira.20 Strong traditions in both the Asante and Bono areas maintain that the Asante acquired knowledge of various craft spe- cializations, including metal casting, from the Bono. The first recording of such a tradition is Reindorf's late- nineteenth-century account of the Bono-Asante war of 1722-23. It is said 00 4p { that after the Bono defeat, the para- mount chief, Bonohene Ameyaw Kwakye I, was taken captive to Kumase, where he taught Asantehene Opoku Ware "how to make gold and silver weights" (Reindorf 1966:72). Most rec- orded versions of this tradition indicate that the Bonohene's goldsmiths were taken to Kumase to serve the Asan- tehene.21 During the eighteenth century, a period of Asante territorial expansion, it was common for the artisans of van- quished states to be taken to the Asante capital to produce regalia for the ruling elite. To this day, the goldsmiths there are organized into distinct groups based on ethnic origins; those from the Akan states of Denkyira, Akyem, and Takyiman are each headed by a chief smith who answers to the Kumase Ad- wumfohene, the Asantehene's chief goldsmith.22 Information collected among the Takyiman-Bono corroborates this. In 1922, Rattray, while in Takyiman, re- corded that the "Ashanti did not know [the] cire perdue method of casting which came from Takiman."23 Eva Meyerowitz's (1952:43) Takyiman infor- mants indicated that Bono smiths "taught the Asante how to decorate the state emblems with gold, and how to make gold jewellery for the King and chiefs, and gold and silver jewellery for the Queenmother and the royal women." And in 1970 Warren and 12. THE COMPLETED CASTINGS: CROTALS (NTINKAA OR NDOMMA), SMALL SILENT CROTALS (NNONNOMMA), FINGER RINGS (NKAWA), OPENWORK NECKLACE BEADS (MBOMOFRANA), AND SOLID NECKLACE BEADS (MFOTOBA). Brempong (1971:71) interviewed the ex- Takyimanhene, Akumfi Ameyaw, who spoke of the artistic and technological debt the Asante owed the Bono: "The culture of Asante came from Techiman, Ohene Ameyaw was a great king. His treasury was different from that of Asante. Techiman had a gold treasury but Asante had pieces of iron. Asante had no gold. How could they make gold ornaments? The Asante did not know anything like gold state swords. Every- thing they had was made of iron, the same as is used for making hoes, but they called it gold.... When the Asante conquered Techiman, they picked some of the people who knew handiwork and took them to Asante. They selected goldsmiths and men who knew other crafts." The present Takyimanhene, Ameyaw Kwakye II, related a variation of the tradition in which his captive an- cestor, Bonohene Ameyaw Kwakye I, teaches Opoku Ware about the use of gold. "One day the Asantehene and Bonohene were playing oware and after playing for some time their hands began to smell and were dirty. The Bonohene said that he had an oware game made of gold that one could play for two days without any sign of smell or dirt. The Asantehene promised that if the Bonohene sent for the game and it ar- rived he would set him free. The Bonohene told the Asantehene where it had been hidden, and it was sent for. When it arrived it was truly gold and the Asantehene asked to keep it for himself. Following this, the Bonohene told the Asantehene about weighing gold."24 Considering the documentary and ar- chaeological record, it is unlikely that Bono artisans actually introduced cire perdue in Asante. The evidence cited ear- lier clearly indicates that the process had reached the coast at least 200 years before the rise of that state. However, during the late seventeenth and early eigh- teenth centuries, Asante may have been "somewhat less advanced" than more mature states like Bono Maaso and De- nkyira. These oral traditions, therefore, could allude to the introduction of pro- cesses used to manufacture objects serv- ing as symbols of wealth, status, and au- thority. Reconstructing the early history of Akan cire perdue technology is difficult since the tradition is at least five hundred years old. Indeed, many of the pieces to this historical puzzle will never be found. Some of them, however, are still accessible. Further archaeological re- search will surely produce new data. In addition, we must investigate the technologies and oral traditions of groups like the Takyiman-Bono if we are to learn more about the evolution of this important process. O Notes, page 85 13.

NEVADOMSKY, notes, from page 47 I am grateful for the assistance of the following individuals in the preparation of this paper: Ikponmwosa Osemwegie and Rebecca Agheyisi for helping with the translation of Bini songs, terms, and proverbs; Angela Asemota for translating the relevant passages in von Luschan; Ben Valk for providing information on local birds; Chiefs Oliha and Edohen for allow- ing me to photograph their ivory equestrian staffs; and Greg Airihenbuwa for helping me in the field. 1. 'This and subsequent dates for obas, taken from Egharevba (1968), indicate the beginning of a reign. 2. Although specific names of very poisonous snakes are sometimes offered by informants-to emphasize the poten- cy of the staff-in fact it is the representation of the snake that matters. The Bini regard virtually all snakes as dangerous. Hence, they are called "the child of thing bad" (ovbi-emwin- kho). 3. From a strictly traditional point of view, the figure of a chameleon on the staff has nothing to do with its ability to change colors (Ben-Amos 1976:250). Rather, the Bini believe that touching a chameleon will burn or inflame one's hand: "Erokhin has burned his hand" (Erokhin vbuavbua ere obo). Thus the Bini always hold a chameleon with a stick. Nor does its appearance on the staff have anything to do with the fact that a double-dealing person may be referred to as a chame- leon (Rebora 1983:30-31). While it is true that medicines are made (for example, by Eziza priests) from its tongue and legs to protect a person against someone who is tricky and deceit- ful, this is not the message implied by the figure of a chameleon on the osun staff. 4. The lamp may be substituted for the staff itself. For exam- ple, Oba Erediauwa recently confirmed the Ohenukoni of Evbiokoi, who is regarded as a very powerful magician. During the confirmation ceremony, which is normally a felicitous event, a well-placed lamp protected the palace from potential danger. 5. Her exalted position does not permit one to refer directly to the source of her powers. Rather than say "womb of char- coal" (charcoal = night = witchcraft), which is what is in- tended, the opposite is said. 6. Unfortunately, my use of bird identification books among villagers not accustomed to identifying birds in this manner was not very successful. This may also be due to the fact that the only books on birds available to me were Elgood's Birds of West African Town and Garden (1960), which is based primari- ly on the author's experiences in southern Nigeria but limited in scope because it includes only birds seen by the author in a garden or compound; and Hvass's Birds of the World (1963), which is simply too broad in coverage. I am grateful to Mr. Ben Valk, a Dutch engineer residing in Benin and something of an amateur expert on birds, reptiles, and fish, for his sug- gestion that the bird of disaster may be the talking myna. 7. The Ewini are organized by Ogbelaka quarter. The people of Ogbelaka are said to have come originally from Ugbo- Umaghan, Oba Ewedo's mother's village. Typically, an Oba, as a way of honoring his mother (and her kinsmen), and thus elevating them in status, gives them some royal function to perform. Oba Ehengbuda, for example, did a similar thing when he established the Onudo band that comes from his mother's village of Irele, in the Ondo region. 8. The timetable for the recent Ugie Oro festival was as follows: July 25, Opening Ceremony (3 p.m.); July 26, Indoors Only; July 29, Ugie Continues (5 p.m.); July 30-August 1, In- doors Only; August 2, Closing Ceremony (3 p.m.). All out- door ceremonies except the closing one took place at the main entrance gate of the palace. The closing ceremony occurred in Ugha Ovonrramwen (also known as Ugha Erha Oba). Ugie Oro is preceded by Ugie Ivie, the festival of royal beads, also introduced by Esigie, to commemorate the victory over Udo, then a powerful rival mini-state about thirty-two kilometers west of Benin City, but now a backwater community. Accord- ing to tradition, Esigie and his giant half-brother, Aruaran of Udo, fought for possession of the royal coral bead (known as Iviokpaigbaurhu, "One bead cannot make the entire neck") that would be used to determine the capital of the kingdom. In its general outline this struggle is reminiscent of many other dynastic disputes that have occurred throughout Benin's history. The main ceremony of Ugie Ivie takes place at Ugha Ovonrramwen, the quadrangle containing the shrines of nearly all past Obas. There the king's coral bead regalia, formerly the monopoly of the Oba, from which he makes gifts to chiefs at their installation are magically fortified with the blood of sacrificial animals. Throughout this period wearing coral beads is forbidden; chiefs substitute white plastic or glass beads if they feel compelled to distinguish themselves from the common man. The ceremony concludes with members of Iwebo, the palace association charged with performing Ugie Ivie, marching around the town to inform the senior chiefs that they may resume the wearing of coral bead regalia. 9. They dance counterclockwise because this is the way the Bini "read" divination, that is, from right to left. Seven signifies ritual or magical power. The groups and order of precedence were: (1) palace chiefs, (2) town chiefs, (3) Osa and Osuan (only Osuan participated; at the time a new Osa had not been installed), (4) the Uzama and Chief Inneh, head of the Uzama n'lbie, (5) Chief Ezele, second in rank among the Efa, sanctifiers of the land (he nullifies any potentially dangerous charms), and (6) the Oba (accompanied by the Isekhurhe, his chief ritual priest). 10. For personal health reasons that had nothing to do with the historical aspects of the ceremony, neither the Oloton nor the Eholo n'lre participated in Ugie Oro. Had they taken part, they, like Chief Erro, would have beaten bronze birds rather than ivory equestrian figures. Bibliography Agheyisi, R. n.d. A Dictionary of the Bini Language. Benin City.

SILVERMAN, notes, from page 64 This article is dedicated to Nana Osei Kojo, who generously shared both his time and extensive knowledge of brass casting with me. Research was supported by fellowships granted by the U.S. Department of Education, the Social Science Research Council, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Samuel H. Kress Foundation. I assume full respon- sibility for the statements and opinions presented here. 1. These castings-a miniature bell, drum, and harp-lute (sanko) and two pectoral ornaments-were taken back to England and presented to the British Museum (McLeod 1977:91-93). 2. Evidence recently published by McLeod (1981:80) attests to the "survival of the process in the goldsmith's trade": around 1910 there were at least 85 registered goldsmiths work- ing in or near Kumase, and most of the major traditional states each had about six registered goldsmiths. Additional evidence is presented in a document titled "List of Goldsmiths Resi- dent in Kumasi and District (Licence 'B') during the year 1927" that lists 294 registered goldsmiths (Ghana National Archive, Kumase, D1613). This significant rise in the number of goldsmiths undoubtedly reflects the revitalization of the Asante nation after the repatriation of the exiled Asantehene, Prempeh I, in 1924. 3. Apparently he did produce some brass objects in the mid-1970s for the archaeologist Kwaku Effah-Gyamfi as part of an ethno-archaeological study. 4. In addition to this article a video, "Bono Brasscasting," has been made, as part of the African Encounters Series, African Studies, University of Washington, Seattle. 5. Rattray's informants (1927:312) indicated that the juice prevented the core from cracking. 6. The small chunks of brass placed in the crucible cups were scraps of metal saved from previous castings. Osei Kojo in- dicated that he used to purchase brass ingots in Kumase. To- day they are no longer available; instead, active brasscasters, such as those working at Kurofofurom, use pieces of sheet brass obtained by cutting up old brass basins or scrap metal from old automobiles. 7. In documenting the casting of goldweights at Takyiman in 1922, Rattray (1923:308) noted that the brass melted in on- ly fifteen minutes. This was undoubtedly because the smith placed only one foa dua in the furnace. 8. It is interesting to note that Rattray, documenting the casting process at Bekwai 80 years ago, was struck by the high incidence of "failures," which he attributed to the artisans' 85</page><page sequence="8">being out of practice: "The metal-workers who were collected around me to make the series of castings.. .were sadly out of practice. Faulty castings were numerous and the failures were costly; the results too were not comparable with the castings of former times" (1927:311) 9. The prayer is similar to that recorded by Rattray (1927:315) at the consecration of a new forge at Mampon, Asante. 10. In Dawu, a village located at the northern end of the Akwapim hills (near the coast), there is evidence of casting dating from the sixteenth century (Shaw 1961:60-61). The casting of cuprous metals also appears to have taken place at a seventeenth-century site near Asebu, a Fante village located near Cape Coast (Nunoo 1957:15). 11. Excavations in 1975 at the D2 site in the Dwinfuor (ar- tisans') quarter, Beo, unearthed roughly 500 crucible frag- ments dating from the late sixteenth or early seventeenth cen- tury (Posnansky 1976:4, Garrard 1980b:120). Archaeological work at Manso, the site of the ancient capital of the Bono state, revealed cuprous scraps associated with crucible fragments in a thirteenth-sixteenth century context (Effah-Gyamfi 1985: 93, 204). It is important to note that cuprous objects have been discovered in earlier contexts but these finds are not associated with casting. The earliest-a few copper wires-was dis- covered in an eleventh-twelfth century context at the Nyarko site, Beo (Crossland 1976:86). Garrard (1980b:121-24) has recently disputed Crossland's dating of this site, suggesting that the wires may date from as late as the fifteenth century. 12. See Garrard 1980b: 160-61 for a list of these sources. 13. The leading proponent of this theory is Timothy Garrard. See Garrard 1980a: 103-104, 1980b: 159, Silverman 1983:18-19. 14. For a discussion of the evolution of the kuduo and brass goldweights see Silverman 1983 and Garrard 1980a. 15. See Wilks 1982 for a discussion of the Dyula presence among the Akan. 16. At the present time it is not clear whether the Aburasehene is regarded as the chief casting specialist of the Takyiman state or only Buoyem. Conflicting traditions recorded in Takyiman and Buoyem make it impossible to determine the exact status of the Aburase stool. Despite the uncertainty, it is apparent that Buoyem does maintain an important position in Takyi- man Bono history. Its chief is also the Takyiman Oyokohene, chief of the state's royal lineage. In addition, Buoyem main- tains an intimate historical relationship with the villages of Tanoboase, the home of Taa Kora, the most senior Tano dei- ty (an old and powerful religious institution found throughout the Akan area), and Amoma, prior to the Bono-Asante war, the dwelling place of Bono Maaso's legendary Queen Mother, Dwamenawaa. The elders of Buoyem and Amoma recall that the village was founded as a refuge for the Bono royals who had escaped capture during the Asante-Bono war. It also was the hiding place of, and is now the repository for, the golden stool of the Bono nation. Interviews, Buoyem, February 10, 1980; Amoma, March 21, 1980. 17. See note 12, regarding evidence of casting from the thir- teenth to sixteenth centuries at Manso. 18. Garrard (1980a:361) recorded the term buramfo as one who works at a forge. In the course of my interviews in the Takyiman area various informants referred to these specialists as adwumfo (artisans), atomfo (smiths) and mpepewafo (a previously undocumented term for metal casters). 19. As documented by Gordon (1874:40), Rattray (1923:301), and others (Menzel 1968:21, Garrard 1980a:117-18), in- heritance among metalsmiths does not follow the matrilineal descent patterns usually associated with the Akan. Inheritance is based on a loosely structured combination of primogeniture and patrilineal descent. A smith's property and stool (if he is a chief) are usually inherited by his son, his brother, or his brother's son. 20. Interview, Buoyem, February 10, 1980. Several months later I asked the Asantehene's chief goldsmith if he had heard of the sansafo. He replied that there used to be some working for the Asantehene but that they were now "extinct." San- safo were beaten-metal specialists who produced gold leaf for covering state regalia, made wire, and were responsible for binding the deceased chief's bones with gold wire. Curious- ly, the Adwumfohene asserted that the sansafo did not make mforowa. Interview, Kumase, October 16, 1980. 21. A good example is found in Agyeman-Duah's (1963:1) recording of Asante Asumfuo traditions in which it is stated "that formerly there were three recognized chief goldsmiths resident in Ashanti, namely the Denkyerahene's goldsmith, the Tekyimanhene's goldsmith, and the Okyenhene's gold- smith. These goldsmiths no doubt were captives of war or prisoners taken to Kumasi by conquest of war, and affiliated to [sic] the Ashantis." 22. Denkyira was conquered by Asante in 1701, Bono Maaso (Takyiman) in 1722-23, and Akyem in 1742. 23. R.S. Rattray Fieldnotes, Royal Anthropological Institute Library, London, MS 106, p. 993. 24.

ROBERTS, notes, from page 35 Four years of anthropological fieldwork (1973-77) among the Tabwa of Zaire were supported by grants in aid from the Na- tional Institute of Mental Health (#1-FO1-MH-55251-01- CUAN), the Committee on African Studies and the Edson- Keith Fund of the University of Chicago, and the Society of the Sigma Xi. Subsequent archival research has been funded by a Mellon Foundation Faculty Development Grant at Al- bion College (1983) and a National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Stipend (1984). This paper is a further step in the research for "The Rising of a New Moon: A Century of Tabwa Art," an international exhibition sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities, with assistance from Sabena Belgian World Airlines. Dr. Evan M. Maurer, Director of the University of Michigan Museum of Art, is my project partner for this ex- hibition, and Mary Kuiawski, Curator of Education at the same museum, our close collaborator. Thanks are extended to them for support in writing this paper. Despite such generosity, I alone am responsible for the paper's content. For Bene and Kapiteni. 1. De Heusch's comment, quoted here, is specifically address- ed to the example of Tabwa art; see his introduction to the Tabwa exhibition catalogue (Roberts &amp; Maurer 1986: ix-x). His broad studies (1972/1982a, 1982b) are landmarks to an under- standing of a system of thought common to Bantu-speaking peoples. Luba and Tabwa vary in politico-economic history, and each group has exploited ideas (metaphors, themes) held in common, according to historical needs (see Roberts 1986). 2. See Roberts (1986) for a discussion of this symbolism, and Roberts &amp; Maurer (1986) for a catalogue raisonne of all known Tabwa sculpture. Perusal of the latter allows one to see how the midline is a significant iconographical feature of most ancestral figures, and of combs, bellows, and other objects as well, which are thereby given an anthropomorphic allusion. 3. See Willis (1967) on this symbolism among Fipa of south- western Tanzania, who share much culture and history with Tabwa. The male-centric viewpoint of such assertions is acknowledged and seems an aspect of Tabwa art, made by male artists, according to a male-centric ideology. 4. The phrase is from Zahan (1975); Tabwa tegumentary language is discussed in greater detail in Roberts (1986). 5. This material is from an anonymous, handwritten notebook in Swahili without title, pagination, or date, probably writ- ten around the turn of the century by a Tabwa catechist or seminarian, perhaps Stefano Kaoze or with his collaboration; it is now in a file with materials collected by J. Weghsteen at the General Archives of the White Fathers (Missionaries of Africa), Rome #803/121. 6. Harald von Sicard (1966) has reviewed this literature, but does not include Mbidi Kiluwe among related "Luwe" trick- ster heroes. De Heusch (1982b) discusses duality and half- beings in a number of Central and Southern African cultural contexts, and Zahan (1975) broaches a more general discus- sion of the topic. 7. Burton (1961:4) discusses Mbidi Kiluwe's reputed origins; dictionaries such as Van Acker (1907:47) and Goodall (1921:56) prove useful for etymology of terms such as these. 8. These matters are discussed in more detail in Roberts 1980: 465; 1986:26-29. 9. "Process" versus "statement" art is a useful distinction first drawn by Malcolm McLeod (1976), which is applied to Tabwa in Roberts 1986:10-16. Process art is associated with magic, ritual, and transformation, and is used to assist peo- ple in determining the courses of their lives through divina- tion, healing, and other active measures. Statement art is for- mal and conservative, and is associated with ceremonies meant to reinforce and glorify an existing political order. The flowering of Tabwa arts in the second half of the nineteenth century came as statement arts were introduced to add legitimacy to the growing centralized, "royal" political organization of certain chiefs engaged in the ivory and slave trade to the East African coast. 10. Victor Turner's work on liminality (1981:93-111) is cen- tral to this discussion, for it is he who has demonstrated the manner in which a person can be moved from one social state to another through the "ritual process," which includes an important moment when the initiate is "betwixt and be- tween" these two states. During this crucial phase, one ex- periences "the peculiar unity of the liminal: that which is neither this nor that, and yet is both," a moment of "primitive hypothesis" and "pure possibility" when alternatives to or- dinary existence can be contemplated and sought. 11. Storms mentions this (Jacques &amp; Storms 1886:87) and several other instances when he encountered Tabwa diviners using wooden figures. Object no. 152 in the Tabwa exhibi- tion catalogue raisonne (Roberts &amp; Maurer 1986:243) is just such a figure, used by a contemporary diviner in the area near Mpala, Zaire, in the 1970s. 12. The materials collected with these figures are shown in the plates of Jacques &amp; Storms 1886. A number of Tabwa ob- jects examined during the course of the exhibition research have been "cleaned," probably by dealers or collectors; while others (see Roberts &amp; Maurer 1986:149) were transformed by Tabwa themselves, when former magical ingredients were changed or remgved. 13. Pierre Colle (1913:601-17) was the earliest author to describe Bagabo, but because the Belgian colonizers con- sidered the society subversive and felt that its members us- ed murder and other aggressive means to prey upon the fears and "gullibility" of nonmembers, long administrative reports were prepared describing such nefarious practices (e.g., Van Vyve 1927). As with many early missionary and colonial documents, modern readers will learn more about the biases of the authors than about those these writers purported to describe (see Van Geluwe 1981:223-25). Tabwa lion-men and the terrorism against rival chiefs, missionary followers, and others during the late nineteenth century are discussed in Roberts 1983a and 1985. 14. These important objects have not been studied in the field, and the Bagabo society, like other important cross-ethnic associations in both precolonial and colonial times, deserves far more attention than it has received in the literature. Tab- wa had and still have a number of these important foci for ritual and artistic endeavor. One of these was Butwa (Roberts 1986: 35-36), whose initiates received a distinctive V-shaped scarification pattern carved into many ancestral figures, as in Figure 1. On Tabwa ngulu earth spirits, see Roberts 1984. 15. Kalunga horns are similar in form to kinkungwa horns of BaMbwela hunting guild members, set to swing and indicate the direction of significant game; and lilamfya war horns us- ed by southern Tabwa and Bemba. Several examples of the latter were exhibited recently in Margaret Carey's Bemba ex- hibition at the Museum of Mankind, British Museum. For a sense of the range of Tabwa carved staffs, see Roberts &amp; Maurer 1986:255-57. 16. A number of sources of information on these terms are reviewed in Van Avermaet &amp; Mbuya 1954:388. These same ideas appear in many monographs concerning Zairian peo- ples; on Kongo, for instance, see MacGaffey 1983:122-47. 17. Early explorers found that Tabwa coiffures were the most ornate of those encountered in East and Central Africa; several of their descriptions are in Grunne 1986:91-92 and Roberts &amp; Maurer 1986:203. 18. Tabwa divination and traditional medicine are discussed in the writings of Christopher Davis-Roberts (1980; n.d.). 19. The balamwezi or "rising of a new moon" motif is found on all manner of Tabwa art and material culture, and is a cen- tral metaphor of their philosophy, discussed in Roberts 1986: 1-3.
