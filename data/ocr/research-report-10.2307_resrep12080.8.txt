<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> State-Building and the Double-Edged Sword   of Religion Dr. Albert B. Randall Austin Peay State University  What we today know as philosophy—knowledge  gained by logically reflecting on human experience— and science—knowledge gained by applying inductive  logic to empirical observations—began over 2,000  years ago in Greece. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle  produced a method of inquiry that identified several  necessary conditions for knowledge. Two are especially  fundamental for this paper: (1) Reflecting on experience  and communicating those reflections for debate; and,  (2) the need for clarity of language—that is, as far  as possible, eliminating ambiguity, vagueness, and  mere subjective opinion from the search for truth and  knowledge. Socrates taught many arrogant sophists  and Greek politicians the folly of claiming to know  what they did not know.  Concerning the subject of this paper, two terms  must be put under the microscope of reflection: State-  (Nation-) Building and Religion. Regarding state- building, two problems have eroded America’s efforts  in the Middle East. First, stereotypes and political  myopia have created assumptions that states can  be formed by external coercion. Dr. Richard Gildrie  identified this problem when he said with regard to  state-building:  It is conceivable that some loose form of constitutional  empire, embracing relatively autonomous cities and  tribal areas, might better suit Arab traditions and soci- ety than the current collection of dubious national states  mainly designed and [artificially] imposed by European  33 </page> <page sequence="2"> powers after WWI [and WWII]—[The Sykes–Picot Trea- ty].1    Gildrie’s warning about state–nation stereotypes  and external coercion are prophetically appropriate for  any just and lasting peace in Iraq, as well as other parts  of the world where state-building is needed. Consider  the fatwa (religious decree) issued by Ayatollah Ali al- Husayn Sistani, who is the most influential voice in Iraq  speaking for pragmatic peace and the best corrective  to the militant, revolutionary Shi’ism advocated by  Muqtada al-Sadr: The Occupational Authority in no way has the authority  to choose members of the drafting committee of a Basic  Law. . . . no . . . authority exists for such a committee  to represent the lofty interests of the Iraqi people or to  translate into law the wishes and basic identity of the  Iraqi people, the pillars of which are the glorious faith of  Islam and society’s values. The current [American] plan  discussed is fundamentally unacceptable. Accordingly,  popular elections are necessary so that each Iraqi . . . can  choose his representative for a constituent assembly.   . . . any Basic Law written by this assembly must be   approved by a national referendum.2  Second, failure to identify religion in the state– building process has been a major flaw in Iraq, as it  would be anywhere else for that matter. There is an  excellent analysis of the necessity of including religion  in the process of state-building by Chaplain (LTC)  Timothy Bedsole, “Religion: The Missing Dimension  in Mission Planning.” He identifies several reasons  for religion’s ability to shape what happens on the  battlefield as well as the processes of rebuilding society  which inevitably follow armed conflict. Among the  most important are: 34 </page> <page sequence="3">  1. Religion adds a higher intensity, severity,  brutality, and lethality to conflict than other factors;  2. Religion offers a stronger identity to participants  in conflict than other forms of identity such as nation- ality, ethnicity, politics, or language;  3. Religion can motivate the masses quickly and  cheaply, and it often remains outside the view of  nation–state forces;  4. Religion offers an ideology—or a platform for  political ideology—that resonates stronger that other  forms of propaganda;  5. Religious leaders are often the last leaders  left when states fail, and they offer a voice to the  disempowered or oppressed;  6. Religious leaders are often the first to seek peace  and reconciliation after conflict.3 Chaplain Bedsole’s comments make an excellent  introduction to the title of this essay: “State–Building  and the Double-Edged Sword of Religion.”  The Double-Edged Sword of Religion.  The nature of and definition of religion has  puzzled philosophers, scholars of religion, students  of world religions, and most thinkers for centuries. Is  religion an anthropomorphic creation of mankind? An  ancient Greek, Xenophanes (6th century BCE), wrote:  “Yes, and if oxen and horses or lions had hands . . .  and could produce works of art as men do, horses  would paint the forms of the gods like horses, and  oxen like oxen, and make their bodies in the image of  their several kinds.”4 Or is religion the awakening in  humans of a transcendent source of creation, love, and  wonder? Is religion an illusion for the weak-minded  35 </page> <page sequence="4"> that cannot face the brutality of reality, a disguised  political ideology, only another moral theory or a  fairy tale for children? The debate continues. Further,  since traditional Buddhism, Vedanta Hinduism, and  Daoism affirm no supernatural beings, are they really  religions or metaphysical philosophies? There are no  easy answers to these questions.  Since the focus of this paper is state-building and the  role of religion in state-building, especially its “Double- Edged Sword,” I limit my comments about religion to  the better known Western monotheisms—Abraham’s  Quarrelsome Children—Jews, Christians, and Muslims.  The justification for such a limitation is that the major  tasks of state-building that predominantly involve the  United States are in the Middle East, a place sacred  to all three religions. There are significant debates  about the nature of the conflicts occurring there: Is it  a Conflict of Cultures that is irreconcilable? Or is it a  conflict between traditional religious–social customs,  mores, and taboos, and the demons of modernity and  secularism? Or is it really a religious Battle for God  between Jews, Christians, and Muslims? Whatever the  nature of the conflicts in the Middle East, religion is a  critical factor.   Although the specific analyses, issues, and  principles that emerge in the following comments are  limited to Western monotheism, these same analyses,  issues, and principles are by extension and modification  applicable to other parts of the world where Buddhism,  Hinduism, and Daoism are major influences, as well  as where they interact with Western monotheism. For  example, in Afghanistan, Islam is strongly influenced  by both Hinduism and Buddhism. While it is important  to identify positive principles necessary to just and  peaceful state-building, the process must also describe  36 </page> <page sequence="5"> and critique the mistakes and misconceptions that erode  and compromise just and peaceful state-building.  Since genuine dialogue requires sharing ideas,  beliefs, and values, it is important to understand what  Abraham’s Children share in common, and how these  shared beliefs can lead to either unity or conflict. First  and foremost, all three religions take seriously the  belief in Sacred History. As commonly understood,  history examines events in terms of natural and human  causality, but Sacred History introduces the Divine  into historical events.  Sacred History is the belief that the One God began  both time and history in the act of creation. Further,  Jews, Christians, and Muslims believe that the world  was created for peace and justice, and that in spite of  the chaos humans have introduced into God’s creation  through war and injustice, God will redeem His  creation. Thus, the Creator God of Sacred History is  also a Provident God; He cares about his creation and  takes an active role in moving it to a defining, fulfilling  End, which will restore the original peace and justice of  creation. Beliefs about this divine, predestined End of  Sacred History, which is preceded by times of suffering  and chaos, have been sources of great hope in times of  tribulation and have elicited powerful emotions and  sometimes violence.  A Provident God acts through natural events and  the human community. Since both natural and human  events take place in space and time, land takes on a  significance that can hardly be overestimated. When  land becomes Sacred Land, its significance goes beyond  the temporal world and becomes part of the eternal,  Divine plan, which unfortunately has been misused  by religious extremists to provide justifications for  Holy War. The Crusades are only one example of the  37 </page> <page sequence="6"> violence that centers on Sacred Land. The two primary  ways that God acts through the human community  is by calling individuals—the most important being  prophets, but also Imams and Ayatollahs—and by  Choosing Peoples to fulfill specific tasks.  Prophets are central to these monotheisms because  they are the human vehicles through which Holy Books  emerge and take form. Jews, Christians, and Muslims  share a common Prophetic Tradition whose origins  emerge in the 8th Century BCE. For example, of the  28 Prophets named in the Qur’an, 26 are in the Bible.  The six most important are Adam—the First of God,  Noah—the Preacher of God, Abraham—the Friend of  God, Moses—the Speaker of God, Jesus—the Word of  God, and Muhammad—the Rasul (Messenger) of God.  For Muslims, Muhammad’s selection by God also  means his sinlessness and infallibility (Ma’sum)—a  belief Christians reserve for only Jesus. In Sunni Islam,  sinlessness and infallibility applies to all Messengers,  those through whom God sent a Holy Book. For  Shi’a this sinlessness and infallibility extends beyond  Messengers and Prophets to the original Imams of  Muhammad’s lineage and their deputies, Grand  Ayatollahs—a noun that means “Sign of God.”  In order to begin understanding the Shi’a, one  must recognize the sacredness—the sinlessness and  infallibility—of their Imams, especially the third (Imam  Hussein, Muhammad’s oldest grandson by Fatima and  Ali) and the last Imam (the Mahdi). The most revealing  window into the spirit of Shi’ism is the celebration of  Ashoura—the martyrdom of Imam Hussein at Karbala,  Iraq. This is the paradigm event that defines the  historical conflict between Sunni and Shi’a. The great  Mosque at Karbala and the battlefield outside the city  are still a defining moment for Shi’a—for Ashoura  38 </page> <page sequence="7"> is a celebration that evokes powerful emotions and  passions, which can be a time of spiritual renewal or  violence against oppression.5 The last in the line of the  Twelve Imams from the lineage of Muhammad was  Muhammad ibn Hasan, who became Imam when his  father was murdered in 872 CE. From 872 to 939, ibn  Hasan remained in hiding—the Minor Occultation  (Gayabat)—in order to be safe from harm. In 939,  the Twelfth Imam, Shi’a believe, entered the Major  Occultation through the power of God—that is, he did  not die, and he will remain safely hidden and protected  by God until the predestined end of time, when he will  return as the Mahdi—the Guided One. When he and  the Christ defeat the powers of evil, the world will be  returned to the original purposes of creation—peace  and justice.   A Provident God acts by Choosing Peoples to do  His will and by rewarding them with many blessings,  but most especially Land. One has only to stand at  the Wailing Wall or on the steps leading to the Dome  of the Rock Mosque in Jerusalem—which are only a  stone’s throw away from one another—to become  aware of the passions that center on the belief in being  the Chosen People and the Divine gift of Sacred Land.  Many Saudi Arabian Wahhabi Ulema believe that the  whole of Saudi Arabia is Haram—sacred and forbidden  to infidels (unbelievers). In this theology of Chosenness  and Sacred Land, Osama bin Laden finds Divine  justification for a Holy War against Americans and acts  of terrorism against the Saudi Royal family for allowing  infidels to pollute the sacredness of Saudi Arabia. Two  years after his August 23, 1996, fatwa declaring Holy  War, bin Laden specified that it was a duty “ . . . to kill  the Americans and their allies—civilians and military  . . . for every Muslim who can do it in any country in  39 </page> <page sequence="8"> which it is possible to do it.”6 His so-called fatwa was  actualized in terrorist attacks on the Khobar Towers  in 1996, the African Embassy bombings in 1998, the  bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 and on September 11,  2001 (9/11).7  It is important to note that bin Laden does  not possess the religious credentials to issue a fatwa,  but this point is completely ignored by terrorists who  look for any reason to engage in violence. Concerning  the purpose of these attacks, Laurence Dobrot writes:  In a message attributed to al-Qai’da military command- er Sayf Al Adl in May 2005, he claims the “ultimate ob- jective [of the 9/11 attacks] was to prompt the United  States to come out of its hole and provoke the United  States into attacking areas of the Islamic world.” The  concept was to provoke a disproportionate U.S. military  response that would have the strategic effect of waking  up the “slumbering nation of Islam,” rallying it to the  cause of attacking the United States and the West. The  objective of killing U.S. forces was to create unacceptable  U.S. losses, in terms of both dollars and lives, in an at- tempt to break the will of the American people and force  removal of U.S. forces and influence in the Middle East.  This appears to be part of what is currently happening  in Iraq.8  The same theology is used by Jewish settlers and  extremists for acts of Herem (Holy War) against the  Palestinians and any Israelis—for example, Yitzhak  Rabin—who would trade land for peace. Those who  do so are not only the enemies of the Chosen People  but of God. A 1980 article in the official magazine of  Bar-Ilan University, written by Rabbi Israel Hess, was  titled, “Genocide: A Commandment of the Torah.”  In it, he argued that the Palestinians were modern  Amelikites—a people that God commanded Saul  to commit genocide against because they were His  40 </page> <page sequence="9"> enemies as well as the enemies of the Chosen People.  The same year, a Gush settler—the Gushites represent  the most extreme of the settler movements in Israel— Haim Tzuria wrote: “In each generation we have those  who rise up to wipe us out, therefore each generation  has its own Amalek. The Amalekism of our generation  expresses itself in the extremely deep hatred of the  Arabs to our national renaissance in the land of our  forefathers.”9  Before proposing general principles regarding the  roles of religion in state-building, it is helpful to review  the three basic relationships between state and religion.  It is also important to look beyond cultural, political,  and religious stereotypes that are counterproductive  and destructive of peace and state-building. Further, it  is essential to look beyond traditional Western views of  nations as models for state-building in tribal societies,  beyond American democracy as the paradigm for state- building, and beyond the American First Amendment  as the only compromise possible between state and  religion.  Concerning this last stereotype, it is instructive to  note that the U.S. Supreme Court has been interpreting  and reinterpreting the Constitutional meaning of the  First Amendment for state–church relationships for  over 200 years. Bedsole describes the “creative tension”  between state and church as a  . . . dance between the two partners of state and religion.  The dance is different for every state and religion. It  [the dance] is an analogy that helps soldiers understand  this tension and begin to move away from imposing a  Western centric—American only—form of democracy  on other nations.10   There are three basic ways that state and religion  can be, and have been, historically related: (1) religion  41 </page> <page sequence="10"> controls the state—a theocracy; (2) the state controls  religion; and (3) a separation between religious and  state power. In the brief analyses and descriptions of  the three patterns that follow, it is important to keep in  mind the reciprocal interactions between institutions— the practical dimension of religion and state—and  human meaning and understanding—the intellectual  and spiritual dimensions of human nature. Each  dimension influences the other. Institutions influence  thinking, and human thinking can bring about changes  in institutions.   The political and moral dangers of the first two  relationships are well-known and documented. When  the state controls the religion, the first freedom lost  is that of religious belief. One has only to look at the  1933 formation of the Evangelical Reich Church—the  Evangelish Reich Kirche—which united 29 regional  Protestant churches. The Evangelical Reich Church  selected Ludwig Mueller, a rabid, anti-Semitic Army  Chaplain and close friend of Hitler, as the first Reich  Bishop. Three months after taking control of the  Church, Mueller merged the small Hitler Youth—less  than 10,000—with the German Evangelical Youth— approximately 70,000, which converted the largest  religious youth organization in Germany into Hitler  Youth.11 Later, in an interview, Mueller said that  he prayed for weeks before God guided him in this  decision. In an excellent paper titled “The Nexus of  God and Citizen,” Benjamin Jensen and Lynn Kunkle  describe the danger of the state controlling religion:  “. . . absolute power is a tyranny in and of itself.  Vesting absolute power in the state invariably leads to  Nationalism.”12 In its most extreme forms Nationalism  deteriorates into Fascism, “. . . where the state becomes  a religion and governs every aspect of private iden-  tity . . . .”13 42 </page> <page sequence="11">  The moral and political abuses of the second  relationship are equally well-known. Ironically, when  the religion controls state power, one of the first  freedoms lost is also the freedom of belief. One has  only to look at the Spanish Inquisition, the Khomeini  effort to create a theocracy in Iran and the Wahhabi  Sunni Muslim movement from its inception in the  18th century Najif to its current power in Saudi Arabia.  This relationship creates the inverse of Nationalism:  “. . . positioning absolute power in religion breeds  Fundamentalism.”14 Nationalism and Fundamentalism  both demand .” . . absolute allegiance, and it is within  this demand that the horror of authoritarianism is  born.”15  Because power often corrupts, the least abusive  relationship requires some form of independence and  division of power between state and religion. Related  to the Middle East, it is necessary to set aside four  misconceptions: (1) that efforts to implement Shariah  into the state necessarily mean a Khomeini-type theoc- racy; barbaric, medieval punishments for violations of  law; and abuse of women; (2) the reducing of all Shi’a  views to Khomeini’s revolution; (3) overestimating  the power and influence of Khomeini throughout  the Muslim world and underestimating his declining  influence in Iran; and (4) simplistically assuming that  the major key to establishing peace in the Middle East  can be accomplished by resolving the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict. Achieving peace in the Middle East is more  complicated that just the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.  While resolving this conflict is a necessary condition  for long-term peace, it is not sufficient for establishing  peace throughout the Middle East. Each of these is  briefly addressed before concluding with a statement  of healthy ways that religion can contribute to peaceful  state-building. 43 </page> <page sequence="12">  First, the moment Americans and most Westerners  hear the cry that Shariah must be integrated into the  laws of the state, four stereotypes immediately form:  another tyrannical Khomeini theocracy, religious  persecution, barbaric punishments for crimes, and  abuse of women. The demand for Shariah does not  necessarily mean a theocracy. The history of Sunni  Islam is filled with examples of political power residing  in political leaders, political groups, or tribal chieftains  alongside moral and religious authority residing with  the Ulema. Thus, rather than immediately rejecting the  call for Shariah as dangerous and counterproductive, it  is wiser to explore ways that power can be shared and  Shariah implemented through a division of power.  Shariah as a Muslim way of life and a foundation for  laws and social norms is flexible and adaptable to dif- ferent cultures and different historical circumstances.  Historically and theologically, the Shi’a struggled  for an ideal state in which their Holy Imams or their  deputies, the Ayatollahs, combined both political  and religious power. However, given centuries  of persecution and the minority status of Shi’a in  the Muslim world, they adapted to many different  situations where political power was separated from  religious power. Ayatollah al-Sistani represents a  moderate, pietistic form of Shi’ism that can make  accommodations with political power if the latter  does not violate certain principles of Shi’a theology,  especially freedom of worship.   The argument that democracy is incompatible with  Islam is simply false. In their insightful paper, “The  Nexus of God and Citizen,” Jensen and Kunkle argue  that establishing democracies in Islamic nations should  begin by looking at Islamic history and rediscovering”  . . . an Islamic metaphysical system that conceptualizes  44 </page> <page sequence="13"> individuals within their private lives as both citizens  and believers. . . . The search for an Islamic democracy  must begin by formulating a social contract system that  transcends both Nationalism and Fundamentalism.”16  In other words, Jensen and Kunkle argue that efforts to  find a social contract system for democracy in Muslim  countries based on Western social contract systems— those developed by Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau— are bound to fail because they are inconsistent with  Shariah, a way of life that does not separate citizen  and believer but affirms both roles as inseparable for  just and moral living in God’s world. This is what  Ayatollah Sistani affirmed in his fatwa when he wrote  that the “lofty interests” and “basic identity of the  Iraqi people” are predicated on “the glorious faith of  Islam and society’s values.”17 The major problem in  implementing democracy in Muslim countries based  on Western models is the privatization of belief.  Correctly, Jensen and Kunkle warn that in: . . . Islam, where interiorization or privatization of belief  has never formed a core precept or practice, and where  Islam is understood as din, a way of life [incorporated  into Shariah]; there is less reason to believe a . . . secular  citizenship model . . . would prove a desirable model  for governance. Instead, the Islamic world is challenged  to overcome the Western dichotomization of the indi- vidual [separation of citizen and believer] and develop  a more holistic concept of a public individual as believer  and citizen.18  While there are several social contract systems  proposed by Islamic philosophers and theologians  that can provide workable models for democracy in  Muslim countries, Jensen and Kunkle find one of the  best in the mystical thought of Al-Arabi (12th century  CE). His social contract can be briefly described as  45 </page> <page sequence="14"> follows.19 It is through the individual’s relationship  with God that social consciousness emerges and  matures. In other words, through his relationship with  God, the individual learns that the “I” can only reach  fulfillment in the greater “WE” of the community. For  Jensen and Kunkle, this means that “. . . the individual  in Al-Arabi’s model is granted the inalienable freedom  to exist as believer, but without imposing belief on  others, a view fundamentally consistent with the  Islamic injunction against compulsion in religion.”20  Through submission to God, both the individual and  the community are bound together in a social contract  whose fundamental objective is actualizing the  purposes of creation—peace and justice. In Al-Arabi’s  model,” . . . there is no inherent antagonism between  the individual and the community, believer, and  citizen.”21 This means that the people as a community,  “. . . the source of interpretation and legitimacy,  are empowered to create dynamic and responsible  models of community.”22 From this, it follows that the  legitimacy of the form of government and of a society’s  religious and political leaders is judged by how well  the form of government and its religious and political  leaders contribute to “the self-actualizing potential  of all individuals in a society.”63 In other words,” . . .  developing an Islamic Democracy becomes a question  of which institutions and laws best guarantee the rights  of . . . [the] individual and . . . [his] identity as citizen  and believer.”24 Al-Arabi’s social contract, which is  based on the Qur’an and its implementation in Shariah,  clearly denies the stereotype that Islam and democracy  are inconsistent; quite the opposite is the case.  The stereotype that Shariah means a return to  medieval cruelty and barbarity is not historically  or religiously true. Where such punishments are in  46 </page> <page sequence="15"> effect, it is because of Sunni purist movements such  as the Wahhabi in Saudi Arabia and the Taliban in  Afghanistan or the distorted Khomeini fanaticism as  occurred in Iran.   Finally, that Shariah means the abuse of women  and denial of their rights is also a stereotype. Following  the Qur’an, Shariah provides rights for women that  were centuries ahead of women’s rights throughout  the Christian world. Two of the most important ones  are rights to divorce—Shariah provides women with  more justifiable reasons for divorce than men—and  legal rights of inheritance. Even today, in the United  States, children, male or female, have no legal rights of  inheritance. While it is true that there are inequalities  in the applications of Shariah to women’s rights  throughout the Muslim world, where these rights  are most abused is the result of cultural mores and  customs or the result of extremist groups such as the  Taliban or the Iranian Shi’a rather than Islam. While we  should continue to encourage Arab nations to improve  women’s rights, we should do so with humility and  national self-honesty. Even though America had a  democratic Constitution and a Bill of Rights, it took  over 150 years for women and African Americans to be  included in the voting processes that are necessary to  any real democracy. America and Europe also had the  advantages of 400 years to adapt to modernity through  the advantages of the Renaissance, Reformation, a  developing secular philosophy, and modern science.  Most Middle Eastern Arab nations have had little more  than half a century to struggle with ancient customs  and mores, the political and economic problems of  Western occupations, poverty, limited educational  opportunities, mass movements of urbanization, and  negligible experiences with democracy that challenge  47 </page> <page sequence="16"> them in their struggles with modernity. For example,  30 years ago, the population of Riyadh, the capital of  Saudi Arabia, was only 500,000. Today it is over five  million. These radical changes in such a short period  of time create daunting challenges for government  leaders as well as ordinary citizens, and we should be  fair and humble in our evaluations of their progress  rather than negative and confrontational.   Second, Shi’ism is more diverse than the Khomeini  aberration that occurred in Iran. For example, three  different Shi’a perspectives are found in Iraq. The  pietistic, moderate Shi’ism of Ayatollah Sistani and  many other clerics who follow the views of the great  Ayatollah Khoi represents a pragmatic Shi’ism that is  capable of compromises with political power. On the  opposite pole, more akin to Khomeini is the radical,  militant, activist Shi’ism of Muqtada al-Sadr, which  has strong holds in the slums of Basra and Baghdad as  well as Kirkuk. However, it is worth noting that during  the last 6 months, al-Sadr has cooled his revolutionary  rhetoric and agreed to a limited cease fire on the part  of his Mahdi Army. Hopefully, his actions represent  a long-term, pragmatic moderation of his initial,  radical views. Finally, there is an intermediate Shi’ism  advocated by the Supreme Council for the Islamic  Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) by such individuals as the  Hakim brothers, Baqer and Abdul Aziz. While this form  of Shi’ism is more active than Sistaniis, it is nonetheless  open to compromises on power.25  Third, Americans and Westerners must resist  the simplistic stereotype that all Shi’a are Khomeini  revolutionaries. Initially, Khomeini was a hero to most  Shi’a because he stood up to Saudi Arabia and its  exportation of Wahhabi Sunni Islam into other parts  of the Middle East. Where Wahhabis exercised power,  48 </page> <page sequence="17"> they persecuted Shi’a, Sufis (Muslim mystics), and any  Sunni Muslims who did not practice their extremist- purist form of Islam. Initially, for many Shi’ites, Iran  stood as an example of a Shi’a state ready to defend  Shi’a from Sunni persecution. The United States fell  into the trap of reducing all Shi’a to its Khomeini  aberration, and, as a result, supported a brutal dictator,  Saddam Hussein, as a countercheck against the  revolution spreading beyond Iran. The Iraq-Iran War  changed all of this, not only for the Middle East but for  America. Khomeini’s fanaticism and violent excesses  tarnished his revolution. Khomeini’s barbaric use of  the Cult of Child Warriors in the war and his inhuman  indifference to their deaths, which numbered in the  tens of thousands, seriously eroded his credibility  throughout the Middle East as well as Iran. Vail Nasr  writes: The Islamic revolution is today a spent force in Iran, and  the Islamic republic is a tired dictatorship facing pres- sures to change. The victory of hard-line candidate Mah- moud Ahmadinejad . . . cannot conceal the reality that  grass root concerns about democracy and economic re- form are . . . key factors in Iranian politics. . . . The pull of  modernity and reformism is strong but so also is that of  tradition and conservatism. . . . Iran more than any other  society in the Muslim world is a place where fundamen- tals are under scrutiny and open to questioning and new  thinking.26 Recent elections provide credible evidence for the  accuracy of Nasr’s analysis of the currents of change  occurring in Iran. Keith Lee, Associated Press, writes: Conservative opponents of President Mahmoud Ah- madinejad made a strong showing in Iran’s elections,  according to partial results Saturday. . . . 49 </page> <page sequence="18"> Reformists, meanwhile, claimed to have made better  than expected gains even though most of their candi- dates were thrown out of the race by Iran’s clerical lead- ership. If reformists succeed in expanding the largely muted  block of around 40 lawmakers they had in the outgoing  parliament, it would be a blow to . . . the power of clerics  and . . . [represent an] opening up to the West. Ahmadinejad’s allies were on track to grab the largest  share of the 290 member parliament. But they appeared  likely to face a strong minority of conservative oppo- nents, and . . . reformists.27 In other terms, the moderates are beginning to win  some of the political battles in Iran, and most impor- tantly, some of them are conservatives that come from  those who supported Ahmadinejad in the previous  election. Hopefully, the Bush administration will  recognize the historic importance of the emergence of  the moderates—both old conservatives and reformists— and stifle the confrontational “Axis of Evil” rhetoric  that has seriously compromised the small victories of  moderates throughout the Middle East. Such rhetoric  has, in the past, turned moderates into conservatives  because they believed their nation was being threat-  ened. (See Axiom #8 below.)   Finally, the traditional platitude that the “road  to peace in the Middle East must travel through  Jerusalem”—that is, must resolve the Israeli–Palestin- ian conflict—is not only simplistic but ignores a con- flict that is 1,300 years older than the Israeli-Palestin- ian situation—the Sunni–Shi’a divide. Both conflicts  are critical for peace and require addressing, but the  latter may be more crucial because it is more pervasive  50 </page> <page sequence="19"> throughout Muslim history. Concerning the Israeli- Palestinian controversy, the issues mitigating against  peace are historically and politically more complex  than the general perception.  Unfortunately, far too many political and national  misconceptions and myths of the Palestine War— which lasted less than 2 years from the United Nations  partition of Palestine in November 1947 to the armistice  between Israel and Syria in July 1949—continue to be  instrumental in the current situation and taught in the  school systems of the Middle East by both Arabs and  Israelis. Based on documents released in the 1980s by  the Israeli government concerning the Palestine war— the war of Independence (1948 War) as it is known  by Israelis—a collection of Israeli, Arab, and Western  historians have been engaged in demythologizing  this war and its aftermath. A new collection of essays  published in The War for Palestine: Rewriting the History  of 1948, edited by Eugene Rogan and Avi Shlaim,  tells a significantly different story of this war than the  national myths portray. Concerning the significance  of the Palestine War and its consequences, the editors  write: These 20 months transformed the political landscape  of the Middle East forever. Indeed, 1948 may be taken  as a defining moment for the region as a whole. Arab  Palestine was destroyed and the new state of Israel es- tablished. Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon suffered outright  defeat; Iraq held its lines; and Transjordan won at best  a pyrrhic victory. Arab public opinion, unprepared for  defeat, let alone a defeat of this magnitude, lost faith in  politicians. Within 3 years of the end of the Palestine  war, the prime ministers of Egypt and Lebanon and the  King of Jordan had been assassinated, and the president  of Syria and the king of Egypt overthrown by military  coups. No event has marked Arab politics in the second  51 </page> <page sequence="20"> half of the 20th century more profoundly. The Arab-Is- raeli wars, the Cold War in the Middle East, the rise of  the Palestinian armed struggle, and the politics of peace- making in all their complexity are a direct consequence  of the Palestine war.28  The general consensus of these historians is that  the Palestinians were, for all practical and military  purposes, abandoned by the other Arab powers as well  as by some of their own religious and political leaders.  While many national leaders and Muslim groups  throughout the Middle East expressed a passionate  concern for the Palestinians, it was more rhetoric  than practice. The new documents these historians  are examining provide compelling evidence that the  major concern of the leaders of Syria, Jordan, Egypt,  Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan during the Palestine  War was not the plight of the millions of Palestinians  who became refugees but their own narrow political  interests. They were much more interested in  maintaining their national sovereignty, limiting the  expansion of other Arab countries into disputed areas,  and using the war to expand their land holdings, than  they were in the displaced Palestinians. The present  Middle East situation looks very much like the past,  which unfortunately means that some Arab nations  have more to gain from the conflict continuing than  being resolved.   Any just and lasting peace in the Middle East must  also find ways to bring Sunni and Shi’a together. The  first task in this unifying effort is finding ways to reduce  and limit the influence of Sunni purist movements  such as the Wahhabis and the Taliban, Shi’a extremist  movements such as the Khomeini Revolution and  the militancy of clerics such as Muqtada al-Sadr. This  needs to be done without compromising the efforts  52 </page> <page sequence="21"> of Muslim moderates to find pragmatic and peaceful  solutions to the religious and political conflicts in the  Middle East. The Bush administration’s belligerent  rhetoric of confrontation, threat, and the “Axis of Evil”  has encouraged extremists and undercut the work of  moderates.  In seeking peaceful, just state-building, religion  is not only one factor, but one of the most important;  however, it can be a double-edged sword. It is now  time to identify principles for its healthy role in state- building. Conclusions: Axioms for Religion’s Role in State- Building.  Axiom #1: Do Not Stereotype. Stereotypes of both  state-building and religion are counterproductive.  All religious situations are unique to their historical  circumstances and require flexibility and open- mindedness on the part of those involved in state- building to think outside the box of cultural stereo- types in seeking solutions to religious conflicts.  Axiom #2: Limit Personal Agendas. External groups  whose thinking is culturally and religiously myopic and  chauvinistic or have agendas for their own political– economic gain should be excluded. The Sykes–Picot  treaty that divided the post–World War I and World  War II Middle East into mandates for the economic and  political benefit for the British and the French rather  than the Arabs was an especially egregious example  of the long-term dangers and conflicts that can be  created by external myopic and chauvinistic political– economic agendas. Unfortunately, America’s history  with the repressive Shah of Iran, support for the brutal  dictator Saddam Hussein, and misconceived invasion  53 </page> <page sequence="22"> and mismanaged occupation of Iraq represent for the  majority of Muslims throughout the world another  example of the desire of external Western powers to  control the wealth of the region—especially oil—for  their own economic–political benefit.   Axiom #3: State-building Cannot Be Externally  Forced. Since bullets cannot defeat religious beliefs any  more than they can change cultural, ethnic, and tribal  loyalties, successful state-building cannot be coerced.  Axiom #4: Respect Religious Beliefs. Since religion  is a fundamental source of personal and group identity  that is often more influential that other forms of loyalty  and identity, knowledge of and respect for the beliefs,  values, symbols, and sacred observances of a people’s  religion is a necessary condition for those involved in  the process of peaceful and just state-building.  Axiom #5: Be Inclusive. If possible, where internal  religious differences are a major source of conflict,  all internal differing parties must be included in the  process of state-building. Exclusion only fuels the  fires of religious extremism and gives justification for  violence.  Axiom #6: Co-Opt Violent Groups. “Isolate truly  violent groups not by confrontation, which strengthens  them [and gives their credibility among believers], but  by co-opting them; address the grievances of violent  groups through cooperation.”29  Axiom #7: Protect Sacred Places. Identify, respect,  and protect sacred places and relics.  Axiom #8: Support Moderates. Identify the leaders  of all religious groups and work to incorporate all  of them in the deliberations, encouraging internal  differences to be worked out by relying on the more  moderate ones to lead in seeking compromises  rather than external pressure. If the moderates fail,  54 </page> <page sequence="23"> it is important not to overact and immediately reject  dialogue with the other groups before sufficient efforts  to work with them have been exhausted. While it is  subject to debate, it is possible that had the United  States not immediately rejected the Hamas victory  in the last Palestinian elections as an evil and made  efforts at diplomacy first, the current possibilities for  peace might be different. Even if this would not have  been the case, the American response has provided  justification for charges of hypocrisy. See Axiom #9.  Axiom #9: Mediate Fairly. If external mediators are  involved in the process, it is imperative that they not  only be impartial, but are also perceived by all parties  as impartial and fair. Unfortunately, the relationship  between Israel and the United States and the invasion  of Iraq on faulty intelligence and neo-con political  agendas justify the pervasive Muslim perspective  that the United States cannot be a fair and unbiased  mediator. In order to possess legitimacy as an external  mediator, the mediator must not be perceived as  hypocritical. Consider for example, the following from  an editorial in the Arab News about U.S. hypocrisy in  promoting democracy in the Middle East: Now at least Bush’s perverse vision of the democratic  process is patently clear. A democratic election must  produce a government that is acceptable to the White  House. Anything else will be rejected. The democratic  voice of the people will be ignored unless it is singing  the song that Washington wants to hear. This astound- ing hypocrisy undermines everything America says that  it is trying to achieve in the region and everything that  America once stood for.30 The editorial occurred after the Bush administration  rejected the Palestinian elections in which Hamas  received the majority vote. 55 </page> <page sequence="24">  Axiom #10: Be Compassionate. Emphasize the  central features of religion: practical compassion and  respect for life. Practical compassion means working  for peace and justice for all peoples. For example,  given their differences, Jews, Christians, and Muslims  all believe that God created the world for peace,  and that God requires two things of human beings:  righteousness—love of and faith in God and justice— and compassion for human suffering and respect for all  human life. This is why Chaplain Bedsole argues in his  article that this is not just one ingredient in successful  state-building but a critical one for at least three  reasons: (1) “religious leaders usually survive and fill  in the vacuum when states fall and political leaders are  removed”; (2) “religious leaders are usually the first  to seek reconciliation after conflict”; and (3) “religious  leaders and organizations are usually at the forefront  of humanitarian efforts to feed and provide medical  care for the survivors of conflict and violence.”31  Actualize the practical compassion that is at the heart  of religion.

Bedsole provides the following war story about misun- derstanding the nature of Sacred Places: While in Iraq in 2003, one officer commented, “If we  could just get the Saudis to send their army to Iraq, we  could leave.” He did not have an understanding of the  religious/political history of the area. . . . The forefathers of today’s Saudi government . . . had torn  down this shrine during the past, and there was no love  lost between the two groups. Bedsole’s comments on this paper, p. 8  6.
