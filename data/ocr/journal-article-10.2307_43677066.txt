<plain_text><page sequence="1">Criteria for development control There are no set guidelines for the operation of development control powers, although planners search for objective criteria. Peter F Smith argues for a holistic approach. Legislation in Britain has decreed that one of the most discreetly powerful people in the administration of government shall be the development control planning officer. At the same time, his brief is ill-defined, and any decision he takes exposes him to criticism which often has the cutting-edge of vested interest. He is expected to make value judgements, which, in the absence of established criteria, must be largely subjective. At the same time, his decisions are made in the shadow of the ministry inspector. The history of appeals shows that making value judgements about design can be a risky business, since inspectors tend to adjudicate that design is a matter of personal opinion. For this reason, development controllers tend to prefer objective, mechanical criteria for assessing applications. Then the planner becomes a kind of high priest administering his version of theTorah. In my own area, the Peak Park Planning Board imposes blanket conditions about materials and style which it hopes will drive architects into the vernacular. It is rarely possible to find documentary evidence of preferred designs, but a poster issued by the CPRE in the Peak fully reflects the sympathies of the Board. There is little chance here for an architect to create a really exciting dialogue between artefact and nature by exploiting modern technology. Indeed the planners of the Peak seem to believe that any building in the Park is a mistake, and therefore, if it is inevitable, it must be disguised to look as though it was always there. Frequently, planners will use existing buildings to provide the design datum for new insertions into the environment. Superficially this may mean lining-up storey- heights, parapets and roofs, or creating a unity of materials and colours, etc. This offers ready- made standards which can be applied fairly objectively. In the course of architectural practice, one builds up a dossier of planning criteria in different areas. For example, the local planning officer at High Wycombe insists that no new building shall be higher than the tower of the parish church. Though an attractive tower, such a condition can have extreme consequences. (For example, see above) At Reading I was asked to provide a religious emblem in front of a church. Clearly its design departed so far from the stock image that a sign was felt to be necessary to fit it into the standard vocabulary of urban forms. Unfamiliar designs should, it seems, have captions. Faced with the problems inherent in the Planning Acts some authorities have preferred to opt-out. One can only conclude that this happened during a previous administration in Cambridge which allowed Christ's College to dismember the town end of King Street with a new residential building. On the college side it is architecturally pleasing; from the town aspect it is difficult to imagine a design more destructive to the prevailing ethos of a place. Never have Jeckyll and Hyde been so successfully transmuted into architecture. In scale, shape, orientation and materials, it Peter F Smith, MA, PhD, FRIBA, is an architect in private practice and lecturer in thejheory of design at Sheffield School of Architecture. Built Environment December 1972 633</page><page sequence="2">Christ's College new residential building in King Street, Cambridge : "destructive to the prevailing ethos of a place" displays a total disregard for the medieval scale and structure of King Street. Locally there is a saying which accuses it of "showing its pretty face to the college and its backside to the town". Some put it more bluntly. Things have now changed in the Cambridge administration, and such an event is unlikely to occuragain. Even worse things can happen elsewhere. Another city of strong medieval character tinged with basque vernacular is Bayonne, in south-west France. It recently acquired a large multi-storey car park, even more destructive to the visual texture of the place than the Christ's College building. Being on the riverfront, nothing conceals this monument to the priorities of the latter 20th century. Such criticisms could occupy volumes but the real challenge is to offer constructive suggestions in the context of an already urbanised western Europe in which the crucial problem is how to redevelop within existing towns and cities. As Jane Jacobs has pointed out, to stay alive, cities, like organisms, must be constantly renewing themselves. So development control is a matter of paramount concern. Even though design may be regarded as a subjective matter, it may still be possible to propose guidelines which will help to release planners from arbitrary and limiting canons which are blunt instruments of evaluation. Planners require more information . . . In the first place, development control tends to be atomistic by definition. Redevelopment is often on the scale of individual buildings and usually the scope of information provided in the application for planning consent is quite inadequate in predicting the finished form of the building, never mind its impact on the wider environment. Planners should demand much more than the 1/1 00th scale drawings required under the Building Regulations. Occasionally models and photo-montage are required but this has only occurred twice in my own experience. Certainly the provision of more detailed and accurate information would involve clients in more expenditure at the initial stage, but this would be a small price to pay for preventing some buildings that currently get through the net by not revealing their negative assets. Planners require more information if they are to take a holistic view of the wider environ- ment into which a new building is being inserted. This is where a particular kind of mental agility is needed, because each time a piece of existing urban fabric is replaced, an entirely new entity is created. New building in an established context does not modify the existing space, it creates a totally new urban gestalt or sub-organism. In terms of physics, there is established a unique system of forces which must be evaluated in its own right. We are slow to learn the art of appreciating environment holistically, that is as an entity in which the whole is much more than the sum of the parts. Perhaps it is the fault of the tradition of architectural education, but the majority of architects are geared to thinking in terms of architecture rather than the extended urban milieu. Students and practitioners persist in designing buildings "in vaccuo", whereas they should conceive them as modifications of a much larger organism in which the concept of Architecture as such may be irrelevant. Some of the finest towns and cities of Europe boast hardly anything that would qualify as Architecture. The real poetry of Assisi resides in the totality of abstract form, rhythm, colour and texture. Perhaps it is intrinsic to the architectural personality to wish to be remembered by monuments. But this aspiration is often incompatible with the proper concept of urban design. Maybe the popular maestri of today are really the last of the architectural dinosaurs. 634 Built Environment December 1972</page><page sequence="3">Above : Bayonne, France. Below : Nantwich, Cheshire . . . and an understanding of DOVE compatibility . . . Secondly, assessment of built form has always been much concerned with scale. This has never been properly defined, but usually has a connection either with adjacent buildings or with the size of Le Corbusier's average man. So, it resolves down to a matter of style or anthropomorphic dimensions. In the former case the tendency is to require conformity between the major elements of the new and existing. Window rhythms storey heights, etc, should correspond, and one of the classics in this respect is Andrew Renton's Dock Board Offices in St Katherine's Dock, London. Such evaluation may be adequate in some circumstances; in other instances it may be too limiting. A more abstract definition of urban scale is required which imposes a discipline upon the architect without curtailing his design freedom. Such demands are met by a scale which involves density of visual events. New architecture can occasionally be found within a traditional context which has made no stylistic concessions to its neighbours and yet which sets up a sympathetic dialogue on a level transcending obvious phenomenal details. As an example of this the new additions to Brasenose College might be cited. The rapport between the old and new depends on the purely abstract affinity between density of visual events, which might be abbreviated as the DOVE scale. A visual event is any perceptual difference within a particular con- text and may be equated with the "just noticeable difference" (JND) known to psychologists. Perception of differences is a matter of learning since the brain is not normally concerned with making such subtle discriminations between elements of the visual array. This DOVE scale may be considered as defining the frequency of perceptual events. As a preliminary to assessment of the new situation created by an architectural insertion, the density or frequency of visual events as abstract happenings within the visual field may begin to show whether the insert will be sympathetic to the broader context. Techniques may be derived to measure DOVE compatibility. For perception of visual events to be efficient, the built milieu should, if possible, be divested of cognitive meaning so that it is perceived as an abstract pattern. Schematic recognition tends to cloud the issue. A simple way to achieve this would be to view a reconstruction of the proposed total assembly of buildings in negative form. A better way would be to convert the scene into a code such as occurs between the eye and thebrain. This way density could be measured withoutany cognitive "noise". Maybe the hologram produced by laser photography has potential in this respect. . . . which is inseparably linked to IVE Thirdly, frequency is inseparably linked to amplitude. This means that density of visual events must be equated with intensity of visual events, (IVE scale). Here we are concerned with the intensity of difference between elements of the visual scene or, more specifically, the urbanscape. Such things as depth of shadow, change of plane, or contrast of materials in colour and texture account for amplitude or intensity. This is a matter of correspondence on the level of figure against ground. If there is constancy of scale on these two levels between the existing and the proposed addition the probability of creative amelioration is enhanced. What this means in practice can be illustrated by a small urban sequence in Nantwich, Cheshire. Development dating from the late middle ages co-exists perfectly with buildings of the 1 8th century. Though different in style, rhythm and materials there is constancy in density and intensity of visual events, which transcends such differences. Unity prevails over diversity. This unity of scale collapses suddenly and catastrophically with the disclosure of a standard piece of contemporary commercial development. Here the mesh of the net was much too wide, but nevertheless it highlights a dilemma. The economy of the present design vocabulary combined with the "clean- ness" of the modern aesthetic tend to make it difficult for architects to tune-in to a different frequency. Unfortunately, many fail to see this as a problem, and there may even be those who would regard this hypothetical re- development of King's Parade as an improve- ment (see over). Historically, builders seemed to possess an unconscious skill in maintaining consistency of visual events throughout a whole town. It is apparent in places like Amsterdam and Bayonne. The latter has already illustrated how the absence of this skill in just one building can undermine the visual quality of a much wider expanse of the environment. For large scale development absolute standards are required Up to now, scales of density and intensity of visual events have been related to existing buildings in the vicinity of the new addition. If the scale of redevelopment is so large as to comprise a semi-autonomous sub-system, then existing physical reference points may not be available. In this case some standards are required which are absolutes, relating to the human mind and its preferred rate of perception. This is a formidable study in its own right, and merely superficial observations can be made in the space of an article. Perception studies have proposed that all individuals have an optimum perceptual rate, and that the consensus rate falls within quite a narrow band of variation. So, despite the Built Environment December 1972 635</page><page sequence="4">infinite variety of human personality, the ability to perceive and process differences and nov3lty in the environment is surprisingly constant. Relating this to environment, the density and intensity of visual events should be such as to sustain psychological interest at a given speed of movement. The rate of perception being constant, the density and intensity of events must depend on the speed of movement. Some urban systems are designed as static sets, to be perceived from one point. In such a case, density and intensity can be at their highest. As yet a density which is calculated to sustain interest is a matter of opinion. One day perhaps psychologists will give us a definite scale of reference. At the present time it is sufficient for all involved in the environment business to accept that the built milieu should sustain interest relative to speed of movement. The standard endictment against new urban architecture is that it bores. The bit of Westminster round new New Scotland Yard is ample evidence for the prosecution. If it were all in scale with psychological require- ments for the sustaining of interest at walking pace, this area would be entirely different in character - more like the Smithsons' little bit of London around the Economist offices. The cynics among planners claim that all of this is of little consequence, since people hardly see their environment, especially after a period of habituation. Studies in subliminal perception suggest that this may be super- ficially true, but that seeing is not the same as perceiving. Particularly when movement is goal-orientated, people see very little of the environment, but perception carries on un- abated. Evidence from the neuro-sciences proposes that perception is not dependent upon con- sciousness. Norman Dixon of University College, London, proposes that "at an early preconscious stage in cerebral processing incoming information actually makes contact with memory systems, thereby activating conceptual associates to the applied stimulus . . . sensory information can be received, classified and responded to without ever becoming conscious." Environment is a most subtle manipulator of mood and demeanor; it makes impact upon the mind at many different levels. Apprecia- tion of visual interest is not the monopoly of conscious mentation. It is becoming clear that the more the mind is engaged in depth in the process of perception, the more it is receiving its own form of nourishment. Finally, development control should be con- ceived as a really positive operation. Under- lying every evaluation made by development controllers should be the intention to maximise the quality of each bit of built environment subjectto change. It might be argued that this is a responsibility properly ascribed to architects. Maybe the architect is subject to commercial pressures which compromise his design sensibility. Even worse, the sensibility may be absent. The development controller can become a critical filter, sifting out all but those additions to towns and cities which maximise each redevelopment situation. This way planners will play a positive and not a predominantly negative role. This last point is most important. Much of the quality of older King's Parade, Cambridge. This hypothetical redevelopment highlights the dilemma of the modern aesthetic, but many architects fail to see this as a problem towns and cities is not the result of talent in global planning but skill in contingent optimisation. Places of real quality examplify the principle that each time a redevelopment opportunity occurred the potential for visual excitement so released was fully exploited. Spaces were opened up, new vistas dis- closed, fragments of distant architectural climaxes revealed. The gradual optimisation of the Piazza of San Marco is a perfect instance. Piccadilly Circus may not be San Marco, but it is one of the best things London has got, and the redevelopment of the area should maximise its potential. To summarise These five points may help to establish a creative starting point for development control : 1 A holistic view of built environment and an appreciation of the interactive quality of buildings; 2 Consistency between old and new in density of visual events ; 3 Constancy of in tensity of visual events; 4 Density and intensity of visual events should be related to the human preference to operate near the optimum perceptual rate, relative to speed of movement where there are no contiguous reference points. 5 All of which should be geared to the principle of contingent optimisation - the up- grading of the wider urban fabric with each new insertion. In a crowded island, indeed a crowded Europe, development control is essential. Those who perform this function have one of the hardest jobs imaginable: to require from architects and their clients new standards of urban excellence which will help to heal the breach between man and city. 636 Built Environment December 1972</page></plain_text>
