<plain_text><page sequence="1">Assembling a theological inventory of African religion prompts questions of scholarly goals CONCEPTS OF GOD IN AFRICA. By John S. Mbiti. New York: Praeger Pub- lishers, Inc., 1970. Whoever has already perused one of Mbiti's earlier works on African religion and thought will not be surprised at the encyclopedic inven- tory approach he takes in this work. A wide range of monographs have been consulted, en- abling him to reconstruct the beliefs held con- cerning God, and the associated customs prac- ticed, in many African tribes (as he calls them). This type of scholarship of course has the po- tential of opening a door to the concrete rich- ness of religious studies. Alternatively, it can be- come a monotonous and sterile exercise reflect- ing little more than the compiler's file card sys- tem. Mbiti is responsible here for a mixture of the two effects, and the overall success of the book is accordingly mixed. In a few passages Mbiti departs from the rath- er stultifying inventory approach to demonstrate the original and insightful explications of re- ligious custom and belief of which he is capable. His penchant for theology in preference to litur- gics makes those sections on belief and belief sys- tems more satisfying than those on worship and the overall infusion of life with religious content. As the book is outlined, this means that the first part on "The Nature of God" is the most satisfy- ing, while what follows-part two, "The Active Attributes of God," three, "Anthropomorphic and Natural Attributes of God," and four, "God and Man"-are less so. One of the best, and possibly central, pas- sages in the work, in this reviewer's estimation, is the discussion of two coupled concepts in Afri- can belief: the transcendence and the immanence of God. Here Mbiti emerges from behind the ethnographic detail to resolve the paradoxical (African) conceptualization of a God at once distant (transcendent) and intervening and in- volved in the affairs of men (immanent). God, for many Africans, argues Mbiti, is thus both far and near. This accounts for God being simul- taneously seen as "good" yet "bad" or dangerous as well. As Mbiti puts it, "God is in theory transcendent, but in practice immanent." Although nowhere explicitly stated, Mbiti's as- sumption seems plainly to be that African beliefs</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 263 and tenets on God have a kind of pan-African underlying uniformity and coherence. This emerges in his occasional original statements in the book. That he does not pursue more fully these enticing single sentences is unfortunate. In fact, we cannot be sure that beliefs and cus- toms are as general even throughout a single "tribe" as Mbiti's account might lead us to sup- pose. As it stands, the narrative of the book rarely goes beyond a piecemeal summary of "tribal belief." The reader is again and again expected to believe that X custom is practiced, or Y belief held by Z tribe-without any focus suggested in time or place. When one examines the sources of these statements, it becomes clear that often a given "tribe" is represented by a sin- gle writer, usually one who knew the people early in the colonial period. For every such stated tribe- wide custom and belief there must surely be as many exceptions. For example, Mbiti asserts of the Bakongo that "with jubilation, the Bacongo say, 'Rejoice, God never wrongs one,' and attribute nothing evil to him" (p. 34). Perhaps someone once told this to Claridge before he published his Wild Bush Tribes of Tropical Africa in 1922. But I have heard exactly the opposite-that God does do people wrong to punish for moral shortcom- ings-from other Bakongo two generations later. The point here is not to bicker over ethnographic details, since the contradictory content of both statements makes them invalid, but to point out the need for a more systematic approach to the study of religious experience. Most of Mbiti's generalizations on the Bacongo are consequently not just too narrow, they are arbitrary and wrong because they are lifted out of the narrow context in which they originally applied and given universality. One can imagine that the same critique holds true for most religious cus- toms represented in the book-except for those in which Mbiti has done more systematic re- search himself, or where he relies on masterpieces in the literature. It is a pity that a capable scholar is so handi- capped by faulty method. But it is an injustice to African scholarship that the editors of so repu- table a publishing house as Praeger promote vol- ume after volume of this kind of material. JOHN M.
