The Gazette was founded by John M. Coulter, an outstanding taxonomist and morphologist who expanded the scope of the publication and guided its development into a modern scientific journal. Emphasizing dynamic rather than purely descriptive investigations, Botanical Gazette presents results of original work in all aspects of plant sciences, particularly development, physiology, enzymology, evolution, cell biology, genetics, ecology, systematics, and paleobotany.

Smith November 1977 xvi+388pp., £16.00/ $31 .25 0.12.650850.X Detailed knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the regulation of enzyme synthesis and activity is essential for a clear understanding of the development and behaviour of multi-cellular organisms. Although the shape, function and activities of all organisms are determined by the genetic information encoded within the nuclear and organellar DNA, the enzymes and structural proteins are responsible for the expression of this genetic information. It is the organized regulation of the formation, degradation and activity of enzymes and structural proteins, both in time and space, which induces the development of the physiological properties and of the cellular and organic structure of the organism. Here, the challenging theoretical opportunities and the daunting technical problem inherent in the exploration of this area with regard to plants are examined. The first half of the book outlines present knowledge of enzyme synthesis and activity in higher plants, while the second half is devoted to the various technical methods currently available for the study of enzymes in plants. The fact that this book discusses the theoretical problems of enzyme regulation in higher plants in conjunction with the newly developed techniques for solving these problems will enhance its value for those involved in research into plant biochemistry. It will also prove useful, as a reference source, not only to specialist plant biochemists, but also to botanists, molecular and cell biologists, agricultural scientists, organic chemists and phytochemists.

Yet plants and animals can make no use of elemental nitrogen by themselves. They rely on certain bacteria and algae which fix nitrogen in a combined form that they can then use as a nutrient. Thus it is essential that scientists striving to increase the world food supply understand how nitrogen is fixed by these vital organisms and the methods used to make it generally available. This present book, a record of the proceedings of the Second International Symposium on Nitrogen Fixation, presents comprehensive and up-to-date coverage of the topic. It contains invited papers reporting the most recent advances in the chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, enzymology, genetics and agronomy of nitrogen-fixing systems. In addition, for each subject area, a synthesis lecture is published in which a distinguished contributor to the field surveys and brings together the advances made since the first such symposium held in the USA in 1974. This multidisciplinary work will appeal to a wide range of scientists - botanists, biochemists, chemists, agronomists, plant physiologists and food scientists - and should engender a cross-fertilisation of ideas between these various disciplines.

Seaward School of Environmental Science, University of Bradford Bradford, England December 1977 x + 550pp. £23.00/$44.90 0.12.634350.0 There has been a considerable expansion in lichenological studies in recent years, but a critical appraisal of the ecological and geographical aspects of this important subject is long overdue. This book brings together much of the current knowledge on lichens in relation to the physical and biological components of their environment. Lichens have specific ecological requirements and respond critically to environmental changes thus proving valuable as indicator species. More recently their applicability in assessing the effects of anthropomorphic factors, especially air pollution, has been fully recognised. Lichens play varying roles in pioneer, transition and climax ecosystems. They also provide an important contribution to the basic diet of many animals, and form complex associations with invertebrates and other plants. These and other aspects of lichen ecology, including conservation and their geographic distribution in several major regions of the world, are covered in the present work. The approach of each contributor differs considerably, but most chapters incorporate review material with interpretation and original data. This book will therefore prove an invaluable reference source for lichenologists, ecologists, environmentalists and biogeographers. Contents Mark R. D. Seaward: Introduction. William A.

B. Harborne Department of Botany , The University of Reading, Reading, England November 1977, xii + 244pp. £7.00/$13.65 0.12.324663.6 The last decade has witnessed the growth of a new interdisciplinary subject - ecological biochemistry - concerned with the biochemistry of plant and animal interactions. This is the first textbook to be written in England on the subject and provides a synthesis of information that could previously be obtained only from many scattered sources. Yet, as Dr. Miriam Rothschild stresses in her Foreword, the book is no ordinary work of reference but is an imaginative presentation "richly flavoured with (Jeffrey Harborne's) own original ideas and lucid interpretations. " The book concentrates on the interactions between organisms - between mammals, insects, plants and micro-organisms - as they occur in the natural environment. It also deals at length with the products of secondary metabolism, such as alkaloids, flavonoids and terpenoids, their toxic properties and their ecological functions. Among topics that are discussed and illustrated in the animal world are mammalian and insect pheromones, animal defense systems and insect juvenile hormones; and in the plant world, biochemical adaptations, pollination ecology and plant toxins. Plant-animal interactions reviewed include those between milkweed and Danaid butterflies; pine trees and bark beetles; and cacti and fruit flies. The book is based on a course taught by the author over a number of years. It has been planned so that it is suitable for second or third year University teaching in departments of botany, biochemistry and biological sciences. Its interdisciplinary content will ensure that it is particularly useful to those Universities which offer combined Honours degrees in botany and zoology. It is also intended as a general introduction to all those interested in the dramatic and striking developments that have taken place in ecological biochemistry over the last ten years.

Smith Department of Applied Microbiology , University of Strathclyde, Glasgow , Scotland and John A. Pateman Institute of Genetics, University of Glasgow , Glasgow , Scotland November 1977, x + 552pp. £1 2. 00/ $2 3. 50 0.1 2.650960.3 The papers contained in this volume, originally presented at the Symposium held in Birmingham in 1976 under the auspices of the British Mycological Society, provide not only the latest information available in all areas of current Aspergillus research, but also an integrated review of the various facets of these studies. The genus Aspergillus is remarkable for the wide range of the research areas to which it is relevant, all of which are discussed in this volume; these include industrial microbiology, biodeterioration, genetics, food production, mycoses and mycotoxicoses. A fuller understanding of the factors which regulate growth and development in the Aspergilli would therefore be of major importance and relevance not only to fundamental studies on differentiation in eukaryotes, but also to specific industrial processes utilizing these organisms. The articles include several on various aspects of metabolism and genetic regulation in A. nidulans , which provide a unique coverage, both comprehensive and up to date, of the important recent advances in these areas. The particular facility of A. nidulans for studies of the regulation of gene expression in a simple eukaryote is a key theme in these contributions. Other articles, such as those on mitochondrial and population genetics, give an authoritative and exciting preview of research in progress in hitherto neglected areas of Aspergillus genetics. The comprehensive nature of this volume will enhance its reference value for teachers and researchers in the fields of biochemistry, genetics, plant sciences and microbiology. It will also be of great relevance to industrial microbiologists and food scientists.
