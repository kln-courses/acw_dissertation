EVERS Department of Archaeology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg ABSTRACT Excavations at the Lydenburg Heads site are described. The site is securely dated to the early sixth century A.D. The ceramics belong to a single component and are placed within the first phase of the Lydenburg Early Iron Age. The affinities of the Lydenburg Early Iron Age are discussed and it is concluded that it belongs to a second group of Early Iron Age immigrants who arrived in South Africa during the fifth century. The findspot of the heads was relocated and additional pieces were re- covered. Contextual evidence suggest that they had been placed in a specially dug pit close to the centre of the site, but their relative position to huts or kraals is unknown. Finds of pieces of heads from other sites shows that the heads are not unique, but their placement within pits and the likelihood of there being only one set of heads on a site means that they will seldom be found. Introduction The Lydenburg Heads site, 2530 AB4 (formerly Sterkspruit 66/72), was discovered in 1962 by L. von Bezing. He made a surface collection of terracotta heads, pottery, shell, copper and iron beads and fragments of worked bone and ivory which he gave to the University of Cape Town (Von Bezing &amp; Inskeep 1966; Inskeep &amp; Maggs 1975). A late 5th century A.D. radio- carbon date was obtained on charcoal apparently associated with the pottery (Inskeep 1971). Excavations and a geomor- phological study were conducted over a period of nine weeks between 1974 and 1978 by the University of the Witwaters- rand. The main objectives were to provide context for the heads, to obtain further material for radiocarbon dates, to en- large the pottery sample, to provide evidence for the subsis- tence economy and finally to locate the original findspots of the heads and the small finds of the University of Cape Town col- lection. Von Bezing visited the excavations and was able to re- locate most of the findspots. Site description and geomorphology The site is located on the north facing slopes of the Sterk- spruit valley, at 1462-1432 m, about 5 km southeast of Lyden- burg, 25'06'20"S; 30'29'40"E (Fig. 1). The site is about 270 m in diameter and is bordered by streams on the northern and eastern sides, a diabase dyke on the west and Late Iron Age terraces on the southern side (Fig. 2). The area south and west of the donga has been cultivated in recent times. The village horizon has been eroded away in the southern half where the only remaining archaeological deposits are in truncated pits. A profile in a furrow bank shows that at the northern end of the site there is 1-2 m of hillwash overburden and this is the only area that could contain an intact village horizon. The central portion of the site has been heavily dissected by a donga with three side branches. Twenty profiles (1-19,21) were cut in the sides of this donga and another (20) above the donga to de- termine erosional history in this part of the site. The profiles and soil samples taken from them were examined by Dr M.E. Marker (unpublished report). Only two of these, 1 and 14, showed contemporary or post occupation erosion and deposi- tion; the remainder showed entire residual profiles or duplex or double duplex characteristics indicating cyclical erosion and deposition prior to the Iron Age. The upper portions of profiles 1 and 14 in the eastern branch of the donga developed at the same time as or after the Early Iron Age occupation, since weathered Iron Age pottery and daga were found at a depth of 130 27E K 5000 LYOENBUR- STE RKSPRUIT 25?08'S 2530AB4 0 2 keahnsberg 1ifants R.

The eastern branch of the donga probably developed along the interface between a channel fill and the residual soils. The channel fill post-dates the Early Iron Age occupation and its presence im- plies that during the occupation there must have been a small stream running slightly east of the present donga channel. The entire residual profiles indicated that a village horizon could be expected between the eastern and central branches of the donga. However the top 10-15 cm contained Iron Age material in secondary context above the truncated pits. The site was divided by a two tier grid system: a 30 x 30 m grid labelled with capital letters and Roman numerals (eg KVII, LIX) and a 2 x 2 m grid within each large square labelled with lower case letters and arabic numerals (c10, diS). Any locality on site therefore could be designated by reference to these two (eg NIXd1O), JVIIIf6). The origin point was always in the northwest corner and proceeded south for nu- merals and east for letters (Fig. 2). Surface collection All cultural material except large stones was collected in squares LIX, MIX, and NIX. All finds including stones were plotted in the 2 m squares. Finds comprised MSA-like stone *Received January 1981, revised October 1981. S. Afr. archaeol.

Twenty-se- ven and a half squares were excavated totalling 110 mi2. Exca- vations were done in 50 mm spits until features were en- countered except one (pit 9-MVII f2/g2) which was dug as a single unit. All pits were treated as single units for the purpose of stratigraphy and analysis. The heads area was dug in 2-300 mm spits. In the eastern portion, columns M and N, archaeological re- mains occurred as secondarily deposited material on the surface or in truncated pits dug into a hard red-brown sandy loam which rested directly on a shale and quartzite bedrock. A pediment of boulders covered much of the surface. A typical profile was that of Pit 2 (NIXdlO) (Fig. 3). In the rest of the site the most complete stratigraphy came from the excavations at JV1112, m2-m5 (Fig. 4:10): 0-100 or 150 mm grey brown clay containing secondarily deposited sherds and bone. 150 - 880 mm truncated pits in 12 and m3 had been dug into sterile grey-brown clay. At other localities pits were noted within the first spit (50 mm) and extended down to 700mm (Fig. 3,4). Features Pits. Twelve pits were excavated (Table 2). There were three pit fill types. The first was found in pits 1 and 2 (Fig. 3). The upper portion of the fill consisted of boulders (pit 1) and daga and boulders in a red-brown loam. Below this was a red loam generally free of daga or stones. The basal deposits were a khaki ash of varying depth. Charcoal collected in the trench from a depth of 450-650 mm in pit 1 was radiocarbon dated to 1410 + 50 B.P. (540 + 50 A.D.) (Pta-1634). The pit fill found in pits 5-7, 9, was possibly a truncated version of the first (Fig. 4). The upper portion of the pit con- tained a red-brown loam, the lower portion khaki ash. Finds were variably placed. Thus in pit 9 pottery, bone and charcoal were found throughout and Achatina, iron and copper beads in the red loam; in pits 6 and 7 pottery was found on the contact between the ash and the loam and in pit 7 nearly all the bone was found in the ash. Von Bezing found the beads in the Cape Town collection on the surface around pit 9. The second pit fill type was found in pits 4, 8 and 10 and consisted of khaki ash. Finds were evenly distributed. Von Bezing collected the charcoal for the original date from the site (Pta-328 A.D. 490 + 50) from the surface very near pit 8; the charcoal could have eroded from the pit.</page><page sequence="3">18 The South African Archaeological Bulletin 90 cm 0 150 cm E w 01 t 2 90 bedrock cm t' daga v charcoal 9 stone e slag E pottery &lt;rbone Fig. 3. Sections of pits 1 and 2. The third pit fill was very difficult to distinguish from the surrounding earth and the shape of the pit was determined by the distribution of finds. Pits 3 and 11 were of this type. At pit 3, however, there was a slight difference in the texture of the deposit and roots had grown preferentially at the interface be- tween the fill and the surrounding earth. This allowed us to re- construct the form of the pit accurately. Table 2. 2530 AB 4 Dimensions of pits.

The feature com- prised a large heap of daga, nearly complete vessels and large stones. Below this was the outline of a shallow pit with vertical sides which contained pottery, stones and crushed bone. A small gulley ran through the square and so rainwater could have eroded nearly all the earth into which the pit had been dug. The daga, stones and pottery were in large pieces and would have resisted large scale movements. The heads area JVIIIf6, f7, g6, g7) (Fig. 5). Von Bezing re- identified the original findspot of the heads as the south-eastern quarter of square JVIIIf7. A gulley ran along the western half of g7 and on the line separating f6 and g6. The lower part of this gulley contained large stones and had silted up. Excava- tions showed no trace of archaeological remains in f7 apart from two or three plain small sherds and two decorated sherds on the surface. Nearly everything found came from the gulley and upstream of the stones and was in derived context (Fig. 5). Finds included sherds, some of which were decorated and which were parts of the heads, and five bone lozenges. Other excavations (LIXJ11, LIXk3, LIXn12, LIXn11, oll, MIXn9, MVIIf9, JIXo5, JVIIm2, m4, m5) all revealed objects which had been derived.

The remainder had scattered sherds, daga or metalworking debris scattered through about 50-150 mm of deposit. Finds Pottery All the pottery from the Lydenburg Heads site in the collec- tions of the University of the Witwatersrand and the University of Cape Town was analysed. The 158 reconstructable vessels were classified using a multi-dimensional procedure compris- ing two profile modes, five layouts and seven decoration motif modes based on variation observed in the sample. There were seventy possible combinations of modes of which fifteen were observed (Table 3). A further 434 rims and decorated sherds were analysed according to the decoration motifs found on them and the placement on the vessel profile. Profiles (Fig. 6). Mode 1 Recurved jar. A relatively tall vessel with an S-shaped profile. There were three variations: Total (A) a jar with strongly everted rim and a globular body 55 (B) as for (A) but the body was carinated 3 (C) a jar with a vertical, slightly sloping or slightly everted neck 65 Table 3: 2530 AB 4 Pottery vessel classes.

Mode B - comprised two separated single bands (Fig. 7B) Mode C - comprised a single band below which was a spaced motif (Fig. 7C). Mode D - single bands found alone (Fig. 7D). Mode E - multiple band motifs (Fig. 7E). Mode F - multiple horizontal lines, with or without superimposed chevrons (Fig. 7F). Mode G - spaced motifs (Fig. 7G). Classes (Table III, Fig. 8-15) Classes were formed by the intersection of three modes, one from each of the above dimensions. Class 1: Pl(A),Ll,DA recurved jar decorated on the rim and shoulder with a single band on the rim and a spaced motif and a second single band on the shoulder (Fig. 8:1-3). Class 2: Pl(A),L1,DB recurved jar decorated on the rim and lower shoulder with single bands. One jar was the carinated variety B (Fig. 8:4-6). Class 3: Pl(A),Ll,DC recurved jar decorated on the rim with a single band and on the shoulder with a spaced motif (Fig. 9,10,11:1). Class 4: P1(A),L2,DD recurved jar decorated on the rim with a single band and on the shoulder with a spaced motif (Fig. 11:3-5). Class 5: P1(B),L3,DD recurved jar decorated on the body with a single band (Fig. 11:2). Class 6: P1(C),L4,DD recurved jar decorated in the neck with a single band (Fig. 12). Class 7: P1(C),L4,DE recurved jar decorated in the neck with multiple bands (Fig. 13). Class 8: P1(A/C),L4,DF recurved jar decorated in the neck with multiple horizontal lines with or with- out a superimposed chevron (Fig. 14:1-5). Class 9: P1(C),LO plain undecorated recurved jars. One was of variety A (Fig. 14:6-7). Class 10: P1(A),L2,DD bowl with a single band just below the mouth (Fig. 15:1-2). Class 11: P2(B),L2, DE bowl with multiple bands just below the mouth (Fig. 15:3). Class 12: P2(A),L2,DF bowl with multiple horizontal lines with superimposed chevron just below the mouth (Fig. 15:4). Class 13: P2(B),L3,DD bowl with single band on the body. One bowl was variety A (Fig. 15:5). Class 14: P2(A/B),LO plain bowls (Fig. 15:6-7). Class 15: P1(C),L4,G recurved jar with a spaced motif on the neck (Fig. 15:8). Analysis of sherds (Tables 4,5). Sherds were analysed by deco- ration motif and part of the vessel. The latter included rim, neck, shoulder, below carination, and undifferentiated body. The decoration motifs were divided into four groups: I. single bands (Fig. 16:1) II. multiple broadline incision, chevrons and triangles (Fig. 16:11). III. multiple bands (Fig. 16:111). IV. discontinuous motifs (Fig. 16:IV). Any sherds which could not be allocated reliably to any of these groups were recorded as having traces only. The analysis al- lowed comparison with the classes previously established and many of the sherds could then be assigned to classes, or to groups of classes (eg all neck or rim and neck sherds bearing multiple band motifs could be assigned to class 7; all rims with single band decoration and all discontinuous motifs could be assigned to the group comprising classes 1-4) (Table 5).</page><page sequence="8">The South African Archaeological Bulletin 23 Fig. 8.

Single bevelled rims are those which present a single flat face outwards and below the lip when orientated correctly. Rounded rims were found on all profiles, single bevels were found with all forms of profile 1. Decoration technique. Motifs were produced by incision (bold or broadline) or by stabs or punctates. These techniques were used in isolation or in combination (Table 6). The Heads The Heads were fully described and illustrated by Inskeep and Maggs (1975: figs. 7-14). An examination of the seven heads showed that there were five categories that could be used to classify the remains excavated: I neck - multiple bands of hatching and cross hatching on the neck with a plain rim band (Fig. 17 I). II hair - areas of cross-hatching and hatching (Fig. 17 II). III face edge, ears, eyes, nose, mouth - plain moulded strips (Fig. 17 III). IV sacrification marks - incised moulded strips (Fig. 17 IV). V hair on the larger heads - moulded knobs (Fig. 17 V). In addition there were areas of the heads which were not de- corated. All categories were found in the excavations (Table 7). Two pieces from JVIIIf6 and one piece from JVIIIg6 0-3 cm both of category II (hair), fit onto the back of the second, unre- stored, larger head, demonstrating conclusively that the frag- ments came from the original heads. All pieces recovered in the excavation were very small. Other ceramics Two sherds with ground edges were found, one from pit 3, the other from the surface in square MIXd12. There were eight discs with chamfered edges, all of which were found on the surface. Their diameters varied between 20 and 40 mm. There was a roll of unfired clay from pit 1. This measured 79 mm long and was 33-39 mm in diameter. A piece of wall daga from pit 2 contained a sherd with a horizontally pierced lug. Wall daga Two substantial samples were excavated in pits 2 and 12. The unweathered examples from pit 2 were studied. The matrix was a sandy clay mixed with cow dung, the structure of which could clearly be seen in some examples. The daga bore impressions of relatively stout upright poles and thinner trans- verse withies. Poles varied in diameter from 10-40 mm and were either round or had been squared off. They were set an average of 22 mm apart, varying between 6-45 mm. The inner face of the daga was smooth and the outer face bore grass im- pressions. It is uncertain whether the form-of the hut was a cone and cylinder or a beehive. Metalworking The waste products of metalworking were scattered over large areas of the site and were found in some of the pits. Slag was the most common find and varied in size between small frag- ments with a mass of only a few grams to large heavy chunks with a mass of up to 500 g. Slag found in pits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 showed that metalworking was done during the occupation of the site. Six small fragments of tuyeres were found. Only one from pit 1 gave any information on dimensions, and it had a minimum perforation diameter of 42 mm. All fragments had been highly fired in a semi reducing atmosphere (the matrix was grey to black on the exterior and red inside) and three had a glassy surface on the outside. One piece of haematite with a mass of 200 g was found in pit 1. Table 6.

The beads were made of strips of copper bent to form a circle. The strips were 3 mm wide and had a maximum diameter of 7-9 mm, and were between 1-2 mm thick. There were four iron beads. One came from pit 5, a second from pit 9 and the other two from the surface immediately around pit 9. They were severely corroded and therefore could not be measured. They were made in the same way as the copper beads. The six or seven iron beads in the University of Cape Town collection (Inskeep &amp; Maggs 1975: fig. 15e) were found on the surface near pit 9. The other two iron pieces were fragments of rods or pins. One, from pit 4, was 15 mm long and had a circular section. The other, from pit 2, had a square section and was 34 mm long. Glass beads One bead, a small pink oblate, was found on the surface of JVIIIf7. A portion of a blue-green translucent snapped bead 7 mm long was found on the surface of LIXj11. Stone artefacts A small fragment of a vessel made of schist was found on the surface in square HVI. The three fragments of schist vessels in the University of Cape Town collection came from the vicinity of pits 4 and 5 (around LIXm1). Two complete querns and fragments of two others were found on the surface. The two complete ones were found in MIXc5 and the two fragments in LIXn1 and MIXo4. The grinding area took the form of a groove which measured 164 x 64 mm in one example and 230 x 74 mm in the other. The latter had a maximum depth of 50 mm. There were no upper grind- stones.

Further halves of stones which had been perforated by pecking came from MIXc5 and pit 3 (Fig. 18:4). A large mortar in two halves was found on the surface of HIXh8. It was made in a weathered diabase boulder (Fig. 17:1). Three other examples were known from the site. There were two complete examples in the garden of the owner of the site which came from about H/JIV; and there was a broken double example in shale in the south east portion of MVI. Other items included a fragment of weathered diabase smoothed on both faces with a rounded edge and perforated twice on the broken side from LIX12 (Fig. 18:3). A bored stone in weathered diabase, convex at one end and concave at the other was found on the site by the owner. Two bead smoothing stones were found on the surface. One was in quartzite with a single groove 64 mm long, 8 mm wide and 4 mm deep. The other was in diabase and had a single groove 64 mm long, 8 mm wide and 2 mm deep (Fig. 18:2). Bone and shell artefacts Achatina shell beads were found in three localities: pits 4, 5 and 9 and the surface immediately surrounding pit 9, the bulk coming from pit 9. They were sorted according to size (Table 8).

The eighteen bone and ivory lozenges (Inskeep &amp; Maggs 1975: fig. 15b) in the University of Cape Town collection were similar and were also found with the heads. The fragments of worked ivory in the University of Cape Town collection (Inskeep &amp; Maggs 1975: fig. 15d) came from near pit 8 (MVIIo8). Fauna Mrs E.A. Voigt (Transvaal Museum) identified the fauna (Ap- pendix I). The sample was dominated by domestic stock, in- cluding cattle. Two bones gave definite indications that sheep were present. Both the domestic and wild components of the assemblage included a large proportion of juvenile animals. Among the domestic stock this presumably indicated culling preferences. The Bovid II remains were probably sheep/goat, the Bovid III remains were probably cattle. The only Bovid I tentatively identified was Sylvicapra, the rest of the Bovid I re- mains could have come from the same animal. The small carni- yore, mouse-sized rodents and small mammal could not be identified more closely.</page><page sequence="13">28 The South African Archaeological Bulletin Human remains Six skull fragments, probably negro, were found in JVIIm5 in hillwash deposits and were described by Professor H. de Villiers (Appendix II). The state of the bone was the same as that of animal bone found in pits in this part of the site and the remains should, therefore, be contemporary with the site. Discussion Before we can place the Lydenburg heads site in its cultural context we must demonstrate that the pottery belongs to a single assemblage and that the heads, which were not directly associated with any pottery, form part of that same assem- blage. The only way to demonstrate that the pottery belonged to a single entity was to examine the coincidence of vessel and sherd classes in pits, the only primary context. Some vessel classes (5,11,12,15) were represented only in the surface collec- tion. In the analysis of vessels the two main groups of jars (classes 1-4 and 6-8) were nearly mutually exclusive (Table 10), Table 10: 2530 AB 4 Pottery classes and features (vessels only) Pits other Class Surface 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 excava- Total tions 1 1 1 1 1 4 2 1 1 2 4 3 4 2 5 1 1 2 1 16 4 14 1 1 1 1 3 4 5 30 5 1 1 6 16 2 2 3 3 26 7 13 1 1 1 4 20 8 11 1 12 9 5 1 1 1 3 11 10 1 1 1 3 11 1 1 1 2 1 1 13 8 1 1 1 11 14 10 1 1 1 2 1 1 17 15 1 1 Totals 88 4 9 4 3 3 1 5 2 7 9 2 7 14 158 occurring together only in pit 5. However when the sherd analysis was combined with the vessel count (Table 11), the two groups were shown to be found together in 7 of the 12 pits, demonstrating that they were part of the same assemblage. Inskeep and Maggs (1975) pointed out that the fabrics of the pottery and the heads were identical. The fabric in turn differs from that of pottery found on the nearby Late Iron Age stone walled settlements. There are in addition several stylistic features which are common to the heads and the pottery from the site. The bands of decoration on the neck of the heads close- ly resemble the multiple bands on pottery Class 7 (Fig. 13) even to the sub-relief, rope-like texture found on the two large heads and some of the pots. The scarification marks on the face have parallels in notched raised bosses found on the bellies of two vessels one of which was found in pit 5 (Fig. 16:IV:8). The form of cross hatching on the heads is found often on the pots (compare Figs. 11:4; 12:2). Thus in terms of fabric and stylistic features the heads and the pottery can be seen to belong to the same ceramic tradition and the two can be regarded as associated on the site. The pottery from the Lydenburg heads site dated to the sixth century is similar to that from five other excavated sites in the eastern Transvaal: the.seventh-ninth century site Doornkop 2530AB5 (Berrington et al. n.d.), seventh century Plaston 2531AC1 (Evers 1977; Evers &amp; Vogel 1980), ninth century Klingbeil (Evers 1980; Evers &amp; Vogel 1980) and two undated, Table 11: 2530 AB 4 Pottery classes and features (vessels and sherds).

A presence/absence analysis of modal classes (Table 12) showed that all the sites except Klingbeil showed close links with the Lydenburg heads site. Klingbeil is consider- ably later and probably belongs to a second phase (Evers 1980). The other sites probably belong to the same first phase of which the Lydenburg heads site is the earliest site known. The phase apparently spans the fifth to seventh centuries (two dates from Doornkop are later and are probably associated with a Kling- beil phase component on the site). The pottery from these sites near Lydenburg forms part of a larger cluster. While comparisons with Broederstroom (Mason 1973, 1974) are not yet possible, several authors have shown that Lydenburg pottery has strong links with that of the Natal Early Iron Age, in particular Msuluzi ('NC3') and Ntshekane (Maggs 1973, 1980b; Inskeep &amp; Maggs 1975; Maggs &amp; Michael 1976; Evers 1977, 1980, 1981; Huffman 1978; Hall &amp; Vogel 1980). While the presence of a Lydenburg-Natal cluster in the period 500-900 AD is not disputed, the origin of the cluster is. Huffman (1978, 1979) has placed it in Phillipson's western stream implying it has a common origin with Kalundu, Kapwirimbwe, Sinoia and Bambata, and that it represents a second movement of Early Iron Age people into South Africa. Maggs (Inskeep &amp; Maggs 1975; Maggs 1977, 1980ab) has argued that it can be derived out of Matola. Maggs' argument is centered on Natal and hinges on the rare presence at Mzonjani of attributes common on Msuluzi pottery. So far no sites have been found which date to between the fourth and sixth centuries A.D., during which period the transformation would have to have taken place. However, the very close similarity between Msuluzi and Lydenburg must mean that they have a common origin. Matola ceramics are known from Matola IV (Da Cruz e Silva 1976), Enkwazini (Hall &amp; Vogel 1978; Hall 1980), Silver Leaves (Klapwijk 1974), Eiland (Evers 1975, 1981), Harmony (Evers 1979) and Castle Cavern (Dart &amp; Beaumont 1969; Huffman 1978). While the dates for Enkwazini, Silver Leaves and Eiland are in the third and fourth centuries, those for Castle Cavern are in the fifth century. With P. Beaumont's permission I examined the Castle Cavern ceramics with T.N. Huffman in 1977 and found them to be the same as the third and fourth century Matola materials from the other sites. Matola ceramics as a whole are very different from those of the Lydenburg cluster or Gokomere (Huffman 1978: table 6). Maggs's own work demonstrates this as well. He pointed out that there are major differences between Mzonjani and the later Msuluzi which affected the analysis of Mzonjani ceramics to the extent that most of the attributes had to be changed (Maggs 1980a). He admits (Maggs 1980b) that it is possible that Msuluzi represents the introduction of a new ceramic style but prefers to derive Msuluzi out of Mzonjani. Lydenberg cluster sites in the eastern Transvaal also show few common features with Matola. Matola sites share three out of twenty modal</page><page sequence="14">The South African Archaeological Bulletin 29 Table 12.

The three Matola classes shared with Lydenburg are also far more restricted in variety than the Lydenburg ones. The class correspondence is therefore only partial. The Lydenburg cluster and Matola must therefore belong to two different traditions. Matola, it is commonly agreed, has strong links with East African material principally Kwale and belongs in Phillipson's (1977) eastern stream. Huffman (1978, 1979) has suggested that the Lydenburg cluster and Bambata form part of Phillipson's western stream. While this is attractive and is almost certainly correct, it has its own problems. The first of these relates to the nature and small size of the Bambata sample. We need a single component open-air Bambata site with a large sample of ceramics which will show conclusively that Bambata is separate from Gokomere and part of a Bam- bata-Lydenburg stepped continuum. Secondly the placing of Bambata and Lydenburg into the western stream implies mi- gration through Zambia. So far the dates from Zambian sites are fourth and fifth century, apart from some enigmatic early dates for the very small Situmpa sample. These Zambian dates are later than the, 250-350 A._D. estimated dates, for the first ap- locate the findspot of the heads and to discover in what context they had been deposited. The findspot was relocated with the help of Von Bezing but the context was more difficult to estab- lish. Von Bezing (pers. comm.) indicated that they were found in a heap with a surface area a little greater than one square metre. The findspot was situated next to a feeder channel for the central branch of the donga (Figs 1, 5). The amount of ero- sion is difficult to determine. Pit 12, however, is situated in a very similar context in the same type of matrix with the distri- bution of finds in a heap and there only about 100 mm of the original pit depth was preserved. It is, therefore, possible that at the time of discovery the majority of the pit containing the heads had been destroyed by erosion leaving the contents in a heap. Erosion of this magnitude (800-1000 mm in 1 500 years) is not unusual (B. Moon pers. comm.). The remainder of the pit outline could well have been destroyed after the heads had been collected in 1962. If the heads were found in a pit it then becomes necessary to examine the context of that pit within the layout of the site. The area surrounding the heads findspot was almost devoid of surface finds and it thus cannot be shown whether the heads pit was close to huts, to a stockpen or even in an empty space. It was, however, well within the settlement area. The settlement layout of the Lydenburg heads site was also not retrievable ow- ing to the erosion of large portions of the village. The positive evidence we do have is the presence of pits and some informa- tion on the distribution of daga and slag. A Spearman's Rank analysis (Table 1) gave a significant negative correlation be- tween slag and daga suggesting that metalworking was done away from houses. One would expect this anyway but the sit- uation is actually more complex. Some of the daga concentra- tion, on excavation, proved to derive from pits, and slag in small pieces is highly mobile so the distribution cannot be re- garded as primary. The distribution of slag and daga cannot, therefore, reliably reflect the distribution of huts and metal- working on the site. The excavated pits were not excavated in a way which would demonstrate whether they were randomly distributed or whether they were grouped. Evidence from the Early Iron Age sites shows that they occur both in groups (eg Clark 1974; Vogel 1975; Berrington et al. n.d. and my own ex- cavations at Langdraai and Klipspruit) and also scattered among daga concentrations probably relating to huts and grainbins (Vogel 1975; Berrington et al n.d.). Only two published sites give any indication of the organiza- tion of space within an Early Iron Age site. At Kumadzulo Vo- gel (1971) found huts in blocks 3,5 and 6. These blocks were lo- cated in an arc round an extensive midden which was not exca- vated. At Kabondo Kumbo Vogel (1975: fig. 2) found a con- centration of pits surrounded by one or two arcs of daga con- centrations which may represent huts and grainbins. They had isolated pits with them. To one side and partially overlying some pits were two areas of slag. In both cases there is an ar- rangement or an arc of huts around a central area which in one case was a midden, in the other a group of pits. More recently excavations at Langdraai 2530AB24 have pro- vided further information. I found two concentrations of a yel- low ashy deposit which were probably dung accumulations in cattle kraals. They were located about 60 m apart. Excavations carried out downslope of one of them uncovered several pits in- dicating that there was probably a pit group at this point. Scat- tered pieces of daga from hut walls were found in an arc to one side of the kraal deposit. We have therefore potentially a simi- lar arrangement to Kumadzulo and Kabondo Kumbo, but the Langdraai site is large measuring approximately 300 x 400 m and the presence of two kraal deposits within 60 m of each oth- er implies that the village was made up of a number of units comprising huts, kraal and pits. The Lydenburg Heads site is slightly smaller than Langdraai and was presumably organized in a similar fashion. Since we have no direct evidence for the layout of the Lyden- burg Heads site and the exact context of the heads pit in rela- tion to other features is no longer available, we must look at the contents of the heads pit and other pits to determine whether they are similar or different. All other pits on the site contained</page><page sequence="15">30 The South African Archaeological Bulletin the remains of domestic and/or industrial refuse: hut daga, slag, stones, pottery including almost complete and complete vessels, animal bone, food waste, small fragments of iron, and beads of shell or metal. By contrast the heads pit appears only to have contained the heads and the bone lozenges. This must indicate that the pit in which they were found was specially dug to contain them. The reasons for this can be seen in the na- ture of the heads. They are certainly symbolic objects. The theriomorphic head with the same scarification marks, hair and neck treat- ment as the anthropomorphic heads indicates this. Their use is more problematical. Inskeep and Maggs (1975) have argued that they cannot have been used either as masks or as head- pieces owing to their dimensions and their fragility. They sug- gest that they were perhaps fixed to posts while in use and that the bone lozenges formed part of the decoration of the whole ensemble. They further suggest that they may have been used in initiation ceremonies. Figures which are used in initiation ceremonies are not generally permanently on display. Inskeep and Maggs mention examples from ethnography where figures are destroyed after ceremonies; there are other examples (eg Roberts 1915) where the figures are hidden, to be brought out only at the next ceremony. Initiation is certainly the most likely occasion for their use. Their being placed in a pit points to their being kept hidden when not in use and this in turn suggests, with the contrast in contents with other pits, that the pit was specially dug to contain them. This is probably about as far as it is safe to go under the present circumstances. The heads are no longer unique. Fragments of the neck and the top piece figurine of a large head have been recovered from a site on the farm Panorama, near Kiepersol, east of Sabi (L. Milne pers. comm.). Unfortunately these were found during construction operations and the context, and probably frag- ments are now lost. At Langdraai 2530AB24 three sherds have been recovered with moulded decoration similar to the mould- ed hair on the large heads. These were found in a plough zone and are therefore also out of context. These finds show that we should expect to find heads on other sites. However if they are connected with initiation it is unlikely that there will be more than one set at a site and their placement in a pit means that they are not going to be found easily, especially if the large size of some of these Early Iron Age sites is taken into account.

Voigt Department of Archaeozoology, Transvaal Museum, Pretoria Introduction The faunal material was sorted by the excavator and identi- fiable material submitted to the Transvaal Museum for exami- nation. The sample was small (122 specimens) and had to be kept separated into ten distinct archaeological units (Table 1). Table 2 and 3 give the resultant species lists.

Species present The sample is dominated by bovids. Fifteen of the 26 identi- fied bovids belong to two domestic species. The seven Bov. II and Bov. III specimens may have been from Ovis/Capra or B. taurus respectively but were only identifiable on the basis of fragmentary post-cranial remains. The minimum numbers given in Table 2 have been adjusted so as to take this possibility into consideration. Sylvicapra grimmia is the commonest small bovid species on most Transvaal Iron Age sites. It is very possible that the Bov. I post-cranial remains also belonged to this species. The carnivore remains present in MVII 012 (ii) are interest- ing in that they consist of most of the skeleton of a juvenile indi- vidual. Enough of the skeleton is present to suggest internment of an almost complete carcass. Similar situations have been re- corded from Zerrissene in South West Africa/Namibia and Cape St. Francis (Voigt 1978:181-3), although the Zerrissene material included only some of the limb bones. In both the above cases the material belonged to domestic dogs. The Lyd- enburg material belongs to a small, immature carnivore about the size of a mongoose. The rodent and reptile/amphibian remains may be fortui- tous, but the dassie remains are most likely to have been food remains. Economic activities and diet It is of great interest to note the high proportion of the Ovis/Capra group at the Lydenburg site. The proportion of this group in relation to Bos taurus is 11:4 (or 15:7 if the Bov. II and Bov. III specimens are included). Thus on this very early Iron Age site small stock were being herded and were being heavily utilized for food. These figures represent 156,8 kg of meat from 11 Ovis/Capra specimens and 846,0 kg from four B. taurus specimens. The yield from the small stock is low because six of the specimens are juveniles. The age at death of the domestic animals is given in Table 4; the age classes used are those proposed by Voigt (1978 op.cit). Only two of the B. taurus specimens can be aged; one is very young and one is a mature animal. The Ovis/Capra sample is characterized by young animals; the oldest class is not repre- sented. This is not the pattern which is found elsewhere, al- though this is a small sample on which to base any far-ranging conclusions. However the number of juveniles may reflect a Table 2. 2530 AB4 Species List: Minimum numbers of individuals SPECIES NIXd10 LIX13 LIXk2 JVII12 JVIIM3 JVIIM2, MVIIn8 MVII012i MVII012ii MVIIg2 TOTAL pit 2 pit 4 pit 5 pit 11 pit 10 4 and 5 pit 6 pit 7 pit 9 Small carnivore i 1 Procavia sp. 1 1 c.f.

With regard to butchering techniques, it is interesting to note that the well-preserved B. taurus frontal from LIXk2 had its horns chopped off during the butchering process. This is a characteristic of cattle material from most Iron Age sites and is apparently a butchering technique with a long history. Conclusions It has been postulated by the author and by other workers that Early Iron Age communities would be likely to depend heavily on wild sources of animal protein. The Lydenburg sample directly contradicts this hypothesis and indicates a need to re-think the situation in the first few centuries of the Iron Age. The pattern at Lydenburg is very similar indeed to that from the seventh century A.D. Msuluzi Confluence site in Natal (Maggs 1980) where the faunal sample is also dominated by domestic bovids, with the Ovis/Capra group predominat- ing. Of interest is the fact that five of the ten specimens belong- ing to this group were younger than ten months (Voigt 1980). The Nanga site in Zambia dates partly from the same period and provides us with an alternative model. The fauna from the Early Iron Age phase of that site is dominated by Bos taurus with only a few Ovis/Capra specimens (Plug 1979). More faunal samples from Early Iron Age sites are urgently needed to define the range of variability of the economic basis. Such samples are becoming available; in a few years' time we will have a much better understanding of the inter-relation- ships between Man and the animals in the Early Iron Age.

Sphenoid (left) comprising portion of body and base of greater wing including the formina rotundum and ovale. Parietal (right), 2 fragments 1) including portion of sagittal suture and parietal foramen; 2) including portion of the fronto- parietal suture. These fragments represent a single human individual. The remains are too fragmentary to permit an accurate as- sessment of age at death, sex and population group. However, the small mastoid process and the slight development of the tympanic plate of the temporal bone are suggestive of a female. The moderate curvature of the parietal fragment is indicative of a Southern African Negro rather than of a Khoisanoid. The ossification of the bones represented is complete and thus the individual represented was fully adult.</page></plain_text>
