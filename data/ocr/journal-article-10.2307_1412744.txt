Most interesting, perhaps, is the third chapter on the development of the singing instinct in its various forms. He then treats other courtship phenomena-drumming, tumbling, play- ing, mock fighting, etc. Finally, he discusses the development and significance of the courting instinct and the relations between reflexes, instinct and play, and ends with a good nomenclature. Les Arts et Mdtiers chez les Animaux, par H. COUPIN. Nony &amp; Cie, Paris, 1902. pp. 422. This ingenious and industrious writer has collected from many sources accounts of the industries of animals, which he classifies as masons, potters, weavers, paper makers, cotton makers, mound build- ers, road and bridge makers, sewers, wax moulders, rosin makers, tapisers, miners, basket makers, wheel makers, confectioners, cigar makers, hammock makers, comb maKers, spinners, architects of houses of amusement, carpenters, hut builders, ditch makers, stone borers, etc. La Logique chez 1' Enfant et sa Culture, par FRED;RIC QUEYRAT. F. Alcan, Paris, I902. pp. I57. This naturally follows the two earlier works of the author on "Im- agination and its varieties in children " and "Abstraction and its r61e in education." First comes the logic of images with examples seen in their comparisons and the construction of phrases and propositions, personification and anthropomorphism. Analogical reasoning is thus the first type. Child sophisms are classified under induction (mainly those of insufficient data, errors concerning causes and sophisms of accidence) and deduction or a begging question, and ignorance of the subject and vicious circle. The chief faults of children might be characterized as due to credulity, candor, naYvete, folly, precipitation, prejudgment, irreflection, sentiment and imagination. The last chap- ter praises the importance of rational training. Der Selbstmord im kindlichen Lebensalter, von A. BAER. G. Thieme, Leipzig, I90I. pp. 84. A member of the council of public hygiene in Berlin here ably sums up the history of the statistics of suicide of youth in France, Italy, an(l especially Germany, and draws therefrom important lessons. He holds that the chief cause is not to be found in the school, although he would relieve it from over pressure and especially from the worry of examina- tions, to which some cases especially in the lower schools can be directly traced. The chief cause to him is precocity or the premature develop- ment of an adult sense of responsibility, altruism or knowledge, and finds it most frequent in the lowest and in the highest stages of society, or better among the poorest and the richest strata of society. Of twenty- five interesting cases, he has himself made a special study. It is ex- tremely desirable to have data on this subject collected with the same care for Anglo-Saxon races. The Four Temperaments in Children. Their Appearance and Treat- ment in Rearing and in the School. As Appendix: The Tempera- ment of Parents and Teachers. By BERNHARD HELLWIG. J. Esser, Paderborn. pp. 79. This is an interesting characterization of each of the four phrenologi- cal types of childhood-the sanguine, choleric, melancholic, and phlegmatic. The treatment proper to each type is considered, and there is an appendix on the temperament of parents and teachers. Whatever we may think of phrenology, this book is of much interest and value. 322</page><page sequence="2">Mental Gtowth and Control, by NATHAN OPPENHEIM.

The writer discusses in successive chapters-the growth of character; mind as a machine; the power of attention; what association means; the uses of instinct; memory and its development; the bonds of habit; hyp- notism and suggestion; imagination, the enlightener; the emotions and their education; reasoning, the guide; will, the controller. Les CaractUres, par FR. PAUIHAN. F. Alcan, Paris, I902. pp. 247. The author here shows the different manifestations which abstract laws produce in different psychic types. His conception is new and personal, and he holds that the study of forms of character is attached to abstract psychology. He undertakes to classify individual types. The first edition of this work was long since exhausted, and here vari- ous objections are met. Einleitung in die theoretische Biologie, von J. REINKE. G. Paetel, Berlin, go90. pp. 638. In the first section, the author treats of the relations between biolo- gy and philosophy; in the second, he discusses necessity in biological events; in the third, the forces and laws that work in organisms; then elementary organisms, heredity, and voluntarism and the mechanico- psychic view of life.

He then addresses himself to his theme, and treats father and child, polyandry, the levirate and the niyoga, inheritance by brothers, nomenclatures, exogamy, endogamy, marriage and its development, family, tribe and clan. Some First Steps in Human Progress, by FREDERICK STARR. Chau- tauqua Assembly, New York, I90g. pp. 263.

A Complete Exposd of Eddyism, or Christian Science and the Plain Truth in Plain Terms Regarding Mary Baker G. Eddy, Founder of Christian Science, by FREDERICK W. PEABODY. An address delivered at Tremont Temple, Boston, August I, I90o. pp. 68. The author was the counsel in a recent widely reported trial involv- ing the principles of Christian Science. He deserves great credit, both for his fearlessness, for the vigor of his investigations, and for print- ing this very frank and lucid book, which all interested in the subject should read. Lewis G.

Then follow the metaphysics, morals, traditions, sociology, etc., of occultism. A Syllabus of Psychology, by H. HEATH BAWDEN. Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, N. Y., I902. pp. 109. This little manual endeavors to utilize the results of experimental and genetic methods, but the writer is principally interested in the larger aspects of the problem. To our thinking, the author has not escaped the danger of all abbreviated treatments and is somewhat too abstract for pupils of the age inten(led. The genetic aspect is very in- adequately treated, and there is no evidence in the volume that the author is familiar with its literature. Ophthalmic Myology, a Systematic Treatise on the Ocular Muscles, by G. C. SAVAGE. Gospel Advocate Publishing Co., Nashville, Tenn., 1902. pp. 589. This compendious work, with sixty-one illustrative cuts and six plates, opens with a chapter on the fundamental principles of ocular motions, which will interest every working psychologist. It states in terms, often new and always clear, the law governing the recti and the obliques, innervatious, the law of rotation to vertical and horizontal fixed planes of the head, the law of corresponding retinal points, the law of direction to individual muscle and its plane of rotation, with suggestive figures.

Typical Modern Conceptions of God or the Absolute of German Roman- tic Idealism and of English Evolutionary Agnosticism, with a Constructive Essay, by JOSEPH A. LEIGHTON. Longmans, Green and Co., New York, I90I. pp. I90. This work originated in a Cornell thesis seven years ago. The orig- inal paper dealt only with Fichte and Hegel. Here Schleiermacher and Spencer are added. Each have a chapter, and in the fifth the author sums up his own conclusions. The absolute is the experienced unity of will and thought. 324</page></plain_text>
