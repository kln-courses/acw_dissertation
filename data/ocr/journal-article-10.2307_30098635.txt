Brussels : Desclee de Brouwer. 1954 THE " demythologizing " of the New Testament, which the great Marburg scholar Dr Bultmann has been offering the world, is an effort to re-state the Christian event in terms ac300table to the scientific temper and existentialist philosophy of the modern mind. Myth, for Dr Bultmann, is not merely legend of the miraculous, or naive cosmology, but every rationalism, from Moses to Aristotle, which presents the relations of God and man in con300tual analogies. The omnipotence and spirituality of God, for instance, are to him as anthropomorphic and therefore as mythical as the theophany of Sinai or the transfiguration. The only categories which remain valid are the existentialist. The message of the New Testament will be the recognition of the tragic, helpless absurdity of existence, as Heidegger analyses it, plus the specifically Christian thing, that God notifies in Christ his offer of rescue. This is Christianity, and not mere philosophy, because it is through Christ that we realize the inexorable urgency of committing ourselves to the very impotence of our existence and of expecting an " authentic " existence not from one's own effort, as philosophy might assume, but from the abandon ment of faith. Christ, preaching radical surrender to God, and himself undergoing the last absurdity of death, is the objective notification of our helplessness and God's salvation. To the many critics of Dr Bultmann who have found in his " demy thologized " Christianity a purely subjective event in the individual soul to which Christ is in the long run irrelevant, or no more relevant than any other human tragedy, like the atom-bomb on Hiroshima, Fr Malevez opposes an " objectivist " interpretation of Dr Bultmann's effort. The Christian event did really take place, once and for all, in the life of Jesus of Nazareth, which therefore has a unique significance, at once historical and historic if we may hazard this translation of Dr Bultmann's geschichtlich and historisch. This would to some extent justify his claim to be "determinedly Christian " and not merely existentialist. This base assured, Fr Malevez can then oppose Dr Bultmann to himself: if he recognizes some action of God in Christ, or at least some special message of God in Christ, has he not re-admitted the " myth " of divine intervention in history, or rather, found in existentialism an exigency for the basic categories of traditional Christianity and thereby justified it once more for the modern mind Few more penetrating analyses than Fr Malevez's have appeared in the course of the long and wide-spread debate which Dr Bultmann's theology has given rise to. He admits that some " extremely confused " texts and a " fundamental imprecision " in his subject's thought have given ample ground for less sympathetic criticism. His own clarification of the issues is a welcome contribution to a debate, which though carried on mostly by Protestant</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 231 scholars, is of great interest to Catholics. To them, of course, it is not news that Christianity cannot be " demythologized " in the manner of the liberal scholars, whose precipitate of Christianity is condemned by Dr Bultmann as a humanism which offers only the false security of human values. But apparently this still needs to be said, and Catholics must be grateful for the vigour of the learned critic's affirmation, as, incidentally, for much clear sighted exegesis which will do much to sweep away traditional prejudice from a long conflict. His incorruptible sincerity is always refreshing and illumi nating, and Fr Malevez does him full justice, ex300t perhaps in one place, where he attributes to Dr Bultmann the crude confusion which would reduce that fine mind to the level of some recent lectures of the B.B.C. Third Pro gramme that the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus is a gnostic hellenistic myth. In his major exegetical work, Die Theologie des Neuen Testaments, Dr Bultmann expressly recognizes that the death and resurrection of Jesus, and also their redemptive significance, were constitutive in the most primitive Jerusalem preaching of the apostles, and have no relation, of depend ence or similarity, with any non-Christian religions. Dr Bultmann does not explain the origin of the central Christian conviction : consistently enough, since he undertakes to " demythologize " the New Testament, not merely in answer to the demands of " modern science," but, most precisely, in answer to the demands of " faith " itself : to supply it with a documented foundation would be, in his system, to evacuate it. Fr Malevez touches only lightly upon this, which is a pity, because it is surely here that Dr Bultmann's determination to remain a Christian must be tested. The value of the crucifixion appears to him in the light of an existentialist analysis of the crucifixion itself : but to Christians, only in the light of the resurrection.
