<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christine helmer (ed.), Biblical Interpretation: History, Context, and Reality (SBLSymS 26; Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2005). Pp. xii + 181. $24.95. This volume comprises the proceedings of the Biblical Theology Group of the Soci- ety of Biblical Literature international meeting in Berlin in July 2002. Helmer's assertion that the "central question tying together all the contributions is the question concerning the relationship between philosophy and biblical interpretation" (p. 9) is almost broad enough to capture a piece of each essay. The contents are divided into two parts. Part 1, "Historical and Theological Interpre- tation," contains three papers on early Jewish and Christian biblical interpretation: Maren Niehoff ("New Garments for a Biblical Joseph" [pp. 33-56]) examines how Philo and Josephus create midrash around the Joseph cycle: Philo as a way of encouraging a certain</page><page sequence="2">860 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 69,2007 ethos in Alexandria's Jewish community, Josephus in an attempt to create a personal apolo- gia for his actions during and after the Jewish War. Harold Attridge's insightful "Heracleon and John: Reasessment of an Early Christian Hermeneutical Debate" (pp. 57-72) reassesses Heracleon's theology in light of Ansgar Wucherpfennig's study of the fragments (Hera- cleon Philologus: Gnostische Johannesexegese im zweiten Jahrhundert [WUNT 142; Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2002]). Attridge agrees with Wucherpfennig that Heracleon must be studied first through the fragments, and not through Origen's characterizations. With this perspective, Heracleon appears less a Valentinian manipulator than a competent philolo- gus , well versed in Alexandrian philosophical exegesis. "Heracleon does no more violence to the text of John's Prologue than does Origen" (p. 71). He is simply devoted to "a more exalted view of the Logos" within the Platonic scheme, and a Platonic anthropology tem- pered by Aristotelian views, "insisting that the essential relationship of God to God's chil- dren is one of potentiality" (p. 67) - that is, people can change. Karen Jo Torjeson's equally insightful "The Enscripturation of Philosophy: The Incorporeal ity of God in Origen's Exe- gesis" (pp. 73-84) examines Origen's method of "enscripturation," that is, how Origen uses allegory to transform Scripture into philosophy, or vice versa. Origen shared with Gnostic theologians the concern to speak of God in Middle Platonism's nonanthropomorphizing terms. Rather than rejecting the anthropomorphic language of his scriptural tradition, he transformed it by means of allegory and thus found a middle way between those who rejected Plato for the Bible and those who rejected the Bible for Plato. Also in this section is Bernd Janowski's "Biblische Theologie Heute: Formale und Materiale Aspekte" (pp. 17-32), which has no discernible connection to the other three essays. Janowski very briefly surveys where the field of biblical theology has been, where it is headed, and its central animating question. This is the question Gerhard von Rad posed fifty years ago: how to understand the diversity of the Bible as a kind of unity, so as "ein 'Verständnis der Bibel im ganzen' zu fördern" (p. 25; quoting von Rad, Theologie des alten Testaments [2 vols.; Munich: Kaiser, 1957] 2. 88). But is this still the question? In a Europe where secularization has emptied the churches of congregants and the Bible has become a relic of ancient history, might there not be a more basic question: Are there valid truth claims to make about any part the Bible at all? The essays in part 2, "Philosophical Interpretation," cohere nicely as studies in nineteenth-century efforts to interpret biblical texts in terms of the philosophical discus- sions of post-Enlightenment Europe. Stephen Grätzel 's engaging "Verkündigung in Über- einstimmung mit Vernunft: Fichtes Auslegung des Johannesevangeliums" (pp. 103-12), addresses what will be to biblical scholars a little-known chapter of Johann Gottlieb Fichte's work, his interpretation of John's Prologue. This essay helpfully reveals some of the philosophical scaffolding connecting later existential theologians - Rudolf Bultmann in particular - with their Kantian roots. Christine Helmer ("The Consummation of Reality: Soteriological Metaphysics in Schleiermacher's Interpretation ofColossians 1:15-20" [pp. 1 13-32]) argues the relatively fine point that Friedrich Schleiermacher is not guilty of impos- ing his own theological predilections (his alleged "christological bias") on the text, but he still "overdetermines" the text by assuming the transhistorical nature of his own soterio- logical metaphysics, which overpowers the Logos theology of the text itself. The problem, in other words, is not theological, but metaphysical. In "Die Dialektik von Freiheit und Sünde" (pp. 133-40), Joachim Ringleben explores G. W. F. Hegel's interpretation of Gen-</page><page sequence="3">COLLECTED ESSAYS 861 esis 3 as mythus , which yields a profound, speculative philosophical understanding of human freedom. Wilhelm Gräb ("Anerkannte Kontingenz: Schelling's existentiale Interpretation des Johannesprologs in der Philosophie der Offenbarung " [pp. 141-54]) explores the bib- lical underpinnings of another nineteenth-century Idealist, arguing that F. W. J. Schelling's concept of revelation derives from his interpretation of John's prologue. In John's Christ, God is revealed as both transcendent (the Logos) and immanent (became flesh), and there- fore also always contingent (historical). These four quite technical essays will require much from the biblical scholar who spends little time in the nineteenth century. In the section's final essay, "Feuerbach and the Hermeneutics of Imagination" (pp. 155-63), Garrett Green attempts by a deconstructive sleight of hand to harness the role of imagination in Ludwig Feuerbach's analysis of religion to serve a kind of postmodern Barthianism, which sees imagination as "the medium but not the source of its knowledge of God" (p. 161). Feuerbach, he says, can be credited with identifying the imaginative character of religion; he just did not understand the nature and role of imagination properly. But this seems beside the point - that is, the important point that divides their thought and gives two clear alter- native accounts of religion: God exists entirely extra nos or entirely in nobis , that is, merely in our imagination. The first essay in this section, Marvin Sweeney's "The Democratization of Messian- ism in Modern Jewish Thought" (pp. 87-102), treats an entirely different topic. It is a fas- cinating account of the roots of the modern Jewish notion that all Jews - not a supernatural individual - share "the divinely-ordained responsibility to work for the sanctification of the entire world of creation" (p. 91), which he finds in the sixteenth-century Kabbalist Isaac Luria, the eighteenth-century philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, and the modern Zionist Asher Ginzberg. All of these, he argues, and modern Judaism's democratized understand- ing of messianism are heirs to the democratizing messianic concept of Isaiah, especially Isa 55:3. This is an essay well suited to the classroom, where interest in Tikkun Olam will be rewarded with an account of its historic roots. These essays, taken individually, offer a number of fine studies. Specialists who find one or another of these contributions via some search engine will no doubt be pleased with their discovery. But the volume, as a whole, is too disparate to serve any clear purpose. Stephen J. Patterson, Eden Theological Seminary, St. Louis, MO 63119</page></plain_text>
