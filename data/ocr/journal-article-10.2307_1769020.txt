<plain_text><page sequence="1">A NOTE ON CAMUS AND THE AMERICAN NOVEL PHILIP THODY PROFESSOR Harry R. Garvin's article "Camus and the Amer- ican Novel," in Comparative Literature, VII (1956), 194-204, is most stimulating, and offers a tempting explanation for the inferiority of La Peste to L'Etranger as a work of art. It seems to me, however, that the article is based upon two misconceptions which partly invali- date some of Mr. Garvin's conclusions. The first is that the excellence of L'fEtranger is due to a large extent to Camus' adaptation of the tech- niques of the American novel, the second that La Peste is deliberately intended to be a Promethean work of art. On the question of the influence of Hemingway on Camus, Mr. Garvin quotes Jean-Paul Sartre and Henri Peyre, but not Camus him- self. In the enqu?te which Combat conducted into the popularity of the American novel in France, Camus stated that he had adapted Hem- ingway's techniques in L'Etranger because it suited his purpose of de- scribing "un homme sans conscience apparente."l In refusing to allow Meursault to show understanding of the world and of his own mind, Camus used a technique which, as he understood it, had been elaborated by the Americans in order to describe those men who were not conscious of themselves-Lennie, Jake Barnes, etc. This technique was, for him, that of "le roman americain de comportement,"2 and he was imitating not the finely balanced descriptive prose of Hemingway but the rather crude idea of what this prose was like which had been popularized by writers and translators. One of the features of the vogue of the American novel in France was the simplified picture which French critics and writers had of this novel. For them, an American novelist was "brutal, cruel, obscene, peintre sans nuances de personnages simplifies jusqu'a la caricature."3 It is this idea of the American novel that Camus both imitates in L'Etranger and criticizes in L'Homnme revoltt. It reduces man to only one dimension, maintains Camus, and denies him-as he himself denied Meursault-all interior life and reality. L'Honime revolte is a book which criticizes excesses in French literary fashion as well as excess- "demesure"-in contemporary politics. In attacking the "tough" school of American fiction, Camus is less concerned with the actual merits of the writers who compose this school than with its general aesthetics 1 Combat, for Jan. 17, 1947. 2 Preface of the Pleiade edition of the (Enuvres completes of Roger Martin du Gard (1955), p. vii. 3 Jean Blanzat in Le Figaro litterairc, June 12, 1947; review of the translation of F rskine Caldwell's Trouble in July.

His attack upon its over- simplifications is similar to his criticism of the deification by the sur- realists and others of de Sade, Lautreamont, and Rimbaud as ideal rebels. To me, it seems doubtful whether Camus had a real appreciation of the genuine merits of Hemingway and of other American writers,4 and whether he learned anything from them but the purely external aspects of their prose. The careful planning of L'Etranger, the balance between the first and second parts, the gradual building up of the ten- sion, the alternation of intentionally dull prose with passages highly charged with images, the evocation of the sensations of life in North Africa, the irony of Meursault's comments, his dry humor and incor- ruptible honesty all seem to me to come from elsewhere. Camus' ex- perience of the theater taught him the importance of building up ten- sion; and he had already at hand in Voltaire and Merimee a literary tra- dition from which, if he had not learned to "extend meanings by impli- cation and to make comments unobtrusively,"5 he had at least acquired a sense of the importance of quiet irony. Meursault's simplicity and directness of mind, as well as his acute awareness of sights, sounds, and smells, are already foreshadowed in Camus' early essays, L'Envers et l'endroit and Noces. Lastly, his use of the passe compose throughout the novel, creating, as it does, the sense of the discontinuity of Meur- sault's experience, is not a result of the influence of Hemingway, since in the French translations of Hemingway's novels the narrative tense employed is the passe simple. This important factor in the technique of the novel is an original creation on Camus' part. It is always difficult to establish the exact degree of influence of one writer upon another, and in many cases the writer himself would probably be unable to define it exactly. I would suggest, however, that Camus' own remark about his use of Hemingway's style should keep us from assuming that L'Etranner owes too large a debt to The Sun Also Rises.6 Mr. Garvin is entirely right, I think, to say that L'Etranger is a minor classic because Camus is writing within certain defined limits and be- cause, like Hemingway, he is not being overambitious. Mr. Garvin is right also, I think, to insist upon the impossibility of major tragic art in the present century-at least in the medium of the novel. Where I would differ is in his excessive criticism of La Peste, considered as an 4 It is interesting to compare what he said about them-that their art rapidly leads to an impasse-with his praise in the same article for Hawthorne and Mel- ville. Camus has also written an enthusiastic study of Melville, praising him both as an artist and as a thinker. 5 Garvin, loc. cit., p. 195. 6 A full treatment of this question is to be found in J. Cruikshank, "Camus' Technique in L'Etranger," French Studies, X, (1956), 241-254.

It is true that La Peste takes up many of the themes of La Re- marque sur la Revolte and that Rieux and Tarrou are unsatisfying as characters partly because they are prototypes of Camus' ideal philo- sophical rebel. I would disagree, however, with the assumption that La Peste is printarily intended to express these ideas of revolt, and that its comparative failure as a novel comes from too great a metaphysical ambition. La Peste is a description of the German occupation of France in the terms of the allegory of a modern city invaded and isolated by plague. Part of it was written and published under the occupation.7 While many of its themes do recall Camus' philosophical ideas-the plague is abstraction, justifying legalized murder; it manifests the absurd and can be fought against only by moderation and tolerance-it is an allegory in the form of a realistic novel. By that I mean that the de- tails of Camus' description evoke another set of circumstances not di- rectly described. (The rats dying on the pavements are not only the real forerunners of actual plague8 but also the signs of the coming catastrophe which Oran, like the Europe of the 1930s, chooses to ignore until it is too late. The imposition of quarantine is also the separation brought about by German occupation, the "equipes sani- taires" are the Resistance movement, etc., etc.) It is on this much less ambitious plane that La Peste was, in my opinion, conceived and writ- ten, and should therefore be judged. If it is considered as an account of a plague in the city of Oran and an allegory of the German occupa- tion-which is what it is intended to be-then it is far more satisfying both as a work of art and as the expression of certain ideas. The main characters in the book are not Rieux and Tarrou but the Plague and the Town. It is almost a collectivist novel, in which groups of people and abstractions are more important than individuals. If the construction of the novel is any guide to its meaning, its whole theme is the overwhelming of individuals by abstraction, the temporary domi- nance of this abstraction, and the gradual return to the world of the individual. The first part of the book contains minute descriptions of personal actions, indicated by the frequency of verbs-"Le matin du seize avril le docteur Bernard Rieux sortit de son cabinet et buta sur un rat mort au milieu du palier. Sur le moment il ecarta la bete sans y prendre garde et descendit l'escalier"-as well as portraits of the town in an ironic and already semicollectivist style. As the plague becomes more powerful and dominates the town, the style itself reflects the absolute power of evil abstraction. Even in the occasional scenes in the center of the novel which are highlighted for the purposes of Camus' 7 The first analysis of the feeling of exile, "Les Exiles dans La Peste," appeared in the Swiss magazine Domnaine franCais in 1943, pp. 35-45. 8 See Black's Medical Dictionary, 19th ed.

In this scene, the plague is described with a wealth of images which makes it clear that it dominates the events described as it dominates the whole town. If it is true that, as Sartre said, the technique of a novelist always implies a metaphysic,9 then Camus' tech- nique in La Peste reflects one central idea-that abstraction can domi- nate a civilization and render individuals both unimportant and im- potent. No indication is given in La Peste that either Rieux's action as a doctor or Tarrou's organization of the "equipes sanitaires" has any effect upon the course which it pleases the plague to take. If La Peste is read as a novel of ideas, it is, as Mr. Garvin says, "theme ridden, contrived."10 What is more, as soon as the work is studied as a novel of ideas, its many weaknesses come to light. The atti- tude which Camnus advocates is effective only in the particular circum- stances of real plague, and loses much of its value as soon as resistance is considered not as a fight against impersonal germs but against other men. Moreover, the closing sentence, for all the poetry of its threat, " . . . la peste reveillerait ses rats et les enverrait mourir dans les rues d'une cite heureuse," hints at an acceptance of the inevitability of evil and a refusal to do anything which would prevent the return of another plague. (As, for example, dismissing the town sanitary inspector and reorganizing the drainage system-in allegory this could mean much.) The fact that the novel was a less satisfying allegory on the moral than on the physical level was noted by several leading French critics, and La Peste, for all its popularity, did not receive a unanimous critical acclaim for its ideas."l It was, however, much admired as a work of art, and I would suggest that Mr. Garvin finds it unsatisfactory because he expects it to be something which it was not Camus' intention to make it-the novel of Promethean revolt. Camus obviously intended L'JEtranger to be read as the novel of the absurd. Le Mythe de Sisyphc was written at almost the same time, and was published a few months later.12 Meursault's final outburst against the chaplain shows that he had understood before the novel started that "Aucune morale, ni aucun effort ne sont justifiables devant les san- glantes mathematiques qui ordonnent notre condition."l3 While La " Review of the translation of The Soulnd and the Fury, NRF, June and July 1939, pp. 1057-1061 and 147-151; reprinted in Situations I (Paris, 1945), pp. 70-81. 10 Loc. cit.. p. 197. 11 Principal among the reviews which expressed doubts as to the value of the moral attitudes advocated in La Peste were Etiemble, "Peste ou peche," Temps Modernes, No. 26 (1947), pp. 911-920, and Pouillon, ibid., pp. 921-929; J.

In my opinion, La Peste is less important for the ideas which it expresses-and for its characters, although certain of the minor ones like the old man who spat on the cats and the retired draper do stick in the memory-than because in its style, its construction, and the ex- cellence of its allegory it represents the modern myth of impotence and imprisonment. It is highly doubtful whether the novel of revolt, such as it is described in the passage "Revolte et Art" in L'Honmme revolte, will ever consciously be written. Proust did not set out to do what Camus says that he did, and the novel which was intended as the correc- tion of reality by art would, like Grand's, remain unwritten. Camus, in writing L'Etranger, did accept limits; he did not, for example, try to make of this novel all that he said, in Le Mythe de Sisyphe, that "le roman absurde" should be.15 It is my contention that he was equally as conscious of limits in La Peste as he was in L'2Etranger. The reasons for the inferiority of La Peste to L'Etranger as a work of art lie perhaps in the fact that Camus, as his last two publications show,16 is simply more at home in a story told in the first person. This may account for the fact that Tarrou's confession, in addition to being at the center of his thought in La Peste, is the most satisfying extract from the novel from an aesthetic point of view. Thus, in my opinion, the two most important things in Camus' use of Hemingway's technique are these: first that he adapted it to serve a specific purpose, and second that he did not find it sufficiently important to be used twice. La Peste obviously owes nothing to the American novel, and neither does Camus' latest recit, La Chute. L'Exil et le royatume, which is about to appear, is announced as containing short stories written in differing styles-ranging from the interior monologue to simple realistic description-and will clearly be a series of independent exercises in technique. Camus, like the other French novelists who at one time or another adopted an American technique of narration, did so quite deliberately, and abandoned it when it had served its purpose. Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, J.-L. Bory, Robert MIerle, and Louis-Rene Des Forets are all French writters who wrote only one book in an "American" style. After her use in Le Sang des autres (1945) of Faulkner's interior monologue and destruction of normal time sequences-highly reminiscent of The Sound and the Fury- Simone de Beauvoir returned to a far more conventional mode of narration in Tous les honmmes sont mortels (1946). In spite of the fact 14 See my own article, "Albert Camus and La Remarque sur la Revolte," French Studies, X (1956), 335-339. 15 As, for example, "donner au vide ses couleurs," Le Mythe de Sisyphe, p. 154. 16 La Chute, recit (Paris, 1956) ; "L'Esprit confus," NNRF, June 1956, pp. 961- 978 (to appear in L'Exil et le royaume). 247</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE that Les Mandarins (1954) is dedicated to Nelson Algren, the only suggestion of a genuine American influence in the technique of this novel is an extremely informal and rather colloquial prose style. Sartre has not completed his series of Les Chemins de la liberte, but the third volume, La Mort dans I'ame (1949)-as well as the sections of the fourth part, Dr6le d'amitie, which appeared in Les Temps Modernes in 1949-marked a movement away from the extreme simultaneity which was Sartre's principal debt to Dos Passos in Le Sursis. J.-L. Bory won the Prix Goncourt in 1946 with a novel, Mon Village a l'heure allemande, which showed strong influences of Dos Passos and Faulkner. In his next book, however, Cher Aglae (1947), there is only as much "simultaneisme" as is demanded by the subject treated-the life of a country district as seen from the local train-and in Fragile ou le panier d'weufs (1950) there is no recourse to American techniques. Robert Merle seemed to owe much to Hemingway and Steinbeck in Week-end a Zuydcoote (1949), where a simple, vivid, direct, and unanalytical prose style admirably suited his description of war. In his next novel, La Mort est smon .umetier (1952), he changed to a more conventional technique in order to write a biographical and analytical novel. Louis- Rene Des Forets appeared to have been inspired by Faulkner's use of the interior monologue in his Les Mendiants (1943), although in fact he had read only Sanctuary before writing it.17 He said that after writing the first novel he read all Faulkner and was much influenced by him. It is difficult to see how this is really the case, since his next work, Le Menteur (1946), although a triumph of technique, is totally dissimilar to any Faulkner novel. The French novelists of the "metaphysical school"-Sartre, Camus, Simone de Beauvoir-adopted an American technique because it suited the expression of a particular idea on which they were working. Hem- ingway's style suited Camus because it could be used to show a world deprived of its normal anthropomorphic significance. Dos Passos' technique enabled Sartre to express the overpowering influence of con- temporary events upon the life of twentieth-century man, and the in- escapability of our historical situation. Faulkner's interior monologues and disrupted time scheme gave Simone de Beauvoir the opportunity to present the life of the hero of her novel in a series of rapid flashbacks, and thus to show how the idea of responsibility-the theme of Le Sang des autres-had existed at every moment from his childhood onwards. After they had used the techniques to express their ideas, Camus, Sartre, and Simone de Beauvoir altered their style to express different ideas. The same movement away from the American novel can be ob- served in the writers who adopted it to describe particular circum- stances. Marguerite Duras was the only French novelist to be obsessed 17 See Combat, Jan. 4, 1947. 248</page><page sequence="7">CAMUS AND THE AMERICAN NOVEL with the American novel, to the point of imitating Faulkner in La Vie tranquille (1945), Caldwell in Un Barrage contre le Pacifique (1949), and Hemingway in Le Marin de Gibraltar (1952); but her next novel, Le Square (1954), showed a much smaller debt to the Americans, without any falling-off in artistic excellence. It is thus my contention that the inferiority of La Peste to L'Etranger -which, in any case, I find less great than does Mr. Garvin-is not due to the fact that Camus had forgotten what he had learned from the Americans. In common with other writers of his generation he learned some things from the Americans, but he borrowed far more. In study- ing the vogue of the American novel in France it is necessary, I think, to make a very clear distinction between what French critics said about it and what the French novelists who were supposed to have been in- fluenced by it actually did. To judge by some of the remarks made in France between 1944 and 1949, French literature had become a mere offshoot of the American novel. What in fact had happened was that certain French writers were cleverly supplementing their own skill by borrowed techniques. Camus no more owed his success in L'Etranger to Hemingway than he did his "failure" in La Peste to Defoe, or Mel- ville, whose influence he more openly acknowledged.
