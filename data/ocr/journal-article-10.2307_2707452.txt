<plain_text><page sequence="1">SWIFT AND THE WORLD-MAKERS BY ERNEST TuvEsoN During the decade of the 1690's in England the characteristics of the "modern" world were beaten out, as on anvils, in a series of hotly-fought controversies about various subjects in the realm of knowledge. Two of these were the battle of the ancients and moderns, and a conflict of religion and science foreshadowing the later upheavals over Darwinism. It is the connection of these particular controversies which forms the subject of this paper, Swift, appropriately enough, being the point of contact. The essay of Temple that started the great to-do in England about ancients and moderns opens with an indulgent wonder that two learned works, very finely written "in their several Kinds," should have fallen into the common error of maintainiing that mod- ern learning and literature are preferable to the ancient.' One of these works, he says, was "writ by a Divine, and the other by a Gentleman." The latter, of course, was Fontenelle; the former, Thomas Burnet, was soon to become a storm center and the symbol of a movement which had much to do with the formulation of a new viewpoint in several fields. He does not by name figure in The Battle of the Books; but, as I hope to show, he and other repre- sentatives of the movement which he inspired figure in Swift's writing as neither divines nor gentlemen; and an understanding of the issues involved may give us a clearer insight into Swift's mind. In 1681-89, Dr. Thomas Burnet, then Master of the Charter- house, published a work which he called Telluris Theoria Sacra.2 He had been the student of Tillotson and of Cudworth, the asso- ciate of Henry More, an enthusiastic devotee of the work of the Royal Society, and a disciple of Descartes. Out of this back- ground came perhaps the most ambitious attempt of the time to "reconcile" religion and science. It intended to implement with actual, detailed accounts of the earth's history the physico-theo- ' "An Essay upon the Ancient and Modern Learning," in The Works of Sir William Temple, Bart. (London, 1740), I, 151. 2 The first volume, dealing with Paradise and with the Deluge, appeared in the former year; the last one, relating to the burning of the earth and the Millennium, in the latter. The Theory of the Earth, an English version by Burnet, was published 1684-90. 54</page><page sequence="2">SWIFT AND THE WORLD-MAKERS 55 logical theories about the harmony of theology and the new phi- losophy which had already become commonplaces in the writings of More, Boyle, Sprat, Glanvill, and others.3 The Theoria under- took to trace the natural history of the earth as the counterpart- the parallel plot-of the moral history of mankind. The creation, the deluge, and the final consumption by fire of the present earth are the leading events in God's great drama, as Burnet calls it; and all are explained, largely in Cartesian terms, by the operation of natural forces-such as gravity and the law of motion. Al- though he grants that God originally created matter and estab- lished the law of motion, he assumes that the Mosaic account re- fers only to the sublunary world, which assumed shape from a primitive fluid chaos solely through operation of natural forces. The antediluvian earth was a paradise in its inhabitable parts, for there was no obliquity of the ecliptic and hence no variation of sea- sons, the surface of the globe being perfectly smooth and the soil incredibly fertile. The great catastrophe of the plot was the flood, which was caused by a cracking of the earth's surface, so that parts sank into a subterranean "abyss" of waters; when the flood was over, Noah and his family were left to begin all over again, under conditions of "hard"i primitivism, in a world that was now become a "ruin," defaced by mountains, suffering from seasonal variations of temperature, etc. The deluge itself came about through no divine intervention, but only the natural and inescap- able sequence of physical events. In time, again by the operation of physical forces, the earth will be set on fire, something like the Stoic rebirth of nature will take place, and a renovated earth will rise like the phoenix. This naturalistic account of sacred history made a great im- pression in its day.4 "Christian geology" was born. Scientists of reputation paid Burnet the tribute of imitation, for, although they rejected his specific "scientific" explanations, they accepted generally his basic assumptions as to the place of natural law in 3Boyle says that the Christian doctrine and the "corpuscularian" or atomic philosophy is each an "epicycle" of the "great and universal system of God's con- trivances, and makes but a part of the more general theory of things, knowable by the light of nature, improved by the information of the scriptures;" each is part of the "universal hypothesis."

The most important new theory of this kind was that of William Whiston, clergyman-mathe- matician, the successor to Newton as Lucasian professor at Cam- bridge.' Where Burnet had been Cartesian, Whiston was a New- tonian, and much influenced by the early works of Halley on the orbits of comets. Halley, moreover, had attributed to comets a large place in the carrying out of the divine plan, as he had ex- plained in a paper read to the Royal Society in 1694.6 If the sug- gestion came from Halley, however, it was Whiston 's working out the idea in detail, connecting it also with the Millennium instead of restricting it to the deluge (as Halley had done), that got the at- tention of the common man. Whiston, indeed, was something of a Huxley to Newton and Halley; and his sensational explanations of the creation, deluge, and Millennium in terms of comets went a long way to popularize the new celestial mechanics. Thus, while comets lost the aura of mystery which had surrounded them when they had been considered as supernatural omens of dire events, they gained an awesome reputation as the preappointed instruments of eschatology. Whiston reasoned that the earth was originally the "atmos- phere" of a comet. Each "day" of the creation story is actually a year; the whole account is a kind of diary, relating the events as they might have appeared to an observer on the spot rather than giving a true "philosophic" description. Whiston, like Burnet, thought the earth took shape solely as the result of gravitation; and since, following Bentley's Boyle lectures, he thought gravita- tion a continuing direct work of God, he felt confident that his theory would be serviceable to religion.7 Much of the water for 5A New Theory of the Earth (published 1696; quotations are from the 4th ed. [London, 1725].) Whiston, a life-long enthusiast about scientific ideas of the Millennium, is a link between seventeenth-century agitations on the subject and the eighteenth-century theories which influenced the Romantics. 6 See Marian's Eloge de M. Halley, quoted in Correspondence and Papers of Edmond Halley, ed. E. F. MacPike (Oxford, 1932), 25. 7 See Bentley's Works (London, 1838), III, 88. That gravity is an "immediate fiat and finger of God" was widely accepted by the physico-theologians, although Newton cautiously refused to say more than that it cannot be innate in matter (Ibid., p. 212). The effect of such an idea is shown by Whiston, who in effect destroys the meaning of "miracle" by asserting that even the falling of a stone ought "to be esteem'd a supernatural effect, or a Miracle." New Theory, ed. cit., 293. Thus the natural absorbs the supernatural.</page><page sequence="4">SWIFT AND THE WORLD-MAKERS 57 the deluge was furnished by an obliging comet, most probably the one we call "Halley's." The Millennium is to be inaugurated by the fire resulting from the collision of a comet-no doubt the same one, on a return visit-with the earth. But, it is to be noted, God has not sent the comets on special missions to perform miraculous acts; none ever deviates from its set orbit. Whiston's comets ap- pear as ubiquitous and almost as intelligent as angels had been in earlier cosmological systems.8 It is not the detailed theories, as pseudo-science, of these "tworld-makers" who devised histories of the planet from their armchairs, but their preconceptions about the nature of the physi- cal and spiritual worlds that concern us. The vision of the physi- cal, mathematical universe dominates their thinking. It is nobler, they assert, as do the physico-theologians in general, for God to act through great immutable laws than to intervene like a fussy schoolmaster on every petty occasion. This confidence is rein- forced by the new sense of the insignificance of this earth and con- sequently of mankind in the vast expanse of the universe, filled as it probably is with infinite space in which there is an infinite num- ber of inhabited worlds.9 Burnet remarks: if we would have a fair view and right apprehensions of Natural Provi. dence, we must not cut the chains of it too short, by having recourse, with- out necessity, either to the First Cause, in explaining the Origins of things, or to Miracles, in explaining particular effects.10 The world of these theorists is like that of the "great shew, resembling an Opera" described by Fontenelle.1" The drama of human history goes on against the background of scenes produced by the great "Wheels and Weights" of the mechanical universe; and the divine Dramatist is also the Stage Manager who, however, unlike merely human ones, need not constantly oversee his crea- tions; once having made the wheels and weights in certain forms and given them appropriate motion, He may be sure that they will of themselves produce the desired effects at the exactly correct 8Burnet thought a special providence was necessary to save the Ark from destruction. Whiston, with great labor, manages to devise an explanation that makes direct intervention unnecessary even here. 9 See the New Theory, 439. 10 Theory, Part I, 314 (quotations from the 1st ed., Burnet's English version). 11A Discourse of the Plurality of Worlds, tr.

He need only give the whole automaton a kind of sus- taining energy, like the electric current of a motor, without which the wheels would not only stop but fall into a chaos of their com- ponent atoms. When we say the universe of the Enlightenment was a clockwork one, we should remember that it also produced this series of stage effects, and that there was a plot behind it. The eighteenth-century enthusiasm for progress assumes such a conception. But how, one may well ask, were such ideas to be reconciled with the literal sense of Scripture? The tellurists accepted the histor- ical accuracy of the general Biblical account, so far as the events of human history are concerned; that account was still considered to be the most authoritative of all. But natural history was a dif- ferent matter. It was agreed that Moses was giving, not an accu- rate and "philosophic" but merely an educational account of the origin of the universe, a simple and "fabulous" tale, adapted to the weak apprehensions of the ignorant Hebrew tribes. We may appeal to anybody, says Whiston, whether Scripture does not usually speak as an honest and inquisitive Countryman, who no more doubted of the Heavenly Bodies, than of the Clouds appertaining to the Earth, rather than as a new Astronomer, who knew them to be vastly distant from, and to have nothing in a peculiar manner to do with the same.12 Burnet writes that if we are to read Revelation correctly, we must test it by "true principles" of philosophy-viz., that "God made all things in Number, Weight and Measure, which are Geometrical and Mechanical principles."'3 A new era is under way when a serious defender of Christianity says "there is a great difference betwixt Scripture with Philosophy on its side, and Scripture with Philosophy against it."'" Burnet makes clear that it is only the former which we can accept in any sense in the new age of "phi- losophy. " Such conceptions of Scriptural interpretation must be based on an idea as to progress of knowledge. How is it that we can correct the traditional anthropomorphic creation story and smile indul- gently with Moses, we now being in on his august secret, which previous generations failed to understand? The new philosophy 12 New Theory, 21. 13 Theory, 316. 14 A Review of the Theory of the Earth, in the Theory, ed. cit., 46.</page><page sequence="6">SWIFT AND THE WORLD-MAKERS 59 is the answer; but it is no accidental or fortuitous development. We are fortunate enough to live in the age set by God for the great enlightenment. This religious faith, a concept almost of "tprogressive revelation," was by no means new in the 1690's and neither Burnet nor Whiston has any doubt about it: 'Tis reasonable to suppose, that there is a Providence in the conduct of Knowledge; as well as of other affairs on the earth; and that it was not design'd that all the mysteries of Nature and Providence should be plainly and clearly understood throughout all the Ages of the World, but that there is an Order establisht for this as for other things, and certain Periods and seasons. .. 15 Those greater degrees of Knowledge which the Providence of God has in this Age afforded us, make such Opinions intolerable in the present, which were not so in past Centuries.16 The important pioneer naturalist and student of fossils, John Woodward, had (in 1695) advanced yet another theory of the earth, with a compromise which was to become popular."7 He granted that God had brought the deluge upon the earth by special intervention; but the means He used to dissolve the earth were mechanical. This solution of the dilemma, which went back to the sixteenth century, had a positively orthodox ring. The deluge was attributed to great floods of water derived by special providence from the abyss, which so thoroughly confused and dissolved the surface layer of the earth that its aspect was entirely changed. The strata of the earth were deposited when the dissolved mass settled, the heaviest material first, then the next heaviest, etc. What were to become fossils of marine animals were washed far inland.'8 Great interest was shown in these theories, for they combined the themes of popularized science and of religion. Perhaps no means of spreading the ideas of the new science was more popular than this "philosophic" revising of Scripture. At first, Burnet's great undertaking was received with general approbation as well 15 Burnet's Theory, Part I, 286-87. The background of this concept of progress will form part of a study of Burnet's Theory on which the author of this article is engaged. This study will also attempt to show that Burnet is the principal source for the Anglican theories of progress described by R. S. Crane in "Anglican Apolo- geties and the Idea of Progress, 1699-1745," MlIP, 31 (1934), 273-306 and 349-82. 16 Whiston's New Theory, 62.

It appeared that science had, as Boyle hoped, at last become the as- sociate of religion. Cartesianism had not yet been discredited as science, and Burnet's adoption of it had an impressive effect. Both Burnet and Whiston were sincerely orthodox according to their lights, and their pious hope was to confound the " atheist" by proving that an intelligent man, even a fellow of the Royal Society, could comfortably believe in the Scriptures, rightly understood; for, as Whiston says, the usual interpretations of Scriptures have attributed to God such things " as their plainest Reason could not think compatible to a wise Man, much less to the All-wise God."'I9 Both Burnet and Whiston disclaimed any intention of dealing with moral theology. In short, the great Christian tradition of man's history and nature appeared to have been vindicated according to the latest Cartesian or Newtonian theories, whichever one pre- ferred. A strong reaction against Burnet 's hypothesis soon set in. This reaction was greatly intensified by his publication, in 1692, of a treatise entitled Archaeologiae Philosophicae; sive Doetrina Antiqua de Rerum Originibus. Its purpose was to bolster up the theory by showing, in accordance with an old tradition, that the ideas of the antediluvian world and of its downfall were preserved, in corrupted form, among the ancients.20 In addition, Burnet pro- ceeded to re-examine, according to his principle of testing Scrip- ture by "philosophy," the whole account of creation. Probably following the Philonic tradition which included all the events down through the expulsion from the garden of Eden in the creation story, Burnet was confronted with the difficulties involved in ac- cepting the description of the making of man and of his career be- fore the Fall. He was carried beyond natural history, and found himself involved, contrary to his earlier program, in moral theol- ogy. He declared that no philosophic man could accept the story of man's making and of his Fall as literally true. The story was made up by Moses, most likely, to frighten a childish, primitive people into obedience to the moral code promulgated by the great legislator.2' It is, he says, incongruous that the divine Architect's 19 Ibid., 65. 20 For an example of this concept, see Stillingfleet's Origines Sacrae (4th ed., London, 1675), 10ff. 21 Archaeologiae, Foxton translation (London, 1729), I, 26.</page><page sequence="8">SWIFT AND THE WORLD-MAKERS 61 sublime work should be ruined in a "few Hours by so silly a beast as a Serpent;" and he is unable, because of the "philosophic" and literal temper of this age, to find elaborate "moral" and "spiri- tual" allegories underlying the story, as previous commentators from Philo to Henry More had done. Not that Burnet rejected the concept of degeneration in the human race, and the necessity for redemption; but he is a kind of Pelagian, carrying to an extreme tendencies which had for a long time been apparent in the Cam- bridge Platonists and the Latitudinarians, to say nothing of other theologians outside his immediate tradition. That is to say, man's moral degeneration is not a curse upon the race; there is no " orig- inal sin" transmitted by traduction or by contact of the soul with the degrading body. The true degeneration of mankind is to be found in the gradual increase of evil habits and customs, and is something like the moral decay of nations because of "luxury" de- scribed by the classical historians. The function of religion is that of education and government, to set right man's milieu and to point out to him the path of righteousness that he may use his free will to choose the good. This denial of original sin brought into the spotlight the latent issue involved in the whole Theory-its tendency to deny the place of the supernatural and the spiritual as such in the world. Matters were made no better when, in 1693, the notorious deist Charles Blount published The Oracles of Reason, which included the chap- ters of the Archaeologiae dealing with the Fall. This unwelcome support was the final blow; and as a biographer delicately puts it, it was judged proper, in that critical Season, that Dr. Burnet should retire from his Post of Clerk of the Closet to his Majesty."22 His prospects for promotion to a bishopric vanished. One might hastily conclude that Burnet was a deist; and cer- tainly the frequent charges that his Theory comforted the deists are well founded. Yet, such is the complexity of transitions in the history of thought, he was far from accepting deistic ideas. He firmly believed in the resurrection of the body, which he explained "philosophically;" he was a kind of Trinitarian; he genuinely ac- cepted most of the Scriptures as Revelation; and a curious aura of personal Providence hovers over his mechanical universe. Nat- ural law is never that alone, but the instrument of a Providential 22 Biographical sketch in the 7th ed. of the Theory (London, 1759), xxvi.</page><page sequence="9">62 ERNEST TUVESON purpose, of an upward and purifying movement; and this is true of his fellow tellurists. It is not too much to suggest that they are one means by which a teleological character, a kind of dis- guised Providence, becomes firmly attached in the minds of later generations to "scientific law.9" That weather vane of the decade, Dunton's "Athenian Soci- ety," which had Sir William Temple as patron and Swift as con- tributor and admirer, indicates the change in opinion.23 In May, 1691, the Athenian Mercury defended the Theory against the alle- gations of "a certain Reverend person" who found "little less than Heresy in 't; 9 X2 and in July of the same year, this publication again commends Burnet.25 But the supplement of the fourth vol- ume of the Athenian OraCle, in a long review of the Archaeologiae, gives quite another impression. The second part of Burnet 's treatise (which deals with the Fall) is found to be "rais'd upon the Ruins of eternal Reason and Religion." The theory itself now is discovered to be heretical-" agreeable enough and very pretty for an Hypothesis, only we must lay Scripture by if we be- lieve one Tittle of it.' 26 These two points-that the new world- and flood-making the- ories are unscriptural, and that they are mere homespun "hypoth- eses" which go far beyond the possible limits of human experi- ence and proof, and meddle with matters upon which we can have no reliable opinions except those God has given us-are the prin- cipal points of the campaigners against the theories. Erasmus Warren, for example, points the danger of "abusing" philosophy, "which grows so fast and high in noble Improvements," by attrib- uting everything to secondary causes so as to exclude miracles from the world.2 Philosophical explanations must be measured by the truth that came down from above.28 Burnet has advanced his hypothesis too confidently, outrunning his evidence.29 Thus was confirmed the widely held suspicion that the new philosophy 23 See H.

Steeves, " 'The Athenian Virtuosi' and 'The Athenian Society," MLR (1932), 363ff. 24 The Athenian Gazette: or Casuistical Mercury, I, Number 29, Question 9. 25Athenian Mercury, II, Number 18, Question 12. 26 3d ed.

Burnet, as has been remarked, was inspired by Descartes' cos- mic hypothesis.30 But, some said, Descartes had gone far beyond what human reason can do; he had raised a reckless guess to the level of a dogmatic cosmogony. Perhaps one reason for the ex- treme positivism which Newton finally expressed in the Opttcks is to be found in the world-makers ' movement and the reaction which it provoked.31 This attitude is shown in the ablest attack on Bur- net and Whiston made in the period. James Keill, an eminent mathematician, an associate and defender of Newton, asserts that we must take into account "final" (or theological) causes as well as efficient ones; we can, by observation and mathematical analysis, exactly determine the nature of certain laws currently operating within our experience; but the beginning and end, and the miracu- lous dispensations of God in the universe are not to be measured by our deduction; they are within the scope of authoritative revela- tion. It is notable that the objection to Burnet and Whiston is associated with the growing Newtonian reaction against Descartes, who is accused of being irreligious as well as unscientific. This is to become a familiar note in Temple, Swift, and others who are not Newtonians. Descartes has encouraged this presumptuous pride in the Philosophers, that they think they under- stand all the works of Nature, and are able to give a good account of them.... He was the first world-maker this Century produced, for he supposes that God at the beginning created only a certain quantity of matter, and motion, and from thence he endeavors to shew, how, by the necessary law of Mechanisme, without any extraordinary concurrence of the Divine Power, the world and all that therein is might have been pro- duced.32 All this echoes a parallel attack being carried on in France. Father Gabriel Daniel's Voyage du mo?nde de Descartes (1690), takes as its special point of satire Descartes' vaunted "vastness 30 See Parts III and IV of The Principles of Philosophy. 31 On Newton's attitude towards hypotheses, see Marjorie Nicolson, Newton Demands the Muse (Princeton, 1946), 74; and E.

"4 The satire shows what these delicate principles are. Descartes boasts that he can make a universe in two hours, given the materials, and, assisted by Father Mersenne, he sets to work, soon whipping up vortices, stars, and planets-all of which, how- ever, are invisible except to faithful Cartesians!3 That this at- tack on Descartes as the head of system-makers fell in with an Eng- lish movement is indicated not only by the parallel with Keill, but also by the possibility that Swift's description of the moderns' bowmen, who shot their arrows beyond the atmosphere, never to fall down again but to turn into meteors or stars, was derived from Daniel.36 In the year 1697, Robert St. Clair, who appears to have been one of Boyle's research assistants, makes the same point, and in- troduces an image which is worthy of close attention: . . . to make the whole first chapter of Genesis, wherein the Spirit of God does e composito, give an account of the Creation false, is a piece of Pre- 33A Voyage to the World of Cartesius (London, 1692), Sig. A3r andv. There was a second English edition in 1694. Burnet in general followed Boyle's modifi- cation of Descartes, whereby final causes were considered in natural philosophy; but there was a vagueness in Boyle's statement as to what final causes might include, and how they could be ascertained. The tellurist controversy helped to bring this problem into focus. See The Works of the Honourable Robert Boyle (London, 1772), V, 401, 444. 34 Op. cit., 3-4. 35 Ibid., 207ff. 36 Battle of the Books, in Prose Works of Jonathan Swift, ed; Davis, I, 152. The leaders of the bowmen, Descartes, Gassendi, and Hobbes, can shoot their arrows beyond the atmosphere. Daniel points out that, "According to the new System, the Sun as far out of Gun-shot of the Earth as he is, could not warrant his own Security, in case there should be a People that inrag'd at the heat and scorching of his Rays, should sometime joyn to give him an innumberable flight of Arrows." Op. cit., 288. The reason is that the arrows would be caught by the vortex of the sun, and pulled by the second element into the center of that star. So Father Mer- senne assures Descartes that, on one occasion when he had discharged a musket perpendicularly towards the zenith, the bullet never came down again; "for it must have infallibly been carried to the Sun." The fear of the Laputans that the sun would become encrusted with its effluvia probably is based on the Cartesian theory that stars lost their vortices and were "degraded" to planets because of the formation of a thick layer of "scurf" on their surfaces. Burnet based his cosmogony on this idea.</page><page sequence="12">SWIFT AND THE WORLD-MAKERS 65 sumption few have been guilty of besides our Theorist.... If in this my small endeavour, I may find your Patrociny, I shall not care for the dis- pleasure of these men of Ephesus, whose trade it is to make shrines to this their Diana of Hypothetical Philosophy, I mean who in their Closets make Systems of the World, prescribe Law to Nature, without ever consulting her by Observation and Experience, who (to use the Noble Lord Verulam's words) like the Spider, with great labour, spin a curious Cob-web out of their Brains, that is good for nothing but to be swept down, which tho' it has a great shew of reason, in effect, has no better right to that venerable Title, than the fancies of those who are said to make Windmills in their Head.37 The association of references in this passage contains in epitome much of the intellectual history of the immediately preceding years. In 1695, there was published a collection of works by Blount, in- cluding his Great Is Diana of the Ephesians, a thinly veiled attack on the Christian clergy, and The Oracles of Reason. Now, as has been noted, the Oracles included a translation of two chapters from Burnet's Archaeologiae, as well as an appendix to this work which Blount singled out for special praise. In it, Burnet, prob- ably drawing upon that storehouse of ethnological lore, Bernier's Voyages, had told of a "Brachmin" legend of a cosmic spider-a story which he took to be a corrupted form of the ancient tradition about the great cycle of the creation and consummation of the world: They likewise Philosophize after the mnanner of the Ancients, upon the Creation of the Universe, together with its End and Destruction; for they explain these things by the Efflux or Emanation of all things from God, and by their Mythological Way. For they feign a certain immense Spider to be the first Cause of all Things, and that she, with the Matter she ex- hausted out of her own Bowels, spun the web of this whole Universe, and then disposed of it with a most wonderful Art; whilst she her self in the mean time sitting on top of her Work feels, rules, and governs the Motion of each Part.38 St. Clair, then, assumes that an informed reader will associate the Blount-Gildon deistic group, the world-makers' spinning out uni- verses, and Bacon's symbol of hypothetical philosophy. Even Keill associates the controversy with the debate of an- 37 The Abyssinian Philosophy Confuted: or, Tellutris Theoria Neither Sacred, nor Agreeable to Reason (London, 1697), 89. 38 The Oracles of Reason, in The Miscellaneous Works of Charles Blount, Esq.

That world-making, with consequent assump- tion of superiority of the present-day thinkers over those of an- tiquity, is a modern phenomenon, is pointed out: ... till this Age of World-makers, Christians have always thought them [Creation and the deluge] such works, as could never be produced by the laws of Nature and Mechanism. He remarks that Moses himself was the "most ancient Writer [who] is now extant, and the only one who gives us an account of the state and condition of the Primitive World."39 Aside from divine inspiration, his very antiquity is a guarantee of his accuracy, inasmuch as he lived in a time close to the remaking of the world after the deluge. It would appear, moreover, that Descartes and Aristotle were considered as the traditionally opposed antagonists (as they are in the Battle of the Books) and that when the reputa- tion of one went down, the other, per contra, went up. So Keill, the partisan of the new philosophy, takes Burnet to task for his "rude" treatment of Aristotle, who has "been honoured with the general commendations of all the Learned thro' so many Ages."40 All this, of course, would be grist for the mill of a man who agreed with Sir William Temple's denunciation of the modern: But, God be thanked, his Pride is greater than his Ignorance; and what he wants in Knowledge, he supplies by Sufficiency. . .. His own Reason is the certain Measure of Truth, his own Knowledge, of what is possible in Nature, . . . the Modern Scholars, because they have for a Hundred Years past learned their Lesson pretty well, are much more knowing than the Ancients their Masters.41 There is sufficient evidence as to Swift's preoccupation with the the world-makers. Chapter XV of the Memoirs of Scriblerus, that monument of the Swift-Pope group, if not entirely of Swift himself, indicates that the activities of the world-makers were an object of the Scriblerians' satire. Scriblerus is described as the "Prodigy of our Age," and is similar to those worshippers of hypothetical philosophy described by St. Clair who may well be called, The Philosopher of Ultimate Causes, since, by a Sagacity peculiar to himself, he hath discover'd Effects in their very Cause; 39 Op. cit., 222. This was the traditional and orthodox opinion. One of Burnet's heresies was his assertion that Moses could not be the most ancient writer. 40Ibid., 308. 41 Ed. cit.

In this chapter Descartes appears as the one who "first taught the right use sometimes of the Fuga Vacui, and sometimes the Materia Subtilis, in resolving the grand Phenomena of Nature." It may be Whiston who had a project of "discovering the Longitude, by Bomb-Vessels, and of increasing the Trade-Wind by vast plantations of Reeds and Sedges." "IA Mechanical Expli- cation of the Formation of the Universe, according to the Epicu- rean Hypothesis" is aimed, no doubt, at the world-makers among others, for in them opponents saw the most conspicuous revival of Epicurus' fortuitous concourse of atoms.43 "A Calculation of the proportion in which the Fluids of the Earth decrease, and of the period in which they will be totally exhausted" refers to the tel- lurists' theory that the earth is drying out preparatory to the final conflagration."4 The "Tide-Tables, for a Comet, that is to ap- proximate towards the Earth" clearly applies to Halley's and Whiston's theories. The project of the "Menstruum to dissolve the Stone, made of Dr. Woodward's Universal Deluge-water" is directed at Woodward's belief that the surface of the earth was wholly dissolved in the deluge, and that geological strata are the result of the settling down of dissolved particles. Objectors ques- tioned whether any flood of 150 days ' duration could have produced any such effect. An outgrowth of this part of the Scriblerian project probably was the publication in 1732 of A True and Faithful Narrative of What Passed in London. Swift here satirizes Whiston as a Mil- lenarian; the world-makers were also world-enders. The prophet- 42 The Works of Alexander Pope, Esq., ed. Chalmers (London, 1806), VI, 174. Burnet'Is Theory (1697 ed., annotated in Swift's handwriting), and Woodward's Naturalis Historia Telluris were in Swift's library. 43 Keill, for example, asks how, since Burnet derives the formation of the earth "purely from natural causes, and the necessary Laws of Mechanism," his "opinion differs from that of the Epicurean." Op. cit., 188. 44 Burnet thought a great drought would prepare the world for the fire. William Worthington thinks the "drying up of the earth ... will, by degrees, render it more combustible."

The comet appears on schedule to the minute, and by noon "IThe belief was universal that the day of judgment was at hand."'5 The great influence of the combined respect for mathematical pronouncement and for the Millenarian agitation is shown by the tremendous effect this event has on all groups, even those who had been notorious for deism or worse, and so doubted the Millennium. There are, so far as this paper is concerned, sev- eral points to the satire. There is the presumptuous pride of men who believe that, by the new techniques of mathematical physics, they can see into God's secret plans; "no man knoweth the hour," the Scriptures warn, and yet the assumption that Halley's comet is to be the instrument of divine action would make it possible for men to foretell the time and manner of the great transfiguration. Again, the doctrine of the earthly Millennium, which had been re- vived about the turn of the century, by groups whom Swift dis- liked-the Puritans, and the Cambridge Platonists who were fore- runners of the physico-theologians-was in itself a modern notion; for, although chiliastic views had been held by several of the Fa- thers, the belief in the restoration of the earthly paradise had fal- len into disrepute by the time of Augustine, and, except for the Anabaptists, no more had been heard of it until it experienced a sudden revival in Swift's own century. The combination of the doctrine with scientific ideas and with faith in progress had given it prestige, and it should not be regarded merely as a manifesta- tion of the lunatic fringe; it was one of the important ideas of the period. As a practical ecclesiastical statesman, Swift was aware of the danger which lay in such theories. After the hour predicted by Whiston for the end of the present world had come and gone without untoward event, Swift notes "that Mr. Woolston adver- tis 'd, in that very Saturday's Evening-Post, a new Treatise against the Miracles of our Savior; " and the " total Darkness, that hitherto us'd to terrify, now comforted every Free-thinker and Atheist."'6 An orgy of dissipation sets in. The condition of the world, in short, is even worse than it was before the prophecy, which had caused a false reform. Extravagant religious fantasies, 45Prose Works of Jonathan Swift, ed.

They undermine the salutary faith in real miracles on which sound religion stands. The rationalizing divines and the physico-theologians are brack- eted with the out-and-out deists in Mr. C n's Discourse of Free Thinking, Put into Plain English, for the Use of the Poor. More, Tillotson, and Whiston are heroes of the freethinkers.47 Antagonism to the tellurists in part explains Swift's consistent aversion to system-makers.48 The combination of enthusiasm, devisers of systems, and the suggestion of materialistic atheism in The Tale of a Tub is significant: Of such great Emolument, is a Tincture of this Vapour, which the world calls Madness, that without its Help, the World would not only be de- prived of those two great Blessings, Conquests and Systems, but even all Mankind would unhappily be reduced to the same belief in Things In- visible.49 "Monsieur Des Cartes" as in the anti-tellurist material is the mas- ter of the system-makers, and chief devil. The fable of the spider and the bee turns against the moderns their own figure of the cobweb, usually aimed at the Aristotelians and connected with the defense of progress of knowledge.50 As has been pointed out, the precedent for this reversal comes from 47Prose Works, ed. Temple Scott, ed. cit., III, 310. 48World-makers and system-makers were interchangeable terms. Thus Gold- smith, in a discussion of the cosmogonies treated of here, mentions Buffon who, he says, is "as much a system-maker as Burnet or Whiston." A History of the Earth and Animated Nature (London and Edinburgh, 1853), I, 70. 49 Prose Works, ed. Davis, I, 107. 50 Boyle, for instance, gives a detailed account of the man who refuses to use his faculties to observe the universe, as comparable to a spider in a palace living ignorant of all the other rooms in the building, making it "her whole business by intrapping of flies, to continue an useless life." Works, op. cit., II, 10. He is ex- panding Bacon's picture of abstract reasoners who "resemble spiders, who make cobwebs out of their substance," in contrast to the bee. Novum Organum, xcv (The Philosophical Works, ed. Robertson, London, 1905), 288. In The Advancement of Learning, the metaphor is specifically applied to the Aristotelians. (Ibid., 55.) The bee had been recognized as the symbol not only of the wise gatherer and user of knowledge, but of the divine wisdom itself. Sandys observes, after quoting Virgil's first Georgic to this effect, that "the wisdome of the creature . . . is derived from the divine Minde." Ovid's Metamorphosis (London, 1640), 285. Bacon's contrast of the spider and the bee, which "gathers its material from the flowers of the garden and of the field, but transforms and digests it by a power of its own," is given in the Robertson ed., above cited, 288.</page><page sequence="17">70 ERNEST TUVESON St. Clair. It is by no means unlikely that the passage quoted from this writer's book gave the initial inspiration for the fable. Since the book, which appeared about the time the Battle probably was being written, dealt with a subject of close interest to Temple and Swift, there is a strong possibility that Swift read it. Seen in this light, the debate of the spider and the bee may fit the course of the controversy between the world-makers and their opponents. The bee, which may represent the divine and tradi- tional account of the nature of things, is at first entangled in the spider's web, just as the theories had an initial success, followed by a severe reaction.51 The fact that the spider is especially skilled in the mathematics would have special application to Whiston, whose theory is intensely mathematical, and is organized by " Lem- mata and Corollaries." The spider, when the bee flies into his web "feeling the terrible Convulsion, supposed at first, that Na- ture was approaching to her fi;lal Dissolution"-appropriately enough, in view of the preoccupation of the world-makers with the Millennium. The fact that the spider was " swollen up to the first magnitude by the destruction of infinite numbers of flies" is in keeping with the popularity of the theories, and with the danger- ous encouragement to irreligion they were supposed to give-so that there were traps for souls. Even the "Chasms, and Ruins, and Dilapidations" of the spider's fortress recall details of the controversy; for these were favorite terms in Burnet's theory, which gives vivid descriptions of the great chasms in the earth caused by the breaking of its surface, and of the present globe as a ''ruin'" without regularity or plan. This concept aroused strong opposition in itself, since it was considered to deny the wisdom and foresight of God in the conduct of Providence; and the air of the 1690's resounded with the words " ruin, ""precipice," "chasm, " and " deformity.

The charge of the bee that " In that Building of 51 The scientific cosmogonies reached perhaps their lowest ebb in popular esteem about the end of the decade, although interest in them continued strong. Later in the century, they again rose in reputation and formed a foundation of historical geology. Their status at the turn of the century is indicated by Hearne's Ductor Historicus, which strongly condemns Whiston and Burnet, who "Combat the Doctrine of that Holy Writer [Moses] that it [the deluge] was a Miraculous Event produc'd by the immediate Hand of God; and Assert it was a Natural effect of Second Causes." 4th ed. (London, 1723), I, 184. 52 For a number of quotations illustrating this controversy, see H. V. S.

Another Scriblerian, Dr. Arbuthnot, attacked Woodward in part because of his disregard for Moses: I wish the Compilers of Theories would have more regard to Moses's Rela- tion, which surpasses all the Accounts of Philosophers as much in Wis- dom, as it doth in Authority. The Doctor is not singular in this, it is but too common a Fault now a-days.53 The Letter to the Students of both Universities, relating to the new Discoveries in Religion and the Sciencves, and the Principal Inven- tors of them, although of doubtful pedigree, indicates that satire of the world-makers was popularly associated with the Swift- Arbuthnot group. The following notions are attributed to the free operation of the "fancy," unassisted by the reason: 139ff. The popular interest in the issue is shown by the fact that Ray's Miscel- laneous Discourses concerning the Dissolution and Changes of the World, inspired in large part by the problem, had a second edition within a year of initial publication. 53 An Examination of Dr. Woodward's Account of the Deluge, Kc., in The Miscellaneous Works of the Late Dr. Arbuthnot (Glasgow, 1751), II, 215-16. See also Lester M. Beattie, John Arbuthnot, Mathematician and Satirist (Cambridge, 1935), Chapter III. Gay's Three Hours After Marriage, on which Pope and Arbuth- not collaborated, satirizes the Deluge controversy. The title of the tragedy which the blue-stocking, Mrs. Clinket, has composed is "The Universal Deluge, or the Tragedy of Deucalion and Pyrrha." The controversies over the Flood were much taken up with the question whether this supposedly historical event of ancient Greece was the same flood as Noah's. There is a reference to Woodward's theories, and his quarrel with Arbuthnot, in the question "Besides, if Stones were dissolved, as a late Philosopher hath proved, how eould Steeples stand'?" Perhaps the subtlest hit of all, however, is Mrs. Clinket's remark that "The Vray-semblance and the Miracu- lous are linkt together with such Propriety !" Linking the two was indeed just what the Cartesian and Newtonian world- and flood-makers attempted to do. Not the deluge itself, but the attempt to explain this supernatural work of God in terms of rationalism and science forms the substance of the satire. I am indebted, also, to Professor George Sherburn, who has pointed out that, in a letter to Swift dated 15 October 1725, Pope uses imagery which shows that he was familiar in detail with the scientific Millenial works, ineluding such questions as the relation of the numerical resurrection to the Cartesian atomism.

Ball, III, 281.</page><page sequence="19">72 ERNEST TUVESON to hunt, for Instance, after Comets, and catch them by the tail; to reform the Architecture of the World; and make the Creation look a little more Mathematical; to discover the Globe of Earth to be only a large Work in a kind of Pastry, and that the Crust parting by Excess of Heat, and drop- ping Piecemeal into the Liquor enclos'd occasioned the Deluge; and that the Stars, which the Vulgar look upon, as so many Lights hung out in a dark passage, are really so many fine populous Countries, containing some Millions of Acres in Terra Firma.54 Similarly, it is ironically found that "not one of the sacred Writers understood Algebra;" and the author is supposed to be debating whether "to erect a new Hypothesis for the Solution of all the Phenomena, or write a Piece to question the Being of any." It may, then, be concluded that world-making was, in the 1690's, the central issue in the struggle of science and religion and that it was closely related to the issue of progress and of the ancients vs. moderns. This point supports the conclusion of Professor R. F. Jones, that the controversy which led to The Battle of the Books had a scientific nature.55 It gives background and motive for the scientific satire in Gulliver, which has been comprehensively studied by Professors Marjorie Nicolson and Nora M. Mohler.56 Further, it emphasizes the basic continuity and consistenicy of Swift's opinions. To illustrate more fully the last-mentioned point, it may be well to look at Swift's positive statements of belief as well as the satiri- cal works. His first published piece, The Ode to the Athenian Society, shows that he was concerned with the general problem of science and faith, and that he took an orthodox stand: The 'Wits, I mean the Atheists of the Age, Who fain would rule the Pulpit, as they do the Stage, Wondrous Refiners of Philosophy, Of Morals and Divinity, By the new Modish System of reducing all to sense,57 54 In A Supplement to Dean Sw - - t's Miscellanies, published in The Miscel- laneous Works, cited above, II, 108. 5 Ancients and Moderns (Washington University Studies, 1936), 278.

Wherein, if they cou'd prevail, the natural and easie Result wou'd be not to believe one Word in all those Sacred Oracles.59 Here, in epitome, is much of Swift's objection to the new move- ment in religion and philosophy. It is the presumption of the new hypotheses, with their dogma of progress amounting to a superan- nuation of part of Revelation itself, that Temple objects to, and we may safely assume that Swift concurred: One great difference must be confessed between the ancient and modern learning; theirs led them to a sense and acknowledgement of their own ignorance, the imbecility of human understanding, the incomprehension even of things about us, as well as those above us; . . . ours leads us to presumption, and vain ostentation of the little we have learned, and makes us think we do, or shall know, not only all natural, but even what we call supernatural things; all in the heavens, as well as upon earth; more than all mortal men have known before our age; and shall know in time as much as angels.60 The violence and intensity of Swift's opinions on this subject is shown by his statement, dated 13 January 1698/9, about the book which set forth the credo and apology of the Royal Society virtuosi: "If 'Scepsis Scientifica' comes to me, I will burn it for a fustian piece of abominable curious virtuoso stuff.

These matters have importance; but of larger significance is the stirring of a new spirit in all things-we may call it "modernism." Its elements appeared recognizably in the con- troversy of religion and science during the 1690's: the faith in teleological progress and in a kind of "progressive" religion; the testing of revelation and authority in general by reason and scien- tific concepts rather than vice versa; the supremacy of material- istic physical law, even to the exclusion of miracles; the tendency to replace the Christian humanist conception of man's nature with one which tended inevitably to deny original sin, spiritual salva- tion, and the place of "mystery" in religion.63 That is to say, it was the materialist, progressivist era that Swift regarded as both imminent and degenerate. With the new world spirit he would not come to terms, however natural and easy it made things appear to be.
