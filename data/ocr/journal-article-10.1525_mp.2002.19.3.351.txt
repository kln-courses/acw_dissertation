Musical Forces, Melodic Expectation, and Jazz Melody S T EV E  LAR SON University of Oregon I review the theoretical and experimental literature on musical forces and melodic expectation, showing important connections between that work and the work of leading jazz theorists. I then show how ideas de- rived from that work may help us understand a few passages of recorded jazz. The examples include two compositions (the “heads” to Charlie Parker’s “Confirmation” and Toshiko Akiyoshi’s “I Ain’t Gonna Ask No More”) and a few improvised passages (by Bill Evans and Charlie Parker). Viewing these examples in terms of what cognitive science tells us about melodic expectation clarifies their rhetorical and gestural “mean- ings.” Furthermore, these same examples can help us test those same theories of melodic expectation—multiple regression analysis of the fre- quency with which certain patterns are completed within these same ex- amples provides an empirical test of assertions derived from the litera- ture reviewed. THIS special issue of Music Perception on jazz and cognition offers aunique opportunity to review and extend the theoretical and empirical literature on musical forces and melodic expectation. Writings on forces and expectations have important, but still unacknowledged, connections with the literature of jazz theory. And these connections raise central, but still unanswered, questions about how the ideas of musical forces and me- lodic expectation may illuminate jazz practice itself—and about how jazz practice may itself provide a test of those same ideas. This article begins with a review of the theoretical and empirical litera- ture on musical forces and melodic expectation. But it gives a fresh view of that topic by showing how those ideas relate to important work in jazz theory (including work by Richmond Browne, Henry Martin, George Russell, Steven Strunk, and Keith Waters). It illustrates those same ideas by showing how they may help us better understand a few passages of re- corded jazz (by Charlie Parker, Toshiko Akiyoshi, and Bill Evans).

A Brief Summary of the Theory—Musical Forces As Metaphor The theory argues that we experience musical motions metaphorically in terms of our experience of physical motions, and it identifies three “mu- sical forces”: “gravity” (the tendency of a note heard as “up in the air” to descend), “magnetism” (the tendency of an unstable note to move to the nearest stable pitch, a tendency that grows stronger the closer we get to a goal), and “inertia” (the tendency of a pattern of musical motion to con- tinue in the same fashion, where what is meant by “same” depends upon what that musical pattern is “heard as”). That is, even though music does not literally move, experienced listeners of tonal music hear that music metaphorically as purposeful physical action—subject to musical forces that are analogous to the physical forces that shape physical motion. A complete description of the theory is beyond the scope of this article. But an important claim of the theory is that this metaphorical “hearing as” is one source of expressive meaning in music and that it contributes to musical expectations. In short, the theory claims that experienced listeners of tonal music (including jazz) expect completions in which these musical forces control operations on alphabets (as described by Deutsch &amp; Feroe, 1981) to produce hierarchies of embellishment (of the type described by Schenker 1935/1979), whose stepwise displacements of auralized traces create simple closed shapes. By describing music in terms of “operations on alphabets,” Deutsch and Feroe (1981) argue that listeners internally represent passages of music in terms of alphabets (e.g., the chromatic scale, the major scale, and specific chords) and operations (e.g., repetition, or motion to the next higher or lower member) that create motions through those alphabets. By describing music in terms of “hierarchies of embellishment,” Schenker (1935/1979) makes a similar claim. Schenker’s theories—which have al- ready been recast as theories of music cognition by Westergaard (1975) and by Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983)—may be taken to argue that listen- ers internally represent passages of music as embellishments of simpler pat- terns, which are themselves embellishments of yet simpler patterns. By describing passages of music in terms of “stepwise displacements of auralized traces,” I mean that in melodic “steps” (i.e., in half steps and whole steps), the second note is heard as displacing the internal representa- tion of the first as melodically active; whereas in melodic “leaps” (i.e., in intervals larger than a whole step), both notes leave “traces” (i.e., are heard as melodically active). The result is that these “operations on alphabets” </page> <page sequence="3"> Musical Forces, Melodic Expectation, and Jazz Melody 353 and “hierarchies of embellishments” may be described in terms of “strands of voice leading” like those described in Schenker’s theory of “compound melody.” For the purposes of this article, I will not define “simple closed shapes.” I believe that a complete understanding of melodic expectation requires that this term be defined and its ramifications explored.1 However, the points I will make in this article can rely on the shared intuitions of this journal’s readers about the meaning of “simple closed shapes.” The remainder of this article clarifies and illustrates the meanings of all of these terms and relates these ideas to important work in jazz scholar- ship. The view that emerges is that our experience of tonal music—includ- ing jazz—is shaped by conceptual processes in which listeners hear music in terms of metaphorical musical forces. Furthermore, because the interaction of these constantly acting but con- textually determined musical forces obeys the logic of forces in the physical world, this allows (and encourages) us to attribute implications, intentions, and meanings to musical events before and after they happen (these attri- butions include the “retrospection of anticipation” and “anticipation of retrospection,” also discussed later). This view of metaphor as constitutive of experience resonates with some current work in philosophy and cognitive linguistics (Johnson, 1987; Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980, 1999). Further, it is supported by recent studies of meta- phor and embodiment in music analysis (Aksnes, 1996, 1997; Cox, 1999; Guck, 1981, 1991; Kassler, 1991). But it also reflects current work in jazz scholarship. The central meta- phors of jazz-as-language and jazz-as-motion figure in much nonanalytical writing and talk about jazz. It is common to hear jazz musicians speak of “telling a story” and this idea has been pursued in “serious” jazz scholar- ship by several authors (see, e.g., Gushee, 1981; Larson, 1996a; Monson, 1996). When jazz musicians speak of “swing,” I believe they are invoking 1. Although the concept of “simple closed shape” is an important one in gestalt psychol- ogy, that literature never offered a clear definition. One example of the importance of simple closed shapes concerns the commonly made observation that large leaps tend to be fol- lowed by steps in the opposite direction. Narmour’s model (1990) asserts that listeners expect all large leaps to be followed by steps in the opposite direction and elevates this principle to the level of a hard-wired perceptual tendency. The theory offered here helps to explain why this is often—but not always—the case. Listeners have a drive toward simplic- ity that favors attributing the simplest possible interpretation to any percept. Because me- lodic leaps tend to leave traces, compound melodic structures introduce complexity by in- creasing the number of traces. When the individual “lines” of a compound melodic structure converge, the number of traces is reduced. The “global rule” for species counterpoint of- fered by David Lewin (1983) is an elegant expression of this idea. Paul von Hippel and David Huron (von Hippel, 2000; von Hippel &amp; Huron, 2000) argue that listeners expect large leaps to be followed by motion in the opposite direction simply because large leaps take us toward the extreme of a voice’s or instrument’s range, and that there are often fewer available pitches in the same direction after a large leap. </page> <page sequence="4"> 354 Steve Larson the metaphor of music as physical motion. In fact, I have discussed the role of musical forces in the creation of swing in Oscar Peterson’s piano playing (Larson, 1999b). Coker (1964) notes that “tonic chords are like magnets” (p. 71). And Janna Saslaw (2000) has explicity applied the work of Lakoff and Johnson in her jazz scholarship. Operations on Alphabets and Chord-Scale Theory A central claim of the theory of musical forces is that those forces con- trol what are called “operations” on “alphabets.” As noted earlier, some recent work in music cognition (Deutsch &amp; Feroe, 1981; Simon &amp; Sumner, 1968) argues that listeners internally represent passages of music in terms of alphabets (e.g., the chromatic scale, the major scale, and specific chords) and operations (e.g., repetition, or motion to the next higher or lower mem- ber) that create motions through those alphabets. This work also claims that such representations have a cognitive “economy of means”—that is, that such representations allow our musical memories to store melodies more easily this way than in other ways. And my computer models of me- lodic expectation (Larson, 1993a, 1993b, 1994, 1996b, 1999a, in press-a) suggest that such representations play a central role in the production of melodic completions. It is easy to see how typical jazz “licks” may be thought of as operations on alphabets. Figure 1 shows a lick from Charlie Parker’s (1946) perfor- mance of “Oh, Lady Be Good!” (For transcriptions and analyses of the entire performance, see Larson, 1996a; Russell, 1959; and Woideck, 1996). This passage may be described as the result of two operations (the addition of a prefix created by ascending through the chromatic alphabet, and the addition of a suffix created by repeating tones) on a descending arpeggiation of a G-major chord (itself the result of another operation: descending through the alphabet of the tonic triad). But it is also possible to describe any pas- sage of music in terms of such operations on alphabets. As Deutsch and Feroe note, these alphabets can relate to one another in hierarchic fashion. Fred Lerdahl (1988, 2001) uses the hierarchical nesting of such alphabets to describe the relative stability of tones in his “tonal Fig. 1.  A lick from Charlie Parker’s 1946 performance of “Oh, Lady Be Good!” This passage may be described as the result of two operations (the addition of a prefix created by ascending through the chromatic alphabet and the addition of a suffix created by repeating tones) on a descending arpeggiation of a G-major chord (itself the result of another opera- tion:  descending through the alphabet of the tonic triad). </page> <page sequence="5"> Musical Forces, Melodic Expectation, and Jazz Melody 355 pitch space.” My computer models of melodic expectation (Larson, 1993a, 1993b, 1994, 1996b, 1999a, in press-a) use pairs of alphabets to suggest how musical motions (driven by musical forces) move within one alphabet (a “reference alphabet”) toward notes of greater stability (members of a subset alphabet called a “goal alphabet”). But jazz theory precedes all these authors. George Russell’s 1959 Lydian chromatic concept inaugurated an important stream of jazz theory called “chord-scale theory” (Amuedo, 1996; Gonda, 1971–72; Jungbluth, 1983; Pressing, 1978). Chord-scale theory associates with each chord one or more chord scales that best project the sound of that chord. And, as Russell described the hierarchical nesting of these alphabets in 1959, the chro- matic scale provides motion through the more-stable “parent” chord-scale, which in turn provides motion through the more-stable chord. Figure 2 illustrates the idea of chord scales with a passage from Bill Evans’s three-piano performance of “Stella by Starlight” (for a transcription and analysis of other passages from this performance, see Larson, 1997–98b). In the passage given, the harmonies may be described as G7 (measures 17 and 18), Cmin7 (measures 19 and 20), and A 7 (measures 21 and 22). (The tonic chord, B maj7, follows in measure 23.) The piano labeled “Right” (in the right channel of the album’s stereo mix) plays the melody. The piano labeled “Left” arpeggiates the chords just described. These arpeggiations introduce “tensions” or “extensions” typical for these chords in this con- text (G7 has altered ninths and an altered thirteenth; Cmin7 has a ninth and eleventh [as well as a passing thirteenth]; and A 7 has a ninth, a raised eleventh, and a thirteenth). The result is chords of six and seven notes. If those same notes are placed in a single octave, the result is a scale. While different jazz musicians might give these chord scales different names, we can call them respectively “G altered dominant” (if we assume D , as played in the Center part) or “G minor-dominant” (if we assume D, as played in the melody), “C dorian,” and “A  lydian-dominant.” We may think of Evans’s chord voicings as subsets of these scales. We may think of Evans’s melodies as being built from such scales. Or we may regard such chord scales as a theoretical abstraction useful in understanding both Evans’s chords and his scales. In any case, the piano labeled “Center” exploits this collapsed distinction between chord and scale by playing chords that are essentially scale fragments. Larson’s “Step Collections,” Pressing’s “Nonadjacent Half-Step Hypothesis,” and Tymoczko’s “Semitone Constraint” The distinction between steps and leaps also plays an important role in the theory of musical forces. The theory claims that melodic leaps tend to leave “traces” and that melodic steps tend to displace those traces. The </page> <page sequence="6"> 356 Steve Larson Fig. 2. A passage from Bill Evans’ three-piano performance of “Stella by Starlight.” The pitch content of each piano track may be regarded as based on appropriately-derived chord- scales. idea is related to what Bharucha (1984) calls “melodic anchoring,” and it reflects work in auditory scene analysis (Bregman, 1990) on “streaming,” which finds that melodic streams form more easily where pitches lie a step apart. Figure 3 illustrates how “compound melody” relies on the stepwise dis- placement of such traces. The passage shown in Figure 3d is from Bill Evan’s Town Hall performance of “Who Can I Turn To?” (for a transcription of the entire performance, see Evans, n.d.). All the notes in Figure 3d appear in Figure 3c, but there they are depicted in a restricted form of Schenkerian analytic notation called “strict use of analytic notation” (Larson, 1996c). Strict use limits the analysis to stems, noteheads, and slurs. Rules governing the use of stems and slurs make the </page> <page sequence="7"> Musical Forces, Melodic Expectation, and Jazz Melody 357 Fig. 3. A passage from Bill Evan’s Town Hall performance of “Who Can I Turn To?” This passages illustrates how “compound melody” relies on the stepwise displacement of me- lodic “traces.” meaning of every embellishment clear. Furthermore, all notes and only those notes that are stemmed on a given level must appear (as a stemmed or unstemmed note) on the next more-remote level. The meaning of any ex- ceptions should be self-evident. This clarifies the assertions of the analysis and requires that every note be accounted for. The result is that each note of embellishment appears as an unstemmed notehead in a slurred figure at one and only one level of structure. This will have additional advantages, as we will see shortly. In Figure 3c, stem direction shows how Evans’s improvised line may be understood as alternating between at least two parts (unstemmed notes are notes of embellishment—here only the suffix repetitions are unstemmed). The upper part, shown with stems up, moves down by step in a single motion that extends over the whole passage. Every time a note of that part is leaped away from, it leaves a trace in our musical memories. That trace is displaced only when it is followed by another note a step away. The same thing happens with the lower parts. However, the lower parts, shown with stems down, are somewhat more complicated. The lower parts make a number of repeated upward motions. Each of these motions eventually converges with the upper part. Every time two parts converge on a single pitch, the total number of parts leaving traces (at the hierarchic level on which the parts converge) is reduced. The result is a reduction in complex- </page> <page sequence="8"> 358 Steve Larson ity. In each case, this reduction in complexity accompanies a resolution of dissonance. (Although this subtle coordination between the reduction of traces and the resolution of dissonance is remarkably beautiful, it seems to be a relatively common feature of Evans’ improvised lines.) Each conver- gence of parts is shown with a set of converging lines in Figure 3c. Figure 3b offers a more detailed explanation of the lower parts. The notes that connect D  (in the first measure of this example) to A  are heard 5 5 as passing tones. That is, the more stable (and thus stemmed) D  and A 5 5 belong to a deeper level of structure than the embellishing (and thus unstemmed) passing tones that connect them. That deeper level of structure is shown in Figure 3a, which includes only the stemmed notes of Figure 3b. As Figure 3a suggests, D  belongs to a 5 “structural alto.” (A second alto—G in the fourth and fifth measures of Figure 3b moving to F  in the sixth measure—is suggested by the dashed slur in Figure 3b, but is not shown in Figure 3a. The E  with the flagged 4 stem in Figure 3b is shown as a structural tenor in Figure 3a.) The use of durational notation in Figure 3a also suggests that both the structural alto and the structural soprano leave traces that keep them present in musical memory throughout the passage. After the lower part converges with the upper part on A , it leaps back down to C , the next note of that structural 5 5 alto. As this leaping between parts continues, the idea of converging lines becomes central to their rhetorical and gestural meaning. Here, the ability of experienced listeners to make sense of the music—to hear it not as a disjointed succession of pointless leaps but as a coherent compound me- lodic structure—relies on their hearing the traces left by melodic leaps. We have seen that jazz theory and the theory of musical forces both suggest that we understand passages of music in terms of “alphabets.” And Schenkerian theory and the theory of musical forces both suggest that we understand melodies in terms of steps and leaps. Putting these two obser- vations together, the theory of musical forces claims a special role for what it calls “step collections” (Hurwitz &amp; Larson, 1994; Larson, 1992). A “step collection” is a group of notes that can be arranged in ascending pitch order to satisfy the following two conditions (where “step” means a half step or a whole step): (1) every adjacent pair of notes is a step apart; and (2) no nonadjacent pair of notes is a step apart (i.e., the collection contains no consecutive semitones). The second condition can be modified slightly to produce a third condition, true of all “proper” step collections: (3) no two pitches—or any of their octave equivalents—that are not adja- cent in the collection (except the first and last) are a step apart. The first condition ensures that the collection can be heard as a complete filling in of a musical space (this follows from recognizing that melodic leaps tend to leave the “trace” of a note “hanging” in our musical memories). The sec- ond condition ensures that no note will be heard as redundant in the filling </page> <page sequence="9"> Musical Forces, Melodic Expectation, and Jazz Melody 359 of that space (this also reflects our desire to avoid confusion and the fact that either a whole step or half step can be heard as a step). The third condition grants a role to octave equivalence, ensuring that adding octave equivalents to a proper step collection will result in a proper step collec- tion. All step collections thus satisfy the “nonadjacent half-step hypothesis” tested by Jeff Pressing (1978) and the “semitone constraint” described by Dmitri Tymoczko (1997). Pressing finds that many chord scales important in jazz practice satisfy his hypothesis. Tymoczko’s work offers his constraint as an important connection between jazz and impressionism. Recent work by Keith Waters (2000) builds on these ideas to illuminate the musical lan- guage of Herbie Hancock.2 Repetition, Browne’s “Retrospection of Anticipation,” and Schenker’s “Hidden Repetition” Another important claim in the theory of musical forces is that, after hearing a bit of music, experienced listeners tend to say to themselves (al- beit usually not consciously) something like “I knew it would go that way!” The first clear exposition of this idea may have come from jazz theorist Richmond Browne (1982). In a presentation on saxophonist Gerry Mulligan, he described this as the “retrospection of anticipation” (he also speaks of the “anticipation of retrospection,” more on this later). Consider the short melodic successions in Figure 4. Assume that we are hearing each in the key of C minor. After hearing Figure 4b, a listener could Fig. 4. Four short melodic successions. The melodic beginning given in Figure 4a, heard in C minor, generates at least three different expectations:  giving in to gravity, it could con- tinue as in Figure 4b; giving in to magnetism, it could continue as in Figure 4c; and giving in to inertia, it could continue as in Figure 4d. 2. Jay Rahn’s (1991) discussion of “ambiguities,” “differences,” and “contradictions” in seven-tone collections is also relevant here. </page> <page sequence="10"> 360 Steve Larson say “I knew it would go that way—gravity pulled the D down to C.” After hearing Figure 4c, a listener could say “I knew it would go that way— magnetism pulled the D up to E .” (Or the same listener might hear the pattern as giving in to inertia by continuing the ascending stepwise mo- tion.) And after hearing Figure 4d, a listener could say “I knew it would go that way—inertia continued the pattern of downward leaps and upward steps.” In other words, Figures 4b, c, and d—even though they all begin the same way (with the notes given in Figure 4a)—all end differently. Yet, the musical forces allow listeners to say to themselves, for any one of those endings, that they “knew it had to go that way.” In this sense, experienced and involved listeners are like jazz improvisers; both are making up the music (or the musical meaning) as they go along—and they try to do it in a way that makes the most sense out of the preceding music. Of course, in music as in language, expectation and retrospection may continuously reshape the meanings we give to what we hear. Schenker (1910/ 1987, pages 188–189) offers a nice example of this in his discussion of Figure 5 (his Example 260). Here is what he says about this passage from Schubert’s “Der Kreuzzug.” The first eighth note of the uppermost voice is an appoggiatura to f 1. The second eighth note is the harmonic tone, the fundamental of the chord itself, which appears here in inversion as a 65-chord. The third eighth note brings once again the same tone f 1; our perception subsequently interprets the tones in retrospect in an entirely different way (Figure 6) and understands the second eighth Fig. 5.

Reprinted by permission of the Gale Group. </page> <page sequence="11"> Musical Forces, Melodic Expectation, and Jazz Melody 361 note only a portamento anticipation of the third eighth note, as shown at b. The fourth eighth note is another second step; thus, the question arises whether this step is only a passing motion or something else. The fifth eighth note provides an answer; since it is itself an ap- poggiatura, the preceding eighth note appears to us in reality again only as an anticipation—that is, a portamento. The sixth and seventh eighth notes show again the same situa- tion as the second and third. Observe at the eighth eighth note the tie, the sign of the keyboard portamento (cf. §17 of Chapter 2 of Schenker, 1910/1987). Figure 7 shows the assemblage of effects so delicately intermixed by the succession of eighth notes. In Schenker’s view, the meanings that we give to music change as we listen, depend on our expectations, and may be revised in retrospect. David Lewin, in an earlier issue of this journal (1986), offers a model of music perception that grants an important role to such real-time processing of musical meaning. It is important to keep in mind this difference between analysis and perception. Schenker’s later writings dwell on analysis—so they insist on showing one and only one interpretation of a passage. But, as the preceding examples suggest, Schenker had a different view of percep- tion—he recognized its multivalent and context-changing character. As I have pointed out elsewhere (Larson, 1987a, 1997), the best way to show that one event may be conceived in contradictory ways is to use different analyses—so that the univalent clarity of contradictory Schenkerian analy- ses shows how a given passage can be perceived in different ways. Furthermore, we like to feel that we “knew it had to go that way”—even when we may know it didn’t. Like the fox (who decided that he didn’t really want the grapes that he couldn’t reach—because they must be sour), we make up stories about our (listening) experience that allow us to feel good about ourselves. We experience the retrospection of anticipation. Of course, we make sense of the physical world in the same way. That we anthropomorphize the physical world, attributing intentions to inani- mate objects, is a commonplace observation; roads “climb” up mountains, Fig. 7.  Example 262 from Schenker (1910/1987). Reprinted by permission of the Gale Group. </page> <page sequence="12"> 362 Steve Larson rocks “want” to fall, and water “seeks” its level. Rudolf Arnheim (1966, 1974) shows nicely how this anthropomorphizing relies on our tendency to attribute dynamic tendencies to the objects of our perceptions, and ar- gues (1986) that musical forces allow us to do the same thing with music. Schenker, who devotes a series of essays (1921–1924) to what he calls Tonwille (“the will of the tones”), makes such anthropomorphic attribu- tions frequently. When we make these attributions after the fact, we are experiencing the retrospection of anticipation. I believe that this is one reason that we derive so much pleasure from repetition in music. (For an illuminating view of the place of repetition in music, see Zuckerkandl, 1956, pp. 212ff.) Repetition rewards listeners who want to feel that they “knew it had to go that way.” The same is true for varied repetitions. As I have pointed out elsewhere—also in a publication on jazz (Larson, 1987b)—a special type of repetition that exploits our pleasure in the retro- spection of anticipation is the type of “hidden repetition” that I call a “con- firmation.” “Hidden repetition” is Heinrich Schenker’s term for what oc- curs when a musical idea occurs on two different levels of musical structure (Burkhart, 1978) or its function changes so much within a phrase that it is not clearly heard as a repetition. A “confirmation” is my term for a hidden repetition in which two versions of a single melodic idea, on two different levels of musical structure, are completed at the same time (I also call the shorter, more-foreground idea itself “the confirmation”). Figure 8 shows a confirmation in another passage improvised by Bill Evans. This figure reproduces part of an analysis (from Larson, in press-b) of Evans’s improvisation on Cole Porter’s song “All of You.” The brackets show that the pattern A –G–F–E appears on three different levels of musi- cal structure. In each case, the pattern is preceded by a B (albeit in different octaves), so we might speak of the pattern as B–A –G–F–E. Because the final E completes all three patterns at the same time, we have a confirma- tion. The last four or five notes of this passage thus summarize, or retrace the steps of, the preceding music. In a confirmation, the simultaneous completion of different versions encourages the listener to attribute a kind of inevitability to that comple- tion. And the fact that two (in this case, three!) versions are the same en- courages the listener to retrospectively attribute to the longer version(s) the same predictability experienced in the shorter version. Schenker, Jazz Theory, and Musical Forces The passage cited above (Figures 5–7) from Schenker’s Counterpoint suggests his interest in musical implications and realizations. But the theory of musical forces goes further and claims that listeners expect </page> <page sequence="13"> Musical Forces, Melodic Expectation, and Jazz Melody 363 Fig. 8. An analysis (from Larson in press-b) of Evans’s improvisation on Cole Porter’s song “All of You.” Because all three bracketed motions are completed simultaneously (a special type of “hidden repetition” called a “confirmation”), the last few notes of this passage thus summarize, or retrace the basic steps of, the preceding music. music to complete the kinds of hierarchical structures that Schenker described. To some readers, my reliance on Schenkerian theory may seem at odds with my emphasis on expectation. Perhaps this is because some theorists who have written about expectation in music (especially Leonard Meyer and Eugene Narmour) have distanced themselves from Schenker’s theories. In fact, Narmour (1977, 1990, 1992) initially described his implication- realization model as an alternative to Schenker’s theories. My purpose in this section is to suggest the strong connections between Schenker’s theo- ries and work in music cognition, melodic expectation, musical forces, and jazz analysis. Narmour’s work on melodic complexity (1992) argues that expectations create hierarchical structures that resemble Schenkerian analyses. But a more recent article, also in this journal (Narmour, 1996), may be read as a more plausible case for the reverse argument: that expectations arise on all per- ceived hierarchical levels of musical structure, that those levels are best described with Schenkerian analyses, and that Schenker’s theories provide a necessary underpinning for any successful implication-realization model. That article, devoted to understanding a movement by Mozart in terms of his implication-realization model, begins by presenting a Schenkerian analy- sis of that movement. </page> <page sequence="14"> 364 Steve Larson Although Schenker’s claims about relationships between distant pitches have proven controversial, some more recent authors have recast his claims as claims about the perceptions of skilled listeners (Larson, 1997; Lerdahl &amp; Jackendoff, 1983; Westergaard, 1975). Others report experiments that support these claims about perception (Dibben, 1994; Marvin &amp; Brinkman, 1999). The practice of improvisation in general, the specific content of many different recorded jazz performances, and the testimony of jazz musicians all suggest that Schenker’s ideas provide a natural—if not essential—way of understanding not only the technical features of recorded jazz perfor- mances, but also of illuminating their artistic content (Larson, 1987b, 1998; Martin, 1988, 1996; Strunk, 1979, 1985, 1996; see the first few footnotes in Larson, 1998, for further citations). The analyses that follow (of a blues head by Toshiko Akiyoshi and a AABA bop head by Charlie Parker) illustrate the operation of the musical forces; offer examples of hidden repetitions that include the “confirma- tion” type; exemplify the retrospection of anticipation and the anticipation of retrospection; show the importance of Schenkerian analysis in under- standing jazz melody, musical forces, and the perception of musical pat- terns; and illuminate the rhetorical and gestural shapes of these pieces. I have cited a number of studies that provide various types of converging empirical evidence for the theory of musical forces. In such studies, music analysis provides evidence for cognitive science. The musical analyses that follow suggest that cognitive science may return the favor; the practice of music analysis can be aided by the theory of musical forces. These analyses illustrate how musical forces allow us to “tell a story” about how we might experience the music. Finally, statistical analysis suggests that the distribu- tion of melodic patterns within these same pieces provides additional em- pirical support for some of the ideas behind the theory of musical forces. Toshiko Akiyoshi’s “I Ain’t Gonna Ask No More” Toshiko Akiyoshi’s “I Ain’t Gonna Ask No More” is a slow 12-bar blues in B . (For a complete score and another analysis of this piece, see Lindsay, 1995.) The first 12-bar chorus is a melody played on bass trombone. The trombone part is not improvised; Akiyoshi has written it out note-for-note. This first chorus is accompanied only by light fills on the drums. Then the trombone restates essentially this same melody over a thicker accompani- ment that includes brass and rhythm section parts. Figure 9 gives that melody and the chords given in Akiyoshi’s score. The figure also includes my tran- scription of the bass line played on the recording. </page> <page sequence="15"> Musical Forces, Melodic Expectation, and Jazz Melody 365 Fig. 9. The opening measures of Toshiko Akiyoshi’s “I Ain’t Gonna Ask No More.” Figures 10 and 11 give a Schenkerian analysis of the same passage.3 The comments that follow are informed by these figures. They also provide the data for the statistical portion of the article that follows. Upon hearing the opening gesture and the chord that comes on the down- beat of the second measure, experienced listeners will suspect that they are hearing a blues. This means that they will expect a certain kind of 12-bar harmonic progression and a certain kind of melodic construction. The harmonic progression in Figure 9 is a 12-bar bebop blues. In fact, it does not differ in any significant way from what an experienced listener would expect. This harmonic predictability provides a good frame for the violations of melodic expectations that it accompanies. Although harmonic predictability provides an excellent balance for me- lodic unpredictability here, jazz harmony can also depart from our predic- 3. In these examples, the bass trombone part has been transposed up two octaves for ease in reading. </page> <page sequence="16"> 366 Steve Larson Fig. 10.

For example, Charlie Parker’s solo on “Oh, Lady Be Good!,” a por- tion of which is quoted in Figure 1, also begins with a similarly “bluesy” lick and has the same harmonic progression from tonic in measure 1 to a dominant-type chord on IV in measure 2, yet it is not a 12-bar blues. But, </page> <page sequence="17"> Musical Forces, Melodic Expectation, and Jazz Melody 367 Fig. 11. A Schenkerian analysis of Toshiko Akiyoshi’s “I Ain’t Gonna Ask No More,” over- view. in “I Ain’t Gonna Ask No More,” we do have a standard bebop blues with its typical harmonic progression. Figure 12 shows a couple of the simpler possible melodic continuations that might be imagined by experienced listeners. Both of these examples are based on the idea of musical inertia—the idea that a pattern of musical motion, once perceived as a pattern, will continue in the same way. Hofstadter and his colleagues (1995) have described the importance to cog- nitive science of understanding what it means to “do the same thing” in contexts that are different. In these examples, the melody repeatedly “does the same thing,” even though the harmonic contexts change. According to Fig. 12. Two possible alternative melodic continuations that might be imagined by experi- enced listeners upon hearing the beginning of Figure 9. </page> <page sequence="18"> 368 Steve Larson the theory of musical forces, the meaning of “same” depends on how pat- terns are internally represented (i.e., what they are “heard as”) in musical memory. If the pattern of measure one is heard as an embellishment of the third scale degree, then we expect a continuation that gives us a D  in mea- sure 5 (as in Figure 12a). If the same pattern is heard as an embellishment of the third of its chord, then we expect a continuation that gives us a G in measure 5 (as in Figure 12b). Other musical forces shape these expectations, too. When, in measure 1, we hear D–E –D in the context of B  major, we may say to ourselves “I knew it would go that way—gravity and magnetism both pulled the me- ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ lodic beginning 3–4–? back to 3.” The same pattern 3–4–3 provides the overall structure of the continuations listed in Figure 12 as well as of ^ Akiyoshi’s melody (in all cases, measures 1–8 elaborate 3, measures 9–10 ^ ^ elaborate 4, and measure 11 resolves back to 3). But when the same begin- ^ ^ ^ ning continues in a different way as 3–4–5 (in Figure 12b, measure 4, and, as we will see later, in Akiyoshi’s melody, measures 1–5), we can still say to ourselves “I knew it would go that way—inertia pulled the melodic begin- ^ ^ ^ ning 3–4–? up to 5.” But the melodies in Figure 12 are “too predictable.” According to the argument advanced here concerning the anticipation of retrospection, lis- teners familiar with modern jazz in general or with Akiyoshi’s writing in particular, in addition to expecting something like these continuations, will also expect the melody to depart from their expectations. In other words, we expect to be fooled. We even anticipate looking back and saying “I knew that I would be fooled that way” (this would be an example of Browne’s “anticipation of retrospection”). The theory advanced here sug- gests that we will expect the melody to depend for its rhetorical and ges- tural meanings upon the specific ways in which it departs from expecta- tions that we will be happy in the end to attribute to some fictional listener who is “almost as hip” as we are. One way in which we might expect to be fooled involves the device of rhythmic displacement (Folio, 1995; Larson, 1997–98b, in press-b; Strunk, 1998; Waters, 1996). Two ways of creating rhythmic displacement are “ac- centual shifting” and “polymeter.” In measures 3–5, we hear both. As Fig- ure 13 shows, those measures present a lick (B –D –E  as eighth–quarter– quarter) that we can hear as a modified version of the opening motive. The pitch modification (D  for D) is one we can tell ourselves we expected (see Figure 12a, measure 2), but the final note is omitted. And because that lick is repeated every three beats, it implies a triple meter that conflicts with the underlying quadruple meter. Figure 13 shows this polymeter. The numbers below the staff show the underlying quadruple meter. The higher row of numbers above the staff shows the implicit triple meter that listeners might first attribute to these </page> <page sequence="19"> Musical Forces, Melodic Expectation, and Jazz Melody 369 Fig. 13. Rhythmic displacement in Toshiko Akiyoshi’s “I Ain’t Gonna Ask No More,” measures 3–5.  The numbers below the staff show the notated meter.  The numbers above the staff show two ways to hear the passage in triple meter. measures upon recognizing the repetition. The lower row of numbers above the staff shows a different hearing of the implicit triple meter that listener might retrospectively attribute to these measures upon hearing the repeated lick as a variation of the opening motive (i.e., with the final note accented but withheld until the third statement of the motive). Inertia leads us to expect such polymeters to continue indefinitely. But our desire for metric stability and our preference for simple shapes leads us to expect that the implicit triple meter will bring us back in line with the underlying quadruple meter. For these reasons, and because we can hear this lick as an incomplete version of the opening motive, we may expect a D –B  in eighth notes on the downbeat of measure 5. Instead, Akiyoshi gives us E–B . The effect is a wonderful one. As with many musically effective surprises, the music not only offers a single “most expected” continuation, it also offers us a way to say to ourselves (in retro- spect) that we anticipated that surprise. Here, the musical force of inertia (to which our attention has been heightened through the riff-like repetition of the motive) suggests that the ascending D –E  should continue its ascent (recall the discussion of Figure 12b, measure 4). Although the anticipated tone of such an ascent would be F, the E that Akiyoshi wrote may be heard either as an inflected F (as an F ) or as a note still on its way to F (as an E). Figure 10c shows how Akiyoshi’s melody realizes this second interpreta- tion at a deeper level of musical structure (see the beamed notes in mea- sures 3–7, D –E –E–F). At the same time, a confirmation appears in the surface of the music (see the beamed notes in Figure 10b, measures 6–7, D –E –E–F) that retraces the steps of this pattern as it is completed at the deeper level. At the same time, the melodic line “reaches over” with G–G –F so that two lines converge on the target F of measure 7. Note that Schenker’s term “reaching over” (meaning that a “new voice” appears above those shown as more basic in the analysis) captures well the character of this gesture and reflects the metaphor of music as motion. Note also that this motion leads into measure 7 with a descending motion whose inertia carries into the descent that begins in measure 7 (F–E –D). </page> <page sequence="20"> 370 Steve Larson Fig. 14. Similarities between Toshiko Akiyoshi’s “I Ain’t Gonna Ask No More,” measures 1, 6–7, and 7–8. Figure 14 shows the similarities between the opening motive, the lick that leads into measure 7, and the immediately following lick. But there is more here than mere similarity—the developing variations that connect these lines also tell a story. As suggested earlier, the music in measures 6–7 sounds like a version of the opening motive: transformed by the inflection of D to D , changed so that it ascends to F instead of descending to D, and embellished with a reaching over G–G –F. If this is how we understand the relationship between measures 6 and 7, the resemblance shown between measure 1 and measures 6 and 7 is a coincidence—a kind of musical pun that we probably don’t “get” when we first hear it. So when the lick in measures 6 and 7 is further developed through the modification of its pick- ups and the sequential extension of its stepwise descending third as in measues 7 and 8, it will seem like it is, in one sense, even further from the opening motive. Yet, at the same time, these changes transform it into some- thing almost identical to the opening motive. In terms of the metaphor of music as motion, we seem to have traveled to more and more distant places and then discovered that we are back where we started. In terms of the metaphor of music as language, we seem to hear a series of logically connected arguments that takes us back to our original idea. Of course, Haydn has a well-deserved reputation for effec- tively exploiting this trick of “surprising us with something we originally expected.” But Akiyoshi is not alone among jazz musicians in exploiting this trick (see Larson, 1996a, on Parker). We could ask more questions, for example, about how the bass part in measures 1 and 3 anticipates and then echoes the trombone part in mea- sure 2, about how the bass part in measure 2 anticipates the Eb–E–F of the trombone part in measures 4–7, about how the bass part in measures 7–10 uses the musical forces to create a sense of inevitable momentum with the compound melody shown by the pair of beams in the lower system of Fig- ure 10c, about how the climax of Akiyoshi’s melody in measures 9–11 refers to the opening motive on more than one structural level, or about </page> <page sequence="21"> Musical Forces, Melodic Expectation, and Jazz Melody 371 how the turnaround in measures 11–13 is a confirmation that seems to echo the basic structure of the whole chorus. But I hope that enough has been said to suggest how the theory of musical forces may enhance the analysis of “I Ain’t Gonna Ask No More.” Charlie Parker’s “Confirmation” Having introduced the concept of “confirmation,” I can’t resist asking how these ideas would apply to the Charlie Parker composition “Confir- mation.” The basic structure of “Confirmation” is given in Figure 15. Fig- ure 16 gives more detail. Fig. 15. Analysis of Charlie Parker’s “Confirmation,” overview. </page> <page sequence="22"> 372 Steve Larson Fig. 16. Analysis of Charlie Parker’s “Confirmation,” detail and transcription. Again, these figures follow guidelines for “strict use” of analytic nota- tion (Larson 1996c).4 Figure 16f gives my composite transcription (from two recordings, Parker, 1947 and 1953) of Parker’s melody, together with lead-sheet symbols that describe the basic harmonies. The lower staff of Figure 16e includes the roots of all those chords. The upper staff of Figure 16e includes all the notes given in Figure 16f. With very few exceptions, the notes with stems in Figure 16e belong to the seventh chords described with lead-sheet symbols in Figure 16f. In other words, the notes that are embel- lished are the tones of the given chords, with immediate resolution of the embellishing tones in most cases. The exceptions are “tensions” (mostly “ninths”) that are embellished before they resolve or whose resolutions are 4. Figure 15a is an exception. Not in strict use, it uses the full complement of Schenkerian analytic symbols to summarize the information given in Figure 15b–e. </page> <page sequence="23"> Musical Forces, Melodic Expectation, and Jazz Melody 373 Fig. 16. (Continued) delayed until the next chord arrives. Stem direction indicates instances of compound melody. All the stemmed notes of Figure 16e appear (as stemmed or unstemmed notes) in Figure 16d. Notice how completely Parker’s com- pound melodic structures represent the sound of the chords. The remain- ing levels (Figure 15a–e and Figures 16a–c, note that Figure 16a repro- duces Figure 15e) indicate the relatively straightforward connection between Parker’s harmonies and the basic structure inherent in the form. An exhaustive analysis of the contribution of musical forces to the gestural and rhetorical shape of this composition is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, I offer here a few remarks about how the text on which the analysis is based ought to be such a Schenkerian analysis, and I note how that analysis reveals a number of hidden repetitions of the “confirmation” type. I described Figure 16f as a “composite transcription.” To create it, I first transcribed into musical notation the opening and closing choruses of both </page> <page sequence="24"> 374 Steve Larson Fig. 16. (Continued) recordings cited. Those four choruses are quite a bit alike. In most cases, the differences may be described as the inclusion or omission of embellish- ments. Figure 17 illustrates this point. Figure 17a is taken from the first chorus of the live recording (Parker, 1947). Figure 17b is taken from the first chorus of the studio recording (Parker, 1953). Figure 17a does not include the turn or trill on B  that is included in Figure 17b, and Figure 17b omits the repetition of the final F. Figure 17c shows another way to notate Figure 17b; it represents the embellishment on Bb as such through the use of a conventional symbol, and it suggests that the final note is optional. (Parker seems to omit it in favor of beginning his solo on that recording a little earlier—he puts it back in at the end of the final chorus of the same recording.) In other words, in order to make the transcription, one must answer the questions “Should the notation include this ornament?” and “Should the notation indicate that this embellishment is an ornament?” Of course, a </page> <page sequence="25"> Musical Forces, Melodic Expectation, and Jazz Melody 375 Fig. 16. (Continued) Schenkerian analysis may be regarded as a way to answer these questions in the affirmative for every note of the performance. “Confirmation” begins with a passage that is based on the descending third A–G–F (see Figure 16c), the bracket labeled “a.” That third is elabo- rated as a six-note motive A–G–B –A–G–F (see Figure 16d), the bracket labeled “b”. But that six-note motive ends with the same A–G–F (see Fig- ure 16d), the bracket labeled “a.” Thus it ends with a confirmation; both versions of the three-note motive end together. Although this hidden rep- etition may add to the perceived momentum of the line and contribute to its logic by rewarding the retrospection of anticipation, it is, by itself, nei- ther unusual or particularly astonishing. More remarkable is the fact that the immediately following music presents (as a kind of parenthetical aside) the same embedded structures in a completely different rhythm (see the brackets above Figures 16d and e, measures 3–4). Further examination of </page> <page sequence="26"> 376 Steve Larson Fig. 16. (Continued) Figures 15 and 16 confirms that these motives play important roles through- out this piece. Jazz Melody As Empirical Evidence The theory of musical forces suggests that our experience of musical motion is analogous to our experience of physical motion. Regardless of whether or not we are consciously aware of physical forces, we experience their constant shaping of physical motions. Likewise, regardless of whether or not we are consciously aware of musical forces, we experience their constant shaping of musical motions. And just as we can quantify the in- teraction of physical forces, we can quantify the interaction of musical forces. </page> <page sequence="27"> Musical Forces, Melodic Expectation, and Jazz Melody 377 Fig. 16. (Continued) In an earlier issue of this journal, Jamshed Bharucha (1996) explored magnetic pulls by analyzing the resolution of dissonance in a piece by Mozart. Adopting a similar approach here allows us to quantify the inter- action of musical forces. We begin by looking at all the pieces analyzed in this article. That in- cludes Akiyoshi’s “I Ain’t Gonna Ask No More” (as represented in Figures 10 and 11) and Parker’s “Confirmation” (as represented in Figures 15 and 16). But it also includes Parker’s improvisation on “Oh, Lady Be Good!” (as represented in Figure 1 and in the Schenkerian analyses appearing in Larson, 1996a) and Evans’s improvisations on “Who Can I Turn To?” and on “All of You” (as represented in Figures 3 and 8, respectively). The result is that we have a sample that includes every published Schenkerian analysis of a jazz improvisation that has been rendered in “strict use of analytic notation.” </page> <page sequence="28"> 378 Steve Larson Fig. 16. (Continued) We then compile a list of all the dissonance resolutions that occur within patterns in which we can meaningfully compare the effects of the musical forces. Here that means patterns that meet the following criteria: (1) every pattern moves entirely by step (within a step collection that is the chord scale for the chord that supports that pattern); (2) every pattern is three notes long; (3) every pattern begins on a chord tone, moves to a nonchord tone, and ends with a chord tone—and the chord is always a triad or sev- enth chord; (4) every pattern’s second note (the nonchord tone) lies be- tween two chord tones that are a third apart. There are three ways to fill a third with a step collection (these are called “species of thirds” in Larson, 1992 and Hurwitz &amp; Larson, 1994). A ma- jor third must be filled with two whole steps. We’ll describe this shape with the nomenclature of pitch-class-set analysis as “0 2 4” (meaning a collec- tion of notes 0, 2, and 4 semitones above a given pitch). A minor third </page> <page sequence="29"> Musical Forces, Melodic Expectation, and Jazz Melody 379 Fig. 16. (Continued) Fig. 17.

The numbers in the second, third, and fourth columns indicate pitches.  The lowest note is called “0.”  The notes above it are labeled by the number of semitones that they lie above the note called “0.”  The table also indicates the number of times each pattern occurs in the sample as well as the gravity score (G), the magnetism score (M), and the inertia score (I) for each pattern. half step, then we have “0 2 3.” Thus, there are three such “species of thirds.” The first two notes of any of our three-note patterns may be regarded as a question. The third note may be regarded as the answer. For any species of third, there are two possible questions (starting on the upper note of the third or starting on the lower note). Given our three species of thirds, this makes six possible questions. Each question has two possible answers (end- ing on the upper note of the third or ending on the lower note). Given our six possible questions, this makes 12 possible patterns. Table 1 lists all 12 patterns that meet the criteria just listed. Table 1 also lists the distributions of these patterns within our sample. As noted earlier, one advantage of strict use is that each note of embellish- ment appears as an unstemmed notehead in a slurred figure at one and only one level of structure. As a result, the identification of patterns that meet the three criteria just listed is relatively straightforward. In the analy- ses just listed, there are 44 such patterns.5 We then test the hypothesis that the frequency with which any of those patterns occurs is a function of the sum of musical forces acting on that 5. Where a pattern appears two or three times verbatim because of a repetition de- manded by the AABA form of the piece, the pattern is counted only once. </page> <page sequence="31"> Musical Forces, Melodic Expectation, and Jazz Melody 381 TABLE 2 Results of Multiple Regression Analysis for Musical Forces Feature Value Multiple regression analysis R = .897 p = .003 N = 12 Gravity w  = 4.667 G p = .006 Magnetism (half-step) wM = 3.125 p = .047 Inertia w  = 4.667 I p = .006 Constant K = -2.042 p = .121 NOTE—The analysis seeks the coefficients (w) in the equation F = w G + G w M I M  + w KI  + , so that F, the net force acting on the second note in a three-note pattern, predicts the frequency with which that pattern occurs. G is that pattern’s gravity score, M is its magnetism score, and I is its inertia score. pattern. In other words, we ask how well we can predict the distribution of those patterns by using the formula F = w G + w M + w I + K G M I where F is the sum of musical forces acting on the second note in the pat- tern; G is its gravity score (1 if it descends and 0 if it ascends); M is its magnetism score (1 if it resolves by half step, 0 if it does not6); I is its inertia score (1 if it continues in the same direction and 0 if it does not); K is a constant; and the coefficients w , w , and w  are weights that describe the G M I relative contributions of each force, respectively. Table 1 also gives the grav- ity, magnetism, and inertia scores for each of the patterns listed in that example. The statistical technique of multiple regression answers this question by finding the values of the weights (represented by the coeffi- cients w , w , and w  in the preceding formula) that produce the best G M I correlation between F and the number of occurrences of each of the 12 patterns. Table 2 shows the results of the multiple regression analysis. The results provide striking support the theory of musical forces. The high R value (.897) means that the three forces, taken together, can account for a great deal of the variation in the data. (R quantifies the correla- tion between two different sets of numbers of the same length. An R of 6. In previous statistical analyses of musical forces, the score for magnetism considers the distance to the tone of resolution and the distance to the tone in the opposite direction. Here, the simpler question—“Does the pattern resolve by half step?”—gives a better result. </page> <page sequence="32"> 382 Steve Larson +1 means that the first set of numbers changes in the same way as the second set—that is, corresponding numbers go up or down in propor- tionate amounts. An R of 0 means that there is no relationship between the two sets of numbers. And an R of -1 means that they change in opposite directions.) The weights (4.667, 3.125, and 4.667) are all large enough to suggest that each force contributes significantly to explain- ing the result. (The similarity in weights for gravity and magnetism is a coincidence; there is no reason these numbers should be precisely the same.) The low p values mean that R and w values this high for data sets of this size are unlikely to have occurred by chance. (The p for a given R is the probability that an R at least this high would occur by chance—that is, the chance that the same or higher R would occur if one of the sets consisted of random numbers. By convention, p values below .05 are considered statistically significant.) The sample of jazz melodies from which these patterns have been drawn is small and may not be representative of all jazz melody. So one should be cautious in extending the findings described here to a broader repertoire. As more jazz melodies are transcribed and analyzed, researchers can ask how well the model offered here describes the distribution of patterns within those melodies. But the fact that these data can be modeled so well by the interaction of constantly acting but contextually determined musical forces adds support to the growing body of evidence that we experience musical motions metaphorically in terms of our experience of physical motions.
