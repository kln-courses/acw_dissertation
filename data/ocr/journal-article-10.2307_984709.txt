<plain_text><page sequence="1">A STUDY OF SYMMETRY IN THE CENTRECHINOIDEA, BASED ON BEHAVIOR, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO LYTECHINUS VARIEGATUS; I INCLUDING A SHORT DISCUSSION OF LINGUISTIC DIFFICULTIES IN DESCRIBING BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA RODERICK MACDONALD THE MATERIAL for this study was collected during June and July, I934, in the waters known as the Reach, opposite the Bermuda Biological Station. The observations were made sometimes in the laboratory of the Bermuda Biological Station, sometimes in the waters outside. Lytechinus is the most common of the sea urchins found in the waters of Bermuda. It is gregarious and is found in considerable numbers among rocks (below high tide level), but occurs in greatest abundance on a sandy bottom, usually one fairly well covered with seaweed, and in shallow water (i to 2 fms.). Several specimens of Lytechinus, watched while in cap- tivity, were observed to move in such a way that they ap- peared to have a definite axis of locomotion. So consistent was this behaviour that it suggested a locomotor bilateral symmetry in these animals, a condition-so far as is known- not heretofore observed in the regular Echinoidea. It there- fore seemed worth while to test this by experiment. In the first place, the method of locomotion in Lytechinus was determined. An animal was placed in a circular glass- bottomed vessel about I2 inches in diameter and 3 inches deep filled with sea water. This was placed on a glass- topped table. The animal's walking movements were then observed from below. The spines used in walking are those on either side of the forward half of the oral surface, except for those in the immediate vicinity of the peristome. During 1 See Clark, H. L. 1933. 87</page><page sequence="2">88 RODERICK MACDONALD walking, these latter spines bend over the mouth and the soft tissues surrounding it. When viewed from below, the walk- ing spines are seen to swing outwards and up and forward, and then down until they come in contact with the surface on which the animal is moving; the spines then move back and thus complete the cycle; in this process, they push the animal forward. In other words, the walking spines on one side of the forward half move clockwise, and those on the other side move counterclockwise. It was also observed that the spines on either side of inter- ambulacral groove 5, which lies at the forward end of the axis of locomotion, spread apart, forming two rows, one on either side of the axis. The spines in each row take up the circu- lating movements, corresponding in direction to those of the ambulatory spines on the same side of the locomotor axis. When the animal is walking, the aboral surface slopes down- ward from the forward end to the hind end. The tube feet do not seem to take an active part in walk- ing. All the tube feet on the half of the animal that is fore- most during walking are extended and move around in an exploratory manner. If one is cut off, all the others are drawn in. After about two minutes they are again extended, most of them appearing at that end of the locomotor axis which in the succeeding walking movements will be the for- ward end. In beginning the experiments on Lytechinus, a zinc table 6 feet by 2 feet, with 4-inch raised edges, was used. This was kept filled with running salt water, so that when the urchins, half an hour after being collected, were placed on the table they were completely covered with the water, their aboral surfaces being 2 inch to i inch below the surface. The long side of the table lay below a southwest window; at no time did direct sunlight fall on any part of the table. Specimens were placed at one end of this table, one for each observation, and as soon as they began to move in a definite forward direc- tion, their anterior ends were marked. Coloured crayon, insoluble in water, was found to be a satisfactory marker. Each animal was observed to keep a straight course until it</page><page sequence="3">STUDY OF SYMMIETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 89 came to the obstructing walls of the table, then it either remained at rest for some time or immediately turned its anterior end clockwise or counterclockwise through an angle measuring up to 90 degrees, and then proceeded forward again. In no case did an animal completely reverse its direction of movement under these circumstances; as will be shown later, a more violent type of disturbance was required to cause a reversal. If, while moving in a straight line, an urchin were rotated through i8o degrees, it moved off in the new direction, its anterior end pointing forward as before. In one or two cases an urchin walked the length of the table three or four times in succession (I8 to 24 feet) in a straight line, being turned through i8o degrees whenever it reached the obstructing end of the table. After the animals had been on the laboratory table for some time, say two days, it was noted that even without meeting any obstruction they frequently changed their course, the result being that they made a meandering track; but they continued to move with their anterior ends, as marked, pointing forward. From observations of this kind, made with a large number of specimens, the supposed antero-posterior axis of locomo- tion was decided upon. This axis is shown as A in Fig. i. Although the animals commonly moved with the A + (i.e. the anterior) end of the A axis pointed forward, some of them occasionally altered their direction of locomotion, proceeding to move either with the B + end of the B axis or the C + end of the C axis (see Fig. i) pointing forward. However, it was noted that after moving forward four or five inches with either B + or C + directed forward an animal resumed loco- motion with the A + end of the A4 axis pointing forward. Moreover, the direction of locomotion on the A axis tended to remain consistently with A + forward. If, when an animal was moving forward, its "anterior" end (i.e. the A + end of the J axis) were moved slowly through any angle up to i8o degrees, it almost invariably moved forward again not only on the same axis but with the anterior (A +) end still directed forward. There were a few specimens which, when first put on the table, moved with the A - end of the A axis</page><page sequence="4">90 RODERICK -MACDONALD B- Ar: O, IAf~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ X6 FIG. i. Aboral view of a specimen of Lytechinus variegatus, with ambulacral and interambulacral areas shown numbered. (See text.) forward, but their direction of locomotion was more easily reversed than was that of the specimens which started out with the A + end of the A axis directed forward. The determination of the anterior and posterior ends of the axis was as follows: it was observed that when an animal moved before being experimented upon, one end of the axis was directed forward much more frequently than the other, and this was therefore called the anterior (A +) end. It may be mentioned here as worthy of note that the locomotor anterior end of the axis of Lytechinus (A +) is the reverse of what is found in the irregular echinoids, where the locomotor anterior is the A - end of the A axis.</page><page sequence="5">STUDY OF SYMMETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 91 Experiment: Axis and Direction Rotations in Horizontal Plane Axis and Direc- + Anterior 3 or 4 minutes elapsed between shifts, whether tion after Dis- - = Posterior they were voluntary or mechanical turbance A + . 2 Counterclockwise A + A + . 2 Clockwise A - A - . 3 Clockwise A - A- . 4 Clockwise (and then animal turned A - its anterior end through 450 in a clockwise direction) A Animal voluntarily altered to B axis B - B 2 .

Few specimens were found which approached this animal in its persistence in main- taining the same axis of locomotion despite mechanical disturbance. In this case it is worthy of note that not only was the axis adhered to the A axis, but the direction of loco- motion was so persistently A +. These results were checked by observations made in an open pool, using as subject a specimen of Lytechinus already living in the pool. The pool used had a surface area of about I20 square feet, and lay between high and low tide marks. A piece of wood 2 feet long and 8 inches wide was laid against the side of the pool to form an inclined plane completely submerged in the water. The board was variously inclined at I5?, 3o0, and 45? from the horizontal and the animal placed on the board at each inclination. In every case it moved up the inclined plane in an A + direction. It was noted that the urchin used its tube feet and spines to move up this incline. The animal was now placed on the sand-covered bottom of the pool and its direction of locomotion (A +) noted. Next it was placed on the inclined plane, which had been covered with sand, in such a way that A + was turned in a direction pointing up the plane. Immediately it traveled up the incline with the direction A +. It was noted that the animal at first attempted to use its tube feet to move up the incline, but that not being able to do this on loose sand,' it used its spines in a manner similar to that of walking hori- zontally (see page 88). The urchin, apparently with great effort, slowly walked up the incline from bottom to top (z 'As pointed out by Jennings, when discussing walking movements of starfish, . . . "while the suckers are necessary for attachment, the actual locomotion seems to occur rather by the action of the tube feet as levers, in the way described above than as cords for pulling the animal along." Jennings, H. S., "Behavior of the Starfish Asterias Forreri De Loriol." Univ. of California Publications in Zo6logy, Vol. IV, No. 2, 1907. In the conditions here being considered, not only the lever action of the tube feet but also their ability to attach themselves to the substratum are in- effective in enabling Lytechinus to walk up the sand-covered inclined plane.</page><page sequence="7">STUDY OF SYMIMETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 93 feet), the supporting spines occasionally slipping, which re- sulted in the path being zig zag. However, the animal always kept in an A + direction. It was noted that while it was moving upward, the tube feet at the forward end were ex- tended and continually waving from side to side, like so many "feelers." On arriving at the top, the animal was turned around so that the A + end of the axis was pointing down the incline. The urchin did not slide down, but slowly, by means of its spines as before, walked to the bottom of the incline (2 feet), keeping a straight course approximately parallel to the long edge of the board. It was next placed half way up the incline, with its A axis at right angles to the length of the board, and thereupon walked in the A + direc- tion across the board (8 inches), remaining at the edge until it was removed. This was repeated several times, always with the same result. It was noted that when the animal was at rest, all the tube feet were extended and moved from side to side. When the animal was about to walk forward, the tube feet at the anterior end (ambulacra I and V) were stretched horizontally forward, the other tube feet more or less hanging down the side of the animal. In this experiment, Lytechinus shows no signs of geotactic reaction. Furthermore, altering the center of gravity of the animal does not change its axis of locomotion. When specimens of Lytechinus are placed in a glass-sided aquarium, they proceed to climb the walls. It was seen that the specimens studied climbed primarily by using their tube feet, at the same time making efforts to use their spines. On this smooth surface, the spines were not nearly so effective as when used on a rough bottom. The urchins continually slipped as they tried to move upward on their spines. The direction of the slips was carefully noted in the case of a large number of specimens, and the relative positions of the animals about their A axes were marked on the glass walls. The conclusion was that these sea urchins were attempting to walk up the glass wall on the A axis. When an animal reached the surface of the water, it remained just below the surface</page><page sequence="8">94 RODERICK MACDONALD indefinitely unless disturbed. In this position of rest, the A axis pointed vertically or lay at most 3o0 to either side of the vertical. If an animal was turned through I800, it would immediately commence to walk down the wall of the aqua- rium, apparently making every effort to keep on the A axis. Experiments already described show that if sufficiently dis- turbed, these sea urchins are able to reverse their direction of movement, but in this situation (clinging to the side of an aquarium) they never did so. In short, gravity does not ap- pear to be a strongly disturbing factor in their movements. When an 8-inch piece of coral rock with overhanging sides (Fig. 2) was placed in the aquarium, completely submerged, it C, FIG. 2. was found that some of the sea urchins, instead of walking around it, walked up its side. On reaching the top, they rotated and moved about for an hour or so, apparently mak- ing no effort to move down. Ultimately they walked to the edge, released their tube-feet hold, and fell to the bottom. Then a piece of rock with sides the slope of which was not more than 450 (Fig. 3) was placed in the path of the sea urchins. This time not only did some of them climb up, but they promptly walked down the other side.</page><page sequence="9">STUDY OF SYMMETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 95 From these experiments it is concluded that Lytechinus shows no signs of geotactic reaction, but climbs the walls of an aquarium or any other obstruction seeking a suitable environment. As will be seen later, there is evidence to show that Lytechinus climbs the walls of an aquarium in the course of exploratory journeys for food, or for a substratum on which its food is usually found in its natural environment. The next experiment made was as follows: A string was placed from one end of the aquarium to the other, below the surface of the water. A sea urchin was placed so that its FIG 3 oral surface just touched the middle of the length of string. In about i minute the animal's tube feet were extended and the string was firmly grasped. The animal hung, aboral side down, for eight hours. Finally it moved along the string by means of its tube feet as far as the end, where it settled on the side of the aquarium. It was once more placed with its oral surface touching the middle of the string, its aboral sur- face facing downwards. Pieces of shell were presented to it and were immediately grasped by the tube feet. With its aboral surface covered with the pieces of shell, it again moved along the string to the side of the aquarium. Two specimens were now suspended from the string, some distance apart. They presently approached one another and passed, going to opposite ends of the string.</page><page sequence="10">96 RODERICK MACDONALD Next a specimen was suspended from the middle of the string and then another presented, mouth first, to the aboral side of the first individual. The latter could not be made to take hold. A shell was now presented to the aboral surface of the first urchin and was immediately grasped by its tube feet. The second specimen was again presented, mouth first, to the region whereon hung the shell. Immediately it took hold of the shell with its tube feet. A shell was now put on the aboral surface of the second animal and a third specimen at- tached itself to this. Thus three sea urchins, all of the same size (diam. 3 cm.), were hanging one below the other from the string. After about half an hour, they made efforts to right themselves: the bottom animal walked up over the other two and started to walk along the top of the string, but gravity pulled it over and it moved along suspended by its tube feet, its aboral surface facing downwards. It continued until it reached the side of the aquarium; the second animal followed the same procedure; and finally the first urchin traveled to the end of the string. It is interesting to note that the first animal never loosed its hold on its piece of shell, even when it was supporting the weight of the other two animals. Similarly the second urchin continued to cling to its shell, after the third urchin had grasped it. It is also interesting to observe that in climbing up to the string, the second and third urchins actually took hold of the spines of the other urchins, whereas at first they would not attach themselves to the aboral side of another without a shell between them. (It has been observed throughout these experiments and also in the natural environment of these animals (Lytechinus) that only when walking do they pick up debris with their tube feet.) During this experiment, all specimens moved on their oral surfaces, irrespective of their consequent positional rela- tionship to gravitational pull. In short, it would appear that the impulse to apply their oral sides to a solid surface is what conditions this position to be the normal, rather than a re- sponse to gravity; in other words, movements made to regain</page><page sequence="11">STUDY OF SYMMETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 97 this position may be described, in part, as stereotactic, and not geotactic. Further observations were now made on what might be called the righting movements of a number of specimens. Each animal, while under water on the laboratory table, was turned over and made to rest on its aboral surface; whereupon all the spines became active and perpendicular to its surface. Presently the tube feet in the region of the A + end of the locomotor axis, i.e. in ambulacra I and V, became active and fully extended. They attached themselves to the solid substratum and gradually pulled the body of the animal over until the A axis was perpendicular to the table. During this process, as soon as the tube feet nearer the mouth were brought close enough to the table, they also attached themselves to its surface and helped to pull the animal in the same direction. Once the animal had attained the vertical position, i.e. once its A axis was vertical, the spines on the rows of plates in inter- ambulacra 3 and 2 on the periphery of the aboral side were directed away from the A axis and began to rotate. The rotation of these spines was similar to what was found when the animal was walking in a horizontal path, the spines, when the animal was viewed from the aboral side, in interambulac- rum 3 moving clockwise and those in interambulacrum 2 moving counterclockwise. This interesting piece of behaviour seemed to aid the action of the tube feet in bringing the body of the animal far enough beyond the vertical position to enable gravity to pull it over to its natural position-that is, with its oral surface on the bottom. In other words, when an animal is laid on what is normally its "dorsal" surface, it assumes its natural position by making a back sQmersault over its anterior end. A very large number of animals were tested, and in every case the method of righting was the same, the axis about which they turned in regaining their normal posi- tion being at right angles to the A axis. The time taken to do this varied from 5 to IO minutes. It is important to note that not only is the righting move- ment as restricted as locomotion, but also that in every case</page><page sequence="12">98 RODERICK MACDONALD studied, and repeatedly with the same animal, the righting movement was made about the anterior end (A +) of the locomotor axis. In order to find out what effect, if any, light had in the movements of Lytechinus, an aquarium 2 feet by i foot, i foot deep, was fitted out with a wooden bottom and a glass window 4 inches square at floor level at one end of the tank. By otherwise making the aquarium light-tight, a beam of sunlight coming in through the window was obtained. The aquarium was filled with circulating sea water and a specimen placed at the far end from the window. Immediately, and traveling almost three times as quickly (about 9 inches per minute) as on the shallow table used in earlier experiments, the animal made a straight path, with A + forward, to the window. It then climbed up the window and remained there, fastened by the tube feet on its oral surface, although there was no mechanical obstacle to prevent it from climbing to the top of that wall of the aquarium. It was noted that in no case did the animal climb up the sides of the aquarium apart from this making for the small window. Several animals were used, with the same results. In aquaria similar in size to that described above, with four glass walls, situated in diffuse daylight or in direct sunlight, and no matter what the condition of aeration, the animals always climbed up the sides of the aquarium. If this had a sand bottom and was set out in the open in the sunlight, the urchins remained on the bottom. It may be that the photosensitive zone of the animal is in the region of the mouth, since in directional sunlight in the otherwise darkened aquarium, Lytechinus not only walked to the window but also tilted itself until its mouth was pressed against the glass, where it remained. In the lighted aquarium, with a sand bottom, the light was reflected up around the mouth of the animal and was perhaps sufficiently intense to stimulate the photosensitive region and thus keep the animal on the bottom. This matter will be discussed later, the important point to notice here being that the loco-</page><page sequence="13">STUDY OF SYMMETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 99 motor axis of Lytechinus when moving in response to a light stimulus was the A axis and the direction was A +. Four specimens of Lytechinus were now placed in a glass-walled aquarium of the same dimensions as that used previously, and with the floor made of wood; this was put in the open, with one glass side facing south. The aquarium was filled with circulating salt water. At 5.30 p.m. the sky was cloudless, and the urchins were climbing up the glass sides of the aquarium toward the sun. Sand from the beach was now placed on the bottom of the aquarium, and in half an hour the urchins had come down from the sides and were resting on the sandy bottom. The sand was next cleared from half of the bottom and the aquarium placed so that both halves of the bottom were equally lighted by the sun. Two specimens were put on each half. After three quarters of an hour, the two on the bare wood were climbing the glass side, while the two on the sandy half of the bottom were still there and mak- ing no attempt to climb. In these experiments it was noted that the light of the sun was so intense that it apparently overshot stimulation value and actually resulted in the urchins moving into the shade, whereas the light from a cloudy sky or diffused light was such that the urchin's phototactic threshold value was undershot and the animal appeared neither negatively nor positively phototactic. The earlier experiments were conducted under the latter condition. Six specimens of Lytechinus were now placed in the aqua- rium, the bottom being covered with ground coral rock such as is used in Bermuda for building purposes. This was de- void of any organic matter. The aquarium was put out in the open and exposed to sunlight and kept filled with circulat- ing sea water. The animals remained on the bottom for 6 days and at about this time showed signs of weakness. When disturbed they would barely respond, moving very slowly. They were found climbing the glass sides of the tank with what appeared to be great effort, and were dropping the</page><page sequence="14">100 RODERICK MACDONALD debris-shells, pieces of coral, and alga-commonly found held on their aboral surfaces by their tube feet (pp. 95, 96). Two dead fish were now put in the aquarium and the sea urchins were taken from the walls and placed on the fish. Immediately they attached themselves to the fish by their tube feet. After some time (24 hours), one urchin was seen to be clinging to the end of the tank, at the same time holding onto the tail of one of the fish, which being filled with air was tending to pull both its own carcass and the sea urchin to the surface. Pushed off the wall of the aquarium, the urchin dropped to the bottom, still holding the fish's tail. The buoyancy of the fish kept the urchin in a tilted position. This, together with the fact that it was unable to attach its tube feet to the bottom of the tank covered with the ground coral, and the fact that it could not get enough of its tube feet on the fish to pull the latter down to a favorable position, resulted in the observation that in about two minutes the urchin was forced to release its hold and the fish floated to the surface. After ten days, it was found that the urchins were all walking on the bottom and apparently were again strong and vigorous, as indicated by their active response to me- chanical disturbance and also by the fact that their aboral surfaces were covered with debris. It was noticed that two of them had pieces of the bones of the dead fish on their aboral surfaces, the flesh of the fish having entirely disappeared. This had not all been eaten by the urchins, but some of it had disintegrated and mixed with the sand, which the urchins were now eating. From this experiment it is learned that if the bottom of the tank is covered with sand, the animals remain on the bottom for several days. This is in striking contrast to what happens if the same animals are put in a tank with a bare wooden bottom. In this case they im- mediately walk up the walls of the tank. If, however, no food is in the sand, the animals will ultimately climb the walls. When food is placed in the sand, they will remain on the bottom, making no effort to climb. A common habit of Lytechinus, which it shares with some other sea urchins, notably Strongylocentrotus dr6bachiensis,</page><page sequence="15">STUDY OF SYMMETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 101 is to cover its aboral surface with debris; this it does by means of its tube feet. It was considered worth while to find out if possible what might be the interpretation of this behaviour, if any. When healthy specimens of Lytechinus which have been freed from debris on their aboral surface are placed in their natural environment or in a salt water aquarium, they immediately set about covering their aboral surfaces with any debris which may be around. In their natural environment they cover themselves with pieces of coral, shell, and algax. In the aquarium, they have frequently picked up in this way pieces of glass tubing and pebbles. It has been observed throughout these experiments and also in the natural en- vironment of these animals, that only when walking does Lytechinus pick up debris with its tube feet and place it on its aboral surface. It is true that covering itself with debris is a fairly successful method of hiding the animal from human observation, but whether or not this is the case so far as the sensory equipment of possible enemies is concerned, no evi- dence is available to say. The covering activity seems to be incidental to normal walking activities. Several experiments were made in an endeavor to learn something about the nervous control of locomotion. Oxalic acid crystals were placed on the anterior end of the X axis of several specimens in the aquarium. After a few seconds they all traveled rapidly with the posterior ends (A -) of their axes pointing forward. Similarly, when oxalic acid was placed on the A - end of the axis, the animals traveled equally rapidly with the A + end forward. When, however, the acid was placed on one side of the axis, the animal merely rotated about the axis perpendicular to the A axis away from the source of irritation, remaining in one place. A cut was now made across the A axis in the soft tissue about the mouth of one specimen, so as to cut the base of the radial nerves running along ambulacra I and V. Oxalic acid was placed on the animal's test at the A - end of the A4 axis. The animal immediately moved along the A axis in the A + direction, apparently in an endeavor to escape from the irritation of the acid. The cut and the placement</page><page sequence="16">102 RODERICK MACDONALD of the acid were then reversed in relation to the A axis. The result was as before, that the walking movements per- formed ordinarily by the walking spines along the sides of the animal were unhindered by any loss of nervous co6rdination. In the third of this group of experiments, the cut was made on one side of the A axis, that is, cutting the base of the radial nerves along ambulacra II, IV, V and I thus cutting off all possible nerve supply to one physiological half of the animal. Oxalic acid was placed over the A - end of the locomotor axis, and instead of the animal's walking away from the source of irritation, the walking spines on the side of the A axis opposite the cut carried out normal walking movements, while the walking spines on the side of the cut moved in such a way that no real walking movements were possible. As a result of this non-co6rdination on the part of the walking spines on the cut side of the axis, the animal rotated approxi- mately about its center, remaining in one place. It was thus found that by injuring the center of either of these physiolog- ical halves of the nervous system of a number of specimens of Lytechinus, a lack of co6rdination of walking movements resulted on the injured side. If, however, the cut was made across either of the ends of the A axis, which separates the physiological halves of the animal, or even across both these ends in the same animal, no lack of co6rdination of walking movements was observed. It is thus seen that the walking spines and their nervous control are bilaterally symmetrical about the A axis. In the light of these experiments it would appear that Lytechinus is functionally bilaterally symmetrical about a definite axis. Viewed aborally, this axis lies immediately to the left of the madreporite, passing through the neighbor- ing ocular plate III and the diagonally opposite genital plate 5 (Fig. i). According to Cole (I9I3), in Asteriasforbesi, the physiological anterior as he determined it lies in this same position. In the irregular Echinoidea-spatangoids and clypeastroids-it has been shown by Parker (1927), in Echin- arachnius parma, and by Crozier (I920) in Mellita sexies-</page><page sequence="17">STUDY OF SYMMETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 103 perforatus, that the axis of locomotion corresponds with the structural axis of bilateral symmetry. In the spatangoids, the author has observed the same coincidence in these axes in Echinocardium cordatum. The matter of orientation in the Echinoidea was first given serious attention by Agassiz (I836), later by Loven (I874), and more recently by Jackson (1912), Ubisch (19I3), and Gordon (I926). Loven discovered an arrangement based on the size and character of the primordial ambulacral plates in the peristomial border of irregular Echinoidea and often in the regular Echinoidea whereby one can locate the antero- posterior axis of these echinoderms. According to the findings of these investigations, this arrangement of primordial ambulacral plates is a genetic structure and does not change later in development except in the regular Echinoidea, where the arrangement disappears in the adult. The only adult member of the regular Echinoidea in which it exists, as far as is known, is the ancient Bothriocidaris archaica (Jackson), found in the Ordovician. Accordingly, in the great majority of regular Echinoidea the above law of Loven does not help in orientating these animals. As a result of Jackson's inves- tigation, a dependable method of orientating regular Echi- noidea, including adult forms, has been established. He found that during the development of the regular Echinoidea the ocular plates enter the periproct in such a sequence as to emphasize the bilateral symmetry of these Echinoidea through a definite axis, namely III, 5 (Fig. i). This axis agrees with the axis found by Loven, and also with the axis about which the irregular Echinoidea develop their patent bilateral symmetry. Finally, this axis coincides with the A axis, or locomotor axis, in the investigations described herein. As has been seen, Lytechinus can move in both directions on the locomotor axis. An anterior and posterior end are thus functionally not established, as in Mellita, and Echi- nacharincus, for example, and probably in most irregular Echinoidea. According to our observations, Lytechinus moves most commonly with the so-called structurally pos-</page><page sequence="18">104 RODERICK MACDONALD terior (A +) end of the axis (Fig. i) carried forward, and this has thus been termed the anterior end throughout the experiments. In Lytechinus the anus is eccentric, lying near to the border of the periproct in the region of interambulacrum 5 and either on the III, 5 axis or-less frequently --on the I, 3 axis. On examination the periproct of Lytechinus is seen to be cov- ered by a large number of plates, these being smallest and most numerous near the anus. The relative plasticity of the various parts of the periproct is correlated with the size and number of plates borne on these parts. When defecation takes place, the rectum is extruded and as a result of the relative size and arrangement of plates on the periproct and the consequent plasticity of the latter, the anus is carried above the level of the periproct border and is directed towards and above interambulacral groove 5, beyond the border of the periproct, thus facilitating the removal of the fecal pellets from the body of the animal. Accordingly, the anus, whether or not it is on the III, 5 axis when defecation is not taking place, is always there during this process. When the animal is moving with ambulacrum III directed forward and is about to defecate, the body, which during walking in this direction is tilted so that the aboral surface slopes downward from III to 5, is still further tilted in this direction; owing to the position of the anus as described above, and to the force of gravity, the fecal pellets, which are some- what spherical in shape, roll down interambulacral groove 5. When Lytechinus is moving with interambulacrum 5 carried forward and is about to defecate, it moves more slowly and the aboral surface, which when the animal is walking always slopes downward from the forward end, takes up a more or less horizontal position. The anus is directed over interambulacral groove 5, and the removal of the fecal pellets in this case is assisted by the neighboring spines, which by their rotation cause the pellets to roll down interambulacral groove 5 and sometimes down ambulacral groove I.</page><page sequence="19">STUDY OF SYMMETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 105 If defecation is about to take place when the animal is at rest, the body assumes the position taken when the animal walks with ambulacrum III directed forward. As has been pointed out, when the animal is walking, the aboral surface of Lytechinus slopes downward from the end carried forward. Should this end be ambulacrum III, then the getting rid of the fecal material from the surface of the body is mechanically speaking a simple matter. If the forward end is interam- bulacrum 5, defecation tends to inhibit further walking in this direction, and the removal of fecal pellets is accomplished with greater effort. Enormous quantities of material (sand with organic matter) are almost constantly being passed through the alimentary tract, so that the getting rid of fecal material is an ever-present problem to the animal. Since the fecal pellets are more easily removed during defecation when Lytechinus is walking with ambulacral groove III carried forward than when interambulacral groove 5 is carried for- ward, and also since in the latter case forward movement is arrested during defecation, it might be expected that in the course of time Lytechinus will cease to walk with inter-' ambulacral groove 5 directed forward, which is the case in the irregular Echinoidea. Our observations show that there is no indication of elimination of locomotion with interambu- lacral groove 5 directed forward. On the contrary, this direc- tion of locomotion is so common that in the above-described experiments interambulacral groove 5 has been designated the anterior of the axis of locomotion (A +). That this is the functional anterior is further supported by the fact that during righting movements Lytechinus rotates vertically about genital plate 5, with characteristic movements of the spines in that region. In addition, the anus lies toward genital plate 5; and also in the course of development the ocular plates which first travel in to the periproct and become insert are those on either side of genital plate 5. These functional, structural, and developmental specializations indicate the importance of this region and suggest that the true anterior of Lytechinus-at least as the locus of activities</page><page sequence="20">106 RODERICK MACDONALD which are generally associated with the anterior of an animal- lies in this region. It is commonly stated that sedentary animals tend to be radially symmetrical, and actively moving animals bilaterally symmetrical. The echinoderms in general have a superficial radial symmetry and show great variation in their sedentary habit. This ranges from the permanently attached adult crinoids to the actively moving ophiuroids. Both of these are radially symmetrical and according to what has been said with regard to actively moving animals, it would be expected that the ophiuroids would show signs of bilateral symmetry. It is to be noted, however, that it is the high specialization of all the arms with their articular surfaces and processes for the attachment of muscles and their consequent independent mobility that has made for the active movements of these animals. Furthermore, those appendages are well marked off from the disc, or main body of the animal, and their independence of movement is thus further enhanced. So far, there is no evidence of circumscribed directional move- ment in ophiuroids. In the asteroids the arms are not so highly specialized and are not marked off from the main body of the animal as in ophiuroids. It might be said that here is indicated a centralization of the locomotor mechanism. It is interesting to note that there is some evidence of cir- cumscribed directional movement in asteroids. In the Echinoidea the arms are completely fused to the body, indicating a further centralization of the locomotor mech- anism, which would make for a greater possibility of direc- tional movement than in the ophiuroids or the asteroids. Among the Echinoidea there is a great variation in locomotor activities. The cidarids are extremely sluggish but do move. The centrechinoids are somewhat more active. Here, how- ever, there is a difference between those living habitually on rocks and those living on hard flat sandy or pebbly bottoms, the latter being more active. Finally, the irregular echi- noids, which are among the most active of all the Echinoidea, have a well marked structural bilateral symmetry, with which</page><page sequence="21">STUDY OF SYMMETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 107 is correlated their habit of burrowing and walking with circumscribed directional movements in the sand.' Lytechinus is among the most active of the regular echi- noids. Although it is found on rocks, it occurs in large numbers on a fairly hard sandy bottom, where it may walk as many as five feet in one direction, taking half an hour to travel that distance. It is suggested that the environmental conditions, namely stretches of sandy bottom, the relative uniformity of light intensity over a wide area, and the habit of feeding on the detritus-containing sand, all tend to make explicit the functional bilateral symmetry implicit in the animal at least so far as locomotion is concerned. This gradual reestablishment of functional bilateral symmetry in Lytechinus is associated with a more clearly defined structural bilateral symmetry, evidence of which is seen in the dis- placement of the anus along the A axis. It may be that here in Lytechinus we have a condition which foreshadows or prefigures the conditions found in the irregular echinoids. Ubisch (I9I3) was the first to demonstrate the importance of the II, 4 axis (Fig. i) in the symmetry of Echinoidea. He found that the calcareous skeleton of the imagines of regular and irregular echinoids are bilaterally symmetrical about this axis, which he called the primordial axis of symmetry. He also stated that later in development both regular and irre- gular echinoids become radially symmetrical, the regular echinoids remaining so and the irregular echinoids becoming secondarily bilaterally symmetrical. This new axis of bi- lateral symmetry (Loven's axis) does not coincide with the primordial axis of symmetry. Gordon (I928), working along similar lines to Ubisch, agrees in general with his findings, making particular mention of the importance of the II, 4 axis of bilateral symmetry in the imagines of both regular and irregular echinoids; but unlike Ubisch she qualifies her statement on the radial symmetry of these forms. "In spite of its shape, the test of the imago of a regular urchin is almost 1 Dr. H. L. Clarke has told the author that he saw a specimen of Lovenia elongata at Broome, West Australia, travel on the sandy shore towards the receding tide at the rate of I.5 feet per minute.</page><page sequence="22">108 RODERICK MACDONALD bilaterally symmetrical about the primordial plane of sym- metry. This is more pronounced in the imago of a primitive form like Arbacia than in that of Echinus or Strongylocen- trotus . ... As the young urchin increases in size, the bilateral symmetry becomes less and less apparent, although still present, and the adult seems to be radially symmetrical" (p. 314). "Strictly speaking, a regular sea-urchin is neither radially nor bilaterally symmetrical. The skeletal anatomy is most nearly symmetrical about the primordial plane. Loven's Law, though not always strictly adhered to (especially as regards arrangement of interambulacral plates), is impor- tant" (p. 315). As already remarked, Loven has shown that the size and arrangement of the primordial ambulacral plates adhere to Loven's axis. He also maintained that the interambulacral plates at the base of the corona adhere to this axis. This latter statement, as pointed out by Jackson, though often true is frequently not true. However, it would appear that there is a striking tendency to dominance of Lov'en's axis at this stage of development. During the development of the corona, not only the ambulacral plates but also the inter- ambulacral plates originate in direct contact with the ocular plates, and it would appear that during further growth of the skeleton of regular sea urchins the interambulacra, which Jackson (page 62) says function chiefly as space fillers, are influenced in their growth and development by the ambulacral plates. In this connection, Deutler (I926) says: "Man hat den Eindruck dass diese Ambulacralplatten sind, welche das eigenartige Wachstum der Schale bestimmen, dass das Wachstum der Interambulacral sich nach den von den Ambulacralplatten geschaffenen Verhaltnissen richtet, also ein Regulations wachstum ist. Dass das Wachstum der Ambulacralplatten iuber das der Interambulacralplatten ent- scheidet, halten wir deshalb fur wahrscheinlich, weil es praktisch ist, dass zuerst die Ambulacralplatten maximal wachsen, und dass diese dann, nachdem sie ihre maximale Gr6sse in der Schale erreicht haben, bis zum Peristomrand</page><page sequence="23">STUDY OF SYMMETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 109 m6glichst breit bleiben; denn dadurch wird sehr friih fur die Fiusschen kanale Platz geschafft, dadurch werden die beiden Fiusschenreihen des Ambulacrums auseinander geschoben, und dadurch bleiben diese selbst noch am Peristomrand in zeimlich weiter Entfernung von einander. Das wachsende Ambulacralgefassystem k6nnte den Anstoss zu dem eigen- artigen Wachstum der Schalenplatten geben. Den Beweis dafiir miissen wir allerdings schuldig bleiben" (p. I53). The fact that during growth the structure of the corona is constantly subject to change is commented on by Loven (I892) as follows: "In all Echinoidea the growth of the corona is effected by new plates being successively added at the aboral termination of the ambulacra and interradia and by their increasing in size and solidity. As long as the animal lives, there is at work, more or less, in every part of its frame a continuous movement of reabsorption and renewal, of taking on one form and losing it for another . . . and this process is perhaps nowhere more conspicuous than in the corona of the Cidaridoe and Echinidoe." Further evidence of the plasticity of the skeleton, at least in the early adult life of the individual in regular sea urchins is shown by Jackson's findings on the migration of the ocular plates to the border of the periproct. The sequence with which these plates migrate adheres to Loven's axis. It is true that the water vascular system and the internal anatomy generally of sea urchins are not bilaterally symmetrical, but it is worthy of note that the madreporite lies almost midway between the primordial and Loven's planes of symmetry. The position of the madreporite may be the result of the relative effectiveness of the dominance of an inherent bilateral symmetry of the animal and that of the organization of the internal organs, more particularly the water vascular system on the plastic skeleton. With regard to the corona, the manifestation of bilateral symmetry is inhibited by the water vascular system, which as Deutler suggests, imposes its or- ganization on the constantly changing form, and consequent impressionability of the corona.</page><page sequence="24">110 RODERICK MACDONALD The tendency for Loven's axis to dominate the organ- ization of the regular sea urchins is supported by our observa- tions in the case of Lytechinus, where the locomotor axis coincides with Loven's axis. We have also made observations on the movements of Eucidaris tribuloides, Tripneustes es- culentus, Arbacia punctulata, Echinometra lacunter, and Strongylocentrotus dr6bachiensis. The first three are primitive forms and show no evidence of a functional axis of bilateral symmetry. Echinometra is elliptical through the I, 3 axis, but from observations on its walking and righting movements, it is definitely functionally bilaterally symmetrical about Loven's axis. This is remarkable, considering the shape of the animal, and indicates how very dominant, functionally, is Loven's axis in this highly specialized sea urchin. Investi- gations on the movements of Strongylocentrotus, at present in progress, indicate that the functional axis may be Loven's axis or the primordial axis. More observations are necessary before it can be said which, if any, of these axes is adhered to most commonly. Still it does appear that Strongylocentrotus is in its walking and righting movements bilaterally symmetri- cal about these two important axes. While writing this account of observations on the above sea urchins, the author came across a paper written by Kat- suzo Onoda (1933). Onoda noticed while examining the denuded tests of Heliocidaris crassispina that the tubercles of nearly one half of the hemisphere of the test were consider- ably smaller than those of the other half, and that in unde- nuded specimens the spines of nearly one half of the hemi- sphere were very much shorter and thinner than those of the other half. In Clark's (I925) description of this sea urchin, he states that the spines are slender despite the name. Onoda's observations apparently account for the discrepancy indicated by the name crassispina and Clark's description. This sea urchin is highly specialized, comparable in this re- spect to Echinometra. Onoda concludes as follows: "Thus it is clear that there is a rather definite physiological differen- tiation in the ambitus of this regular sea-urchin . . . it is</page><page sequence="25">STUDY OF SYMMETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 111 of some interest that the physiological antero-posterior axis of the present species coincides exactly with that in Spatan- goids." It is of special interest to note that Onoda found that during locomotion the A-end of the A axis (i.e. the region with small spines) was consistently directed forward, directional movement thus strictly coinciding with what we find in the Spatangoids. CONCLUSION The evidence so far brought forward seems to show that a bilaterally symmetrical organization is the inheritance of all the members of the Echinoidea. This may be expressed both structurally and functionally. The structural expression is portrayed in the sea urchin during development; the variation in this portrayal, namely a different axis of bilateral symmetry in each of the following stages-the free swimming larva, the imago, and the adult-is inherent in the animal and would appear to be in its genesis independent of the external environ- ment. The functional expression, on the other hand, is in its manifestation to a great extent dependent on the external environment, together with the needs of the animal as a whole. Granted that the conditions are favorable to functional ex- pression, this may become explicit, as it does in Lytechinus, and gradually conform to the form of structural expression already dominant. As a result of this coincidence in struc- tural and functional -expression, these tend to become more marked until we reach a stage such as is found in some of the highly specialized irregular Echinoidea, where there is a well defined circumscribed coincident structural and functional axis of bilateral symmetry. There is no evidence that the functional and structural expressions of the organization of sea urchins are exclusively depecndent on each other for their manifestation. The point that we wish to make is that in the one case, structural expression, the internal environment is sufficient to make possible the release and limning of that expression; whereas the functional expression requires in addition the external environment for its manifestation.</page><page sequence="26">112 RODERICK MACDONALD DISCUSSION The following discussion is written in non-orthodox biological language. The reason for so doing arises from the awareness on the part of the writer that the currently used elementalistic language does not correspond in structure to the observed structure of happenings in nature. Here I accept the linguistic and semantic revision of Count Alfred Korzyb- ski, as formulated in his book Science and Sanity, an Intro- duction to Non-A!ristotelian Systems and General Semantics, and will make use of some of his terminology, such as "order," and "non-elementalism," which is a broader conception than "organism-as-a-whole," as it includes by implication the environment, which "organism-as-a-whole" does not. Ele- mentalism in this new sense represents a description of "facts" (objects, functions, relations, etc.) as though the described "elements" or verbal aspects had an independent "reality" in actual life. In addition, elementalism represents a de- scription of objects, functions, relations, etc. as though such issues could be actually isolated. This verbal detachment of linguistic "elements" is artificial. When so described, the object or organism and its functions, etc. become empirically non-existent. These considerations become increasingly im- portant to biologists who realize the confusion brought about by artificial linguistic splittings and linguistic self-deceptions. Originally biological observations were expressed in an- thropomorphic language, and later, through the work of Loeb (1907) and others, this language was replaced by a non-elementalistic language which in its structure cor- responded to the observed happenings in nature. This work was of course preliminary and Loeb's followers, although they have worked along similar lines, do not develop in their writings Loeb's important implications, namely that the activities of all living things not only can be expressed in a language equally applicable to sciences other than biology (namely, mathematics, mathematical physics, etc.), but also that the use of such a language is the only way that we can today adequately express the non-elementalistic activities of the organism-as-a-whole. Loeb emphasized the organism-</page><page sequence="27">STUDY OF SYMMETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 113 as-a-whole and to a certain extent applied this new emphasis, and as a partial result the new implications suggested new experiments. One type of reaction was described as "tro- pism" and another as "Unterschiedsempfindlichkeit" (dif- ferential response). These types of reaction, according to Loeb, differ from each other as do the quantities of the dimension of an acceleration from those of a dimension of a velocity. In other words, these two types of reactions belong to different levels. The analogy is not strictly true, because in both velocity and acceleration the time factor is present in different forms, whereas in the two types of reactions pointed out by Loeb the time factor emerges in only one. The first type, namely tropism, belongs to the first level, expressed f (i). In the second type, Unterschiedsempfindlichkeit (dif- ferential response), which belongs to a second or higher level, di a factor emerges-time, and this is expressed f.dt Hargitt and Jennings argue that the reaction of type fditdiffering as it does fromf (i) contradicts the existence of the latter type. As pointed out by Loeb, this is no more the case than the existence of accelerations contradicts the existence of veloc- ities. The validity of this statement becomes more ap- parent when we use the non-elementalistic term order. The two types of reaction are of different levels. They express different orders of abstractions. Irritability is a dynamic structural characteristic of all protoplasm so far observed. Some reactions on the part of the organism, correlated as they are with the latter's irritability to envirogenic influences, belong either to onel evel-f (i), or to another levelfdt. The identification of these orders, or perhaps the non-recognition that the reactions under consideration belong to two levels or orders of abstractions no doubt led to the semantic I confusion of Hargitt and Jennings. I General Semantics is that science which studies the linguistic psycho-biological reactions of human being. In biology the linguistic reaction of the biologist to the activities of the organism must be considered, producing an adequate formulation of what is taking place.</page><page sequence="28">114 RODERICK MACDONALD In a recent publication, Foxon (1934) points out the un- satisfactory explanations of tropisms put forward until now, such as Loeb's mechanical hypothesis and Russell's (1934) interpretation of what we see as a "flight response," diffi- cult to reconcile with Clarke's important work on Daphnia (1932). Observations of phototaxis in Porcellana larvae made by Spooner (I933) and Foxon (I934) show that this animal moves forward or backward towards the source of light. Foxon has shown that if a Porcellana larva is swim- ming head forward (i.e. normally) toward the source of light and then the light is suddenly moved so that it shines from behind the animals, the larva, instead of reorienting itself to the new source of light, reverses its locomotory mechanism, i.e. swims backwards. He also states that "this failure to reorientate is correlated with the possession of the very long spines characteristic of these larvae for when these spines are cut off, the larvae, on reversal of the direction of the stimulus, reorientate immediately." Whereas Loeb's description of what happens is partial and necessarily superficial, based as it is on the visible "machine- like" actions of the organism, Russell's descriptions are anthropomorphic. We agree with Foxon with regard to the inadequacy of Russell's interpretation and should like to draw attention here to the tendency on the part of this author to make anthropomorphic descriptions of the behavior of animals. While describing the reactions of an amoeba to stimuli, Russell says: "It is clear also from a consideration of the whole behavior that it is not the stimulus per se that is reacted to but its significance," The Study of Living Things, 1924 (page 74). Again, "The common element in these stimuli as perceived is their significance as indicative of food" (page 77). Here Russell gives to the amceba a standard of evaluation which is that of a human being. The amceba's behavior is based on unrestricted identification. The amoeba reacts to a fine needle vibrating close to it in a way similar to that in which it reacts to a moving food organism. The amceba thus identifies the sign with food. Here evaluation is</page><page sequence="29">STUDY OF SYMMETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 115 on a pre-human level. An organism which reacts to the significance of an event has standards of evaluation of a high order and completely eliminates identification in its nervous reactions. Such an organism would be a human being be- having as such. To say, as Russell does, that the significance of stimuli is perceived by the amoeba or that the amoeba reacts to the significance of a stimulus is anthropomorphic and a false description of what is observed. Foxon concludes that these movements on the part of Porcellana larva are not mechanically produced, as Loeb's theory holds, but that there is some nervous integration going on which determines the manner in which the response is to be produced. It would appear, in the light of Foxon's significant obser- vations, that the stimulus-light-brings about a dynamic disturbance in the nervous system on the colloidal levels, tending to reorient the dynamic colloido-quantum structure of these cells or their colloido-quantum configurations. This reorientation, however, is obstructed in its visible expression, namely the movement of the animal, as a result of the me- chanics of body structure (presence of very long spines, etc.), and results in a reversal of polarity of the dynamic structure of the nervous system and consequent reversal of movement of the animal. When the obstructing mechanics of macro- scopic body structure is removed, the reorientation of the dynamic colloido-quantum structure of the nervous system, thus unhindered, expresses itself in the macroscopic reorienta- tion of the body of the animal as-a-whole. This is offered not as an explanation, but as a linguistic expression struc- turally corresponding to what is observed. The organism-as-a-whole approach to the study of living things has in its application led Child (I928) to use the term "dynamic or physiological gradients." He pointed out that many of the most important characteristics of living proto- plasm are strictly bound up with structural integrity. He also showed that the trafficking between the internal environ- ment and the external environment is dynamically structural</page><page sequence="30">116 RODERICK MACDONALD and supplies the energies which activate the organism. Child emphasized the necessary functional inter-relationship of the organism-as-a-whole (non-elementalism, in the Korzybski sense) with the environment, and presented a biological system which could be and was expressed by him in struc- turally corresponding non-elementalistic terms. Child's experimental evidence of metabolic gradients has been variously criticized, notably by Parker (I929). As a result of his experiments on flat worms and sea anemones, he found that they "possess a metabolism that in its distribution throughout their bodies is extremely uniform." Yet he states that "This uniformity is replaced by a quantitative diversity only in those animals such as the annelids, the arthropods, the molluscs, and the vertebrates, whose bodies are highly differentiated." Parker does not deny the pres- ence of metabolic gradients, but states that "if present they are not factors in morphogenesis but are at best measures of activity which may serve as features in the description of organisms." In replying to Parker's criticism Child I points out that the criticized theory does not demand a rectilineal (" longi- tudinal") gradient in the adult of every species and states that "Actually, however, the gradient hypothesis has never implied a fixed metabolic diversity in adult animals." To the present writer, the importance of Child's work rests not so much on the detailed conclusiveness of his results as on the suggestiveness of his methods in seeking to deal with a possible "measure of activity in the description of organ- isms" and on his attempt to describe his observations in a language whose structure corresponds to the happenings in the organism as observed by him. The present-day known colloido-quantum complexities of the organism, and the linguistic difficulties of an organism-as- a-whole treatment, show the great need not only for collecting experimental data of all kinds but also for the production of I Watanabe, Yisamu and Child, C. M., "The Longitudinal Gradient in Stylochus Ijimai; with a Critical Discussion." Physiological Zoology, Vol. VI, No. 4, 1933.</page><page sequence="31">STUDY OF SYMMETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 117 new theories of new structure which would more adequately cover the facts. When biologists acquire the permanent consciousness that they deal exclusively with absolute indi- viduals and that all that is said of an organism which implies a denial of this is verbal fiction, a great many theoretical difficulties will automatically disappear. (See Science and Sanity.) Owing to the preliminary nature of these remarks, we cannot elaborate this point at present. Recent attempts by E. S. Russell (I924 and I934) to use the organism-as-a-whole treatment in describing the activities of organisms introduce new anthropomorphic tendencies by dragging in "meaning" where in animal life there is no " meaning" (although the automatic physico-chemical reaction has survival value), and make it obvious that biology needs a complete linguistic reformulation. The following discussion has a broader scope, as it offers a preliminary attempt to utilize a neutral non-elementalistic language which would be applicable to inanimate and animate nature, including man. Since the most recent research in general semantics, physico- mathematical sciences, and the work of Courtis 1 allow the application of mathematical and physico-mathematical methods to all processes this becomes feasible. The necessary linguistic revision of biology is bound to be very radical, because we cannot any longer preach the organism-as-a-whole and express those issues in the old elementalistic language. The meaning of the organism-as-a-whole will also have to be enlarged to non-elementalism, which applies equally to physics and biology. The revolutionary achievement of Einstein-Minkowski was the production of a new non-ele- mentalistic language of space-time, similar in structure to the observed facts of nature. A similar revolution must be I "Elsewhere the writer has shown (Courtis, S. A., "Maturation Units for the Measuring of Growth," School and Society, XXX, 1929) that for all biologic growth in which individual differences increase with age, so long as conditions remain constant (deterministic growth), the increases in the loglogs of the percentages of maturity are directly proportional to the increases in time.

Investigations expressed in the old language of old structure conceal instead of suggest. Any language or any system must depend ultimately on un- defined terms. The term order, with its derivatives, repre- sents not only a non-elementalistic term but one of the most fundamental terms on which mathematics, mathematical physics, etc., and our new revision, must be based. The problem considered in these investigations is es- sentially one of "organization" or "orderliness." According- ly a preliminary consideration of orderliness in the living animal is pertinent. The essential properties of protoplasm are due ultimately to its colloidal nature, and its energetic (dynamic) con- comitants. When we consider this more in detail, it may be said to be made up of units of various levels of complexity. The electrons etc. belong to the primary level, the atoms, ions, etc. to the secondary level, and the molecules to the third level. Microscopically visible particles which result from the union of colloidal particles dependent on the above three levels give rise to various orders of increasing complexities. These colloidal units are all electrically charged, either positively or negatively, and make possible the dynamic interplays found in all living protoplasm. These dynamic centers and poles follow the same laws as those which regulate electro-magnetic poles. There are two kinds of poles, posi- tive and negative. Here we have the first microscopic or macroscopic (cloud formation) levels of orderliness-a bi- polarity orderliness. This makes possible regular diffusion currents between the poles, which are connected with the origins of cellular tissues. According to the findings of biophysicists (W. Seifriz, I928), the structure of living matter is fibrous; it is made up of an interlacing mass of amino acid chains or slender crystalline "fibers." Here, then, we have on a higher level, cellular level, another level of orderliness.</page><page sequence="33">STUDY OF SYMMETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 119 On a still higher level, organ level, we have in at least the less highly integrated animals a unibilateral symmetry orderliness. Finally, this latter level of orderliness is characteristic of the body structure of the majority of living things. There is still another level of orderliness which is seen in the ovum of many animals and also in the coelenterates, ctenophores, and some echinoderms. This is multibilateral symmetry orderliness. In response to sperm penetration (the sperm is unibilaterally symmetrical), or in response to a suitable stimulus, such as a chemical change in the environ- ment or the mechanical prick of a needle, we have a modifica- tion of the internal reaction system, involving a new dynamic arrangement of parts and a reintegration of the factors which produce the individual. In other words, we have a change from the more complex multibilateral symmetry orderliness of the ovum, to a more restricted pattern correlated with the less complex bilateral symmetry orderliness which charac- terizes the zygote. It will be seen that all these levels of orderliness though different in complexity are fundamentally similar, their orientation being axial. Some investigators speak of a "unifying principle" as though it explained this semantic or leveling orderliness. What are the conditions which make possible this visible co6rdination (ordering) of events at various levels in development-that is our quest. At various levels we see different conditions but always orderly co6r- dination. Each level gives rise to a succeeding level as a result of the emergence of a complexity of conditions of a higher order. Each level is characterized by its complexity of conditions and a correlated difference in complexity or dimensionality of orderliness. We are far from being in a position to inquire into the details of the mechanism of order- liness. Fundamentally this description is in agreement with Koffka (1924), who says concerning his view: "To many this view of the constitution of the most primitive phenomena will appear very odd indeed, for it assumes that a certain order dominates experience from the beginning. Whereas</page><page sequence="34">120 RODERICK MACDONALD we would be in much better agreement with current views if we were to assume that order comes only as a result of experi- ence" (page 130). It appears, then, that the use of terms-order and levels and their derivatives-in the analysis of the most complex biological phenomena unifies our efforts because mathematics and mathematical physics are based to a large extent on the term order, with well-known constructive results. Thus perhaps the application of such terms to biology, etc. may bring about constructive results where chaos prevailed. With this brief approach, let us consider the problem in hand: Sea urchins found living on rocks have more powerful tube feet than those found on sand. The radially symmetrical arrangement of tube feet on the corona enables the sea urchin living on rocks to withstand dislodgement. It can cling on to the rock with its tube feet by almost all parts of its superficies. Those urchins found on the rocks generally move in almost any direction. Their behavior is multianial. In the case of those sea urchins which live on the sand, the tube feet have ceased to be the most efficient organs for relatively rapid locomotion and correlated with this we find: (i) other organs of locomotion are more commonly used, namely the spines; (2) the tube feet are less robust and tend to be used as tactile organs, "feelers," rather than as organs of locomotion; (3) the behavior of locomotion tends to be restricted, the animal moving in progressively fewer directions. The adult sea urchin as a whole, functional-structural, is the expression of a balance between inherited phylogenetic characters and in- herited ontogenetic characters, which makes possible the survival of the animal. There are here two orders of inheri- tance; the former is a more primitive form, and of more ancient heritage, and therefore is more deeply ingrained in the whole body of the animal than is the latter-this order of inheritance may be considered to be closely associated with a lower level of integration, such as the submicroscopic or colloidal level; the latter is more intimately bound up with the macroscopic environment, both internal and external, of the animal, and in this sense is on a higher level of integration.</page><page sequence="35">STUDY OF SYMMETRY IN CENTRECHINOIDEA 121 The adult Arbacia may be considered as being a sea urchin in which not only structure but function (locomotion) has changed from the first order to the second order. In other words, behavior as well as structure has become what may be called multibilateral.1 In the adult Lytechinus we find a partial arrest of func- tional symmetry, the more primitive uni-bilateral symmetry being maintained, whereas structure for the most part has -become multi-bilaterally symmetrical. In the irregular sea urchins we find a complete arrest of functional uni-bilateral symmetry, together with an increasing arrest of structural uni-bilateral symmetry. Three stages in this gradual increas- ing arrest in structural uni-bilateral symmetry are seen in Echinocardium cordatum, Lovenia elongata, and finally in such forms as those found in the family Pourtalesiidce, respectively. In adult Echinoidea, we find a series of changes from the condition found in Arbacia, which is structurally-functionally multi-bilaterally symmetrical, movement being multidirec- tional, to such forms as Echinocardium cordatum and Echi- narachnius parma, which are structurally-functionally uni- bilaterally symmetrical, and where movement is unidirec- tional. The latter condition, structurally-functionally, is exactly what we find in the free-swimming larval echinoderm. In other words, we see in the Echinoidea evidence of a regres- sion of functional-structural ordinality. On the other hand, if by evolution we mean increasing specialization, then the Echinoidea may be considered as demonstrating a well-marked evolutionary series. The im- portant point to notice is that there can be two interpretations of the observed "facts," which interpretations are not con- tradictory but intimately connected. They must be con- sidered as such if we would have, ultimately, some more understanding of the sub-microscopic structure-function of any individual sea urchin. It is thus exhibited more completely than heretofore that 1 There is no fundamental difference between uni-bilateral symmetry and radial symmetry. The latter, which may be called multibilateral symmetry, is seen to be merely a different order of bilateral symmetry.</page><page sequence="36">122 RODERICK MACDONALD multibilateral symmetry of structure-function, in post-ovum development, is not primitive in the Echinoidea, but is a secondary development and ultimately tends to be replaced in their phylogeny by a primitive order of symmetry-a unibilateral symmetry. SUMMARY Experimental evidence acquired by the author indicates that Lytechinus variegatus, Echinometra lacunter, Strongylo- centrotus drobachiensis are functionally bilaterally sym- metrical. This evidence, together with observations made by various other investigators, shows that a bilaterally symmetri- cal organization (structure-function) is the inheritance of all the members of the Echinoidea. The discussion draws attention to the fact that the struc- ture of the language commonly used to describe biological phenomena does not correspond to the organism-as-a-whole, and non-elementalistic treatment of such phenomena, and therefore has not adequately described the observations of investigators nor their conclusions therefrom. A preliminary attempt has been made to overcome these linguistic difficulties by the use of the term order and its derivatives. There are different levels of orderliness in the dynamic structure- function of an organism which, though differing in complexity of conditions, are fundamentally similar. Confusion of these levels, or failure to recognize them, results in linguistically fictitious descriptions of happenings in nature. It is more completely demonstrated that multi-bilateral symmetry of structure-function in post-ovum development is not primitive in the Echinoidea but is a secondary develop- ment, and ultimately tends to be replaced in their phylogeny by a primitive order of symmetry-a unibilateral symmetry. * * * Acknowledgment is very gratefully made to Mr. Robert A.
