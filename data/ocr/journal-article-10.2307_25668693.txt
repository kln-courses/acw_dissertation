Parsons ABSTRACT Study of two Texas rock art sites reveals that they can be interpreted, at least in part, by comparison with conventions and ideographs of known meaning found on portable art of the Plains Indians. One site, Mujares Creek, is tentatively linked to specific historic events, and a date for its execution is thus derived. Function of the rock art sites as coup recounting stations is suggested. This function implies repeated use of such sites, and suggests proximity of the rock art sites to frequently visited trails or campsites. INTRODUCTION This paper presents the results of a study of two historic Indian rock art sites in the Panhandle-Plains region of Texas. These sites have been found to contain symbols which are recognizable as ideographs often seen in the pictographic art found on many portable artifacts of the Plains Indians. Cer tain compositions observed at the rock art sites, as well as conventions employed by the artists, have also been found to be very simi lar to those on the portable art objects. In the case of portable art, we have, in many cases, records of the artists' own interpretations of the symbol systems they employed. This allows us to apply these known meanings to rock art compositions which have heretofore been "unreadable", and to suggest that the functions of the rock art sites are, at least in part, analogous to functions of the portable art. This congruence of function between portable art and the consummately unporta ble rock art is striking, and implies a form of ritual activity in which rock art sites were created and probably revisited as a part of coup recounting ceremonies. Keyser (1977, 1979, 1987) has used similar techniques to reach virtually identical conclusions about rock art sites in the northwestern Plains. The close parallels between the results of the two studies, which were independently con ducted, provides gratifying confirmation of the applicability of this technique to the study of historic rock art sites up and down the Great Plains. PLAINS INDIAN PICTORIAL ART Plains Indian portable pictorial art (here after shortened to PIPPA for the sake of con venience) is a term chosen for use in this paper because it excludes non-portable art of the Plains Indians (i.e. rock art) and the many Plains Indian art forms which do not include pictographic images. PIPPA is defined herein as a body of representational art produced by the Plains Indians of North America in historic times and evidenced by hundreds of speci mens of painted robes, hides, shirts, tipis, shields, ledgers, and other miscellaneous objects in museums and collections around the world. The Plains Indian phenomenon, the equestrian-bison hunting culture, was remarkably uniform considering its extensive geographical range, limited temporal span, and diverse cultural origins of its participants (Newcomb 1961:98-99). PIPPA, as a part of that culture, partakes of this uniformity. Thus the style of depicting things, as well as the choice of subject matter, was remarkably similar from the northwest plains of Canada to the south plains of Texas. Keyser (1987) has admirably treated the characteristics and 257</page><page sequence="2">evolution of that style, especially as it is manifest in the northwest plains, and I will not attempt to repeat his work here; however, I will offer some broad generalizations which will be useful in considering PIPPA and comparing it with Plains Indian rock art. First, PIPPA is heavily influenced by the concept of counting coup (Lowie 1954:134; Keyser 1987:44). Probably a clear majority of PIPPA is devoted to recording and displaying the exploits of warriors. A man's status in Plains society depended largely upon achievements in war, horse stealing, and hunting. He made sure that his position was well known by singing and telling of his ex ploits at social and ceremonial gatherings, wearing special ornaments which advertised them, and painting them on his clothes, his horse, his house, and almost anything else. These exploit drawings often took the form of detailed pictures of the deed, and many times details were included which revealed his status, society membership, or special roles he might have played. If a lack of space imposed limits, however, the information may have been conventionalized. A gun firing came to represent the enemy, or a horse track stood for the horse (Lowie 1954:108-109). A second theme important in PIPPA is history. Battles were sometimes shown on robes or tipi covers (Barbeau 1960:Fig. 23), but these seemed, usually, to be ways of recording the coups counted during the fight, and some which might be interpreted as bat tle scenes may actually have depicted various exploits of a particular warrior over a period of several years (Lowie 1954:110). Of more historical interest, perhaps, are the winter counts, or calendars. These were hides upon which symbols were painted representing an important event of each year (Mooney 1898; Praus 1962; Barbeau 1960:Fig. 23). This practice called for a set of simple signs, or ideographs, to serve as reminders to the count keeper of what happened in a certain year. The results were a very efficient short hand method of drawing pictures of events. Another place where ideographs were often used was in name glyphs. In the autobiographical exploit drawings, the warrior sometimes identified himself by a name glyph, similar to the one seen in Figure 5 for Sitting Bull. On the reservation, at govern ment request, censuses were made using name glyphs and these are treasures in ideography (Mallery 1893:448-458). One other theme in PIPPA is the depiction of personal medicine, or dreams. An individ ual's personal dream might have been painted on his shield or his tipi (Lowie 1954:77). This motive seems to account for only a small portion of PIPPA. THE ROCK ART SITES Mujares Creek Mujares Creek (Fig. 2, 3) is a very impor tant Plains Indian rock art site, located on a southern tributary of the Canadian River, in Oldham County, Texas (Fig. 1). It is one of several Plains Indian rock art sites recorded in the area by Kirkland (Newcomb 1967: 208-209). It is a petroglyph site; all of the designs having been carved or scratched into a sandstone cliff. Nearly all the elements at Mujares Creek can be identified as historic, either directly or by association with historic components. One of the more frequent subjects at Mujares Creek is a quadrupedal animal with an elongated rectangular body and long lyre shaped horns. Several of these have been "shaded" by smoothing the surface within the outlined area (Fig. 2 and 3). This technique Fig. 1. Map of Texas showing county locations of sites: A, Mujares Creek; B. Verbena. 258</page><page sequence="3">No.2 No.3 No.4 No.S \ No 6 A fJo 7 L_/_No. I &lt;V \ 1 No.9 No.10 No.II No 12 No. 13 I-1 No 8 j 1 | Fig. 2. Mujares Creek petroglyphs (after a watercolor by Forrest Kirkland in Newcomb 1967:209). is rare in rock art, but it has also been noted in Kansas (O'Neill 1981:5). It resembles the technique in PIPPA of outlining the figure in a dark hue and coloring in the interior. Newcomb (1967:208) suggests that these animals are longhorn cattle and states that "if this is the case the petroglyphs probably date to post-civil War days when cattle were first brought into this region". Ewers (1976:67) concurs with Newcomb's identification but notes that as early as 1805 a Crow Indian in Montana was using the tail of a Spanish cow as part of his war medicine. Berlandier also collected, in 1828 among the Comanche, a shield which bore the tail of a cow "pendant in the center of its buckskin cover" (Ewers 1976:68). It should also be noted that begin ning in 1829, oxen, many of which were "range cattle from Texas . . . having horns of. . . immense size ..." (Walker 1966:107), began to be used on the Santa Fe Trail which passed through the immediate vicinity of Mujares Creek. Thus, it is likely that the Indians of the Mujares Creek area had seen long-horned European cattle in the area by the 1830's, and that they may have observed them at a considerably earlier date in Mexico, New Mexico, or southern Texas. Another animal commonly depicted at Mujares Creek is the horse. More than a dozen are shown not counting horses defi nitely in association with human figures, which will be considered separately below. These horses share several characteristics with the cattle: they face toward the left of the panel, in accord with the usual PIPPA pattern (O'Brien 1973:11); some are shaded in the manner described above; and most stand 259</page><page sequence="4">alone as compositions, it not being apparent that they are the object of actions by any of the human figures shown. These two classes of animals, cattle and horses without riders or others definitely associated with human figures, probably rep resent animals stolen from Euroamericans or from other Indian groups. Stealing horses, of course, was one of the chief means by which a Plains Indian warrior could achieve distinc tion or status. In most tribes it was second on ly to counting coup by striking an enemy or snatching his weapon (Lowie 1954:108; Mishkin 1940:3). Many Plains Indian pictorial art objects depict incidents in which the hero, usually the artist, is shown stealing horses. These range from detailed drawings showing the mounted warrior driving horses or mules (Stirling 1938:various pages; Fig 7, this paper; Ewers 1968:Fig. J; Ewers 1939:PI. 18, 20) to highly conventionalized or abbreviated ver sions of the same theme, as on a painted buffalo hide from the U.S. National Museum (Feder 1965:17), upon which the idea is expressed by simply drawing quirts in con junction with horse tracks. Human beings are depicted at Mujares Creek in four principal contexts. One figure (Fig. 2, lower right) is shown leading or grasping a horse by the bridle. Five others are shown mounted but with no object of the action portrayed. These may all be variations on the theme of horse stealing. In seven cases pairs of human figures are depicted. One composition shows a mounted figure striking a hatted pedestrian, probably a Euroamerican. This is a very common motif in PIPPA, and represents a warrior killing or counting coup against an enemy (Figs. 5-7, 9). Most of the other paired human figures probably also represent a protagonist warrior and his victim, though the action of striking is not as clearly shown. Note the passive or supplicating posture of the left-hand figure in most of these cases. The movement of action to the left is consistent with patterns in Plains Indian pictorial art (O'Brien 1973:11; LaMont 1975:77-78) and vanquished warriors often r s ?_*Wfc\ '' \ ?1 \ I \ \ I_i-?-?^?^?-?-J Fig. 3.

A few other human figures at Mujares Creek remain to be discussed. These are frontally posed, in contrast with human figures in most pre-reservation Plains Indian pictorial art. One of these (Fig. 2, center right) has a chevron-shaped design on its chest which Newcomb has probably correctly identified as hairpipe breastplates like those often worn by Plains warriors (Newcomb 1967:212). One other of these frontally posed figures (Fig. 3, right of center) is of particular interest. Though stylistically dissimilar to most human figures at Mujares Creek, it is linked to the other art there by the technique of smoothing within the outlines of the figure, and is probably by the same artists. If it could be ascertained that the arrow and the figure were in correct propor tion, it would be tempting to call attention to the similarity between the figure and Bod mer's portrayal of a leader of the Mandan Buffalo Bull Society with his arrow-lance (Thomas and Ronnefeldt 1976:217). Given the Plains artist's propensity to ignore propor tion, however, it would probably be unwise to make any claim for such an interpretation. An especially interesting class of subjects at Mujares Creek is that of weapons. Five flintlock rifles, so identified by Newcomb (1967:208) because of their conspicuous frizzens, are seen. Two are isolated (Fig. 3, far and lower right), but one group of three (Fig. 2, No. 13) occurs. Of more interest is the skillfully rendered group of weapons in upper Figure 3. This panel, approximately four feet in length and two and one half feet high, is carved in a place on the cliff over ten feet above the ground. Newcomb (1967:208) identifies the components of this composition as "three bows, thirteen arrows, three war clubs, and one gun". In addition, there are two unidentified, bundle-like objects at the upper right of the panel. Newcomb (1967:208) notes that the rifle, unlike those mentioned above, appears to be of the percussion type, which would date the panel as post-1820. The arrows are all shown feathered on one side of the shaft only, perhaps to economize on space in the somewhat crowded composition. Eleven arrow points are shown as solid, but gaps shown in the basal halves of two may represent notches or binding. Of particular interest are the two right-most of the three "bows". These are clearly drawn, and the main body of the weapon conforms exactly to simple bows widely seen in PIPPA. These two specimens, however, are provided with points, similar to the arrow points discussed in the previous paragraph but with two narrow horizontal gaps in the basal areas. An accidental encounter with a drawing of a bow-lance in a "Pictographic Dictionary" published by Petersen (1971:308) prompted a hasty search of the literature of Plains Indian weaponry and regalia. Several sources were found in which Indian or European artists depicted bow-lances. Wissler (1916:71) illustrates a Sioux bow-lance with a point similar to the Mujares Creek examples (Fig. 4). In 1833 Bodmer painted an Assiniboine warrior carrying a bow-lance with three slots on each side of the tip (Thomas and Ronne feldt 1976:67). He also painted an arrow-lance with a similar point (Thomas and Ronnefeldt 1976:217). Bad Heart Bull (Blish 1967, nu merous paintings) shows bow-lances being carried into war by the Sioux, both against the Crows and at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. He also depicts them as parts of the regalia of the Tokala Society of the Sioux and in the Race of the Sacred Bows (Blish 1967:114, 184). Sitting Bull's adopted son, Jumping Bull, is shown carryng the bow-lance in several horse-stealing and coup-counting exploits (Stirling 1938; see Figs. 6 and 7). An examination of the ethnographic liter ature reveals that the bow-lance was used as an important part of the regalia of certain warrior societies in the central and northern plains area. The lances ranged in length from five to eight feet and were tipped in early times with flint (Mails 1973:330) or bone (Blish 1967:66), and later by metal points (Mails 1973:164, 330; Grinnell 1923:84). The bow lance was usually heavily ornamented with paint, beads, feathers, and wrappings of skin. It was apparently used only as a lance, despite Mails' speculations that the lance might be "planted" and used as a bow while embedded (many Plains warrior societies had leaders who customarily staked themselves to the ground with their lances during battle and remained in place until rescued by their fellows). Among the Ogalala Sioux the bow-lance 261</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 4. Bow-lance of the Sotka Tanka society of the Oglala Dakota (after Wissler 1912:71). became sacred to the whole group, and they observed important rites called the Race of the Sacred Bows. In this ceremony the sacred lodge and sweat lodge of the Sacred Bow Cult were erected at the center of the camp, and poles were set up at the edge of camp, one at each of the four directions. Four racers, each carrying a bow-lance, left the center and ran to the west, where they counted coup on the pole and returned to the center lodges, each pole being thus visited in the course of the race (Mails 1973:264-266; Blish 1967: 184). Grinnell (1923, vol. 2:79-86) has given a detailed and informative account of the use of the bow-lance by the Contraries of the Cheyenne. The ritual weapon was the prin cipal item of regalia of this group. Its power, connected with thunder and lightning, was immense, and an elaborate system of rules and proscriptions controlled its use. The Cheyenne bow-lance was about five feet in length and was provided with two strings. It was wrapped and decorated with very specific items, including bird skins, feathers, and bear intestines. A notched or barbed metal point was often made from the bottom of a frying pan (Grinnell 1923:84). An attempt has been made to determine the range of occurrence of the bow-lance. The results of this inquiry are summarized in Table 1. It is difficult to know how complete the information may be, due to the varying quan tities and qualities in the ethnographic record Table 1. Distribution of the Bow-lance Among Plains Indian Tribes.

All speak Siouan except the Arikara (Caddoan) and Cheyenne (Algonquian). If the distribution indicated in Table 1 is correct, perhaps it can be postulated that the bow-lance originated fairly recently in that area, as a part of the warrior society phenomenon. Perhaps it grew Fig. 5. "Sitting Bull counting 'coup' on a white man" by striking him with a bow (after Stirling 1938:17). from the prevailing custom of counting coup with a bow by grasping it at one end and swinging it like a club (see Fig. 5). Two native sources show the bow-lance in action. In one, the autobiography of Sitting Bull and Jumping Bull (Stirling 1938), the lance is shown being held as if it were a bow used for counting coup ? that is by the end (Fig. 6, 7). The other, Bad Heart Bull's history, shows the lance being carried by the end in one case, but in another (Blish 1967:PI. 144) it is grasped around the middle and effectively used as a lance. One thing seems certain: if a person chooses to count coup with a bow, he will find it safer if the bow is several feet long and equipped with a lance head. Bow-lances have been recorded in rock art in the northwestern plains, at Writing-On Stone in southern Alberta (Keyser 1977:39) and at Pictograph Cave in central Montana (Mulloy 1958:128,130). It is interesting to note that several of these images occur with "shield-bearing warriors" which Keyser dates at late prehistoric to early historic and associates with Shoshone ethnic groups (Keyser 1977:55). If this interpretation is correct it is curious because the Shoshonean Comanche apparently carried neither the bow-lance nor the shield-bearing warrior (as an artistic convention) with them as they migrated into the southern plains. How can it be explained that in the heart of the range occupied by the Kiowa Comanche alliance there is found on a sand stone bluff an engraving depicting a group of weapons and among them are two images of a ceremonial lance typical of tribes whose homelands lie far to the north?

Detail of a Blackfoot painted hide purchased by Maximilian in 1833 (after Thomas and Ronnefeldt 1976:17). Indian art, ethnology and history come clues which appear to provide an answer. The importance of counting and recount ing coups among Plains Indians has been noted (Lowie 1954:108-112). Each group had a complicated system for ranking coups. Striking the enemy with the hand or some thing held in the hand was generally con sidered the height of bravery, far more exalted a deed than killing the enemy. Stealing horses was regarded as a second important means of counting coup. Much of PIPPA and Plains Indian rock art is devoted to the task of recording and communicating coups of these two types. One other recognized act of bravery, at least among certain tribes, was the capture of weapons (Driver 1961:323; Lowie 1954:108). Among the Blackfeet the capture of a shield, bow, gun, war bonnet, war shirt, or medicine pipe was deemed a coup (Grin nell 1962:248). Prince Maximilian purchased a painted buffalo hide from a Blackfoot at Fort Union in 1833 upon which were illustrated "the deeds of an outstanding warrior. . . captured rifles, bows and arrows, scalps taken, and stolen horses are all repre sented ..." (Thomas and Ronnefeld 1976: 17; Fig. 8, this paper). On the robe several exploits are shown, and, in a much larger scale, a group of weapons, including two flint locks, three bows, two arrows, two quivers, a lance and a lance head. Bodmer (Thomas and Ronnefeld 1976:137) renders a robe worn by a Piegan upon which bows and guns "in dicate weapons captured". Barbeau (1960: 89) illustrates a buffalo skin of unknown origin upon which are shown horse stealing, com bat scenes, hunting exploits and weapons. The latter are placed in a neat row and are drawn considerably larger than are the weapons involved in the combat depicted. A rifle, a powder horn, and two tomahawks are shown, along with three unidentified objects. One of these has much the same profile as 265</page><page sequence="10">a rifle but appears to have long fringes under the "barrel" and at the "butt". It may rep resent a leather rifle case. The second unidentified object looks like a fringed bag. The third is a bundle-like figure very similar to those seen above the weapons group at Mujares Creek. Once again a close agreement between Plains Indian rock art and PIPPA is observed. Thinking of the petroglyph panel at Mujares Creek as a depiction of captured weapons facilitates the explanation of the presence of bow-lances in the group. Historical facts fall very neatly into place. In 1826, several bands that would become the Southern Cheyenne broke off from the parent tribe and moved south to the Arkansas River in southeastern Colorado, to be near Bent's Fort (Hoebel 1960:3; Grinnell 1915:35). This put them hard against the Kiowa and their allies, the Comanche, and bitter conflict was the rule until a permanent peace was made in 1840. According to Mails (1973:326-329) and Lowie (1916c:877-992) there were two soci eties among the Cheyenne who carried the bow-lance: the Coyote or Fox Soldiers, who possessed four of the ritual weapons, and the Bowstring or Inverted Society, in which each warrior carried a bow-lance. Grinnell (1923) did not mention use of the bow-lance by any Cheyenne other than the Contraries. Llew ellyn and Hoebel (1941:99) suggested that the Bowstring Soldiers have perhaps been con fused with the Contraries. In any case, the Bowstring Society of the Cheyenne, including four Contraries, suffered a "disastrous anni hilation" in 1837 at the hands of the Kiowa and Comanche, who completely destroyed a party of 42 warriors (Hoebel 1960:72-73; Grinnell 1915:42-59). This is believed to have taken place in the eastern Panhandle of Texas "on a small tributary of Scott Creek, an upper branch of the North Fork of the Red River (Grinnell 1923:45). A return engage ment was fought in 1838 on Wolf Creek in the northeast corner of the Panhandle, with heavy losses on both sides. Mooney (1893:271-273) gives the Kiowa account of these fights. Figure 15 reproduces the Kiowa winter count version. The weapons panel at Mujares Creek could refer to any conflict between the north ern allies and the Kiowa-Comanche between Fig. 9. Detail of a Mandan buffalo-robe painting acquired by Lewis and Clark and sent to Thomas Jefferson in 1805 (after Ewers 1968:9). 266</page><page sequence="11">1826 and the peace treaty in 1840, but cer tainly it would seem that the 1837 decimation of the Bowstring Society, including at least four Contraries, was the event most likely to have produced captured bow-lances. In summary, the Mujares Creek petroglyph site seems analogous to many robes painted by the Plains Indians of the first half of the 19th century. Counting coup of at least three kinds seems to be represented: striking and/or killing the enemy, stealing horses and cattle, and capturing of weapons. The pres ence of the cattle, which are not seen commonly in pre-reservation Plains Indian pictorial art, may be explained by the close proximity of the Santa Fe Trail, which began to carry many oxen in about 1830. The artists were most likely Kiowa, but could possibly have been Comanche, and the petroglyphs probably date from the 1830's. The function of the site was presumably the same as that of the skin paintings and ledger drawings, coup stories and dances, and special regalia and insignia of the Plains Indians. The Mujares Creek Site served as a record and reminder of the achievements of the warrior artists who produced it. For this purpose to be realized, it would follow that the site was one which could reasonably be expected to be revisited. As such, it is likely to have been located near an often-used camp or trail. This idea should be tested as a part of any further study by a search for signs of occupation near the site. The Verbena Site Carved into an alcove under a sandstone bluff near Verbena, Garza County, Texas (Fig. 1), are two small panels of petroglyphs, referred to here as the north and the south panels. Rough sketches of the Verbena Site have been published by Riggs (1965:11,14), and rubbings and photos made by this writer in 1966 are in his possession and at Southern Methodist University. The latter copies, as reproduced in Figures 10 and 11, are pub lished here for the first time. Two distinct types of petroglyphs are represented at Verbena. These may have been produced by separate groups of artists or, perhaps, for two distinct social functions within the same group. The central area of the north wall is occupied by a series of deep, poorly organized grooves (Fig. 10). The least amorphous element of this group is a stalked circle with radiating lines, vaguely like a flower. At the periphery of this group and on the east wall is a series of well-executed engravings, rendered in finer, shallower lines. Human and animal forms, as well as some unidentified shapes, are seen (Fig. 10, 11). Five human figures appear at the Verbena site, one of which is an inconspicuous stick figure (a sixth possible anthropomorph is seen at the right in Fig. 10). The remaining four are somewhat distinct, stylistically, from depictions of anthropomorphs in other historic rock art sites in the Panhandle area. The Verbena Site figures are frontally posed, with arms extended downward in two cases and bent upward at the elbow in two others. The latter have fingers indicated and one has feet with toes shown in profile. The trait that most sets them apart, however, is the treatment of the interior spaces of the figures by filling them with series of parallel and intersecting lines. Another unusual trait is the element shown between the legs of two of these figures, which could be interpreted either as sexual organs or loincloths. In one case, two figures appear in a single composition (Fig. 11, above and right of center). These do not seem to be in conflict, like those at Mujares Creek, but rather in an attitude of camaraderie, one with its arm on the other's shoulder. Attached to one of these figures by a line is a bow and arrow with the arrow shown beside the bow, unengaged. This may simply indicate that the subject was armed, but it might also represent a name glyph or some similar device. Name glyphs are used in many late Plains Indian pictorial art forms, and were usually connected to the named subject by a line. One other item at the Verbena Site deserves notice. One anthropomorph (Fig. 10) wears draped over its head an inverted image of a bird, with wings, tail feathers, head and beak carefully depicted. Many groups on the Plains wore bird headdresses on occasion (Mails 1973:106-108), but these were usually worn upright. Birds were often used as name glyphs for people in censuses and winter counts; these usually are shown above the head (Mallery 1883:174-180). These birds, too, are usually shown upright; in one case (Praus 1962:22), however, an inverted bird is shown above the head of a man to indicate 267</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 10.

All of the above listed components of the Verbena Site, and some others left unde scribed, are of considerable interest and require further study. There is one large composition, however, that lends itself espe cially well to comparison with certain PIPPA compositions. The remainder of the discus sion of this site will focus upon this complex group. Riggs wrote that "No European influence is noted" at the Verbena Site, and reasoned that these petroglyphs may then have been earlier than two other, obviously historic, loca tions he reported (Riggs 1965:11). Historic elements are present at the site; however, it is only after seeing similar elements in PIPPA that they can be easily recognized for what they are, and, to a considerable extent, interpreted. The composition (lower half of Fig. 11) in question is rather large. It covers an area a meter long by a meter high. The group is made up of seven simple symbols, five of which are easily recognizable PIPPA ideo graphs, and a human figure. Central to the composition is a series of thirty-eight lines, generally vertically oriented, 2 to 4.5 cm long, with small appended triangles extending left ward from their bases. These are almost certainly simplified drawings of rifles. They are essentially identical to flintlocks depicted at Mujares Creek (see Fig. 2, No. 13), except that the frizzens are omitted (for an example of a nearly identical drawing of a rifle, with only a stock and barrel shown, see Ewers 1968:Fig. G). Two arrows or lances are shown striking at the rifles from the right. Another possible lance is seen to the left of the group. Above the left end of the rifles is a bow in the characteristic coup-counting position. A bow held in this position in autobiographical com bat scenes in PIPPA usually means counting coup (Stirling 1938:17,18; Mallery 1893:573), but in the abbreviated ideographic form, as in winter counts and censuses, a bow shown striking a person is often interpreted as meaning "killed" (Stirling 1938:658-59; Mallery 1883:130-35). Below and to the left of the rifle group is a series of twenty-one crescentic signs. This symbol in Plains Indian pictorial art represents horse tracks and refers to horses. This is probably the most widely used ideograph in Plains Indian pictorial art and it can express many ideas, according to the context (Fig. 12-14,16). Usually movement by horseback is involved, and direction of travel is indicated Fig. 12. "Runs-by-the Enemy. Red Cloud's Census. This figure suggests a feat of special courage and fleetness in making a circuit of a hostile force" (after Mallery 1893:579). by orientation of the tracks. For instance, horse tracks inside a circle, or tightly grouped, can mean "horses captured" (Mallery 1893: 658); tracks moving away from a circle, "horses stolen" by an enemy (Mallery 1893: 657); tracks massed around a circle, pointing inward, "attack" or "surround" (1893:653). In the Verbena Site example, the horse tracks below the rifles point inward, and those on the left turn away from the rifles to point to the left. A series of short horizontal lines, or dashes, is seen beginning at the left end of the rifle group and extending in a band through the horse tracks and to an anthropo morph situated somewhat away from the rest of the composition. Dashes of this type are very common in Plains Indian pictorial art and represent human tracks. These are almost always seen in conjunction with horse tracks, and usually together they indicate action in which some participants are mounted and some are afoot (see Fig. 13, 14, 16). Other elements in the composition, less 269</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 13. "The Dakota killed one hundred white men at Ft. Phil. Kearny. American-Horse's Winter Count, 1866 '67. The hats and the cap-covered head represent the whites; the row of characters around them, rifle or arrow shots; the black strokes (dashes), Dakota footmen; and the hoof-prints, Dakota horsemen" (after Mallery 1893: 563). easily identified, are two circular excavated areas, possibly shields, to the left of and above the rifles, and eight featureless lines at the right end of the group (perhaps these represent unarmed enemies killed). One petroglyph, between the two shield-like ele ments, may not be part of the composition; it more closely resembles the formless grooves found in the center of the northern panel. To recapitulate, four common Plains In dian pictorial art ideographs (horse tracks, people-tracks, coup-bow, and lances or ar rows) are present in this composition. A fifth, the rifles, is not often found in such simplified form, but is easily recognized in this context. Three separate signs (lances, bow, horse tracks) point toward the rifle group; they all have military meaning: attack, kill, count coup. Comparison with some ideographic battle depictions in Plains Indian pictorial art is informative. Figure 13 depicts a battle in which the Dakotas attacked and killed a large number of white men. The white men, in the center, are symbolized by European hats and a head. The arrows of many battle scenes (Fig. 15) are replaced here by the T-shaped sign, another common PIPPA convention, Fig. 14. "They captured a train of wagons near Tongue River. The men who were with it got away. American Horse's Winter Count, 1867-'68" (After Mallery 1893: 570). which signifies a hit, most often by gunfire (Mallery 1893:562-563). Both mounted and unmounted Dakota surround the Euroameri cans. Figure 14 shows a wagon likewise surrounded. The massacre of the Cheyenne Bowstring Soldiers by the Kiowa in 1837 is depicted in Figure 15; Mooney (1898:271) describes the drawing as a "conventional Indian symbol for battle." Fig. 15. "Summer, 1837. Cheyenne massacred" (after Mooney 1898:271). 270</page><page sequence="15">An interpretation of the right side of the composition at Verbena as a battle or attack seems incontrovertable. Rifles are often shown in Plains Indian pictorial art to repre sent enemies, usually in the act of firing (Ewer 1939:PI. 14; Barbeau 1960:PI. 16, 16a-16c). Considering the large number of rifles de picted, a Euroamerican opponent is sug gested, perhaps but not certainly, military. The severity of the Euroamerican losses can not be ascertained, though it is possible that each rifle represents an armed man slain, with the nondescript lines to the right of the rifles perhaps being tallies of unarmed per sons. Conversely, the bow and lances could possibly refer only to coup counts, which are not even necessarily fatal, but the most common meaning of the ideographic coup bow, as seen here, is "killed" (Mallery 1893:659) (Of interest in this context is the ledger drawing, by Red Horse, of "Custer's Dead Cavalry", at the Battle of Little Big Horn, in Mallery 1893:564-65. A large group of soldiers is shown, with dismemberment and decapitation making it obvious that they are very dead. Red Horse, however, emphasized the point by drawing an oversized bow and two huge arrows in the picture, and surrounds it, on three sides, by inward pointing horse tracks). Thus far it can be said with some certainty that an attack is represented by the Verbena composition, and that, probably, there were losses on the side of the whites. There is evidence, however, that some escaped, at least for a while. This is shown by the string of human tracks leading away from the battle, and pursuit is indicated by the horse tracks that turn to follow. For comparative purposes, see Figure 16 which illustrates two of the exploits of Lean Wolf, a Hidatsa chief (Mallery 1893:581). In the upper portion of the picture the Sioux leave their camp, shown by tipis, and walk to the Hidatsa camp (the dotted circle within a square), where they steal some horses and ride away. Lean Wolf leaves the Hidatsa camp and follows on foot. He catches the Sioux, kills one with a war club, scalps him, and, now mounted, returns with the horses. A similar story is told in the lower half ^ -,yW- ------- S Fig. 16. "Lean-Wolf's exploits" (after Mallery 1893:581). 271</page><page sequence="16">of the picture. In these examples it can be seen how routes can be indicated and action depicted by showing the tracks left by the participants. Unfortunately, no clear clues were left concerning the conclusion of the Verbena battle story. The human figure on the left can probably be identified as an Indian on a stylistic basis, but the role he played and the lot he drew that day will possibly never be known. In summary, the more developed Verbena Site petroglyphs seem to represent a com bination of two artistic traditions. The human figures at the site appear to be stylistically distinct from anthropomorphs in PIPPA. The artist who produced the battle scene, how ever, had a detailed knowledge of the ideography of the Plains Indians. Possibly he had been exposed to two artistic traditions and blended them at Verbena. The authors of the Verbena petroglyphs were most likely Comanche, but could also have been Kiowa. This conclusion is based mostly on the site's location in the heart of the Comanche/Kiowa range. A search for stylis tically similar human figures should be made along the Plains Indian rock art sites, espe cially those attributed to the Shoshone, who are the closest kin to the Comanche. Additional ethnohistoric research might possibly link the battle composition at Ver bena with a specific event. A survey of military encounters between Comanches or Kiowas and fairly large bodies of Euroamericans might produce a case in which the Indians attacked a group, and there was subsequent flight and pursuit. CONCLUSIONS This study has produced a number of interesting results. First, and perhaps most important, it has been demonstrated that the portable pictographic art of the Plains Indians shares much, in terms of form, content, and function, with at least some of the historic rock art found in the Southern plains. This extends into this area the applicability of the tech niques used by Keyser (1977, 1987) in his important studies of historic rock art in the northwestern plains. Use of this "lexicon", as Keyser has termed it, opens the door to a level of interpretation previously unsuspected, and may, as we have seen, make possible identification of specific historical events depicted, and thus allow close dating of indi vidual rock art sites or compositions. By pointing out the functional equivalence of certain rock art sites to pictographic records of exploits of Plains Indian warriors, seen on robes, tipis, ledgers, and other port able art, we can posit a form of social/ritual activity unreported, to my knowledge, by ethnographic accounts. These were gather ings at stone outcrops where rock art could be rendered, for the purpose of recording and recounting of coups (this function has been previously suggested for rock art sites at Writing-On-Stone by Keyser [1977:53]). Since recounting of coups as reported in the ethnographies was a repetetive act, it is likely that the rock art sites were also intended for reuse, so that, at the time the art was pro duced, the artist anticipated revisiting the site. The Plains Indians during the equestrian bison hunting days were surely one of the most mobile of all human societies. Such lifeways, of necessity, required an almost entirely portable material culture. Yet we have seen that at least some plains groups pro duced "artifacts", namely rock art sites, which were entirely non-movable. Another such non-portable "artifact" produced by all peoples, however nomadic, is the living spot, or occupation site. At least in Texas, camp sites of late historic plains groups are almost unreported. This is probably due, in part, to wide spacing of lodges and short spans of occupation, conditions which produce a diffuse archaeological deposit which is dif ficult to find. One implication of the probable repeated use of rock art sites as coup re counting stations is that campsites and trails must be located nearby, whether they were used by the entire band or by some male fraction of it. Consequently, we should be able to predict that occupation sites can be located in the vicinity of Mujares Creek and other rock art sites of its type. Such sites, even if ex tremely diffuse, should be findable by metal detector sweeps in likely-looking spots in the area. The archaeological potential of the rock art sites themselves is also considerable, especially since artifacts used in producing the petroglyphs are likely to have been left behind. In addition to the above rather generalized results, we have been able to learn a good 272</page><page sequence="17">deal about the Mujares Creek and Verbena sites in particular. At Mujares Creek we find that the site was used as a coup recounting station, apparently at least in part by mem bers of the Comanche/Kiowa alliance during their war with the Cheyennes in 1826-1840. At the Verbena Site one composition is found to represent a battle in which a large party armed with many rifles, presumably Euro americans, was attacked by the Indians and many were slain, or, at least, had coups counted against them, with some escaping with Indians in pursuit. This new knowledge about these two sites gives us an increased appreciation of their historical and cultural value. It is hoped that it also enhances the possibility that such sites, which are usually fragile and very vulnerable to vandalism, will be preserved and protected by landowners and local citizens.
