Routledge Ency- clopedia of Narrative Theory. London and New York: Routledge, 2005. xxxix  + 718 pp. $210.00 cloth. 1 The Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory, published under the editorship  David Herman, Manfred Jahn, and Marie-Laure Ryan, is more than a new dictionary  of narratology 1.  It is an unprecedented work that defines and examines thousands of  terms and concepts, distributed in four hundred fifty articles and related to narrative  in all its forms and in all the variety of its media, formats, periods, genres, and sub- genres. This innovative encyclopedia concerns students, teachers, and researchers,  all those who recognize “the very predominance of narrative as a focus of interest  across multiple disciplines” (x), whether in history, philosophy, psychology, anthro- pology, discourse analysis, or literary studies. However, we might consider whether  the notion of “theory” here is likely to be a simple metaphor. The list of articles  in this very rich volume can be easily divided in historical accounts (on schools  or trends, such as the “Tel Aviv School of Narrative Poetics”), methodological ac- counts (on the different approaches to narrative, from “Computational Approaches  to Narrative” to approaches more inspired by the humanities), or lexical accounts  (on concepts or notions, more or less linked to the original terminology of such and  such author), all accounts of varying length. The volume also contains  the presenta- tion of problems, old and new, from plot structure to the literary representation of  thought and consciousness, that feed theoretical reflection on narrative.2 The editors  chose not to devote articles to individual theoreticians (but the bio-bibliographic  information concerning them can be accessed through the index).  The ambition of the Encyclopedia is not only to present the history, the  conceptual and methodological tools, and the terminology of narrative theory or  “narrative studies” but first and foremost to underline its importance and topical  interest. Apprehending two new phenomena was the main focus for the editors in  their work. The first one is well known in the Anglo-Saxon world as the “narra- tive turn.” In the last twenty years this transformation has put the problematics of  narrative at the center of not only historical, ethnographical, and psychoanalytical  thought, but also juridical, political, and even medical, thus endowing narrative  theory the status of a new paradigm for knowledge theory. In the article “Narra- Style: Volume 39, No. 4, Winter 2005 479 </page> <page sequence="2"> Describing the Circle of Narrative Theory 481 tive Turn in the Humanities,” Martin Kreiswirth gives an extensive, rigorous, and  well-informed presentation of this phenomenon. His article also contains a number  of cross-references to the index or to other entries in the volume (see in particular  “Ethnographic Approaches to Narrative,” “Historiography,” “Law and Narrative,”  “Medicine and Narrative,” “Psychoanalysis and Narrative”). The “narrative turn”  and the new uses it defines for the word “story” also form the subject of the first part  of  Ryan’s article “Narrative,” which I will come back to. The second phenomenon  is the renaissance of narratology in a plural, diversified form: Narratologies, sig- nificantly, is the title of a collective work published in 1999 under the direction of  David Herman. In the introduction to this work, David Herman proposes the term  “postclassical narratology,” taken up in Luc Herman and Bart Vervaeck’s article,  “in order to group the various efforts to transcend ‘classical’ structuralist narratol- ogy, which has been reproached for its scientificity, anthropomorphism, disregard  for context, and gender-blindness” (450; also see the entries “Implied Reader,”  “Narrative,” “Natural Narratolology,” “Cultural Studies Approaches to Narrative,”  “Gender Studies,” and “Feminist Narratology”). However, one can wonder, when  reading some of the articles in the Encyclopedia (“Education and Narrative,”  “Medicine and Narrative,” “Narrative Psychology,” “Narrative Therapy,” “Theol- ogy and Narrative,” all of great interest on their own), if the encounter of certain  disciplines of the “narrative turn” with the new narratology, with its postclassical  and poststructuralist features, is just due to circumstances and if it does not derive  from an editorial strategy rather than a true synergy.  Among the most represented disciplines in the Encyclopedia are cognitive  science and the different disciplines which compose it, always considered in their  relation to narration (see “Artificial Intelligence and Narrative,” “Biological Foun- dations of Narrative,” “Computational Approaches to Narrative,” “Psychological  Approaches to Narrative,” “Semiotics,” etc.). The “narrative turn” in cognitive  science is mentioned in Howard Mancing’s article on “Biological Foundations of  Narrative”: “A growing number of neuroscientists, biologists, cognitive psycholo- gists, and philosophers have stressed that the human mind/brain is less a computer  than a storyteller” (44). He goes on to quote successively Michael S. Gazzaniga, a  neuroscientist; Daniel C. Dennett, a philosopher; Merlin Donald, a psychologist;  and  Mark Turner a literary theorist, author of The Literary Mind 3, .  Parallel to this,  the cognitive approach to narrative determines a full branch of postclassic narratol- ogy, “Cognitive Narratology,” which is the subject of an outstanding article in all  respects by Manfred Jahn and which is also represented in the Encyclopedia by  Catherine Emmott (“Narrative Comprehension”), Monika Fludernik (“Experien- tiality,” “Time and Narrative” and, with Jan Alber, “Natural Narratology”), David  Herman ( “Narrative as Cognitive Instrument,” and “Storyworld”), among others.  “From a cognitive vantage,” Jahn writes at the beginning of his article, “many of  the common sense positions of ‘classical’ narratology have to be approached with  due scepticism” (67). This scepticism—about the postulate of “immanence” or  the structural closing of narrative, for example—and the will to put such problems  </page> <page sequence="3"> 480 Sylvie Patron of classical narratology as “Embedding,” “Focalization,” “Narrative Situations,”  and “Reliability” into the perspective of cognitive science can be found in almost  all articles of narratological inspiration in the Encyclopedia. That is also the case  of the article “Narrative,” one of the longest in the volume. It is signed by Ryan,  which at once gives it a manifesto value. In the last part, entitled “Story as Cognitive  Construct,” after recalling the narratological definition of narrative as a combina- tion of “story” and “discourse,” Ryan establishes that only the story can be defined  autonomously, differently from the narrative discourse that is defined by its abil- ity to represent that which constitutes story: “Story, like narrative discourse, is a  representation, but unlike discourse it is not a representation encoded in material  signs. Story is a mental image, a cognitive construct that concerns certain types  of entities and relations between theses entities. . . . Narrative may be a combina- tion of story and discourse, but it is its ability to evoke stories in the mind that  distinguishes narrative discourse from other text-types” (347). Ryan then lists the  necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the “story” to exist in the cognitive sense:  the image of a world populated with individuated agents (called “characters”) and  objects; a series of different states of affairs, linked by a nonnatural chain of cause  and effect, notably by intentional actions of characters; association of these actions  with mental states and events (goals, plans, emotions). (Ryan points out further on  that this condition can be flouted in some postmodern novels.)  As she says, “The  property of being a narrative can be predicated of any semiotic object, whatever the  medium, produced with the intention to create a response involving the construc- tion of a story” (347). Ryan is also the author of the article “Media and Narrative,”  which shows the same quality of information and speculative seriousness (also  see all the articles, by various authors, on story in nonverbal media: “Dance and  Narrative,” “Digital Narrative,” “Film Narrative,” “Music and Narrative,” “Opera,”  “Photographs,” “Pictorial Narrativity,” “Television,” “Visual Narrativity,” etc., as  well as those on “Intermediality,” “Adaptation,” and “Remediation”). As far as narratology is concerned, the Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative  Theory attests that all sorts of contextualization have now supplanted the study  of textuality (see the articles “Cultural Studies Approaches to Narrative,” “Femi- nist Narratology,” “Gender Studies,” “Post-Colonialism and Narrative,” “Queer  Theory”). Thus, in those articles, the Encyclopedia may run the risk of redundancy:  the article “Gender Studies” for instance, by Gaby Allrath and Marion Gymnich,  includes a part entitled “Gendered Narratology,” prolonged by another part headed  “From the Late 1990s Onwards: Recent Development,” which adds very little to  the article “Feminist Narratology,” also written by a great representative of the  area, Robyn Warhol. We can also notice the presence of satellite-articles (“Alter- ity,” “Coming-out Story,” “Gaze,” “Hybridity,” “Slash Fiction”), which sometimes  produce involuntary comical effects: “Like all genres, slash is continually evolving  and today the term is widely used to describe female/female (F/F) homoerotic fan  fiction as well as male/male. Purists, however, insist that slash refers only to the  latter” (536). Beyond these selected remarks, it is particularly difficult for a French  </page> <page sequence="4"> Describing the Circle of Narrative Theory 483 reader to express an opinion on the validity, relevance or importance of these ap- proaches or these eclectic “theories. 4” 2 Because academics know, from experience, that dictionaries and encyclopedias are  also instruments to construct the reality that they seem to describe, I would like  to go a little further in the exploration of the Encyclopedia. I will focus here on  the narratology (or narrative poetics) part, leaving aside the study of nonliterary  forms of narrative. In this part, the resolutely modernist perspective, indeed avant-gardist, of the  Encyclopedia, which rejects or keeps a distance from the older research programs  qualified as “traditional,” is accompanied by a certain lack of perspective and a  difficulty in distinguishing between really founding works and mediating works or  articles (see for example the article “Historiographic Narratology,” which is entirely  based on Cohn, chapter 7, or the article “Metalepsis,” which without justifying it  soundly, asserts the “centrality” of this figure “for narrative theory, placing it along- side metaphor and metonymy” [303]). These are flaws that we can think inevitable  and that even the inexperienced reader can easily put right. But the narratological part of the Encyclopedia also clearly appears to be  lacking in epistemological reflection, if we mean by that the commonly accepted  epistemology: the one attested by notions of hypothesis, test, and falsification.5  More often than not, propositions of postclassical narratology, like those of clas- sical structuralist narratology, fall within a kind of spontaneous epistemology,  which is also a minimalist epistemology, based on a small number of axioms, such  as “the axiomatic narratological dichotomy between story and discourse” (609),  and of primitive terms, such as the term “narrator” defined as the utterer of the  story. Consequently, the contradictions that appear when we read the Encyclopedia  continuously are likely to remain unsolved. What should we think, for instance, of  the “Possible World Theory,” which is presented in a detailed and reliable manner  by Ryan but which also brings forth this remark by David Gorman in the article  “Fiction (Theories of)”: “Its failure to gain universal acceptance thus far may have  something to do with the elaborate metaphysical apparatus it involves—the theo- retical question is whether the concept of possible worlds offers the simplest way  to explain fictionality” (166). In the same article, Gorman devotes one part and not  the least, since it is the last one,  to “signposts of fictionality,” the identification  and description of which have made up and still make up the research program  of numerous literary theorists, in spite of John Searle’s assertion that “no purely  linguistic or textual property of narrative can serve as a criterion of fictionality”  (166; also see Searle 65–68). The position adopted here by Gorman completely  contradicts the conclusion of the article “Mimesis,” by Jean-Marie Schaeffer and  Ioana Vultur, who is in line with Searlian theories: “So, the only remaining pos- sibility seems to be to distinguish fictional and factual narratives in purely func- tional terms, i.e., in terms of different epistemic and pragmatic uses” (310). Whom  should we believe? But the most glaring and important contradiction concerns the  </page> <page sequence="5"> 482 Sylvie Patron narrator-based definition of narrative in classical and postclassical narratologies  and the “no-narrator theory” of which Ann Banfied has given the most complete  version and which she herself presents in an article of the Encyclopedia. The fact  is rare enough to be mentioned,6 and we may think that Manfred Jahn, author of  two journal articles totally or partially devoted to Banfield’s works,  has suggested  her collaboration to the Encyclopedia. In his 1992 article, Jahn saw in “Banfield’s  formidable formalisms” and in her “less than lucid style” the reasons for her being  kept in the background by the literary theorists (347). Here she has a relatively brief  article, but it has clarity, absence of contradictions, logical consistency, continence  in metaphors,7 in short all the characteristics proper in general to scientific style.  “The ‘no-narrator theory,’” she writes, “holds that certain sentences of fiction do  not occur in the spoken language and cannot be said to be uttered by a narrator, if  that term is understood to denote a first person, either covert or overt” (396).8 A  sentence in free indirect discourse in the third person is an example of it, linguistic  tests showing that it cannot be attributed partly to a character and partly to an ut- terer or to a covert narrator without losing its essential characteristics.9  ,  The other  example of an “unspeakable” sentence is the sentence of pure narrative, marked by  the use of the preterite (or passé simple in French) and the exclusion of the pair of  interlocutors I/you. Banfield is here closely akin to Émile Benveniste’s analysis of  the utterance he calls “historical” (and which Banfield suggests naming “narrative  utterance” or more accurately “narration”). Benveniste writes of such a sentence:  “No one speaks here; the events seem to narrate themselves. The fundamental  tense is the aorist, which is the tense of the event outside the person of a narrator”  (208).10 These considerations form the basis of a linguistic theory of narrative,  based on a clear distinction between oral language and written language: “Spoken  sentences may lack an explicit I, but they are not speakerless in the relevant sense,  the speaker’s presence guaranteeing the possibility of I. But in writing, the author’s  relation to text differs from the speaker’s to discourse. . . . Rather than ‘speaking’  in a text, the author creates a fictional world out of language, whether or not this  language is attributed to a narrator” (Benveniste 208).  Reading the article “No-Narrator Theory” (which we can complement by read- ing “Skaz” and “Tense and Narrative,” also signed by Banfield) may modify the  perception we can have of other articles on narratology in the Encyclopedia 11.  We  can, for example, immediately notice the articles which use the autocontradictory  expression “third-person narrator” (see “Mind Style, Narration, 12” “ ”   “Realism  (Theories of),” “Reliability”). We also notice that, surprisingly, the notion of nar- rator always possesses a kind of apodictic obviousness, for instances in the article  “Indeterminacy”(“While the narrator of a fictional account is considered responsible  for determining what is withheld and what sequence information is given in . . .  ” [241]) and in “Speech Representation” (“. . . direct speech in narrative text is  best characterised as a rhetorical strategy on the part of the narrator . . .” [559]). It  would be wiser to say: “the narrator, when there is one . . . .” Finally we deplore  the confusion between the functions of the author and the narrator—this “I” which  the author quotes— in almost all articles in the Encyclopedia. I will only give a  </page> <page sequence="6"> Describing the Circle of Narrative Theory 485 few examples: “Ryan breaks the concept of narrator down into three underlying  functions: the creative (the narrator’s shaping of the story through the management  of technique; see narrative tecHniQues) . . .” (“Narrator” 388); “Palmer  (2004) argues that the construction of the minds of fictional characters by narrators  and readers are central to our understanding of how novels work . . .” (“Thought  and Consciousness Representation (Literature)” 606); “Mind-style is typically a  matter of the narrator’s use of language to imitate in an implicit way the structure  of the character’s mental self” (“Mind-Style” 311). Concerning the last article  mentioned, we cannot be convinced by the comment made there by Dan Shen  on this passage in William Golding’s The Inheritors, one of the rare extracts of a  literary text quoted in the Encyclopedia: The bushes twitched again. Lok steadied by the tree and gazed. A head and a chest faced  him, half-hidden. . . . A stick rose upright and there was a lump of bone in the middle. . . .  The stick began to grow shorter at both ends. Then it shot out to full length again. Shen’s comment is as follows: “Here, the modern narrator uses the protagonist  Lok’s primitive world-view to transmit the story. From Lok’s perspective, a man’s  raising a bow is perceived as ‘A stick rose upright,’ and the man’s drawing the bow  as ‘The stick began to grow shorter at both ends,’”and so on (311). If the quoted  passage actually expresses the point of view of the protagonist Lok (though here  it appears to be a “narrated” point of view which does not go as far as the enuncia- tive shift proper to the expression of “represented speech and thought”13), what  linguistic evidence do we have of the presence of the point of view of a narrator?  All the sentences in the text belong to the narrative chain in the preterite (in the  passé simple in French, except for “faced” and “there was,” which are translated  in the imparfait); the story seems to tell itself; in other words, it can be understood  without the mediation of a narratorial point of view 14. This is not only a terminological problem (unless the question of terminology  in theories, narrative or others, is taken very seriously); the whole narrative theory  in classical and postclassical narratology must be reconsidered. The propositions  of narratology are valid only in the case of narration in the first person and, when  we adopt its approach to the narratives, we become unable to perceive other forms  and other narrative effects that some authors have particularly attempted to obtain  (I am talking here less about Golding, who may have not deserved as much, than  about authors from the “modernist” movement: James Joyce, Virginia Woolf,  William Faulkner, Malcolm Lowry, and others). The ignorance or dissimulation  of this fact, as well as the absence in the index of the name of S.-Y. Kuroda, who  was the first to denote the “communicational” theory of narration,15 very clearly  attests to the project of linguistic and literary recovery which the Encyclopedia  supports: recovery of the theory of  language, including that of literary language,  as communication, reinforced by pragmatics and “communication studies” (see the  articles “Linguistic Approaches to Narrative,” “Pragmatics,” “Discourse Analysis  (Linguistics),” “Conversational Storytelling,” “Communication Studies and Narra- tive,” “Communication in Narrative,” “Natural Narratology”). In Kuroda’s works,  the communicational theory of narration, influenced by the commun-icational  </page> <page sequence="7"> 484 Sylvie Patron theory of language, was rejected in favor of a “poetic” theory of narration, which  only presupposed the activity of the writer. There was in it an attempt all the more  interesting since it allowed highlighting the cognitive aspect of language, its cen- tral role as instrument of knowledge, representation, aesthetic expression.16 In the  Encyclopedia, Banfield is the only theoretician to present literature and particu- larly narrative literature as a specific experience of the possible form or forms of  language—consequently, as what cannot be adapted or transposed in the media. Notes 1  See Prince. 2  Some of these articles are actually essays in which the authors give the re- sults of extensive research. They come with a bibliography which can contain up  to fifteen titles. 3   To mention the name of a literary theorist in an article in cognitive science  is an exception (which has to do with the fact that Mancing himself is a theorist  of literary narrative). Generally, bibliographies for articles signed respectively by  cognitivists and by narratologists do not match up. Manfred Jahn, in the article  “Cognitive Narratology,” speaks about “fortuitous coincidence” rather than “sys- tematic exchange or exploration” between the “narrative turn” in cognitive science  and the “cognitive turn” in narratology (67). 4  The article “Feminist Narratology” mentions the doubts expressed by Nilli  Diengott concerning the “narratological” or more generally “theoretical” feature  of feminist narratology. 5  Some articles, however, echo the epistemological criticisms expressed towards  some theories (see “Interdisciplinary Approaches to Narrative,” on Bortolussi and  Dixon’s Psychonarratology; or “Natural Narratology,” on Fludernik’s Towards a  Natural Narratology). See as well this remark by Luc Herman and Bart Vervaeck in  “Postclassical Narratology”: “The identification of structuralism as the classical age  of narratology might be contested, especially by empirically oriented scholars, who  have always rejected the lack of testing typical of structuralist endeavour” (451). 6  No entry devoted to Banfield’s theory can be found in Prince’s Dictionary  of Narratology, for example. 7  This is not the case, for example, of the article “Narrator,” by James Phelan  and Wayne C. Booth. 8  The term no-narrator theory does not come from Banfield, who speaks more  generally of narrative theory (that explains her use of quotation marks). 9  The choice of the term free indirect discourse is a consequence of the harmo- nization of vocabulary imposed by the editors of the Encyclopedia. For reasons that  it would be too long to rehearse here, Banfield prefers to say “represented speech  and thought” or “represented consciousness.” It can be noticed that the article “Dual- Voice Hypothesis,” by Brian McHale, author in 1983 of a controversial article on  Banfield, often quoted since, pays a tribute to Banfield’s powerful argumentation,  </page> <page sequence="8"> Describing the Circle of Narrative Theory 487 partially taken up by Monika Fludernik in her Fictions of Language and “New  Wine in Old Bottles.” 10  I would like to point out that some articles of the Encyclopedia subject  Benveniste’s thought to a distortion by establishing a connection between it and  the  narratological dichotomy between “story” and “discourse,” a dichotomy that  has nothing to do with it (see “Speech Representation,” “Structuralist Narratology,”  “Time and Narrative”). 11  I am using the term narratology in the broad sense of “theory of literary  narrative.” It should be clear that Banfield’s theory cannot be subsumed under the  term in the strict sense of the word. See note 5 above. 12  The expression “anonymous third-person narrator” is used here to account for  the beginning of Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, which I quote: “The Nellie,  a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails, and was at rest.  The flood had made, the wind was nearly calm, and being bound down the river, the  only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide. The sea-reach of  the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway. . .  . The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four affectionately  watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward” (my emphasis). 13  Characterized by the combination of preterite or past progressive (of the  imparfait in French) with deictics of the present such as “now” (see Banfield, Un- speakable Sentences ch. 2; and in the Encyclopedia, “Tense and Narrative” 593). 14  We could make the same remarks about the article “Thought and Conscious- ness Representation (Literature),” in which Alan Palmer adopts the model of the  dual voice in free indirect discourse in a noncritical way, as well as about the also  highly problematic notion of omniscient narrator. 15  See Kuroda, “Reflections” 107ff. A theory that defines the story as an act of  language by a narrator is a communicational theory of narration. 16  See the preface by Nicolas Ruwet to the French edition of a collection of  essays by Kuroda.
