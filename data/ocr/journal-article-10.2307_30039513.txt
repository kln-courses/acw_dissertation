<plain_text><page sequence="1">Deodands: A Study in the Creation of Common Law Rules by ANNA PERVUKHIN* The law of deodands traces back at least to the 11th century; it was applied throughout England, sometimes more zealously, sometimes less, but continuously and without interruption, until Parliament finally abol- ished it in 1846. Under this law, a chattel (be it an animal or inanimate object) was deemed to be a deodand whenever a coroner's jury decided that it had caused the death of a human being.l Deodands were automati- cally forfeit to the crown. The term "deodand" derives from the Latin phrase deo dandum, which means "to be given to God." In theory, the crown was supposed to confiscate falling irons and killer pigs, sell them and send the profits to the king's almoner who would eventually apply them toward some pious use.2 In practice, deodands were rarely taken away from their owners. In most cases, the jury that adjudged the deodand also appraised its value; owners were then expected to pay a fine equal to the value of the deodand. If the owner was unable to do so, his township would be held responsible for the fine.3 Nor were the profits often applied to pious uses: sometimes, the money was given to charity or to the vic- tim's family, but more often, it went directly into the royal coffers and intermingled with other sources of revenue.4 As time went on, the crown started selling off the rights to all the deodands from a particular jurisdic- tion to lords, townships and corporations.5 The 12th-century statute establishing the office of the coroner autho- rized the confiscation of deodands as a general matter, but deodand law itself (i.e. how juries decided which animals and objects were deodands) was never governed by statutes. Deodand law was purely common law. *The author is a criminal defense attorney in New York City.

One important rule of deodand law was: omnia quae movent ad mortem sunt deodanda.6 In other words, an animal or object was a deo- dand if its movement was the immediate occasion of a fatal accident.7 If a horse kicked a man in the chest or a stone fell on his head, the horse or the stone would be a deodand.8 All things which moved with the deodand and helped make the wound more dangerous were included, as well.9 When a cart ran someone over, for example, the horses and even the loading would be forfeited.1o A moving object would not be considered a deo- dand, however, if it was affixed to a freehold (i.e., if it was a "fixture").ll Thus, no deodand was due on the door if a gust of wind blew the door open and it struck and killed some unfortunate bystander.12 Church-bells, which were considered fixtures, become exempt, even in cases where the bell or clapper was severed and plummeted.13 6.

The only maxim regarding sta- tionary objects was the "under 14" rule: when a child under the age of fourteen fell from a stationary object, no deodand was due.16 Boats were considered a special case. If a man was killed on a boat that had been sailing in fresh water, the boat was a deodand, but not the load. Thus, when two men drowned attempting to transport 58 sheep, the boat and not the animals was adjudged to be the deodand, even though the sheep were the ones who caused the capsizement by crowding together, as sheep sometimes do, in a tight clump on one side of the boat.17 This article proposes that a number of deodand rules were created inadvertently when jurists tried to impose order on a "messy" legal prac- tice. The facts show that the implementation of deodand law was extreme- ly flexible. As early as the 13th century, juries approached deodand cases the same way they approached criminal cases-prepared to apply the law, but also perfectly willing to bend the rules in order to achieve a desired result. Inevitably, freedom to manipulate the law engendered inconsisten- cies and even contradictions. Early jurists, however, like Sir William Staunford and Sir Edward Coke, were determined to set forth clear-cut rules. Faced with seemingly irreconcilable cases, they struggled to discern patterns, identified what they thought were implied rules and declared them to be common law, all the while convinced they were engaged in exegesis. In fact, what they were doing was more akin to legislation. Deodand determinations were not often challenged in open court (for a variety of reasons) and thus the normal mechanisms by which jurist- made law trickled down to actual juries did not exist. There is little evidence that coroners' juries even knew what the "common law" of deo- dands was, let alone that they ever conscientiously applied'it. Nevertheless, jurists and judges tended to copy their predecessors. Thus, the deodand rules migrated from treatise to treatise, from century to century, and ulti- mately determined how deodands were viewed. In fact, the jurist-made deodand rules tell us much more about the development of common law than they do about the way societies dealt with calamitous accidents. 14.

Thousands more exist only in manuscript form. This paper relies on the printed sources and my conclusions about the implementation of deodand law are, admittedly, better characterized as informed conjectures. For the purposes of this article, however, the printed sources are quite suf- ficient-I am not conducting a quantitative analysis of the case-law and I am not attempting to produce a definitive history of deodands. Rather, my aim is to tell a plausible story about deodands and about deodand law, with an eye toward stimulating a deodand-centered conversation. For my purposes, I've relied on the following types of sources: (1) Coroners' Rolls and Coroners' Bills Since the office of the coroner was established in 1194, it was the coroner's duty to investigate the circumstances of unnatural, sudden, or suspicious deaths.18 Official inquests were held before a coroner's jury. In cases where the coroner's jury determined that a death had been caused by "misadventure", they were also supposed to identify the deodand (if any) and appraise its value.19 The main surviving record of the coroners' hearings is the individual inquests; i.e. the coroners' rolls, which were presented at the eyres and, later, at the commissions of gaol delivery.20 During the 17th and 18th centuries, coroners were no longer required to enroll their inquests, though occasionally judges requested individual inquests when cases came before the King's Bench.21 The best source of information about the activities of more modern coroners are the coro- ners' bills, which they began drawing up after 1752 following the passage of a law providing that coroners should be paid for holding inquests.22 Deodands and their values were consistently omitted, but it is often possi- ble to guess which objects or animals were forfeit.23 (2) Eyre Rolls and Plea Rolls Jurors presentments of coroners' inquests at eyres (which were held between 1194 and 1348) and later at the commissions of gaol delivery were duly recorded alongside other pleas. These official records were terse-often, they simply recorded the circumstances of death and the value of the deodand. 18. R.F. Hunnisett, The Medieval Coroner (Cambridge, 1961) p. 9. 19.

Some of these were eventually printed. Yearbooks collected the earliest reports. The English Reports collected more modem records. In most deodand cases, the authors of the original reports recorded salient fact, noted the jury's findings, and sometimes summarized legal arguments. (4) Secondary Sources Some of the secondary sources I used quote, in particular the articles on deodands by Elisabeth Cawthon and Harry Smith, from primary sources (such as unpublished inquests, old newspaper articles, etc.) that I was not able to access directly. I have included some of this material in the body of data, citing to both the secondary and primary source. Inception and Early Development Prior to 1066, social and legal mechanisms for handling misadven- tures emphasized victim compensation. Sometimes, animals or objects causing serious damage or death, called banes, were handed over directly to the victim or to his family, a practice known as "noxal surrender."24 Early legislation also directed people to pay specified sums of money, called wergild, as compensation for actions (intentional or unintentional) that resulted in someone's injury or death.25 The transition from bane (i.e. an object forfeit to the victim) to deo- dand (i.e. an object forfeit to the crown) seems to have occurred in the decades following the Norman Conquest; the details of that transition remain obscure. By the beginning of the 13th century, however, the deo- dand was treated as a matter of course, and since the printed records date back approximately to that time period, that is where my biography of the deodand will start. One of the earliest printed references to deodands is from 1267, from the Bedfordshire coroner's rolls: 24. Jacob J. Finkelstein, The Goring Ox: Some Historical Perspectives on Deodands, Forfeitures, Wrongful Death and the Western Notion of Sovereignty, 46 Temp. L.Q. 169, 181 (1973). According to the laws of Alfred the Great, for example, which were promulgat- ed in 892-893, "If one man kills another unintentionally [by allowing a tree to fall on him] while they are engaged in a common task, the tree shall be given to the dead man's kindred, and they shall remove it within 30 days from the locality. Otherwise, it shall be taken by him who owns the wood." The Laws of the Earliest English Kings. ed. F.L. Attenborough (Cambridge University Press 1922) p. 71. 25. According to the laws of Alfred the Great, if someone's dog caused an injury its owner had to pay a wergilt ... if a dog tears or bites a man, 6 shillings shall be paid for the first offense. If its owner continues to keep it, 12 shillings shall be paid for the second offense, and 30 shillings for the 3rd. s 1 If the dog disappears after committing any of these offenses, this compensation must nevertheless be paid. s2 if the dog commits more offenses and [the master] still keeps it, he must pay compensation for whatsoever wounds may be inflected, according to the amount of the injured man's full wergild.

Richard the brewer of Christine's house was present, tried to drag her from the vat, lost his foot-hold and fell in. Gregory de Canmori arrived, saw them lying in the vat, raised the hue and called his servant Richard, who dragged them both out. Emma died about vespers on 24th of July, having had the rites of the Church... The vat was appraised at 18d. and the bowl at Id.; they were delivered to the township.26 It seems this was a common death; coroners juries from that period regularly appraised containers that had been used for cooling boiling water: vats, tubs, vessels, dishes, and so on.27 13th- and 14th-century juries also appraised horses, carts, boats, ladders and natural objects (like stones and trees).28 The records do not say what rule the juries were told to apply, but the facts suggest that juries were finding deodands wherever an object was somehow involved in the death of a human being, whether that object "caused" the death or not. In paradigmatic cases (a falling tree killing a man, for example), juries found that an object had "caused" an accident and judged it to be deodand. But there were other times when juries iden- tified a completely independent cause, selected an object that was in the vicinity, and adjudged that to be a deodand. For example, one jury found that the death of a child was "caused by the boiling water" but the jurors still appraised the pot.29 In 1271, John Dreu went to a mill outside his courtyard to fish, "extended a net and by misadventure fell into the river Ivel on the south of the mill and drowned because he was drunk."30 The net was nevertheless adjudged to be a deodand and appraised at 3 pence.31 That same year, a man had a seizure, fell off his horse and died: "William had an illness called palesye, by misadventure [he] fell from his horse and lay there speechless."32 It does not seem the accident had anything to do with the horse's behavior, yet the animal was adjudged to be a deodand.33 One coroner had the jury appraise the goods of the victim in cases where no readily identifiable deodand could be found: "John stood lean- ing against a willow tree, and while sleeping in this position he fell into the said rivulet, and thus died by misadventure ... And he had in goods certain farm stock worth 40 pence, which goods remain in charge of the 26. Bedfordshire, 1267 Bedfordshire Coroner's Rolls, ed. R.F.

Given this kind of flexibility, it should come as no sur- prise that seemingly identical cases were sometimes treated differently. For example, we have already seen cases where vessels for cooling boil- ing water were found to be deodands. But there were other cases of acci- dental scalding where deodands were not appraised.35 In Oxfordshire, a cart and two horses were adjudged to be deodand when a woman named Joan fell out of the cart and died.36 The following year, however, a man named William fell out of a cart and died, and only the horses were deo- dands, not the cart. (Both inquests were held in the same community before the same coroner.) In one Yorkshire case, a man fell from a cart, which subsequently flipped over, pinning him underneath. The jury found that "a stour37 of the cart struck him in the belly, causing his death forth- with. And the said stour is appraised at a half-penny."38 The cart was not deodand. In Bedfordshire, however, Henry Costentin "slipped and he fell upon a pole of the cart so that it entered his fundament." In that case, the cart was appraised together with the horses, harness and wheat.39 In Bedfordshire, a woman named Emma was carrying a bundle of straw when she slipped and fell into a well.40 The straw was adjudged deodand and appraised at 1/2 d. But when a girl named Agnes was crushed to death while gathering straw under a weak wall, neither the straw not the wall was appraised.41 Compare this to a case from 1322, where a jury found that a woman named Sarah, "was lodged in a frail and dilapidated house." One Sunday, "it fell upon her by misadventure, and she died forthwith ... The falled wood and stones are appraised at 12 pence."42 Random regional differences-in practice as well as in reporting- undoubtedly account for some of the variation. Another conclusion may be extracted from this data, however: that jurors tailored their findings to each individual case. In Verdict According to Conscience, Thomas Green argued that "juries were prepared to voice a sense of justice fundamental- ly at odds with the common law from the very outset of the common law 34.

He suggested a number of possible motivations: mercy (technically, all homicide was a capital offense), fear of retribution, parti- sanship, bribery, or perhaps some sort of system akin to the old wergild system. To tests his hypothesis that juries were intentionally nullifying the law, Green examined the correlation between 14th century coroner's indictments and the corresponding verdicts before the royal justices in eyre. He showed that in many cases, people who had apparently commit- ted a homicide would be pardoned because jurors took pains to present the cases in a certain way. As a result, capital punishment was rarely imposed in cases where a homicide seemed excusable, even though the law did not yet recognize the defense of justification. If, in criminal cases, juries were willing to tailor their factual find- ings to achieve a desired result, it does not require a huge leap of imagina- tion to conclude that they were willing to manipulate factual findings in cases of misadventure, also. When juries were identifying and appraising deodands, they would have been under many of the same pressures they were under during inquests of homicide: compassion for the owner of the deodand, fear that the owner would exact revenge, and partisanship of one sort or another. Coroners' juries would have had every reason to push the limits of their discretion. The following is an example of a case where the jury seems to have intentionally made an implausible finding to prevent someone's property from being forfeited: Geoffrey Angulluskey drove a cart ... through his negligence and inebriation the nearside wheel of the cart ran across the head of Julia who lay at the foot of the wall of her mother, Lucy, without any unusual motion [on the part of] the cart or horses ... The value of the wheel is twelve pence; the said wheel killed Julia ... and Geoffrey fled and he has no goods."45 It is evident from the record of the inquest that the coroner held Geoffrey to be morally responsible for Julia's death. It also seems that Geoffrey was not the owner of the wagon (the coroner wrote that "he has no goods", and it seems unlikely that he would have owned a wagon but no other possessions). It is plausible that the coroner and/or his jury were reluctant to forfeit the wagon of an innocent party and so they found that the wheel alone should be forfeit, thereby mitigating the cost of the fine. While it was unusual for an inquest to contain any hints as to the coroner's or the jury's possible motivations for arriving at a particular decision, there were a number of early inquest's where juries appraised 43.

Green, p. 89 footnote 78, citing JUST 2/170, m.1/2.</page><page sequence="9">2005 DEODANDS 245 some, but not all, of what they could have appraised. We have already seen a jury appraising a stour instead of the whole wagon. In a similar case from 1383, a cart ran over a man and crushed him to death. The coroner, William de Ramenham, diligently inquired into the value of the cart and horses but the jurors asserted that it was the wheel that had to be appraised.46 In a case from 1313, a man named Robert of Keston "was dri- ving a certain cart laden with oak trunks in the borough of Sevenoaks, and the cart together with the timber fell upon him."47 In that case, the cart was adjudged to be a deodand but the timber was not. These kinds of cases sug- gest that when early juries had a reason for mitigating the price of the deo- dand, they defined the deodand more narrowly than they could have. In addition to defining deodands very narrowly, juries may have manipulated the results in other ways as well. For one thing, it is possible that instead of telling a true story about a particular accident and making an implausible finding regarding the deodand, coroners and juries simply made up facts regarding the details of the accident itself. This seems par- ticularly likely in cases where objects of little value were said to be at fault: ropes, spoons, ladders, and the like.48 Certainly juries were comfortable manipulating valuations of deo- dands. Meekings has observed that it was "not unusual" to find cases where jurors returned a lower value before the justices at eyre than they had at the original coroner's inquest.49 In London, some ladders were appraised at a dozen times the value of others (2 shillings versus 2 pence).50 A rope from which a man fell was appraised at 10 shillings, approximately the value of a good horse.51 Again, it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons (goods may have fluctuated in value for a whole host of reasons, including inflation and regional variations in supply and demand.) Wildly different appraisals do suggest, however, that coroners and juries must have been taking factors other than the perceived market- value of the deodand into account. Tenacious Survival Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, objects that were said to have caused the death of a person were still being forfeited to the crown on a regular basis, (although they were not being forfeited as frequently as 46.

In 1524, a woman named Margaret was killed when her horse threw her off its back. A coroners' jury found, as it might have centuries before, that "the mare murdered her. It is deodand and worth no more than 5 shillings."52 In 16th-century Sussex, boats, carts, animals and trees were adjudged deodand on numerous occasions.53 The English Reports suggest that the same kinds of objects were being forfeited in the 17th and 18th centuries.54 Juries continued to treat seemingly similar cases differently, which suggests that they were still pushing the limits of their discretion and try- ing to tailor their findings to the circumstances of each particular case. In 1540, for example, Quintin Savyar was killed when his horse kicked him in the chest. The horse was adjudged deodand.55 In 1556, however, a man was killed by a kick from a horse and that animal was not appraised.56 (It is interesting to note that in the second case, the horse belonged to another person. Perhaps the jury felt that the horse was provoked, and didn't want to punish the owner for somebody else's behavior.) In a 1552 case, a woman came upon a man who was felling a beech. "The tree fell and one of its branches by misadventure struck her head, scattering her brains and killing her."57 That tree was appraised at 16 pence, which was eventually paid to the township. In another case, a child was playing in the yard near a piece of wood; "at Margaret's touch by misadventure it suddenly fell on her head and crushed her to death."58 In that case, no price was set at all. Instead, the actual piece of wood itself was delivered to Lewes gaol delivery. There are practical reasons that the two cases might have been treated differently-the tree was worth enough money to bother with the effort of levying a deodand. The individual piece of wood, on the other hand, was probably worth very little. Moreover, it belonged to the child's father. Instead of charging the griev- ing parent a nominal fine, the coroner might have spared him the trouble and confiscated the wood for purely symbolic reasons. To give one last example, in a case from 1618, "It was moved, that a 52. Sussex Corners' Inquests, 1485-1558, ed. R.F. Hunnisett (Sussex Record Society), vol. LXXIV, 1985), p. 15 #59. 53.

Note, as well, that only a minority of cases would have made it before the King's Bench, so any one reference to deodands in the English Reports can been seen as a proxy for hundreds of instances where deodands were appraised and the profits extracted with little or no protest from the parties involved. 55.

In a Sussex case from 1535, a man was run over by a cart. The jury found that "as Herhdam tried to escape from the cart to save his life, the wheel fell violently upon his head ... said wheel thus feloniously killed him."61 Three years later when Henfield Tulley suddenly fell under a cart, the jury found that he "fell under a wheel worth 2 shillings on the left side of the cart ... and thus was feloniously killed, on account of the said wheel .. ." The horses were reprimanded, but not appraised.62 By the end of the 17th century, the Kings Bench came to regard the erratic behavior of coroner's juries with something like tacit approval. In Rex v Cheyney, a lord (presumably the owner of all the deodands that would have been found on his lands) attempted to challenge the finding that the "wheel of a waggon drawn with horses, ran over and killed a child."63 Although he argued that the jury's definition of a deodand was too narrow, the court was not receptive and he lost his case. Rex v. Grew, a similar case from the late 18th century, provides a clearer picture of the court's position. In Grew, the court related that "it was found by an inqui- sition taken by the defendant; that only the near fore wheel of a wagon did move to the death of a man; and that only the near fore wheel was forfeit- ed as a deodand."64 The court upheld the decision even as it acknowl- edged the absurdity of the finding: The Court ought not to contradict the finding of a jury, as to a matter of fact. Upon a motion to quash the inquisition, it was said to be exceedingly improbable, if not altogether impossible; that only the near fore wheel of a waggon should move to the death of a man ... [but] the question in this case was a question of fact, and the jurors have found, that only the near fore wheel of the waggon did move to the death of the man, the Court ought not to quash the inquisition.65 Some scholars think that the practice of forfeiting deodands died out completely in the 18th century. Others have speculated that deodands 59. Mingie's Case, Popham 135, 79 ER 1237 (1618). 60. Lord Chandois' Case, Croke Jac 483, 79 ER 411 (1618). 61. Sussex Coroners' Inquest, 1485-1558, ed. R.F.

By the middle of the 18th century, few of the profits from deodands were going into royal coffers. Rather, lords and local corporations were appropriating deodands that were being exacted in their territories.67 It appears that courts were unwilling to step in where lords and corporations were having trouble extracting deodand profits from their unwilling subjects, but that does not mean individual personalities were never able to extract deodand money on their own. Of course, without the threat of enforcement, such a practice could not continue forever. Just when it seemed that the law of deodands was about to fall into obsolescence, however, the deodand made an unex- pected resurgence. The Deodand's Last Stand With the advent of the industrial revolution in the 19th century, "misadventures," re-conceptualized as "accidental deaths", became increasingly common, particularly in the workplace. The life insurance system was still in its infancy, and even in cases where the deadly acci- dent was caused by an employer's negligence, the family of the victim had no legal recourse. The cause of action was said, (rather anthropomor- phically), to "die with the man". The injustices of the industrial revolution spawned a wide variety of responses, one of which has not received as much attention as some oth- ers: juries began to impose unexpectedly high fines for deodands in cases where the owner of a deadly object bore some responsibility for the dead- ly accident.68 For example, when Thomas Wakley became London coro- ner in 1838, the number of deodands being identified, as well as their price, greatly increased. A deodand of 20 pounds was levied on the timber when the floor of Delafield's brewery collapsed in 1834, killing dozens.69 A deodand of 10 pounds was levied on a cart in an ugly hit and run case in 1839.70 Employing a revealing turn of phrase, coroner William Payne spoke of juries "confining the punishment to a deodand on the wagon" in cases where the owner's negligence did not rise to the level of criminal misconduct.71 High deodands were not merely expressions of outrage-it appears that the proceeds from deodands were sometimes used to compensate the 66.

In 1825, for example, the city of London granted one deodand of e50 to the widow of a hair-dresser who had been run over by a stage- coach and another deodand of e10 to the widow of a common laborer who had accidentally fallen through an open trap door in a floor.72 Other times, the power to levy a deodand was used as a bargaining chip: no deodand would be levied, a jury would hint, if the victim's family was provided for. In 1833, for example, a man drowned in an oil-tank which stood on the property of Mr. Mellish, a wealthy ship-owner. According to the London Times, the coroner suggested in his statement to the jury that no deodand was due because "it could not be supposed for a moment that a gentleman of the enormous wealth of Mr. Mellish would not have used every precaution to prevent the unfortunate accident."73 One of the jurors replied that they might forgo the deodand if Mellish "saw his way clear" to give some financial help to the widow.74 Rail accidents involving steam engines presented juries with a new opportunity. For the first time, they could plausibly levy deodands of hun- dreds of pounds. And so, in the 1830s and 1840s, they began to do so. In 1839, they levied a deodand of e300 against the Grand Junction Railway Company.75 In 1840, they levied deodands of e500, e800, and at length e2,000 against London and Birmingham Railways.76 London and Birmingham Railways had to pay another deodand of e2,000 in 1841.77 The following year, a jury endeavored the levy a deodand of e500 on the same engine several times-once for each of the people who had been injured in the accident.78 Such cases were far from norm (in many instances, juries levied deodands of less than e1) but they generated a lot of controversy.79 That controversy was finally resolved in 1846, when parliament passed the Act for the Abolition of Deodands.80 72.

When Lord Campbell proposed a bill abolishing deodands in 1841, it was met with disfavor. Five years later, he had no trouble getting the Act for the Abolition of Deodands passed.

We see familiar shapes in clouds, mountain ranges, and the moon. We've con- signed the stars to culturally meaningful constellations. So, too, with the law-we have always made laws to organize reality, not just to establish socially useful norms. Thus, while I am cognizant of the dangers of making assumptions about a medieval jurist's mentalitet, I shall proceed from the assumption that a jurist's principal aim, in writing an "abridgement", was to impose order on disorder by setting forth, as best he could, the extant common law rules. But what if there were no extant common law rules, only ephemeral, constantly evolving guidelines? In his major book about the development of the English common law, S.F.C. Milsom answers this question indirectly, describing a number of instances where early jurists attempted to impose order on a "messy" legal practice and inadvertently created new legal rules. Milsom tells us that jurists created the tort of "negligence" because they felt compelled to group all the otherwise unclassified torts under a single heading: The elements from which [negligence] was made existed as a multitude of writs for special situations involving fire, professional misfeasance, unbroken horses in public places, and so on. And writers of abridgments, seeking only a heading more informative than "miscellaneous", brought all these separate torts together under headings like "actions on the case for negligence. What happened, in effect, was that the classification became inverted in lawyer's minds.81 The development of the definition of "trespass vi et armis" is another example of inadvertent law-making. According to Milsom, lawyers-deter- mined to make sense of existing legal procedure-invented a distinction between writs of trespass and writs on the case, unaware that the real rea- son for the division was no longer relevant: ... lawyers did not know, as we do now, that the division between "trespass" and "case" was jurisdictionally accidental: and since it had consequences, for a time, over process, always in the form of a writ, they hunted its essence. The essence that they found was the test of directness. In terms of the plaintiff's writ and count, "direct forcible injury" was the meaning that remained to vi et armis and contra pacem when all the more obvious things they did not mean were set aside. Just as in Milsom's examples, the earliest commentators on deo- dands refused to accept the inherent disorder of customary practice. Just as the compilation of various torts necessitated the creation of neat, even- ly-balanced categories, and the seemingly meaningless distinction between trespass and case demanded an intelligible explanation; likewise, the coroners' rolls and plea rolls concerning cases of misadventure practi- cally begged to be sorted out. Because juries were given a great deal of discretion, legal decisions were inconsistent. Jurists struggled to resolve 81. S.F.C. Milsom, Historical Foundations of the Common Law, Butterworths, (London, 1969) p. 351.</page><page sequence="15">2005 DEODANDS 251 these inconsistencies, and after a while, they inevitably discerned patterns, identified what they thought were implied rules and declared them to be law, all the while convinced they were engaged in exegesis. In fact what they were doing was more similar to legislation. Omnia Quae Movent There is no mention of movement in the original 12th-century statute establishing the office of the coroner: "Concerning horses, boats, carts, and things belonging to a mill by which someone is killed, which things are properly called banes, they are to be arrested and, afterwards, handed over to the township."82 Nor did the early coroners rolls always indicate whether or not the deodand had "moved to death." As we have seen, the 13th and 14th century coroners' rolls suggest that juries were finding deodands wherever an object was somehow involved in the death of a human being. Movement was simply one factor for juries to consider. The brief passage about deodands found in the Fleta, a late 13th-century law tract, mentions movement in passing: if the cause is adjudged to be mischance, then there must be further inquiry into the manner of death as, for example, whether the dead man fell from a mill or a cart or a boat, so long as it is in fresh water, but not if it is in salt water. Those things, moreover that are reputed to be the cause of death, such as a boat with its cargo and all its rigging, a cart with all its load and horses, and all that is move- able in a mill and the like, ought to be appraised ...83 [added emphasis]. Britton also hinted that movement was a relevant consideration in these types of cases: "If [the death happens by a fall] from a Mill, what things were then moving in the Mill? Who owned the Mill? And the value of the utensils then moving; in the same manner let it be inquired of Horses, Houses, Trees and Carriages."84 Like the early coroners' rolls, these early treatises suggest that movement was one among a number of factors, which might have included the behavior and personal circumstances of the object's owner, the community's need for expiation, local tradition, and so on. Movement was not even a pre-requisite. Bracton stated explicitly that moving things were not always deodands, and stationary objects sometimes were: "properly speaking stationary things, as a house or a rooted tree, provide neither the cause nor the occasion [of a misadven- ture], nor do moving things sometimes .. ."85 82.

As time went on, jurists began to discuss movement in more categorical terms. Sir Anthony Fitzherbert was the first to suggest that movement was necessary. ... if it be found he fell from a mill, inquire what things were then moving there and how much they be worth and if he fell out of a cart and if one fall out of a ship nothing shall be judged the cause of his death but the ship and the things that move therein, and not the merchandise lying therein .. ."86 Sir William Staunford cited to Bracton and Fitzherbert in support of the proposition that movement was sufficient: all things which move to death are deodand (omnia quae movent ad mortem sunt deodanda.)87 Sir Edward Coke cited Fitzherbert and the Fleta as authorities for that propo- sition: "when any moveable thing inanimate, or beast animate, does move to, or cause the untimely death of any reasonable creature by mischance .. . without the will, offence, or fault of himself, or of any person, [that thing is a deodand.]"88 Although Sir Edward Coke never denied that resting objects could be deodands also, his maxim recast those types of deodands as exceptions rather than alternatives. By reframing a single factor as an iron-clad rule, the earliest jurists not only changed the way in which deodands were levied, they changed the way deodands were destined to be viewed. Coroners cited the rule, suggesting that jurors were aware of it, and therefore that they were likely to consider movement an especially important factor. Jurists and judges cited the rule so frequently that they began to confuse it with the defini- tion of what a deodand was. By the 19th century, it was the definition of a deodand as far as the courts were concerned.89 Taken in isolation, the omnia quae movent rule creates the impression that ancient deodand law was anthropomorphic because movement suggests some sort of volition. Thus, the jurists' creation and perpetuation of the omnia quae movent rule fed into an erroneous notion about ancient juries-that they blindly ascribed free will to horses, carriages, and spoons. The "Under 14" Rule We have already seen that stationary objects could be deodands. But there was no maxim to explain which ones were deodands and which ones 86.

Sir Matthew Hale, writing a century after Coke, wrote specifi- cally about deodands which "though they are quiescentia, yet occasion the ... death."90 But Hale could not explain what it meant for a "quiescent" object to be the occasion of a party's death. Instead, he gave examples from the case-law. If a man falls into a pit, the township may be charged a "deodand" if the pit is not stopped up before the next eyre or goal deliv- ery. If a man falls from a hay-rick, the hay shall be forfeited. If a man "be getting up a cart by the wheel to gather plums, and neither the cart nor the horses are moving, the wheel shall be a deodand, but not the cart and horses."91 Perhaps Hale could have defined the deodand as: "Omnia quae movent ad mortem ... plus, anything you fall off of'. But Hale had access to a comparatively large number of coroners' enrollments and must have discerned that many cases would contradict such a rule-people often fell off of objects and died, yet no deodand was found.92 Hale's discomfort is almost palpable. "It seems," he hesitates, "that if a man be under the age of 14 years, and falls from a cart or horse, it shall not be a deodand . .. but if a horse, bull or the like kills him, or if a cart runs over him, there it shall be a deodand"93 In other words, in cases where the victim is under 14 years of age, a deodand may be levied only if its movement was the cause of the accident, not if it quiescently occa- sioned the death. Queasily, Hale cited Staunford as his authority. Staunford himself did not cite any authority for his contention that no deodand is due for victims under fourteen. I have not found any authority he could have cited; possibly, no such authority exists. More significant, I have not been able to locate a single document suggesting that 16th century coroners' juries, or any of the juries that came before them, had ever heard of, much less applied, this seemingly nonsensical rule. Where, then, did it come from? The circumstantial evidence suggests that Staunford inadvertently invented it. We know that Staunford had access to coroner's rolls and plea rolls. We've seen that similar factual predicates often yielded different, even contradictory, results. Staunford aspired to set forth clear-cut rules, but no such rules existed. Either he had to admit that deodands were levied in an ad hoc manner, or he had to discern a rule that explained the contradictions away. Why didn't Staunford admit, either directly or indirectly (that is, by omitting the whole discussion), that deodand determinations were not the products of legal algorithms? After all, there are various sensible explana- tions for the ad-hoc manner in which juries worked. To give just one 90. Hale, Sir Matthew, Historia Placitorum coronae (1736) (London: E.

Children were especially likely to be injured at or near their own houses, often by means of their parents' prop- erty. Perhaps juries undervalued deodands in these types of cases to spare a parent who had lost a child. In one Sussex case from the 16th century, a man was driving a wagon piled high with timber; Thomas, aged 10, was perched atop the pile. He slipped and fell but did not immediately perish; the jury specifically noted that he died before his father's eyes. They did not levy a deodand, and even took some pains to justify their decision: the "seid oxen" were not at fault ".... for they dyd as moche as in theym laye to hold backward," the coroner wrote. The reasons that Staunford never engaged in this sort of speculation is that it is at odds with Staunford's purpose in writing his book. Staunford was looking for clarity, for clear-cut rules. And, like many people who cannot find what they are looking for, Staunford seized on the next closest thing-a "latent" rule he thought he saw. After all, if it existed, the "under 14" rule would explain why juries levied deodands in some cases where people fell off of carts and horses, but not in others. Judging from the published sources there is no evidence that Staunford's "under 14" rule was ever applied. We have already seen that juries frequently levied deodands in cases where children fell into vats of boiling water. There were also cases where children were crushed by falling objects and mauled by animals, yet no deodands were found. Umfreville, the author of an 18th century legal treatise and a former coro- ner (in other words, the only commentator on deodands law with first- hand knowledge of how it worked), implied that the "under 14 rule" was a sham, though he felt compelled to repeat it. He introduced the rule with the words, "it seems . . ." He then gave a case pro and several cases con- tra, and left the reader to draw his own conclusions about the discrepancy between theory and real life.94 Once enough lawyers had repeated the "under 14" rule, however, it attained the status of a customary law as far as legal academics were con- cerned. Hale, Blackstone, and other jurists found the rule confusing, but instead of questioning its legitimacy, they attempted to find some sort of justification. Hale wrote that a child's "not of discretion to look to him- self," darkly hinting that children themselves are to blame for certain acci- dents.95 William Blackstone rejected this explanation, claiming that "the true ground of this rule seems rather to have been, that the child, by rea- son of its want of discretion, was presumed incapable of actual sin, and therefore needed no deodand to purchase propitiary masses."96 As a result, their treatises perpetuated the stereotype that deodand law was 94.

A typical 17th-century court compared the "under 14" rule to outdated rules such as those that "oblige[d] a sorcerer to con- jure no more," or those requiring an executioner to "cut off the first joint of a cut-purse's thumb."97 Again, the interpreters, not the practitioners, determined how common law was viewed. Fixtures Are Not Deodands A fixture is any personal property, attached to the land or a building, that is regarded as an irremovable part of the real property, such as a fire- place built into a home. Historically, personal property becomes a fixture when it is physically fastened to or connected with the land or building and the fastening or connection was done to enhance the utility of the land or building. Briton explicitly identified "houses" (presumably including all fix- tures) as possible candidates for deodands and banes.98 Houses and parts of house continued to be identified as deodands for hundreds of years.99 Neither Cook, nor Hale nor Blackstone breathed a word about fixtures. When Umfreville was writing his treatise, however, in 1761, the notion that a fixture could not be a deodand was such an accepted rule of law that he incorporated it into his definition of the word "deodand."loo The fixture rule appeared for the first time in 1664 in Rex v Cross and Dabbin. In that case, a bell-ringer had accidentally hung himself from the bellrope.101 The issue was whether or not the crown could extract a deodand from the church. The jury said yes, but the court held no, pre- sumably for reasons having to do with the relationship between church and state. However, it appears the court felt the need to couch its decision in more abstract, theoretical terms. Thus, it held that the bell, "being fixed, is no deodand; contra if by falling it had killed any, for then it's a chattel, as milstone falling from the mill."102 The court in Regina v. Wheeler generously extended this reasoning, holding that "the wheel of a forge or mill cannot be deodand, for, being fixed to the freehold, it cannot 97. Id. 98. Reprinted in E.

Umfreville defines the deodand as "res deo data," or "feodum clericale," ... must arise from a death by Misadventure, and is when a moveable thing not fixed to the freehold ... or instrument inanimate, or beast animate, doth upon the land, or in fresh water, (not the sea) by mischance cause the untimely death of a man over the Age of 14 years ... within the year and day." Id. p. 92. 101. Rex v Cross and Dabin, 1 Keble 745, 83 ER 12 (1664). The circumstances surround- ing the case are, to say the least, suspicious. How does one hang oneself accidentally? Perhaps the jury had been reluctant to make a finding of felo de se, which was considered a felony and would have led to the forfeiture of all the bell-ringer's worldly goods. 102. Id.

Even if "the owner of a mill take out one of the mill-stones to prick or gravel it, and devise the mill while the stone is severed from it, yet it shall pass as part of the mill."103 The courts eventually abandoned this pretext, holding that a bell can never be a deodand "because a bell is already given to God and to the church."104 This was identified in subsequent treatises as another rule of deodand law.105 In the meantime, the fixture rules somehow stuck. As with the "under 14" rule, there is no available evidence that juries ever thought about whether a given object was or was not a affixed to the freehold. And yet it was quoted in book after book. The rule sounds arbitrary when taken out of context, an effect that is exacerbated by the whimsical example inevitably given to illustrate the rule (the door, the gust of wind, the unfor- tunate bystander, brains). Was the example jurist-created, also? CONCLUSION The conventional wisdom about deodand law is that it was a pretex- tual tax, and any jury nullification that may be discerned in the case-law is simply proof that the confiscation of deodands provoked some sporadic resistance. The details of the case-law are irrelevant-merely colorful miscellany. I do not mean to entirely reject this view. I would like to make a couple of points, however. First, governments have many mechanisms at their disposal for taxing their citizenry. It is sig- nificant that this particular mechanism, rather than some other, endured for so many hundreds of years. One possible reason for the deodands's longevi- ty is its flexibility. The coroners' rolls from the 13th through the 18th cen- turies suggest that juries had ample discretion to tailor their findings to each individual case. It's also possible that people found deodands to be intrinsi- cally compelling. Something about the deodand may fulfill a basic human need to apportion blame, or satisfy our desire for symmetry and order-the same desire that drove the jurists to look for patterns and formulate rules. Second, it is significant that the miscellaneous rules of deodand law were made by jurists, and not by juries, as many people assume. How much of the common law was created in this manner? What do these rules tell us about the people who made them, and what does it tell us about the body of law we are still tinkering with today? Although we can only speculate about these matters, deodand law is an area where more vigorous speculation is long overdue. 103. Regina v Wheeler, 6 Modem 187, 87 ER 942 (1704). 104.
