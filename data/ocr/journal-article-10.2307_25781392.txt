<plain_text><page sequence="1">LIGHT STILL: The Dynamics of "the words that remain" Andrew Kennedy Beckett's dramatic dialogue creates still moments that have a spiritual force, even when the text is not semantically enriched by religious or affirmative imagery. On the contrary, the significant utterance of the speakers may emerge from agnostic, ambivalent or nihilistic texts, from moments of dying as much as from "moments of being". This amounts to an implicit mysticism or a rediscov ery of the 'negative way' for and within the stilled theatre. The article connects the existentially privileged moments with the hidden rhetoric of a simple lan guage, its attention-demanding performance, pacing and silences, in passages from the early plays. In the mystical tradition of the via negativa, 'the ground of being' can only be approached in silence, without naming IT, through avoidance of creeds, definitions and abstractions.1 Yet, the word 'mystic' has far too many theological or ineffable connotations, most of them a misnomer for those voices in Beckett's theatre which are my present subject. These voices, heard from time to time in the dialogue and between the lines, are fragments from a search for significance - the kind of significance that in the 'old style' was called 'spiritual'. There is a connection between the via negativa and a questing doubt, or doubting quest, concerning every ideology and mythology, including those central images of Christianity that keep being evoked in the dialogue of Beckett's plays - like the famous, indeterminate allusion to the Crucifixion: "one of the thieves was saved" - early on in Waiting for Godot. In the present context I want to point less to the explicit remnants of religious, predominantly Christian, mythology, and more to the voices in the dialogue that create moments of significance out of, or against, the dramatically enacted scenes of human chaos. In other words, I am look ing for the voices that may have a mystical undertone but are distinct from religious transcendence and symbolism. These voices are charged with human values of great intensity within agnostically ambivalent contexts. Such mystic implicitness may be associated with Simone 408</page><page sequence="2">Weil's concepts of "implicit love" in Waiting on God (Attente de Dieu) (see also Bryden, 128-29). In the Anglo-Irish literary tradition we find correspondences in what Joyce in Stephen Hero calls "epiphany", or "a sudden spiritual transformation", in Woolf s "moments of being" and, in a phrase that matches the doubleness of light seen in darkness, Eliot's "still point of the turning world" in Four Quartets (12).2 I am not in search of another theme; rather, I would like to discover how those still voices are made speakable and audible in the resistant materiality of the theatre. How is privileged time and space created for these voices? What makes them resonate and echo?3 Within the structure of an ambivalent quest in Waiting for Godot (a play perhaps over-discussed but not, I think, in the present context) there are moments of stillness and silence in which even the already reduced action is suspended to make way for reflection and inwardness. Such occasions can be read out of the text, and demand full attention in a performance that is attentively attuned to make the audience share these moments. After the opening silence, broken only by Estragon's panting as he is trying to take off his boot, the dialogue is quite energetic for a while, until we come to the pauses and hesitancy that mark the space for the one thief who was saved. There follow the almost monosyllabic, slow exchanges which direct attention to the tree, a silence not asked for by the stage direction but implicit in Vladimir and Estragon taking time to look at the tree before they speculate about the time and location of their pre sent situation. Then Estragon falls asleep for the first time and we have a kind of dream sequence with pianissimo dialogue, in the course of which Estragon makes a "gesture towards the universe" (stage direction) and rhetorically asks his companion: "This one [this dream] is enough for you?" (16). An unanswered and unanswerable question, but the ensuing silence gives us, the audience, a brief local occasion for pondering it. 'Energetic' exchanges often follow the 'still' voices, especially in the early plays: performing the dynamics, even the dialectics, of Beckett's dialogue. Thus, Gogo's sleep is followed by "the Englishman in the brothel" would-be story, by the wish to hang and so achieve an erection, and then by the entrance of Pozzo and Lucky. Moments of arrest occur throughout the play, from the silent listening for any sound or noise that might mark the coming of Godot - which turns out to be "the wind in the reeds" (19) - to the long silences that accompany the interrogation of the Boy at the end of Act I, repeated with variations at the end of Act II.4 The figure of the Boy has been deliberately reduced by Beckett to the minimum of symbolism - "no 409</page><page sequence="3">symbols where none intended" - and his language is child-like, including the anthropomorphic pseudo-divine attributes of the hidden Godot. Yet the dialogue commands total attention, suggesting a still possible, if illu sory, openness for release from suffering, reinforced by the tranquil pac ing and stillness in these closing scenes of interrogation. The still moments can be searching, attention-enhancing and even affirmative, as in the fine lyrical stichomythic duologue in Act II, self consciously invented by the waiting couple as a compensation for being "incapable of keeping silent":5 ESTRAGON: All the dead voices. VLADIMIR: They make a noise like wings. ESTRAGON: Like leaves. VLADIMIR: Like sand. ESTRAGON: Like leaves (62-63) This is followed by silence, followed by another silence. Then comes the second invocation of the dead - the quiet repetition is enough to give the word "dead" a resonance, like a muted bell: VLADIMIR: To be dead is not enough for them. ESTRAGON: It is not sufficient. Once again, this exchange is followed by silence, by two long silences, and two further silences: a verbal scoring aimed at achieving authentic speech (at the furthest move from the Shavian opera, more like a string duet heard in privacy). We may contrast these silences of depth with the mere time-killing silences of verbal games (e.g., "We could do our exer cises", II, 76). We may further contrast these voices, in terms of dramatic dialogue, with the silences of menace and psychological tension per fected in the plays of Pinter. On another level, one might not hear the force of the perhaps redeeming syllables in the torrent of Lucky's broken pseudo-intellectual, aphasiac speech: "the flames the tears the stones so blue so calm I resume alas alas [...] abandoned unfinished the skull" (44-45). 'Redeeming'? A less loaded term would be: 'regenerative'; the words seem to be carrying images for potential recovery for the speaker. And for the audience they emerge out of a chaos of broken words - these barely comprehensible words too must be listened to in the stilled theatre. They may be called "moments of being". 410</page><page sequence="4">Within the negating dialogue of Endgame, which embodies a virtual myth of anti-creation, one may look in vain for such moments of being. The moments turn into pointers to moments of dying as in Hamm's: "Moment upon moment, pattering down, like the millet grains of... (he hesitates) ... that old Greek, and all life long you wait for that to mount up to a life" (45). Here the image of the millet grains (which echoes Hamm's opening speech) has a nihilistic rather than a regenerative context. Silence itself, the silence that comes at or towards the end, has a negative finality, earlier in the same speech: "There I'll be, in the old shelter, alone against the silence and ... (he hesitates) ... the stillness." The silence is evoked in a kind of lament, bringing little release unless it is the sound of the words themselves. Semantically it is ambivalent (just as the pronoun 'against' is ambiguous, since it could mean both contra and as if 'leaning against'). Musically, the sonorous lyrical tonality, the slow rhythm - as well as the hypnotic repetition of the words 'silence' and 'stillness' - almost make us forget that the 'endgame' process con sists of moves towards annihilation. Are we experiencing the solace of a dirge? Near the end Clov's parting monologue is suffused with a kindred vision and language, as when he summons up, in an ironic and negating context, some of the existential keywords of our culture: "They said to me, That's love, yes, yes, not a doubt, now you see how [...] They said to me, That's friendship, yes, yes, no question, you've found it." After questioning our communal words for love and friendship, the resources of language itself are finally questioned and seen to be failing: "I ask the words that remain - sleeping, waking, morning, evening. They have nothing to say (50-51; emphasis added). Here we reach a paradox: "the words that remain" are saying something in the very moment when they are declared to be saying nothing. In part this is a matter of semantics: whereas abstract words like 'love' and 'friendship' are loaded with the cumulative burden of doubt and uncertainty (agnosticism) in our old and decaying culture, simple words like 'morning' and 'evening' are likely to survive even the apocalypse of language. More importantly, the words themselves - as spoken, as spaced and sounded within that quiet, atten tion-demanding monologue, like Hamlet's "To be or not to be" soliloquy - function as a linguistic and emotional counterpoint against the 'noth ingness' they assert. The reader/the audience can hardly proclaim at this point: "yes, yes, no question, these words say nothing." We remain silent or else ask: how is it possible to interrogate words? Whose words? Where do they have their being? - in the mind, in the dictionary, in our speech 411</page><page sequence="5">and conversation, in performance, on the printed page?, and so on. More probably, we are not inclined to ask such speculative questions; instead, we attend to the cadenced dialogue, reflecting on its negative yet stilled significance, and perhaps coming to reflect it directly, in purifying our own dialect. Beckett's text is not a dadaist text, yielding random aleatory or sound effects (a la Tristan Tzara or Kurt Schwitters), nor does it issue from a 'private language'.6 On the contrary, these fragments work communally in the theatre, tending towards communion. The audience response takes place in a concentrated and inward moment, set apart from mental and external distraction, but it is also a shared response. The cryptic and fragmented play language may have an impact like a secular-sacred text, or rather like a fallen liturgical text that commands inward attention, is intoned in a subtly cadenced voice but for minds fully awake. If that voice approaches the mystical dimension, then it has echoes of the internal darkness communicated by St John of the Cross pointing to nada, perpetual solitude, the 'self divested of the love of all created things, perhaps even the love of language. Let us call that an implicit mysticism. The privileged moments of the past re-played by old Krapp in Krapp 's Last Tape are simpler: the voices of memory come to us in a recognised line from Wordsworth's "The Prelude" XII, "there are in our existence spots of time / That [...] retain / A renovating virtue [...]", and Proust's involuntary memory in A la recherche du temps perdu. Thus Krapp obsessively focuses on the recording of his mother's death, the moment as experienced, when he could see the blind go down on his mother's window just as he happened to be throwing a ball to a little white dog. The voice quietly intones: "(Pause.) Moments. Her moments, my moments. (Pause.) The dog's moments. (Pause)" (15). Solemnity or sentimentality are avoided here, and the voice has reached a still point that is significant to the speaker. So is his one memory of love, as recorded in a later episode replaying the "farewell to love" in a punt afloat on a lake. Again, the simple language is given intensity by the careful spacing of an invocation: (Pause.) I asked her to look at me and after a few moments - (pause) - after a few moments she did, but the eyes just slits, because of the glare. I bent over her to get them in the shadow and they opened. (Pause. Low) Let me in. (Pause) (17) 412</page><page sequence="6">The spiritualising of a love idyll approaches erotic mysticism, which has been with us since The Song of Solomon. Here it is a voice without ecstasy. It reaches the reader/audience through a stillness that allows the humble, mostly monosyllabic Anglo-Saxon words, spoken by a low voice, to resonate in the silence. That enveloping silence is created by the pauses between the first extract and the fuller version of the episode, as Krapp achieves total concentration in listening to one treasured memory. (The passage quoted above is not included in the preliminary playing of an extract from the same tape). Then the final silence of the final replay, with Krapp motionless and the tape running on, deepens the effect on the stilled audience, transforming a private miniature memory into a commu nicated experience, and the minimal "words that remain" into the tran quilised dynamics of Beckett's evolving theatre language. My conclusion is implicit in the argument. Out of the silence, voices arise that are endowed with existential, I would say spiritual, force and significance - with something of the biblical "still small voice" about them. ("And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice" through which God appeared to Elijah, 1 Kings 19:12). The almost total exclusion of the multiplicity of the external world - 'the chaos' - contributes to creating significant moments, in contrast to the often stridently anti-essentialist texts of the postmodern era (see Kennedy 1997). Metaphorically, the moments are like subdued rays of light in darkness, even though we are asked to attend to felt loss and dying. Dramaturgically, in exploiting the power of "the words that remain" within subtle textures of verbal scoring, these voices from the early plays foreshadow the radical experimentation with dra matic language in the monological late plays. Notes 1. I was among the first critics - though I am not alone, witness the work of Marius Buning - who pointed to the via negativa in modern theatre. I have introduced this topic in Kennedy, 1975, 124 (on Eliot) and 135, n. 13 (linking the via negativa with the 'failure of language' as a myth for creation). 2. I am working on a book with the provisional title Agnostic and Modern where these ideas are fully discussed. The 'mystical' context was also presented in my guest lecture at Trinity College Dublin (March 1988), "Samuel Beckett and Agnosticism" and in "Beckett - Fragments of a Religious Vision", paper read at the Centre for the Study of Literature and 413</page><page sequence="7">Religion, University of Glasgow (September 1992) and published in Kennedy 1994. 3. The philosophical context, including certain affinities with the thought of Jacques Derrida, is too wide-ranging for the present discussion. 4. In the revised text of Waiting for Godot, Beckett added a "Long silence" at the very beginning preceding Estragon's struggle with his boot (1993, 9). As described in the textual notes on the 1975 Schiller-Theater Godot directed by Beckett, this silence was "the first of twelve Wartestellen (literally 'waiting points') - 'moments of stillness' or 'frozen waiting' moments, as Beckett referred to them. [...] He considered those at the beginning and the end of each act as one interrelated set and the four others within the action of each act as other sets" (McMillan and Knowlson, 91). 5. It should be recalled that it was Martin Esslin (60-61) who first drew attention to this kind of dialogue. 6. Wittgenstein denied the possibility of a 'private language'. I discussed this question in the philosophy of language in Kennedy, 1975, 136, n. 1.
