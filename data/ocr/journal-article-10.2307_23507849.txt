<plain_text><page sequence="1">David's Eschatological Psalter 11Q Psalmsa BEN ZION WACHOLDER Hebrew Hebrew Union College—Jewish Institute of Religion Cincinnati, Ohio in 1965 James A. Sanders published the editio princeps of 11Q Psalms". This text has aroused great interest because of its unusual arrangement and con tents. The order of the "canonical" Psalms found in 11Q Psalms" diverges sharply from the sequence attested in the Hebrew Bible. In addition, scat tered among these Psalms are a number of non-canonical compositions, some of which were unknown before the scroll's discovery. 11Q Psalms" also fea tures a sensational prose note extolling David's prophetic vision and crediting that monarch with the authorship of 4050 hymnic compositions. What accounts for the unusual arrangement and content of 11Q Psalms"? Sanders suggested that the scroll reflects an era when the components and sequence of the Massoretic Psalter were still in flux. Others have argued that the scroll should instead be viewed as a liturgical composition. The present study interprets the document in light of the prose note mentioned above. The reference to "David" is understood to be an allusion to the eschatological descendant of Jesse expected at the End of Days. The noncanonical com ponents of 11Q Psalms" and the divergent sequence of Psalms are carefully examined in light of the eschatological thought of the Qumran sect and the history of Jewish liturgy. The caves of the wilderness of Judaea have preserved the remains of numerous manuscripts of the biblical Book of Psalms.1 With some exceptions, these scrolls exhibit the traditional order and text of the Massoretic Book of Psalms. Among the exceptional Psalm scrolls is the remarkable 11Q Psalms3 manuscript published by J. A. Sanders in 19652 POSTSCRIPT — I wish to express my profound gratitude to James A. Sanders for his comments upon an earlier draft of this essay, and to John C. Reeves for his invaluable assistance in the composition of this paper. I also wish to thank my daughter, Hannah Katsman, for her editorial assistance. The paper has also benefited from the general dis cussion during a meeting of the Hebrew Union College Faculty Forum where excerpts from it were initially presented. (1) See J.A.

The text, by and large traditional, contains some notable additions to the Massoretic corpus. It has the Hebrew texts, in two parts, for Psalm 151, a work hitherto known only from the Septuagint (and its dependent versions), and Psalms 154 and 155, which had survived only in Syriac. It also contains several apocryphal compositions either partially known — such as Ben Sira 51:13-19,30b — or previously un attested — such as an "Apostrophe to Zion," a "Plea for Deliverance," and the "Hymn to the Creator." The arrangement of the known Psalms diverges in many places from the traditional sequence of the Psalter. Finally, column 27 contains a prose accounting of David's literary ac tivity, attributing 4050 compositions to this king. Modern scholarship has attempted to account for the content and arrangement of this scroll. Sanders has presented a case for an "open" Psalter. Without denying the antiquity of the traditional Psalter, the modern editor argues that at Qumran, and perhaps elsewhere, the He brew canon was in a state of flux and was hence open to new compo sitions or arrangements other than that found in the traditional Book of Psalms.4 As late as the early decades of the Common Era, the Qumran Psalter could still include a variety of compositions presumably authored by David. Sanders argues that the existence of what later became the traditional canon of the Psalter did not preclude the compilation of di vergent and innovative "Psalters" among dissident groups. 11Q Psalms3 provides concrete evidence of this development. The view of Sanders has gained general acceptance, but there exists some strong dissent. Writing soon after the publication of the editio prin ceps,ceps, M.H. Goshen-Gottstein5 and S. Talmon6 independently raised the possibility that the scroll was not just a variant Psalter, but a liturgical compilation that employed psalms along with other hymnic composi Cave Cave 11 (11QPsa) (Oxford, 1965).

Talmon has gone so far as to suggest that 11Q Psalms3 is the oldest "Jewish prayerbook.'"7 The sharpest opposition to Sanders's hypothesis of a dynamic canon, however, came from P.W. Skehan.8 Skehan, to whom we owe many in sightful publications on the Qumran fragments of the canonical Psalter, argued that the Book of Psalms as we now have it (i.e., its fivefold di vision, 150 psalms, and their sequence) goes back to at least the period preceding the composition of the Book of Chronicles, as he suggests, circa circa 400 b.c.e. 9 Skehan supported his position by a meticulous exam ination of the Psalter fragments recovered from Qumran, En Gedi, and Masada. He then went on to study the content and arrangement of 11Q Psalms3, and concluded that the scroll represented a "library edition" of the works of David.10 The copyist culled sections from liturgical works and from the Book of Psalms and provided a notice regarding David's extraordinary literary productivity. No one, including its com piler, ever considered 11Q Psalms3 to be a rival Psalter. This library copy of liturgical texts communicates little about the origin and devel opment of the Hebrew Book of Psalms. The debate between Sanders and Skehan" has enriched our knowl edge and understanding not only of the scroll under consideration, but also of the problem of the history and development of the Hebrew Book of Psalms and of early Jewish liturgy. In their discussions, both Sanders and Skehan have drawn attention to a focal point that still needs clar ification. Ezra 3:10 and 1 Chronicles 16:7—36 make it abundantly clear that the authors of the Books of Ezra and Chronicles had before them collections of psalms that were attributed to David.12 What was the na ture of this postexilic Psalter?

Or were its boundaries more fluid, as asserted by Sanders? Both Sanders's and Skehan's treatments of the issue omit any allusion to the relevance of 11Q Psalms3 to the origins and evolution of Jewish liturgy. I refer in particular to the following liturgical compositions: hodu,hodu, which begin the synagogal morning prayers; the hallel (Psalms 113—118), recited at night during the Passover Seder and on the morn ings of the three pilgrim festivals; and the כashrey (Psalrn 84:5 + 144:15 + 145), a mainstay of the traditional prayer-book. The Jewish prayer book (and one might add its Karaite counterpart) consists of many layers of texts, some of which, one must suppose, go back to a postexilic Psalter. The use of the hodu is already attested in 1 Chronicles 16,3י and tes timony about the hallel can be recovered from the Chronicler, 1 Mac cabees, and the Mishnah.'4 I submit that 11Q Psalms3 enriches our knowledge about the origin and development of these prayers as well as testifying to an early conception of the Psalter. Whether the liturgical elements contained in 11Q Psalms3 reflect the conceptions of later rab binic Judaism or of the Qumran sect remains an open question. If forced to choose between these alternatives, I am inclined to view it as sectarian. The Prehistory of Psalmic Liturgy I believe that conceptually at least the Song at the Sea (shirat hayam, Exodus 15:1—18) constitutes what may be labelled the "proto-psalm.'"5 The proem . . . אז ישיר משה ובני ישראל את השירה הזאת (Ex 15:1) ascribes it to both Moses and the Israelites, but the line immediately following, אשירה לשם (Ex 15:2a), employs the first person singular mode of address, indicating that the ascription was primarily to Moses. Exodus 15:20-21 relates another proem describing the actions of Miriam, concluding with ותען להם מרים שירו ליי כי גאה גאה סוס ורכבו רמה בים (Ex 15:21). A comparison of verses 2a and 21 shows that the first person singular and second per (13) Cf.

Some primary points contained within the Song are pertinent for ex plaining my conception of the "proto-psalm." These are: a. a clear depiction of divine miracles (vv. 1,4,6,8,10—12). b. glorification of God's acts of creation (vv. 16-17). c. proclamation of God's salvific acts on behalf of Israel (vv.4,13, 14-16). d. exaltation of the majesty and glory of God (vv.1,2,6,7,11,18). e. presaging of Israel's entry into Canaan and the building of the sanctuary (vv.13,17). f. depiction of God as everlasting king (v. 18). What has been said so far indicates that both the formulary intro ductions and the content of the Mosaic Song at the Sea might have served as prototypes for certain psalmic compositions. One might note that the last third of the Hebrew Psalter incorporates in its superscrip dons technical terminology reminiscent of the Song at the Sea. These include shir,16 shir mizmor,11 shiru,18 and נashirah,9י and synonyms such as tehillah2" and נazammerah.2' In fact, the rabbinic Sages ascribe to Moses authorship of some unattributed psalms.22 The Hebrew Psalter itself contains only a single alleged Mosaic composition — Psalm 90. A frag mentary text belonging to the group 4Q381 (24 4—11) also preserves an additional noncanonical tefillah which might be ascribed to Moses.23 What has been suggested so far is strictly speculative; I am only at tempting to show, for the moment, that there is an underlying concep tual structure to the thanksgiving songs of the Hebrew Scriptures. The chronology of these ancient songs remains so hopelessly obscure that one could argue that the Mosaic Song at the Sea received its structure (16) Psalm 120:1; 121:1; 122:1; 123:1; 124:1; 125:1; 126:1; 127:1; 128:1; 129:1, 130:1; 131:1; 132:1; 133:1; 134:1; 149:1; and cf. 137:3; 144:9.

This possibility, however, seems unlikely,24 because, as was men tioned above, tradition does assign psalms to Moses. The compilation of the Psalter as a whole, however, is unanimously accorded to David.5'־ What is the oldest statement that we can find that attributes Psalms to this monarch? Biblical scholars usually cite several significant passages from the Books of Ezra-Nehemiah and Chronicles to bear witness to this theme.26 Another biblical text often invoked is 2 Samuel 22:1—23:7, to which I shall return later. But perhaps the most crucial text for this conception, and as far as I know ignored in this connection, is chapters 11 and 12 of the prophet Isaiah. Isaiah 11:1—g announces the appearance of "a shoot from the root of Jesse"27 upon whom God will bestow the divine spirit of wisdom, un derstanding, and power, and who will lead humankind into a type of Golden Age wherein the knowledge of the ways of God would fill the earth like "the waters of the sea." The prophet foresees an era of justice and peace taking effect even among the wild beasts. Verses 10—16 go on to apply this new situation to the world of international politics, and foresees the spread of peace throughout the troubled world. The new era of well-being will climax with the reunion of all the scattered segments of the people of Israel. Judah and Ephraim will be reunited, and there will be a vast ingathering of the exiles from Edom, Ammon, Moab, and Philistia. Significantly, this process is compared to the earlier Egyptian exodus: "And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people ... as it was on the day of Israel's coming forth from Egypt" (Isa 11:16). Having evoked memories of the Exodus in the latter portion of chap ter 11, the succeeding chapter now goes on to echo the Song at the Sea. Isaiah 12:1-2 reads: ואמרת ביום ההוא אודך יי כי אנפת בי ישב אפך ותנחמני הנה אל ישועתי אבטח ולא אפחד כי עזי וזמרת יה יי ויהי לי לישועה.

Isaiah 12:1—2 apparently means to say that on that great future day of redemption, the people would sing the Song at the Sea once again, but this time with greater power. The proph et replaces the נashirah (or shiru) with codkha, "I will extol thee . . ." In contrast to the fear that marked the initial events of the first Exodus, Isaiah emphasizes the total absence of fear that would characterize the future redemption (Isa 12:2a). Verse 3 ("you shall draw water with joy from the wells of salvation") depicts a greater glory awaiting Israel in the end of days. These future wonders, which will exceed the miracle at the Red Sea, invoke from Israel a second response: . . . הודו ליי קראו בשמו הודיעו בעמים עלילתיו (verse 4a)• As in verse 1 hodu replaces the shiru of Exodus 15. It seems that whereas נashirah and shiru are words proper for the past, codkha and hodu belong to the realm of future deliverance. From a literal point of view, the songs recited in Isaiah 12 are as sociated with the felicitous presence of a descendant of Jesse but not necessarily David himself. The passage never mentions his name. The author of 1 Chronicles 16:7-8, when citing the line הודו ליי קראו בשמו הודיעו בעמים עלילתיו (verse 8), nevertheless ascribes it to David (verse 7) and gives as its setting the time when the Ark was brought into Jeru salem. Of course this author draws only indirectly from Isaiah 12:4; the source of the quote is actually Psalm 105:1, as made clear from the re mainder of the passage in the Chronicler. It is not clear whether the composer of Psalm 105 drew upon Isaiah 12 for this line or if Psalm 105 was known to the author of Isaiah 12.28 However this is resolved, it seems likely that in postexilic times, or even earlier, Psalm 105 with the initial line as we have it was ascribed to David, and this line (hodu . . .) would introduce the new Song of Thanksgiving at the end of days when the second (cf. shenit Isa 11:11) deliverance would take place. This eschatological coloring may explain the construction of the liturgical pie ces in 1 Chronicles 16, when after the hodu of verses 8—22 a poetic pas sage occurs that is very similar to Psalm 96. 1 Chronicles 16:23 begins: שירו ליי כל הארץ, reproducing Psalm 96:1b, but the preceding portion of the verse should be noted: שירו ליי שיר חדש (Ps 96:1a). The epithet hadash when applied to shir invites a comparison with the "old" Song at the Sea. Eschatology may also explain why 1 Chronicles 16 concludes its liturgical portion with Psalm 106:47—48. These lines serve to close the fourth division of the canonical Book of Psalms, and appear to have (28) See the discussions of G.B.

What has been said so far, if cogent, may help to offer clues to per plexing questions in the field of Jewish liturgy. For example, the morn ing prayer service (shaharith) features the hodu Psalm, but in the recen sion as given in 1 Chronicles 16:8—36. This is a practice attested from the Middle Ages,29 and this hodu is also employed in the Sephardic rite in connection with the Qorbanot.3° Why, of all the choices available, was this composition employed in such a way? There are similar questions concerning the origin of the hallel. Ezra-Nehemiah and Chronicles re peatedly employ the verb root hll in several interesting nominal and ver bal formations such as in the formula lehodot ulehallel.31 This clause is all too often obscured by the English rendition of "to thank and to ex toi." It actually seems to signify "to recite the hodu and the hallel."*2 How ever, if the Chronicler knows of a hallel, does it necessarily follow that this hallel is identical with the one prescribed in the Mishnah and trans mitted in the Jewish prayer book? Certain scholars, it will be recalled, have argued that the hallel found in the synagogal liturgy and prescribed in the Mishnah dates from the Second Temple period.33 This hallel consists of an introductory blessing and Psalms 113—118. Psalm 113 begins and ends with the invocation hallelujah hallelujah and employs several forms of the root hll throughout its nine verses. Psalm 114, immediately following, is devoted to the miracle at the Reed Sea. Psalms 115 and 116 each conclude their phrase of God with a hallelujah, but Psalms 117-118 seem to be the real core of the hallel.hallel. The hallelu line of Psalm 117 serves as an appropriate introduction to the praise of Psalm 118. Both the opening and concluding verses of Psalm 118 recite the famous liturgical line הודו ליי כי טוב כי לעולם חסדו fea tured so prominently in the Chronicler, but which is perhaps most fa miliar from its employment in the so-called hallel hagadol or Psalm 136.34 There are no specific references to the Exodus events in Psalm 118, (2g) I.

For example, verse 5 ... מן המצר קראתי יה suggests a possible word-play on the Hebrew name for Egypt (misrayim) and might thus be interpreted in a dual sense. Verse 14, עזי וזמרת יה ויהי לי לישועה, is an explicit allusion to the Song at the Sea and to Isaiah 12. The expression ימין יי עשה חיל (verse 15b; also verse 16) echoes Exodus 15:6,12: ימינך יי נאדרי בכת ימינך יי תרעץ אויב and נטית ימינך תבלעמו ארץ. Especially reminiscent of Isaiah 12 is the use of the for mulaic codkha, as in verse 21: אודך בי עניתני ותהי לי לישועה and in verse 28: אלי אתה ואודך אלהי ארוממך. Students of Jewish liturgy have attempted to explain the position ac corded the hallel in worship on the basis of the allusions to the Temple service found therein.35 There is probably some truth to this assump tion, but our study is beginning to accumulate evidence that the hallel is associated with a plea for a "second redemption" envisioned with a descendant of Jesse as leader. The synagogal hallel makes no allusion to David, but in the early stages of Jewish liturgy, the association with David seems to be paramount; many Psalms are attributed to him in the Hebrew Psalter. Isaiah 11-12 reveal that a descendant of Jesse was expected to lead all Israel in a new song of deliverance. According to the Chronicler's reconstruction of Israelite history, the "Davidic" hodu and hallel were sung at the time of the investiture of the Ark in the city of Zion. It is not only the Chronicler who is familiar with the redemptive songs of David. The Deuteronomistic historian(s) employs a similar tradition in recording what may be the earliest reference to the Davidic compo sition of the Psalter. This tradition is found in 2 Samuel 22:1—23:7, which begins with a thanksgiving to God by David for his deliverance from the power of his enemies and from Saul (2 Sam 22:1 = Psalm 18:1). The song proper concludes: על כן אודך יי בגוים ולשמר אזמר מגדיל 2) ישועות מלכו ועשה לחסד למשיחו לדוד ולזרעו עד עולם Sam 22:50-51 = Psalm 18:50-51). The presence of the terms codkha and נazammer in verse 50 may be the points of origin for the later termini technici of hodu "thanks giving," and mizmor "song" or Greek psalmos . This passage may be the ultimate source from whence Isaiah 12 derived its connection of codkha and the descendant of Jesse. The final postscript of verse 51 explicitly acknowledges the enthronement of David by God as His anointed king for eternity. This becomes even clearer in the passage immediately fol lowing, 2 Samuel 23:1-7: ואלה דברי דוד האחרנים נאם דוד בן ישי ונאם הגבר הקם (35) Zeitlin, JQR 53(1962-63)24-26.</page><page sequence="10">32 BEN ZION WACHOLDER [10] על משיח אלהי יעקב ונעים זמרות ישראל (verse 1). The precise meaning of the line is difficult to extract, but its assertion of David as both the anointed one of the God of Jacob and as an accomplished liturgist is clear. The sense ofנaharonim is somewhat obscure. The Targum provides the most attractive explanation, interpreting dawid נaharonim as the "latter-day David," the David that is prophesied to come at the end of days.36 This passage also draws upon the introduction to Balaam's vision in Numbers 24, where we read: וישא משלו ויאמר נאם בלעם בנו בער ונאם הגבר שתם העין . . . (Num 24:3)• This linkage appears to suggest that David ben Jesse was the prophetic equal or even superior to Balaam the Gentile seer. The punning of ne^um and necim (2 Samuel 23:1) draws an even closer connection between prophecy and psalmody. The remainder of the Da vidic composition, when viewed as a whole, seems to be a rephrasing of Balaam's vision as well as a poem exalting David's power with words. 11Q Psalms a Before analyzing the psalmic content of 11Q Psalms3, it is necessary to glance at an important and highly interesting prosaic composition contained within this scroll. It consists of a citation of 2 Samuel 23:7, immediately followed by a lengthy prose note regarding David and his literary activity (Column 27:1-11). As this occurs at the top of a page, we must infer with Sanders that the bottom portion of the preceding column contained 2 Samuel 23:1—6,37 which begins with a phrase dis cussed above, ואלה דברי דוד האחרנים. The Qumran scribe must have un derstood the clause "and these are the last words of David" as referring to the text of the scroll as a whole, and therefore considered the content of of 11Q Psalms3 to be Davidic.38 The prose note immediately following the quote from 2 Samuel appears to function as a type of pesher to the "last words of David." . . . ישי חכם p ויהי דויד "and David ben Jesse was a wise man . . . ." The mention of the patronymic "Jesse" — found also in Isaiah 11:1, 2 Sam uel 23:1, and Psalm 151A — was understood to refer not to the historical (36) Targum 2 Samuel 23:1: ואלין פתגמי נבואת דויד דאתנבי לסוף עלמא ליומי נחמתא דעתידין למיתי אמר דויד בר ישי ואימר גברא דמרבא למלכו משיח במימר אלהיר דיעקב ותקין לממני בחייך בסים תשבחתיה דישראל ("And these are the words of the prophecy of David that he prophesied for the end of the world, for the aeon of the future consolation. The saying of David the son of Jesse and the utterance of the man destined for kingship, anointed by the word of the God of Jacob; and he prepared with (his) palate a listing of the fragrant praises of Israel").

One might recall the description of Enoch as sephar parshaP in the Aramaic fragments of 1 Enoch from Qumran,44 and the continuation of our text seems to am plify the scope of the word sopher. .. . . ונבון ותמים בכול דרכיו לפני אל ואנשים "and discerning and perfect in all his ways before God and men."45 The term nabon appears to antic ipate what is expounded at greater length in the next clause. Perhaps nabon nabon should be understood as forming a hendiadys with sopher, pro ducing a meaning such as "a discerning scribe." The latter part of this clause rewords 2 Samuel 23:3b: מושל באדם צדיק מושל יראת אלהים. The pur pose of this clause is to further define the sobriquet סופר ונבון "scribe and man of understanding" (see also Targum to 2 Samuel 23:3),46 so as to distinguish the scribal role of David from that of the secular scribe employed in producing profane writings. . . . ויתן לו יי רוח נבונה ואורה "and God gave him a spirit of inspiration and illumination . . . ." The writer is apparently fusing the description of the Davidic descendant contained in Isaiah 11:2 (ונחה עליו רוח יי 47(רוח חכמה ובינה רוח עצה וגבורה רוח דעת ויראת יי with the light imagery of 2 Samuel 23:4 (. . . וכאור בקר יזרח שמש) and the יראת יי of verse 5. This apparent reliance upon Isaiah 11 confirms my inclination to view the verbs which supposedly describe attributes of the historical David as in fact connoting the qualities that will characterize the eschatological re deemer figure. The rare appellation "David ben Jesse" (or what amounts to the same, "ben Jesse") is often applied to eschatological con texts (Isaiah 11:1, 2 Samuel 23:1, 11Q Psalms3 27:2; Psalm 151 A?).48 (44) 4QEnGiantsa 8 4; 4QEnGiantsb ii 14; 4QEne 2 2 (?). For these texts see J.T. Milik, The The Books of Enoch: Aramaic Fragments of Qumrân Cave 4 (Oxford, 1976). (45) Following the translation of Sanders, DJD IV, 92; idem, Cornell, 137.

For a different translation, see Harrington-Saldarini (cf. n.36 above). (47) Sanders DJD IV, 93. (48) The use of the patronymic "ben Jesse" should be remarked on. The employment of patronymics when not needed for identification adds an abstract, even eschatological flavor to passages in which they occur. Thus Isaiah 11:1 dispenses with the name "David" when predicting the appearance of an eventual deliverer. The use of the phrase "David ben Jesse" in 2 Samuel 23:1 suggests the special sense of a promised leader who will com pose new songs of praise that extol the final deliverance. It is not inconceivable that the use of the patronymic in Psalm 151A (see below) refers to David's role at the End of Days. I would like to suggest that the designation "David ben Jesse" and in particular the phrase "ben Jesse" is equivalent to the messianic designations gezacyishay, shoresh yishay,</page><page sequence="13">[13] david's eschatological psalter 35 The Targum to 2 Samuel 23:1—7 interprets this entire passage as re ferring to the messianic era. The use of motifs from Isaiah 11 only lends additional support to this hypothesis. My hypothesis that the historical and the eschatological "Davids" have become amalgamated in this prose note helps to clarify the problematic enumeration of David's compositions contained in the remainder of this note (27:4-11). The list begins:. . . ויכתוב תהלים שלושת אלפים ושש מאות "and he wrote 3600 tehillim . . . ." Unlike the remainder of the sums which follow, the number 3600 has no obvious rationale. One explanation might be that the number was predetermined; that is to say, the number 3600 was required to add up with the remainder to reach the goal of 4050 compositions. A better reason, however, might involve the use of gematria.gematria. Skehan has already called attention to the fact that the large numerals contained in 11Q Psalms3 27:2-11 are multiples of 150; i.e., the total number of the psalms contained in the Massoretic canon.49 3600 thus is the product of 150 X 24. But from where does this number 24 stem? Now the name "David" (dawid), which normally possesses the numerical value of 14, is written maPe in both the Qumranic Psalms scroll and the Books of Chronicles, as opposed to the baser spelling em ployed in the Massoretic version of the Book of Psalms. The additional yodyod adds the value of 10 to the normal value of 14 for David, thus pro ducing our 24. Our author may be implying that David will have com posed (by the end of days) 24 books of tehillim, each containing 150 psalms. Other explanations for the number 24 might involve the tra ditional number of the priestly courses allegedly established by David (according to 1 Chronicles 24:1-18)5° or the traditional number of ca nonical books assigned to the Hebrew canon. This one book of 3600 or alternatively 24 books of 150 psalms might legitimately be designated a tehillim hagadol or rabbati, which would conceivably accommodate com positions like those found in the noncanonical psalms scrolls stemming from Qumran (4Q380-381) or the apocryphal Syriac psalms. This total does not necessarily reflect the actual existence of a psalter 24 times semah,semah., and ben daioid.

The separation of the shirim from the 3600 tehillim imply that they were distinct from the compositions that made up the so-called tehillim rabbati.5a The reason for this distinction is unclear. The tehillim formed part of a magnum opus ; the shirim were part of a performed liturgy. This difference, according to the account, goes back to David himself. Does this imply that psalms from the tehillim could not be used in the liturgy? One hardly thinks so; rather, it suggests that David composed specific songs for each sac rificial occasion. David's musical talent is already remarked in the Deu teronomistic tradition, the traditional Book of Psalms, and the Chron icier, and receives special commendation in Psalm 151A which follows this prose note on the next column of 11Q Psalms3. A further question is raised by the apparent differentiation between tehillim tehillim and shirim. Of which category is the manuscript 11Q Psalms3 con sidered an example? The answer to this question depends upon the def inition of shir by the author of 11Q Psalms3. According to Mishnah Tamid 7:4, a shir was a single psalm sung by the Levites during the Tern pie service.53 The shirim enumerated there are all from the canonical text of the Book of Psalms (Psalms 24; 48; 82; 94; 81; 93; 92). The dif ferentiation of shirim from tehillim by our author, however, would seem to suggest that he had a divergent understanding of this relationship. The Mishnah also occasionally speaks as if there were a distinction be (51) It has been suggested to me that the number 3600 may have arisen from the Mesopotamian practice of using 60 as a base numeral; thus 3600 = 60 x 60. This solution however cannot explain the presence of the other numbers (e.g., 4050) in the prose note. Flusser-Safrai consider the number 3600 "fantastic", but they also suggest that this total may once have been actually executed by scribes in antiquity ("Shirey Dawid", 101). Skehan's suggestion of the importance of 150 for the author of this prose note seems the most plausible explanation. (52) "The distinction between psalm and song and the latter's application to cultic usage will evoke considerable form-critical interest." (Sanders, DJD IV, 91). See also P.J. Kobelski, Melchizedek and Melchiresac (Washington, 1981), 16-17. R-T. Beckwith argues that tehillah and shir are synonymous and that they do not imply two distinct compositional categories. This argument however ignores the plain meaning of the text at this point in the note. See Beckwith, RQ 11(1982-84)506. (53) M. Tamid 7:4: . . . השיר שהיו הלוים אומרים במקדש (followed by their enumeration). See also Seder Rav Amram 14a. Beckwith (RQ 11(1982—84)500-501) can find no con nection between the contents of these Psalms and their respective days of recitation. Note however the manuscript tosefet to M. Tamid 7:4 reproduced by Ch. Albeck in his note to this mishnah in his Shishah Sidrey Mishnah (Jerusalem &amp; Tel Aviv, 1952-59).</page><page sequence="15">[15] david's eschatological psalter 37 tween the two categories, as in Mishnah Rosh Hashanah 4:4: "Once the witnesses (for the new moon) tarried so long that the Levites were dis ordered in their singing . . . ."54 It seems unlikely that a writer whose Psalter could embrace 3600 tehillim would have been satisfied with a sin gle psalm for the sacrificial shir. I have no final resolution to this prob lem, so I now revert to the author's enumeration of the shirim. ושיר לשורר לפני המזבח על עולת התמיד לכול יום ויום לכול ימי השנה ארבעה וששים ושלוש מאות "and songs to sing before the altar over the tamid-offering daily, for all the days of the year, 364" ולקורבן השבתות שנים וחמשים שיר... "and for the Sabbath-offerings, 52 songs" ...ולקרבן ראשי החודשים ולכול ימי המועדות וליום הכפורים שלושים שיר "and for the new moon-offerings and for all the festival days and the Day of Atonement, 30 songs." The author now proceeds to total these figures: ויהי כול השיר אשר דבר ששה וא[ר]בעים וארבע מאות "and all the songs that he uttered were 446" (364 + 54 + 30). He then appends an additional four shirim ושיר לנגן על הפגועים ארבעה to arrive at the final figure of 4050 (. . . ויהי הכול ארבעת אלפים וחמשים). As almost everyone has pointed out, the assertion that the year con sists of 364 days makes this particular note, if not the whole scroll, a sectarian composition. Despite scholars such as A. Jaubert55 who have sought to demonstrate the antiquity of this particular reckoning, the first clear evidence that we have for a 364-day year appears in the so called Astronomical Enoch (1 Enoch 7 2-82 )56 and subsequently in the Book of Jubilees and at Qumran. The emphasis upon the phrase לכול יום ויום לכול ימי השנה draws attention to the sectarian enumeration57 and indirectly suggests that David himself also subscribed to the 364-day sys tern. Since, as we assume, the priests of the Second Temple adhered to a lunisolar calendar, it follows that the shirim prescribed for that Tern pie service are disharmonious with the shirim enjoined by the prose note. And since, as far as we know, the sect did not have a sanctuary of its own wherein the songs prescribed in this note could be sung at the altar, these 364 shirim must refer to the service that will be celebrated in the future Temple. This future Temple is probably identical with the struc ture and the ritual that are described in the so-called Temple-Scroll or 11Q Torah.58 (54) See also Seder Olam 30, another passage that demonstrates that there were special holiday shirim.

There is little reason to regard their silence on this point as dissent, since the linkage of psalmody to sacri ficial rites is frequently stressed in the books of Ezra and Chronicles and in the traditional Psalter. The composition of 52 shirim for each of the 52 Sabbaths of the year also agrees with the Qumranic Torah. This fixed number60 stands in contrast with the traditional lunisolar calendar, wherein the number of Sabbaths occurring annually varied. It should be noted that on the Sab bath both a tamid and a Sabbath-offering were sacrificed.61 The mention of 52 Sabbath shirim raises the question of the relationship between this statement and the numerous fragments of the Shirot cOlat Hashabbat, edited by C. Newsom.62 The surviving texts consist of a type of angelic yoseryoser which was recited during the first 13 Sabbaths of the year, and presumably the entire composition would have embraced all 52 weeks, despite Newsom's arguments to the contrary.63 Although the vocabulary and structure of the angelic shirot are reminiscent of psalmic composi dons, the heavenly setting of these hymns renders it questionable that our note has these compositions in mind.64 One might presume, nev ertheless, another sort of relationship between the 52 Davidic shirim and the heavenly shirot.

(60) Beckwith again errs when he disregards this number in his assignment of the Levitical courses (RQ 11[ 1982-84(505). How can he remove two Sabbaths from a 52-Sabbath year?

Support for this suggestion comes from the use of the term qorbanqorban in 11Q Psalmsa; the title of the other set of compositions specifies shirotshirotshirot colat. We might suppose that the 52 Sabbath shirim are prescriptive for the future Temple, as are the 364 daily shirim. The 30 shirim for new moons, festivals, and the Day of Atonement involve some ambiguity of interpretation, since it is unclear how the au thor wished to apportion them among the new moons and festive sea sons. Did the author mean to assign 12 shirim for each of the new moons, leaving a remainder of 18 for the festive seasons? Or did he recognize only one shir for the 12 new moons, leaving 29 for the remaining hoi idays? The second suggestion is more likely; that is, that there was a single shir for the 12 new moons, just as there was a single shir for the Day of Atonement.65 This leaves 28 shirim to be recited on those days when additional sacrifices were offered. But what days were these? The only document that preserves an exhaustive list of the sectarian holidays is 11Q Torah.66 Unfortunately, it is fragmentary in several crit ical passages, but the remains of several calendrical works recovered from Qumran can supplement it.67 Twenty-eight days can be identified with the help of this literature: First day of first month 1 Fourteenth day of first month 1 Feast of Unleavened Bread 7 Raising of the Timer 1 First-fruits of Grain 1 First-fruits of Wine 1 First-fruits of Oil 1 Wood-offering 6 First day of 7th month 1 Feast of Booths _8 28 If this reckoning is valid, it further indicates our author's dependence upon 11Q Torah. Following the festive songs, the note provides a subtotal of the shirim (65) The "new moons" and Day of Atonement are specifically singled out because they were apparently not counted among כול ימי המועדות. Flusser-Safrai assert that the mo'adot were the customary Jewish festivals and not the divergent sectarian celebrations listed in 11QT ("Shirey Dawid 100-101). Unfortunately, their assertion lacks the specificity necessary for evaluation. See my table below. (66) Notably 11QT 14:9-29:2. (67) See J.T.

This is an additional indication that the shirim belong to a category distinct from the 3600 tehillim, on the one hand, and the four shirim prescribed for the pegucim, on the other. This latter category is puzzling, for the word hapegucim is not attested elsewhere in Qumran literature. Sanders renders it as "the stricken."68 It has been suggested that these four extra shirim correspond to the four intercalated days of the 364-day calendar: the 31st day of the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth months.69 Jubilees 6:23 stresses the extraordi nary importance of these four days, but the placement of these four shirim shirim apart from the previously mentioned 364 shirim, and their exclu sion from the subtotal of 446, argues against such an explanation. Perhaps the clue to a solution lies in interpreting the clause as a whole. We read ושיר לנגן על הפגועים ארבעה. Although the term shir is employed repeatedly above, the purposive lenaggen is used only in connection with the pegucim. With the assumption that David is the author, it seems likely that this infinitive refers to David's performance upon the kinnor when he was engaged in soothing the afflicted Saul (see 1 Samuel 16:16,23).70 The rabbinic term pegacim 71 refers to evil spirits, or in modern parlance, mental illness, and appears to be an appropriate description of the dis turbed Saul. In 1g7i J.P.M. van der Ploeg published some fragments designated 11Q PsApa that he suggested may preserve remnants of the shir shir hapegucim.7!i This text apparently consisted of formulae for the ex orcism of evil spirits from the "afflicted" (peguaz). The fragmentary text concludes with the first verse of Psalm 91, a composition later invoked frequently in apotropaic contexts.73 The author of this prose note thus implies that these four songs were of the same type that David used to sing in the presence of Saul, or in other words, they were therapeutic for the mentally ill. As to why they were four in number, it seems nec essary to conjecture that this number was needed to fill out a round figure of 450 shirim. . . . ויהי הכול ארבעת אלפים וחמשים "and the grand total is 4050 . . . ."

The individual numbers of shirim (450) and tehillim (3600) are divisible by 150 as well. Thus we have (24 X 150) + (3 X 150) = 27 X 150 or 4050. It is interesting to note that 27 = 33, and indeed all of the numerals employed in the preceding equation are multiples of 3. The number 3 evidently had a special significance for this Qumran author. Could this be related to the threefold utterance of the seraphim before God as related in Isaiah 6 (qadosh, qadosh, qadosh . . .) or the three verses of the Priestly Blessing or the 73 interpretation of Isaiah 30:26? Jubilees 2:17—23 speaks of a threefold blessing of the Sabbath by God, the angels, and Israel. The prose note concludes: כול אלה דבר בנבואה אשר נתן לו מלפני העליון "all these he spoke by prophecy which had been given76 to him by the Most High." The phrase kol °eleh and the term benebxTah refer specifically to the 4050 compositions enumerated in this note. This suggests that the historical David could have uttered the eschatological psalmody of the "messianic" David through this gift of prophecy. At first sight, the prose note's purpose was to list the components of David ben Jesse's tehillim and shirim. Both the prefatory and conclud ing lines, however, seem to indicate that the enumeration of the com positions was only a subsidiary feature of the note. The author chooses to stress the prophetic inspiration of David the anointed deliverer of Israel.77 Formally, the note functions as a type of commentary upon 2 Samuel 23:1-7. The author apparently understood this biblical pas sage not as a psalm, but as a biographical report, and felt free to add material drawn from Isaiah 11—12 as well as other sources. David thus became not only the prototype for an eschatological deliverer, but the author of a Tehillim Hagadol via prophetic inspiration. The Hodu and Hallel of the Tehillim Hagadol Before proceeding to examine the remainder of 11Q Psalms3 a meth odological observation is in order.

Since a Psalter presumably contains selections from the traditional Book of Psalms, it is the principle of selection rather than the mere presence of Psalms that matters in the long run. This principle places special significance upon the noncanonical elements and compo sitions contained in 11Q Psalms1*, the most important of these compo sitions being the prose note just analyzed in detail. The beginning of the manuscript is fragmentary, and the material preceding what is labeled column 1 is more damaged than the rest. San ders and later Yadin have salvaged remnants that bear the labels A, B, CI, CII, D, and E.y8 Both scholars appear to assume that the scroll began with Psalm 101. It seems possible, however, if not more likely, that the scroll actually commenced with Psalm 100. Aside from paleo graphic considerations, the content of Psalm too seems particularly fit ting for a position at the beginning of 11Q Psalms3: מזמור לתודה הריעו ליי כל הארץ עבדו את יי בשמחה באו לפניו ברננה דעו כי יי הוא אלהים הוא עשנו ולו אנחנו עמו וצאן מרעיתו באו שעריו בתודה הצרתיו בתהלה הודו לו ברכו שמו כי טוב יי לעולם חסדו ועד דר ודר אמונתו "A psalm of thanksgiving.

Wilson, Editing, 85.</page><page sequence="21">[21] david's eschatological psalter 43 Rabbinic tradition maintains that this psalm accompanied the offer ing of the thanksgiving sacrifice (todah), whose ritual is described in Le viticus 7:1 iff.80 This interpretation is apparently based upon verse 4 ("enter into His gates with thanksgiving [todah], and into His courts with praise"). For the compiler of 11Q Psalms3, however, the immediately succeeding line may have been the most significant: הודו לו ברכו שמו כי טוב יי לעולם חסדו ועד דר ודר אמונתו (W.4C-5). Here in Psalm 100 is the line that is featured so frequently in the hallel portion of the Psalter and in the hymnic fragments contained in the Chronicler. The Chron icier in fact assigns the hodu line to David himself. The remaining por tion of the line ((ועד דר ודר אמונתו) harmonizes with the eschatological ori entation of the scroll. Psalm 100 was then presumably followed by what has been labeled Fragments A-E. Fragment A-CI contain portions of Psalms 101 and 102 that require no explanation because they are sequential. Fragment CII continues with Psalm 102 and apparently Psalm 103.81 Fragments D-E, however, present the unusual sequence of Psalms 109, 118, 104, 147, and the first lines of Psalm 105, succeeded on column 1 by the remainder of Psalm 105. Two explanations are possible for this order ing. Perhaps the canonical order of the last third of the Psalter did not yet exist and it was still possible to arrange the psalms in a rather free manner.82 The other explanation is that the psalms are selected and arranged on the basis of liturgical elements contained within them. For example, Psalm 109:21 (ואתה יי אדני עשה אתי למען שמך כי טוב חסדך הצילני) contains a phrase that echoes the hodu strophe of Psalm 100:40-5. The immediately subsequent Psalm 118:24-29 is a central fo eus of the synagogal hallel liturgy, which concludes with the recitation of the hodu (Ps 118:29). Verse 28 of the same Psalm contains the im portant line אלי אתה ואודך אלהי ארוממך, which calls to mind both Exodus 15 and Isaiah 12. The liturgical importance of Psalm 118 is further un derscored by its reemployment in column 16, between Psalm 136 and a liturgical adaptation of Psalm 145. Psalm 136, the so-called hallel hagadol,hagadol, features the recurrent refrain of ki lecolam hasdo. Verses 1, 15, 16, 8, 9, and 29 of Psalm 118 immediately follow, thus beginning and concluding with the hodu. Then Psalm 145 is reproduced with the un canonical antistrophe ברוך יי וברוך שמו לעולם ועד concluding each line. This (80) Targum Psalm 100:1. (81) Fragment CII: 12 reads ... ]רני נפשי את י[ ... — a passage that could stem from either Psalm 103:1 or 104:1. Since Psalm 104 appears later in Fragment E, it seems assured that Psalm 103 is the text featured here. (82) Sanders, Cornell, 13—14.</page><page sequence="22">44 BEN zion wacholder [22] organizational use of Psalm 11883 suggests that there is a relationship between the use of the hallel at Qumran and in the synagogue. The superficial similarities uncovered, however, should not blind us to the essential differences between the Qumranic and synagogal litur gies. The Passover Haggadah splits the traditional hallel into two parts: Psalms 13-114 ג are recited before the meal, and Psalms 115-118 after the meal, the whole being concluded with the hallel hagadol or Psalm 136.84 Otherwise Psalm 136 forms part of the sabbatical and festival 85,פסוקי דזמראדזמרא a designation which might be roughly translated "Liturgical Psalms." Since Talmudic times the complete hallel consists of Psalms 113-118; these are recited on Passover eve and during the pilgrim fes tivals and Hanukkah. On the new moons and at the beginning of the second day of Passover (third day in the Diaspora), it is customary to omit the recitation of parts of Psalms 115 and 116.86 However, the pe culiar order attested in 11Q Psalms3 has no counterpart in the tradi tional siddur. Which of these two liturgical uses of Psalms 118 and 136 in the hallel approximates more closely to the liturgical pattern recorded in the Chronicler and in 1 Macabees is a moot question, but one further point is worth noting. The fact that Psalm 118 is included in the liturgies of both the Qumran sect and rabbinic Judaism, despite the presence of a line suggesting the concept of individual immortality and/or res urrection (verse 17), may indicate the extreme antiquity of the hallel prayer. The liturgical use of Psalm 118 apparently predates the sectar ian disputes that split the intelligentsia of Israel. Column 1 containing Psalm 105 is followed by column 2, which con tains Psalms 146 and 148. It will be noticed that Psalm 146 features some of the same ideas and themes found in Psalm 118; most importantly, man cannot expect deliverance from a fellow human being, but only from God. Moreover, it is the first of five psalms87 that begin and con elude with the word hallelujah, the primary term of the hallel. Psalm 148 contains the distinctive idea of the angels participating in the chorus of praise to God. This quick survey of the beginning of 11Q Psalms3 indicates some of the techniques employed by the compiler in assembling his scroll. (83) Wilson, Editing, 127-128, recognizes the use of halleluyah psalms for marking "seams" in the sequence of 11QPsalmsa. (84) See the summary of the Passover service provided by A.Z. Idelsohn,yeu!wA Liturgy and and its Development (New York, NY, 1932: repr. New York, NY, 1972), 175-184. (85) Ibid., 80. (86) Psalm 115:1-11 and Psalm 116:1-11 are omitted in this recitation. (87) I.e., Psalms 146-150.</page><page sequence="23">[23] david's eschatological psalter 45 The mizmor letodah (Psalm 100) presumably began this liturgical collec tion. In general, the author adhered to the traditional order of the Book of Psalms, but intermingled within this sequence are hodu and hallel com positions.88 These cohered with the general themes and ideology of the collection, the most important being that both men and angels join in pronouncing hodus and hallelujahs that are modeled after the Song at the Sea. At this point, it will be useful to step back and view the overall struc ture of the scroll. The scroll can be divided into three basic sections: 1) Fragment A — Column 2; 2) Columns 3-15; 3) Columns 16-28.89 We have already spent some time upon the first division. It is necessary, however, to return to the unusual sequence exhibited in the latter part of this first division of Psalms 103, 109, 118, 104, 147, 105, 146, and 148. Prior to Psalm 103 we have the traditional sequence of Psalms [100]—103. The total omission of Psalms 106—108 and 110—117 demands an explanation. The main thrust of Psalm 106, dealing with Israel's ingratitude and rebelliousness, may account for its exclusion from this context. The in appropriateness of Psalm 106 may have in turn prompted the exclusion of the subsequent Psalms 107-108 and 110. Psalm 109, it will be re called, appears in Fragment D. The presence of 109 would make more sense if it is presumed that Psalm 108 preceded it, since both compo sitions are attributed to David, and it contains the formulaic אשירה ואזמרה (verse 2) that we associate with the eschatological David. Psalm 109 continues in the same vein (note tehillah, verse !),justifying its près ence in this scroll. The absence of Psalms 110-117 is more problematic. They may not have been recognized as Davidic compositions, since none of them bear a Davidic superscription. Psalm 110 portrays Melchizedek as a priest king, yet nowhere in this scroll do we find any references to David as a priest. The content of Psalm 111 seems to reflect the personality of the Lawgiver more than it does that of David. Psalm 114, exclusively devoted to the miracle at the Sea, may have been viewed as a shir of the past — in direct tension with the shir hadash that the future David would lead Israel in singing. The possible unsuitability of Psalms 1 110-111 may have in turn led to the exclusion of Psalms 112 and 113 as well. The latter Psalm is anciently attested as the introduction to the Passover hallel (113-118). Perhaps polemical reasons related either to (88) Wilson argues that the juxtaposing of hodu and hallelujah compositions mark the "seams" of a larger psalmic collection. Cf. his Editing, 12g. (89) Also ibid., 127.</page><page sequence="24">46 BF,N ZION WACHOLDER [24] their employment by the religious establishment or to their characteristic association with the "first" Exodus led to the complete exclusion of Psalms 113—117. The special role that the compiler assigned to Psalm 118 in the com position of this scroll has been discussed above. The fact that this Psalm both begins and ends with the hodu appears to have been the reason that it was held in such esteem. As has been previously indicated, Isaiah 12, Ezra, the Chronicler, and perhaps Jeremiah 33:11 as well, all asso ciated the hodu with David — the Isaiah and Jeremiah passages, perhaps, with the additional overtone of the eschatological ben Jesse as well. Fol lowing Psalm 118 appear Psalms 104, 147, 105, and then surprisingly, Psalms 146 and 148. A glance at the content of these latter two Psalms may supply the reason for this strange placement. The compositions contained in the preceding fragments emphasize that David and the people of Israel would offer thanksgiving hymns at the end of time. In the opinion of the compiler, however, one group was lacking from this roster of celebrants — the heavenly beings. This thought apparently inspired the joining of Psalm 146:10 ([ימלוך יי [לעולם אלהיך ציון לדור ודור הללויה הללויה) to Psalm 148 ([הללו יי משמים . .. כוח מלאכיו הללוהו כול צבא[ו), which contains express mention of the angelic praise. Perhaps here we have another contrast between the Song at the Sea and the eschatological deliverance-song. The former was sung only by Moses and the Israelites, but the latter would be taken up by the whole created order, including the angels of heaven. The second basic section of 11Q Psalms3 is made up of columns 3—15, which contains 13 of the 15 traditional "Songs of Ascent" (shir hamcfalot) as well as Psalm 119. In the traditional Book of Psalms the shir hamacalot follow immediately after Psalm 119, but here Psalm 119 occurs after Psalm 132 and is followed by Psalms 135 and 136.90 Two questions con front us here: First, what accounts for the shift in position of the shir hamcfalothamcfalot relative to that of Psalm 119? And second, why are the final two canonical shir hamacalot, Psalms 133 and 134, omitted in this section only to reappear later, out of sequence? The basic supposition of this study is that the compiler of 11Q Psalms3 assembled this series of traditional and noncanonical compositions as representative of those songs that the eschatological Davidic deliverer would lead all Israel in singing at the End of Days. The compiler ap parently shifted the position of Psalm 119 so that it would follow a series (go) Psalm 119 stretches from Columns 6:11-14:6. For a discussion of the popularity of Psalm 119 at Qumran, see Sanders, Cornell, 17-19.</page><page sequence="25">[25] david's eschatological psalter 47 of shir hamacalot Psalms. Three of the shir harrufalot compositions in this consecutive series are assigned by their superscriptions to Davidic au thorship;9' in fact, 11Q Psalms3 increases this number by attributing the previously unassigned Psalm 123 to David.92 Psalm 127 is assigned with in both the Massoretic Text and 11Q Psalms3 to David's son Solomon. Many of the shir hamacalot can be applied to events in the life of the historical David, suggesting an autobiographical setting. The thrust of Psalm 119, by contrast, is universal. The first verse (אשרי תמימי דרך ההלכים בתורת יי), as well as its succeeding lines, apply to anyone who concerns himself with the teachings of the Law. Our compiler ap parently wished to make the point that this Psalm arose from and was concerned primarily with both the historical and eschatological Davids. This messianic motif may explain why Psalm 132, concerned with the dedication of the sanctuary, precedes the Torah-Psalm 119. The superscription shir hamacalot, traditionally explained as referring to the ascent to the altar,93 might have received an additional nuance from the compiler of 11Q Psalms3,94 who may have viewed the macalot as a series of stages or steps that a "singer" ascended toward the goal of pious perfection represented by the sage of Psalm 119. The first person mode of address in Psalm 119 allows its reader to identify with this ideal psalmist. After finishing Psalm 119, the compiler returned to the traditional Psalter for Psalms 135 and 136, the latter containing the characteristic hoduhodu antistrophe that serves as a bridge to the third section of the scroll. It is in this third section (columns 16—28) that Sanders's hypothesis that 11Q Psalms3 represents an alternative canon of the Book of Psalms finds its support; paradoxically, this same section can be used to argue that the scroll is primarily a liturgical composition. The section contains sev eral apocryphal compositions interspersed among the remaining sixteen canonical Hebrew Psalms from the traditional Book of Psalms. Uncov ering the rationale that may have determined the composition and ar rangement of this section is complex. Almost all commentators assume that the compiler of this scroll had before him a text more or less iden deal with that of the traditional Psalter. (gi) Psalms 122, 124, and 131. (92) Column 3:15.

But this line is immediately followed by verse 15 of Psalm 118 (qol rinnah . . .)! The conjunction of Psalm 136, apparently preserved in its entirety in the preceding column, and a "catena"96 of verses drawn from Psalm 118, which has already appeared in the early portion of the scroll, is extremely interesting. Both Psalms feature the antiphonic refrain כי 97,לעולם חסדו and both are part of the hallel tradition. There must be a liturgical intention behind this arrangement since the catena continues with verses 16, 8, 9, and 29 of Psalm 118 (Column 16:2-6). One cannot suppose that the compiler copied a Vorlage that lacked the traditional content or arrangement of verses in Psalm 118, because fragment E earlier in the scroll (as well as 4Q Psalms6)98 reproduces the traditional arrangement of the canonical psalm. Why the editor chose the verses that he did at this particular point deserves a more careful investigation than can be given here.99 I can only conjecture that this selection of verses from Psalm 118 fits the overarching liturgical scheme of the com piler of 11Q Psalms3 — the anointed one's victorious song over the en emies of God. There is a peculiar addition to the traditional wording of Psalm 118:9 — du טוב לחסות ביי מבטוח בנדיבים טוב לבטוח ביי מבטוח באלף ". . . it is better to rely on the Lord than to rely upon a thousand peoples."100 This phrase represents the third "noncanonical" addition to 11Q Psalms3.101 In its context the phrase probably alludes to the final victory of Israel over the hosts of nations at the End of Days. This line may, however, reflect the historical situation of the Athenian victory over the Persian forces at Marathon, or Alexander's decisive defeat of Darius III at Gaugamela.

From line 7 of column 16, and continuing on to the surviving frag ment of column 17, is Psalm 145. This version of Psalm 145 contains three interesting features.102 The superscription of the traditional Psalm 145 is tehillah ledawid; here it is called tefillah ledawiyd. If this is not a slip, which seems unlikely given the overall coherence of the manuscript, what can be the reason for this alteration? Perhaps the compiler intend ed to bring this superscription into conformity with others in the Book of Psalms.103 One might note particularly Psalm 72:20: כלו תפלות דוד בן ישי. On such a basis, it is possible that when the compiler intends to refer to compositions from the traditional Psalter he employs the name tefillah and reserves tehillah for the messianic compositions. The second interesting feature of the scroll's copy of Psalm 145 is that after each verse of the Psalm, a refrain is added: ברוך יי וברוך שמו לעולם ועד. This antiphonal response dispels any doubt about the liturgical elements contained within this collection. It serves the same purpose as the more familiar response כי לעולם חסדו that appears, for example, in the so-called hallel hagadol (Psalm 136) and in other hymns. Why was only Psalm 145 chosen to feature this refrain? Apparently its opening line, ארוממך אלוהי המלך ואברכה שמך לעולם ועד, was interpreted as echoing the last strophe of 2 Samuel 22:1-51 and the Final line of the Song at the Sea (Exodus 15:18). Psalm 145 is also expressly attributed to David. Interestingly enough, Psalm 145 (preceded by the introductory lines of Psalms 84:5 and 144:15) is the most frequently used composition from the Psalter in the synagogal liturgy, being recited three times daily.104 The attention paid to this Psalm in the Qumranic scroll indicates that both Pharisaic and sectarian liturgies placed special emphasis upon this composition. Apparently the נashrey (the later designation for this psalm) was one of the earliest components of organized public worship. The synagogal response to a blessing — ברוך הוא וברוך שמו . . . אמן — bears some formal resemblance to the antiphonal refrain ברוך יי וברוך שמו לעולם ועד appended to each line of the Qumranic version of Psalm (102)(102) A fourth additional feature is the presence in 11Q Psalms" of the nun verse missing in most Hebrew manuscripts of this psalm (cf. Sanders, DJD IV, 38): נאמן אלוהים בדבריו וחסיד בכול מעשיו. It is restored in modern translations of Psalm 145 on the basis of the LXX (πιστός κύριος έν τοις λόγοις αυτού και όσιος έν πάσι τοις έργοις αύτού). S. Safrai has called my attention to a similar phrase within the second paragraph of blessings following the reading of the Sabbath haftarah in the traditional Siddur: נאמן אתה הוא יי אלהינו ונאמנים דבריך.

Tur Orah Hayyim is the first to discuss this, as a practice recom mended by the author's grandfather, Rabbi Yehiel.105 The respective wordings are quite close, and one wonders whether these two refrains are interdependent or only coincidental. This response should also be compared with the refrain that appears in the Song of the Three Young Men, inserted by the Septuagint between verses 23 and 24 of Daniel 3. One might note in particular LXX Daniel 3:26 (cf. 3:52): "Blessed are you,you, O Lord, God of our fathers, and worthy of praise; and may your name be be glorified forever!" and the most characteristic form of the refrain that reappears throughout this psalm: ". . . sing praise to Him and highly exalt Him forever!"106 The last two words of the response (lecolatn waced) were clearly meant to connect with the final verse of Psalm 145: תהלת 107.יי ידבר פי ויברך כל בשר שם קדשו לעולם ועד The sense and significance of the third interesting feature of the scroll's version of Psalm 145, the concluding note zot lezikkaron, remains obscure. Sanders translates this phrase as "this is for a memorial,"108 basing his rendition on passages such as Joshua 4:7, Exodus 12:14, and Exodus 13:9.109 Another possible translation of the two words is "this is for memory," that is, for memorization. It is a liturgical note, not as Sanders alleges,110 a dedicatory or redemptive phrase. It may perhaps be a reference to the hasosrot hazikkaron 'memorial trumpets', specifying that the recitation of this Psalm is to be accompanied by blasts on these special musical instruments.111 Whether it refers to the entire Psalm or only to the responsive additions remains an open question. If the two words refer to what precedes them, they may mean that the antiphonal addition to Psalm 145 is to be memorized. They may, however, refer to what follows upon the concluding lines of column 17, where room remains for another psalm prior to the apocryphal composition Psalm 154 on column 18.112 (1c&gt;5) Jacob ben Asher, Tur 'Orah Hayyim 124. (106) Flusser-Safrai ("Shirey Dauiid", 101) direct attention to an almost identical refrain featured in the heavenly liturgy reported in 1 Enoch 39:13: "Blessed be Thou, and blessed be the name of the Lord forever and ever." Here this laudation functions as the response of a chorus of Watchers to the recitation of the heavenly qedushah by a host of fellow angelic beings reported in the previous verse. Compare also 1 Enoch 61:11: "Blessed is He, and may the name of the Lord of Spirits be blessed forever and ever." (107) Sanders, Cornell, 16. (108) Ibid., 67. (log) Ibid., 16. (110) Ibid., 16-17.

If we suppose that columns 16 and 17, with their conjunction of the hallel hagadol, and the catena from the hallel-psà\m 118 and the newly antiphonal Psalm 145 represent a liturgical prelude to the mes sianic tehillim (which as we are informed later will be 3600 in number), then the fusion of traditional texts and texts derived from pseudepi graphic sources is no longer so problematic. The absence of first-person personal pronouns in the surviving lines of this composition could lead one to believe that the poem is a sapiential ode.116 Psalm 154 can, however, be strongly identified with the David of the literary tradition. In Psalm 145 David extols God's favor upon the saddiq and the hasid. In Psalm 154, the king shares the wisdom that God has granted him with humankind. David makes the promulgation of God's favor his highest goal, equal to the duty of offering choice sac rifices.1 rifices.117 The heeding of David's counsel will bring deliverance to Israel from the oppression of the nations.118 What began in Psalm 145 as a "prayer of David" (תפלה לדויד) concludes with David leading the people of the Lord to an ultimate victory. This Psalm is followed on column 19 by another apocryphal compo sition that Sanders has named a "Plea for Deliverance""9 that would appear to be uttered by the anointed deliverer himself. Whereas Psalms 145 and 154 portray David as an expounder of wisdom, the Plea for Deliverance presents him as a lowly creature, barely superior to the mag got and the worm.120 Only human beings possess the capacity to sing praise to the Lord and to recount His marvels, but the singer feels de (113) For a discussion of the Hebrew texts of the Syriac non-canonical psalms which appear in 11Q Psalmsa, see Sanders, DJD IV, 53-76; idem, Cornell, 94-112.

It may refer to David's mindset after the murder of Uriah (2 Samuel 12:13), or to the role of Satan in taking the census of the people (1 Chronicles 21:1). One should note the lines that refer to the singer's older brothers and to the family of Jesse: "May my brothers rejoice with me, my father's household who are dejected . . ." (column 19:17).122 The precise sense of hashomemim "dejected" is obscure, but may imply that David's family were subject to persecution by Saul. The remainder of column 1g and the extant portion of column 20 revert to the traditional Psalter, replicating first the latter part of Psalm 13g and then Psalm 137. This departure from the canonical sequence may indicate the compiler's independence of mind when approaching the traditional Book of Psalms. The first-person style of address in Psalm 13g may have, to the editor, harmonized better with what pre cedes it in the scroll than would have the nationalistic character of Psalm 137, which relates the confrontation between captor and prisoner in Babylon. Psalm 137 is also thematically extrinsic in a compilation that is devoted to David. The compiler may have determined not to omit any of the canonical psalms that follow Psalm 118. On the other hand, one must recall that the scroll constantly shifts its focus from the his torical David to the eschatological David, the deliverer who would lead Israel at the End of Days. Perhaps the inclusion of Psalm 137 is meant to suggest that even the enemies of Israel would be captivated and en thralled by the lyrics of David. Following Psalm 137 on column 21 is Psalm 138, expected from the traditional arrangement. Columns 21 and 22 as a whole display again the fusion of traditional Psalms with modern compositions, a combina tion of the נodekha type of composition with the self-abasement hymn, or the Lord as creator of the world with the Lord as guardian of Zion. Verses 1-6 of Psalm 138 reproduce the classic hodu style that has dom inated the scroll since its presumed inception with Psalm 100. The re mainder of Psalm 138 (verses 7-8) pleads for personal deliverance from (121) Column 19:15—16. (122) Whereas Sanders interprets the "Plea" as an individual Danklied, I view this line as referring to the family of David, and thus the whole composition as a Davidic prayer for mercy. The "dejection" of David's family might be compared with the motif of "jeal ousy" expressed by his relatives in the pseudo-Davidic "psalm" found in Pseudo-Philo, Liber Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum 59.

Attached to this psalm is an apocryphal acrostic composition known previously from Greek, Latin, Syriac, and medieval Hebrew texts of Ben Sira.123 This piece corresponds to Ben Sira 51:13-30.124 The poem re lates the author's search for wisdom and a proper understanding of To rah from his tutors. As such it appears to be a purely sapiential type of hymn, but here it functions as a Davidic praise of wisdom. Following the end of this composition at the top of column 22 occurs another apocryphal psalm. This poem was named by Sanders "Apostro phe to Zion."125 It is also an acrostic composition and seems to consist of three beats per line, just as the Ben Sira canticle that precedes it. The psalm is unusual because it appears to address the personified Zion as if she stood in the place of the deity.126 At the end of the Apostrophe to Zion, Psalm 93 is introduced into the sequence.127 The Psalm occurs outside the ostensible scope of this scroll (i.e., MT Psalms 100—150). The introductory hallelujah could ex plain this intrusion.128 In the canonical Book of Psalms the term hallelujah hallelujah does not appear until Psalm 113; that is, the introductory psalm for the hallel. Our compiler seems to assert that Psalm 93, in spite of its locus in the traditional order, should be appropriated for the "new" hallel. It will be recalled that according to Mishnah Tamid 7:4 this psalm was recited every Friday.129 Another reason for the Psalm's inclusion at this point may be that the preceding Apostrophe to Zion did not contain a single line that could be taken as a reference to the Temple. Perhaps the last verse of Psalm 93 (עדתיך נאמנו מאד לביתך נאוה קדש יי לארך ימים), with its mention of the sanctuary, was intended to link David and the eternal sanctuary.

It is difficult to ex plain why this particular extract from the classical shir hamcfalot series occurs at this point; perhaps the compiler's predilection for contrast prompted him to place the pastorally oriented Psalm 133 before the martially flavored Psalm 144 that immediately follows.133 After the con elusion of Psalm 144 at the top of column 24 occurs yet another apoc ryphal composition, Psalm 155 or Syriac Psalm 111,134 which is then fol lowed by Psalm 142.135 This insertion of Psalm 155 between the two canonical Psalms 144 and 142 must have had some sort of justification. A linkage between the precedent Psalm 144 and this apocryphal text may have been based on the use of Psalm 144 in Jewish liturgical tradition. In the synagogal tradition the final verse of Psalm 144 (אשרי העם שככה לו אשרי העם שיי אלהיו) is detached from its locus and appended to another psalmic quote from Psalm 84:5 to introduce the recitation of Psalm 145, and this particular rearrangement became a mainstay of the daily and Sabbath liturgy. Un fortunately the portion of column 23 where the initial portion of such an introductory line may have existed is missing. Column 24 begins with the final verse of Psalm 144. It seems possible that Psalms 144:15 serves here, as it does in the later traditional service, as a liturgical invocation to recite Psalm 155. Whatever the linkage of Psalms 144 and 145, the relationship be tween Psalm 155 and the subsequent Psalm 142 seems assured. Both compositions share a common theme and exhibit close verbal echoes. A crucial connection may be the superscription of MT Psalm 142: משכיל לדוד בהיותו במערה תפלה "a maskil by David while staying in the cave, a prayer." The compiler of 11Q Psalms3 evidently took these headings seriously, and they should not be disregarded in the modern scholar's search for possible explanations of the scroll's odd sequence.

Psalm 142 is followed by Psalms 143, 149, and 150.136 The latter two hallelujah hallelujah psalms conclude the traditional Book of Psalms. Apparently the compiler viewed these two Psalms with their emphasis upon praise and musical accompaniment as a fitting peroration to David's musical accomplishments. The final three columns of 11Q Psalms3, columns 26-28, can be di vided into four subsections: 1) what Sanders termed the "Hymn to the Creator,"Creator,"137 2) the quotation of 2 Samuel 23:1-7,138 3) the prose note regarding David's liturgical productions,'39 and 4) the concluding Psalms 140, 134, 151A, and 151B.140 As Sanders has noted, the Hymn to the Creator lacks both topical and metrical consistency.141 It is formed from a fusion of phrases and lines drawn from a variety of biblical and extra-canonical writings.'42 I believe that this pastiche of quotations was not intended to form a single composition, but is the earliest example of a custom well attested in medieval manuscripts, a distinctive type of scribal colophon.'43 These colophons consist of lines gleaned from Scripture to which were often appended some scribal information concerning authorship and the date of the completion of the manuscript, and were intended to express grat itude to God for the successful production of the text. Phrases stemming from the doxology and other lines extolling God were particularly ap propriate for such a colophon. Unlike the medieval scribes, however, who generally supplied personal information about themselves, our scribe goes on to furnish biographical data about the imputed author of of 11Q Psalms3 itself — David ben Jesse. The lines of praise were then presumably followed by a recitation (136) Column 25:6—16 (= Psalm 143:1-8); column 26:1-3 (= Psalm 149:7—9); column 26:4-8 (= Psalm 150). (137) Column 26:9-15.

These lines have been dealt with in detail above. The insertion of the so-called "Last Words of David" here provides an apology for the pe culiar structure of the scroll vis-à-vis the traditional Book of Psalms. The apparent need for such an apology tends to support the argument that the compiler of 11Q Psalms3 was aware of the existence and perhaps even the "canonicity" of the traditional composition and sequence of the Book of Psalms. It seems likely that the composer of 2 Samuel 23:1-7 understood these "Last Words of David" to signify a contrast between the roles of the literary-historical David described in the Books of Sam uel and of the eschatological David portrayed as נעים זמרות 44',ישראל the divinely inspired prophetic singer of the future Israel. The compiler of 11Q Psalms3, on the other hand, perceived 2 Samuel 23:1-7 differently. For him the term ha3aharonim apparently signified the ex istence of Davidic compositions outside the traditional number in the Book of Psalms, and essentially redefines the role of David in the com position of tehillim. The נעים זמרות ישראל was continuing to produce psal mody; the compiler thus felt free to rearrange the traditional compo sition and order of the Psalter. The inclusion of 2 Samuel 23:1-7 along with the accompanying prose commentary that follows lends support to the hypothesis of Sanders that our compiler regarded this scroll as a "Book of Tehillim" or as a tehillim-like work. As noted above, the prose note regarding the literary activity of David must be viewed as a commentary upon the immediately precedent 2 Samuel 23:1-7, its most important point being that David composed his works under prophetic inspiration (column 27:11). This emphasis upon the prophetic status of David may have been intended as a polemical jab against the Pharisees who counted the Book of Psalms among the ketubimketubim rather than among the collection of prophets. Our compiler, like the Chronicler and Ezra-Nehemiah before him, credits David with establishing the sacrificial service at the sanctuary. The altar and Temple envisioned in the note, however, appear to be neither the Solomonic structure of the past nor the sanctuary construct ed by the returnees from Babylon. This Temple seems rather to be iden tical with that future Temple that will be constructed at the End of Days.'45 The most important indication of this conclusion is that the calendar presupposed as operative at this Temple is the same one that governs the sacrificial ritual contained in Jubilees and 11Q Torah. As (144) 2 Samuel 23:1 read in conjunction with the Targum to that verse. (145) 11QT 29:8-10; Jubilees 1:27-29; 1 Enoch 90:28-29; 91:13; 4Q Florilegium :1-6.</page><page sequence="35">[35] david's eschatological psalter 57 noted above, it cannot be mere coincidence that the thirty festival songs composed by David correspond exactly with the calendar of feasts pre scribed in 11Q Torah. It would seem that, according to the distinctive ideology of the sect, Moses provided the sacrificial rites and David the lyrical hymns for the eschatological Temple. The linkage of David's songs of praise with the sacrificial commandments of the Torah in this note reinforces such an assumption. Psalms 140 and 134 occur between this note and the final Psalms151A and B. Their position here is quite puzzling. The compiler of the scroll might have overlooked these two Psalms in the course of his rearrange ment,'46 or their placement here is deliberate, resulting from topical, literary, or theological considerations. Prior to the publication of 11Q Psalms3 the so-called Psalm 151 was known only from the Septuagint, its daughter versions, and various Syr iac manuscripts.147 In 11Q Psalms3 a Hebrew text for this apocryphal composition concludes the extant columns of the manuscript.148 What appears as a single work in the Septuagint (and dependent versions) seems to be two separate psalms in this Hebrew recension; Sanders ac cordingly designated these two parts Psalms 151A and B.149 The compiler's inclusion of these compositions seems to follow from the na ture of 11Q Psalms3 as a whole. One might say that the Hebrew Bible presents two Davids. The "first" (or "literary-historical") David emerges from the accounts rendered in the Books of Samuel, where David rises from his humble shepherd origins to become the greatest king of Israel and the founder of the dynasty that ruled Judah. The account of David's life provided by the later Books of Chronicles replicates in part the Deu teronomistic perspective but also presents a "second" (or "idealized") David. This David is not overly concerned with statecraft. His particular interest is described as overseeing the building of a sanctuary and or dering the rituals that will pertain to its proper functioning.150 It is true that a similar picture of David emerges from the story related in 2 Sam uel 7, but the Chronicler has developed this image of David much fur ther.151 Links between the "first" and the "second" David crop up in (146) Skehan, "Qumran and Old Testament Criticism", 170. (147) See the discussions, with relevant bibliography, in Sanders, DJD IV, 53-64 and Cornell,Cornell, 94-103. For the Syriac evidence note especially J.

The texts of the Psalms themselves contain numerous references to suffering, per secution, and the threats of both personal and national enemies, as well as passages expressing faith, exaltation, and confidence in divine salva tion. The Psalms, however, rarely contain autobiographical allusions to the activities of the "first" David as described in great detail in the Books of Samuel. The replication of 2 Samuel 23:1-7 at the bottom of column 26 and the top of column 27, plus the extensive prose colophon added by the compiler, was designed to call attention to the difference between "Da vid" (the "first" of the above) and "David ben Jesse" (the "second" of the above). Pointing to 2 Samuel 23:1b (נאם דוד בך ישי), Psalm 151A.1 (הללויה לדויד בן ישי) hints that when God first commanded Samuel to anoint a replacement for Saul, the command was couched in such a way that David was not specifically mentioned by name. Perhaps only the designation "ben Jesse" was employed. Samuel himself was unable to discern which of Jesse's sons was destined for rulership (cf. 1 Samuel 16:3-10). Psalms 151A and B address themselves to the problem of the relationship between David the inspired psalmist and the historical Da vid who was a shepherd and warrior in Saul's service. Sanders has called attention to the unusual superscription given Psalm 151A in the scroll. Here the psalm is entitled הללויה לדויד בן ישי, whereas the LXX superscription to Psalm 151 reads Oéxoç ô 1[&gt;aXpôç lôtÔYpacjiog elç Aaneiô xai ë^œBev xof! âpiOpoê ôxe êfiovopâxrioEv xtjj jToXtâô. The author of the Greek superscription assures us, as Sanders has noted, that this psalm is authentically Davidic, suggesting that there was doubt over its authenticity.'5" The doubters probably based their suspicion upon the lack of this composition in the traditional Book of Psalms. Sanders remarks that apparently no equivalent doubt was op erative at Qumran where the heading הללויה לדויד בן ישי was supplied.'53 Sanders views the Hebrew and Greek superscriptions as independent of each other,'54 but this is not so clear. The Greek title could derive from a Hebrew version that is now lost.'55 Sensitive to the polemical indication of the Hebrew Vorlage of the Greek heading, the compiler (151) G. von Rad, Dos Geschichtsbilddes Chronistischen Werkes (Stuttgart, 1930), 119-132; A.C.

In other words, it is just as likely, if not more so, that the compiler of the scroll (or of his Vorlage) changed the form of this psalm's ascription as if the psalm had possessed two or more independent superscriptions. Presumably the author of the heading that lies behind the Greek ascription was unaware of the as cription found in the scroll. The compiler of 11Q Psalms3, on the other hand, could very well have been cognizant of both forms. The form of the ascription found in the scroll remains strange. First it is called a hallelujah, and then it is attributed to David ben Jesse. There is no analogue to this form of superscription in the traditional Psalter. We know of halleluyah-psalms, but nowhere else is hallelujah used to in troduce an ascription. There is also no superscription that concludes with the patronymic "ben Jesse." The sense of hallelujah in this composition is also unusual.'56 The title would be appropriate for a psalm that began or ended with that particular invocation, but neither Psalm 151A nor B begins or concludes (in the case of 151B presumably) in this fashion. The heading may be designed to direct attention to Psalm 150 which constantly reiterates the term haleluhu throughout its lines. It might be significant that both Psalm 150 and Psalm 151A contain lines which mention the offering of praise via musical instruments.157 Another explanation might be that the title hallelujah hallelujah does not refer specifically to this apocryphal work but func tions as a general descriptive term that applies to the liturgy of 11Q Psalms3 as a whole. Perhaps the sectarian compiler designated by the word hallelujah what later tradition came to call the hallel. The heading for Psalm 151B is also exceptional: תחלת גב[1]רה ל[ד1]יד משמשתו נביא אלוהים "At the beginning of David's power after the prophet of God had anointed him.'"58 These words seem to presuppose some introductory matter that is missing. The superscription of Psalm 151A could have been intended for repetition here as well. As stated above, Sanders views the different superscriptions of the Hebrew and Greek versions of Psalm 151 as being totally independent of each other. In addition, Sanders regards the Greek version as being (156) Strugnell observes that "Ps 151 is most unhalleluyah-like" (ibid., 267). He sug gests that the halleluyah may have migrated from the end of Psalm 150 to the beginning of Psalm 151A (presuming an earlier manuscript in which these two psalms were sequen tial).

The Greek version states that it is a Davidic autograph; the Hebrew declares it to be a Davidic hallelujah. If one operates with the assumption that the two headings are interdependent, it would seem more likely that the Hebrew Vorlage of the text preserved in the Sep tuagint has priority over the superscription(s) contained in 11Q Psalms3 151A and B. Either the scribe responsible for the form of the heading preserved in the Greek secularized the more pietistic Hebrew rendering, or the Qurnran compiler viewed the Greek heading as being too secular or mundane and altered it in the interests of piety. Such pietization is evident in the heading contained at the beginning of Psalm 151B, for it suggests that David's victory over Goliath could be achieved only after he had been anointed by the prophet of God.160 The phrase tehillah gev[u]rahgev[u]rah "the beginning of (David's) power" in the mouth of a sectarian might have the double reference of referring to the appearance of the eschatological David. It seemed imperative to stress that David's power stemmed not solely from his own physical gifts but also from the mes sianic anointment bestowed upon him by the representative of God. Much of what has been said with regard to the superscriptions can be applied to the text of the psalm as well. Must we suppose, along with Sanders, that the Septuagint fused two separate compositions (Hebrew A and B) into a single work (Psalm 151)? Is it not possible that the Vor lagelage that lies behind column 28 had already split a single composition into two separate parts? It must be reemphasized that what Sanders identified as a separate superscription to Psalm 151B may not have been intended as such. Little resemblance exists between this line and the tra ditional superscriptions found in the Book of Psalms. The Date and Provenance of 11Q Psalms3 Four separate issues are at stake in the discussion regarding the age and provenance of this unusual scroll: 1. 1. the date of the manuscript itself; 2. the date of an archetype for this manuscript, if any; 3. the date of additions to older compositions; 4. the date of the non-canonical texts.

The date and provenance of the manuscript itself are the least problematic aspects of our discussion. Based on the testimony and an alysis of archeologists and paleographers, the physical scroll antedates the destruction of the Qumran site around 68 c.e. Scholars who have examined the script identify its style as Herodian, thus locating its pro duction sometime during the first half of the first century c.e.161 Its professional appearance suggests that the scroll was written by a skilled copyist, not likely to have been the original compiler of the scroll. There are indications that other copies exhibiting a similar arrangement of content to that of 11Q Psalms2 were once extant,162 and copies of certain noncanonical components of the scroll have been identified in other contexts.163 It is impossible to determine whether the copyist of 11Q Psalms3 possessed an autograph, which he used as his Vorlage, or inter vening copies of a more distant autograph. Apart from exceptional cir cumstances, one must suppose the passage of a decent interval of time between the composition or editing of a given work and subsequent copies. 2. It follows that for a determination of the date of composition of the work represented by 11Q Psalms3, we must estimate what can be considered a "decent interval". A reasonable rule of thumb is fifty years. Thus a latest possible date for the autograph would be around the turn of the era or perhaps a few decades earlier. By autograph, I am refer ring to the entire composition, including its peculiar arrangement, its supplemental material, and the noncanonical works included within it. To determine the earliest date of composition, relative dating must be employed. Assuming that the compiler of the scroll had before him all of its constituent parts, it follows that the earliest date for any of these components precedes the compilation of 11Q Psalms3. In addition, some time probably elapsed between the composition of any supplemental material and the point when 11Q Psalms3 was edited into its final form. There is no means of determining a priori whether supplemental ad ditions originated with the compiler of the scroll or from authors who antedate the time of the compiler. 3. Scholars who have discussed the nature and purpose of 11Q Psalms3 concentrate on evidence supplied by traditional or apocryphal components of the scroll, largely ignoring for the purpose of dating the supplementary additions that distinguish this manuscript. This study will attempt to utilize this material as valuable evidence for chronological (161) Sanders, DJD IV, 6-9 and Cornell, 10. (162) Notably 11Q Psalmsb (cf. n.132 above).

The antiphonal refrain to Psalm 145: It will be recalled that 11Q Psalms3 appends to every verse of Psalm 145 an unusual response of ברוך יי וברוך שמו לעולם ועד. The final two words of the refrain expand upon concepts found in the text of the psalm, but more significantly, echo the concluding line of the Mosaic Song at the Sea: יי ימלל לעולם ועד. The first part of the refrain resembles verse 1 of Psalm 145: ואברכה שמך לעולם ועד. We can only conjecture as to why this addition was made. One explanation offered above related this refrain to the liturgical use made of Psalm 145 in the traditional Siddur. Another possible explanation may involve the peculiar value given to time in sectarian ideology. Unfor tunately the surviving portion of 11Q Psalms3 gives us little indication that chronomessianic terminology was featured in the scroll, but the presence of this phrase in the peculiar refrain provides some evidence that eschatological motifs were not absent from the scroll. b. The phrase !האת לזכרו: This phrase is enigmatic both with regard to intrinsic sense and to its use in the text; it is even unclear whether the phrase refers to what preceded it (Psalm 145) or to what followed it in the scroll. The only statement that can be made with confidence is that this phrase is unprecedented in both biblical and nonbiblical texts. If we suppose that this phrase refers to the !חצוצרות הזכרו mentioned in 1Q Milhamah,164 it is a clear reference to sectarian cultic life. c. The additional clause in Psalm 118:9: The phrase טוב לבטוח ביי מבטוח באלף עם "it is better to rely on the Lord than to rely upon a thou sand peoples" is found neither in the received text of Psalm 118 nor in any other ancient version. The insertion of a line into a sacred text indicates more than an individual scribal whim. It could reflect a re action to political events either within or outside of Judaea, perhaps to the Greek defeats of Persia at Marathon or Gaugamela. Reliance upon the God of Israel may allude to the Maccabean victories over the Se leucid armies. The description of the celebration of Hanukkah in 1 Mac cabees notes that the hallel was recited at this occasion.165 However, if one regards 11Q Psalms3 as predominantly an eschatological text, this line could be taken to refer to the future victory of the David ben Jesse expected at the End of Days. The absence of any versional support for this addition favors the view that this line originated with the sect itself. 164) See n.111 above.</page><page sequence="41">[41] david's eschatological psalter 63 d. The prose commentary following 2 Samuel 23'.[1]—7: We have ar gued above that the prose commentary regarding the nature of David's literary activity reflects an idealization of the eventual inaugurator of the eschatological sanctuary and its cult. These lines should therefore be very important for the establishment of the date and provenance of the material contained in the scroll. The information about "thirty fes tival songs" betrays a knowledge of the festival cycle adumbrated in 11Q Torah. The compiler moreover may have been acquainted with the so called Shirot cOlat Hashabbat.166 However, the idealized portrait of David presented in this note does not cohere very well with the evaluation of David contained in the Damascus Covenant. There we read: "And about the prince it is written: Let him not multiply wives unto himself; but David had not read in the sealed Book of the Law which was inside the ark of the covenant, because it had not been opened in Israel since the day when Eleazar and Jehoshua {and Joshua} and the Elders died, forasmuch as they worshipped the Ashtoreth, and it was hidden (and was not) revealed until (the son of) Zadok arose. And the deeds of David were reckoned (as inadvertent sins), except the blood of Uriah, and God allowed them to him" (CD 5:1-6).167 There is doubt regarding the pre cise meaning of this passage, particularly as to whether God pardoned or condemned David's acts of adultery,168 but sharp criticism is being leveled here against the historical David. This critique clashes with the evaluation of David contained in the scroll, especially the statement that David was תמים בכול דרכיו לפני אל ואנשים (column 27:3)! How does one reconcile this divergence? There was disagreement within sectarian circles over the identity of the eschatological deliverer who would save Israel. The Damascus Cov enant repeatedly refers to "the anointed one(s) from Aaron and Isra el,"169 a phrase usually interpreted to refer to a dual messiahship of king and priest.170 The anointed figure expected from Israel might very well have been expected to be a member of the Davidic house, although it remains possible that sectarian exegetes were divided among them (166) Cf. nn.62-64 above.

Some may have regarded David as hopelessly corrupt because of his adultery and po lygamy, while others may have felt he had been forgiven these trans gressions. Still others may have made a distinction between the David of Israel's past and the David who was to come at the End of Days.171 This final perspective is perhaps operative in the Damascus Covenant, for in addition to the condemnation of the historical David found in CD 5:1—6, we find a curious expression of "Davidic hope" in the quo tation of Amos 9:11 found in CD 7:16-17: "And I will raise up the tab ernacle of David that is fallen . . . ."172 Despite the possibility of harmonization or conflation, it seems likely that the author of the prose note about David in 11Q Psalms3 was un aware of the negative evaluation given David by the author of the Da mascus Covenant. This prose note should probably be situated chron ologically between the production of 11Q Torah (which contains no di atribes against David) and the composition of the Damascus Covenant. 4. Beginning in column 18 and interspersed throughout the remain der of the scroll are a number of apocryphal or noncanonical compo sitions that have excited scholars since their publication. With some ex ceptions (to be discussed below) there are few explicit indications within these texts to suggest a sectarian provenance. Their absence from the traditional Psalter ipso facto places the composition of these psalms after the height of the shibat Zion movement of the Persian and early Hel lenistic periods, and are perhaps contemporaneous with certain other post-exilic noncanonical psalms recently published by E. Schuller.'73 It was noted above that the prose note about David's literary activity indicates an acquaintance with the calendrical system featured in the Book of Jubilees and 11Q Torah. Unfortunately scholars cannot agree upon a feasible date for either of these compositions, and such disagree ment inhibits attempts to date 11Q Psalms3 relative to these works. The most famous collection of sectarian hymns, the so-called Hodayot, exhibit a characteristic form and content that finds few parallels in this scroll's (171) Note 4Q161 (= 4Qplsaa) fragments 7-10, column iii 22-23: [פשרי על צמח1 דויד העומד נאזז[וית הימים] (reading the restorations of A.M. Habermann, Megillot midbar yehudah [Tel Aviv, 1959], 151). (172) Although it is true that this expression of "Davidic hope" is limited to the citation of the proof-text, the possibility of a linkage of this text with the advent of an eschatological David is verified from 4Q Florilegium 1:11-13: 1 1 הואה צמח דויד העומד עם דורש התורה אשי .(Amos 9:11) בצי[ון בא]חדית הימים כאשר כתוב . . .

Polzin, "Notes on the Dating of the Non-Massoretic Psalms of 11QPsa," HTR 60(1967)468-475, who situates them in the "late Persian/ Hellenistic" period.</page><page sequence="43">[431 david's eschatological psalter 65 noncanonical works.'74 One then should presumably date the material in the scroll between the time of Jubilees-11Q Torah and the Hodayot. I have argued elsewhere that Jubilees and 1 tQ Torah were written by a single author and should be dated to the latter part of the third cen tury b.c.e., or at the latest, around 200 b.c.e.'75 The Hodayot are gen erally placed in the first century b.c.e. 176 Thus the apocryphal com positions included in 11Q Psalms3 probably antedate the rise of the clas sical sectarian texts, but postdate proto-sectarian works such as Jubilees and 11Q Torah. Viewing the noncanonical hymns contained in the scroll as a whole, Psalm 151A-B appears to be the oldest composition, and the Hymn to the Creator, the youngest. The relative antiquity of Psalm 151 becomes manifest when we consider its complex history. The composition sur vives in divergent form in Greek, Syriac, several dependent versions, and now Hebrew. Two questions emerge regarding this divergence. How does the Hebrew version of this psalm relate to the Greek and Syriac translations, and what is the exact relationship between Psalm 151 and the other poems reproduced in 11Q Psalms3? The basic position of Sanders with regard to the first query is that the Septuagint and Syriac versions reproduce a paraphrase based upon a Hebrew Urtext. Sanders considers whether the text represented in our scroll was this Urtext, and concludes that it was, arguing that the Sep tuagint translator fused and truncated what was originally two separate works in Hebrew into one composition. For Sanders, the version of Psalm 151 contained in the scroll represents the earliest available witness to this work.'77 It seems unlikely, however, as suggested above, that the Greek or Syr iac versions of Psalm 151 are descendants of the Hebrew text represent ed in 11Q Psalms3. It would appear instead that these later recensions reflect a Hebrew archetype substantially different from the text con tained in the scroll. This hypothetical "original" text possessed three themes: 1) David's watchful care over his father's flocks; 2) David's anointment; and 3) David's slaying of Goliath. The Hebrew text of 11Q Psalms3 and the later Greek and Syriac recensions alter and expand these themes in different ways. The revision of this hypothetical Urtext (174) Sanders, Cornell, 11, and "Psalms Scroll Reviewed" (cf. n.4 above), 88. (175) See n.59 above. (176) Cf. D. Dimant, "Qumran Sectarian Literature," in M.E. Stone (ed.), Jewish Writ ingsings (see n.125 above), 522-524, for discussion and bibliography. (177) Sanders, DJD IV, 59-61, and Cornell, 94-98. M.

It can be read as a poetic version of the literary-historical events described in 1 Samuel 16—17. At the same time, however, it points to future Davidic deeds of deliverance, provided we interpret the references to victory over wild beasts and adversaries like Goliath as ciphers for the eventual deliver ance of Israel from pagan enemies. This futuristic orientation is strengthened by the ascription of this psalm to David ben Jesse. The Hebrew Vorlage of the Greek and Syriac versions of Psalm 151 may have been among the oldest psalms composed after the canoniza tion of the 150 compositions that make up the Book of Psalms. It would seem that Psalm 151 was originally intended to respond to a general concern regarding the Davidic authorship of the Psalter: If David was indeed the author of the Book of Psalms, why are there so few auto biographical references in his oeuvre ? The superscription assured the reader that its Davidic character need not be questioned despite its ex elusion from the accepted collection. The subsequent production of ad ditional apocryphal psalms required no equivalent assurance, as the peo pie gradually grew accustomed to the "discovery" of new Davidic hymns. Therefore the original Hebrew version of Psalm 151 probably dates from early in the Persian period not long after the "closure" of the tra ditional Psalter. The revised Hebrew text that appears in 11Q Psalmsa was probably composed around 200 b.c.e.,'78 and both Hebrew versions apparently circulated independently for some time. Comment upon Psalm 151 has focused upon the possibility of Orphic themes within its text.179 The convincing reading of the relevant lines proposed by J. Strugnell180 disposes of the arguments of those who see Hellenistic influence at work here. There is no clear evidence in any Qumran text published to date of Hellenistic influence upon the Qumran sectarians. Nothing in Psalm 151 argues against its placement in the early Persian period.181 (178) F.M. Cross, "David, Orpheus, and Psalm 151:3-4," BASOR 231(1978)70 dates Psalm 151 to the Persian period, no later than the third century b.c.e.

Noth ing remains of this theme in the extant versions of the psalm. However, there is a composition designated Psalm 152 (Syriac Psalm IV), surviving only in Syriac, that is devoted to David's encounters with wild beasts that threatened to ravage the flocks.183 11Q Psalms3 does not contain a copy of this psalm, but it might possibly have been featured at the end of column 28 as a third strophe of Psalm 151, to which we might accord the designation C. Moreover there is another composition, the so-called Psalm 153 (Syriac Psalm V), that reproduces a thanksgiving psalm uttered by David expressing his gratitude to God for saving him from the attacks of the wild beasts.184 There would not be enough room for this psalm at the bottom of column 28 (if we place the hypothetical Psalm 151C = Psalm 152 there), but it can comfortably be integrated in other places in the scroll. The most likely spot is at the bottom of column 17, after the replication of Psalm 145 with its added refrain of 185.ברוך יי וברוך שמו לעולם ועד One should note that this refrain bears some resemblance to the first line of Psalm 153: "praise the Lord, all you na tions; glorify Him and bless His name."186 Psalm 155 (Syriac Psalm III) is a broken acrostic composition intro duced by Psalm 144 and followed by Psalms 142-143. It pleads for grace and compassion in view of the fact that no human can appear as totally just before God. The vocabulary and structure of the psalm are rem iniscent of certain canonical compositions (e.g., Psalm 142) that treat of the same theme, but its closest analogues appear to be some of the non canonical psalms recently published by E. Schuller.187 Schuller describes the works she has edited as emanating from the Persian or early Hel lenistic periods.188 Since there is nothing characteristically sectarian about Psalms 154 and 155, a pre-Qumran origin is very likely.189 Archaeology Archaeology and Christian Humanism (New York, NY, 1964), 35 n.66 and BASOR 182(1966)54. (182) Sanders has considered this possibility; cf. ZAW 75(1963)74-75. It has often been observed that whereas Syriac Psalm 151 derives from the Septuagint, Syriac Psalms 152-155 were translated directly from Hebrew archetypes. See Strugnell, HTR 59(1966)259, and passim. (183) Translations conveniently available in Sanders, Cornell, 142 and OTP II, 616. (184) Cf. Sanders, Cornell, 142, and OTP II, 617.

This ascription contradicts what is said about the production of Psalms 154 and 155 in their Syriac superscriptions, where both are attributed to Hezekiah.'9° J.H. Charlesworth is inclined to ig nore these later attributions since they are represented by only one man uscript and are, in his words, "very late."191 It is unlikely, however, that a subsequent editor would have invented such a heading on his own. All of the superscriptions for the canonical Hebrew Psalms date back to the Second Temple period, if not earlier.192 We already know that the compiler of 11Q Psalms3 or his source did not hesitate to alter some of the headings he found. Therefore it seems likely that the Hebrew versions of the superscriptions represented in Syriac Psalms 154 and 155 were changed by the compiler of the Qumranic scroll. Unfortunate ly the section that would have contained a heading for Psalm 154 has been lost, and this situation impedes a clear solution of the problem. Regardless of all earlier or later attributions, the compiler of the scroll definitely viewed both psalms as Davidic compositions. This indicates that the Hebrew Vorlage of the Syriac versions antedates the Hebrew texts contained in 11Q Psalms3. In short, Psalms 154 and 155 originated during the Persian or early Hellenistic periods and were later modified by an editor responsible for the form of the texts in the scroll. Also represented in the scroll is the Hebrew text of Ben Sira 51 verses 13 to 20, and the final two words of verse 30. What makes this newly recovered version so interesting is its substantial divergence in places from the previously known recensions.193 This divergence suggests that the Greek edition of Ben Sira was based upon a Hebrew Vorlage that differed from the version contained in this scroll. Unfortunately the Cai ro text is of little help at this point, for the section that contains this canticle is particularly corrupt.194 Complicating the testimony of the Cai ro text is the virtual certainty that the medieval Hebrew version of this (Cornell,(Cornell, 11).

Priority should probably be accorded to the archetype of the Greek translation. A further important issue regarding this hymn is its traditional af filiation with the Book of Ben Sira. As Sanders has noted, the very près ence of this hymn in a collection whose contents were ostensibly au thored by David proves that this composition was originally independ ent of Ben Sira and was attached to that work at a later date.197 Ap parently the compiler of 11Q Psalms3 interpreted this sapiential hymn as an autobiographical account of the king's encounter with the charms of hokhmah, a term which should probably be interpreted as a metaphor for Torah. The Plea for Deliverance is a previously unknown composition that contains some biblical paraphrases, but seems to have particularly close connections with Psalm 151. The first few lines of the Plea ("Surely a maggot cannot praise thee nor a grave-worm recount thy loving kindness. But the living can praise thee, (even) all those who move can laud thee . . [Sanders]) recall Psalm 151:3 ("The mountains cannot witness to him nor the hills proclaim about him, (nor) the trees (pro claim) his words nor the flocks his deeds" [Strugnell]). The central idea that only a human being, in this case David, can properly praise God, is also similar. One should also compare verse 17 of the Plea ("Let my brothers rejoice with me and the house of my father, those who are dejected . . .") with the analogous mention of the brethren and father of David in Psalm 151:1,5-6. This plea for forgiveness was doubtless to be interpreted along autobiographical lines in consonance with the (1g5) See P.W. Skehan-A.A.

As suggested above, perhaps this composition refers to the Uriah affair also mentioned in the Damascus Covenant (CD 5:5-6). All that can be said regarding the date of this composition is that it is evidently dependent upon Psalm 151. Jewish liturgies for almost every occasion include a paragraph that pleads for the restoration of Zion. 11Q Psalms3 proves to be no excep tion in this regard, for it includes a splendid acrostic hymn that Sanders has called Apostrophe to Zion. This hymn features verbal and thematic links with certain passages of Deutero-Isaiah,'98 and may owe its genesis to the mournful tradition of Psalm 137. This composition differs, how ever, from similar post-exilic consolations of Zion in that it seems to ad dress Zion with almost divine attributes. The only reference to God in the entire hymn occurs in the shin verse ("praise the Most High, thy redeemer"), and there the name Qelyon is used! The seeming identifi cation of Zion with God need not be taken literally. It should be con sidered a species of poetic extension. Rather striking about the Apostrophe is the impression one gains that the exile of Zion has not ended, at least in the mind of its author. Note in particular verse 2: "Great is thy hope, O Zion: that peace and thy longed-for salvation will come." Verse 9 refers to those who mourn for Zion. Again and again redemption is pictured as a wish or expectation, rather than as an accomplished fact. All of this suggests that the poem's author viewed Israel as still residing under the pain of the galut. Chron ologically speaking, this is quite unlikely. Rather, the author of the Apos trophe believed that Israel was still in exile despite the restoration of the Temple and the physical return from Mesopotamia. For him the final redemption of the Holy City remained an unfulfilled vision of the earlier prophets. He probably regarded the Second Temple with a sus picious eye, preferring to await the promised action of God to restore His nation Himself. This position displays similarity to sectarian or proto-sectarian ideology.1" Sectarian motifs also appear in the poetic colophon to the scroll in what is called the Hymn to the Creator. From the perspective of poetic beauty, this composition is inferior to the Apostrophe to Zion, and is formed largely of a series of biblical citations and paraphrases.20" P.W. Skehan has noted that one passage of this Hymn is reproduced in Ju bilees 2:3 "and thereupon we saw his works, and praised him . . .," to (198) Sanders, DJD IV, 85, and Cornell, 123.

The function of the line in the Hymn is unclear. It seems more likely that the author of the Hymn borrowed this phrase from Jubilees, than the converse sug gested by Skehan. The composition of this Hymn would thus postdate that of Jubilees. Such dependence upon Jubilees would also be chron ologically consistent with the use of the Jubilean calendar in the prose note describing David's literary productivity. Final Observations 1 11Q Psalms3 consists of forty-one canonical psalms (forty-two if Psalm 100 indeed began the scroll, as argued above) and eight apocryphal compositions. Of the canonical inclusions, all but one (Psalm 93) stem from the last third of the traditional Psalter. As far as we can tell, the total number of compositions in these two collections is roughly equal. It stands to reason, therefore, that the traditional length of the final third of the Psalter (Psalms 101-150) may have influenced the length of the scroll. Certain of the canonical components of this final section of the Book of Psalms were replaced by the apocryphal additions. Both the texts included in the scroll, and particularly the prose com mentary that appears near the end of the scroll, draw special attention to the paramount role of David in the composing and ordering of psalm ic worship. The use of the patronymic "ben Jesse" seems to indicate that the historical monarch who bore this name was not the primary referent of that designation. Rather, it would seem that the designation "David ben ben Jesse " refers to an idealized future deliverer who would lead Israel at the End of Days. Some features of this idealized portrait can be seen in the Books of Chronicles, but there the image of David is still in a transitional phase between the poles of history and fantasy. 11Q Psalms3 retains this mixture, but places its emphasis upon the future expectation. An essential component of the future expectation is that this "second David" will compose a fantastic number of psalms and hymns to be em (201) Skehan, CBQ 37(&gt;975)343-347• (202) Skehan operates with a dating for Jubilees that places the composition of that work near the end of the second century b.c.e.

This emerges clearly from the prose commentary, which provides details regarding the structure of this ser vice. The liturgical features characterizing 11Q Psalms3 suggest that the scroll was viewed as a part of this eschatological collection of praise. The compiler was presenting a hallelujah for the End of Days that was at tributed to David ben Jesse. Choral responses, the exalted place of Psalm 118, and the careful arrangement (or even creation) of hallelujahs com prise only a part of the liturgical emphases visible in the scroll. Partie ularly important is its demonstrable dependence upon the cultic calen dar espoused by the Book of Jubilees and 11Q Torah. This indicates that the final compilation of the scroll took place during the first half of the second century b.c.e., not long after the appearance of the latter proto-sectarian works. Dependence upon Jubilees and 11Q Torah might be illustrated even further when we survey the conceptual structure of 11Q Psalms3. This scroll relates to the traditional Book of Psalms as Jubilees does to Genesis 1—Exodus 15, and as 11Q Torah does to the remainder of the Penta teuch. While some scribes were content to reproduce the text of the traditional Torah, others were actively preparing a new version appar ently more suited for the eschatological age. Similarly the traditional text of Psalms was rearranged and supplemented with an eye to its ev entual utility in the eschatological Temple. This recurrent combination of the old and the new may serve as a metaphor for Qumranic scribal activity as a whole. חדש ימינו כקדם (Lamentations 5:21).</page></plain_text>
