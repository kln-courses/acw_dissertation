<plain_text><page sequence="1">Of Rattles and Rituals The Anthropomorphic Rattle from the Nelson Glueck Collection at the Cincinnati Art Museum Nili S.Fox, Angela R.Roskop Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion In 1961, Nelson Glueck donated to the Cincinnati Art Museum a large female ceramic figurine which he had obtained in northern Transjordan. Only recentiy it was discov ered that this figurine is a rattle. The fact that the rattle is anthropomorphic, coupled by its uncommonly large size for a rattle, renders the artifact unique. Unfortunately, the anthropomorphic rattle is unprovenanced. Nevertheless, after confirming its authenticity by thermoluminescence analysis, the authors undertook a search to identify the iconographie tradition and functional context of this artifact. The inquiry includes a brief study of extant rattle-type instruments from the ancient Near East and their cultural significance. A detailed evaluation of the Glueck anthropomorphic rattle, especially its iconography, has led the authors to assign it to an Iron 11 Edomite cultural milieu, specifically to a religious context. The rattle-figurine probably stood in a local shrine and functioned in cult ritual as a musical instrument and possibly as a representation of a goddess. On the occasion of the 125th anniversary of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, it is fitting to dedicate a paper to the memory of one of the College's most distinguished past presidents. Dr. Nelson Glueck is widely rec ognized among archaeologists and biblical scholars for his extensive contribu tions to biblical archaeology. In the course of Glueck's explorations in northern Transjordan, he obtained a ceramic figurine in the village of Sabkhah. Glueck identified this figurine, shaped like a nude female, as an Iron II "Astarte" type, noting its unique qualities : "I know of no other Astarte figurine just like it or of comparatively large size."1 He published photos of the artifact in AASOR (1951) and in his book Rivers in the Desert{ 1959)? It was displayed at the Gemeente museum in the Netherlands in 1954 as part of an exhibition of ancient Israelite 1 Unpublished letter accompanying Glueck's gift of the figurine to the Cincinnati Art Museum (addressed to the museum director, Philip Adams, April 7,1961). 2 Nelson Glueck, Explorations in Eastern Palestine IV, Part I, AASOR 25-28 (New Haven : ASOR, 1951) 20 fig. 13 ; Nelson Glueck, Rivers in the Desert: A History of the Negev (New York: Farrar, Straus, and Cudahy, 1959) 117 fig. 19.</page><page sequence="2">NILI S.

This feature, recendy discovered while preparing a sample from the figurine for thermoluminescence analysis, amplifies the uniqueness of the piece. It raises the following questions: Do other anthropomorphic ratties exist? Does this rattle-figurine fit into an identifiable iconographie tradition? What can we surmise about its chronological, geographic, and functional contexts? These questions guide the following brief study. The Glueck Anthropomorphic Rattle The Glueck anthropomorphic ratde (figs. 1-3) has a cylindrical torso and legs. The breasts and arms were modeled separately and attached; the arms are now broken off. The back side of the torso is sculpted to show the small of the back and the upper part of the buttocks. An opening representing the vagina serves as the sound hole for the rattle. The legs are hollow, possibly to accommodate wooden pegs upon which the ratde may have rested when not in use.5 The head is formed in detail: the face has a pointed chin with clearly incised eyes and mod eled ears, nose, and mouth; corked curls or braids are styled all around the head. The ratde has a smooth conical top. Pieces of shell and a round ceramic pellet about 2 cm in diameter can be seen inside. The figurine ranges in width from 8.60 cm to 15.5 cm, in depth from 5.13 cm to 9.88 cm, and is 32.5 cm in height.6 Claims that it was found in Dhibîn, north of the Syrian border, cannot be sub stantiated, rendering the Glueck ratde unprovenanced.7 Its authenticity, however, has been confirmed by thermoluminescence analysis, which provided a date between 1300 and 100 b.c.e. for the firing of the object.8 Our goal in this paper is to go beyond these few facts. We will attempt, first, to place the ratde-figurine in an iconographie tradition and, second, to suggest how and in what contexts it may have been used. 3 Vit het Land van de Bijbel(The Hague: Gemeentemuseum, 1954) pl.56. 4 We gratefully acknowledge the Cincinnati Art Museum for permission to publish this artifact, particularly the cooperation and invaluable advice of Dr. Glenn Markoe, Curator of Classical and Near Eastern Art. 5 Vassos Karageorghis,personal communication May 31,2000. 66 Measurements to two decimal points were taken with a caliper, those to one decimal point with a tape. 7 Glueck, Eastern Palestine IV, Part 1,22 fig. 13. 8 The thermoluminescence analysis was performed on sample no.Ntooa24 on January 17,2000 by Doreen Stoneham of Oxford Authentication Ltd.

FOX, ANGELA R.ROSKOP 6 The Glueck Anthropomorphic Rattle IN ITS ICONOGRAPHIC tradition The Glueck rattle as a unit lacks a close parallel. Nevertheless, other artifacts do exist which exhibit similarities to specific features, namely the torso, legs, and arms; facial features; hairstyle; and conical top. Our search for parallels will focus on the eastern Mediterranean and Levant — the rattle's presumed cultural context — in an attempt to isolate a particular iconographie tradition into which it might fit. Many features of the Glueck rattle have parallels in figurines from two sites in the Negev, Horvat Qitmit9 and 'En Hazeva.10 The material culture at these two sites is generally considered "Edomite," although they are not in Edom proper. Some debate as to the nature of cultural influence, however, persists. Itzhaq Beit Arieh, the senior excavator at Qitmit, suggests that Edom dominated the area toward the end of the 6th century b.c.e.11 Rudolf Cohen and Yigal Israel, the senior excavators at Hazeva, however, reject the notion of Edomite political control in the Negev and suggest instead that economic influence explains the presence of Edomite material culture at these sites.12 Edomites living in the Negev may also have been a conduit for cultural influence.13 Scholars generally agree, however, that there is Edomite influence on the material culture of these sites. The figurines have features which can be linked to non-Judahite Levantine ico nography in general, but certain features are also found on pottery from Edom proper.14 This similarity, combined with the presence of the divine name Qos, the national god of Edom, in paléographie material from the Negev, has led Pirhiya Beck to conclude that the figurines represent an Edomite artistic style.15 While 9 Itzhaq Beit-Arieh,"New Light on the Edomites," BAR 14/2 (March/April 1988) 40 and Pirhiya Beck, "Catalogue of Cult Objects and Study of the Iconography," in I.Beit-Arieh, ed.,Horvat Qitmit: An EdomiteEdomite Shrine in the Biblical Negev, Tel Aviv University Institute of Archaeology Monograph Series 11 (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Univ.

Israel Finkelstein also argues that economic factors — particularly trade routes to the Arabian peninsula — explain the presence of Edomite material culture in the Negev, particularly at Qitmit ("Horvat Qitmit and the Southern Trade in the Late Iron Age II," ZDPVZDPV108 [1992] 156-170). 13 See Itzhaq Beit-Arieh,"Edomites Advance into Judah,"BAR 22/6 (November/December 1996) 35, and Beck, "Catalog of Cult Objects," 189. 14 Cohen and Yisrael,"Smashing the Idols,"48. 15 Beck,"Catalog of Cult Objects,"189. Beck qualifies her case when she states,"The most perplexing problem however with regard to the suggested Edomite identity of the art of Horvat Qitmit is its almost total absence from the land of Edom itself" (Beck, "Catalog of Cult Objects," 190); i.e., the</page><page sequence="7">7 OF RATTLES AND RITUALS 11 recognizing the general Levantine iconographie influence on these artifacts, we accept Becks conclusion that they show an Edomite artistic tradition. TORSO, LEGS, AND ARMS The cylindrical torso of the Glueck rattle is similar to 7th century anthropo morphic cult stands from Qitmit and Hazeva. These cult stands consist of an inverted wheel-made jar-shape, the mouth of the jar forming the base of the stand; the head is formed separately and added on so that the base of the jar shape gives the appearance of shoulders. The rattle's stump legs, like the bases of the Edomite cult stands, are narrower than the torso.16 In contrast to the jar shaped cult stands, the Glueck rattle is contoured to depict the waist and back of a human figure. Unlike the cult stands, the heads of which were made separately and added, the rattle has no shoulders; the rattle's head is the same width as its torso. This characteristic suggests that the entire figurine — torso and head — may have been made as one piece. The broken arms of the Glueck rattle originally consisted of clay coils at tached to the torso. Their poor state of preservation, however, makes it difficult to reconstruct their position and gesture. The arms of the Edomite stands discussed above are coils of clay positioned close to the body and bent at the elbows; one holds a vessel. Several female figurines from Cyprus ranging in date from the 11th to the 7th centuries b.c.e. also have coil-made arms, but they are in an upraised position.17 The breakage on the left arm of an example from Old Paphos18 resembles the breakage on the right arm of the Glueck rattle, suggesting that the latter's arms were also extended outward, rather than held at the side as on the Edomite stands. The breasts on the anthropomorphic rattle are very small knobs of clay added to the wheel-made cylinder. The Cypriot figurines with uplifted hands men tioned above exhibit the same feature.19 This method of representing breasts argument that these figurines are Edomite hinges on the similarity of a few specific features to Edomite material culture rather than a full parallel in Edom. 16 The two stump legs on the cylindrical torso are parallel to those of a figure in a window or niche de picted in a relief from Kouklia in Cyprus (Franz Georg Maier, Alt-Paphos auf Cypern, Ausgrabungen zurzur Geschichte von Stadt und Heiligtum 1966-1984 [Mainz on the Rhine: Verlag Philipp von Zabern, 1985]pl-10:5). 17 See, for example, Vassos Karageorghis, Cyprus from the Stone Age to the Romans (London: Thames and Hudson, 1982) fig. 88 ;Vassos Karageorghis, The Ancient Civilization ofCyprus (New York: Cowles Education Corporation, 1969) pi. 101; and Vassos Karageorghis, Ancient Cyprus: 7,000 Years of Art &amp; Archaeology &amp; Archaeology (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State Univ.

FOX, ANGELA R. ROSKOP 8 stands in stark contrast to breasts on Judahite pillar figurines, which are also added to the torso but are commonly larger and supported by the hands. The difference in representation is probably rooted in iconography, not in artistic convention. Breasts are the focal point of the Judahite pillar figurines — probably representing the idea of lactation — while the gesture of the hands — represent ing supplication, prayer, or blessing — is the focus of the Cypriot figurines, and possibly the Glueck rattle as well. FACIAL FEATURES The Glueck rattle's facial features have geographically and chronologically wide ranging parallels, particularly in Cypriot and Edomite material culture. The horned head from Horvat Qitmit20 is especially significant in this regard. Fea tures on the Qitmit head and other Edomite figurines are either incised or mod eled separately and applied to the head,21 as are the features on the Glueck rattle. Both the Qitmit head and the Glueck rattle have a pointed chin. The incised, asymmetrical, almond-shaped eyes on the rattle are strikingly similar to those on the Qitmit head;22 traces of painted pupils are visible on the head, but not on the rattle.23 Both the ratde and the head have the same prominent triangular nose with elongated nostrils. The horizontal, open, full-lipped mouth of the Glueck rattle is similar to a mouth on a face fragment from Horvat Qitmit;24 the mouth on the Qitmit head, although smiling, also has an open mouth and prominent lower lip. This combination of features bears a striking resemblance to three cast bronze statues, two male25 and one female,26 from the 13th/12th century "ingot god" sanctuary at Enkomi on Cyprus. Similar facial features continue to be modeled on Magenta Ware vases dating to the late 3rd-early 1st centuries b.c.e. from Cyprus,27 but in a style distinct from that of Bronze and Iron Age examples. HAIRSTYLE The long corked curls or braids on the Glueck rattle have parallels throughout the eastern Mediterranean and Levant. A 12th century cast bronze statue found 20 Beck,"Catalogue of Cult Objects," 78-80 figs.3.53-55 and 83 fig.3.56. 21 Beck, "Catalogue of Cult Objects,"45. 22 The eyes on some of the Edomite cult stands are applied rather than incised, although they are still the same basic shape and some are asymmetrical. See Cohen and Yisrael, On the Road to Edom, 24. 23 An ultraviolet scan, conducted in the conservation laboratory of the Cincinnati Art Museum by Stephen Bonadies, revealed no traces of paint on the rattle. 24 Beck,"Catalogue of Cult Objects," 76 fig.3.50 and 82 fig.3.28. 25 Tatton-Brown, Ancient Cyprus, 63 fig. 69 and Kargeorghis, Cyprus from the Stone Age, 102 fig. 78. 26 Karageorghis, Ancient Cyprus:7,000 Years, fig.72. 27 Demetrios Michalides,"Magenta Ware in Cyprus Once More" in V.

The hairstyle on the Glueck rattle features a full head of such curls or braids. CONICAL TOP The top on the Glueck rattle is conical in shape with a concave rim which sits on the head. Its shape could indicate a headdress similar to that worn by a number of Cypriot and Levantine figurines. In Cyprus, a stout cap is worn by both male and female figurines.32 Levantine examples include a number of plaque figurines (probably male) from a tomb at the Amman Citadel,33 female figurines from Tell el-Judeideh,34and a pillar figurine from Ugarit.35The head from Horvat Qitmit has a conical "crown"; three horns protruding from its head identify it as a deity.36 Pirhiya Beck, in the publication of Horvat Qitmit, compares the shape of this "crown" to rattles from Palestine37 (fig. 4 a). Joachim Braun, in his recent work on ancient Israelite music, also notes the similarity in shape. He argues further that the Qitmit head may have had a handle attached where the neck is broken and, therefore, was actually a rattle, reminiscent of a Hathor-headed sistrum.38 The conical top on the Glueck rattle is also similar in International International Conference on Cypriot Studies, Nicoisia,3~4 May, 1996 (Brussels: A.G.Leventis Foun dation,dation, 1997) pis. xliv-xlvii. 28 Karageorghis, Ancient Cyprus: 7,000 Years, 95 fig.72. 29 Herbert Gordon May and Robert M.

In both cases, it may identify the piece as a rattle and function as a headdress.43 The data presented above demonstrate that close parallels exist for individual features of the Glueck rattle — torso, facial features, hair, breasts, and arms. Some of these, such as the facial features, are attested over long periods of time, but, in general, the parallels are concentrated in the Late Bronze and Iron Ages. Despite the fact that parallels to individual features of the Glueck rattle can be found from Cyprus and throughout the Levant, the best evidence comes from Negev sites influenced by Edomite, rather than Judahite, material culture. The figurines from Horvat Qitmit and 'En Hazeva — particularly the horned head from Qitmit — most closely parallel the Glueck rattle in that every feature of the rattle (except the breasts44) is found in Edomite iconography. Thus the Glueck rattle may belong to an Iron 11 Edomite cultural milieu. Rattle-type Instruments and Their Contexts A number of intact rattles have been uncovered in archaeological excavations in the eastern Mediterranean and the ancient Near East; unfortunately many lack vergleichendenvergleichenden Quellen, OBO 164 (Gôttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1999) 195. The fact that the Glueck rattle depicts the entire body raises the possibility that the Qitmit head, if in fact it was a rattle, also had a body rather than a handle. 39 R.A.S.

J.H.Iliffe("A Model Shrine of Phoenician Style," QDAP 11 [1945] 91-92 and pi. xxi) suggests that this projection is a handle, although it may be too small to function as such. Beck ("Catalogue of Cultic Objects," 121) compares the shape of the Qitmit head's "crown" to this projection as well as to rattles from Palestine, as dis cussed above. It is possible that the knob-like projection on this shrine could be understood in connection with rattles as well. 44 No Edomite figurines are clearly female; therefore it is unknown how breasts would have been depicted.</page><page sequence="12">16 NILI S. FOX, ANGELA R. ROSKOP 12 a clear context. Fortuitously, a few painted, inlaid, and carved scenes, as well as texts, predominately from Egypt and to a lesser degree from Mesopotamia and the Aegean, depict the uses and cultural contexts of ratde-type instruments. In our attempt to determine how and in what contexts the Glueck rattle may have been used, we will examine artifacts, scenes, and texts pertaining to sistra and ceramic rattles. SISTRA The oldest and most widely attested ratde-type instrument from the ancient Near East is the sistrum (Greek seistron), an instrument with moveable parts on a frame — either movable rods or rods threaded with rings or discs — which produce sound when shaken.45Although its shape differs totally from that of closed-form rattles, the sistrum operates in a similar manner and is generally classified as a rattling idiophone, an instrument made from naturally sonorous material. Evidence of sistra is extant from Mesopotamia?6 Egypt?7Anatolia,18 and southern Canaan. 45 For a comprehensive study of sistra, see Bertil Soderberg,"The Sistrum," £t/mos 32 (1968) 90-133. It should be noted that these type of instruments are found worldwide. 46 At present, it cannot be determined whether the sistrum originated in Egypt or Mesopotamia and was transmitted from one region to the other, or whether it was invented independently at different sites. The earliest datable examples of sistra are Sumerian in origin. Sistra are absent from later Babylonian and Assyrian cultural remains, although other percussion instruments such as bells, cymbals, and a few ceramic rattles are attested (Henry G. Farmer, "The Music of Ancient Mesopo tamia," The New Oxford History of Music [10 vols.; London: Oxford Univ. Press, 1957-74] 1:239 40). The seemingly short-lived popularity of the sistrum in Mesopotamia may explain the absence of an identifiable Sumerian or Akkadian term for the instrument in the written record. Farmer speculates that the term si-qa-tu in the title of a Sumerian psalm (KAR158 r. viii 37) may designate a a rattle-type of musical instrument (Farmer, "Music of Ancient Mesopotamia," 1:240 n.2).The meaning of this term, however, remains enigmatic {CAD SII I: 100-01), since it is attested only once, in this text as a type of song not necessarily named after a musical instrument, let alone a rattle. Adam Falkenstein translates the term gishar-har (read harharri) as "sistrum" in a Sumerian hymn (Adam Falkenstein and Wolfram von Soden, Sumerische und Akkadische Hymnen und GebeteGebete [Zurich: Artemis-Verlag, 1953] 135), but the term refers to some kind of stringed instrument, although nothing in this context suggests that it designates a sistrum in particular (see CAD H: 100). 47 Evidence from Egypt spans a far longer time frame, in the Pharaonic period from the 6 th to the 3 0 th Dynasties. Beginning in the Middle Kingdom, two distinct terms distinguish two varieties of sistra regularly attested in texts: shm designates the older version of the sistrum, which is bow-shaped and made of wood or ceramic; sss refers to the later rendition, constructed of metal and some times called a naos sistrum due to its shrine-like shape. Each type is rendered by a distinct hiero glyphic determinative, although the two are occasionally interchanged (Adolf Erman and Hermann Grapow, Worterbuch der agyptischen Sprache, 4:251-52,486-87; Soderberg,"The Sistrum,"91; Chris tiane Ziegler,"Sistrum," in LÀ 5:959-63; and Farmer,"Music of Ancient Mesopotamia," 1:267). 48 A bronze sistrum with a caprid motif was found in an Early Bronze Age tomb at Horoztepe. See</page><page sequence="13">13 OF RATTLES AND RITUALS 17 Musical ensembles in two artistic representations from Mesopotamia include sistra. A sistrum is depicted on a seal impression of the Agade Period (ca. 2500 b.c.e.),49 which shows a row of three musicians. One figure, identified as a deity by the rays emanating from its shoulders, sits on a lion throne before a drum shaped altar.50 A second figure playing a lyre and a third holding a sistrum sit facing the deity. Another sistrum is pictured on the inlay decoration of the Great Lyre from the king's tomb (tomb PG 789) at Ur(ca.2700 b.c.e.).51 Here the musicians are portrayed as animals (or costumed humans52) : an ass plucks a lyre, a bear standing nearby holds a beam of the lyre or another instrument, and a small animal, perhaps a fox, shakes a spur-shaped sistrum. This animal orchestra seems to accompany the funeral banquet portrayed on the panel in the register above.53 Besides the sistrum pictured on the lyre, remains of actual sistra were found in Queen Pu-Abi's tomb (tomb PG 800) and in another tomb (tomb PG 449 );54they may have been used in the funeral ritual. A biblical text depicting a musical ensemble marching in procession may include a reference to a rattle-type instrument. The term 55מנענעים is listed together with several musical instruments (2 Samuel 6:5) played in the festive procession led by David on the occasion of the transfer of the ark from Gibeah to Jerusalem. If מנענעים refers to a rattle-type instrument as inferred, then this text shows that rattles or sistra were used in processions involving celebration Tahsin Ozgùc and Mahmut Alok, "Horoztepe: Eski Tunç Devri Mezarlig ve Iskân Yeri (An Early Bronze Age Settlement and Cemetery)(' Turk Tarih Kurumu Yayinlarindan 5:18 (Ankara: Turk Tarih Kurumu Basimevi, 1958) 42,48-49, pi. xii. Three other unprovenanced sistra of a similar type are pictured on pi. xvm:1-3: these are assumed to be from Anatolia and to date to the Early Bronze Age. 49 Francis W.

In this instance, the celebration is connected with an important cult object — the ark — but there is no reason to assume that musical processions were exclusively cultic. In Egypt, the sistrum was associated with certain deities, primarily Hathor, the goddess of love, song, and dance. The cat-goddess Bastet, whose cult is connected with that of Hathor, is pictured on sistra or holding the instrument;56 nevertheless, it is Hathor's head which is most often depicted at the base of the sistrum above the handle, usually on a naos sistrum.57 Hathor herself is pictured holding a naos sistrum that displays her head, in reliefs from Egypt proper58 and Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai.59 It was believed that Hathor used her instrument as a medium for bestowing blessings on her devotees?0 The existence of fragile, glazed ceramic sistra decorated with royal dedicatory inscriptions indicates that this instrument was considered a proper royal votive gift to Hathor.61A number of these sistra have been discovered at Hathor temples, even at those outside of Egypt proper, such as the Late Bronze Age temples at Timna and Serabit el Khadim.62 The sistrum was not, however, limited to the service of Hathor. In fact, a number of queens and a few pharaohs are depicted bearing sistra when in the presence of other deities such as Amun, Osiris, and Isis.63 The predominance of females closely connected with the sistrum in the heavenly realm is reflected in the human realm. Women belonging to the royal household or priesthood, rather than men, generally played this instrument. In worship scenes from El -Amarna, Akhenaten's daughters are pictured with sistra, although the sistra are devoid of any Hathor images or symbols, no doubt in keeping with the ban on worship of deities other than the Aten.64 An important textual source which elucidates the function of the sistrum in Egypt is the Story of Sinuhe. It demonstrates that what initially may appear to be a secular act can in reality be cult ritual. Sistra are used in a palace performance staged by the royal children (possibly only the females65) on behalf of the aged 56 Henry G.

Importantly, the song chanted by the children is accompanied by musi cal instruments, all of which are emblems of the goddess Hathor: the bow shaped sistrum (shm), the naos sistrum (sss), and the mnjt-bead necklace. The song concludes with a petition for Sinuhe's freedom(II.269-279)?6Alan Gar diner observes in his commentary on Sinuhe that the purpose of the entertain ment, which he suggests included dance, was to mimic the goddess associated with these particular objects. He notes that participants in such performances undergo a ritual transformation: "the performer is Hathor, the goddess of song and dance, who bestows her favours on the prince before whom the perfor mance takes place."67 Just as Hathor is pictured in paintings offering her em blems as gifts of life, prosperity, and health to various pharaohs, so the children in Sinuhe "present" their necklaces to the king?8 While symbolic of Hathor and her gifts of good fortune, the sistra were also played for the power of their jingle to appease the gods' anger, in this case that of Pharaoh vis-à-vis Sinuhe.69 The popularity of the Egyptian sistrum as a percussion instrument employed in ritual is evident from its long-lived and widespread use. A Late Bronze Age bone handle of a sistrum, carved with a Hathor head, was found at Bethel in Canaan,70 and a bronze statue of Bastet from Ashkelon holding a sistrum is dated to the same period.71 By the second half of the first millennium the sistrum was disseminated throughout the Greek world, primarily through the Isis cult. In the Aegean and Europe it became an instrument associated with chthonic aspects of Hathor and Isis, thereby functioning mainly in mortuary rites.72 In his description of elements of the Isis cult adapted into Roman religion, Lucan describes the sistrum as iubentia luctus,"compelling grief."73 In sum, the data on sistra demonstrate that this rattle-type instrument was multi-vocal, playing a variety of roles in ritual. Sistra were played in musical ensembles and employed in funerary rites such as banquets.

It is noteworthy that sistra are associated primarily with women, both in terms of who played the instruments and which deities were affiliated with them. CERAMIC RATTLES In contrast to the sistrum common in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and later Aegean contexts, closed-form ceramic rattles are predominant in Bronze and Iron Age Palestine and, to a far lesser degree, in the Greco-Parthian period in Mesopota mia. Their use has been debated in publications since the end of the nineteenth century; theories offered at that time are still prevalent in the literature today. The two main theories hold that these rattles were used either as children's toys,74 as is common in modern western cultures, or in cult,75 reflecting the cross cultural, historical function of rattles in ritual.76 Specific ritual functions have been proposed, including dancing,77 fertility cult78 offerings for the dead,79 and to drive away evil spirits.80 Since most ceramic rattles are too large for a young child's hand81 and are breakable, the children's toy theory is less likely.82 Other 74 A view held by Bliss, Mound of Many Cities, 117; Frederick Jones Bliss,"Third Report on the Exca vations at Tell Zakariya," PEFQS(1899) 183; Bliss and Macalister, Excavations in Palestine, 96; Duncan Mackenzie, Excavations at Ain Shems (Beth-Shemesh ), Palestine Exploration Fund Annual 22 (London: Palestine Exploration Fund, 1912-1913) 89; and Eann Macdonald, J.L.Starkey, and Lank ester Harding, Beth-Pelet II (London: British School of Archaeology in Egypt, 1932) 23,25.

On the other hand, the various ritual explanations given in the literature, while plausible, are often vague and based on little direct evidence. Only a close examination of the rattles and the contexts in which they are found can result in more specific and better substanti ated conclusions about their functions. Based on a preliminary study of the closed-form ceramic rattles found in Palestine,83 we can make some further observations about different types. Barrel shaped rattles, the most common type, are grasped around the middle; most measure roughly 4 to 7 cm in diameter, a good size for an adult hand. Some examples have loop handles, while others have holes through knob-shaped handles and may have been suspended.84A rattle from Megiddo has a stick-like handle protruding from one end;85 it resembles a gourd rattle or a sistrum and was likely employed in much the same way. The user could have held any of these rattle types two at a time, one in each hand. Several ceramic rattles from Mesopotamia dating to the Greco-Parthian pe riod (ca. 200 b.c.e.-ioo c.e.) are similar in size to the rattles from Palestine and would also have been grasped in the hand. Like the Glueck ratde, some of these are anthropomorphic, in the form of a female bust. Two well-preserved rattles from Nippur depict women who may be musicians, since they press a round disc, perhaps a tambourine, to their breasts.86 Two others from Seleucia on the Tigris hold an object in each hand pressed to the breast.87 The objects held by one figurine are rounded but indistinguishable; the second figurine clasps a round object in one hand and a small bird in the other hand.88 Interestingly, a disc shaped ceramic rattle, perhaps signifying a tambourine, and a ceramic rattle in the shape of a bird are attested from Nippur.89 These artifacts raise the pos sibility that the objects held by the women pictured on the bust-shaped rattles 83 A full study of ceramic rattles from Palestine, their use, and possible foreign connections is cur rently being prepared by Angela Roskop. 84 E.g., Yigael Yadin et al., Hazor III-IV: An Account of the Third and Fourth Seasons of Excavations, 1957-19581957-19581957-1958 (2 vols.; Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1961) 2:pl.cc1.x1x:24.

FOX, ANGELA R. ROSKOP 18 are in fact rattle-type instruments. Although it is not clear whether the context is sacred or secular, these rattles also show that women played this instrument. A group of Aegean Late Geometric vases (8th-7th centuries b.c.e.90), named for its painted geometric designs, depicts what are commonly known as "rattle scenes." The identity of the gourd-shaped objects held by the people in these scenes, however, is debated. Are they perhaps pomegranate-shaped sprinklers, spindles, cymbals of sorts, or rattles? What kind of activity does the scene represent — perhaps a banquet or a funeral ritual?91 Recent opinion on the matter maintains that the objects are musical instruments — probably rattles, particularly since they appear to be swung or shaken vertically.92 The striking similarity between the ceramic rattle from Megiddo mentioned above and the instruments depicted in these scenes lends further support to their identifica tion as rattles. Since the vases themselves were created as funerary monuments and buried in tombs,93 the rattles in the Geometric vase scenes are thought to be used in funerary rituals. Their use in pairs corresponds with the probable method of playing ceramic rattles, two at a time, one in each hand. According to Eva Rystedt, the rattles are pictured on the vases in different scenes — some with two mourners seated on either side of a table, others with a single mourner seated in a chair. If Rystedt's interpretation is correct, these scenes imply that rattles had multiple uses during a funeral and were not connected to a single, specific ritual. The sound of the rattle could perhaps express mourning or drive away evil spirits, as appropriate to the ritual process at any given point. Thus, these rattling instruments, comparable to sistra in Egyptian ritual, can be described as multi-vocal, even within a single cultic context. A somewhat similar scene appears on a Neo-EIittite (Iron Age, 9th century b.c.e.) funerary stele, erected in honor of a deceased woman by her husband, from Mara?.94 Two women, presumably representing the deceased, are seated 90 J.N.Coldstream, Greek Geometric Pottery: A Survey of Ten Local Styles and their Chronology (London: Methuen,Methuen, 1968) 330. 91 See J. M.Cook,"A Geometric Graveside Scene" BCH 70 (1946) 97-101; Gudrun Ahlberg,"A Late Geometric Grave-scene Influenced by North Syrian Art," Opuscula Atheniensia 7 (1967) 177-86; John Boardman, "Attic Geometric Vase Scenes, Old and New,''JHS 86 (1966) 1-5 pls.1-1v; Sheila Mc Nally,"An Attic Geometric Vase in the Collection of Mt.

On the table are a goblet and flat objects, either plates or loaves of bread, suggesting a banquet scene. One of the women holds a mirror and the other holds a cup in one hand; in the other hand, each woman holds a gourd-shaped object similar in shape to those on the Late Geometric vase scenes. John David Hawkins identifies these objects as spindles, but they may in fact be rattles.95 Since the rattles and the mirror do not seem to fit the banquet context, it is likely that this scene telescopes various activities within a ritual. That the deceased is the subject of the scene implies that the ritual can be connected with her burial or was performed by her in the afterlife. The archaeological contexts of many rattles found in Palestine also suggest a funerary use for rattles. Although some rattles are from occupational contexts96 and two were found in the inner sanctum of shrine 2133 at Hazor,97 the majority of provenanced rattles are from tombs.98 Interestingly, a rattle was found in an Iron II tomb at Khirbet el-Qôm, where one of the famous "Asherah" inscriptions was incised into the wall.99 In this inscription, Asherah is addressed in a petition to deliver a man — presumably the occupant of the tomb — from his enemies.100 Although no evidence explicitly connects Asherah with the dead, this inscription reveals the belief that she had power to protect her devotees. Elizabeth Bloch Smith prompts us to understand burial goods "as cultural objects selected for 95 Hawkins,Corpus of Hieroglyphic Luwian Inscriptions, 273. The similarity between the gourd-shaped objects on the Maraç stele and the Late Geometric vase painting, and the similarity of both to the gourd-shaped rattle from Megiddo makes a strong case for these objects being rattles. In addition, however, it could be argued that the barrel-shaped ceramic rattles so common in Palestine are also in the shape of a spindle or spool; thus there may be some connection between the shape of a rattle and a spindle. Hawkins' observation concerning the spindle-shape of the objects is accurate, but he may not be correct about their identity. 96 Some of these are dump contexts and others are uncertain. The most certain examples are from area L at Tel 'Ira (Itzhaq Beit-Arieh, éd., Tel 'Ira: A Stronghold in the Biblical Negev, Tel Aviv Univer sity Institute of Archaeology Monograph Series 15 [Jerusalem: Institute of Archaeology, Tel Aviv Univ., 1999] 278 fig. 6.98 no. 12) and a courtyard at Hazor(Yadin, et al., Hazor II, pl.Lxxxvin: 18-19 «md pl.CLX1:15-16). Possibly the most uncertain example comes from Macalister's trench 28 at Gezer, which contains irretrievably mixed material(Macalister, Excavation of Gezer, 2:305 fig-445-3)• 97 Yadin et al., Hazor fff-/V,2:pl.cCLX1x:24-25. 98 Of the 74 ceramic rattles from Palestine known to the authors, 56 are from clear contexts.

FOX, ANGELA R. ROSKOP 20 inclusion among the limited mortuary repertoire to invoke sympathetic powers on behalf of the deceased and on behalf of their surviving family members."101 As Hathor was petitioned for blessing and/or protection in a ritual using a sistrum, perhaps rattles in Palestine functioned in a similar ritual associated with request for protection from Asherah or another deity — perhaps to awaken or arouse the deity.102 A jar-shaped anthropomorphic rattle from Tell el-Far'ah (South) was also found in a tomb context.103 Manfred Weippert incorrectly identifies this artifact as a gravidae flask, used to hold oil for healing the skin during pregnancy. Re jecting its identification as a rattle on the grounds that it is not like known rattles,104 Weippert overlooks a group of rattles from Palestine shaped like dip per juglets,105 very similar to a group of Cypriot rattles.106 Weippert's identifica tion of this artifact as a flask accounts for neither the sealed mouth, which would prevent it from being filled with any liquid, nor the pellets or stones 101 Bloch-Smith, Judahite Burial Practices, 94. Of those rattles from Iron II tomb contexts, a number were found with female figurines (e. g.,Mackenzie, Excavations at Ain Shems, pl.xxn:16; and Eilat Mazar and Benjamin Mazar, Excavations in the South of the Temple Mount: The Ophel of Biblical Jerusalem Jerusalem Qedem 29 [Jerusalem: Hebrew Univ., 1989] 52 photo 111 and pi. 29:5). Many scholars have associated these figurines with Asherah, although this association is not certain due to the lack of distinguishing iconography on the figurines. See the discussion and bibliography in Raz Kletter, The The Judean Pillar Figurines and the Archaeology of Asherah, BAR International Series 636 (Oxford: Tempus Reparatum, 1990) 76-77. Note, however, that Kletter concludes that the pillar figurines do represent Asherah (Kletter, Judean Pillar Figurines, 81). 102 Some scholars, including William G.Dever, posit that Asherah and Hathor should be equated ("Ash erah, Consort of Yahweh? New Evidence from Kuntillet Ajrud," BASOR 255 [1984] 29) ; this sugges tion builds on that of I. E. S. Edwards ("A Relief of Qudshu-Astarte-Anat in the Winchester College Collection,"Collection," JNES14 [1955] 49-51). Interestingly, just as Hathor is pictured with a sistrum, Asherah is depicted holding a plk in her right hand in the Ugaritic myth known as "The Palace of Baal" (CTA 4.U.3-4). Although the term plk plk means "spindle," in this text it may refer to the shape of the object rather than its identity. Like the gourd- or spindle-shaped objects on the Maraç stele and the Late Geometric vase scenes, it may be a rattle. 103 Macdonald, Starkey, and Harding, Beth-Pelet II, pl.XLVii. A round rattle from Gezer also has breasts, but no other human features (Macalister, Excavations at Gezer, 2:305 fig. 445.8). The latter may have had a head, made separately and attached, which is no longer extant. Macalister assumes that the head sat on the flat top of the rattle and was inserted into a small hole. 104 Manfred Weippert,"Kanaanàische ,Gravidenflaschen' Zur Geschichte einer âgyptischen Gefâflgat tung in der asiatischen ,Provinz,"' ZDPV 93 (1977) 272.

Nevertheless, we acknowledge the striking similarity between this rattle and the gravidae flasks flasks — particularly the breasts, the paunched abdomen suggesting pregnancy, and the apparent placement of the arms in a gesture of rubbing the abdomen. This similarity may point to a connection between this rattle and the idea of an afterlife often associated with funerary ritual in the ancient Near East.108 In sum, the available evidence suggests that rattles were used primarily in ritual, although not exclusively. The rattles found in domestic and public con texts support this qualification; these may have been used in musical ensembles, processions, or for dancing. Rattles such as the two found in the inner sanctum of shrine 2133 at Hazor were clearly used for official or public ritual or placed as votive offerings; these functions resemble the use of sistra in Egypt, particularly within temple contexts. The most common context of rattles, however, is within funerary ritual. But even within funerary cults, rattles could have been used in various ways: perhaps to rouse or awaken a deity, to express mourning, to drive away evil spirits, or in rituals connected with an afterlife. Conclusions The speculative nature of this study must be stressed again in conclusion. The Glueck rattle is an unprovenanced artifact for which there is no direct parallel. At the same time, its uniqueness as an anthropomorphic rattle, coupled with a positive test of authenticity, prompted this attempt to fit it into an iconographie tradition and to explore how and in what contexts it may have been used. We offer the following tentative conclusions. Parallels to the combination of features on the Glueck rattle suggest that it belongs to an Iron II Edomite cultural milieu. Yet the rattle-figurine remains unique in many respects. Its size is unequaled among anthropomorphic rattles and, in fact, among ratdes in general. Unlike the common ceramic ratdes which could be held one in each hand, the rattle-figurine's large size dictates that it be grasped with two hands in order to be sounded. This characteristic reflects a 107 Braun (Die Musikkultur Altisraels, 94) makes the same observations. 108 Note that some symbols, such as the vulture in ancient Egypt, are associated with death, rebirth, and fertility (A.DeVries, Dictionary of Symbols and Imagery [Amsterdam: Elsevier, 1976] 490).

ROSKOP 22 more ceremonial than practical function. As further support for a ceremonial context, the hollow legs of the rattle-figurine suggest that it was displayed when not in use, perhaps on wooden pegs inserted in a stand. The design of the Edomite anthropomorphic incense stands from the shrine at 'En Hazeva also may indicate a ritual context for the Glueck ratde. These stands appealed to multiple senses, providing olfactory and visual stimuli. So too, the Glueck rattie would have appealed to multiple senses, serving as an auditory as well as visual stimulus within a cult setting. Furthermore, the use of musical instruments in Edomite cult — as it is represented at Horvat Qitmit and 'En Hazeva — is demonstrated by the presence of a figurine playing a doublepipe, and clay models of tambourines and a lyre.109 It is significant that the female gender of the Glueck ratde parallels that of all other known anthropomorphic ratdes from Palestine, Mesopotamia, and Egypt. In the Egyptian examples, the representations on the instruments are portraits of goddesses. Is the female depicted on the Glueck rattle a goddess as well? The horned deity head from Horvat Qitmit, which may have been a rattle, is similar to the ratde-figurine on many counts. Might the Glueck figurine, which is clearly a ratde, also represent a deity? This question is impossible to answer with certainty, given that the Glueck ratde lacks distinctive iconographie features particular to a known deity. Nevertheless, evidence which places it in a ritual context strengthens the argument that it was formed in the image of a goddess, even if at present her identity eludes us. 109 Beck,"Catalogue of Cultic Objects," catalog nos.118 (pp. 108-09), 192-98 (pp.161-68) and discus sion(pp.182-83).</page></plain_text>
