By Stefanos Geroulanos. Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press, 2010. Pp. xvi, 423. ABSTRACT An Atheism that is Not Humanist Emerges in French Thought examines the advent of antihumanism as a cultural figure out of a network of intellectual crises in interwar and postwar France and ties this advent to the more general consequences of secularization in the modern age. Bracketing political judgments, and eschewing dialectical methods, Stefanos Geroulanos shows how the critique of humanism that emerged from disparate quarters of French intellectual life resulted in a series of negative positions that rendered the human void of any conceptual content and thereby unsuitable as a basis for future political action or philosophical investigation. In addition to basing his analysis on two rigorously sketched concepts of his own design, "antifoundational realism" and "negative anthropology," Geroulanos deploys a striking use of conceptual irony to show how the critical efforts of his protagonists often led to theoretical cul-de-sacs and a heightened measure of existential despondency. The treatment of the emergence of antihumanism as a local phenomenon among a segment of French intellectuals nevertheless encounters prob lems when it abandons the terrain of historical argument for an engagement with broader metaphysical concerns. By participating in the discourse of its subjects, An Atheism that is Not Humanist finds its way into cul-de-sacs of its own, in which, for example, the osten sibly political bearing of efforts to transcend mere politics for broader considerations of the "theo-political crisis of modernity" remains unclear. Finally, by accepting the terms of the phenomenological diagnosis of metaphysical crisis in the interwar years, the book compromises certain of its genealogical aspirations, especially with regard to the legacy of Third Republic idealism and the specific qualities of post-phenomenological structuralism. Keywords: atheism, humanism, antihumanism, secularization, phenomenology, existen tialism, structuralism In the second lecture of his 1979 course at the College de France, The Birth of Biopolitics, Michel Foucault elaborates on the nonhistoricist quality of his method in terms of a "strategic" rather than a "dialectical" logic: A logic of strategy does not stress contradictory terms within a homogeneity that prom ises their resolution in a unity. The function of strategic logic is to establish the possible connections between disparate terms which remain disparate. The logic of strategy is the logic of connections between the heterogeneous and not the logic of the homogenization of the contradictory.1 1.

Graham Burchell (New York: Picador, 2008), 42.</page><page sequence="2">258 KNOX PEDEN This methodological statement provides Foucault with his warrant for an analysis of the relation between the "disparate terms" of freedom and law in the emer gence of liberal governmentalities in the twentieth century. But this option for the strategic over the dialectical also serves as a rejection of a Marxist reading of neo liberalism's advent. It is no coincidence, then, that this course is also the forum in which Foucault's patience with both Marxism as a historical paradigm and socialism as a French political platform reaches its nadir. Foucault's relationship with Marxism had been a stormy one from the outset of his career. But perhaps the most that can be confidently said about the ambivalent analysis of liberalism in this course is that it is predicated on a critique of "socialism" and its lack of a coherent notion of government. This link Foucault establishes between an option for strategic genealogy and an aversion to political and historiographical dialectics provides us with a helpful point of entry into Stefanos Geroulanos's challenging account of recent French intellectual history in An Atheism that is Not Humanist Emerges in French Thought. Focusing on a narrow period, roughly 1930 to 1954, and proceeding as an investigation into the emergence of antihumanism as a cultural figure in the overlapping spheres of philosophy, literature, theology, and politics, the book augurs a sea change in our historical approach to French intellectual cur rents. Comparable to Foucault's disdain for politicized histories of liberalism, Geroulanos's frustration with the ubiquitous tendency to investigate recent French thought with an eye toward its ethical or political balance sheet simmers throughout the book. To be sure, Foucault's exasperation was local and specific, conditioned by late-1970s French electoral politics. Geroulanos's is, by contrast, more broadly institutional and perhaps generational. The similarity is striking nonetheless. In both cases, the scholars stake their analyses on the conviction that political lenses have heretofore obscured rather than illuminated the historical object in question, be it "liberalism" or "French antihumanism." The methodological consequences follow, and Geroulanos's terms are ulti mately no less "disparate" than Foucault's. An Atheism that is Not Humanist tells a story in which the negation of God that constitutes modern secularization entails a second negation of Man that is just as unfinished, and what is more, just as impossible to accomplish. In other words, the negation of Man that follows the negation of God is not to be coded as the negation of the negation, promising a dialectical reconciliation in a higher theology (or ontology, or ontotheology). Instead, the peculiar title of Geroulanos's volume promises something closer, in spirit if not the letter, to a grammatical double negative that results more in insoluble paradox than positive sense. Indeed, Geroulanos's titular concepts prior to their negations—theism and humanism—are presented as disparate, as is the manner in which they are negated ("a-" vs. "not"). The book in effect weaves a tapestry out of the strategic relations among these heterogeneous elements in French intellectual life. And yet this tapestry has its points de capitón, as Jacques Lacan would call them. These anchoring points are provided by the two core concepts of Gerou lanos's analysis: antifoundational realism and negative anthropology. If atheism</page><page sequence="3">NEITHER/NOR 259 and antihumanism remain rigorously underdetermined throughout the book,2 these concepts often function as their sharper, more analytically useful surrogates. Both are elaborated at length in the first part of the book, "The 1930s," which makes up two-thirds of the volume. By and large the authors under consideration in the second part, "The Postwar Decade," abandon the subjectivism and narrow scientific concern of antifoundational realism, focusing their energies instead on the consolidation of negative anthropology. As for the contents of these concepts, Geroulanos defines the former as "a kind of philosophical 'realism' that denies man any kind of transcendental separation from the reality he finds himself in, attributes to him a contribution to this reality, and forces him to accept his pow erlessness to radically change—or escape—from it" (51). Negative anthropology, for its part, "attempts a generalized interpretation of man in terms that place unified notions of the human in suspension and deny that it owns or controls his own specificity and particularity" (12). As Geroulanos remarks, the latter is modeled on "negative theology," and provides a cornerstone for his genealogical claim that existentialism and phenomenology laid the ground for structuralism's emphasis on extrinsic determinations of "the human" by first evacuating it of all pre-established content. If these two concepts anchor the book, its weight comes mainly from textual engagements with the leading intellectual lights of the period in question. Many of these readings are exquisite. In the accounts of Maurice Blanchot and Georges Bataille, in particular, Geroulanos maintains the tension of his double negative paradox to a shimmering degree. With Blanchot, we learn that "[i]n being infi nite, negation is a negation of the infinite; in being the successful negation of the divine, it demonstrates its own lack of foundation, its existence as lack of foundation" (256). Resisting the negation of the finite that conceptually inheres in the infinite, the infinite negation that is finitude usurps the latter's power, persisting as endless, groundless denial. Bataille's sovereignty, like Blanchot's freedom, also finds its strength in its perennial failure. In light of man's insuf ficiency, "being reveals itself to him when his attempt to grasp and negate the world in fact shows his imprisonment in it" (192). In other words, the negation that constitutes my evacuated subjectivity persists and succeeds only insofar as it encounters a countervailing negation that prevents it from persisting and suc ceeding completely. 2. The pliability Geroulanos affords "atheism" makes for a stark contrast with Martin Hägglund's recent effort to delineate a conceptually specific "radical atheism" rooted in Derridean deconstruction in his Radical Atheism: Derrida and the Time of Life (Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press, 2008). For Geroulanos, "[a]theism is traditionally identified with secularism and humanism" (4). For Hägglund, "atheism has traditionally limited itself to denying the existence of God and immortality, without questioning the desire for immortality" (Hägglund, Radical Atheism, 1). Where Geroulanos proceeds to historically investigate the vanity of secularism and the vacuity of humanism, Hägglund philosophically investigates the consequences of a concept of desire bound by the constraints of temporal succession or "infinite finitude," to use Hägglund's term of art. Their differing recourses to the "traditional" reflect this difference of method, which also accounts for their divergent conclusions concerning the pathos of finitude. For Hägglund, finitude is not to be misconstrued as entailing metaphysical privation or a pathos of lack. Rather, it is simply an ontological condition that, by ensuring the transience of all things, allows for the possibility of value and care as such. For Geroulanos, by contrast, the pathos attendant to finitude results in an ethico-historical imperative whose main consequence is "the promise of a world without promises" (315).</page><page sequence="4">260 KNOX PEDEN In this instance, we find a use of conceptual irony that is not merely Geroula nos's rhetorical forte; it is his methodological touchstone. And it turns out to be intimately related to an aspect of the volume that we might say, in homage to this kind of irony, is its greatest strength as well as its greatest liability: the recurrent tracking of a movement away from politics toward an ontological discourse that ostensibly transcends and includes the domain of mere politics. Here the rejec tion of dialectical reconciliation in favor of strategic irony, which buttresses both the political disavowal that shapes the work as a whole, as well as its isolated readings, determines the very contours of Geroulanos's historical narrative. For his exploration of a theoretical rejection of politics in various aspects of intellec tual life involves demonstrating the historical existence of an actual rejection of politics on the part of his protagonists. This demonstration constitutes one of the book's greatest achievements. And yet, elevating this rejection to something like world-historical (or at least France-historical) status requires the rejection in turn of various currents of French intellectual and cultural life that did not participate in this rejection of politics, but rather rejected this rejection. The point is not to fault Geroulanos for not covering certain thinkers and currents; he successfully delim its and justifies his field of inquiry. Rather, it is to highlight the implications of historically privileging a discourse that allows "philosophers to speak of their age politically without really involving themselves in contemporary movements" (99). Before turning to these implications and the specifically historical claims of his account, it is worth tracking further the myriad uses of conceptual irony that inform Geroulanos's strongest arguments. Striking among these is the role accorded to antifoundational realism, a mode of thought for which "the comple mentarity of quantum physics and phenomenology ... form[ed] the ground" and which in turn "provided a foundation" for many of the motifs of existentialism to come (59, 97). In the 1930s, philosophers of science were moved to reconsider the foundations of modern science by developments in quantum physics. The new epistemologies promulgated by these thinkers dovetailed with the more general ized critique of neo-Kantian epistemology that resulted from the impact of Hus serlian and Heideggerian phenomenology in France. For example, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle clearly was a stimulant to Alexandre Kojéve's thought. And yet, the most vital component of that thought was its appropriation of a Heideg gerian notion of "ontological dualism" that was opposed to the "substantialist dualisms" of the rationalist tradition (69, 74). Geroulanos persuasively shows how Kojéve coded Heisenberg's observing in terms of Heidegger's Dasein and the former's observed in terms of the latter's Vorhandensein. The being of the "being-there" (Dasein; étre-lá for Kojéve) is of a different quality from the being of the "being-given" (Vorhandensein; étre-donné for Kojéve). The two stand in a permanent relation, forever conditioning each other, never being reconciled into each other. To be a "realist" in this scenario is to recognize at once the absence of common ground for the two modes of being and their fraught coexistence in a common frame. Kojéve's unorthodox appropriation of Heidegger's concepts, crucial to the emergence of antifoundational realism, finds a correlate in the instrumental role played by Henri Corbin's notorious translation of Dasein as réalité humain in</page><page sequence="5">NEITHER/NOR 261 the advent of negative anthropology. Rather than hold Corbin's choice liable for an anthropological misreading of Heidegger in the first wave of his reception, Geroulanos discovers in it one of the major steps in the evacuation of said réalité of any grounded, certifiable content. The irony is stark. "Réalité humaine" is not evidence of a French proclivity for humanism that it would fall on Heidegger to correct in his "Letter on 'Humanism'." Instead, it is evidence of a nascent antihumanism, given that réalité humaine clearly plays the role of an existential placeholder completely at odds with the Man of the humanist tradition. Similarly, Kojéve's course on Hegel delineates a negative anthropology in which the figure of Man that results bears nothing within it that is identifiably human. Instead, Man becomes identified with Time itself (164), which is to say with negation, a ruptural force forestalling the homogeneity of death (personal, world-historical, or indeed cosmic). Throughout his myriad intellectual engagements, the chief target of Kojéve's ire turns out to be any conception of Man as separated from a God or eternal presence that would stand apart from him in a relation of transcen dence; hence, Kojéve's preference for Jesus over Paul. With Jesus, God and Man were one and the same; what is more, Jesus's death was God's death. In his birth and death, Jesus is exemplary of the collapse of transcendence. But this moment of pure immanence has been obscured. "Kojéve presents the world after the Cross as a world filled with illusion—the illusion of a transcendent God—and bereft of the fundamental promise of Christianity, that is, Man's rise to self-consciousness, to an assumption of the status of absolute yet nontranscendent, limited negator as heralded by Jesus" (159). To consolidate the point concerning the fate of immanence, we learn that Kojéve secularizes Christianity by returning to Jesus. There is a parallel here with Corbin's providing the lineaments of antihumanism by repeatedly exposing us to réalité humain. In both instances, the affirmation of the concept is predicated upon evacuating it of content so as to render its inherited meaning void. Likewise, Sartre's existentialism is a humanism only insofar as it negates all antecedent conceptions of the human and is thereby "antihumanist." The tenets of "Existen tialism is a Humanism" were presaged, however, in 1937's "The Transcendence of the Ego." In the chapter devoted to this work, alongside Bataille's The Blue of Noon and Emmanuel Levinas's On Escape, Geroulanos establishes the tension that unifies all three efforts: the desire for a "world beyond transcendence" (174; italics added). For Sartre, this takes the form of a plunge into the determinations of social and political being. For Bataille, as noted, it involves a deliberate keno sis or "emptying out" of the "I" of subjectivity that affirms one's insufficiency to, and imprisonment in, a world one cannot fully negate. For Le vinas, it involves a conceptualization of "excendence," which Geroulanos describes as "at once a movement beyond being and a consequence inherent in the basic structure of Being itself, a revolt against Being necessitated by the very imposition of Being" (198). In all instances, necessity is conjoined with impossibility; "success" amounts to failure. In the embrace of this failure, transcendence—not simply as God, or I, but as philosophical paradigm—is "transcended." Here the scare quotes are ours, but Geroulanos has recourse to them as well in his recognition that with Heidegger, ultimately, "Man is 'founded' on Dasein" (242).</page><page sequence="6">262 KNOX PEDEN Antifoundationalism founds; transcendence is transcended; and Jesus secular izes Christianity. Time and again, An Atheist that is Not Humanist elucidates, with an exceptional rigor, a discourse in which what is ontologically denied is methodologically deployed in the discourse itself. This deployment encounters a limit, however, in the case of politics and the recurrent effort to have the ontologi cal denigration of politics retain a political quality, however inchoate or diapha nous, at the level of method. Geroulanos's principled aversion to political judgment often manifests itself as a greater patience for those whose writings and legacies are ultimately more given to ambiguity than conviction. For example, each of the book's two main parts opens with a discussion of Andre Malraux, the anticolonialist firebrand who became De Gaulle's Minister of Culture. In a speech for UNESCO in 1946, Mal raux placed the question of the death of man at the center of the postwar agenda of cultural politics. Geroulanos's rationale for beginning the section on the 1930s with Malraux is no less straightforward. The themes of his 1926 epistolary novel, La tentation de I'Occident, augmented in his Goncourt-winning La condition humaine, were the first instance in which antihumanism was coded as a left-wing rather than a right-wing position, as it had been at least since Joseph de Maistre. The strength of this left-wing association becomes increasingly tenuous, how ever, not simply because of the details of Malraux's biography, but because of Geroulanos's own agenda. For among the various items transcended in An Athe ism that is Not Humanist, one recurs with stark regularity: the left-right binary of post-1789 European politics. Indeed, crucial to Geroulanos's historical frame is the political disaffection that shook a generation of intellectuals in the wake of the First World War and the terminus of the long nineteenth century. As a result, a significant part of his story addresses the disintegration of a coherent, much less viable, politics in the interwar years, and the repetition of this failure in the wake of the Second World War. One of the most striking aspects of Geroulanos's historical narrative is that the difference between the despondency of the post-World War II moment and that of the interwar years is treated as one of degree rather than kind. In a ges ture of revisionism as bold as it is subtle, Geroulanos identifies the Resistance, rather than the Holocaust, as the ideal prism through which to understand the figures of destitution manifest in postwar French intellectual life. Consequently, questions of the ex-Résistant reception of Heidegger's "Letter on 'Humanism'" greatly supervene on its ex-Nazi intention. The unique appeal of this document is explained as follows: Heidegger suggests the present to be a time for reflection, rather than for engagement, a unique moment in which to escape the entirety of European metaphysics. In doing so, he quietly identifies himself with a wing of the intellectual left that, aware of the impossibility of extending the resistance's 'struggle against inhumanity,' seeks to reinterpret the present moment in terms of the collapse of Europe and the coming of a Hegelian end of history, an end from which it is necessary and nearly impossible to escape. (238-239) The antidote to political travesty is thus primarily philosophical. But again, the political travesty of the postwar moment is simply the intensification of a travesty</page><page sequence="7">NEITHER/NOR 263 that was already underway in the 1930s, and whose medicine was already clear to the most enlightened observers. Geroulanos concludes his earlier discussion of this period with an emphatic claim: By failing to properly understand the limitations and illusions imposed by its interaction with reality, modern humanism has led to Nazism. The corollary of such a claim is that only phenomenology, buttressed and contextualized by a philosophical understanding of the rise of modernity, can reopen the question of man in such a way as to allow both his fall from his delusional idealist pinnacle, and a solid philosophical reinterpretation of his theo-political situation in modernity. (203; italics in original) "Only phenomenology" can provide escape from the political destitution of the age, a destitution conditioned at once by the "delusional" idealism of academic philosophy and the world-historical, and well-nigh metaphysical, situation that is modernity itself. Geroulanos presents this conclusion as resulting, in part, from the collapse of a coherent concept of humanism as Communists, Catholics, and "nonconformists" all jockeyed to justify their political agenda in humanist terms, a scramble surveyed in a chapter titled "No Humanism Except Mine!" In effect, this chapter provides the strategic complement to the philosophical developments enumerated throughout the rest of the book. Especially revealing in this regard is the discussion of Paul Nizan, the "fanatic" Communist perhaps most famous for his evisceration of Third Republic idealism in The Watchdogs. In contrast to those writers who were able to bear and intellectually work through the despondency of the age, Geroulanos suggests that "Nizan's suicide is perhaps exemplary as a moment of a complete disillusionment with the possibil ity of making politics meaningful in an intellectual culture torn by division and war" (127-128). In twice referencing Nizan's "suicide," and moreover suggest ing it as "perhaps exemplary" of a crisis of meaning, Geroulanos converts what would otherwise be a minor factual error into a symptom of the liabilities of his approach. Nizan did not commit suicide in his despondency over the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact. Instead, appalled by the French Communist Party's endorse ment of this sordid affair, he committed the political act of leaving the party altogether. His untimely death came from a stray bullet at the Battle of Dunkirk, where he was serving as an interpreter for the British.3 What makes this error revealing is the extent to which Nizan's political act had virtually no connection with, nor is it particularly illuminated by recourse to, a theological-political crisis of meaning, just as, for many, the Resistance was not the cipher of metaphysical ambiguity it would come to be for Blanchot and others, but a matter of stark political clarity.4 That an intellectual-historical methodology would don the terms of its objects in a mode of immanent critique is not necessarily problematic. What is troubling, rather, is that an evaluation of all historical activity in the rarefied terms of a theological-political crisis of meaning 3. W. D. Redfern, Paul Nizan: Committed Literature in a Conspiratorial World (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1972), 197-198. 4. Cf. Sartre's remark in his preface to Nizan's Aden, Arable, transí. Joan Pinkham (New York: Columbia University Press, 1986), 12: "We thought that if Nizan had lived he would have shared our new subtlety—that is, our compromises. What had preserved his violent purity? A stray bullet, that's all, nothing to brag about."</page><page sequence="8">264 KNOX PEDEN deprives itself of the capacity to articulate what precisely constitutes the political quality of a particular historical act. In other words, if ontology is the discursive level that counts, then politics loses any specificity within that discourse. Bataille may adopt an existential position that is neither fascist nor anti-fascist. But as political positions, fascism and antifascism are mutually exclusive terms in a collectively exhaustive set. One can be indifferent to fascism; one cannot be politically indifferent to fascism. To be sure, the scenario in which Bataille assumes the excluded middle of neither fascism nor antifascism is a literary work: The Blue of Noon. It is also true that, in Geroulanos's discussion of this work, antifascism effectively shades into communism, and communism and fascism are obviously not collectively exhaustive positions. But the contradiction in terms that results from the attempt to be politically indifferent to politics (as opposed to being simply indifferent to politics) emerges in starkest relief in Geroulanos's discussion of Maurice Merleau-Ponty's controversial Humanism and Terror. Geroulanos has laudably made clear the futility of trying to shield Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological writings from his political (mis)adventures by showing the intimate link between his arguments in both domains. Just as the Phenomenology of Perception pro vides us with a historical ontology of subjective indeterminacy resulting from the infinite array of embodied perspectives subsumed under the ostensible binary of flesh and world, it turns out that the lesson of Merleau-Ponty's Humanism and Terror is a historical ontology of subjective indeterminacy resulting from the infinite array of political perspectives subsumed under the ostensible binary of anticommunism and communism. Geroulanos redeems Humanism and Terror insofar as he shows it to be irreducible to a vulgar defense of the show trials. But the victory is arguably pyrrhic insofar as the book is shown instead to advocate "the need for engagement as a consequence of contingency and of the inability to predict the future—in other words, the ethical command to engage with others in a way that would facilitate a genuine improvement of human relations" (285). In a stroke, politics is collapsed back into ethics, with the dubious consequence that Merleau-Ponty invites us to act without principle and without foresight, but to act all the same. The alibi of acting "in a way that would facilitate a genuine improvement of human relations" is not only cold comfort; it is also disingenuous insofar as virtually every one of its terms is undermined by the preceding direc tive to conceive of "the need for engagement as a consequence of contingency and the inability to predict the future." The critique here is of Merleau-Ponty, not Geroulanos, who performs the admirable task of loosening the knots of such contorted intellectual efforts. More over, it is to be recognized that Geroulanos in no way endorses Merleau-Ponty's politics. His analysis takes the terms of his subjects seriously and sheds much needed light on their aims and investments. Two problems nonetheless persist. First, Geroulanos's judicious refusal of endorsement is matched, in most cases, by his impatience with condemnation. This balanced perspective is not extended, however, to those unrepentant ones who clung to their investments, be they Com munist or Catholic. The error of those in this latter camp is not that they were politically misguided, but that they were intellectually misguided simply by being</page><page sequence="9">NEITHER/NOR 265 political. Here the vortex occasioned by an apolitical stance that seeks a political bearing shifts from the objects of Geroulanos's analysis to the analysis itself. The second problem is not unrelated and concerns how the fidelity to the discourse of his subjects overdetermines Geroulanos's historical frame, blurring the distinc tion between an analysis of a group of intellectuals who believed themselves to have successfully rejected the "idealism" of their forbearers and an analysis of a group of intellectuals who actually succeeded in rejecting the "idealism" of their forbearers. Indeed, a common thread ties these problems together. The abandonment of politics for any number of surrogates—ethics, anthropology, "theanthropy," lit erature—is a recurrent theme of the book, but ultimately they all fall within the orbit of the singular force of ontology, or, risking pleonasm for greater specific ity, Heideggerian ontology. For all its innovation, An Atheism that is Not Human ist cultivates a familiar position: that the arrival of German phenomenology in the interwar years is signally responsible for the innovations in French thought from existentialism to poststructuralism. To be sure, Geroulanos shows the selective appropriation of this foreign tradition, and is never so crass as to assume a pure Heideggerianism against which to judge its French deviations. Nevertheless, the language of ontology is so integral to the volume that Geroulanos cannot avoid reduplicating, at an analytic level, the falling scales that his subjects claimed to have experienced in their own rejection of Third Republic idealism. One conse quence of this is that Léon Brunschvicg, the top dog of Nizan's maligned chiens de garde, and a key subject of discussion in the book's first part, maintains his colors as another specimen from the bestiary: the originary scapegoat of twenti eth-century French thought. Chief among Brunschvicg's demerits was his faith in progress, his conviction that the history of philosophy and scientific thought manifested a species-wide improvement that was as moral as it was rational. In this regard, he plays the Pangloss to the Candides of An Atheism that is Not Humanist. Like Dürkheim and other Third Republic luminaries, Brunschvicg valorized the abstractions of universalism in a social as well as a scientific sense. The interwar years move ment "toward the concrete" was a rejection of this abstraction, its philosophical futility as well as its moral vanity. But what of the content of Brunschvicg's philosophical ideas? As Geroulanos illuminates it, Brunschvicg held to a ratio nalist idealism because it was the only philosophy capable of overcoming "both the 'failure of realism' and the 'anthropomorphic excesses of naturalism'" (44). In other words, Brunschvicg rejected the naive realism of an unmediated access to empirical phenomena and at the same time rejected any position that would ascribe some kind of mystical subjectivity to nature itself. As for Brunschvicg's humanism, we learn that it amounts to a vision of reason as historically cumula tive, decoupled from theological or metaphysical speculation, and immanent to the relation between consciousness and world. Lest this appear as a Gallic Hege lianism, it should be noted that Brunschvicg's hostility to Hegel was legendary.5 5. Cf. Louis Althusser's remark that Brunschvicg thought Hegel had "the mental age of a twelve year-old" in Louis Althusser, Philosophy and the Spontaneous Philosophy of the Scientists and Other Essays, ed. Gregory Elliott, transí. Warren Montag (London: Verso, 1990), 124.</page><page sequence="10">266 KNOX PEDEN He recoiled from the Hegelian notion that absolute knowledge would reach some kind of goal, thereby putting an end to scientific progress. The impossibility of this end, the permanence of an ultimately irreconcilable but co-implicative rela tion between thought and world, is clear from a passage of Brunschvicg's that Geroulanos cites in a footnote: Reflection on the evolution of science thereby leads to a perpetual rectification of the historical perspective of humanity, just as science itself, through approximation upon approximation, forever renders the structure of the universe more coherent and more true. The progress of the human perspective and of the cosmic structure are, at root, one and the same progress: the progress of this intellectual consciousness, some of whose fundamen tal traits Kant no doubt neglected, but to which he still managed to tie the fate of critical idealism. (328-329) The key words of this passage are "perpetual" and "forever," terms that suggest a notion of science as an always incomplete process. Brunschvicg's commit ment to immanence is no less emphatic, given that neither consciousness nor the structure of the cosmos is deemed transcendent to the other. In this respect, Brunschvicg's position comes to look a lot like Kojéve's, not to mention Gaston Bachelard's and the other purveyors of antifoundational realism.6 The continuity becomes stronger when we consider that all of the humanisms that putatively reject Brunschvicg's example are coded as antihumanisms insofar as they deny certifiable content to the "human." For Kojéve again, the human is the vector of Time qua negation in the world. But what is the human for Brunschvicg, if not the vector of Reason qua critique and "perpetual rectification" in a world to which it is irreducible? Making the vector more capacious or ontologically basic doesn't change its quality as a vector. The human is not essentially human in either case, but essentially something else. What this means is that Geroulanos could deploy the same ingenuity he uses to show how Kojéve's anthropology is anti-anthropocentric to show that Brunsch vicg's humanism, like Sartre's, is actually an antihumanism as well. In a different register, we can note that the paradoxes of freedom so clearly drawn from the writings of Blanchot and Bataille were by and large prefigured in André Gide's L'Immoraliste, published in 1902. The existence of precursors does not disqualify the readings that Geroulanos does offer, but it does attenuate the persuasiveness of his historical claim about the interwar years as a privileged moment, all of which raises the question: why is this moment privileged? An Atheism that is Not Humanist begins in the interwar years because it adheres to the Husserlian and Heideggerian diagnosis of this crisis as, above all, a crisis of metaphysics. In accepting this point of departure, the endgame of Geroulanos's analysis is all but scripted in advance; idealism is rejected as the pinnacle of philosophical hubris, and "only phenomenology" provides a philosophical reprieve. The first wave of this reprieve takes the form of negative anthropology. Structuralism is then coded 6. For an effort to track the persistence of Brunschvicgian idealism via Bachelard into the structuralist era, chiefly with reference to Althusser, Bourdieu. and Foucault, see Joel Revill, "Taking France to the School of the Sciences: Léon Brunschvicg, Gaston Bachelard, and the French Epistemological Tradition," PhD dissertation, Duke University (2006).</page><page sequence="11">NEITHER/NOR 267 as a "radicalization" of this moment, seeking "to effect the proper anthropology" in the wake of the preceding labor of the negative (309). But if the case of Brunschvicg complicates Geroulanos's genealogy on the front end, the back end is rendered no less problematic as a result. Despite expec tations, and despite Geroulanos's cautious remarks concerning structuralism's "radicalization" of antihumanism, the specter of the negation of the negation returns in the book's conclusion. Phenomenological existentialism "negates" humanism via negative anthropology, which is negated in turn by structuralism "to effect the proper anthropology" at a higher order. As hermeneutic clichés go, however, there is another that is perhaps more fitting: the return of the repressed. For with structuralism we witness the resurgence of the idealism disavowed by the generation under review in An Atheism that is Not Humanist. Althusserian Marxism is a case in point. The radicalism of Louis Althusser and his students' break with Marxist tradition lay in its turn from the eleventh thesis on Feuerbach to the first, which affirmed that idealism had historically harbored the active side of philosophy and was thus of greater critical use than the various passive "mate rialisms" of Marx's own day. What was perspicuous about Althusser's effort was its cognizance of a similar mode of passivity emergent in the various "atheisms" elaborated in Geroulanos's account. This tendency toward passivity reaches its pinnacle in the book's last substantive chapter. Geroulanos's brilliant reading of Jean Hyppolite ends with a breath of indifference; with man in suspension, he becomes a vessel adrift on the currents of ontology. Althusser's obsession with the "epistemological break" called upon precisely the most idealist elements of French philosophy of science in its effort to restore an active role to reason as a "theoretical practice" that would re-hoist the sails. To be sure, Althusser is but one example, although his is certainly germane to the question of antihumanism. The case of Jacques Lacan is perhaps even more instructive, especially when we consider the legacy of Alexandre Koyré, a key figure in An Atheism that is Not Humanist. In his discussion of antifoundational realism, Geroulanos provides a powerful interpretation of Koyré's "Galilean studies" that emphasizes the ambiguity at their core. On the one hand, Koyré historically affirms the metaphysical caesura that resulted from Galileo's math ematization of the universe. On the other, he recognizes its arbitrary quality; the infinite universe of the modern age is more a result of a shift of worldview than of scientific experimentation. Koyré thus gets to have it both ways. Insofar as it renders the closed world of the medieval era obsolete, modern science obtains as a discourse. And yet, given that its basis is ultimately metaphysical and lacking in empirical certitude, a certain theological pathos of lack and destitution persists as well. In effect, we see the twin elements of Koyré's intellectual formation synthe sized in this position: the impact of Brunschvicg's critical idealism on his views of scientific discourse and its progress, alongside the nascent sense of metaphysi cal crisis that Koyré imbibed from Heidegger's and Husserl's teachings. What does this have to do with Lacan? Though Geroulanos demonstrates the ambiguity at the core of Koyré's thought, he ultimately accentuates the Heideg gerian element, the sense of loss and disarray in the wake of Galileo. But with Lacan's recourse to Koyré in the 1960s, the weight shifts back to the critical</page><page sequence="12">268 KNOX PEDEN idealist elements of the latter's arguments.7 To be sure, a cornerstone of Lacan's teaching is that subjectivity is predicated on lack. But the cognition of the truth of this lack has as its historical condition, precisely, the discursive advances of mod ern physics and mathematics. In other words, the active role of rational articula tion—in Galileo, in Koyré, in psychoanalysis —is affirmed over the pathos and passivity that such an overweening rationalism ostensibly brokers. And then there is Foucault, whose various archaeological extractions become virtually indistinguishable from critical idealism's conceptual abstractions when they are considered at the level of method. Indeed, despite certain shifts through out his career, Foucault's fundamental gesture remains the same: isolating certain practices, discursive or otherwise, and providing them their historical concept. Notwithstanding the intellectual chasms that separate them, what Althusser, Lacan, and Foucault share is a rejection of the notion of a modern "crisis of meaning" that one would have to intellectually engage qua crisis. They also share a certain measure of intellectual candor with regard to the relationship between their theoretical efforts and politics. For Althusser, all philosophical practice is political; for Lacan, psychoanalysis is indifferent to politics; for Foucault, genea logical recovery provides ethical models at best, and politics is limited to discrete, site-specific engagements decoupled from general crises of historical "meaning." In no instance, however, is the move toward the apolitical deemed to be political. In this regard, the structuralist moment is not so much a radicalization of the brand of antihumanism under review in An Atheism that is Not Humanist as a rejection of it, and here Geroulanos is on the mark when he describes existential ism and structuralism as divergent results of a more general critique of human ism (307) and suggests as well that "[tj he stakes of structuralism were closely intertwined with a rejection of the limitations of the generation of antihumanists discussed [in his book]" (308-309). In this and other respects, Geroulanos has irrevocably upended the conventional genealogy of the field. For example, with the concern for absolute immanence placed at the center of Kojéve's project, the Russian émigré is no longer simply the inspiration for a generation of Hegelian Marxists, but the source of a problematic that would exercise a generation of later philosophers from Michel Henry to Gilles Deleuze. Regarding French Marxism, it is clear that the question of antihumanism is no longer a useful way to con sider the differences between Sartre and Althusser. And indeed, antihumanism is clearly no longer the best rubric for understanding the distinction between phe nomenology and structuralism, given that both currents participate in this more general cultural phenomenon. In terms of historical argument, the signal virtue of Geroulanos's volume is its tracking of the very process articulated in its title, the emergence of an atheism that is not humanist in French thought. Its signal vice, however, is its treatment of a specific variant of this emergence as not simply historically significant, but metaphysically meaningful and hence inescapable, the impossibility of escape being a predominant theme of the book. This treatment runs contrary to the stra 7. See, in particular, "Science and Truth," in Jacques Lacan, Ecrits, transí. Bruce Fink (New York: W. W. Norton, 2006), 726-745.

For Geroulanos has shown how disparate the various elements of this emergence in fact were, and yet it is as if they some how still manage to coalesce in a wholesale eclipse of idealism and the articula tion of a new, more or less unified vocation of thought grounded in destitution. In this respect, one of the most revealing anecdotes in Geroulanos's volume comes from the same thinker who provides the book's title, Emmanuel Levinas: I remember the 1937 Descartes Congress. New philosophical tendencies were already being affirmed; existentialist thought, Catholic thought, Marxist thought. Anguish, death, care, were increasingly popular topics. In the course of one session, Gabriel Marcel launched a fiery attack on those thinkers "deprived of any gift of inner life," blind to God, blind to death. At which point Brunschvicg,... with that air of having no air, said: "I think that the death of Léon Brunschvicg preoccupies Léon Brunschvicg less than the death of Gabriel Marcel preoccupies Gabriel Marcel." (181-182). Like many others, in his own day and later, Brunschvicg viewed these new philo sophical tendencies with a skepticism grounded in rationalism, and he refused to be cowed by the charge that he lacked inner life, not by protesting otherwise but by rejecting the charge's premises. The final irony of An Atheism that is Not Humanist is that its figures of antihumanism are even more disparate and hetero geneous than it ostensibly intends. What is more, the impossibility of historically reconciling this heterogeneity was already recognized in 1918 by Max Weber, Brunschvicg's neo-Kantian counterpart across the Rhine, in his own ruminations on the vocation of thought: "I do not know how one might wish to decide 'sci entifically' the value of French and German culture; for here, too, different gods struggle with one another, now and for all times to come."8 Knox Peden University of Queensland 8.
