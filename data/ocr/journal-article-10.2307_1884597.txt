<plain_text><page sequence="1">WOLFE'S CONSERVATISM, RADICALISM, AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD' WHY are some people conservative, others radical? Can the bitterness between right and left wings be softened, be.- fore their conflicts destroy civilization? To these large prob- lems Professor Wolfe addresses himself; and, as one might infer from his own title no less than from the caption of his book, he thinks that social-psychological science supplies keys to both puzzles. The essay was provoked largely by three groups of stimuli: the smug prejudices of the average Ameri- can undergraduate, the white and red terrors in all countries since 1914, and, not least, the glowing promises of the psy- chologies. 1. Conservatism, Radicalism, and Scientific Method. By A. B. Wolfe. New York: The Macmillan Company. 1923. Pp. 354. $3.50.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 683 In attempting to account for radical and conservative atti- tudes, the author naturally makes many concessions to the Marxian doctrine: people whose material comfort, relative to the rest of the population, is favored by the existing social system, are not good "prospects" for radicalism. And na- turally the numerous exceptions to this simple scheme are immediately noticed. The author accordingly attempts to refine these crude gen- eralizations by the application of several psychological prin- ciples. His approach is reminiscent of that of Carlton Parker (tho he is much better versed in details than was Parker). He emphasizes the determinist point of view, in opposition to personal-praise-and-blame reactions; and he stresses emo- tional factors according to the psychoanalytic, or Freudian, concepts. Thus, he considers that radicalism usually springs from obstructed desires, and states that similar revolts are often suppressed or sublimated, so that the individual is able to preserve an appearance of conservative respectability. The psychiatric doctrine of " rationalization" appears frequently. Yet alongside these psychoanalytic rubrics the author eclec- tically introduces materials from most of the other sects which call themselves psychological: behaviorism, endocrine glands, Giddings's mental types, and the popular instincts. Instinc- tive fear of change, for example, is held to be a mainspring of conservatism; and again, in connection with radicalism, we read: "That there are positive instinctive tendencies which give rise to desire for innovation cannot well be questioned. These include curiosity (the tap-root of all science), workman- ship and contrivance (the root of the practical arts), and esthetic self-expression (the root of the fine arts)." When the author has done with the motivation and char- acteristics (including modes of behavior, or "methods") of conservatism and radicalism, he comes to scientific attitude and method - and, curiously, he does not inquire partic- ularly into the " motivation " of this third attitude. He contrasts at length the scientific temper with " popular- mindedness," and he sketches the development of scientific method - all with special reference to the difficulties of pre-</page><page sequence="3">684 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS serving one's balance while dealing with social issues. The characteristic statement comes out: "No one who does not become a thoro-going determinist can ever completely acquire the scientific attitude." That this is putting it a little too strongly is believed by many of us who agree that the mechan- istic hypothesis is more probable and more productive of new knowledge than the anthropomorphism which appeals so strongly to scientists as well as to other sorts of people. A few observations must be selected, with reference to the adequacy of this analysis. First, the earmarks of conserva- tism and radicalism are not as sharply drawn as one might expect. Is the difference well stated as attitude toward change - the radical urging, the conservative opposing? In Russia, and even in "progressive" countries, one supposes that there are numerous conservatives who are profoundly dissatisfied with the status quo. The conservative proponents of the Mellon plan of tax revision were demanding change. It seems possible, too, that we are often conservative on some matters and radical on others - politics and divorce, for ex- ample; but this question of correlations is not raised. The lesser biases of scientists, again, are not very closely noticed; it does not seem to occur to the author that many of his breth- ren will regard his selection and interpretation of materials as somewhat partisan rather than scientific. All these weak- nesses are referable to his failure to apply statistical concepts to his problem. My second critical observation is that the psychological analysis is naturally exposed to whatever weaknesses may develop within its various foundations. The gaps are wide between normal human mass-behavior, which the sociologist is probing, and the nervous physiology, the animal instincts, and the mental-disease phenomena from which he draws his explanatory principles. Several psychologists, therefore, are questioning seriously whether McDougall's instincts and the Freudian schemata are not as far from fundamental elements as the ad hoc "instincts" (such as religious) which McDou- gall rejected. Consequently, while the doctrines offered here, and the "illustrative" matter with which they are applied,</page><page sequence="4">REVIEW17S 685 supply numerous interesting hypotheses, I think the author would have been on solider ground if he had given more atten- tion to the question of objective and statistical methods for testing such deductions. After his investigation into the natural history of conserva- tive, radical, and scientific attitudes, Professor Wolfe con- siders the ethical aspects of these conflicts. Along what lines, if any, he inquires, can the conservative-radical struggles be ameliorated or adjudicated? He preaches the utilitarian gos- pel, and rejects metaphysical absolutes of all sorts, whether religious or sociological. Behavior is to be judged morally by its effects on the happiness of the greatest number. This in- dividualism as to the ends which are called finally good, how- ever, is distinguished sharply from laissez-faire individualism as to the social means for promoting the general welfare; the latter, of course, our author rejects. He asserts, moreover, that his ethical democracy does not imply uniform treatment of all persons; it does imply the giving of opportunities in accord with scientifically demonstrated capacities to use such opportunities. This discussion seems mainly sound and searching, if not very compact; but at least two of the principal contentions are not demonstrated. One is that this ethics is supplied with a scientific basis by the new objective psychology. I doubt if much has been added, in essentials, to Bentham's or Mill's statement of the case. The other proposition which is not convincing is that popularization of the scientific attitude will greatly diminish the conservative-radical warfare. The au- thor does, indeed, adumbrate, at numerous points, a quali- fication: "The world needs to be converted to Christianity almost as much as it does to science." He asserts that pug- nacity and acquisitiveness must be more largely replaced by sympathy and toleration. He would doubtless go far toward agreeing with Bertrand Russell's recent gloomy pronounce- ment, that "science has not given men more self-control, more kindliness, or more power of discounting their passions." (Icarus.) But he does not set forth clearly enough, I think, the difference between an objective, scientific attitude in dis-</page><page sequence="5">686 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS covering matters of fact (including other people's desires) and objectivity or impartiality in loving one's neighbors well enough to be a good citizen. The foregoing criticisms have been directed at the book in its character as a piece of scientific pioneering in a vital and baffling subject. They are of less consequence when one con- siders it as a textbook, as an introduction to the study of social problems - altho here I must add that the exposition leaves a little to be desired in the way of lucidity and economy of words. A good many teachers, nevertheless, are likely to adjudge the essay a valuable instrument for correcting con- servative or radical astigmatisms of undergraduates, or other sophomores. Z.
