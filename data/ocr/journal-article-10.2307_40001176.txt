<plain_text><page sequence="1">Laurence Perrine 127 For generations of readers Tennyson s * Crossing the Bar has been the definitive expression of a confident faith in immortality. It has been read at innumerable funeral services by clergy intent on giving comfort to the bereaved. By thousands of readers- bereaved or other- wise-it has been valued for its beauty and its assured religious faith. But now James R. Kincaid tells us that these readers have all been wrong- that the last two lines offer only a "strained and pathetic surface affirmation" in which the poet's previous stoic firmness "has melted to a plaintive hope to see his Pilot"- and that the "over- whelming impression given by the poem is one of depression and gloom."1 Can these thousands of earlier readers have all been so mistaken? Can they have misread the poem as a quiet assertion of faith not only without being overwhelmed but without even being made momen- tarily uneasy by the "dark current of frustration" that Mr. Kincaid feels beneath its "placid surface"? It is possible. The great mass of the public are not skilled poetry readers, and no doubt the majority of readers who have liked this poem have been attracted to it for reasons other than sheer love of poetry. They have been attracted, indeed, by that very quality of assured faith, beautifully expressed, which Mr. Kincaid tells us is missing from the poem. They lacked the reading skills, no doubt, to sound out the poem's deeper currents, and so accepted it without feeling even a vague unease. Nevertheless, I believe that they are right and that Mr. Kincaid is wrong. But let us be clear what we are quarreling about. We are not quarreling about Tennyson's conscious intention in the poem. Mr. Kincaid would agree, I am sure, that Tennyson intended the poem to be taken as his readers have taken it. All his life Tennyson felt a need to believe in immortality, and for most of his life he believed that he did believe in it. His request that "Crossing the Bar" be placed last in all volumes of his poetry is a clear indication of the significance he gave to the poem. What Mr. Kincaid suggests is that the poem does not realize Tennyson's intention- that unconsciously it betrays a dark doubt, a fright, and a frustration, which the poet consciously rejected and denied. On this ground I differ with him. 1 "Tennyson's 'Crossing the Bar': A Poem of Frustration," VF, III (Winter, 1965), 57-61.</page><page sequence="2">128 Victorian Poetry If we turn to Tennyson's other poems and to his recorded utter- ances, the evidence certainly favors Mr. Kincaid. Tennyson is reported once to have said, "111 shake my fist in God Almighty's face and say it isn't fair, if I find there is no immortality."2 On another occasion, pacing the cliffs of Dover, Tennyson shouted, "If there is no im- mortality, I shall hurl myself into the sea."3 The vehemence of these remarks clearly betrays Tennyson's desperation and underlying lack of confidence. At the end of In Memoriam Tennyson felt that he had reached an assured belief and speaks of "the truths that never can be proved" which he has accepted, either out of a "faith that comes of self-control" (CXXXI) or because, "like a man in wrath," his heart cried out "I have felt" (CXXIV).4 But modern readers do not find in In Memoriam the "firmer mind" which Tennyson himself felt he had achieved. Rather, they find In Memoriam more notable for "the quality of its doubt" than for "the quality of its faith." "Its faith is a poor thing," writes T. S. Eliot, "but its doubt is a very intense experience."5 Thus In Memoriam furnishes a paradigm of what Mr. Kincaid finds in "Crossing the Bar." Every poem, nevertheless, is its own world, and must be interpreted so. The Tennyson who wrote "Crossing the Bar" was not the same Tennyson who wrote In Memoriam. Men vary from minute to minute. Our moods change; our confidence in ourselves or in God surges and recedes; we are whole men one minute and divided men the next. "Crossing the Bar" must be interpreted in the light of its own internal evidence. To be fair to Mr. Kincaid, he attempts such an interpretation. I cannot but feel, nevertheless, that he is deceiving himself and is unconsciously extrapolating from his reading of Tenny- son's other poetry- and indeed of recent Tennyson criticism. Had Tennyson written nothing but "Crossing the Bar," would Mr. Kincaid have been overwhelmed by its impression of "depression and gloom'? I cannot believe so. The tone of "Crossing the Bar" is not one of 2 Cited by Paull F. Baum, in Tennyson Sixty Years After (Chapel Hill, 1948), p. 122, who credits it to D. A.

Similar judgments have been expressed by other critics; for example, Elsie Elizabeth Phare, in The Poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins (Cambridge, 1933), p. 99, who refers to "Tennyson's creed, in which honest doubt fought with a perhaps dishonest optimism"; and ^Harold Nicolson, in Tennyson ( Boston and New York, 1925), p. 263, who says "at the end he erects a very convincing structure on the side of doubt and a very flimsy structure on the side of faith."</page><page sequence="3">Laurence Perrine 129 "frustration-doubt," but of calm, untroubled faith. The crucial issue concerns the exact weight of the word hope in the second last line. Hope is ordinarily defined in terms of desire accompanied by expectation. But the intensity of expectation varies with each use of the word. The meaning may fall anywhere on a scale that runs from assured expectation to almost complete lack of it. The position we assign on this scale to the word as it occurs in Tennyson's poem will of course determine how we read the poem aloud. If we place it toward the lower end, underlining the doubt, we shall give it, in oral reading, a heavy emphasis: "I hope to see my Pilot face to face." If we place it at the upper end (as I do), we shall read it very quietly, without emphasis at all, for we are speaking of what we take for granted. To emphasize the word is to emphasize doubt; to speak it quietly is to indicate assurance. The only way to determine its proper emphasis in Tennyson's poem is to examine the context. There are no images of violence in "Crossing the Bar." Tennyson does not threaten to shake his first in God Almighty's face or offer to leap over the cliffs of Dover. The images are images of calm and beauty. "Sunset . . . evening star . . . one clear call . . . such a tide as moving seems asleep, / Too full for sound and foam . . . home . . . twilight . . . evening bell": all of these images suggest ideas of love- liness and peace, undisturbed by doubt and apprehension. Their effect is reinforced by the poet's requesting that there be "no moaning of the bar ... no sadness of farewell."6 Since he is confident of going on to a better world, the poet assures his friends, there is no reason for them to lament his passing. He is returning "home," and will meet his "Pilot face to face." The tone of the poem is serene and untroubled. The words and images combine to define "hope" in terms of confident expectation. Mr. Kincaid devotes a large part of his interpretation to metrical analysis, and makes a good deal of the parallelism in form between the first and third stanzas and the second and fourth. Because the first foot of the first lines of the first and third stanzas is trochaic, and because the first foot of the last line of the second stanza is 6 Mr. Kincaid adduces the words "moaning," "farewell," "sadness," and "dark" as contributing to the impression of depression and gloom. This is hardly fair. The first three words in this series are preceded by negatives; Mr. Kineaid's argument is akin to claiming that a statement such as "It is not at all cold today" leaves an overwhelming impression of coldness. The word "dark" does have im- plications. Tennyson is speaking of the darkness of death, and, like Browning in "Prospice," he does not deny its existence. But by placing it in a series with "twilight" and "evening bell" he softens its impact, suggesting that it is no more to be dreaded than the peaceful night that follows a tranquil day.</page><page sequence="4">130 Victorian Poetry likewise trochaic, he claims, there is created an expectation that the first foot of the last line of the fourth stanza will also be trochaic. This is nonsense. Rhythmical expectations in a poem are created by its basic meter (in this case iambic), not by exceptions to this meter, unless these exceptions are so regular and so extensive as themselves to form a pattern. One exception (e.g. the first foot of the last line in the second stanza) does not create a pattern, and the quasi-pattern detected by Mr. Kincaid is insufficient to establish an expectation for anyone except (ex post facto) a metrical analyst. But this point is of minor importance. The main effect of the parallelism between the first and third stanzas and the second and fourth is to establish a reading for the last two lines of the poem consonant in meaning and tone with that of the last two lines of the second stanza. These two lines- When that which drew from out the boundless deep Turns again home- make a quiet assertion, untainted by protestation, doubt, fear, or negative expression, of the immortality of the soul. That the soul at death "turns again home" (that is, to God) is here simply taken for granted. There is evidence of one characteristically Tennysonian uncertainty in the poem, but it is an uncertainty which Tennyson had become so accustomed to glossing over that it scarcely troubles the surface of the poem. This is an uncertainty not as to the fact but as to the mode of immortality. When Tennyson refers to "that which drew from out the boundless deep" he is referring to his soul, which, upon death, "turns again home"- returns, that is, to "the boundless deep"- the ocean of eternity or of universal spirit. When he says, "I hope to meet my Pilot face to face," he is again referring to his soul (his consciousness; that part of him which survives death), which after death will see its Creator. The first image derives from a pantheistic belief. The soul is referred to by an impersonal pronoun ("which") and is imaged as a droplet of water which at birth is separated from the ocean of boundless spirit and which at death returns to it, merging its separate identity in the divine whole. The second image suggests an anthropomorphic belief. The soul is referred to by a personal pronoun (T); it retains its separate identity after death and greets its Maker "face to face." God, in this reference, is not an ocean but a person- a Pilot with a face. The contradiction of the two images, not obvious to the casual reader and not destructive to the tone of the poem, is nevertheless real, and manifests an unresolved contra- diction in Tennyson's thought. In the Proem to In Memoriam Tenny-</page><page sequence="5">J. M. Gray 131 son addresses God, or the Son of God, as "human and divine, / The highest, holiest manhood," but in Section CXXX of the poem he speaks of Hallam's soul as "a diffusive power, . . . mixed with God and Nature" whose presence is felt in "the rolling air," in running waters, in the rising and setting sun, and "in star and flower." In private conversation, we are told, Tennyson insisted that "our highest view of God must be more or less anthropomorphic." "Take away belief in the self-conscious personality of God," he said, "and you take away the backbone of the world."7 But on another occasion he remarked, "Time is nothing: are we not all part of Deity?"; when accused of pantheism, he replied, "I think I believe in Pantheism, of a sort" (Memoir, I, 514). The contradiction between a god "more or less" anthropomorphic and pantheism "of a sort" finds a muted expression in "Crossing the Bar."8 Tennyson wanted it both ways. But to elevate this confusion into an expression of "frustration-doubt" does violence to the serenity of both images, and indeed of the entire tone of the poem. At the moment of writing this poem at least, Tennyson was serenely confident of some kind of immortality. Southern Methodist University 7 Hallam Lord Tennyson, Alfred Lord Tennyson: A Memoir (London, 1897), I, 311. 0 Kincaid speaks or a conflict between Tennyson s Christian sympathies and his ego: "His hope for eternal life is egocentric, but it rests in a creed which demands eradication of the ego." But the hope for eternal life is itself a Christian hope, and the belief in eternal life is part of Christian belief; if a conflict exists here, it exists in the Christian creed itself. The real conflict in Tennyson was between the Christian-egocentric hope for eternal Me and a scientific materialism which denied this hope. Pantheism was Tennyson's uneasy compromise. It allowed him to believe in some sort of immortality, but not in a sort that promised continuance of the soul as a separate entity. In Section XLVII of In Memoriam he refers to this belief as "a faith as vague as all unsweet," but by the end of that poem he thought he had reconciled himself to it. He hadn't, really.</page></plain_text>
