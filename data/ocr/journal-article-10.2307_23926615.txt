<plain_text><page sequence="1">Heather Pulliam, Word and Image in the Book of Kells. Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2006. Pp. 237; 8 pp. of pis. (5 in color), 98 black-and-white, and line-drawn illus. With the publication of a high-quality color facsimile by Faksimile Verlag, Zurich in 1990, the Book ofKells has become newly accessible to scholars. More over, the manuscript's rich store of minor decoration, previously difficult or impos sible to study comprehensively, has attracted renewed interest. Heather Pulliam's book on the Book of Kelts is one of several recent attempts to understand the func tion and meaning of this remarkable trove of imagery. She focuses particularly on the numerous zoomorphic and anthropomorphic creatures that are found either in the ornamental initials, or as free-standing motifs located in or around the text. Pulliam begins in Part I ("Word and Image") by considering how the minor decoration as a whole contributes to the experience of reading the Gospel text. She notes, as others have before her, that while the elaborate initials and independent sub jects scattered through the manuscript do not correspond to any known fixed system for articulating the Gospels (such as Eusebian divisions or liturgical lection cycles), this decoration does in the aggregate give shape and emphasis to the unfolding story, underscoring and enriching certain sections, modulating the pace of reading, and creating a dramatic visual accompaniment that parallels, and in a sense silently com ments on, the ebb and flow of the narrative. Pulliam makes a number of valid and interesting observations at the outset. She draws attention, for example, to several instances in which animal or human figures in one passage gaze towards or point to a related passage. In similar fashion, she shows that adjacent initials linked together through the interaction or physical entanglement of their animal sometimes signal similar connections between their associated texts. She also offers a useful discussion of the emotional content (humor, anguish) of some of the manuscript's creatures, noting that the theme of animals acting as a Greek chorus to human drama is found also in Irish voyage literature and saints' lives. In Parts II ("Meaning in the Margins") and III ("Necessary Instruments of Salvation"), Pulliam shifts her attention from the general to the specific, construing many of the manuscript's most conspicuous motifs (birds, snakes, human figures, and lion-like quadrupeds), as well as more abstract thematic ideas (linkage, self entanglement) as quite specific allusions to or symbols of the immediately adjacent textual content. In some instances the symbolic intent of individual motifs seems 302 Reviews</page><page sequence="2">beyond question, as for example where a fish substitutes for the more usual hori zontal stroke indicating an abbreviation over a word like "XPS" {Christus). But while many have speculated that some of the manuscript's more enigmatic animals, such as the stylized serpents and feline-like quadrupeds, may be more than just whim sical ornaments, few have ventured to commit themselves so wholeheartedly and comprehensively to specific and literal correlations between specific textual pas sages and their associated images. Pulliam's arguments in the latter two parts of the book are dense and detailed, and many of her assertions regarding particular cases seem straightforward enough at first glance. It is certainly satisfying to learn that the only two initials in which two serpent heads are depicted in parallel, side by side, begin passages describing deceitful behavior. Yet despite Pulliam's many imaginative suggestions, there are serious methodological problems with her approach that impact on her conclusions. Patristic literature, the Bible, and literary sources, like the animal lore pre served in the Physiologus, provide Pulliam with a nearly inexhaustible store of use ful allusions and interpretations. But her associations between the images and these source texts often depend on nothing more than the conventional names (snake, lion) used by modern scholars to designate these creatures. What the Bible or the Fathers or the Physiologus may say about serpents, lions, or doves will only be applicable to the Book ofKells, however, if the creatures we designate with those names were really intended to represent those animals. In some cases, the animals depicted in the manuscript are sufficiently natu ralistic that they cannot with any accuracy be labeled only as generic categories, such as birds. The texts cited by Pulliam often refer to very specific types of birds (such as doves), yet the associated images depict either other types of birds, or birds that do not obviously represent any known species. On the other hand, the predomi nance in these pages of impressively naturalistic raptors (ospreys, eagles) cannot easily be interpreted via Classical and patristic literature and the Bible. As in the case with the other zoomorphic creatures, there is a scale of representation in this manuscript that ranges from the very naturalistic to the entirely fanciful, yet this interesting anomaly—if that is what it is—is neither addressed squarely, nor ac counted for in Pulliam's interpretative method. Among the more problematic creatures are the so-called snakes. These have no parallels in nature, and therefore can have no firm or historically justifiable iden tification—indeed, they could just as easily be eels, seahorses, dragons, or some imaginary creature whose name and nature has long been forgotten. But if we cannot call these serpents, then there is no legitimate way to associate them with any of the serpents and snakes mentioned in the Bible and by the Church Fathers—let alone with moral failings associated with serpents, such as sin or deceit. Studies in Iconography 28 - 2007 303</page><page sequence="3">In fact, their conventional name aside, there is no reason to attribute any neg ative connotations at all to these singular creatures. In contrast to the rodents, cats, quadrupeds, birds, fish, and humans, these snakes never act aggressively towards other creatures and never seem to suffer from the aggressiveness of others—unless being held gently between limbs, or grasped delicately in the mouth of another creature, counts as aggression. They seem devoid of humor, passion, or excitement, and the vast majority remain obediently interlaced in attractive patterns, interacting only rarely with others except with their own kind. Such arbitrary names applied indiscriminately can also lead to morphologi cally distinct animals being tacitly conflated. For example, Pulliam's discussion of the creature on fol. 177v (135) depends entirely on her identification of it as a serpent yet it has four limb-like appendages, the feathered tail of a bird and rounded ears that in Pulliam's drawing look rather like those of a beagle. The obvious differences between different types of these (pseudo-) serpents are not reflected in our termi nology at all. We cannot know what many of the zoomorphs of the Book of Kells would have been called in the eighth century, but some of them are also found carved on Pictish symbol stones. Others, like fish, eagles, and elaborately distorted, interlaced birds and quadrupeds are widespread in the decorative vocabularies of many migra tion-era cultures. Pulliam acknowledges that many of them are widespread in appar ently non-Christian contexts, but she does not follow the logic of that observation, and concludes that the Bible and the exegesis of Church Fathers may not be the most helpful or appropriate guides to the meaning of these enigmatic forms. Before we can safely begin to attribute specifically Christianized meanings to them, we must also consider how little we know about their significance and function in all the con texts in which they occur—many of which are not Christian at all. The other problem with the wholesale use of patristic and biblical sources and things like the Physiologus is that they enable individual motifs to be interpreted in so many ways that the validity of the whole system begins to break down. Pulliam associates the serpents, for example, with the Eucharist and the Resurrection, with passages having to do with the denial of Christ by opponents or his own followers, with sin or sinners, with Jews, with the Crucifixion, and with Christ's descriptions of the signs that will herald the second coming and judgment at the end of time. Birds and bird initials are linked to Christ's identity, his divinity, his betrayal, his Crucifixion, his Resurrection, and/or his Second Coming, as well as to texts that evoke modes of perception (watch, look, listen), or that make "a direct comment on the understanding of the word of God." Human figures entangled in their own limbs, hair, or beards are related to the common biblical topos of the sinner (or Satan) being caught in his own snare. Even such common and ostensibly neutral details as the number of animals in a single initial can be considered literal allusions to a text; 304 Reviews</page><page sequence="4">as for example, on page 73, where the five quadruped heads of an initial are taken as a reference to "the whole crowd of disciples" mentioned in that section of the Gospel (Luke 19:37-8). Pulliam often draws general conclusions about motifs that may or may not represent the same sort of thing. Many, if not most, of the otherwise unidentified human figures and heads, with the exception of the most distorted and entangled ones, are interpreted by Pulliam as either allusions to, or as actual depictions of Christ. Often, human figures or partial figures do occur juxtaposed with passages that refer to Christ in some way—his nature, his deeds, his reception by others, his authority, his return in judgment—though the skeptic might ask whether, aside from the sections that relate events prior to the Nativity, there are many Gospel passages that do not fit this description. But there is also an almost total absence of iconographical justification for identifying so many figures as Christological or as depictions of Christ. The heads— most are no more than that—are, as Pulliam observes, extremely varied in appear ance and age—they may depict full-face, in three-quarter view, or in strict profile; they may be upright, horizontal, or upside down. Hair and beards may be long or short, or the faces may be clean-shaven; and a few even sport long, pointed mus taches. None have any of the attributes that elsewhere in the manuscript are used to identify figures as Christ. The fact that many are shown, like these arresting soldiers, in full profile, is virtual proof that these at least cannot be Christ or allude to Christ, since that view, as Meyer Schapiro has shown, is reserved for figures that for one reason or another do not rate highly on the scale of values—depending on the context they may be frankly evil, merely lowly, or purely decorative, but they are most unlikely to rep resent sacred figures. A decorative intent for many of these figures is also suggested by the exaggerated flourishes extending from various parts of their bodies, such as the spiraling extensions of hair or beards. Pulliam repeatedly reminds us that these symbols are at very least polyvalent. What is more, she often seems uneasily aware of the contradictions and alternative explanations that would tend to undermine her interpretations, and is conscientious about noting these when they come to her attention. She lists, discusses, and illus trates many examples that do not fit easily into her system. For example, on page 77 she describes two linked initials composed of three quadrupeds, two birds, a snake and a fish, all of which are either biting or bitten, grasped or grasping, entangled or entangling—a veritable omnibus of the signifiers to which she devotes most of her attention. The initials, however, introduce two successive passages that narrate re spectively the parables of the lost coin and that of the Prodigal Son, stories that are not particularly related to the themes she elsewhere associates with these animals and motifs—except insofar as nearly all parables are about salvation, sin, redemp Studies in Iconography 28 - 2007 305</page><page sequence="5">tion, and the events of the end of time. (This example also illustrates a slight, but per vasive tendency to inaccuracy, perhaps due to a dearth of careful editing. There are in fact three, not two quadrupeds in these two initials, and the bird grasps the fish in its talons, not in its mouth. These are not grave errors but there are a number of ones like them, and they make navigating Pulliam's text more arduous than it has to be.) Finally, there is another, very important methodological consideration that must be taken into account. The concentration of zoomorphic decoration in only some parts of the manuscript encourages Pulliam to associate certain textual themes with this type of decoration. But the uneven distribution of zoomorphic imagery could equally well be an artifact of the way the book was planned and executed. We do not know how the work was done, or in what order; we do not know how carefully it was planned or whether it grew haphazardly over time. What is certain is that there are many styles and many individual hands at work in the manuscript, only some of whom specialized in zoomorphic decoration. A study of the initials shows that in many cases, a characteristic style, skill level, and working method—suggesting an individual artist or a small group work ing in close collaboration—seem also to be characterized by a distinctive and rela tively restricted repertoire of motifs. Some identifiable artists depicted only birds, others specialized in serpents, humans, or characteristic quadrupeds, and there were also some who restricted their palette to aniconic, abstract motifs. In several cases, characteristic "packages" of stylistic and iconographie features that remain strictly separate in the minor initials are found together in elaborate display pages suggesting that some of these may have been group efforts. It is clear, moreover, that the choice of subject for a given initial or its shape was not necessarily planned for at the outset. In some cases, regularly-shaped rec tangles were left by the scribe for anticipated initials, that were either obediently occupied or ignored by the artists who subsequently executed them. In others, the irregular design of certain initials was anticipated by the scribe, and governed the placement of the text. Thus, we must keep in mind that the distribution of indi vidual motifs may be less than orderly, a function of the way work was distributed to the scribes and artists involved in different parts of the book, possibly at quite different times. The impulse to take this minor decoration seriously is an admirable one, and Pulliam is to be commended for making the attempt. But it is clear that she is labor ing under more than one disadvantage. First, the persuasiveness of her arguments depends on visual evidence, much of which, for economic reasons, she cannot pro vide. Although her book includes a number of photographic plates, including ones in color, most of her illustrations appear to be her own outline drawings. While some of them seem quite faithful, a number are incomplete, difficult to read, or repro 306 Reviews</page><page sequence="6">duced at such a scale that the smaller details are all but illegible. Some of the points made in her text are not illustrated at all. Even at their best, second-hand drawings are never the same as adequate photographs, and therefore a good deal has to be taken on faith. But most of the problems cited here arise most of all because, despite its typeset pages, plates, hard covers and dust jacket, this is—through no fault of its author—more the embryo of a successful book, than a fully realized one. The oppor tunity to be carefully reviewed and edited prior to publication does not seem to have been undertaken. Perhaps the most poignant paragraph in the book was the one in which its author quoted Ernst Kitzinger 's warning against the temptation of indulging in "wild and reckless interpretations" of the enigmatic motifs in Insular art. Indeed, inter preting this material presents a challenge that teaches even the most sophisticated and experienced art historians a lesson in humility. While one may take issue with some of Pulliam's methods and conclusions, one cannot fault her impulse to dig so deeply and venture so much. It is, in the end, a great deal easier to point out what does not bear fruit, than to plant the seeds of future knowledge, as she has done.
