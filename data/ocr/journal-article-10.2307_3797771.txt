<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Audubon Book of True Nature Stories. Se- lected and edited by John K. Terres and illus- trated by Walter W. Ferguson. Thomas Y. Crowell Company, New York. 1958. x+294pp. $6.00. In this volume John K. Terres has brought to- gether 48 tales of wildlife which (with the excep- tion of one) appeared originally in Audubon Magazine during the period 1942-58. At the out- set Terres gives the reader assurance that "every one of these stories is true," thus adding support to the adage that truth may be stranger than fiction. The narratives have been carefully selected and stem from the pens of various authors, a few well known, but the majority are those individuals whose unique experiences with wild creatures have in- duced them to share their good fortune with others. The result is an accumulation of anecdotes on animal behavior, the like of which could enliven, immeasurably, the text of many a life-history mono- graph. Terres has rendered notable service by publishing these literary ana in book form where they will have added permanence. It seems almost incredible, while we are today striving to perpetuate a mere remnant of the whoop- ing crane population, that there was a time when one of these birds performed its fantastic dance with a human being as a partner. How many of us would have believed that a brown thrasher (though one of the Mimidae) could be taught to repeat words and phrases and that one individual had actually a vocabulary of about 90 words? That a sooty tern learned to recognize and respond to the call of an individual person? That a fisher (Martes) used a technique of persistent harass- ment to confuse and tire a porcupine to the point where it appeared helpless to a final attack on its vulnerable underbody? Or that an incubating ptarmigan remained steadfast on its nest though completely covered by a foot or more of snow for several days? Whereas these narratives often concern captive or semicaptive individuals, the responses of these creatures to human association often reveal startling examples of animal behavior. True it is, there are occasions when the reader has to make allowances for anthropomorphic interpretations and, in some contributions, the authors have resorted to gran- diose English when the circumstances called for no such adornment. Terres, of course, is not ac- countable for this. All in all, the compilation makes for entertaining reading-something that can be picked up at any odd moment and at any point. Once in it, the reader is not apt to lay it aside without having encountered something unusual and new to his fund of wildlife knowledge. An appen- dix of notes by the editor concerning authors and their subjects deals with only some of the writers involved. These seem to have been randomly selected. To this reviewer a most captivating feature of this book are the illustrations by Walter W. Ferguson. All too frequently we fail to give de- serving recognition to the art, that, in this case, adds immeasurably, to the volume. Ferguson has done a masterful job in making his delicate wash paintings reflect the tone of the whole compilation. They are refreshingly realistic in their portrayal of incidents set forth in the text. His draftmanship is skillful, even superb with difficult assignments, and is forcibly brought out in his picture of a falling golden eagle shot in flight from a pursuing air- plane (page 278). Ferguson, who is 26 years old, is destined to take a deserving place among the in- creasing number of talented young artists who are now finding their inspiration in wildlife. In so expressing themselves, they are producing for us and those who will follow, something that is, at the same time, instructional, inspirational and, with- al, something that is universally understandable. May their clan increase and reach even greater heights of performance! With that, this reviewer ventures the prediction that a cursory glance through The Audubon Book of True Nature Stories with its superb illustrations, will inevitably lead to the reading of a few snatches. These, in turn, are apt to end in the book finding a place in one's library.--E. R. KALMBACH, 1601 Mariposa Ave., Boulder, Colo.</page></plain_text>
