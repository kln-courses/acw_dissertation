Bertram Dobell's memoir of the poet makes several mentions of it, as do critics of his work such as Robert Crawford, Edwin Morgan, and William Sharpe.1 Although widely acknowledged and noted as a significant biographical detail by critics, Thomson's insomnia has not been examined in terms of its relation to the specifically apocalyptic tone in some of his work. It is this curious relationship and its implications for the reading of his long poem The City of Dreadful Night which form the focus of this paper. Thomson often wrote about sleep - the lack of it and the desire for it. "The Sleeper," for example, is an envious and touching description of a woman drowsing and then falling into "slumber deep," "Deep sleep, so holy in its calm." The final stanza is particularly telling Sweet sleep; no hope, no fear, no strife; The solemn sanctity of death, With all the loveliest bloom of life; Eternal peace in mortal breath: Pure sleep from which she will awaken Refreshed as one who hath partaken New strength, new hope, new love, new faith. (78-84) Renewed by sleep here, in Dreadful Night hope, love, and faith are beyond renewal. This becomes clear in section II, where the narrator recounts a meeting with a figure who moves through the city in endless circles, repeatedly revisiting the sites where in his experience each of these human propensities has died: "Perpetual recurrence in the scope / Of but three terms, dead Faith, dead love, dead hope" (11.47-48). "The Sleeper" encodes an odd kind of wonder that sleep so deep and refreshing, so death-like yet so invigorating, could be impermanent. The lines "Pure sleep from which she will awaken / Refreshed as one who hath partaken," 121</page><page sequence="2">1 22 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE show unbroken syntax, and yet the line break is slightly shocking in its tendency to make the reader focus on the fact that the sleeper will awake. For those of us fortunate enough not to be troubled by insomnia, the observation is banal. In fact, the whole poem is shocking for just that reason - the fascination with the sleeping figure indicates a degree of alienation in the narrator from the normal human experience of sleep. The City of Dreadful Night takes this alienation into a far more advanced state in its longing for a sleep that will never be disturbed, from which the sleeper will not awake. Obviously, this sleep is death, viewed as an end to the chaotic experience of insomnia. Such a promise, however, is threatened by the Christian message in the Gospels and their apocalyptic coda in their assertion of life after death, of being roused from the grave to face judgement. What was intended as a possibility, in Thomson's poem takes on instead the character of a threat, becoming the focus of an anti-gospel, preached in a de-sacralised cathedral - the gospel of eternal death: "This little life is all we must endure, / The grave's most holy peace is ever sure, / We fall asleep and never wake again" (XIV.49-51). "You are free," the preacher tells his "melancholy Brothers," "to end it when you will, / Without the fear of waking after death" (83-84). This freedom is predicated upon atheism: "There is no God; no Fiend with names divine" (40). Suicide is a way out only if one can be sure that one will not be called to account for it on the other side of the grave. Or, in Thomson's terms, there is escape from insomnia in death only if one's final sleep is not likely to be disturbed. Sleep, death, and the desire for resolution coalesce on a number of occasions in Dreadful Night. We are told early on that The City is of Night, but not of Sleep; There sweet sleep is not for the weary brain; The pitiless hours like years and ages creep, A night seems termless hell (1.71-74) In section V, there is a clearer echo of "The Sleeper," which strongly suggests that the city is, at one level at least, a metaphor for the insomniac condition: . . . there comes a morn When he awakes from slumbering so sweetly That all the world is changed for him completely, And he is verily as if new-born (V.I 0-1 4) Here, the desire for resolution denied by sleeplessness falls easily into the religious language of a rebirth that completely changes the world, in stark contrast to the "termless hell" of section I and the longing for eternal death expressed in section XIV. Thomson's correspondence suggests that he was well aware that insomnia divided the truth in two in this way. Writing to George Eliot, for example, responding to her complaint of the pessimism of Dreadful Night, Thomson was explicit about both the insomnia out of which the poem was born, and the bifurcation of perception which it engendered: "The poem in question was the outcome of much sleepless hypochondria. I am aware that the truth of midnight does not exclude the truth of noonday, though one's nature may lead him to dwell in the former rather than the latter" (qtd. in Dobell lxiii). Dwelling in the "truth of midnight" might serve as a description of much of the poem, but, as we have seen, the possibility of the "truth of</page><page sequence="3">The Truth of Midnight 1 23 noonday" is not entirely absent. These two truths are two versions of apocalypse - rebirth versus chaos.2 Sleep and the lack of it shape the images and rhetoric of the poem throughout. "Weary" is the most frequently used adjective, and death is habitually described as sleep: "that sweet sleep no power can ever banish, / That one best sleep which never wakes again" (XIX.34-35). Sleep offers a kind of ending, a resolution to the images of circling and repetition such as the "perpetual recurrence" of section II, the blindly whirling mill of section VIII (40), and the circling of section XIII. It might be appropriate to recall at this point that the prophetic utterances of both the Hebrew and Christian Bibles employ sleep as a metaphor for spiritual and moral decline. "Awake!" is an oft-repeated alarm call, not only in Isaiah and Joel, but also in Romans, Ephesians, and Revelation. Such disturbing imperatives seem to underlie the sermon in section XIV, with its proclamation of rest for the weary and "solace" for "wild unrest" (36). It is clear that biblical religion evoked by such lines is too wakeful for the insomniac poet to bear, saturated as are he and his poem by sleep deprivation. In turning from the eternal rest, promised by the Christian gospel and by the apocalyptic vision of the blessed, towards a desire for personal release in the extinction of death, Thomson is moving from a perception of the end as imminent to one of the end as immanent, recasting apocalypse as an individual release from unchallenged chaos rather than as its final overthrow. It is possible, of course, to read Thomson's treatment of sleep in Dreadful Night rather differently, as William Sharpe has done: The controlled anger that engenders the poem consistently opposes the sleep, suicide and death which the work at first seems to praise. Rather, the poet's harsh honesty acts like cold water dashed over the heads of the drugged and weary automatons the City creates Insisting on the power of poetry to keep the denizens of his city wide awake, the poet argues that the only responsible attitude toward life lies in the conscious experience of it, in the process of speaking the truth - (Sharpe 68) Since this reading ignores evidence from poems such as "The Sleeper" and "Insomnia," from biographical information, and from the kind of internal detail adduced here it might appear somewhat tendentious. There seems to me to be little evidence that Thomson is asserting the life-affirming "power of poetry" which Sharpe wants to see in the poem. Sleep is too positive a force in Thomson's work for him to have thought of it in biblical terms as a moral failing. Take the poem "Insomnia" for example, with its ironic epigraph taken from Psalm 127: "He giveth his beloved sleep." The poem speaks of "Sleep's fine alchemy" and its "transmuting" (4, 5) power that can deliver one from "the world of toil and care and strife" (10), of "Sleep's divine oblivion and repose" (12), and of the narrator's "infinite weariness" that leaves him "haggard with endless nights unblessed by sleep" (21, 22). For Sharpe 's point to be valid, Thomson would have had to shuttle between these two opposed images of sleep in a poem which, according to the poet's own testimony, was the product of much sleeplessness. It seems unlikely that a sufferer from chronic insomnia would ever have pronounced the prophetic "Awake!" over "the City's sleepless sleep" (XIX.8), or used the longed-for respite as an image of social and moral decay. Sharpe goes on to argue that Thomson's City is "a nightmare from which one cannot wake" - that the city represents the real condition of the new urban world (83). But this does not attend closely enough to either the "truth of noonday" in the poem, nor to the fact that the</page><page sequence="4">1 24 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE problem Thomson faced was the very one of being awake when everyone else was asleep. As he put it in "Insomnia": I heard the sounding of the midnight hour; The others one by one had left the room, In calm assurance that the gracious power Of Sleep's fine alchemy would bless the gloom. (1-4) Again, as in "The Sleeper," one is shocked by the way in which so mundane a sight as people going to bed calmly assured of sleeping is turned into a moment of alienation for the narrator. And this is precisely the kind of alienation endemic in Thomson's nocturnal city - its inhabitants are those who hear the sounding of the midnight hour as though it were an early morning alarm call. Certainly, Dreadful Night contains elements of a critique of urban squalor in its depictions of down-and-outs and street-dwellers, but this vision is engendered by insomnia, and the personal debility is not entirely separable from the material conditions observed by the narrator. Sleepless eyes perceive a world which might exist beyond the weary brain or might not: "For life is but a dream whose shapes return, / Some frequently, some seldom, some by night / And some by day, some night and day" (1.15-17). The problem with taking too clear- eyed a view of the City (too Sharpe a view, one might say) is that night and day are merged: the truth of midnight and the truth of noonday do not remain discrete, so one can never view the city in either undifferentiated light or darkness. This problem is itself the product of insomnia. In order to elucidate this further and to relate it more closely to apocalypse, it will be useful to consider briefly Emmanuel Levinas's interpretation of insomnia. Wakefulness without Intentionality FOR THOMSON, as we have seen, insomnia was a termless wandering, which opened up a chaotic desert region beyond the categories of ordinary experience. When others sleep, the narrator of "Insomnia" finds himself "plunging" into "despairs unfathomably deep" as he wanders "Into the desert vastitude of Night, / Arid, wild and black" (24-27). This condition is precisely the terror engendered by the prospect of time without end: Utter despair foresees no termination, But feels itself of infinite duration; The smallest fragment instant comprehends the whole. The absolute of torture as of bliss Is timeless, each transcending time and space. (48-52) The dark, seemingly endless hours propel one into a realm of "deep ravines," "torrent brooks," "icy bleakness," "tangled roots," "awful scarps," and "arid sand and gravel" (1 15-39) - in short, a wilderness, a "chaos of demoniacal possession" (179). Insomnia returns the subject to that disordered and endless world, to a pre-cognitive condition. The poem "Insomnia," like Dreadful Night, is a form of apocalypse - a narrative that attempts to re-order and so control the condition it describes, curtailing the timelessness and infinite duration of its theme by imposing upon them the closure of rhyme, rhythm, and narrative coherence.</page><page sequence="5">The Truth of Midnight 1 25 Much more than a trying and exhausting ailment, then, insomnia is a falling out of the cosmos - the ordered world of human categories and experience - an irruption of alterity within consciousness. Writing of the condition in relation to another Victorian insomniac, Charles Dickens, Timothy Clark draws on Levinas in his description, "It is a matter of an exteriority of the inward that may be read as confirming an anti-Kantian view of subjectivity as a heteronomy, an opening to exteriority. Here the impersonal overrides the personal at the very heart of personality, breaking down the distinctions between interiority and exteriority" (31). Narrative concordance, in its dependence upon a distinction between the tale and the teller, is suspended by this disjunction since the latter collapses the perspectival rendering of temporal processes, erasing the distance demanded and entailed by perspective. Insomnia, then, runs counter to narrative and resists narration. Narratives of insomnia are necessarily stories of the end since they ply the border between the narratable and the non-narratable, creating an irresolvable tension between order and chaos. Dreadful Night manifests precisely this tension in its depiction of a city which is not only surrounded by wilderness but has the wilderness at its heart. In breaking down the distinction between the city and the desert, Thomson's poem reveals its insomniacal roots, mapping the interface between consciousness and its other. In "God and Philosophy" Levinas says that, for Western rationality, being is manifested in doing, and it is this manifestation that renders being intelligible. Such a formation, the argument goes, presupposes that knowing is an interior reflection of an exterior reality, so insomnia's collapsing of the interior/exterior distinction constitutes the confounding of knowledge. Knowledge, in fact, in this economy, involves the forgetting of consciousness as a question prior to epistemology. The specificity of consciousness is lost under the concept of knowing, yet knowing "presupposes consciousness" (169). So consciousness, in Levinas' words, is a "modification of insomnia," an epiphenomenon, or, more precisely, a palimpsest which never fully covers over what lies beneath. More than mere sleep-deprivation, insomnia subtends and conditions the appearance of consciousness: "Insomnia is wakefulness, but a wakefulness without intentionality, disinterested Consciousness has already broken with this disinterestedness" (170). Consciousness modifies insomnia by virtue of its interestedness, first of all in itself; its self- presence distances it from objects which it constitutes as exterior targets of its intentional reflection. Wanderers in Thomson's city seem to move outside of the categories of knowledge produced by such reflection, "transcending time and space": . . . worn faces that look deaf and blind Like tragic masks of stone. With weary tread, Each wrapt in his own doom, they wander, wander, Or sit fordone and desolately ponder Through sleepless hours with heavy drooping head ******* The pitiless hours like years and ages creep, A night seems termless hell. This dreadful strain Of thought and consciousness which never ceases, Or which some moments stupor but increases, This, worse than woe, makes wretches there insane (1.52-56, 73-77) Thought and consciousness are equated with sleeplessness, here, in a formulation that runs counter to the Levinasian description. Yet the wanderers are also described in terms of the</page><page sequence="6">126 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE inanimate and of sensory alienation bordering on objecthood; they also move towards a loss of reason by virtue of the unending consciousness from which they seek the escape of sleep - they are made insane. So insomnia does serve in a Levinasian function: its irruption within consciousness suggests the dependence of reason and its categories upon the other of consciousness. The preconscious, object-like condition of termless wandering recalls the primordial transience underlying self-awareness, against which the intentional wakefulness of knowledge defines itself. It recalls too that chaos which threatens civilisation and order, giving rise to apocalypse. Thus the poem encodes a paradoxical apocalypse that resists the gospel-apocalypse story of divine teleology yet resonates with a longing for closure, be it the renewal afforded by sleep or the annihilation promised by death in a Darwinian universe. Thomson's insomnia was, of course, a debilitating and destructive ailment that ought not to be reduced to a mere interpretative category. Nevertheless, it is a highly significant feature of his work that has gone largely unexplored in relation to his frequently noted apocalyptic tone. Nor was its destructiveness - psychological, emotional, and physical - the whole story; the converse should also be asserted: insomnia was productive in Thomson's experience, serving as the dark space out of which much of his imaginative writing emerged. It served as a kind of Levinasian meta-category, modified by poetic consciousness and driving the apocalyptic search for a conclusion. Which is to say that if consciousness is thought of as a self-presence that overlies a precognitive substrate, then insomnia represents the occasional irruption of that substrate, as it forces its way up to the surface, disrupting consciousness. In this light, Thomson's imposition of narrative order upon such experiences of inner alterity casts Dreadful Night as a myth against chaos that imposes a post hoc diegetic order on the limitlessness of undirected wandering. To lack the self-awareness of consciousness is to be unaware of one's own mortality. Narrative uncovers what insomnia covers over - the immanent end. But it also uncovers insomnia itself. It is thus both apocalyptic and anti-apocalyptic, a revelation and a concealment, uncovering both the necessity for and the impossibility of the end. Man-evolving Doom FURTHER EVIDENCE for the duality of Thomson's apocalyptic perspective in Dreadful Night can be found in its Darwinian intimations. Peter C. Noel-Bentley has argued that Thomson's spiritual journey from "orthodox Calvinist" to "despairing atheist" is evident in the differences between "The Doom of a City" (1857) and The City of Dreadful Night (1874). The religious change is a matter, for Noel-Bentley at least, of replacing Calvinist determinism with Darwinian determinism: He transferred his dogmatic approach to belief onto science and by doing so transferred the locus of determinism from an essentially benevolent, anthropomorphic, teleological God to an uncaring, non-human, volitionless, and purposeless mechanism Thomson's religious assumptions never changed: without personal immortality life can have no meaning Evolutionary science allowed no personal immortality, so life for Thomson came to have no meaning. (194) Noel-Bentley may be right about Thomson's perception of the meaninglessness of mortal existence, but this is, at best, only half the story. It is clear from the sermon in section XIV, and from a number of other places in the poem, that the thought of extinction is precisely what</page><page sequence="7">The Truth of Midnight 1 27 makes life bearable - it promises an end to meaningless existence. By now, the apocalyptic duality already discussed should be apparent: evolutionary theory both removes apocalyptic certainty and, at the same time, offers the kind of undisturbed eternal rest that the insomniac craves. Clearly, a Darwinian world is one in which time no longer appears narratable; it is characterised by the very termlessness that makes insomnia so excruciating. Evolutionary time is non-human time that makes of history a relatively new idea, dwarfed and paled by the sheer chaotic vastness of what we now (imposing our will-to-narrative on the formless) call prehistory. Of more significance for Thomson's poem is that this opening up of pre-human, insomniac time is also the closing down of eternal life as an unwelcome disturbance of death's "sweet sleep." If Darwinian evolution means that the Bible's narrative of beginnings is to be rejected, then we are free to question its narrative of the end, and this, it seems to me, is the one crumb of comfort for those who listen to the sermon in section XIV. The apocalyptic paradox associated with evolutionary science is profoundly connected with the interest in statue-like images which are the focus of Noel-Bentley's discussion. Lapidary figures appear in many of Thomson's poems, figuring objectified human bodies and often associated with sleep, stupor, or death. These images are not distinct, of course; they all cluster around insomnia and its effects. In "The Doom of a City" (another narrative poem that begins with a journey occasioned by a sleepless night), the "doom" of the title is the petrification of the city's inhabitants in a straightforward act of divine judgement. But petrification and its cognate processes do not remain within the ambit of the divine prerogative. The fifth stanza of "The Sleeper" describes the slumbering woman as though she were a sculpted form, fashioned not from stone but from porcelain: The contour of her cheek and chin Is curved in one delicious line, Pure as a vase of porcelain thin Through which a tender light may shine; Her brow and blue-veined temple gleaming Beneath the dusk of hair back-streaming Are as a virgin's shrine. (29-35) Porcelain, of course, is a malleable substance that can be fashioned and ossified into static forms. So, the woman in the poem is likened to a figure that has undergone a process of hardening and fixing akin to petrification. Despite the fact that this is a human rather than a divine process, the woman's static and lifeless beauty is rendered iconic by a clever play on words that makes a "shrine" of her "temple." That porcelain can be manipulated by human processes into immobile shapes makes it particularly suitable to serve as a mediating substance between the temple as flesh (forehead) and as lifeless structure (shrine). Even the comparatively cheerful and life-affirming "Sunday Up the River" includes images of statuary form: Yet look how here and there Soft curves, fine contours, seem to swim, Half emerging, wan and dim, Into the quiet air: Like statues growing slowly, slowly out</page><page sequence="8">1 28 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE From the great vault of marble; here a limb, And there a feature, but the rest all doubt. The sculpturing sunbeams smite, And the forms start forth to the day. (III. 15-23) The ease with which Thomson slips into these metaphors of petrified stasis is again evident in the poem when we encounter "a tideless sea of infinite fathomless rest" (111.35) and water "clear as crystal" (VIII.2). If we are tempted to dismiss the latter as no more than a careless cliche into which it would be a mistake to read too much, the poem ends with its apocalyptic significance: What time is it, dear, now? We are in the year now Of the New Creation one million two or three. But where are now, Love? We are as I trow, Love, In the Heaven of Heavens upon the Crystal Sea. (XX.25-30) Here, frozen time takes on an anti-insomniac quality. It is the Christian vision of eternity that turns the sea to glass. But Dreadful Night, as we have seen, rejects this possibility for what Noel-Bentley characterises as Darwinian, or at least evolutionary, reasons. Evolutionary thought offers not only the escape of eternal death but also the prospect of a non-apocalyptic end: the extinction of human life as one species among many that arise and pass away. One indication of this in Dreadful Night can be read in section XX, describing perhaps the most famous of Thomson's statuary images - the mortal confrontation between the angel and the Sphinx.3 Towards the end of the poem, the narrator, weary with his nighttime peregrinations, sits to rest before the cathedral: "The great cathedral's western front stood there, / A wave-worn rock in that calm sea of air" (5-6). Geological time is evoked and pitted against theological/ecclesial time in this image. Thomson telescopes images of erosion, time, and religion by comparing the cathedral's western elevation to an eroding cliff face, neatly suggesting in a single metaphor both the decline of religious certainty and the (scientific) causes of that decline. The image of the angel performs a similar contraction, collapsing into the disintegrating figure the evolutionary demise of religion and of humankind. What the narrator sees, at first, is described thus: "Two figures faced each other, large, austere; / A couchant sphinx in shadow to the breast, / An angel standing in the moonlight clear" (8-10). The angel is armed with a "naked sword," the cross-hilt of which hints at the symbolism of its imminent collapse. As the narrator dozes fitfully, the angel is gradually reduced from armed angel (13-14) to "warrior" (27), to "unarmed man" (34), as parts of its form fall to the ground. Eventually, it is reduced to "shattered" masonry (40), lying between the paws of the implacable sphinx. That the wrecked form begins as a statue should not escape our attention, nor should the fact that each stage of its collapse occurs as the narrator dozes. It is the sound of crumbling masonry that recalls him from his shallow slumber. Insomnia is intimately linked with the process of evolutionary decline because what is in view is the nature and scope of human consciousness, its fragility, and the chaos that lies just beneath its surface. The sphinx, after all, is a desert creature whose presence in the city threatens apocalyptic destruction</page><page sequence="9">The Truth of Midnight 1 29 unless human wit can overcome the danger by solving the riddle whose answer is, precisely, mankind: the existence of the species depends upon its self-consciousness here, upon self- recognition. It is the desert itself, the region where chaos rules, that poses the riddle - can the human remain human, defining itself against the encroaching chaos represented by the Sphinx? If the Sphinx wins out, then humanity's very existence is threatened by disorder and evolutionary reversal - angel, warrior, man, non-sentient rubble. Such an interpretation is suggested not only by the detail of section XX but also by what precedes and what follows it. Section XVIII describes an encounter between the narrator and a creature which once "had been a man" (20). The sub-human being crawls along on all fours, a stage further down the evolutionary scale than the narrator, who describes himself as having "frame downbent" (10) (stages suggestive, of course, of the riddle of the Sphinx). This crawling creature displays animal hostility and territorial wariness, fearing that the narrator wants his "prize" (27) and threatening to kill him to protect it. His search is for "the long-lost broken golden thread / Which unites [his] present with [his] past" (50-51). At the ontogenetic level, this cord is umbilical and represents the desire to return to the womb, to the bliss of preconsciousness, to Levinas's state of undifferentiated "wakefulness without intentionality." This is not the desired bliss of sleep but is, in fact, uncomfortably close to the insomniac condition. Yet it is also a condition that relieves the subject of the burden of consciousness. So, one could argue that in its depiction of the contrasting desires for sleep and for preconscious existence, Dreadful Night characterises the problem of insomnia as the agony of shuttling back and forth between states - of being painfully conscious of one's lapses into preconsciousness, of being caught between humanity and inhumanity, between subjecthood and objecthood. But the presence of the Sphinx and the Darwinian intimations in the poem suggest that the cord should also be understood phylogenetically, as the thread of life itself - the evolutionary chain which connects humanity with its pre-cognitive past and with a possibly post-cognitive future. That the creature seeks an alternative to an animalistic future is suggested in the penultimate stanza: "He should to antenatal night retrace / And hide his elements in that large womb / Beyond the reach of man-evolving Doom" (70-72). Both ontogenesis and phylogenesis are in view in these lines in the form of the womb and the evolutionary process respectively, confirming the double significance of the "long-lost broken golden thread." There have been earlier intimations that the future might see the decline of mankind, if not of life on earth in general. In section VIII, for example, a mechanistic universe renders apocalyptic prediction impossible, but its demise remains a hidden possibility: "The mill must blindly whirl unresting so: / It may be wearing out, but who can know?" (40-41). This is later translated into the (then relatively new) language of thermodynamics and the projection of entropic decline: These eyes of sightless heaven. . . If we could near them with the flight unknown, We should but find them worlds as sad as this, Or suns all self-consuming like our own (XVII. 16-24) A few lines further on such scientific perceptions empty out religious cosmology, mocking the Dantean vision of theocentric fullness and divine order: "The empyrean is a void abyss"</page><page sequence="10">1 30 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE (28). Science, like insomnia, effects a decreation which returns the blindly whirling mill of cosmic time to a precreation chaos: the "infinite void space" (48). The eroded cathedral and the crumbling angel can be read as re-statements of this theme. What follows the confrontation between the angel and the Sphinx is the description of Durer's "Melencolia" as the deity presiding over the city. A curious disjuncture here makes Thomson's description both highly visual and unvisualisable at the same time in that it is a detailed verbal portrait of an engraving which the reader is required to imagine as a three- dimensional statue: "The bronze colossus of a winged woman, / Upon a graded granite base foursquare" (XXI.6-7). The poem itself draws attention to the difficulty: "Words cannot picture her; but all men know / That solemn sketch the pure sad artist wrought / Three centuries and threescore years ago" (15-17). A two-dimensional image, then, gives rise to two impossible representations: the verbal description and the three-dimensional form. One can sense in this mimetic crisis the disordering of the senses which the city (and the condition of insomnia) produces. Yet Thomson's disordered image is surrounded by suggestions of scientific law and mathematical order, as Noel-Bentley observes: Around Melencolia are scientific, specifically geometric instruments. She has measured time and space and has detected evidence in her measurements of a cosmic law (Fate) which cares nothing for men, evidence of an expanse of time which negates humankind's puny little expanse of existence. . . (197) Noel-Bentley 's description actually relates to the description of Durer's work in another Thomson poem, "The Melencolia of Albrecht Durer," but the point remains: compasses, scales, hour-glass, bell, and magic square are all present in Dreadful Night's description, and Melencolia sits "Fronting the dreadful mysteries of Time" (46) here, as in the shorter poem. Measurement, investigation, and knowledge give way to the insomniac condition which disorders the world, leaving the instruments of science redundant. Noel-Bentley, it seems, is right to point to Thomson's reading of The Origin of Species in this regard as that which "confirmed his religious fears" (196). It was the theory of natural selection, above all, that banished both temporal and spiritual horizons in the mid century and that transplanted into the ordered universe of ecclesial/biblical time the seed of chaos - the prospect of non-narratable time. In "The Melencolia of Albrecht Durer," Thomson actually compares the figure of Melencolia with the Sphinx in terms of their common gaze, or "eternal trance" (13). It is no coincidence, then, that the description of Melencolia in section XXI should follow on from the reference to the Sphinx's gaze at the end of section XX: "I pondered long that cold majestic face / Whose vision seemed of infinite void space" (47-48). Melencolia's gaze, here, again reflects the vision/non-vision aporia suggested by her impossible mode of representation: "she gazes / With full set eyes, but wandering in thick mazes / Of sombre thought beholds no outward sight" (XXI.12-14). The words "beholds no outward sight" evoke the insomniac condition which Thomson repeatedly associates with petrification or statues in so much of his work. Mazing thought - directionless wandering, disorderly and blind - opens the same kind of void space as that which is evoked by the Sphinx's vision: a desert in the heart of the city. Given these intimations, we should not wonder that both Sphinx and Melencolia are caught between species, each representing some sort of missing link: the Sphinx unites</page><page sequence="11">The Truth of Midnight 1 3 1 human and beast, Melencolia human and divine (her form is colossal, winged, "superhuman"; XXI.5). The facts that Melencolia's wings are folded, that the angel phatically disintegrates, and that the Sphinx is said tq.be "supreme" (XX.46) may suggest a de-evolutionary process before which "infinite void space" stretches in anti-apocalyptic gloom. Yet the wonderful paradox with which the poem ends, with Melencolia's subjects circling before her, would imply that this very anti-apocalyptic notion cannot be sustained. A kind of narrative closure can be seen to reassert itself in the final lines: Her subjects often gaze up to her there: The strong to drink new strength of iron endurance, The weak new terrors; all renewed assurance And confirmation of the old despair (XXI.81-84) Renewal is a form of resolution; assurance and confirmation are precisely what constitute narrative ends, even if these modes of assertion are directed towards negative goals. And what is the old despair if not the insomniac's terror of sleeplessness, perpetual disturbance, waking after death? Thus, the Sphinx is indeed supreme, yet the divine/human Melencolia remains the presiding genius. Is this because the Sphinx's vision of "infinite void space" is unendurable and cries out for closure, for assurance, for confirmation, even if that confirmation is nothing but reiteration? Reiteration implies pattern, order, and narrative. Furthermore, if the city represents insomnia, then the post-Darwinian decline embedded in its narrative is internally resisted by the desire for sleep in its guise as an isotope of apocalypse. Sleep would represent the end of the city, its vanishing point. The city of dreadful night, then, is also that archetypal doomed city that John calls Babylon, also known as Rome. It is also the New Rome, London - or any modern city that never sleeps. Real Night While revelation, in common with other apocalyptic literature, thematises the relationship between the desert and the city, making the threat of encroaching chaos a trait definitive of the genre, it also shows the permeability of the border between them. Throughout Dreadful Night there are reminders of this permeability. The city is bounded part by desert, part by ocean - both biblical, apocalyptic images of the disorder against which the ramparts of civilisation are shored: A trackless wilderness rolls north and west, Savannahs, savage woods, enormous mountains, Bleak uplands, black ravines with torrent fountains; And eastward rolls the shipless sea's unrest (1.32-35) Right away, there are clear signs that the city cannot keep the wilderness at bay. Immediately following on from the lines just quoted, we read: The City is not ruinous, although Great ruins of an unremembered past, With others of a few short years ago More sad, are found within its precincts vast (36-39)</page><page sequence="12">1 32 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE The proximity of ancient and recent ruins is indicative of a continuing process of desertification within the precincts of the city. Not merely contiguous with its other, the city is infected with its ruinous presence, to the extent that narrative order itself is under threat from a rupture in the fabric of human history. Material signs of "an unremembered past" both posit and disrupt the succession of generations crucial to narrative order, while their proximity to more recent ruins sets up a potentially destructive reverberation.4 Recent ruins become monuments to monumentality itself, echoing the loss of memory and petrifying narrative into unreadable signs of an unrecoverable order. Desert and city remain distinct, each holding onto its name, each definitive of the other, yet both rendered violable by insomnia; the founding distinctions of culture are affected virally by the exchange. In section III, the frontier between life and death is seen to have been breached by insomnia, so that "The lanes are black as subterranean lairs" (7), and the eye of the neophyte "Sees spectres also in the gloom intense" (14). In this region of compromised defences "Death-in-life is the eternal king" (25). From this point on, spectral, disorderly, and phantasmagorical images abound, from the narrative of desert wanderings recounted in section IV, with its deathly and horrific images of "fleshless fingers," "eyeless sockets" and dripping hearts held in the hand, to the "bodiless voices" of section VI (21, 56, 11), the "phantoms" of section VII (1), and the "spectral wanderers of unholy Night" of section XIV (27). The desert has seeped into the city. Emerging from the dissolution of the distinction between night and day inherent in insomnia, the breakdown of order that collapses the founding binaries of civilisation feeds directly into the mixing of species observed in the latter stages of the poem: humanity is subject to the same kind of slippage as are our concepts. This is, more or less, what the sermon of section XIV brings to light: the infinitude that both threatens narrative cogency and, paradoxically, offers closure to the terrors of insomniac temporality: "Infinite aeons ere our kind began; / Infinite aeons after the last man / Has joined the mammoth in the earth's tomb and womb" (58-60). Repetition of the phrase "infinite aeons" on either side of "our kind" evokes a sense of both (en)closure and infinity at one and the same time, while the internal rhyming of "tomb" and "womb" neatly summarises the paradox by making beginnings and endings consonant, thus imposing an impossible narrative order on the infinite eons which exceed human temporality. In John's Apocalypse, the imposition of an impossible narrative order is a matter of revelation: Christ uncovers before John's eyes the conflict taking place in regions beyond normal human perceptions in order to explain the disorder of history as perceived at ground level. In Thomson's poem, the effect is reversed: the order of normality (of the day) is revealed by the city of night to be no more than a "certain seeming order" (1.20). Denizens of the city see beneath this semblance to the underlying chaos, each testifying from what daydreams they have awoken "to this real night" (section XII). Civilisation is systematically unpicked in section XII, as representatives of politics, intellectual endeavour, entertainment, religion, law, art, poetry, and the military, one by one, come to realise that their world is an illusion grounded in darkness and covering over an abysmal emptiness. It is precisely in this sense that the poem is anti-apocalyptic, reversing the polarities of chaos and order and inverting narrative hope in order to replace millenarian vision with "confirmation of the old despair" (XXI.84). Among those who awaken "from daydreams to this real night" in section XII, is a Christian evangelist:</page><page sequence="13">The Truth of Midnight 133 From preaching to an audience fired with faith The Lamb who died to save our soul from death, Whose blood hath washed our scarlet sins wool-white: I wake from daydreams to this real night (33-36). Played out in various forms of christological and ecclesiological parody, which serve the ends of the anti-gospel, the inversion of apocalypse is nowhere made clearer than in these lines. The figure of the slain Lamb and the washing of the saints' garments in his blood come directly from the pages of John's visionary text. Here, John's visions are as daydreams by comparison with the real night which the insomniac inhabits and which nighttime wanderings reveal beneath the surface of the daytime streets. Thomson's parodies serve the ends of their anti-gospel message by taking on the central metaphor of gospel-apocalyptic tropology - the imagery of desert and city - and by repeating the values inherent in the structuring opposition: the valorisation of city/civilisation and the devaluing or even demonising of the desert. The opposition belongs to a family of tropes which structure culture and its criticism as a whole, according to Geoffrey Gait Harpham. His book, The Ascetic Imperative, argues, inter alia, that the ascetic desert fathers produced the founding tropes of culture by envisaging its alternative - self-abnegation and desert dwelling. Opposed to culture and the city, the desert was the site of demonic torment and trial, but also of purity in being removed from the temptations of the city. Thomson's city is both city and desert - an apocalyptic space in which civilisation both is and is not its opposite. Robert Crawford sees in this proximity of desert and city an echo of Dante: Dante enters Hell from a "gran diserto" (1.64), while Thomson's speaker of the famous passage with the refrain, "As I came through the desert thus it was" (IV) has entered Thomson's city from a similar locale. The idea of the circles of Dante's Hell where one of the punishments is "roaming incessantly" (XIV.24) contributes also to the homeless wanderings of the inhabitants of Thomson's city (33) The echo of Dante is clear enough, but Thomson's cosmology, as we have already noted, empties out the Dantean universe, making of it a "void abyss" - the city is not a vision of punishment but an imaginative evocation of infernal terror at the heart of day-to-day (or night-to-night) reality. Dantean intimations, then, serve as indications of the breakdown of the order that structures the Christian universe, subjecting it to apocalyptic decreation. This is why the desert and the city are not in close-but-discrete proximity to each other but are actually interwoven and interdependent. The insomniac occupies this space like a latter-day ascetic who involuntarily suffers continual acedia and self-abnegation. The city is a non-site, an impossible margin - distinct from the desert beyond its precincts and yet its topography and citizenry reveal the illusory character of the seeming order that structures the opposition. It may be, then, that such attempts to rework the gospel-apocalypse nexus can only posit atopia. Their mise en scene is a non-site because culture itself, as Harpham shows, is articulated by the very distinction that apocalypse encodes - order versus chaos, desert versus city - and the trial of strength between these modes of existence forms the core of apocalyptic thought. Insomnia, in this light, is an instanciation of the immanent apocalyptic moment - a confrontation or (non)engagement between narrative order and the experiential collapse that is its other. Thomson's text stages just such a moment; it is itself the product of insomnia in conflict with the consciousness into which and out of which the latter irrupts</page><page sequence="14">1 34 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE and recedes, producing both apocalypse and anti-apocalypse. What makes Dreadful Night so powerful and enduring is that its complex interweaving of apocalypse and its opposite resists both the belligerent optimism inherent in certain cultural events and discourses of the age and the straightforwardly apocalyptic alternative of the doom sayers like Carlyle. It brings to light the tension inherent in both modes of idealism by confronting them with what lies beneath the surface of the city as symbol of both progress and hubris. Paradoxically, it is at its most apocalyptic and most anti-apocalyptic in this gesture of unveiling anti-transcendence. University of Wales, Aberystwyth NOTES 1.
