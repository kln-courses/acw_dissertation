Warren, Ml ABSTRACT The NHTSA's side impact dummy (SID) was evaluated against what is known of the side impact response of the human chest and responses were compared with data on Hybrid III frontal and EUROSID side impact characteristics. The SID dummy lacks a human-like chest deflection response which is crucial to the injury indica- ting capability of a dummy, it has a 9.8 kg near-side rib mass which is approximately an order of magnitude greater than that of the human, and it develops impact forces that are nearly three times higher than the recommended human chest response. It possesses character- istics primarily of an inertial device. The thoracic trauma index (TTI) was evaluated as an indicator of side impact injury risk, and design trends and optimized padding characteristics identified with the SID and TTI were compared with those from the Hybrid III dummy and viscous or compression injury criteria. TTI is an acceleration-based criterion which averages the maximum near-side rib and spinal acceleration irrespective of differences in times of occur- rence, it is determined in the first millisec- onds of impact, much earlier than human injuries can occur, and it is insensitive to the total kinetic energy of impact, so that TTI may indi- cate a safe exposure when an understanding of the full events of impact clearly indicate a significant injury risk. The SID dummy and TTI injury criterion were found unsuitable for side impact injury evaluation. THERE HAS BEEN A HIGH LEVEL OP INTEREST within the United States and overseas to establish a full-scale test for evaluating occupant protec- tion in side impact crashes. This interest has resulted in considerable research on the various elements of a side impact crash test. Two crit- ical requirements are an anthropomorphic test device or dummy with a human-like side impact response, and a biomechanical criterion which accurately predicts injury risk. A lack of either of these requirements may reduce the meaningfulness of the test, and more impor- tantly, may lead to design and engineering efforts which may not improve occupant protec- tion in side crashes. It is with these concerns that an evaluation was undertaken of the NHTSA's proposed side impact dummy (SID) and injury risk function thoracic trauma index (TTI) . Certain claims have been made over the past few years for the biofidelity of the SID dummy and efficacy of the TTI injury criterion. For the purpose of this investigation, biofidelity is defined as the degree to which an anthropo- morphic test device (dummy) or mathematical model accurately reproduces the essential char- acteristics of the human response to impact forces. Although Morgan et al (1) and Eppinger et al (2) claim biofidelity of the SID dummy, a review of knowledge on the human side impact response and recent evaluations in our labor- atory indicate that the SID dummy lacks the essential characteristics of the human side impact response. A source of the unsuitability can be traced to problems with the experimental approach of measuring only the acceleration response of cadavers in side impacts. This approach is not consistent with the method of determining chest-deflection response which was used by Nahum et al (3) and Kroell et al (4) in determining the frontal impact response of the human chest. This approach has led to the development and routine use of the Hybrid III dummy and has been proven valid in guiding improvements in vehicle interior designs. The acceleration response of the chest is not a sufficient characteristic of the human response because acceleration, when measured on a deformable body, is determined by two compon- ents, one causing whole-body motion and the other causing deformation of the body. Unless acceleration is related to a moving reference frame, which is difficult to do and was not done in the NHTSA research, it is not practical to differentiate the whole-body component from that which is causing deformation of the body. The pursuit of acceleration measurements alone to define the "global11 response of the 3.1403 0096-736X/88/9603-1 403S02.5Ö Copyright 1988 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">body is not consistent with the experience of a number of scientists who had emphasized the importance of body deformation in assessing injury risk from impact. It also does not rec- ognize the inappropriateness of measuring accel- eration on a highly deformable portion of the body. This latter conclusion can be traced to the experience of researchers who measured impact accelerations with a very high peak acceleration at contact thus bringing the impac- ted portion of the body to common velocity with the striker in the initial milliseconds of loading (see Figure 1) . To accurately measure this peak, the gain on the instrumentation has to be sufficiently low to capture the transient. However, this low gain setting makes it vir- tually impossible to accurately measure lower level accelerations which are important to the overall injury response and occur after the transient but during the deformation of the body motion. A second problem with acceleration measure- ment is that it relates to a point-wise assess- ment of response in one direction. When mea- sured on a near-side impacted rib, which may be fractured during impact, the orientation and significance of the point-wise response poten- tially involving experimental difficulties with the accelerometer mounting and response, must be questioned. Adding to this difficulty is a sensitivity of linear accelerometers to off-axis acceleration which introduces error into the signal depending on the change in orientation of the sensitive axis and the level of off-axis acceleration. These are several of the reasons why the multi-array accelerometer approach to measuring the response of the chest to side impact may not have been successful in producing a human-like response of the SID dummy. It is the purpose of this paper to evaluate the biofide lity of the SID dummy by a comparison Ml VI M2 M3 K12 K23 K23S 023S KV23 C23C C23T CV23 0 [VIANOjH.DAT 23.400 6.700 0.450 27.200 281.000 26.300 52.600 0.038 13.200 0.525 1.230 0.180 0.240 19-AUG-1987 07:58:54 Blunt Impact Response Fore«: 4.35 vc 0.970 at 9.0 Forc# 4.35 at 17.0 Comp: 34.82 5.71 at 5.0 ..ML... 8.36 at 23.0 Force vs. Compression VC &amp; V Force 6c Deflection •i r 7,5 5"i r10 I - / f / / ? ¿ 0'5 il ;/ ' ' ' * 2.5 ?

Chest dynamics include a rapid, high-level sternal acceleration transient which increases the velocity of chest deformation (V); however, the double integral of the difference between sternal and spinal acceleration produces chest deflection and the low-level sternal acceler- ations that follow the transient are important to the response.

A second aspect of the paper is to evaluate the sensitivity of the TTI injury criterion and determine whether it accurately reflects the physical processes of skeletal and soft-tissue injury of the human chest exposed to side impact. In this context, an injury criterion is defined as a biomechanical index which relates ā measurable mechanical response to the risk of Injury for a given intensity of impact. The criterion should not only accurately relate to the severity of injury but also point specif!^ cãlly to the moment of greatest injury risk. One important requirement of an injury criterion is that it have a scientific basis in the physi- cal events of the impact response and be founded in the principles of engineering mechanics (10,11). EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION OF DUMMY CHEST COMPLI- ANCES The SID dummy was subjected to blunt lat- eral impact in our laboratory to assess chest compliance. The impact condition was based on the standard certification test for the frontal impact response of the Hybrid III dummy, which involves a 23.4 kg mass contacting the chest at 6.7 m/s. To better characterize the side impact response of the SID dummy, test velocities were selected that bounded this certification speed. Figure 2 shows the force developed in the test as a function of the deflection between the rib and spinal mass of the SID dummy. The SID dummy quickly develops very high forces with virtually no deflection between the rib and spinal mass. 12 1 10- / ^ ' SID (7.5) I ' ^~' SID (6.3) _ 8- U V^'' EUROSID (6.8) - I I - 8 £ 6Tf"' I I ' V _ £ v V £ s J v S V A j i j o r 1 ~t 1 1 0 2 4 6 8 DEFLECTION (cm) Figure 2: Force-deflection response of the SID dummy exposed to blunt impact with a 23.4 kg mass at speeds above and below the certifi- cation test for chest compliance of the Hybrid III dummy. Also shown is the response of the EUROSID dummy provided by VRTC (from (13)). 872208 An evaluation of the time history of the higher speed impact response (Figure 3) reveals that the acceleration of the near-side rib mass rises rapidly with the applied force. Since the large rib mass dominates the impact response, the effective mass of the SID dummy near-side rib can be calculated by dividing the applied force by the near-side rib acceleration during the initial phase of impact. Completing this calculation for a number of tests, indicates a rib mass in the range of 8-10 kg, which is close to the NHTSA's published value for modelling purposes of 9.8 kg (12). This implies that the resistance from the SID dummy is not coming from spring or dashpot elements representing the biomechanical response of the chest, but rather from the inertia of the near-side mass. In this regard, the SID chest should be considered an inertia device not one which relies upon a com- pliant human-like response in its representation of the chest. The side thorax deflection even- tually reaches maximum value at about 50 ms after the significant phase of the impact loading . The most likely reason that the SID dummy design has such a high rib mass is that the side-wall impacts of the cadaver on which the SID design was based loaded skeletal structures Thorax Side Displacement to.o-i p 0.0 -10.0 X I -20.0 -30.0 ^ -40.0 -50.0 -I ~~ Top Near Side LATERAL ACC 80.0 -| 40.0 A - H 0.0 t: f-- - - ^ ^ O -40.0 Ť j -80.0 r~i -120.0 P? -160.0 -J L- 1 - PEND APPLIED FORCE 12.0 -ļ 8.0 r ' 4.0 - L- z / * / 0.0- - - -4.0 -8.0-1 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Time - Milliseconds Figure 3: SID dummy response for a blunt 7.5 m/s side impact with a 23.4 kg mass.

Human anatomy indi- cates that lateral chest impact would simultan- eously load the scapula and rib cage, since the scapula is tightly coupled to the spine and this loading would provide considerable inertial resistance in concert with the nearside arm and shoulder. In addition, the line of action of the force could be considerably offset from the center of gravity of the chest so that the sub- ject would experience whole-body rotation while the chest deflected. Both of these factors could lead to the unusual SID dummy chest design. The impact response of the EUROSID chest is shown in Figure 4 for the same pendulum impact exposure bracketed by the SID dummy tests. The EUROSID dummy has a much lower pla- teau force of 5-6 kN and develops a maximum deflection of approximately 4.5 cm (13). Infor- mation supplied by TNO about the EUROSID dummy to NHTSA (14) indicates an effective near-side rib mass for the EUROSID dummy chest of approx- imately 0.9 kg. This value is an order of mag- nitude lower than that of the SID dummy and is in reasonable agreement with the value of 0.45 kg for the sternal mass of the human chest and that of the Hybrid III dummy (15) . A recent evaluation of requirements for an advanced anthropomorphic test device (AATD) was conducted by the University of Michigan under the sponsorship of NHTSA (16) . Included in that analysis was a review of the available liter- ature on chest compliance for frontal and side impact loadings. The projected force-deflection response for lateral impact of the chest are shown in Figure 4 superimposed on the response data for the SID and EUROSID dummy. Based on the AATD analysis, the plateau force developed for the standard calibration impact should be 3.5 kN (see Figure 17 in (16) for the projected 12 1 sipJŁ§L„ I A r' ' - * - _ 10- / A r' ' - * - _ I I ' ' EUR0SIDJ[6.8) I ^ »K« ^ 8- j I ^ '' AATD CORR ^ % II ' lower Ld 6- H ' ' £ I s v t 4i t ' &gt; ■ ' r 2~ ' ' o-h - 1 ^ 1 1 0 2 4 6 8 DEFLECTION (cm) Figure 4: Force-deflection response as shown in Figure 2 with the projected corridor response of the human to side impact loading (redrawn from (16)). The higher corridor response represents the loading phase ^ of impact and the low-force corridor the projec- ^ ted unloading response of the side thorax. threshold force for other impact velocities) . The SID dummy clearly develops much higher for- ces than those recommended from an evaluation of available cadaver data. While the EUROSID dummy is a much better match to the response corridor, it also produces higher impact forces than sug- gested from the AATD analysis. In addition, experiments are ongoing to determine the compli- ance of the human chest for lateral impact. Results thus far indicate that the initial stiffness and plateau level recommended in the AATD analysis are too high (see appendix) . This data indicates that a lower force plateau and more compliance may be needed to accurately characterize the lateral impact response of the human chest. The greater chest compliance is an important factor in realistic occupant kine- matics, especially for an appropriate trajectory of the head, in side impact tests. Figure 5 shows a superposition of the SID dummy's impact response with those from test devices used in frontal impact. This data gives additional evidence for the unusual force- deflection characteristic of the SID dummy. The Hybrid III dummy has the lowest plateau force and the greatest compliance, and is considered the most human-like representation of the fron- tal human impact response (5,17). Interes- tingly, the plateau force developed for frontal loading of the Hybrid III dummy is the closest match to the corridor projected in the AATD analysis for side impact of the human chest. Even though the Hybrid III frontal chest re- sponse may be the best approximation of the human side impact response, the Hybrid III is not considered an appropriate device for side impact testing. However, Hybrid III responses will be used in this analysis to help evaluate the available side impact dummies and injury criteria.

One of the principal reasons to shift to the more compliant Hybrid III dummy was for improved safety designs for car occupants. A more human- like chest compliance should lead to interior designs of automobiles that are better matched to the human characteristics in a crash and thus improve impact protection. The Part 572 dummy is overly stiff as is the SAE J944 body block which has a similar deficiency in impact compli- ance. The body block is primarily a semi-rigid torso form backed by plywood. Both the body block and Part 572 dummy were designed before basic knowledge was developed on human compli- ance in frontal impact and today they are con- sidered inappropriate for chest injury assess- ment. The SID dummy produces higher forces than the SAE J944 body block and Part 572 dummy. The excessive stiffness and force developed by the SID dummy demonstrate that it is lacking in chest biofidelity and the high near-side rib mass produces unrealistically high impact for- ces. Such high levels of impact force produced by the SID dummy will lead to interfaces which are excessively stiff for occupant protection. Table 1 summarizes the recommended thres- hold value in the AATD analysis and the plateau force developed by the side and frontal impact dummies. The frontal impact force threshold for the Hybrid III dummy is the closest match to the recommended human compliance for side impact, while the SID dummy has the least correlation. In part, the unacceptable performance of the SID dummy can be traced to the near-side rib mass of 9.8 kg. An estimate of the rib volume, equiva- lent to 9.8 kg, is 400 cu in., that is a volume 8" X 10" and 5 inches thick, a poor representa- tion of the human near-side rib cage. MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF THE SID AND EUROSID The lumped-mass model developed by Lobdell (see (15)) was used to simulate the frontal impact response of the human chest by mass, spring and dashpot elements; it provided gui- dance for the development of a mechanical analog which culminated in the Hybrid III chest (5) . A modification of the original model was recently made by Yiano (20,21) so that the benefits of padding could be assessed for side impact pro- tection. Parameters in the original mathemat- ical model were varied in this analysis to approximate the side impact response of the SID and EUROSID dummy. Table 2 shows the mechanical components for the side impact models and gives the representative values for both the base-line Hybrid III dummy frontal impact response and model parameters for the EUROSID and SID dum- mies. Mass, spring and dashpot characteristics tor the SID dummy were obtained from the NHTSA side impact model by Trella and Kanianthra (12) . Some of the parameters were adjusted to provide a better fit for the force-deflection response of the model to the laboratory data on the SID response (Figure 6a).

Compliance data from VRTC tests with the EUROSID dummy (13) and data included in the recent TNO submission to NHTSA (14) were used to develop the model for the EUROSID dummy (Figure 6b) . With the capa- bility of adjusting the impact characteristics and studying the relative effect of different padding characteristics with different dummies, the models were considered important to a fur- ther understanding of the biomechanics of side impact. The first use of the models was to evaluate dummy responses in side impacts where data was available on human cadaver responses (8,9). COMPARISON OF DUMMY RESPONSES WITH CADAVER DATA Stalnaker, Roberts, and McElhaney (8) studied the side impact tolerance of the human cadaver to blunt impact. They conducted five cadaver tests with an impact mass of 10 kg directed laterally at the thorax at a speed of 6.1 or 8.8 m/s. The cadaver response data for the high-speed impacts is redrawn in Figure 7a for two of the specimens. In these tests, a plateau force of 3-4 kN was sustained for deflections of 6-8 cm. The impact conditions for the high-speed tests were simulated using the lumped-mass model of the SID, EUROSID and Hybrid III dummy. Figure 7b shows the force- deflection response of the three dummies for the cadaver impact exposure. Visual comparison verifies that the SID dummy produces approxi- mately three times the impact force at substan- 3.1407</page><page sequence="6">tially lower deflection lereis than the biomech- anic&amp;l response of the cadarer subjects. While the EUROSID dummy response is a closer approxi- mation to the cadaver data, its plateau force is higher and deflection lower than that observed in the cadaver subjects. The closest match to the cadaver impact response data is obtained with the frontal impact response of the Hybrid III dummy, which correctly approximates the threshold force and more closely approximates the deflection behavior of the cadavers.

The EUROSID is a closer approximation, but the closest simulation of the cadaver's side impact iesponse is again given by the frontal impact response of the Hybrid III dummy. Other biomechanical response data on cada- ver side impact was published by Stalnaker, Tarriere, et al (9). These cadaver tests involved a free fall from a height of 1 m and interaction of the chest with load measuring surfaces. Recently, Mertz (22) developed a pro- cedure for normalizing impact response data and applied it to the force-time response from the 1 m cadaver drops.

The EUROSID dummy closely approximates the force-time response, since it is the data set from which the EUROSID dummy chest was designed. Additional cadaver tests were conducted with a 2 m drop height and interaction of the chest (shoulder and scapula) with an energy- absorbing interface. While the deflection char- acteristics of the padding are not known, the maximum average dynamic crush was 6.5 cm. These tests were modeled using the crushable interface simulation of chest impact responses (20) by adjusting the cfush stiffness of the padding to achieve the observed residual deformation of the padding. Table 3 presents the lateral chest impact response from 20 cadavers reported by Stalnaker et al (8,9) for four different test conditions. The data are presented with a des- cription of the general severity of injury. Also shown is the predicted response from the mathematical model of the Hybrid III dummy fron- tal response, the EUROSID side chest and SID side chest impact response for the four test conditions . A rate-dependent compression criterion is needed to assess injury risk of frontal and side impacts where the velocities of body deformation exceed 3 m/s (11,23); and the importance of such a criterion, the viscous injury criterion, was presented in the public hearings held by NHTSA on side impact (24) . The use of the viscous injury response is recommended for the Hybrid III dummy frontal response or EUROSID side impact response, since the body's tolerance to deflection decreases with an increasing speed of deformation. 9-1 f' i V - - ^6- j /' ^ ^ EUROSID l±J I /7^ V' ' £ l±J //7 ,A V' ' '' ' e 3- 'f/ //7 / ' ' '' 0-r - i 1 1 1 1 1 0 10 20 30 40 50 TIME (ms) Figure 9: Normalized corridor response of the human cadaver for aim free fall unto a load-measuring surface (redrawn from (22)).

In one series of tests, a 70 mm thickness of 3.5 kN crush force hexcell was attached to the face of a 23.4 kg rigid impactor. A summary of the rigid and padded impact responses from the pen- dulum impact tests with the SID dummy is given in Table 4. The thoracic trauma index (TTI) kernel was calculated according to the most recent method discussed by Morgan et al (1) . The purpose of these tests was to increase the severity of the impact by increasing the veloc- ity of impact (and kinetic energy) until the benefits of the energy-absorbing interface were overwhelmed by increasing the severity of impact energy (see (20,21)). This effect should be reflected as an increased probability of injury risk by the TTI criterion. To evaluate the sensitivity of the SID dummy and TTI injury criterion and to provide a perspective for com- parison, the frontal Hybrid III dummy response and viscous injury criterion were used in a similar set of impacts. The results of the complimentary Hybrid III dummy tests are shown in Table 5. The 8.4 m/s padded impact response of the SID dummy will be used to exemplify deficiencies and the unsuitability of the SID dummy for assessing injury risks in side impacts. Figure 10 shows the impact force applied to the side thorax of the SID dummy, and the upper near-side rib acceleration and spinal acceleration of the dummy. The early plateau in force at 3 kN reflects the load-limiting effect of the crush- able hexcell interface. This controls the first peak in the near-side rib acceleration to approximately 60 g and that of the spinal accel- eration to just over 30 g. The two peaks in acceleration are separated by only a few milli- seconds in time. In this test, the maximum injury risk is 'predicted by the first peak in accelerations, during the first few milliseconds of impact and during crush of the energy-absor- bing interface. However, there is sufficient kinetic energy in this impact that after crush of the inter- face, the force on the thorax rises to approx- imately 0.4 kN. Even with this three-fold increase in applied force, the near-side accel- eration at the time of peak load is below 50 g 's probably because the rib and spinal masses are coupled so that the effective mass of the near- side rib is closer to 23 kg (the load of 9.4 kN divided by approximately 40 g of near-side rib acceleration indicates a 23 kg mass which is almost identical to the total thoracic weight of the SID dummy, see Table 2). In this case, even though the force dramatically increases after crush of the interface, the TTI level is lower than that which was predicted during the first milliseconds of impact. If the speed of impact (and kinetic energy) were increased above the 8.4 m/s impact veloc- Table 5 PENDULUM IMPACTS OF THE HYBRID III DUMMY Energy Acceleration Velocity Crush Initial Abs. Eff.

However, the SID dummy and TTI injury criteria were insensitive to the increased kinetic energy. More importantly, these experiments demonstrate that an approach exists that may cause the SID/TTI to indicate a safe impact exposure when it doesn't exist, if the first milliseconds of impact are controlled by a crushable interface. The interface can cause the near-side rib and spinal masses to be coupled together so that the dummy can exper- ience much higher impact forces without indica- ting a higher TTI value and thus an increased implied injury risk. Table 6 demonstrates the insensitivity of the TTI and SID dummy to the total energy of impact and shows how it can indicate a safe impact when there is serious' risk of internal organ injury. Comparable data were obtained from Tables 4 and 5 by linear interpolation of responses. There are two different sets of tests for comparison. The first is a rigid impact at 5 m/s and a padded impact at 8.4 m/s. When the energy absorbed by the interface is subtracted from the initial impact energy, the higher speed impact has approximately twice the kinetic energy to be managed by the occupant. Exposing the Hybrid III dummy to these frontal impacts indicates a significantly higher injury risk for the padded high-speed impact by a higher viscous and compression response. Gn the basis of human injury as a function of viscous response, the high-speed padded impact with VC = 1.37 m/s has a 96% probability of critical injury in contrast to a probability of &lt;1% with a VC = 0.55 m/s in the rigid impact (11). In contrast, the SID dummy and TTI predicts similar injury risk. Since TTI was determined within the first milliseconds of impact and was con- trolled by the very early crush of the inter- face, the SID dummy and TTI are shown to be insensitive to the total energy of the higher speed exposure . In a similar fashion, a 6.3 m/s rigid impact and 10.3 m/s padded impact demonstrate a similar injury risk on the basis of TTI even though there was over a two-fold increase in the effective kinetic energy of the higher speed impact. Again, the Hybrid III dummy frontal response and viscous injury criterion (or chest deflection) indicate the increased injury risk with the higher speed padded run. These data indicate that the SID dummy and TTI would be ineffective in evaluating side impact padding and may lead to a false conclusion of safety benefit in high-speed loadings by the introduc- tion of a few centimeters of padding to control the early response of the rib mass. The princi- pal deficiency with the SID dummy is its heavy rib mass and its inappropriate chest compliance which make it unsuitable for the evaluation of side impact injury countermeasures, since human- like compliance of the test device is a princi- pal requirement for the evaluation of safety systems (see Horsch and Viano' s discussion (19) of the influence of a test device on the per- PENDUUUM Appltod Foro« 10.0 r- 8.0 ' 6.0 ■ t c 4.0 -~t'- Jř 4.0 „ - r 0 25 50 75 100 50.0 , , , 1 UPPER NEAR SIDE ACCELEROMETER ;ļļ± - If - -so.o I -75.0 ' ' O 25 50 75 100 400 r 1 1 i SPINAL ACCOJEROMCTER 10 0 i - A 20.0 1 O 10.0 -20.0 » ' 0 25 50 7» 100 Tim« (ra) Figure 10: Padded impact of the SID dummy demonstrating the impact force and acceler- ation responses of the SID dummy. 3.1413</page><page sequence="12">Table 8 PENDULUM IMPACTS OF SID AND HYBRID III DUMMY Velocity Bff.

MATHEMATICAL PREDICTIONS OF PADDING EFFECTIVE- NESS The experimental results from the rigid and padded impacts of the SID and Hybrid III dummies were used to validate the mathematical models of the chest when padding is used as an interface. The Hybrid III dummy was used because it best approximates the lateral force-deflection response of the human chest. Experimental results and analytical simulations for the rigid and padded impact response of the SID dummy are shown in Figure 11 and for the Hybrid III fron- tal impact response with and without padding in Figure 12. The results of the mathematical models closely approximate the data obtained from experimental testing with the dummies. In this comparison, the TTI kernel is used for comparison of the SID dummy response and the viscous injury criterion is used for the Hybrid III frontal impact. Figure 13 summarizes the reduction in TTI and viscous response for a 23.4 kg impactor interfaced with a 3.5 kN constant crush force interface of 5 cm thickness. There are some striking differences between the two dummies and injury criteria as a function of the velocity of impact. With the Hybrid III dummy, the impact force does not reach the crush force of the interface until the impact speed approaches 6 m/s. At that severity, crush of the interface provides a reduction in viscous response (and injury risk). In contrast, the heavy inertia of the SID chest produces higher impact forces at lower speeds and thus crushes the interface for impacts as low as 2 m/s. The SID dummy also indicates a maximum reduction in TTI for an impact of approximately 6 m/s severity, which is just at the threshold where the crushable inter- face indicates any protection with the Hybrid III dummy. For impacts above 12 m/s, the Hybrid III dummy and viscous response indicate that the severity of impact is so great that the crush- ixble interface is overwhelmed by high kinetic energy and thus there is virtually no reduction in injury risk (see (20,21) for additional dis- cussion). In contrast, the SID dummy and TTI show a substantial reduction in injury risk for impacts up to 20 m/s. This is primarily the result of a premature determination of the maxi- mum TTI and the fact that early control of force by a crushable interface will reduce TTI irres- pective of the total kinetic energy of impact. This effect can have a profound influence on the perceived benefit of padding in high-speed crashes . If the impact speed of the side door into the occupant were in the range of 14-16 m/s, the SID and TTI would predict a 10-15 percent reduc- tion in injury risk while a comparable evalu- ation using the frontal impact response of the Hybrid III dummy would indicate that the addi- tion of 5 cm of padding would have no effect on reducing real-world injury risks. This would be due to the extreme severity of the exposure which would overwhelm the energy management capability of the crushable interface. Here we have a contradiction in conclusions. One that may lead to the introduction of padding that has a perceived benefit, but that may not influence the protection of real-world occupants. An additional set of simulations were carried out to further explore this situation. In the next simulations, a constant speed of the side door loading was modelled for a range of constant crush force interfaces. The purpose of this simulation was to explore the process of optimization of the side interior characteristic and the effect that the SID dummy might have on the perceived solution. By using the SID and TTI, the designer would see lower accelerations as the interface becomes stiff er. For a side impact of 10 m/s, the maximum reduc- tion in TTI would be obtained with a crushable 3.1414</page><page sequence="13">872208 interface force of approximately 6.2 kN. How- ever, the identical exposure to the Hybrid III dummy would indicate that the optimum solution obtained with the SID dummy is so stiff that it won't crush under the Hybrid III chest impact. Optimizing the most effective interface crush force for frontal chest protection is much sof- ter and is approximately 4 kN. By an improper choice of dummy and injury criterion we can have a solution which has a perceived benefit by reducing TTI. However, this padding has virtually no effect on reducing the injury risk for real occupants as reflected in the essentially rigid response of the Hybrid III dummy and viscous injury response.

The effect of varying the crushable interface for different speeds of loadings (8 m/s and 6 m/s) are also shown in Figure 14. Again, the SID dummy and TTI injury criterion lead to a stiffer crush force than would be predicted to provide maximum benefit to real occupants . Because of the excessive rib mass of the SID dummy and the unrealistically high impact forces developed by the device, the most effec- tive interface pad will be stiffer and have a higher crush force than would be needed to bene- fit real-world occupants.

This fact is even more apparent when the data in Figure 14 are normalized by the tolerance of VC =1.0 m/s or TTI = 150 (the latter is done for a 40 year old subject). Figure 15 shows the nor- malized injury risks and indicates that the SID and TTI can be below threshold for any choice of crush constant above 3.5 kN, whereas virtually no interface is effective in providing protec- tion based on the Hybrid III dummy and viscous injury criterion at the highest impact speed. The contrast is striking. The TTI injury criterion is not a sensitive indicator of injury risk. This analysis and the recent criticism by Brun-Cassan (25) clearly indicate that the TTI injury criterion is inappropriate for side impact injury evaluation. In reaching their conclusions, the authors state "the conclusion reached was that thorax-abdomen protection cannot be assessed on the basis of this (TTI) criterion; it does not enable to predict the level of injury resulting from the side impact, nor to correctly classify the results of tests carried out independently." In view of the previous information on the high forces developed by the SID dummy and the premature and insensitive determination of injury risk by the acceleration based TTI, side impact padding developed for the lowest level of TTI will result in side interiors of higher stiffness than is appropriate for protection of real-world occupants. Such overly stiff side interiors might particularly place the elderly and children at risk because of their lower tolerance. The use of the SID and TTI could deprive real occupants of the potential protec- tive benefit they may experience by less rigid side interiors (20,21) which would result from the use of a more human-like surrogate with biofidelity in the chest deflection response and an injury index such as the viscous response 80 n 3.5 kN 5 cm g70" ft 60 - /' I - / ' Ui / &gt; * 40- ; » - I ' IILLS1Q1.

SUMMARY 1. The SĪD dummy lacks a human-like chest deflection response, which is crucial to the injury indicating capability of an anthropo- morphic test device. The SID dummy has a 9.8 kg near-side rib mass which is approximately an order of magnitude greater than the effec- tive human near-side rib mass. The high mass may have been designed into the SID after measuring rib acceleration in side impact tests in which a significant portion of the response must have been associated with scap- ula, arm and shoulder loading. The SID dummy produces impact forces that are nearly three times higher than the recommended human chest response and lacks biofidelity in chest com- pliance. 2. The SID dummy was developed with reli- ance on acceleration responses from human cadavers in sled and pendulum side impact exposures. This approach does not adequately account for the two components of acceler- ation, one representing the whole-body response and the other the deformat ional response of the body. The SID dummy does not discriminate between the two acceleration components. The principal measure of biofi- delity of a test device is the human-like force deflection response. This implies that the evaluation of deflection of the body is the principal measure of response and injury risk. The measurement of acceleration alone cannot differentiate the component related to whole-body motion and that related to deforma- tion of the compliant body. Thus, the exces- sive near-side rib mass, unrealistically high forces, and lack of human-like compliance with the SID dummy make it unsuitable for side impact injury evaluation. 872208 3. Twenty human cadaver side impact tests involving four different test conditions were identified in the literature. A mathematical model of the SID dummy response was compared with data from the cadavers and in all cases there was a mismatch between the SID dummy and the cadaver response. The side impact response of the EUROSID dummy provided a clo- ser approximation of the cadaver response. Interestingly, the frontal impact response of the Hybrid III dummy provides the closest match of all the available anthropomorphic test devices to the human side impact response of the chest. 4. The thoracic trauma index (TTI) is an acceleration-based criterion which uses the maximum value of the near-side rib and spinal acceleration, irrespective of differences in time of occurrence, to determine an average acceleration response of the dummy. Because of the excessively high near-side rib mass and the type of rib coupling to the dummy spine, the TTI is determined within the first few milliseconds of impact. Based on knowledge of chest injury mechanisms, the TTI prediction occurs much earlier than actual human injuries can occur. Because TTI is determined so early, force limiting during the initial phase of impact can significantly reduce the TTI value. The early prediction of injury risk was used to demonstrate that the dummy and injury criterion are insensitive to the total kinetic energy of impact. A number of exam- ples are shown which SID and TTI indicate are relatively safe exposures, whereas an under- standing of the full events of impact indi- cates a significant injury risk. 5. Because of the high forces developed by the SID dummy and the premature prediction of injury based TTI, use of the SID dummy and TTI injury criterion would result in overly stiff side interiors. This could particularly place the elderly and children, who have lower tolerances to impact, at risk with stiff side interiors and might deprive real occupants of the potential protection they may experience from softer side interiors. More reasonable predictions of occupant protection can be obtained by use of the Hybrid III dummy fron- tal response or EUROSID side impact response and a deflection-based injury criterion such as the viscous response. However, more recent data on the side impact response of the human chest indicates that a lower plateau force and more compliance may be needed in the EUROSID for a human-like response.
