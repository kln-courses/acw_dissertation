Booth, Suzanne Higgs, Jennifer Schneider, and Isabelle Klinkenberg University of Birmingham Abstract In this study, we separated for the first time the learned liking for a particular level of sweetness in a familiar drink from the infantile delight in sweetness as such ("the sweeter, the better"). It is widely assumed that sensing a liked food or drink evokes a pleasurable experience, but the only psychological evidence for this assumption has been tongue movements that are elicited specifically by sweet taste in animals and human neonates.We found that adults felt such movements in response to drinking juice at both their personally preferred level of sweetness and levels they deemed so sweet as to be undrinkable.Yet only the intolerably strong level of sweetness elicited enjoyment of the experienced movements, elevation of mood, and a sense of smiling. Hence, the pleasure that adults experience during ingestion could be exclusively linked with the congenital sweetness reflex that sends mother's milk down an infant's throat.

In contrast, classi- cal Greece had a word for pleasure, hedone, that came from the sweet taste of honey, hedus. Newborn human infants have a brainstem orofacial reflex specific to the taste of sugar (Rosenstein &amp; Oster, 1988). When this reflex is activated, the infant rolls the tongue into a tube, facilitating the transfer of fluid to the back of the mouth and down the throat. Such move- ments of the tongue in response to sweetness appear to be the only innate appetitive reaction in the human species. A similar fixed action pattern is seen in other mammals that can taste sweet sugars (Steiner, Glaser, Hawilo, &amp; Berridge, 2001). In rats, the subcortical forebrain structure that plays a key role in the motivation of all ingestion includes a region involved in sweetness-elicited movements (Pecina &amp; Berridge, 2005). These muscular patterns have been assumed to express feelings of pleasure in neonates (Steiner, 1977) as well as in rats (Berridge &amp; Grill, 1983). Indeed, the name of this pattern in rats was changed from ingestive to hedonic (Berridge, Venier, &amp; Robinson, 1989), instead of to appetitive, to indicate the opposite of the aversive fixed action pattern (Craig, 1918/ 1996). Such assignments of emotion-related terms risk the pathetic fallacy (the unwarranted attribution of human feelings to animals), a form of introspectionist anthropomorphism (Crist, 1999). Objectively justifying a claim that pleasure is experienced is a challenge to experimental design in psycho- logical science. Can conditions be set up in which the taste of sugar elicits pleasure unconfounded by sugar's activation of ingestive movements? In terms of the mental processes involved in these reactions, affectively toned sensations need to be distinguished from the motivation to consume sweet materials (Booth, 1991). Our study exploited the fact that decisions to eat or drink are motivated by particular levels of sensed and conceptual- ized attributes of a food or beverage, including its sweetness (Booth &amp; Freeman, 1993; Conner, Haddon, Pickering, &amp; Booth, 1988). The expected intensity of sweetness is no differ- ent from any feature of a food or drink that helps people decide whether to take another mouthful. Each individual has learned to consume the material when the feature is at a specific level; this is true for sweetness, even in rats (Booth, Lovett, &amp; McSherry, 1972). Hence, as is implicit in early work by Shepard (1957), the motivating effect of the feature declines Corresponding Author: David A.

The sweetness of a fruit juice, for example, could be made so low or so high that the individual would never choose to drink it. Two hypotheses were tested in the present experiment. We first examined whether an underlying tendency to move the tongue in response to the taste of sugar can override the acquired motivation to reject a drink that is excessively sweet. Second, we tested whether strong sweetness can elicit signs of positive affect that the learned liking for moderate sweetness does not evoke. Method Participants Thirty-one volunteers (male and female) over 1 5 years of age participated in the study. All were familiar with and liked unfiltered, fresh apple juice (of a brand widely available in the United Kingdom) and consented to assess mouthful samples of the juice containing varying levels of common food con- stituents, including artificial sweeteners. 1657 Participants were included only if they had not drunk any fluid in the previous hour. No level of sweetness can be totally acceptable when other influences on the intention to drink are not at the individual's acquired norms for those features (a contextual defect). In that case, the peaked function (see Fig. 1) is not a triangle but a vertical section through the side of the cone (i.e., a hyperbola; Booth &amp; Freeman, 1993). Hence, the closer that other aspects of the test are to the personal norm, the sharper is the peak of the observed psychophysical function of preference on sweetener, and the straighter the line through data on either limb. Such precision is approached if participants are normally thirsty and assess a moderate num- ber of mouthfuls of the drink used in the study (Conner, Haddon, &amp; Booth, 1986). Materials All the samples tested during each session were prepared from a single batch of apple juice made by mixing the contents of several newly purchased bottles. Juice from which sugars and acids had been removed by dialysis was used to determine the concentrations of saccharin and malic acid that should be Always Choose i ai Contextua| | I Defect L ! | 5 : L "Breakthrough" of the Reflex c/&gt; L i ' ' R -S 0 i .§■ § 8 1 : R S 8 !

Schematic plots illustrating how motivation can be dissociated from pleasure. The two plots are on a single x-axis of levels of sweetener. Two distinct types of response (on the y-axes) are evoked by a mouthful of a familiar drink with varied levels of sweetener (see Booth, 1 99 1 , 1 994; Booth &amp; Shepherd, 1 988; Conner, Haddon, &amp; Booth, 1 986; Conner, Haddon, Pickering, &amp; Booth, 1 988). One response is learned liking, the intentional disposition to drink a whole glassful of the sample (from always choose to never choose and beyond to rejection). In this illustration, the "L" data points indicate an example of an individual's degrees of liking at four levels of sweetness. For the likings to form an isosceles triangle (one slope value), the x-axis is scaled in equal ratios (equal differences in logarithms) of concentration of a single sweet compound. The second response is an indicator of the inborn reflex: the number of times the concept of a movement of the tongue or face is written in reaction to the sweet taste of a mouthful. In this illustration, the "R" data points indicate the example individual's inborn reflex at four levels of sweetness, including two far too sweet for a glassful.</page><page sequence="3">1658 added to match the sweetness and sourness of the purchased juice. Participants were tested using samples of the purchased juice mixed one-to-one by volume with resweetened and reacidulated dialysate. Sweetness was varied using an intense sweetener because sugars become viscous and abrasively hypertonic as their concentrations increase. We chose saccha- rin as the sweetener to vary in level because it has regulatory approval in Europe and its taste does not linger. Fructose and glucose in apples can mask the bitterness of high concentra- tions of saccharin for some individuals. Sweetener levels rejected by the individual In the first phase of the experiment, the ingestion-motivating effects of different levels of sweetness were measured by hav- ing participants rate three or four mouthful samples of the juice for degree of acceptance as a full drink. Zero acceptance meant that the participant lacked motivation to drink more mouthfuls of the juice.1 Samples of juice varying in concentra- tion of sweetener were rated in answer to the question, "How much would you like to drink a whole glass of juice tasting like this?" The rating scale consisted of a row of 10 boxes labeled always choose at one end and never choose at the other (Fig. 1, left-hand jy-axis). Four additional boxes were provided below the 10 boxes so participants could rate the juice in a range indicating that the juice was "even worse to have as a full drink." The concentration of sweetener that was just too high to drink (at never choose) was determined for each par- ticipant by extrapolating the data from three or four samples above the sweetener level that we estimated was ideal (at always choose). Biases on quantitative judgment (Poulton, 1988) were min- imized between sweetener levels that yielded drinks insuffi- ciently sweet and too sweet to choose (Conner et al., 1988), as follows. The first sample that participants assessed was slightly above marketed sweetness. If this sample was rated as too sweet, we increased the level of malic acid in the second sam- ple to ensure that it was not sweet enough for a full drink, but not so sour as to be totally undrinkable. If the first sample was rated as not sweet enough, a higher level of sweetener was presented in the second sample. A sample with extra malic acid was tested third. The fourth sample had a level of sweet- ener that improved the extrapolations of the data from the two sweeter samples to the levels corresponding to never choose and, in the other direction, always choose. In the second phase of the experiment, four samples were selected from a stock series in the following sequence - (a) the level of sweetener closest to the individual's never choose point, (b) the level closest above the always choose point, (c) a level of malic acid that approached the never choose point because of insufficient sweetness, and (d) a level of sweetener higher than the never choose point by the ratio of the never choose level to the always choose level for that participant. Participants were asked to rate their first reaction to the taste of each sample without thinking about it. First, participants Booth et o/. rated "the muscular reaction in the mouth" from 7, as nice as I could imagine, to 0, not at all nice. Then they rated the same reaction from 7, as nasty as I could imagine, to 0, not nasty at all. These separate unipolar layouts, unlike the commonly used bipolar format (Peryam &amp; Pilgrim, 1957), can distinguish an increase in appetitive response from a decrease in aversive- ness. Next, participants wrote their own wordings for the mus- cular reaction that they had just rated. Finally, for each sample, participants rated "how much better and/or worse tasting that sample made you feel" from 7, as good as imaginable, to 0, no improvement, and from 7, as bad as imaginable, to 0, no worsening. Impressions of movement while tasting Because a thrill of pleasure is a private experience, any physi- cal reactions taken as indicators of pleasurable sensation would need to be validated on verbal measures. Tongue rolling is not observable unless the lips are well parted or the tongue protrudes between them. Because noninvasive imaging and sufficiently small biosensors are not currently available, we conducted an objective analysis of participants' written con- ceptions of movement of the tongue. This analysis allowed us to determine whether the tasting of samples of juice close to the personally ideal level of sweetness, at a level that was just too high to be acceptable, and at a far higher level of sweetness elicited a specific set of concepts of movements. A minority of the participants (n = 9) wrote words that referred only to sensory qualities or that evaluated the sam- ples. These data were excluded from analysis. The remaining 22 participants conceptualized at least one movement of the mouth or face. Two movements were mentioned in response to only 6% of the samples of juice. Infants' rolling of the tongue in response to sweetness may be accompanied by licking of the lips (Rosenstein &amp; Oster, 1988). Adults' ingestive movements may be allied with affec- tive facial displays that influence other people's actions toward the materials being consumed (Addessi, Galloway, Visalberghi, &amp; Birch, 2005; Rousset, Schlich, Chatonnier, Barthomeuf, &amp; Droit- Volet, 2008). Hence, concepts of facial emotion could provide evidence of pleasure distinct from ingestion. In our study, participants' wordings for movements were categorized into four sets; three sets had 14 to 17 examples each, and one had 7 examples. Explicit references to rolling or curling the tongue (6 examples), protruding the tongue (1 example), or licking the lips (7 examples) were classified as expressions of imagined or actual lingual movements charac- teristic of the sweetness reflex. Characterizations of other sorts of movement inside the mouth were categorized as experi- ences of ingestive movements (acceptance); these 14 exam- ples included "move[d] tongue [around]" (5 examples), "lick my teeth/gums/roof/top of mouth" (3 examples), and "washed round mouth" (1 example). The phrases "didn't want to swal- low," "pursing lips," "move lips," "grimace," "screwing mouth," "small frown," "squint eyes," and "blinked eyes several times"</page><page sequence="4">Sensual Pleasure and Incentive Motivation were grouped as feelings of rejection (a total of 17 examples). The words "smile" (6 examples) and "laugh" (1 example) were counted as a sense of smiling. Results Motivation to drink Each participant rated a mouthful of the apple juice that had one of the lowest concentrations of additional sweetener as the most likely sample he or she would choose as a full drink (e.g., 6 mg of saccharin per 100 ml). The juice with the next highest concentration of sweetener was always rated as less accept- able (cf. Fig. 1). That enabled us to make a provisional back- extrapolation to the sweetener concentration for a personal "just right" sweetness, or ideal point at which that person would always choose that variant of the juice for a drink. The participants' rating of a third oversweet sample confirmed both that extrapolation and an extrapolation in the opposite direction to a concentration that would have lowered the rating to "I'd never choose it for a drink." This rating was the point of zero acceptance and the start of rejection for excessive sweetness. This concentration of sweetener was usually two or three times the personal ideal. These findings were as predicted from the triangular peak of an individual's learned acceptance of a particular level of sweetness for a familiar food or drink (Fig. 1; Conner et al., 1988). This theoretical linearity of the effect of oversweetness on a person's ingesti ve motivation allowed us to estimate, for each participant, a still higher concentration of sweetener that was far beyond the level of just tolerably excessive sweetness, motivating participants to reject such versions of the juice for use as a drink. Differential incidences of descriptions of movements Participants provided freely worded narratives about move- ments in the mouth and face in response to three levels of sweetener: the level they would always choose for a full drink, a level too sweet ever to choose for a drink, and a level so sweet that they would definitely reject the drink. Concepts of oral and facial movement could be classified in four ways: (a) movements that occur when ingesting any liked drink, (b) movements that occur when sampling a disliked drink, (c) movements that are specific to the taste of sucrose in human neonates, and (d) facial movements that indicate positive affect. The incidences of these different categories of movement concepts varied reliably across the three levels of sweetener, X2(ll, N = 22) = 243, p &lt; .02 (see Fig. 2). Concepts of accep- tance movement were almost always recorded for the sweet- ener level nearest to always choose, and participants almost never referred to rejection movements in their narratives for these samples. Conversely, experiences of movements reflecting rejection of the sample were almost exclusively 1659 elicited by the levels of sweetener that the individual would not tolerate. Rejection movements may have been felt more often at levels of sweetness that were just barely intolerable than at levels of more intense sweetness. This would be con- sistent with a decrement in generalization from the condi- tioned stimulus in a configuration with other features of the drink because that holistic response becomes less feasible when the sweetness is too powerful to contextualize (Booth, 1981, 1985). In contrast, both extremely sweet samples and ideally sweet samples elicited concepts of ingestive movements congeni- tally specific to the taste of sugar. These results can be inter- preted as reflecting acquired motivation at the ideal level and an innate reflex at the unfamiliarly strong level of sweetness. A reflex has a more vigorous response when the stimulus is more intense. Hence, the incidence of concepts of tongue curl- ing and lip licking at the never chosen level of sweetener could be attributed entirely to reflexive responding. Despite the instruction to describe movements in the mouth, participants sometimes wrote about facial reactions. Surprise in blinks of the eyes and distress in a frown or a squint were counted among movements of rejection. These reactions were most prevalent for oversweet juice. It is strik- ing, therefore, that the experience of smiling and, in one case, even laughing also occurred most often when participants tasted the samples that were too sweet to drink. Indeed, smil- ing was mentioned more often when sweetness was at its strongest than when it was just intolerable. This experience of smiling indicated positive affect, and it was almost entirely confined to concepts of the movements of the sweetness- evoked congenital reflex. Our analysis does not include "went mmmhhhh," which was written just once. "Mmmhhhh" is the same onomatopoeia as "yum" if the lips are pressed together during the voicing. The only other description (also not included in our analysis) that might have referred to such a movement came from another participant: "rubbing [lips] together." However, this phrase was coupled with "licking lips"; therefore, it could have been a reaction to wetting the lips rather than to the sweet taste. No written words referred to repeated smacking of the lips. Lip smacking may not be an unlearned muscular pattern, as lip licking can be. The key point is that "went mmmhhhh" was written in response to the sample of juice that had a sweetener level near the level rated never choose. Neither the level close to always choose nor the level far greater than never choose elicited a sense of any such movement. Yet each of those two other lev- els was described by some participants as "pleasurable," "tasty," or "nice" (British English for "yummy"). So why was the onomatopoeia at least as common for the intermediate level of sweetness? Apparently, the niceness of undrinkably strong sweetness is so different from the niceness of perfect sweet- ness that the two evaluations counter each other rather than summating into a stronger positive rating. This is consistent with the view that movements of learned liking are competing</page><page sequence="5">1 660 Booth et al. 3 100-, D I- 8°- •£ 60- , , U •£ i* I g 60- 9&gt;~ II 40' It I I §° 20. #| 2°- &lt; a: 0J 1 1 l=l o' 1 I I U 1 Always Never Reject Always Never Reject Choose Choose Choose Choose c d 60- I « E © ^ it40- n i- i Ü40' I S 20- i 1 =i g 20- «Q £S I 1 0J 1 U U 1 o-i 1 LJ U Always Never Reject Always Never Reject Choose Choose Choose Choose Sweetener Level (Personal Decision on Having as a Drink) Fig. 2. Distribution of participants' concepts of orofacial movement in response to three samples of juice. Relative frequencies are shown for words used to conceptualize (a) ingestive movements (e.g., "moved tongue [around]," "licked top of mouth"), (b) rejection movements (e.g., "pursed lips," "grimace," "squinted"), (c) sweet-taste movements (e.g., "licked lips," "curl/roll tongue"), and (d) smile movements ("smile," "makes me laugh"). The juice sample labeled as always choose had the stock level of saccharin closest to the extrapolated peak of the individual's learned liking (see Fig. I), that is, the most preferred sweetness for a full drink of the juice (usually 6.3 mg per 1 00 ml of juice). The sample labeled never choose had the saccharin level closest to the individual's excess rejection point (i.e., just too much sweetness ever to be chosen as a drink). In the sample labeled reject, the ratio of the concentration of saccharin to the concentration in the never choose sample was at least as high as the ratio of saccharin in the never choose sample to saccharin in the always choose sample for that individual (a concentration of 1 3-20 mg of saccharin per 1 00 ml). with an unlearned reflexive response to sweetness. The overall rarity of this pressing together of the lips among the felt move- ments is a further indication of such conflict. It also raises issues about the use of "yum" as a term for assessing prefer- ences for foods. Affective reactions The participants showed less positive affect in movement con- cepts and in mood in response to a level of sweetness that they would never choose than in response to a sweetness that they would always choose (Fig. 3). Yet an even greater sweetness, still further from the ideal sweetness, elicited greater positive affect in both felt movement and mood. Specifically, mood after tasting a sample of juice was reliably more positive for the rejected extreme of sweetness than for the never choose level of sweetness, two-tailed/? &lt; .015 (Fig. 3, lower panel). The product-moment correlation between the ratings at never choose sweetness and rejected sweetness was .76. How "nice" the movement felt also had a higher mean for the rejected extreme of sweetness than for the never choose level of sweetness but this difference did not approach reli- ability, two-tailed p &lt; .14, r = .56 (Fig. 3, upper panel). How- ever, when our analyses excluded participants whose learned likings were so strong that their affective ratings of move- ments in response to ideal sweetness were at ceiling (i.e., scores of 7 or 6), the directional hypothesis was supported sta- tistically (never choose: M =3.2; reject: M= 4.3), t(9) = 1.88, p&lt;.05. Discussion This experiment dissociated the learned preference for sweet- ness in a drink from the inborn reaction to sweetness itself.

See Figure 2 for an explanation of the always choose, never choose, and reject levels of saccharin. associatively conditioned sensory acceptance rises with stimu- lus intensity from indifference to a peak, declines to indiffer- ence again, and declines further to rejection if, for example, there is neophobia or conditioned aversion to the greatest intensities. In contrast, vigor of the response in a reflex increases monotonically with the intensity of the stimulus. Therefore, in theory, the reflexive response to sweetness might break through the lack of learned acceptance for excessive sweetness and overcome any tendency to reject a greater extreme of sweetness than the sweetness that the individual has learned to refuse because it is too far from ideal. Using a design based on these mechanistic considerations, we obtained the first unambiguous evidence in human adults that the pleasure from the taste of sweetness is distinct from the choice to consume a sweet food or a sweet drink. These findings could be the start of a body of evidence that the gusta- tory stimulus from sucrose, fructose, glucose, and maltose (and their artificial substitutes) is the only source of pleasur- able sensations from the head senses - and then only when the I66[ intensities of sweetness are much greater than can generally be tolerated in a particular food or drink. We found that when a familiar juice was sweetened to a level that was intolerably sweet, three forms of positive affect accompanied verbal expression of experience of movement of the mouth or face. First, the impressions of movement at unacceptably strong levels of sweetness were rated as more pleasurable ("nice") than the movement experiences at the ideal sweetness for drinking. This observation by itself could reflect either an affective connotation of the verbal concept used to describe a movement or affective qualities of the experience of a sensa- tion related to a movement (e.g., by sensory feedback from moving or by efference copy from the motor command). There is also a broader question whether this pleasure in felt move- ment is somatic, mental, or both (cf. the displeasures of fatigue in body and in mind: Bowman, Booth, Platts, &amp; UK Sjögren's Interest Group, 2004). A second type of positive affect was participants' general state of mind immediately after tasting each sample (i.e., when they rated their mood as "good"). Movement ratings and mood ratings were made using the same layout and syntax; there- fore, it can be asserted legitimately that the ratings of good mood were not as high as the ratings of nice movement. Fur- thermore, the zero rating in both sets of judgments was anchored on neutral affect; so the ratios between means for mood can be compared with the ratios between means for movements. For the just unacceptable level of sweetener, both mood and movement ratings were about 1 .4 times the corre- sponding ratings of the ideal level of sweetness. The further increase in good mood with rejected levels of sweetener, how- ever, was not as great in ratio as the increase in niceness of movements with rejected levels of sweetener. This relation between a pleasurable feeling and, on the one hand, elevation of mood and, on the other hand, a rise in sweetness shows the affect to be a sensory reaction. However, the lift in mood could come from purely conceptual processes triggered by the intensely sweet fluid. Third, and somewhat unexpectedly, an awareness of smil- ing was evoked, almost exclusively at levels of excessive sweetness. There could hardly be a more direct indicator of a pleasurable sensation than an experience of smiling that depends on the strength of the stimulation. It might be noted that smiling and laughter are common postorgasmic reactions. These findings raise a question about sensation and emotion in eating and drinking that is analogous to an old question about sexual climax. Does the pleasure of extreme sweetness come solely from the gustatory stimulation, or does this pleasure depend also (or even entirely) on sensing or imagining ten- sions in the muscles? Despite being asked about movements only in the mouth, participants sometimes referred to movements on the face other than smiling. These movements included blinking, squinting, and frowning. This wide range of facial movements referred to encourages future research to build on the present</page><page sequence="7">1662 findings by using recordings only of the face without monitor- ing changes in the shape of the tongue. Nevertheless, the present findings using the written expres- sion of private experiences of pleasure cannot be validated by physical observations. On the contrary, such verbal data would validate particular muscular contractions as indicators of plea- sure. Our results are consistent with findings that facial move- ments are a poor index of liking for ordinary foods (Zeinstra, Koelen, Colindres, Kok, &amp; de Graaf, 2009). Participants were asked to describe movements, but that does not mean their responses were reports of observable move- ments. The movements could have been entirely imagined, although there is no doubt that the experience was pleasurable. Instead, the issue is whether participants' expressions of experi- encing movements allied with pleasure without desire are more or less sensitive than independent observation of movements or any affect-specific electromyographic activity or video enlarge- ment would be. Such comparisons of kinesthetic, visual, and verbal signals by detection and discrimination measures could also determine whether or not consciousness of movements is required for the pleasure evoked by sweetness. More widely, facial displays of innate delight at intense sweetness provide a method for studying interactions between gene expression in the neural control of movement and envi- ronmental induction of movements by the social and material culture. Sensual pleasure has been invoked to explain the development of obesity and eating disorder. The assumption is that food intake is rewarded by pleasurable sensations from eating. However, this hedonic theory of reinforcement mud- dles emotional experience with associative power, as pointed out by Berridge and Robinson (2003). Another muddle has vitiated previous efforts to separate sen- sual pleasure from motivation to eat. It has been assumed that ratings of the "pleasantness" of eating and the "liking" for a food assess pleasurable sensation separately from the wanting of food (e.g., Cabanac, 1971; Finlayson, King, &amp; Blundell, 2007; Laeng, Berridge, &amp; Butter, 1994; Peryam &amp; Pilgrim, 1957). Confusion has arisen from use of the terms "liking" to name the inborn reflexes to sweetness and "wanting" for the learned disposition to ingest (Berridge, 1996). In fact, when people say they like or dislike a food, they merely mean that they are attracted to it or they avoid it, and not just for its sensory qualities (Knibb et al., 2001). Conditioned incentives to eat must not be conflated with pleasurable sensations that may be unique to intense sweetness. These are different sorts of happiness (Sauter, 2010).

We are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for calling our attention to the possibility that these ratings of the likelihood of choosing a full drink on the basis of a particular sample could reflect attitude to tak- ing just one more mouthful.
