No amount of thinking or observation could perform the alchemy xhich they represent. . . Mr. Collings manages to get the essentials of mountain landscape into quite small pictures in terms of colour to which the word ' jewelled ' can be applied without exaggeration. The pictures are at the same time simple and highly-wrought into a ' precious ' quality of both colour and surface and they combine decorative pattern with poetic feeling in a manner which is extremely rare."-The Times, June 17th, 1924. ".. . London's Art Sensation of the season . . . critics have acclaimed the artist as the equal of Turner. They compared him with Whistler and the Japanese Master, Hiroshige, in flattering termls. They wrote a good deal about ' depth,' ' imagination,' ' feeling.' I entered the gallery doubtfully . . . then one subject would seem to single itself out and then another, and Turner, Whistler, Hiroshige and all the others who expressed landscape in terms of water-colour were forgotten. Here was something new-something undreamed of-. . . His work is a breath of pure air in the crowded sophistication of ' modern ' Art."-Daily Express, June 16th, 1924. "No living painter could have invested the tree trunks of ' The Pillared Forest ' with such rich- ness of hue and energy of growth without appreciably departing from truth beyond the point of li-itimate emphasis . . . Every touch he placeson the paper is as precious as a jewel." P. G. K., in Daily Mail, June 11th, 1924. ON VIEW 10-5.30 daily.

This goes to show that none of them were slavish imitators of their masters in apprenticeship, but showed character and in- dividuality in the develop- ment of their art. Bristol potters were extremely iortunate that, in the decoration of their work, they had at their command sucn a variety of tempera- ment in the decorators they employed. After all, it is the temperament ot an artist that matters, and our suoject tor this month is a striking example of this iact. Joseph Flower is one of the most intriguing per- sonalities in the Bristol ulelt industry. He was Dotn potter and painter. A most successful business man who performed his civic duties with thorough- ness and success inasmuch as it is recorded in John- son's " Transactions of the 14 . o Dish 14 inches. Example of B Corporation, page 72, Redclifj Potter) that he was in 1766 re- elected to the important though troublesome post of Deputy-Governor of the Corporation of the Poor, because of his efficiency. It is a well-known axiom that if you want a job done and done well, you should go to. a busy man for its accomplishment. 'here is no doubt that Joseph Flower was a busy man, for with the responsibility of his factory at Kedcliffe Backs and his active co-operation with the City authorities, he found time to amuse himself in the society of Michael Edkins and others with song and music, and even helped to paint scenery for the Bristol stage. But his most important activity we have left until the last. By means of long and patient effort, he successfully painted two wonderful dishes depicting the battle which ended in the taking of Chagres, in the West Indies, by Admiral Vernon, in 1740 (Victoria and Albert Exhibition). The work is crowded with incident and the moment chosen is that where a shell is exploding in Chagres Castle, which was the defence at the head of the river. It is possible that some engraving of this scene inspired his work, but the difficulty of accomplishment upon iaineo y, Br CASA ROSSA (PR 79 &amp; 80, Glebe Place Hours: io to 6 (Closed Saturdays), FREE. a tin enamel of the fine detail he employed in these efforts is only known to the ceramic painter. We have said in former articles dealing with Niglett and others that they were successful because they understood the limitations of Delft decoration and applied the brush broadly in a true decorative sense. However, Joseph Flower must be held to be the exception that proves the rule. He was ambitious it is true, but his amibition was supported by a mastery o0 technique. Twow more wonderful examples of his recently come to light in the form of a pair of dishes painted with scenes from the Drama and crowded with figures. There are. musicians in the orchestra, side boxes, wings and flies and elephants on the wstage in a tableau which his fcr hp apparently represents the marriage of a King and Queen. The subject of the other dish is a procession of Jesters, with musicians and all the appurtenances He was also noted for the introductio,n of the Bianco sopra bianeo by Joseph Flower, Sopra Bianco effect on istolt circa 1750. plates, dishes and bowls which were turned out by his factory. The process involved the imposition of a pure white enamel upon a ground of dove greyd tone, and the result was strikingly beautiful, as will be seen in the accompanying illustration. During his period, that is from 1740 to 178o, English Delft pottery reached its pinnacle of excellence, and as regards fineness his pottery has not been surpassed by any factory, English or foreign. He was apprenticed in 1736 to Thom,as Frank and was his most important pupil. He was married during his apprenticeship and died in 1785, leaving behind him a large quantity of work that does great credit to English potting and is, justly valued, not only by the citizens of his native town, but by collecto,rs all over England and in our Colonies. For many details in these few paragraphs we are indebted to Mr. VVW. J. Pountney's " Old Bristol Potteries." Many examples of the work of Joseph Flower may be seen in a collection of some hundreds of specimens of English Delft now on exhibition at the IVA 4TE) GALLERY Chelsea, S.W. Telephone No. 3775 Kensington NOTICE.-It is desired to dispose of this collection en bloc or by single pieces. It traces the history of English Delft from beginning to end. For instance, the dated specimens range from 1644 to 1793, approximately covering the whole field of the industry.
