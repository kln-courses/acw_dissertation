<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHAEL RIFFATERRE Prosopopeia Larvatus prodeo. -Descartes In his seminal discussion of Nietzsche's On Truth and Lie, Paul de Man ana- lyzes the lyric in terms which match almost exactly the characteristics of the figure called prosopopeia: What we call the lyric, the instance of represented voice . . . includes . . . the grammatical transformation of the declarative into the vocative modes of ques- tion, exclamation, address, hypothesis, etc., the tropological transformation of analogy into apostrophe or the equivalent, more general ... transformation of trope into anthropomorphism.' The present essay addresses the problem of the relationship between pros- opopeia which is suppositional in its figural essence and two declarative modes, the descriptive and the narrative. If the lyric transforms trope into anthropomorphism, does reading the lyric reverse the process? can there be meaning in prosopopeia without a narrative or descriptive intertext? can pros- opopeia generate a narrative? Fontanier, who wrote in 1821 what probably is the most thought out and systematic taxonomy of tropes and figures, offers this definition: Prosopopeia, that must not be confused with personification, apostrophe or dialogism, which however do almost always occur with it, consists in staging, as it were, absent, dead, supernatural or even inanimate beings. These are made to act, speak, answer as is our wont. At the very least these beings can be made into confidants, witnesses, accusers, avengers, judges, etc.2 Fontanier later specifies that apostrophe and dialogism can be removed 1.

These distinctions are essential, for they make it clear that no real personification need take place, that would entail a descriptive realism. At any rate, it is not necessary that the fictitious embodiment of the animated entity be physical enough to demand verisimilitude, or some rationalization that, for instance, would explain it as a supernatural vision. Thus Malherbe's "Prosopopee d'Ostende" is very typical, in which that besieged city speaks its mournful dirge without having been apostrophized,3 and without ceasing to be a city, without being endowed with a human body. The figure in fact only presupposes animation and this presupposition is inferred from a mock hypothesis. Far from inviting visualization, let alone sensory perception, prosopopeia in most cases merely lends a voice to a voice- less always, or now silent, entity by a mere convention: "voice" says De Man, "assumes mouth, eye, and finally face, a chain that is manifest in the ety- mology of the trope's name, prosopon poiein, to confer a mask or a face (pros- opon)."4 It is indeed no more than a mask put on something that may not even have a face. The mask's simplicity gives free play to the viewer's imagination. All the mask does is put the reader in a specific interpretive mood, very much as does the donning of a comic or tragic mask in Greek and Roman plays. No mimesis, no restriction justified by referentiality may interfere with the read- er's constructs on so simple and so abstract a given. If there remains any mimetic component, it must be secondary, and its normal functioning as rep- resentation must be reoriented by the given. Figural reading derives from such abstract premises with the rigor of a logical deduction. The better to follow that logic, I now return to a poem by Victor Hugo, an allegory of Time, that I analyzed a few years ago as an instance of poetic representation. I had attempted to show that whatever mimesis was at work in it had nothing to do with referentiality. Instead of having reality for its authority, its truth or its hold on readers' interpretation resulted from a verbal overdetermination, from the fact that what the poem said was recogniz- able as referring to familiar stereotypes. These hermeneutic models were regulated by the combined structures of grammar, themes and descriptive systems. I rested happily on my conclusions, sure that I had covered all angles, until Paul de Man jolted me out of my complacency. He showed that I had forgotten the prosopopeia that introduces the poem and must slant uniformly all its subsequent functions. I shall therefore start all over, from my blindness through his insight.5 3. I insist on this because Jonathan Culler, commenting on de Man, especially on his treat- ment of the lyric, titles his argument Apostrophe, and rightly underscores the role of the vocative in that genre (The Pursuit of Signs, Ithaca: Cornell U. Press, 1981, 135-54), without, however, demon- strating that apostrophe is essential to animation. His last and best example in fact is pure anima- tion (153-54). 4. Rhetoric, 77-78. 5.

These musical impressions are now translated into a vision of the personified Hour dancing to the tune. This waking dream contrasts with the lethargy of the town. Hugo opposes the latter (time wasted) to his consciousness (time well spent). He translates the sound of time into the esthetically valorized visual code of personification, thus arresting the flight of time in a moment of beauty. Ecrit sur la vitre d'une fenetre flamande J'aime le carillon de tes cit6s antiques, 0 vieux pays gardien de tes moeurs domestiques, Noble Flandre, oii le Nord se r6chauffe engourdi Au soleil de Castille et s'accouple au Midi! Le carillon, c'est l'heure inattendue et folle, Que l'oeil croit voir, vetue en danseuse espagnole, Apparaitre soudain par le trou vif et clair Que ferait en s'ouvrant une porte de P'air. Elle vient, secouant sur les toits lethargiques Son tablier d'argent plein de notes magiques, R6veillant sans piti6 les dormeurs ennuyeux ... Written on the Pane of a Flemish Window I love the carillon of your ancient towns, o old land, keeper of your domestic customs. 0 noble Flanders, where the benumbed North warms itself in the sun of Castille and mates with the South! The carillon is the unexpected and mad hour that the eye thinks it sees, dressed as a Spanish dancer, appearing suddenly through the keen, bright hole made by a door of air as it opens. She comes, shaking over the lethargic rooftops her silver apron, full of magical notes, pitilessly waking the wearisome sleepers, taking little jumps, like a merry bird, quivering like a spear trembling in its target. By a fragile stairway of invisible crystal, alarmed and dancing, she descends from the heavens. And as she goes and comes and climbs up and down again, the mind, that watchman made of ears and eyes, hears her resonant foot wandering from step to step. De Man denies that the poem should be called descriptive, or that its significance is centered on the carillon, because its description, being entirely subordinated to a prosopopeia framed by the address, only "gives face" to two faceless entities: je, that stands for consciousness or the mind, and the ad- dressee, figuratively represented by the bells, the Hour, that is to say, Time. Par un fr6le escalier de cristal invisible, Effar6e et dansante, elle descend des cieux; Et l'esprit, ce veilleur fait d'oreilles et d'yeux, Tandis qu'elle va, vient, monte et descend encore, Entend de marche en marche errer son pied sonore! What is represented is not carillon, but j'aime le carillon, not an entity but</page><page sequence="4">110 Yale French Studies "a rapport between concepts said to be structured like a sense perception," a relationship between a sensory signifier (the ringing) and a nonsensory sig- nified (the passage of time)-nonsensory because only clocks lend phe- nomenality to time: the invisible crystal of the scale the melodious Hour plays confirms this transfer of a concept into sensory terms. "The senses become the signs of the mind as the sound of the bells is the sign of time, because time and mind are linked as in the embrace of a couple" (33). The convention of pros- opopeia thus constitutes a new sign where mind is the signifier and time the signified: hence the allegory of cognition, the putting of a second mask on the first one, a prosopopeia of prosopopeia-l'esprit, ce veilleur fait d'oreilles et d'yeux, "the visual shape of something that has no sensory existence: a hallu- cination" (34). "The confusion and unification of the various sensory fac- ulties" evoked in Baudelaire's 'Correspondances' "is achieved by the initial apostrophe" (35). Finally, authority is given to the figure (that is, it can no longer be suspect of gratuitousness) by the materiality of yet another crystal, that of the window, now made visible by the inscription: "every detail as well as every general proposition in the text is fantastic except for the assertion, in the title, that it is kcrit" (35). This materiality, this there and then of memory, or here and now of the act of reading, is the "materiality of an inscription. Description . . . was a device to conceal inscription." In short, prosopopeia proposes a new sign for "consciousness of time." Its grammaticality (the arbitrarily established relevancy of signifier to signified) is valid only within the text's idiolect. The framing of that text is indicated by the initial apostrophe. The text itself unfolds by the semiotic transformation of the figural given into a description. Ecrit integrates all this back into the actual experience of a persona (a reassuring reference to a reality outside words). Figural reading thus distinguishes three factors, or functions, in the figure. It generates a significance, represents the author, and maps out a text within the text. Let us now analyze the new "coinage," the figure as one signifying complex, the figural sign. The first and preeeminent function of the figural sign is that it is an index of convention. As such, it testifies to its literariness, and proclaims the text that it generates to be an experiment, a conscious substitute for a recognizable equivalent in accepted usage, in the sociolect. As an index of convention, it also points to the author's intention, a first, very general way of asserting the self, of putting its mark on the external world. However, the reason that pros- opopeia properly ushers in the lyric is that it is suppositive. The animation it implies in its object, overtly or not, directly or as a consequence of an initial address, is always a natural impossibility. The mimesis of a natural impos- sibility can be a sign of the fantastic or of the supernatural, or it can be a formal or ludic supposition, a mock hypothesis or, better, the representation of a hypothesis, a figure of figurality itself. Prosopopeia is the latter, which enables it to openly represent the truth through a fiction. Its artificiality therefore is very different from that of the apostrophe, even though these two figures are</page><page sequence="5">MICHAEL RIFFATERRE 1ll linked. The suppositional mode is final and contains its whole interpretation from the very start. The vocative, however, leaves the reader uncertain whether the animation it presupposes is a form unto itself or a mimetic one, whether it is conventional both as a generic index and as an index of content, or whether it is conventional only as genre but is justified by an actual hidden life of the addressee, for which a fantastic explanation or a supernatural reason exists, pantheism for instance (in which case the conventional form tends to be erased).6 Clearly, apostrophe in Hugo's poem belongs to the purely conven- tional (from Schiller on, the voice of bells is metaphorical). It is also liminal, addressing as it does the land of carillons, rather than the carillon itself or the significance it stands for. Since prosopopeia tends to shed apostrophe in the novel, apostrophe seems to be more the marker of certain genres within the lyric, like the ode or the elegy, than a marker of the lyric itself. Apostrophe is conventional here because it is subordinated to the postulate, because it de- pends on the suppositive, and this will be true of every textual component derived from the figural given. I now come to the inscription Paul de Man so perceptively digs out from under the description. Inscription, as he points out, refers to the real. Even the most unreal play of postulates presupposes a subject, and one more real than those fiction produces in novels. For fiction to exist, it must expel its author out onto the margin of origins, whereas hypothesis needs to keep its proponent within its own enunciation as the postulating subject. The persona that puts the mask on things (the grammatical subject of the verb of perception introduc- ing the animated object, or the implied viewpoint from which the object ap- pears animated), this persona cannot therefore be distinguished from the au- thor (this being the one instance in literature where the intentional fallacy does not apply); consequently, any metonymic or synecdochic periphrasis sub- stituted for the subject (like the title in Hugo's poem) is the inscription of the self in the text-the very definition of the lyric. If, however, the writing self is thus objectified, writing is but the means of expressing this objectification, and the text is but the recording of that signifi- cance. Somehow, the end to which these means are used must be found in- scribed as well. It cannot be just the animating convention, since that too is still a means. The answer must be in the nature of the lyric, which is the end here pursued, in the I-Thou relationship to the universe. This relationship is indeed expressed by j'aime le carillon, but if this were its only expression, there would be nothing in such an empirical assertion that the reader would not be free to find gratuitous, an idiosyncrasy lacking in general human in- terest. He would only assent if there were a sociolectic consensus putting carillons in the class of the picturesque (which of course is a fact, but hardly a stable literary factor). In order for the prosopopeia to be indeed one sign of which mind and time are the two facets, mind must conquer time or be suf- fused with the feeling of it. They must have something in common, and some- 6.

Paul de Man thought it might be an intertextual reference to a literary commonplace-the writing of poems, maxims, or epigrams on windowpanes exemplified by various poems of Swift. This intertext is unlikely because it belongs in another language, and it does not involve subject and object. A better answer is provided by stricter obedience to de Man's own model, for there is another intertext, a French one, that illustrates a more general principle, de Man's second major theoretical contribution to our understand- ing of prosopopeia as the lyric figure. De Man posits a corollary to prosopopeia: the address calls for a reply of the addressee, the gaze that perceives animation invites gazing back from the animated object to the subject daydreaming a Narcissistic reflection of itself in things. This corollary is chiasmus, the trans- fer or crisscrossing exchange between subject and object, a most striking exam- ple of which de Man finds in Milton's epitaph of Shakespeare: the living, overwhelmed by the voice from the grave, by Shakespeare's ever living verse, his true monument, are literally petrified (". . . thou our fancy of itself bereav- ing/Dost make us Marble with too much conceiving"). Chiasmus, the sym- metrical structure of prosopopeia, entails that, by making the dead speak, the living are struck dumb-they too become the monument.7 Prosopopeia thus stakes out a figural space for the chiasmic interpretation: either the subject will take over the object, or it will be penetrated by the object. This fusion is the lyric, and the stereotype that makes its inscription possible here refers to the one windowpane famous in the French sociolect for having been engraved with a poem. "Ecrit sur une fenetre flamande" is a variant of the celebrated inscribed window of the royal chateau at Chambord. Among the many to exploit the motif and infer a moral from it, Chateaubriand put it best: "Francis I, well aware of the vanity of his pleasures, had written with a diamond these two lines on a windowpane: Woman often changes. Foolish he who trusts her." That Hugo's allusion was intentional goes without saying: we know that, while touring Chambord, he took away a splinter from the supposed window. And later, out of the royal dictum he composed a cynical song about women's fickleness in Le Roi s'amuse (1832), which Verdi was to immortalize in Rigoletto as "La donna e mobile." The burgeoning mythology about the Chambord window is the linguistic authority for the meaning of the Flemish window, and for the chiasmus effect. The myth itself and its significance stem from an older cliche: a windowpane is an appropriate place to inscribe a thought about fickleness, for glass's fragility has symbolized the whims of fate ever since Horace. A Corneille quotation schoolchildren have had to recite for centuries says that happiness is unstable: "Just as it has the brilliancy of glass, it also has its fragility." Quoth Chateau- briand: "where is the windowpane now?"8 7. Rhetoric, 67-81, esp. 77-78; cf. 89, 257, 260-61; Allegories, 44 ff, 61, 77, 107-13, etc. 8. Chateaubriand, Vie de Rancd (1844), ed., F. Letessier (Paris: Didier, 1955), book 2, 107.</page><page sequence="7">MICHAEL RIFFATERRE 113 Hence the applicability to our prosopopeia: the theme actualizes the je-tu exchange pattern. Time translated into the female persona of the Hour, the spectator under her spell and writing about it on glass, make woman's fickle- ness into a metaphor of mutability. The writer inscribing himself on a medium specialized for fate's vagaries incarnates mutability as well, projecting his own fleetingness onto fleet-footed Time. Clearly, figural meaning does not depend on sensory perception, referen- tiality or a descriptive grammar. If anything, these raise a momentary obstacle and make the reader's decoding arduous. But in doing so, they make his final assent to the poem's lesson all the more compelling. Fontanier's cautionary remark that prosopopeia must not be confused with personification is well- taken. For there is no way we can relate the dancer's portrayal, scanty as it is, and Time. While we may find a term for term relationship between time described as decay, impending death, itself running out, and the traditional per- sonification of Time as a winged graybeard carrying a scythe and an hourglass, no such translation is conceivable here because the poem's significance is not based on the mutual substitutability of two descriptive systems or fragments of such systems, as would be the case with metaphor and metonymy. It is based on the grammar that translates the chiasmus structure into language. It is based on the predication linking the representations of the subject (the title) and of the object (the female personifying the Hour). This predication does not involve the two pictures and their separate meanings directly (the first one being left to our own deductions anyway), but rather the significance (muta- bility) whereby the identical predication had displaced these meanings into another story-the intertext in which the two pictures are one (the Chambord story) and symbolic in their oneness. Predication and the interchange it per- mits, the absorption of the object by the subject or vice versa, is therefore the interpretant (in the triadic relationship that founds semiosis) if the sign gener- ating that interpretant is a figure instead of being a word or a phrase.9 In such cases where the interpretant is intertextual in nature, the figure owes its au- thority either to the sociolect (as in Hugo's poem), or to another text. Maximal inscription, coming as close as it will ever be to the totalization towards which all literature tends, takes place when the interpretant authoriz- ing the predication is already a text of the object, when the object to be absorbed or dominated by the subject is not an external world of things, but an external world of words. This is precisely the case when the object inscribes a writer. Such is the case, as I will try to show, for Proust, with whom both subject and object are the same textual entity. And such is the case with Mallarme's "Tom- beau de Verlaine" that I single out for no other reason than that de Man es- pecially focussed on two aspects of the lyric, and that the sonnet is relevant to both. It is related to the epitaph, a genre identifiable with prosopopeia, and, on 9. On the integration of figurality and semiotics, de Man's "Semiology and Rhetoric," Alle- gories, 3-19, esp. 8-9; cf. my paper on "The Interpretant in Literary Semiotics," American Journal of Semiotics 3 (1985).</page><page sequence="8">114 Yale French Studies the other hand, to Mallarmean obscurity, which so destroyed representation that it tempted Hugo Friedrich's followers and the "Konstanz School" to de- fine modernity in the lyric as a loss of the object. 10 Paul de Man has no trouble demonstrating that mimetic absurdity does not remove the presupposition of reality: as the interpretation of each suc- cessive phrase deconstructs the previous one, the text gives rise to mutually incompatible metaphors, all of them, however, contributing their disparate stones to the Verlaine monument. Together they form a uniquely Mallarmean idiolect. They therefore inscribe the writer's self in the text and describe the object, Verlaine's work, in conformity with the rule of the genre. An epitaph, or as here, a memorial poem erected as a verbal cenotaph, must be built on the interpretation and the praise of the works that make the dead poet immortal. Consider the first line: "Le noir roc courrouce que la bise le roule" [The black rock angered at being rolled about by the north wind.] The rock (a typically Mallarmean word) of course is Verlaine's tombstone. While it is hard to believe that it could be driven about by the wind, there are passages in Mallarme's where a rock is equated with a black cloud (a not unfamiliar oxymoron, or even adynaton, for which Magritte's boulders levitat- ing above earth provide visual analogs). There follows in the second stanza a bodily ascension of the dead Verlaine, as befits a Christian poet (since Mal- larm6 thought Sagesse Verlaine's most important work, he could legitimately suggest that Verlaine meant his life to be an Imitatio Christi). Moreover, the rock can also evoke the hulking shape of the forlorn drunkard that Verlaine had been in his life of the flesh. In all the preceding, de Man concludes, "the poem uses a representational poetics that remains fundamentally mimetic throughout." My first point is that while de Man may be entirely correct in this linear reading of successive interpretations of roc, his insistence on an ontological priority of reality prevents him from explaining why each symbol has to take the circuitous path of absurdity. My second point is that a figural reading strictly in accordance with his own principles solves the problem. All it takes is to recognize that, rather than metaphor, prosopopeia is at work here, as de Man himself has shown should be the case in an epitaph. And so it is: the inanimate rock is angry in the first line. In the second tercet, a passer-by (the stereotyped silent role in epitaphs) is looking for Ver- laine, and the familiar voice from the grave replies he is hidden in the grass, where, as a stone, he ended his rolling. This of course implies that the object of the I-Thou predication must be somehow embedded in the discourse of the subject, in Mallarme's praise of his object, and this praise, like pattern poems of the metaphysical poets, must assume the shape of Verlaine's monument. It does: Mallarme's first line is a variation on a hypogram, the proverb 10. Rhetoric, 67-81; and "Lyric and Modernity," Blindness and Insight, 2nd revised ed. (Min- neapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1983), 166-86, esp. 174 ff.</page><page sequence="9">MICHAEL RIFFATERRE 115 Pierre qui roule n 'amasse pas mousse [a rolling stone gathers no moss], popular wisdom's indictment of rootless, aimless people, of whom the artist as a fallen angel is one. The popular image of Verlaine is just that, and the first tercet indeed calls him a tramp (vagabond)-a word of which the adage is evidently the periphrastic equivalent. The proverb would not be specific enough to match courrouce que la bise le route. This, however, is accounted for by a second hypogram, this time a quotation from the errant poet's "Chanson d'au- tomne", a verse regarded to this day as quintessential Verlaine: Et je mien vais Au vent mauvais Qui m'emporte DeqA, delA and there I go pushed around by the mean wind that rolls me now here now there Every mimetic aberration that made the avatars of the rock at once so obscure and so Mallarmean is thus repeating the signal that a Verlaine dis- course is now embedded in the subject's. Within the figural frame of sup- positive animation, a subtext develops where chiasmus keeps passing the stone from subject to predicate and back-the uniform marking of all pertinent words by the same "stoniness" enacts a sensory presupposition that in fact is no more than an index of the mutual substitutability of these words. While the headstone in Le Tom beau d'Edgar Poe is granite, and marble in Le Tom beau de Charles Baudelaire, where the absorption of the object by the subject is achieved by other means, the mineral here is a novel one called "wandering" or "Verlaine." However appropriate it may be, this genre-induced petrifaction forces us to give up "stoniness, " a seme, which would have been for Mallarme and Verlaine the same kind of interpretant that "mutability," also a seine shared by the subject and object sememes, is for Hugo and Time. The interpre- tant here is directly the whole stone, the whole thing, or rather the representa- tion of the thing, a mimesis to which diverse symbolisms are attached. These have nothing to do with "stoniness," but language does habitually associate them with a stone. And the stone is presupposed real, so that a figurative sense can be anchored onto it by catachresis. The praising, mourning subject, the writer of a text halfway between ode and elegy, Mallarme is the rock because it is his word, one of his cliches. The praised, mourned object i's rocky twice over, a rolling stone in the abjection of this life, a stone monument in the glory of eternal life. The predication, therefore (I write a Verlaine monument), has for its interpretant a descriptive and narrative intertext. And the predication is indeed an inscription, the double inscription of two writing entities, but that inscription is realized diegetically. One constant remains unchanged in these shifts from the suppositive (the significance-carrying predication) to the declarative (the interpretant, and the</page><page sequence="10">116 Yale French Studies physical, linguistic actualization of the sonnet's convoluted sign system): the conventional, artificial nature of the figure. This aspect of it, so obvious in the Mallarmean ungrammaticalities but equally present in Hugo, through the veil of the preexistent convention of the deified Hour, is in the final analysis the carrier of meaning and the reader's hermeneutic guideline. It is the means whereby the figure signifies. This, I believe, becomes self-evident if we turn to prosopopeia in the novel, to the suppositive obtruding onto the narrative. Proust's Recherche will be my text. In it prosopopeias evidence the same double inscription I just outlined in Mallarme's sonnet, which is only natural: in a novel built as a mimesis of autobiography, the subject and the object are one and the same, or rather one is the writer as self, one the writer as projected or cathected on an external world-but external by convention only. There are indeed many prosopopeias in Proust, lending a spurious life to inanimate objects, and complete with addresses and apostrophes. In accor- dance with La Recherche's leitmotif, chiasmus is rationalized in terms of memory. External objects requite the narrator for the desire he long ago invest- ed in them. The inscribed subject is the writer; the object, the inscription of the subject in mnemonic surroundings, the not so silent witnesses of remembered pleasure; and the interpretant is in each instance the description of the locale where the first I-Thou exchange took place. Two traits characterize prosopopeia in the narrative: it tends to be com- ical, and it generates subtexts within the text. Comicality is the avatar of the figure's fundamental artifice. Instead of being abstractly suppositive, conven- tion emphasizes mock hypothesis as if the self changed its mask for the Cheshire Cat's smile. Subtexts develop because prosopopeias repeatedly re-play an initial expe- rience, the story of the self projecting itself onto its environment. Long stretches of narrative may separate these revivals of the lyric, but comical animation each time insures that we remember the preceding instance. One of the most developed such subtexts grows out of the memory of the cabinet, a term I leave untranslated, the better to account for the variety of unrelated meanings this one word calls forth. The triggering incident, the diegetic matrix for the subtext, is the well-known story of the narrator's first masturbation when he was twelve. Through the window of the bathroom where he locked himself up, he can see an expanse of open country that his arousal fills with phantasms, an exemplary expression of the subject invading the object, of the inner taking over the outer. He senses in this climax that he has stopped the flight of time: ma pensee exaltee par le plaisir sentait bien qu'elle 6tait plus vaste, plus puis- sante que cet univers que j'apercevais au loin par la fenetre, dans l'immensit6 et l'eternite duquel je pensais en temps habituel avec tristesse que je n'etais qu'une parcelle eph6mere.</page><page sequence="11">MICHAEL RIFFATERRE 117 my mind uplifted by pleasure perceived keenly that it now was vaster, more powerful than this universe which I could see in the distance through the window; whereas normally I would think sadly that I was but an ephemeral particle of its immensity and eternity. Every reminiscence of this moment will make him enjoy anew this coinci- dence of pleasure and sensory triumph over the universe. He guesses the identi- ty between the solitary orgasm in which he is his own master, and the writer's inspiration. And every reminiscence will depend on his finding again the same setting, combining overt sexual sublimation, covert scatological association, the same commanding view, and synecdoches that anchor memory (like the detail of orris-root scent used as deodorizer). One could not hope for more decisive inscriptions of the creative artist in a diegetic context.11 The night at the Doncieres hotel is one such instance. The piece develops, almost metalinguistically, everything that was implicit in its Contre Sainte- Beuve hypogram, that is, the writing (even some of its themes) ushered in by the masturbating release, while keeping implicit the act itself. Because the surroundings make sense only as mediators between now and the past, their depiction shifts from objective descriptive to subjectivizing prosopopeia. Ac- cueillante [welcoming] would be the descriptive cliche to render the coziness of the bedroom where the narrator's childhood awaits anamnesis. Prosopopeia derives from that cliche the parody of the royal entrance of a sovereign into his kingdom, with the furniture and appurtenances playing the part of the loyal servants: J'ouvris une chambre, la double porte se referma derriere moi, la draperie fit entrer un silence sur lequel je me sentis comme une sorte d'enivrante royaut6; une chemin6e de marbre orn6e de cuivres cisel6s, dont on aurait eu tort de croire qu'elle ne savait que representer l'art du Directoire, me faisait du feu, et un petit fauteuil bas sur pieds m'aida a me chauffer aussi confortablement que si j'eusse et assis sur le tapis. Les murs etreignaient la chambre, la separant du reste du monde. [Pleiade, v. 2, 83.] I looked into a room; the double doors closed themselves behind me, the hangings let in a silence in which I felt myself invested with a sort of exhilarat- ing royalty; a marble mantelpiece with ornaments of wrought brass-of which one would have been wrong to think that its sole idea was to represent the art of the Directory-offered me a fire, and a little easy chair on short legs helped me to warm myself as comfortably as if I had been sitting on the hearthrug.

All these cute details actually are but mimetic stepping stones to the climactic appearance of the cabinet reborn complete from the forgotten past. It has kept the dried plants whose function, now semiotic, is to embody memory in smell. It still combines safe seclusion and vast visual perspectives, safety in pleasure and the lofty view- point that makes sensory perception an exercise in domination: the privy "had hanging from its wall, to scent the occasion on which one had recourse to it, a voluptuous rosary of orris-roots; the doors, if I left them open when I withdrew into this innermost retreat . .. not only allowed my eyes to enjoy the delights of extension after those of concentration, but added further to the pleasure of my solitude, which, while still inviolable, was no longer shut in, the sense of liberty." The periphrasis around bad smell and its fragrant cover-up, later to be- come a text-intertext link, unveils the repressed-in this literature beats anal- ysis. The fact that a landscape is made visible from the cabinet only to cathect sexual desire is just as apparent here as in Contre Sainte-Beuve. But while in the original version this sexuality was expressed by the clich6 simile compar- ing the hills to female breasts, prosopopeia here resists the lure of automatism: the courtyard, a feminine word in French, is amusingly called a captive. The noun is like shorthand for a full-fledged personification-perhaps a woman in a Sadian castle, or a harem odalisk, or Albertine herself. Sensory details are not significant per se, but only as recognizable, visible actualizations of a structure. This structure is descriptive inasmuch as it organizes a locale, but the locale itself is no more than an outline for a possible functional equivalency. Prosopopeia translates it into the actual exchange of functions. Its mediating role is independent of whether it is positively or nega- tively valorized. The hotel room at Balbec seems the very antithesis of the Doncieres room, for it is spatially the point by point negation of the protective womb of Marcel's bedroom at home. But otherwise, the Balbec room is, like the Doncieres suite, patterned on the original bower of bliss: it encloses the self and yet provides it with a lofty perch from which it can dominate the world; it has the same props for the play of fantasy; it is but an anteroom to the signifi- cant cabinet. Dysphoria and euphoria are therefore intertextually related. A revealing sentence says so as clearly as a critic's metalanguage could: "the anxiety and alarm which I felt as I lay outstretched beneath that strange and too 12. All translations are from C. K.

The clock's ticking sounds as if it were saying nasty things about Marcel in a language unknown to him. The mirror stops him as if its reflection were a barrier. The orris-root's seduction is re- placed with vetiver to which he is allergic, but the reverse version plumbs the depths of repressed motivation just as well: "in that region more intimate than those in which we see and hear, that region in which we test the quality of odours, in the very heart of my inmost self, the smell of vetiver launched its offensive against my last feeble line of trenches, where I stood up with the futile defence of an anxious sniffing" (vol. 1, 667). Chiasmus is equally at work in the negative and in the positive variant. Negative: "the unfamiliar objects which encircled my body, forcing it to set its perceptions on the permanent footing of a vigilant defensive guard, would have kept my sight, my hearing, all my senses in a position as cramped" as that of a prisoner in a dungeon (vol. 1, 666). Positive (a perfect equation of sight as perception and sight as spectacle): "I raised my gaze which the things in my own room in Paris disturbed no more than did my eyeballs themselves, for they were merely extensions of my organs, an enlargement of myself" (667). This identification of desire and of perception, and the resulting valoriza- tion of the universe perceived, is best exemplified in what might be called the supreme prosopopeia. The figure reaches its climactic significance when the locus of sublimation (from anal gratification to genital, from masturbation to writing), shifts roles with the former little boy who once sat there. The setting becomes the character it once enclosed, and is simultaneously reduced to its pertinent part, to the means for the pertinent function: the window. Formerly a mediator between the enclosed refuge and a world to conquer, between the inner and the outer self, the window now becomes the eye, an eye engaged in the act of viewing-not just passive perception, taking it all in innocently. It is the act of viewing when it is basically, primitively almost, desire. This meta- morphosis occurs at the end of the Doncieres variant. By now the subtext has run out of material, having accumulated all possible ways of transference from subject to object. The animation paradigm has now gathered enough mo- mentum to produce the most decisive exchange of functions. The cabinet itself becomes the watcher of the spectacle, as well as the instrument of the libido. It incarnates at one and the same time the subject as sight and the subject as desire. It thus becomes evident that literary description, cathecting each synecdoche with the same libido, serves to express the self through the portrayal of what it is not: Et derriere une tenture je surpris seulement un petit cabinet qui, arret6 par la muraille et ne pouvant se sauver, s'6tait cache Ia, tout penaud, et me regardait avec effroi de son oeil-de-boeuf rendu bleu par le clair de lune. [Vol. 2, 84] And behind a hanging curtain I surprised only a little closet which, stopped by the wall and unable to escape any farther, had hidden itself there with a guilty</page><page sequence="14">120 Yale French Studies conscience and gave me a frightened stare from its little round window, glow- ing blue in the moonlight. Obviously, the cabinet here stands for the child (petit, but above all, tout penaud, an adjective reserved for embarrassment in the presence of a parent, nurse or teacher) caught in the act of voyeurism. It is not by chance that this new avatar of the privy representing the child's new awareness of sex should be lit by a round window, the name for which, oeil-de-boeuf [bull's eye], makes it the ideal locus for transferring the indiscreet gaze from subject to object. The significance is all the less in doubt when one realizes that oeil-de-boeuf opens again and again in La Recherche, each time for yet another revelation (e.g. Charlus in a sadomasochist scene), that is, for taking one more step towards reality, for lifting one more illusory veil. To be sure, there is another spy-hole in La Recherche, and it is used in vain by the narrator to surprise the homosexual encounter of Charlus and Jupien. He does not get to the bottom of the mystery, can see nothing, but only hears bizarre sounds (vol. 2, 609). In other words, that symbol of the ultimate realization of the self as artist, as exposer of life's secrets, voyeurism, seems to fail. The eye constant seems unaccountably to suffer a major exception. But this spectacle, half-understood, only overheard, this apparent defeat of the eye, is in fact the closest one gets to reality-it is a replay of the primal scene. And prosopopeia instantly perks up again, if through a variant: the cabinet's window, a square one this time, is a vasistas, and whether the etymology of the word is true or, better still, a phantasm, every French reader knows it: was ist das? Thus, at intervals, synonymous prosopopeias form in the fabric of nar- rative a loose string of fragments of lyric. These repeat again and again the libido-loaded story from which they all derive, and whose affect they perpetu- ate. But if such a sequence does constitute a subtext (and indeed the generating model, and the iterative variants prove its existence), there must be a claus- ula-no closure, no textuality. Indeed, the subtext ends together with the affect, when the plot in obedience to narrative structures brings about the release of the self's initial frustration, a satisfaction to its yearning for the other. The effacement of desire erases the prosopopeias. If my hypothesis is correct that artifice is the key to figural meaning, and if comicality is the form this artifice takes in a narrative, the clausula of the subtext will be signalled by the disappearance of the figure's grammar, of the chiasmus predication. Com- icality will vanish. But on the other hand, the objects that the self had invest- ed-the lexicon of the figure-will remain, bereft of predication, scattered about by the resumption of the narrative, but still close enough to suggest the ghostly presence of their erstwhile symbolism. Narrative is then generated as if it were compensating for the repression or suppression of prosopopeia. When finally fulfillment or nonfulfillment of de- sire renders anamnesis pointless, the setting recedes into the background, objects lose their capacity to exteriorize, underscore, and comment upon traits</page><page sequence="15">MICHAEL RIFFATERRE 121 of the characters. But while these fragments of the vanished figure now seem only justified as realistic details, anchoring the scene in the sensory world, each of them remains focussed upon by formal peculiarities. The outline of the cabinet can still be traced from one emphasis to the other, sometimes to be deciphered only by a specialized reader, sometimes to lead the ordinary reader to an interpretation that parallels symbolically, in the discourse of things, the erotic story that is unfolding in the narrative. When the narrator finally gains entrance to the long forbidden kingdom of his love, that is, when he receives an invitation to tea at the Swanns', in Gilberte's private world, every step he takes towards bliss can be translated into cabinet code, so that every word from the cabinet's descriptive system stands for an erotic word. Not only prosopopeias disappear, but revealingly, as if to make the point, one is left behind, as a witness to the pretransformation stage: the windows of the Swanns used to look at the narrator with a distant and indifferent gaze, "interposed" between him and "treasures that were not for him." At the posttransformation stage, the windows are no longer hostile eyes. They are back to their normal function as passive, inert casements, back to verisimilitude, back to the narrative, where our hero now opens them from inside and looks out, next to Gilberte, while her hair brushes against his cheek (vol. 1, 503). The cabinet meanwhile multiplies hypostases to remind us of its former dominion. Repressed as privy, and as the stage setting for masturbation, it reappears under various homonyms. First, innocently enough, the narrator is admitted by Gilberte's father to his library: Swann's cabinet, the homonymy equating the two shelters, the temple of reading and the temple of anal gratific- ation. Then our hero loses his head (he says so in italics), and this preliminary to orgasm precedes his being led deeper into the recess where femininity lurks: Mme Swann me recevait un moment dans sa chambre oP trois belles et impo- santes cr6atures, sa premiere, sa deuxieme et sa troisieme femme de chambre preparaient en souriant des toilettes merveilleuses, et vers laquelle, sur l'ordre profere par le valet en culotte courte que Madame desirait me dire un mot, je me dirigeais par le sentier sinueux d'un couloir tout embaume a distance des es- sences precieuses qui exhalaient sans cesse du cabinet de toilette des effluves odoriferants. [Vol. 1, 510.1 Mme Swann received me for a moment in her own room, in which three beautiful and impressive creatures, her principal and second and third maids, smilingly prepared for her the most marvellous toilets, and towards which, on the order conveyed to me by the footman in knee-breeches that Madame wished to say a few words to me, I would make my way along the tortuous path of a corridor all embalmed by the precious essences which exhaled without ceasing from her dressing-room fragrant effluvia. Here everything comes together: the bedroom truly seems to be the pro- naos to the inner sanctum. The one, two, three chambermaids are but three</page><page sequence="16">122 Yale French Studies ritual steps towards sexual admission to the toilettes merveilleuses [marvel- ous dresses] they are preparing. In its literal sense the plural would make Gilberte's mother an unlikely quick-change artist, but at the parallel, imagistic level of repressed significance it also directs us to toilettes, "toilet, " "bathroom." The inner sanctum itself is named, another opportunity to repeat cabinet and toilette, and indeed it is a boudoir, but it cannot be by chance that the initiate should be taken there by two intercessors: one is le valet de pied en culotte courte, a flunky in knee breeches, but also the ghost of the little boy who was pulling down his short pants in our archetypal intertext. The second, even more to the point, is the scent that guides him through the strangely sinuous, live, organlike corridor. These tautological effluves odorif6rants pack into one compound word the scent of sex (odorif6rant, but the word is also a euphemism) and effluves that in French is, again, suggestive of an overpower- ing, almost magical, olfactory sensation, and a euphemism for scatological smells. The text plays on both pleasure motivations, with the emphasis on a more tolerable eroticism. Swift, in another boudoir, a parodic one ("The Lady's Dressing Room") chose to emphasize the scatological side of the double entendre. Then, as a third insistent signal of what counts, cabinet reappears: Gilberte naughtily affects to believe that a guest of her mother's is the wife of a minor civil servant, and her father angrily corrects her: "you speak as if you were a two-year-old. . . . He is quite simply chef de cabinet" (vol. 1, 511), that is, the chief of staff of a member of the government, but that is not enough for Swann. He now corrects himself: "il n'est pas chef de cabinet, il est directeur du cabinet." Here the subtext comes to a close, moving on, as it does, to an apparently gratuitous portrait of that functionary as a "joli gargon" (pretty boy). Does it really, or rather should we not take the italics emphasizing direc- teur quite seriously? They bring us back to other italics, at the beginning of the episode, to the Latin phrase that ushers the narrator into the Garden: Gilberte's motto on her letter of invitation reads Per viam rectam, surely a laughably pretentious affectation, especially for a girl who is not without deviousness (vol. 1, 499, 504), but also, in the vicinity of our shadow cabinet, a rather unavoidable allusion to par voie rectale, a medical cliche (as Boileau did say: le Latin dans les mots brave l'honnetete). Even the periphrasis is stereotyped and significantly harks back to one more statement of what should not be said except through a mask. The vanishing act of prosopopeia has something else to reveal: with the return to the narrative, comicality also vanishes. It was not therefore caused by psychological repression. The utter seriousness of the other mnemonic mecha- nisms (like the Madeleine) corroborates this conclusion, for the repressed con- tents these disclose are much the same as with our figure, and they are just as rhetorical as it is. Comicality therefore must be linked to the suppositional convention, to the blatant fictitiousness of the figure which is the condition preliminary to our reading it. Prosopopeia says the truth, as always in the lyric,</page><page sequence="17">MICHAEL RIFFATERRE 123 through means that themselves do not have to suggest a reality or be credible. It says it by obeying rules that are purely tropological, that is, as abstract as those of grammar, not a matter of the lexicon, and in no need therefore of any referen- tiality. The lyric, to be sure, is not comical. But it must be so in a context where all statements, however "false," however fictional, have to be credible. Our figure, a figure of figurality, as Paul de Man called it, is comical in the narrative because the basic rule of fiction is verisimilitude. Under this rule, truth is unacceptable if its representation is not only arbitrary but a plain impos- sibility. Putting Thalia's laughing mask on top of Erato's false face, pros- opopeia finally becomes a figure of truth. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY</page></plain_text>
