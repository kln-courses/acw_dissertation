On the other hand, I approve the points made by Marcus Hester above. There is one detail, however, that I wish to correct. The statement that I made in my article (p. 23), 'The knowledge of the truth con- cerning essence does not contain the least reference to facts and, thus, from essence alone one cannot derive the slightest truth about facts', is based directly on statements made by Husserl (Idees directrices pour une phenomenologie (Paris: Gallimard, 1950), p. 25)). It is obvious that, as Hester stresses, the science of art must take visual phenomena into account. 4. He criticizes me for not discussing the important problem of contextualism. I accept this criticism but I believe that this and other important topics, such as affectivity, are ones that defy adequate discussion in such a short article. 5. It seems to me that the ideas on aesthetics and visual expression, as stated in the last paragraph of Hester's letter, are consistent with those held by a large body of investigators adhering to the International Association of Empirical Aesthetics, which, I hope, will soon provide concrete answers to concrete questions. Fran9ois Molnar 54 rue Halle 75014 - Paris, France EVOLUTION OF ART FROM PLAY The article 'A Hypothesis of the Evolution of Art from Play' by Ellen Dissanayake (Leonardo 7, 211 (1974)) almost cries for comment and yet puts any potential commentator in the position of 'The Fiddler on the Roof'. 'On the one hand' there is much that can be easily and properly criticized, 'on the other hand' there is an element that makes it important and deserving of an encouraging review. Under the circumstances, I will limit myself to a purely personal set of comments, although I believe that my comments are neither so personal or so limited as not to be useful to others, if not as conclusions, at least as points of departure. Since 'The Fiddler on the Roof' basically falls into the trap of pursuing an essentially Aristotelian approach with an excluded middle and since just my preparatory notes on her article are sufficiently voluminous to admit of an even longer article than hers, my com- ments must perforce be simplistic. This long preamble is in itself intended to be a compliment to the article. It is a provocative article deserving of careful reading. It attempts to deal with and associate important concepts: 'play', 'art', 'evolu- tion', 'ontogeny', 'phylogeny' and 'ethology'. Even if it fails to convince me at many points and it can be easily demolished by arguments and tactics well-known to the art of advocacy, I am still left with the feeling that it is incumbent upon me to come up with some better thoughts and this I am not quite prepared to do at the present time. Also, in a period when authors tend to belabor over-specialized themes in the hope of enjoying the privileges of being regarded as eclectic, Hutcheson, Alexander Gerard, Thomas Reid, Hugh Blair, Archibald Alison and David Hume's kinsman, Henry Home, Lord Kames. Elmer H. Duncan Dept. of Philosophy Baylor University Waco, TX 76703, U.S.A. Two philosophers of aesthetics have reacted to my article 'Experimental Aesthetics or the Science of Art' (Leonardo 7, 23 (1974)). Being a kind of renegade from philosophy, I can well understand why they should disagree with me or find fault with experimental aesthetics. Indeed, it can be considered a renegrade discipline, having only recently (like psychology) become established as a separate science. It is signi- ficant, too, that philosophers are not only in dis- agreement among themselves on questions of art but also on more fundamental points, such as the aim or meaning of philosophy. Some of them seem to believe that philosophy, like Zarathoustra's god for Nietzsche, is dead or condemned to die very soon. Others, like H. Lefebvre, feel that philosophy should play the role of an impartial observer of reality. And there are those like M. Merleau-Ponty, who hold that philosophy arises new-born in each era to render its conception of the world. Although I know that I shall probably not convince my critics, I shall, nevertheless, reply below to several points they have made. A more complete reply would need to be written at greater length probably as an article or, better still, as a book. 1. Contrary to what Elmer H. Duncan seems to say in his letter, I do not claim that philosophy has not made progress. I only consider that philosophical aesthetics does not provide concrete answers to the concrete questions posed by artists pertaining to the creative process and that which precedes it, and that it cannot give concrete answers to questions raised by the public while or after contemplating a work of art. I regret that philosophical aesthetics, seemingly fearing to establish criteria and to render judgments, avoids confronting concrete problems. In a sense, I am repeating Kierkegaard, when he ridiculed philosophy as being too abstract. Apparently, he used to send his young friends to Hegel for advice on problems in their daily life. 2. I am criticizing neither E. Husserl nor M. Heidegger. When I mentioned Husserl in my article, it was only to support the conception of a 'fact-finding' science in the domain of art, as he allowed in psychology. My statements may seem more pointed regarding Heidegger's ideas. For example, I have not found, after some systematic investigation, anyone who, on contemplating Van Gogh's well-known paint- ing of a pair of shoes, was gripped ' by the fear one faces before the birth of a child' (cf. my article, p. 24). This does not mean, as Duncan infers, that experi- mental aesthetics can lead to the notion that Mondrian was a greater painter than Da Vinci on the basis of answers received from a number of persons questioned. Duncan certainly knows that experimental psychology and, thus, experimental aesthetics use methods that ate far more sophisticated and effective than the mere questioning of people. In turn, I would like to know what Duncan's attitude would be if the majority, if not all, humans did not consider the 'Mona Lisa' to be a work of art. On what tidy, prestigious and safe, it is refreshing and significant to find an article that at least tries to cope with major concepts. Letters 381</page><page sequence="2">So much for the more positive side; a technical examination reveals a great deal that needs to be replaced or bolstered, as I point out below. There is much of what Kurt Vonnegut has dubbed a 'granfalloon' in the piece. In a mathematical sense, there are many classes in which the noting of similar characteristics among disparate elements may permit the establishment of a common set that has little or no useful properties-e.g. the set of pedestrians or the set of eight-letter words. More formally we are dealing with a Venn-Euler overlap between selected charac- tersitics of art and play and it is tacitly assumed that the existence of an overlap is significant, even to the point of implying important causal and temporal relations. The overlap does not necessarily imply useful, significant relations even among classes of more precise entities (cf., e.g. mathematics, chemistry, taxonomy) much less a somewhat arbitary selection of the characteristics of 'art' and 'play'. Reference to any good dictionary will reveal many widely accepted 'definitions' of the words 'art' and 'play' that may or may not fit the characteristics selected in her article. There are even seeming contradictions, as when she hedges in the same paragraph by saying 'play is not serious' and then goes on to quote with respect to children 'all play is based on anxiety and is the means whereby a child seeks to master it'. Although reference is made to 'metacommunications', the article is surprisingly unconcerned with meta con- siderations and semantic problems arising from real intent not just etymological quibbling. The meta role of attitudes as they vary with time and involvement may be dominant rather than recessive. When a friend says that he relaxes by 'working in his garden' and Fischer and Spassky were said to be 'playing chess', there is certainly a difference in intent but little doubt as to meanings. Gardening can become 'not-play' for a person forced into commercial farming and there may have been a time when Fischer found chess to be 'play' in the simple sense. Criteria based on seriousness, usefulness, pleasure- orientation and other characteristic noted by the author do not provide an adequate syndrome-especially over a period of time sufficient to invoke phylogenetic concepts. Hero of Alexandria's steam-driven toy seems to have been a progenitor of the modern steam engine. In a strict and legal patent sense, certain dood- lings may be offered as evidence of the date of concep- tion of an invention. How often does one describe one's doodlings as 'just playing', if nothing comes of them, or as important disclosures of something potenti- ally valuable, if they prove prophetic? The pleasure of success may be quite independent of the medium and may be derived or not derived from the 'same' game for different reasons at different times in the career of the 'same' individual-the 'same' ontogenic situa- tion. Similarly, I do not think that enough attention is given to the role of 'art' as a form of religious tribute and as a counter to the oppressiveness (to many) of mortality concepts-'of when I may cease to be'. Much of the enjoyment of 'play' in spectator sports (such as baseball, soccer, football, basketball, boxing etc.) derives, I believe, from witnessing in hours or minutes the decisive resolution of a fairly complex situation depending on both skills and random events. There is little haunting of the vicarious 'player' by such after-thoughts as 'what does it all mean?', 'is it true?', 'what can I do to make something more beautiful ?' etc. Often 'play' delights in transients and 'art' tries to preserve time and times. In fairness, I must admit that Dissanayake could not possibly encompass in any article of reasonable length all the important points that I and other readers might conjure up. Yet, I remain disturbed by the 'gran- falloon' aspect. I believe that I could make an equally not-quite-convincing case for other dyads than 'art- play', such as 'art-religion', 'art-science', 'art-com- merce', 'art-communication', 'play-science', 'play- commerce', 'art-dreams', 'play-dreams', etc. If we cannot get past the 'granfalloon' hurdle, it is even more questionable as to whether there is a signifi- cant temporal and/or causal relation between the set of 'play' members of the Venn-Euler overlap and the 'art' members. Even if one posits the situation of the overlap being significant, it is not clear how one can say that the greater time of ontogenetic phenomena is more appropriate than the lesser time of phylogenetic pheno- mena-especially since one is dealing with thoughts rather than creatures and thoughts can, though not necessarily, evolve more rapidly than the creatures who carry them. The seeking of unifying concepts through ethology is appealing to me, since I have much more confidence in observations that apply to many creatures rather than just man. However, I am not sure that the charac- terizations of 'art' and 'play' provided in this article are not anthropomorphic concepts, so that, almost by definition, ethology may not be able to make a sub- stantial contribution to her subject. In the instant sense, are the terms 'art' or 'play applicable to other creatures? Are the exquisite ultraviolet patterns of flowers an 'art' form? Does that great survivor, the common roach, get involved in either 'art' or 'play'? As a final point, I must bring up the scientist's con- cept of an 'hypothesis'. Philosophically stated, a good hypothesis provides an improved understanding of what we already know and verifiable predictions regard- ing the outcome of experiments yet to be performed. The subject article requires at least more elaboration in this respect. I know that it is easier to be critical than wise. 1 hope that Dissanayake and others will be encouraged if not provoked to pursue and publish provocative articles of this type. I believe that it was Pliny the Elder who said words to the effect: 'If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter'. Myron A. Coler 1 Fifth Ave., Suite D New York, NY 10003, U.S.A. ON RONCHI'S 'NEW OPTICS' Vasco Ronchi [1] and I agree that a new optics is needed but we disagree on what it should be. I hope he will not mind if I take this opportunity to state the differences between his theory and mine. There is a sort of suppressed controversy among physicists as to whether optics should be concerned entirely with radiant energy or should somehow include consideration of the eye and the fact of vision. Ronchi believes the latter. Most physicists believe the former. When Ronchi's book, Optics, the Science of Vision [2], was reviewed in the Journal of the Optical Society of America, that pillar of the orthodox establishment, the reviewer remarked in an off-hand manner that the eye really had no place in optics, except as it might be 382 Letters</page></plain_text>
