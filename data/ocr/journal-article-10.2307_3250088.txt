<plain_text><page sequence="1">DORIS METH SRINIVASAN George Washington University FROM TRANSCENDENCY TO MATERIALITY: PARA SIVA, SADASIVA, AND MAHESA IN INDIAN ART* For all Saivites, knowledge of the Supreme through devotion to god is the goal. The Supreme is the unmanifest transcendental. It has the potential for creation of the universe by the expulsion of forms out of its essence. God is the Supreme as manifested form. God actualizes the potential by creating the material world. Saivite theology, from its beginnings, has probed the relationship between the Supreme, god, and the world. These probings involve a concern for the structure of forms emitted from the Supreme, beginning with that of god himself. A concern for structures and their interrelationships appears with the formulation of the personal god Rudra-Siva in Brahmanical literature. The relationship between the Supreme and god in texts of ancient Hinduism, including the Upanisads and Epics (i. e. in the Svetdasvatara and the Mahdndrdyana as well as the Mahdbhdrata) is triadic1; that is, a threefold sequence explains how the all-pervasive, transcendental Supreme is connected to the material form of god. The first stage in this sequence is that of the formless (i. e., niskala, arfpa) Supreme; it is called Brahman. Third is the stage of god's material form (i. e., tan-); it may be referred to as mfrti. In between is the stage of the subtle form of god; it is the sign (i. e. linga) of that which is without sign (i. e., aliiga), the transcendental source, and it is also the prototype of all subsequent material forms (cf. Svet. Up. 1.13). Vedic speculative thought recognizes that each stage is linked to the preceding one. Thus, the material form of the godhead, the mfrti, has as its ultimate source the formless (niskala) Brahman. Upanisadic speculation has a name for the one who actualizes the potentiality of Brahman; he is called Mahesvara, or simply i vara (as well as i a or Isana; cf. Svet. Up. 4. Io). The Mahdbhdrata gives notice that even the gods spring from Mahesa. The first gods to be emitted are Brahma, Visnu, and Rudra. Brahma emanates from the right side of Mahesa and Visnu from his left (see xiii. 14. 183). There is surely a considerable time span between speculations in the texts of ancient Hindu- ism and those in the medieval faiva dgamas. Nonetheless, the outline of the ancient thoughts remains and there develops a doctrine defined in terms having iconographic implications.2 In the agamas, the triple Siva Reality is composed of three elements having three names. These are: Para SThis paper is based on a lecture, "Para Siva, Sadaiiva, et Maheia dans l'art de l'Inde," prepared for delivery in March I988 at the College de France, Paris. Many discussions on critical aspects of this study occurred while I was in India in connection with another project supported by a short-term fellowship from the American Institute of Indian Studies (summer 1987). 1 Details are given in my forthcoming monograph, Origins ofDivine Multiplicity in Indian Art: Meaning and Form Vol. I, Chapters 9 and io. 2 What follows is a summary of findings contained in my paper, "Saiva Temple Forms: loci of god's unfolding body," in Investigating Indian Art, M.

From Para Siva begins a process of unfolding whereby the transcendental moves towards manifestation. The fully manifested form (i. e. sakala, lit. 'consisting of parts') of the creator god is the third Reality, Maheia. Sadifiva is the godhead on the way to full manifestation. He is the formless as it begins to assume form. The dgamas also distinguish three entities, each symbolic of one of the stages constituting the Siva Reality. The plain liiga refers to the undifferentiated, formless Para Siva. The lifiga is symbolic of the unmanifested Supreme empowered with cosmic creation. A mukhalifiga refers to Sadafiva. It evokes the manner in which the formless begins to assume form. Out of the cosmic essence that is Para Siva (i. e. the lifiga), the body of god begins to reveal itself and the head projects first. There follow a series of projections leading towards full manifestation. When the full figure is revealed, that is Mahesa. That figure can be described with five heads in the dgamas.3 Being links in a chain, the three forms of the Siva Reality share ultimate identity and potency. The third or last element is but the effective means to realize the potency inhering in the other two. As such, agamic Mahesa creates and does so in a manner recalling the description in the Mahdbhdrata; first to arise from Maheia are the gods Rudra, Visnu, and Brahma. The purinic tradition also knows that these three deities arise from Mahesa.4 Saivite iconography employs the symbols emblematic of Para Siva, Sada-iva and Mahesa. When two or more of these symbols occur together in a visual context, it may be assumed that the doctrinal unfolding of the triple Siva Reality is being expressed. Perhaps the clearest visual expression of the unfolding process is found in an early eighteenth century Nepalese painting in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the painting depicts saiva shrines (Pl. I). The chief saiva shrine in the painting is three-tiered, each tier having a central niche containing the main icon of that tier. In the niche on the top tier is a plain lifiga; it symbolizes Para Siva. Below, in the second niche is a Mukhalifiga showing three visible heads; it symbolizes Sadafiva. In the bottom, third niche is a five-headed, ten-armed fully manifest, anthropomorphic figure. He represents Mahega. The three entities symbolizing the Siva Reality, their sequential relationship and their distinctive structural properties, are immediately apparent in this painting. Less apparent but equally present is the question of equivalencies in the number of bodily parts. Maheia's five heads are clearly depicted, but those of his predecessor are not. Theoretically there should be structural parity between Maheia and Sada-iva since the former is the latter, fully revealed. Indeed, Sadifiva, just like Maheia, is described with five heads in the dgamas, and the Pain- camukha Lifiga is his theoretical cognizance. But Sadifiva may also be represented with one, three, or four heads depending upon how closely the representation follows the theoretical model. In the case of the Nepalese painting, we may understand that the three visible heads of the Mukhaliliga refer in fact to a Caturmukha Liliga. The latter, the Four-headed Siva Liliga, is understood to stand for a Paficamukha Linga, since the fifth head, in the center, is rarely represented.5 The painting, like the dgamic teaching, illustrates the fact that the main difference between Sadifiva and Maheia relates not to the number of depicted bodily parts, but to the degree of 3 "Saiva Temple Forms", pp. 338-34o. 4 "Saiva Temple Forms", p. 339 and fn. 25. 5 For details on the iconography of the fifth head and the symbolic equivalencies, see "Saiva Temple Forms", p. 335. log</page><page sequence="3">bodily manifestation. Sadifiva begins the unfolding process with the emergence of the head(s); then more of the body appears. In that way, Sadifiva could be represented by more than the Mukhalifiga; a partially exposed anthropomorphic body of god also represents Sadafiva. Both iconic types convey the same theological message in visual terms: god is in the process of moving towards manifestation. Thus it is Sada-iva whose tricephalic, partially exposed form appears at the southern end of the north-south axis of Cave I at Elephanta.6 It is also Sadi-iva whose single head and partial body emerge from the lifiga on the eighth-ninth century Kashmiri icon formerly in the Pan-Asian Collection (Pl. 2). Aspects of the doctrine exhibited in the eighteenth century painting and described in the medieval faiva dgamas already existed in different parts of India from the post-Gupta period onwards. For example, a Sanskrit inscription, written in late Bra-hrmi characters, and dated on palaeographic grounds to the sixth-seventh century A. D. refers to the doctrine;7 the inscription is found on the pedestal of a marble carving of Uma-Mahesvara unearthed during the excavation of Tepe Skandar, 30 km. north of Kabul. The opening part of the inscription states that a single form (e~ka-m[r]ttis) became triple (tridhd) in the shapes of Brahma-, Visnu, and Mahesvara, the latter being the (first) cause ([k]dranan), presumably of the other two.9 This inscription, just like the epic, puranic, and agamic passages, represents Mahesa as the creator of the other gods. In using the word m rti-a technical term in the Svetdivatara Upanisad i.13 (signalling the material form rising out from lihga, i. e. subtle form), the inscription introduces the possibility that more than the m rti stage of the unfolding may have been known at that time in this northern region. This possibility is supported by the supposition that the earliest agamas in both the North and the South may be assigned to the seventh or eighth centuries A.D.1' All this suggests that representations of these ideas may have occurred prior to their codification in the mediaeval agamas. A previous paper" has already indicated as much: saiva temple forms between the sixth and eighth centuries do, in fact, portray the unfolding of Para Siva. This paper attempts to go further, to show that the doctrine was represented all over India by the sixth to eighth centuries. To reiterate, by doctrine I refer to a process; specifically it is the process whereby the triple Siva Reality unfolds from transcendency to materiality. The method I have used to identify the depiction of the doctrine is derived from the Nepalese painting. Therein, identification of the entities, their interrelationship and their distinguishing structure, is possible because the icons are seen in their architectural context. The demonstration that follows begins with the pan-Indic representations of the doctrine in the earliest extant faiva shrines.

After noting that an early inscription indicates some knowledge of the doctrine in the Northwest, it is perhaps appropriate to begin with an example from that region. The example comes from a seventh to eighth century (probably closer to the seventh century) portable shrine. Only the left leaf of this heretofore unpublished diptych remains (Pl. 3). It is a lifiga-shaped diptych (4-i/2"high) of hard stone, and carved on both sides. The outer side, quite damaged, shows the top of the lifiga and a portion of the head below. The deep groove of the glans penis separates the two. The portion of the head that remains is a crown with large locks of hair descending along the brow'2. The crown is a decorated band topped with crests; these crests somewhat resemble crenelated turrets.13 From the center of each crest hangs a tassel (a bunch of jewels? ribbons?) The shape of the crown is the single most important clue to identify the subject of the diptych. The crown worn by the Ekamukha on the outer side matches the shape of the crown worn by the four-armed, fully anthropomorphic figure on the inner side (Pl. 4).14 Clearly, the intent is to establish by visual means a formal connection between the outer head and the inner figure. The latter is also in poor condition. It is not possible to determine the attributes held in the hands. All that can be said is that the extra, raised left arm follows the curve of an arch under which stands the male figure. The figure wears a dhoti and is sparsely and simply adorned, with earrings, armlets, and necklaces.5 In spite of the few details and the damaged condition, the identity of the figure is unproblematic. This is Mahesa, the Ekamuirti form of the triple Siva Reality. He stands as the finale of a process initiated on the outer side, having iconographic analogies with the Kalyinpur lifiga (analysed elsewhere, see fn. 2 above). In both cases, the top of the lifiga evokes Para Siva, and the mukha, or head, projecting from the lifiga evokes Sadi-iva. Were the diptych complete the outer right leaf would depict the right-hand parts of the glans penis and the mukha. It is not possible to predict the motif on the inner right side since there are no right-hand examples available. Still, the general theme of the diptych - probably an example of S"hi artl6 - is above conjecture. This portable shrine displays the unfolding process in such a manner as to exploit the properties of a diptych. 12 The diptych leaf formerly in the Samuel Eilenberg Collection is now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (No. L1986.9.60o). The same full curls can be seen on the post-Gupta terra-cotta head of a youth from Tapa Shotar, Afghanistan. The head, also from the Eilenberg Collection and now in the Metropolitan, is illustrated in Amy G. Poster, From Indian Earth, Brooklyn Museum, 1986, p. 135. Cf. also the terra-cotta head from Ushkur in the British Museum, illustrated in Douglas Barrett, "Sculpture of the Shahi Period," Oriental Art, III, 1957, p. 56, No. 5. 13 The shape of the crown is distinctive and apparently uncommon. The closest parallels I could find come from two other small Northwestern pieces formerly in the Eilenberg Collection, and now in the Metropolitan. One is a trilobed crown worn by Visnu (No. I984, 491.8), possibly of the sixth century. The other is a similar crown worn by Visnu on Garuda (No. L198J.51.10). Both these crowns fail to show the central tassels featured on the crown of the diptych (see below). I wish to thank Dr. Martin Lerner, Curator, Far Eastern Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, for making available all these pieces for my inspection, as well as No. 1985.85, mentioned below. 14 The number of arms is based on the evidence from the left side. It may be observed that what looks like a trifurcation on the left shoulder is in actuality the indistinct remains of the ajina, or animal skin, over the god's shoulder. 15 The larger necklace compares with the shape of collars seen on early Kashmiri bronzes. See P. Pal, Bronzes ofKashmir, Graz, I975, Pls. 15, I9, 20o. 16 It is rather difficult to date and place this piece. The date is based on criteria found in fns. 12, 13, I . The Shi period is determined largely on the distinctive physiognomy of the full figure, although the crown may also be a factor. The round, full face, high cheek bones, small eyes, and pursed lips resemble the Sahi facial type. See Diana P. Rowan, "Reconsider- ation of an unusual ivory diptych," Artibus Asiae Vol. XLVI, 4, 1985, PP. 281-282. 127</page><page sequence="21">The process is illustrated by the unfolding of the diptych itself. This is not the only known saiva diptych from the north to touch upon the doctrine. Another lifiga-shaped diptych of the Sahi period has been published by Taddeil7 and Goetz.8 Taddei's analysis of a bronze mould for a stone piece now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, allowed him to date the piece to the seventh-eighth centuries. Again the left side is the one preserved, and it shows an Ekamukha Lifiga.19 The interior contains the Uma-Mahesvara pair (Pl. 5).20 Maheivara is three-headed and four-armed. The middle head with the third eye is larger than the lateral heads; its hair style is similar to that seen on the outer Ekamukha. Again, thereby, a formal connection between the two beings (i. e. Sada-iva and Maheivara) is stated in visual terms. The nature of the lateral heads is somewhat problematic, although the head on the left may be feminine. Maheivara holds a trident in the upper right and a water pot (kamandalu) in the upper left hand; the lower right and left hands hold the rosary and gadd respectively. Leaning towards his consort, Maheivara stands cross-legged in front of Nandi in a manner recalling the stance of Oelo in front of the bull on coins issued by Vasudeva II.21 Parenthetically, this diptych permits further insights into numeri- cal equivalencies. Sadi-iva, on the outer side, is represented with one head; Mahesa, the same god now fully revealed, is shown with three (= five) heads. These are not iconographic inconsisten- cies. They are iconographic realities drawing upon conceptual connections between the number one and the number five.22 These two portable shrines from the northwest extend the possibility that in the future early structural temples illustrating the doctrine may be identified in this region.23 An early structural temple from the southeast displays the manifestation of Siva. The sanctum of the eighth century saiva temple of Bhujafigeivara (Andhra Pradesh) holds the plain lifiga, 17 M. Taddei, "A Lifiga-shaped Portable Sanctuary of the S"hi Period," East and West, N.S., i5, 1i-2, I964-65, pp. 24-25. s8 The fact that Taddei was describing the "bronze mould" of the same chlorite stone piece discussed by H. Goetz, "A Kashmiri Lifigam of the ioth century," Artibus Asiae, 27, I965, PP. 275-279, is not sufficiently emphasized in the paper by Rowan, "Ivory diptych." 19 For stylistic details and analyses, see the papers by Taddei and Goetz cited in fns. 17 and 18. 20 Taddei, writing when little comparative material was known, suggested that the inner scene represented "Kalyina- Sundara or Vaivahika Murti (?)," 24; but there is no harm in now revising this suggestion. 21 See Robert G6bl, System und Chronologie der Miinzpraigung des Kutsanreiches, Wien, 1984, p. 44, No. 14, Series 525, 526. 22 This topic is touched upon in "Saiva temple forms," p. 342; it is more fully considered in Chapter XII, Vol. I in my forthcoming monograph (see fn. i). 23 Possibly an example may turn out to be the Lakhamandal Temple discussed by T. S. Maxwell, "Lakhamandal and Trilokin-th: the transformed functions of Hindu architecture in two cross-cultural zones of the Western Himalaya," Art International, Vol. XXIV. I-2, I980, pp. 9 ff. This building started out as a Siva temple. The tiny garbhagrha still contains the central lifiga. The oldest building phase is of the fifth or sixth century; the second building phase can be placed by inscriptional evidence to the seventh-eighth century A.D. A proportionately large sculpture of four-armed Mahesa (dating to the second phase) is now stacked against the wall of the garbhagrha, along with other loose pieces. Maxwell calls the piece a Siva Vrsabhavahana; its iconography is, however, reminiscent of the Maheia figure on the east side of the Kalyanpur Lifiga (see my "Saiva temple forms," p. 338) and must be identified as such. There exists a panel of the partially revealed Sadisiva in the godown of the temple (see Pl. 12 in the article). It shows the three(= five) heads of the god, with the Aghora head to the left. Maxwell concludes that during the last building phase this panel was deliberately removed from the front (east) side of the temple's tower because it was "...the outward sign of the Saiva identity of the temple" (p. 24). The last phase has had, according to Maxwell, a tribal rather than an orthodox Hindu orientation. The remains of the temple seem to include a lifiga, a partial representation of god, and a full figure of Maheia. Whether all these remains date from the same period, and whether indeed the panel in the godown can be called a main icon (versus one of several such panels distributed in less central areas around the temple) can only be determined by an on-site investigation. Maxwell mentions "many such panels stored.., in the godown" (p. 24), but only one is illustrated. 128</page><page sequence="22">symbolic of Para Siva.24 Behind it, on the eastern wall, is a carving of a three-headed, four-armed full figure. This is Maheia. He is seated with his legs folded at the knees (Pl. 6). The tricephalic god shows the Aghora head on the right side and the Vimadeva head on the left; the central head is that of Sadyojita.25 He holds the trident and drum in his upper right and left hands, respectively. (The numbers of heads, arms, and the trident associated with this Mahesa are also associated with the Mahesvara on the interior of the second diptych discussed above). Outside the sanctum, in niches around the ground floor of the temple, are reliefs of the eight Dikpilas. On the second story, images of Daksin-murti and Harihara are carved. There is, however, no representation of Sadi-iva in this temple.26 Absence of an icon representing the second stage in the unfolding process may be due neither to an artistic anomaly, nor to a doctrinal shift. The possibility for coalescing the second stage with the first stage can be gleaned from the Su- prabheda Agama.27 The Southern Rauravigama gives further evidence for possible coalescing. This text states that on the back wall of the saiva cella, behind the lifiga, there must appear "a representation of the manifest Siva accompanied with Umi."28 The need to represent Sad-iva is not mentioned. It remains for future investigations to determine to what extent coalescing is an actual feature in South Indian saiva temples. As for the Bhujafigeivara temple, the doctrinal statement is unambiguously made, despite absence of an image of Sadi-iva. One glance cast within from the threshold of the garbhagrha can locate Para Siva and Maheia. Both the source and its material form are present in the sanctum. To the east, a much more developed program delineating the doctrine is found on the seventh century Parasurimeivara Temple at Bhuvaneivara, Orissa. The garbhagrha contains the lifiga; other than it, the sanctum is bare. The drama of divine unfolding is reserved for the exterior of this temple. The Parasurameivara temple is of the rekhd type, inasmuch as the spire above the sanctum has a curvilinear shape (Pl. 7). The spire, or likhara, has central projections (rahas) and it is on these that the doctrine is portrayed. In that the temple faces west, it may be assumed that the western central projection of the likhara is the most important. Here are the sculptural motifs, in ascending order, on the western raha: first, the Rivan-nugrahamuirti, in the largest caitya arch (which is situated just above the clerestory of the jagamohan); above, Siva Natesa in a slightly smaller caitya arch which is crowned by a kirtimukha; above, Lakulisa seated in a meditative pose (Pl. 8).29 He is not framed by a caitya arch. Also, he is the last of the fully anthropomorphic figures, though not the last relief on this central projection. Above Lakulisa, in the same vertical alignment and within ever decreasing caitya arches, are portrayed: the partially visible form of a tricephalic SadaSiva, having "the fierce side face on the viewer's left standing for Aghora- 24 For details see Bruno Dagens, Entre Alampur et Srisailam, Pondichery, I984, I, pp. 562- 568, II, photos 8)2-84I. 25 On the recent work determining when the central face is Sadyoj-ta and when it is Tatpurusa, see my "Saiva temple forms," p. 3 3 5 and fn. 8. 26 It may, however, be that there exists another tradition in the South wherein the fully manifest body is called Sadisiva(see the discussion of the Rajibpur Sadaiiva under 4, "From the East," p. 13 below. Further study of relevant Saiva icons is needed to determine whether the fully manifest body may be called Sadasiva when there is evidence of coalescing the second stage in the unfolding process with another stage. 21 See "Saiva temple forms," p. 344- 28 Rauravigama, 34. I-2 and Vol. II, pp. viii-ix; see Bruno Dagens, Les enseignements de l'Ajitdgama et du Rauravdgama, Pondichery, 1977, p. 107- 29 For an analysis of Lakulisa here and in other early Orissan temples, see Debala Mitra, "Lakulima and Early Saiva Temples in Orissa," Discourses on Siva, edited by Michael W. Meister, Philadelphia, i984, pp. io3- 18. 129</page><page sequence="23">Bhairava and the placid side face on the right standing for Umavakta-Vamadeva;"30 immediately above is the single-headed, three-eyed, partial form, presumably again of Sadi-iva (Pl. 8). The central projection ends abruptly with a flat course (i. e. the bisama). Saiva symbolism however does not stop here, although the non-anthropomorphic shapes that follow contrast markedly with the preceding figural reliefs. Raised above a joining are the topmost elements of the spire: a large, flattened and fluted stone disc (the dmalasadraka), the moon cap (candrika or khapuri), and an dka-alihga surmounted by Siva's trident (Pl. 7). There probably was no dka-alihga when the temple, in disrepair, was scheduled for restoration. The report filed by M. H. Arnott, who supervised the restorations undertaken between 1899 and I9goI, makes no mention of it.31 Reconstruction of the top order as seen today, with the akasalihga, could have resulted either from a broken piece lying on the ground or from the presence of an dka-alihga in the top order of the contemporaneous Svarnajilesvara Temple also at Bhuvaneivara (Pl. 9)32. In either case, the probability is good that the Para urimeivara temple originally had an dka--alihga (lit. lihga of ether) as finial. As such, the temple would have originally had two linigas, one on its summit and the other in its sanctum. They could be regarded as brackets containing a series of forms dramatizing the unfolding of god. The unfolding is contained within a vertical axis which, like a spine, upholds the doctrine. Along the western axis the unfolding can be espied, as it were, through openings in the caitya arches along the central projection as well as by the topmost order pointing heavenward. The latter, consisting of forms open to the sky, begins the sculptural program. In that way, the program begins with the form least visible from the ground and not with the form most visible on the rah-, the Rdvan-nugrahamirti (Pl. 7). This relief is not the biggest because it is the most important; it is the biggest because it displays a form of god pertaining more to gross materiality than the forms which precede it. In the context of the theological doctrine portrayed on the western vertical axis, it is the least important form. The program probably begins with the finial at the summit of the temple, the adkaalihga. Anchored only at one point and thus almost unbound, the dkda-alihga is the sign of "the first departure into manifestation from the unchang- ing Pure Principle or Essence..."33 The akdsalihga is a symbol meant to evoke the first evolute from the Pure Principle (Para Siva), namely the subtle aspect of Sadi-iva; this is ISana, the fifth and uppermost head of the evolving Sadafiva.34 The dkdialihga enters the center of the amalasadraka which "symbolizes the passage to heaven; it is the architectural symbol of the 30 D.

A. Dhaky whose assistance I gratefully acknowledge. According to Shri Dhaky, an akdaialihga must be part of the original plan of Svarnajale"vara temple since an dk~alihga is seen as the crowning finial of the temple prior to its reconstruction (Pl. io). The temple would have stood hundreds of years in disrepair and no one would climb to the top during its years of decay, to install a fresh lifiga. Also, the lifiga seen in Pl. io shows signs of weathering only at the rounded top, exposed to the elements. This is exactly as it should be since the photo shows how most of the lifiga's octagonal shaft would be hidden by the amalaka and the covering stone, thereby protecting it from the elements. So the Svareajilesvara temple at Bhuvaneivara, which is contemporaneous with the Parasur-mesvara temple, most probably had an akdialinga finial. This and the fact that another fairly early Orissan temple, the ioth century Gandharadi temple, also had an dkdialihga finial, indicate that such a tradition existed in Orissa and that there is a good likelihood that the Parasurameivara temple originally had an dkdaalinga too. 33 Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple, I, Calcutta, 1946, p. 164. 34 See M. A. Dhaky, "The 'Aka-alifiga' Finial," Artibus Asiae, 36, I974, P. 3IO. 130</page><page sequence="24">celestial world."35 In concert, these non-figural forms represent the heavenly sphere with its various subtle levels. The figural forms unfold subsequently. Through a small caitya window near the top can be seen the bust of Sada-iva having one head; it is followed by a tricephalic bust of Sad-iiva (Pl. 8). Possibly the two representations of Sadaiiva are meant to indicate a sequential unfolding of the god's subtle form. There is no reason to consider these two as depictions of different gods. It is more likely that two stages, invested with the self-same revelatory power of Sada-iva, are evident through the gavaksas.36 It may seem unusual for Lakuliha to be the first fully manifest body of god on the rdha. From the foregoing, Maheia is to be expected and not Lakulisa, the historical teacher who founded the Pasupata order. It must therefore be quickly pointed out that by the seventh century, the Orissan cult of Lakuliia-Pa-upata no longer considered him to be a human teacher. Lakulisa was deified and recognized by the sixth-seventh centuries as an incarnation of Maheivara.37 Already in the Gupta age his deification was acknowledged. The Vayu Purdna (probably no later than the fifth century), enumerating the 28 incarnations of Mahesvara, mentions Nakulin (Lakulin or Lakuliha) as the 28th, and also mentions the first four disciples.38 The Linga Purdna (Chapter 24) also recounts how Mahesvara told Brahma of his various incarnations, including that of Lakuli, the 28th (see i24b-I33). Therefore the appearance of Lakuli"a directly below Sadi-iva on the central projection must be in recognition of his identification with Mahesvara, who was worshipped by the Sailodbhavas under whose rule the Parasuramesvara temple was built.39 In the next caitya window, god as cosmic creator is seen; this is ten-armed Natefa. A manifestation, the Ravananugrahamirti, terminates the divine unfolding traced along the course of the western raha.40 The unfolding is also evoked by the symbolism adhering to temple architecture. The likhara represents heaven; its finials soar toward the highest heaven. The body of the temple is considered the atmosphere, and the temple's foundation is the earth.41 From the womb chamber enclosing the sign of Para Siva germinate the myriad manifestations of the god and all the earthly transformations of his energy; they are seen on the outer walls. Also in the seventh century, but in the West, a different combination of architectural elements was utilized for essentially the same purpose. In R-jasth-n, the Siva temple at Kusuma (Sirohi Dist.; probably dating to 636-637 by an inscription of that year),42 displays the doctrine with 35 Kramrisch, op. cit., Vol. II, p. 351. 36 Ibid., Vol. II, pp. 318-32I, for an interpretation of the significance of the gavaksa. 37 D. Mitra, "LakuhSlia," p. o105. 38 Vayu Purana, Chapter XXIII. The section is entitled Mahesvaravatadra-yoga. Cf. D. R. Bhandarkar, "An Eklingji stone inscription and the origin and history of the Lakul-ia Sect", Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. XXII, 1908, p. 154. 39 See Sri Satyanarayan Rajaguru, Inscriptions of Orissa (300oo-70o A.D.), Vol. I, Pt. ii, Berhampur, 1958. See Inscriptions No. 33 (P- 164) and 45 (P. 240). D. Mitra, "Lakuliha," considers Lakuliha to represent on the walls of Orissan temples "the graceful and placid (saumya) aspect of Mahesvara as repository of jndna (knowledge) and expounder of the Sastras (Jfi-navy-khy-namurti)", p. I 15. It is interesting to observe with Mitra (p. 114) that attributes assigned to Lakulisa by the Vis'vakarmdvatdra Vastusastra, namely the matulihiga and the danda, are the two attributes ascribed by the Visnudhar- mottara Purdna, 48, for the hands of the Bhairava face of Mahesvara or Mahideva. 40 It is not clear to me whether the sequence of images on the courses of the other three rah s follows a program relating to the theological program depicted on the western rdha. On the south, going upward may be seen Siva as Bhiks tanamurti, a bust of Siva, a Natesa, a seated figure which may be S-rya. On the east may be seen Lakulisa with his four disciples, Uma-Mahesvara, a figure in yogisana. On the north are Mahisasuramardini, a head of Siva, a Nateia, and Siva in yogdsana. 41 Cf. Kramrisch, Hindu Temple, I, pp. 40-43, 176, passim. 42 See Michael W. Meister, "A Field Report on Temples at Kusuma," Archives of Asian Art, XXIX, I975-76, pp. 23-46. 131</page><page sequence="25">great economy. The garbhagrha and the door which frames it join together to become one sculptural program; that program, expressing the doctrine, is perceived in its entirety at the doorway of the garbhagrha (Pl. i i). At the doorway there comes into view (i) the plain linga inside the garbhagrha; (2) the tricephalic, partially revealed form of SadaSiva carved on the wall behind the lifiga; (3) the central portion of the doorway's lintel where originally the image of Lakulisa-Maheivara should have appeared (see below). The plain lifiga, symbolic of Para Siva, is grounded in the yoni pitha, which is situated in the center of the sanctum (Pl. 12). Behind it, on the western wall is a relief of SadaSiva manifested up to the chest (Pl. 12). The degree of manifestation and also the distribution of the faces (Aghora on the right, Vimadeva on the left, Sadyojita in the center) recall the iconography of the Elephanta Sadi-iva, as does the hint of a linga-shape in the piled-up jatas of the central head.43 In spite of these similarities, the level of artistry of the Kusuma Sadasiva nowise matches up to the image at Elephanta. The full figure of the god is no longer in its place today. When Michael W. Meister visited the site in 1974 he noted an image at the site which "probably was the missing central image over the door."44 The figure is ithyphallic, a characteristic of Lakuliha; he sits on the same type of lotus as do the lateral figures. From the 19i7 photograph showing the doorway with its lintel more complete than it is now (Pl. 11), it is easy to recognize Brahms seated to the right of the central space and Visnu seated to the left.45 Thus these gods assume positions equated with the sides from which they emanated out of Maheivara. As at the Parasurimeivara temple, Lakulia is introduced at Kusuma because he is the embodiment of Maheia. And again as at the Parasurimeivara temple, the symbolism of architectural members appears to confirm the significance of the images. A doorway, especially the lintel, is reserved for depictions pertaining to celestial regions.46 The center of the lintel is reserved for an image of the god enshrined within. Thus the movement towards manifestation begun in the womb chamber is completed in an architectural space, associated with the heavens, which frames that chamber. The symbolism of the architecture seems to imply that god, though fully manifest, is not yet fully enmeshed in the world of matter. Elsewhere in Western India, Lakuliha as Maheia's incarnation is depicted during times roughly contemporaneous with the Siva Temple at Kusuma. Icons coming from the Karvan area of Gujarat (dating between the sixth and eighth centuries) show Lakulisa in front of the linga.47 A distinctive manner of depicting Maheia in the formative phase of saiva iconography is to show him in front of (i.e. conjoint with) the lifiga, his ultimate source of being.48 This manner of portraying Lakulisa is still seen in the Karvan area in the medieval period.49 Quite possibly the 43 Cf. the description in "Saiva temple forms", p. 343 and other references given there. 44Meister, "Kusuma", p. 28, fig. io. The image dates to the seventh century. In recent conversation with Meister, he further observed that the size of the image fits that of the central space and the style of the image is like that of the Brahma and Visnu images that flanked the central space (P1. i). I wish to thank Michael Meister for providing me with this important additional information. 45 In Meister's preliminary report ("Detective archaeology: A Preliminary Report on the Siva Temple at Kusum-", Archives of Asian Art, XXVII, I973-74, P. 83), the positions of Brahma and Visnu are given from the viewer's point of view and are therefore reversed. 46 See Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple, II, pp. 314-315, and fn. 40. 47 See U. P. Shah, "Lakuliha: Saivite Saint", Discourses (full ref. in fn. 29), Pls. 85-87. 48 A series of pre-Gupta icons, identified as Mahesa conjoint with the lifiga, is discussed in Chapter VIII, Vol. II of Origins (see fn. I). 49 See D. R. Bhandarkar, "Lakulisa", Archaeological Survey of India, AnnualReport 19o6-o7, Calcutta, 1909, figs. 4 and 5, pp. 185-186. I32</page><page sequence="26">reason why icons at Karvan, and the western region in general, emphasize Lakulia as Mahesa incarnate is because Karvan is the locale associated with "the descent."'o This is the place where the incarnation of Lakulisa was supposed to have taken place, and reverence to him has endured. Much later than Kusumi, the temple at Atru (Kot.h District, Rajasthan) displays an arrangement seen at Kusumi. In 19o6, the Atru temple was described as dilapidated,but on the lintel of the sanctum's doorway could still be seen Lakulisa seated in the center "with Brahma and Visnu to his right and left respectively."51 The evidence from the West indicates that under certain circumstances, there may be sufficient information to associate pieces no longer in situ with the doctrine. The most accurate guidelines for identifying such pieces usually come from sculpture and constructs in situ. There follows below a reappraisal of several sculptures no longer in situ which can, in light of the above, be reidentified. The ensuing analyses are neither exhaustive nor paradigmatic. They are meant to illustrate future possibilities in understanding saiva art forms, should the symbolic representa- tions of the doctrinal theory, as outlined above, be accepted. I. From the North Recently the Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired a small (5-I/2"h., 5-I/2" w.) Kashmiri stone relief dating eighth-ninth centuries (Pl. 13, No. i985.85).52 Three multi-armed, multi- headed male gods surrounded by plain banded nimbuses, stand on a plain pedestal. Each god assumes the tribhaiga posture in this heretofore unpublished relief. The god in the center with three visible heads is Mahesa; the Aghora head is on the right; the Vimadeva head is on the left. Crowned, regally dressed and ornamented, Mahesa stands in front of Nandi. He holds the trident in the extra right hand while the natural right is held in abhaya mudra. The attributes in the left hands are too rubbed to be identified. This representation of Maheia, it may be noted, has some iconographic features in common with the Maheia on the interior of the second diptych discussed above (Pl. 5; e. g. number of arms and heads; probably types of lateral heads; position of trident and Nandi). Brahma, whose ascetic nature is emphasized, stands to the right of Mahela.Jatas are on each of his three visible heads. Four-armed, the god holds the kamandalu in the lowered right; the attributes in the other three hands are too damaged to be identified. By the side of his feet appears Brahma's vahana, the harnsa. Visnu Caturmurti, showing the lateral heads of the boar and the lion, stands to the left of Maheka. He too is crowned, richly attired, and rests his two lowered hands upon the heads of Gadidevi and Cakrapurusa. A lotus is held in Visnu's natural right hand. Bhi Devi emerges between the god's feet. Even though Visnu, Brahma and Mahega are the same size and have similar postures, haloes, and multiple bodily parts, they are not of equal importance. From sculptural programs in situ, the faiva doctrinal significance of this arrangement of figures may be proposed. The lintel arrangements at the temples of Kusumi and Atri come quickly to mind. In these architectural settings, Brahma and 5o There exists a Karvan Mahatmya, in which the opening verse of Chapter I invokes the blessings of Lakutapani, who is said to be Mahesa incarnated in the Kaliyuga. See Bhandarkar, "Lakulisa" p. I79 ff. 51 Bhandarkar, "Lakulisa", p. 186. 52 Cf., for example, the Visnu in this relief to the Kashmiri bronze of Visnu dated c. 8oo A. D. by Pal (P. Pal, Bronzes, Pl. 9). 133</page><page sequence="27">Visnu flank (Lakulisa)-Mahesvara on the right and left respectively because they issue from those sides of Mahesa. Further architectural evidence exists to show that in this seeming triad, it is Mahesa who is the superior god. The evidence comes from the eighth century Lankesvara shrine at Ellora.53 Lankeivara is a biaxial shrine. At the end of the east-west axis, on the western wall, is a very large relief showing three gods of equal size. Maheia is in the middle; he stands, four-armed, in front of Nandi. The trident is in his upper right hand. Mahesa is flanked by Brahm- to the right and by Visnu to the left. The Lankesvara relief, like the Kusuma lintel, must be seen as part of a larger sculptural program in order to arrive at its proper understanding. In the larger context it is clear that the Lankesvara relief depicts Mahesa together with the gods that emanate from his sides. At Lankesvara, just as in the Kashmiri relief (Pl. 13), size, nimbuses, postures, or pedestal do not establish divine hierarchies; the program does this. Thus, by superimposing upon the isolated piece the evidence gleaned from analogous programs in situ, the significance of the Metropolitan Museum of Art relief may be established: it represents Mahe'a together with the godlings he created from his sides.54 2. From the South A series of magnificent Chola stone images exist that have been considered representations of Brahm-55 or, most recently, of Brahma/Siva. The second identification goes to the heart of the iconographic problem posed by the series.56 The images show a four-headed, four-armed seated deity; these features relate, of course, to Brahm . Since the rosary (aksamala) appears in the upper left hand, the likelihood that it is Brahma goes unchallenged. However, a third eye appears on the forehead of the image and therein lies the problem. Brahma is not adorned with this mark; Siva is. The series comprises the following large tenth century examples: an image (63- I1/2" h.) in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (Pl. 14; No. 42.I20); an image (64" h.) in the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo; and an image (58-3/8" h.) in the Worcester Art Museum (No. 1964. 16).57 Since a four-headed Hindu image whose ascetic nature is emphasized ought to be either Brahma or Siva, and since there is no satisfactory religious evidence to justify the appearance of the third eye with Brahma, he cannot be the subject of the series. Within the saiva context, there is no problem; Mahesa could well be the subject. The presence of the four-armed, three (=five)- headed seated Maheia in the Bhujanigesvara temple quickly reminds us that the South could fashion large icons of this aspect of the Siva Reality. Like the Bhuja igesvara Maheia, the images 53 For details, see "Saiva temple forms," pp. 341-343- 54 Another so-called Brahmanical triad from Kashmir has recently been reassessed as a faiva stele. Stella Kramrisch (Manifestations ofShiva, Philadelphia, 198I, No. 8, p. 9) entitles the relief, "Lifiga flanked by Brahma and Visnu." The title and description recognize that the lifiga has theological dominance over the lateral figures. 55 E. g. Aschwin Lippe, "Divine images in Stone and Bronze, South India, Chola Dynasty (c. 85- I280)," Metropolitan MuseumJournal, Vol. IV, I97I, 29 ff; see pp. 38-41. P. Pal, "South Indian Sculptures: A reappraisal," Boston Museum Bulletin, 67, 1969, p. I5I ; A. K. Coomaraswamy, "An Indian Image of Brahma," Bulletin of the Museum ofFine Arts, XI, I942, pp. 40-41. 56 See Kramrisch, Manifestations, p. 54, where the icon from the Albright-Knox Art Gallery is labeled Brahmi/Siva. Also see this entry for other bibliographic references. On a recent trip to Boston (Feb. 1987), I noticed that the Boston image has now been labeled Siva/Brahma. 57 Mention should also be made of the image in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (No. 27.79); it belongs to the sameperiod. This sculpture features the third eye only on the front head and the head on the proper left; the other pieces in the series show the third eye on all the four heads. I34</page><page sequence="28">in the series wear armlets, elaborate necklaces, the sacred thread, and the dhoti (secured by the girdle). The Boston image (Pl. 14), just like the Bhujanigeivara Maheia (Pl. 6), portrays the god's natural left hand resting on the left leg, with the palm up and fingers bent inward. The sukhasana posture assumed by the Chola images can be observed not only on a related tenth century image from Khajuraho (discussed below) but more importantly on a Maheia icon fashioned within the incipient phase of saiva art.58 Even so, it should not be forgotten that an asana is not a critical factor in the iconography of a Mahesa image: the comparatively rare posture portrayed in the Kaverip-kkam stone image did not prevent T. A. Gopinath Rao from calling it a Mahesamufirti.59 What distinguishes Mahesa, according to the agamas, is what these Chola images display: a fully manifest form of the Siva Reality having (theoretically) five heads. Other iconographic details, though subordinate, work to assist this identification. With regard to the Boston Mahesa, the aksamala could well refer to the god's ascetic nature.60 The lotus held in the lower right hand could be emblematic of Maheia's creative power, signifying as it does the essentially "playful character of the divine operation."61 Asymmetrical earrings, seen on the front of the image, are not infrequently seen on saiva icons, including mukhas of a Caturmukha Lifiga.62 Dissimilar earrings may focus on the inherently biune, androgynous nature of Siva, and could emphasize, in the Boston image, the distinctiveness of each of the lateral heads of Mahesa, as the Aghora - Vimadeva heads are wont to do. 3. From the Center The Khajuraho (Madhya Pradesh) sculpture just referred to, is reproduced by B. N. Sharma (Sadativa, New Delhi, 1976, Pl. IV), who considers it to represent Sadafiva. The god has five faces, three of which are visible. He is seated in the sukhdsana pose, having the right pendant leg resting on a lotus issuing from the base. He wears necklaces, yajfopavita, and a dhoti. Originally the god should have had eight arms; Sharma notes that the attributes held in the natural hands are indistinct. That does not matter for purposes of identification. In this icon, what matters is the degree of divine manifestation and the identity of the two small godlings on either side of the nimbus. On the right side is a seated, multi-headed, bearded Brahma; on the left a much broken Visnu. The main god thus ought to be Maheia. The Khajuraho Maheia has a large protruding abdomen reiminiscent of the bellies characterizing yaksas in early Indian art. (The symbolism of the yaksa's belly, considered elsewhere,63 would not be inappropriate for Mahesa, were one inclined to minimize, as I am, the intervening span of time.) 58 This is the Mahesa on the Musanagar pillar dated to the Ksatrapa period. For identification and analysis, see Gerd Kreisel, Die Siva-Bildwerke der Mathura-Kunst, Stuttgart, 1986, pp. 143-148, cf. discussions in Origins, II, Chapter V. 59 Elements of Hindu Iconography, Vol. II, Pt.

From the East An impressive twelfth century Sena sculpture in the Indian Museum, Calcutta, shows a three (=4 =5)-headed, ten-armed figure seated on a lotus base in the padmisana pose (Pl. 15I).64 As such, it could in a general way recall the five-headed, ten-armed standing figure in the bottom tier of the saiva shrine in the Nepalese painting (Pl. i). That standing figure as we have seen is identifiable as Mahesa. The seated figure, from Rajibpur, Bengal, carries an inscription on the pedestal below the lotus base, which refers to the installation of Sadafiva (literally Sadifiva's feet, Saddlivapaddh).65 If this fully manifest form is SadaSiva, and there seems no other way to interpret the inscription,66 then it contradicts the hypothesis advanced in this and my previous study, that Sadafiva is a partially manifest form of god. It is the only exception I have encoun- tered so far. Since the Rajibpur sculpture has often been cited and described,67 only the details pertaining to the identification need be discussed. In addition to the asana and the number of multiple bodily parts, the attributes pertain to the identification. The natural hands are held close to the chest in the teaching (vydkhydna) mudrd. The right hands are in varada and hold the club (khatvainga), the trijula, the fula (or iakti); the left hands hold the sanala-padma, a drum (damaru) a snake, and the citron (bijapfra, etc.) A figure similar to the Rajibpur Sada-iva occurs on several copper-plate grants of the Sena kings. Two of these copper-plates identify the figure in their inscription. The Idilpur copper-plate of Kesavasena (second quarter of the twelfth century) states that it has, riveted to the plate, the mark of Sadifiva (Saddiiva mudrd);68 the Madanpada copper-plate inscription of Visvarupasena states that it has been stamped with the mark of Sada-iva (Saddiivamudraya mudrayitvi).69 The same inscription also informs us that Visva- rupasena is a most devout worshipper of Maheivara. On the Barrackpur Grant of Vijayasena, which also bears the figure, Maheivara is mentioned in the same way: the grant is given "in honor of Lord Maheivara."70 These figures and others on the grants do not agree in every detail with the Rajibpur Sadifiva, but they agree typologically.71 All are fully manifest figures with equivalent numbers of multiple heads and arms, seated inpadmdsana. They all appear to be Sena representa- tions of Sadifiva. The Sena kings were not native to eastern India. They came to Bengal from the south. There exists in the agamic tradition known in the south, another conceptualization of Sada-iva which 64 Actually a fourth face has been carved on the back of the sculpture; see Susan L. Huntington, The "Pala-Sena" Schools of Sculpture, Leiden, I984, p. 70. 65 The use of the plural, according to Shri Krishna Deva, who looked at the inscription anew, is a sign of respect. 66 The readings of four scholars on this inscription are provided in Huntington, "Pala-Sena," pp. 234-235; No. 52. Shri Krishna Deva and Prof. Richard Salomon, whom I thank for reviewing the inscription once more, both concur with Sircar's reading. 67 R. N. Banerjea in History of Bengal, edited by R. C.

XXIX, 1933, p. 172. 136</page><page sequence="30">attributes to him the sakala qualification usually reserved for Maheia. Section III, 57-60 of the Somalambhupaddhati, a saiva text, demonstrates the other conceptualization.72 The first part of iloka 57 addresses the god, pure as a bright crystal (devarn juddhasphatikanirmalam) and immediately proceeds to invoke the form of god having a body. The body has ten arms, five faces, and sits in padmasana. The right hands hold iakti, sword (asi), sula, club (khatvainga), and make the varada gesture. The left hold the drum (damaru), the citron (bijapuraka), the snake, the rosary (aksasutra), and the blue lotus. The Somalambhupaddhati calls this body 'Sada-iva'. The commentators' reaction to this section is as follows: most of the commentators divide the first part into two. First the invocation is to the subtle, luminous essence, being without substantive form; and then the invocation is to the concrete body. The commentator Nirmalamani cites a iloka from another dgama (presumably from the South) which qualifies Sadifiva as consisting of parts (i.e. sakala).73 Thus the commentaries recognize that the concrete form usually named 'Maheia' is in this text called 'Sadafiva' The importance of the evidence from the Somalambhupaddhati is that its description of the sakala body called 'Sadifiva' is very similar to descriptions of Sada-iva in the Uttarakamikagama and the Garuda Purana, two texts influential in Bengal.74 Therein the five-headed, ten-armed god is described as seated in padmdsana; his right hands show abhaya and varada mudrad, and hold iakti, tri"ula and khatvanga. The left hands hold the snake, rosary, drum, blue lotus, and citron. It is immediately apparent that the Sena Sadi-iva from Rajibpur (Pl. 15), closely follows the description of Sadi-iva in the Garuda Purdnna and the Uttarakamikdgama. The Rajibpur Sada-iva can be considered an East Indian representation whose antecedents could well stem from an dgamaic tradition known in the South; this tradition calls the fully manifested body 'Sada-iva' instead of the more usual name 'Mahela'.-5 The Rajibpur Sadi-iva need not be considered an exception. Instead it may be an East Indian icon representing an alternate, or second, agamic tradition.76 Since this is not the only saiva representation peculiar to East Indian art,7 it serves notice that this region may indeed have followed or developed such a distinctive tradition. 72 What follows is contained in Helne Brunner-Lachaux, Somalambhupaddhati, I, pp. 178- 182 and esp. fn. 2, p. 178. 73 Brunner-Lachaux cites this iloka from the Kiranagama given in the work by Nirmalamani (see her Sonmaambhupaddhati I, v. 57 f, P. 181). If I understand the contents of the text correctly from the synopsis given by the same author (see her "Analyze du Kiranagama",JA 2 53, 1965) then this is but one view expressed in the text. The other is the more usual view, namely that Sadi-iva's form is perceived by the three or four faces visible on the vyaktavyakta-linga, or mukhalinga (p. 325). This is the sakala-niskala aspect typically associated with Sadafiva. For an example of this aspect in a Southern architectural context see P. Z. Pattabiramin, Sanctuaires Rupestres de l'Inde du Sud, Andhra, 1971, Publication de l'Institut Franqais d'Indologie, Pondichery, 42.I, Pl. LII, fig. i. The illustration shows Cave 4 at Bhairavakonda, c. seventh century A. D.) The small sanctuary contains a small black stone linfiga; carved on the wall behind it and facing east (as does the cave) is a bas-relief of a three-headed, partially manifest Sadifiva, probably a later addition according to A.

I wish to thank Dr. Debala Mitra for drawing my attention to this work. 75 A possible tendency in the South to coalesce Sadi-iva with another form of the tripartite Siva Reality could perhaps account for this. 76 This observation, made by my colleague Gerard Fussman, could also explain why the Bhujafigesvara temple (cited above) lacks a representation of the second Siva Reality. 77 The theme of the Birth of Siva from Parvati is peculiar to Eastern Indian art. Examples from the Pala-Sena school are: No. 2 52Io/GRI in the Indian Museum; No. 59.34 in the National Museum; No. 53 in the Burdwan University Museum; No. 68 in S. Kramrisch, Manifestations. From the easternmost region of U.P., namely Kasia, comes No. G. 398 in the State Museum, Lucknow. The uniqueness of the theme and its application to the discussion of the Rajibpur Sadi-iva I37</page><page sequence="31">5. From the West The last example is in the form of a figural hood placed ceremoniously over the lifiga in order to effectuate the transformation of god from spirit to matter. Such hoods have a wide distribution and are known from fairly recent times onwards.78 I am concentrating on contemporaneous Goan examples because their ritual usage has been witnessed and well described by Gritli von Mitterwallner. Without knowledge of their ritual usage, their significance would be hard to assess. Even with this knowledge, their significance may be elusive. von Mitterwallner writes. "The plain form of the pujyabhdga79 of the lifiga, devoid of sutras, apparently did not satisfy the patrons, priests, and worshippers of the past few centuries. Their urge for anthropomorphi- zation of the lifiga head may have been the reason why in more recent Siva temples of Goa and other regions of India, hoods of metal or even wood, in the form of heads and busts of Siva, were made to be put over the plain stone lifigas, subsequent to the performance of lustration ceremonies.8' These heads and busts...are often placed on rackets or in niches of the rear walls in the garbhagrhas of Saiva temples in Goa, so as to have them readily at hand. We witnessed the climax of the trend towards anthropomorphization of the plain and small pujyabhdga in the Saptakoti-vara Temple at New Narve, Bicholim Taluk. The lifiga, projecting merely nine centimeters above the surface of the square pitha, is regularly camouflaged after abhiseka ceremonies by the draped, seated figure of Siva, whose face, hands, and feet are made of hammered metal and whose gown consists of a dark-colored cloth, all dextrously joined together."81 Contained in this account is yet another mode of representing the doctrine. The progression is neither painted nor sculptured here. It is liturgically enacted. The enactment occurs by placing, over the lifiga, layer(s) which symbolize the different stage(s) in the progression. Perhaps the following liturgical sequence may be visualized: worship commences in the garbhagrha with appropriate homage paid to the lifiga. The sanctum may contain, in addition to the lifiga, the forms(s) of the layer(s) to be placed over the lifiga. Layering begins after the abhiseka ceremony has been completed. Thus the hood is kept in the sanctum not for the sake of convenience but in preparation for the ritual enactment of an ontological truth. Representing part of the Siva Reality, a hood belongs in the sanctum, as does the carving of Sada-iva in the Kusum- temple, for example. After the layering of the lifiga has been completed, it may be presumed that worship of the resultant form of Siva occurs. Von Mitterwallner illustrates her account with some contemporary Goan objects used to cover the liriga. These are: (I) a plain liriga on which faiva features have been permanently stuck;82 (2) hoods;83 (3) the figure draped over the linga of the Saptakotivara temple.84 The became apparent in talking with Dr. N. P. Joshi, who has collected 15 examples from Eastern India, all between the tenth and twelfth centuries A.D. Cf. on this subject N. K. Bhattasali, Iconography ofBuddhist and Brahmanical Sculptures in the Dacca Museum, Dacca, 1929, p. 136 ff. 78 See FMR No. 16, pp. 5 5-68 (full ref. on p. 18); see also Robert G6bl, Documents zur Geschichte der Iranischen Hunnen in Baktrien und Indien, III, Wiesbaden, 1967, Tafel 97 and 98. 79 I.e., the topmost part of the lifiga. 80 I.e., the abhiseka ceremonies. s8 Gritli v.

When placed over the lifiga in the liturgy, these hoods become the representations of Sada-iva. In the same way, the full figure draped over the lifiga "whose face, hands and feet are made of hammered metal and whose gown consists of dark-colored cloth" becomes the re- presentation of Maheia. It cannot be adduced from this account whether the face, hands, feet, etc., are kept in the garbhagrha when not in use, the same way the hoods are kept. Nor can it be surmised whether it is the custom to place one or two layers over the lifiga in the Goan temples, or whether this varies from temple to temple. However, the proffered identification of the hoods (and the figural accessories) does not depend upon this additional information. The identifica- tion, together with the premise that layering is yet another way to represent the doctrine, rests on the shapes of the hoods themselves, their repositorium, and their placement over the lifiga after the abhiseka. The relevance of the last point becomes sufficiently clear from an analogous circumstance in the South Indian saiva worship which follows the Somalambhupaddhati.85 After completing the initial rites which purify both worshipper and lifiga, etc., god's presence is invoked. God must first be given a body in order to be present in the ritual. The worshipper constructs, as it were, a bodily form by invoking certain mantras. As mentioned above, in this text, the body is called Sada-iva.86 Once the body of god is constructed in the imagination, homage to Sadi-iva and abhiseka are performed. After abhiseka, flowers, clothes, jewels, etc., are offered and the ritual continues. We can, however, stop at this point to summarize part of an elaborate set of ritual actions: adoration begins with the lifiga, continues with the mental construction of god's body and its lustration. After abhiseka has been completed, actual decoration and dressing of the lifiga can occur while prayers are offered to Siva.8 Thus completion of abhiseka in both the agamic text and the Goan service signals the commencement of the layering of the lifiga. It can therefore be assumed that the Goan hoods are ritually required. They certainly do not answer an urge to anthropomorphize or to camouflage the lifiga. For the worshipper, the saiva ontological symbols discussed above proclaim the supremacy of Siva and god's will to become bodily present in the world of man. The ontological symbols- lifiga, mukhalifiga, full figure - may vary somewhat since equivalencies can occur (e. g., Sadi-iva may be evoked by an Ekamukha as well as a Panficamukha Linga; Mahesa may be evoked by his avatara Lakulisa, etc.), but the basic typologies change little. Combinatorial usages of the symbols do however change, as the above demonstration has shown. Indeed the usages of these symbols are sufficiently distinct to warrant classifying them as different programs. To sum- marize these is to become aware of their breadth and innovative nature. Outlined below are the different faiva programs derived from studies in this and the previous paper.88. ss H.

Lankeivara shrine, Ellora Northern end of the north-south axis has the garbhagrha containing the lifiga and the relief of Sada-iva. Western wall of the east-west axis has the panel carved with Maheia flanked by Brahma and Visnu, to his right and left, respectively. 2. Cave I at Elephanta Western end of the east-west axis has the garbhagrha containing the lifiga. Southern end of the north-south axis has the large relief of Sada-iva. Manifestations of Siva are in the grotto's chapels. B. Sanctum and its Doorway i. Siva Temple at Kusuma The garbhagrha contains the lifiga and the image of Sada-iva. The lintel of the sanctum's doorway originally would have shown Lakuli"a-Maheia in the center, flanked by Brahma and Visnu to his right and left, respectively. 2. Siva Temple at Atru There remains, essentially, the same program as at Kusuma. However, it is not stated in the ASI Report of i9go6-o7 whether an image of Sada-iva existed in the interior of the garbhagrha. 3. Siva Temple at Bhuja geivara The garbhagrha contains the lifiga and the image of Maheia. There may be coalescing of the doctrine; in any case, the program is abbreviated and confined to the sanctum. Addendum Siva Temple at Bodh Gaya A Bodh Gaya door lintel inscribed in the reign of Dharmapala (c. 770-8Io A. D.) records the installation of a Caturmukha Mahadeva in the temple. The lintel shows Lakuli"a in the center, flanked by Suirya and Visnu.90 Only further research may determine whether this lintel testifies to a Siva Temple at Bodh Gaya having the program "Sanctum and its Doorway." C. Architectural Sculpture I. Saiva Diptych from the Northwest The outside shows the liriga and the mukha of Sadaiiva. The inside shows the full figure of Maheia on one leaf. He may be shown alone or together with Uma. It is not possible to conjecture what the scene on the other interior leaf would have been. 2. Siva Lifiga from Kalyinpur91 89 This program is treated in "Saiva Temple Forms," with specific reference to Elephanta and the Lankesvara shrines. 90 D. Mitra, "Lakulisa," p. 116, fn. 16, where further reference is cited. 91 This program is fully treated in "Saiva Temple Forms." 140</page><page sequence="34">The main side of the four-sided lifiga is the eastern side. The eastern side must be read downward to obtain the following progression: dome of the lifiga; multiple faces of Sadi-iva issuing from the lifiga; the full figure of Maheia. On the same level as Mahesa, but on the worshipper's right (when facing the lifiga) is Brahma; Visnu is on the left. D. Layering the Lifiga i. Contemporary Goan Hoods The "N-gesi" Temple at Priol has the lifiga in the garbhagrha covered with a hood symbolizing Sadifiva. When not in use, the hood is kept in a niche on the rear wall of the garbhagrha.92 2. Contemporary Goan Figural Accessories The Saptakoti-vara Temple at New Narve covers the lifiga, set in the pitha, with face, limbs, and dress. Addendum Recent Metal Hoods from Maharashtrian Temple Altars The Collection in the Mandala Gallery, Milan, contains numerous examples of Mukhalifiga hoods. In a letter from the collector (of 20/1/87) he states, "The Mukhalifiga are hollow and did, in fact, cover cylindrical lifiga on the temple altar... On occasion, they may, quite simply, have been placed on the altar, retaining their symbolic content notwithstanding the absence of the lifiga... Judging by the stylistic treatment of the facial features and the type of metal used, I do not think they [i. e., the examples in the Mandala Gallery Collection] can date earlier than the second half of the eighteenth century." An example from this collection, not previously pub- lished, is illustrated in Pl. 16; it is a Mukhalifiga hood covering a lifiga resting on the pitha. Other examples from the same collection are illustrated in FMR 16, September 1983, 54-68; Arts of Asia 17, No. I, Jan.-Feb. 1987, 134-137. E. Temple Tiers and Towers i. Parasurimeivara Temple at Bhuvanesvara The garbhagrha contains the liiga. The main side of the temple is the western side. The western tower must be read downward to obtain the following progression: the evolving form of Sadifiva (from ether to one-headed to three (= five)-headed god); Lakuli~a-Maheia; Siva Natefa, the Progenitor; the manifestation, the Rivarninugrahamuirti terminates the progression. 2. Three-tiered painted Nepalese faiva shrine The painting shows the cross section of the interior of the three-tiered shrine. Each tier has a central niche containing an icon. When the tiers are read downward, the following progression is noted: plain liriga symbolic of Para Siva; Caturmukha Liriga symbolic of Sadafiva; the full figure representing Maheia. 92 Mitterwallner, "Linga," fn. 67. 141</page><page sequence="35">Reading the programs, the predominant movement of god's unfolding is downward, even though life as we know it grows upward. A baby grows tall. Grasses and flowers shoot up. A tree climbs high. "The trees, like longings of earth, stand a-tiptoe to peep at the heavens."'93 Trees, like longings, originate from earth. Not so does god. His otherness is conveyed in many ways. One is his downward progression from transcendency to materiality. 93 Rabindranath Tagore, Whisperings, Kansas City, 1973, P- 41- 142</page></plain_text>
