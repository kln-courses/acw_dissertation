<plain_text><page sequence="1">GIOVAN N I COMOT T I: Music in Greek and Roman Culture (trans. Rosaria V. Munson). (Ancient Society and History.) Pp. xii+186; 13 figs. Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989 (original Italian edition, Edizioni di Torino, 1979). ?14.50. In 1979 Comotti's La Musica nella cultura greca e romana was issued as the first in a proposed sequence of volumes making up a comprehensive history of music for the Societa Italiana di Musicologia. This new English version is said to be 'revised and expanded', taking into account, for example, the Euripides Iph. Aul. musical fragment subsequently published. In scope, it bears a certain resemblance to the notable Reinach La Musique Grecque, and later synoptic studies of Greek music by Chailley and Neubecker, but being aimed at the non-specialist reader, its general orientation is more historical and sociological than technical, although there is a chapter of some twenty-five pages on 'music theory' which deals with the notoriously difficult questions of ratios, scales, the harmoniai and tonoi, etc. The space allotted specifically to Roman music is quite small. The historical survey, with much attention paid to the lyric poets, the early prominence of Sparta, the innovations associated with Terpander, Lasus, Timotheus, Euripides, the ethical views of Damon, and the nature of the chief musical instruments, is perhaps the best part of the book, and will chiefly engage the non-specialist, although it could hardly be claimed to offer new insights into what for classicists is very familiar territory. I am doubtful however what the layman will derive from the chapter devoted to 'texts with musical notation', of which two texts only are printed, and the other twenty or so described with a list of notes used in the extant portions, along with rhythmical notation when present, especially as not all the technical terms used (e.g. paroemiac, lecythion) appear to be defined for the uninitiated in the text, nor in the rather scrappy glossary. Incidentally, in P Oslo 1413 (no. 12 in Comotti) it is, of course, Deidameia, not Deianira(!) to whom Achilles' ghost appears. As with the Italian original, the book ends with a series of translated passages, from the Homeric Hermes Hymn, Pherecrates, Plato and Aristotle, the anti-ethical Hibeh rhetorical fragment and Aristoxenus, alongside which the single Roman offering, a passage of Aulus Gellius, sits rather awkwardly. As the translations are taken from standard English sources, such as Jowett and the Loeb Classics, aulos is regularly rendered 'flute', contrary to C.'s own commendable objection to this erroneous, and misleading, translation (p. 68). 'Kettledrum', by the way, is hardly the appropriate translation of the Greek tympanon. One hopes that the author bears no responsibility for the lamentable state of the index, which is full of misprinted proper names and technical terms. Some of these are found also in the body of the text - Alcybiades, Lybia, skidnapsos, proimia, prosodoi (for prosodia), enkrousis and enkrousmos (for ek-), chronus protos, but added to these, we find Dionysus of Halicarnassus, Threon of Smyrna, Pratinas of Philius, Thamrys, Taletas, Lemenius, Menachemus, Atelanae, the Isagogue of Alypius, the enlopian metre, hypochoremata, the Lydian idos, lyrophonikion, dexios cheiros, anestremmenon (for -stramm-) but epestrammenon (for ap-). There are separate entries for Athanaeus and Athenaeus, simikeion and simikion, and other such silly duplications. The mysterious tetheamenos an eipoimi seems to have crept in on the assumption that anything italicized in the text must be worth indexing. 'Gent. fragment' simply merits its curious entry because C. has cited a line of Anacreon from Gentili's edition of the poet! Surely someone in a university press could have cleaned up all these (and others) before printing. University of Edinburgh E. KERR BORTHWICK BRITA A LROTH: Greek Gods and Figurines: Aspects of the Anthro- pomorphic Dedications. (Boreas, Uppsala Studies in Ancient Medi- terranean and near Eastern Civilizations, 18.) Pp. 120; 60 figs.; 20 tables. Uppsala: Almqvist and Wiksell distributors, 1989. Paper. A.'s field of study is the anthropomorphic figurines of various materials (principally bronze and terracotta) which were dedicated in some twenty Greek sanctuaries between the geometric and classical periods. She sets out to ask two questions of her material: firstly, did the cult-image of the sanctuary have any influence on the appearance of the figurines, and secondly, when figurines of other 'visiting' gods are offered to the cult deity, is there any significance in who visits whom? 0009-840X/90 $3.00 ? Oxford University Press 1990 185 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW The two principal sections of the book each deal with one of these questions. Each section is similarly structured, with the material analysed sanctuary by sanctuary and then subjected to the question in hand. It may be asked whether the structure is a little too rigidly defined, and whether it might not have been more interesting to examine the material in a more open-minded sort of way and then see what questions arose naturally from it; possibly figurines from different sanctuaries would prove susceptible to slightly different lines of approach. There is no doubt that the chosen questions are interesting ones, but the nature of the material, especially the infrequent survival of actual cult-images and the random survival (and retrieval) of the figurines themselves means that no very definite answers can be offered: the eventual answer to question 1 is 'probably, sometimes', and to question 2, 'with rare exceptions, difficult to say'. However, there is much of value in A.'s work. She discusses an impressively wide range of sanctuaries, from the large and comparatively well-known, such as Ephesus or Olympia, to the more obscure, such as Elatea or Proema. Anyone interested in sanctuary sites will find it extremely useful to have such a thorough and well-documented account of the existing evidence for the various cult-statues, besides the analysis of the anthropomorphic votives themselves. The approach is thoughtful, lucid, honest, and logical. Above all, it is salutary for excavators or museum curators to be reminded that they should not simply be cataloguing their votive figurines without asking themselves why they take the forms they do, and what was their purpose. British Museum LUCILLA BURN GEORGE HERSEY: The Lost Meaning of Classical Architecture: Speculations on Ornament from Vitruvius to Venturi. Pp. xii + 204; 83 black and white illustrations. Cambridge, MA and London: The MIT Press, 1988. ?17.95 (Paper, ?8.95). The author is surprised at the enduring popularity of the Classical orders and seeks to explain it through hidden meanings within ancient architecture which he thinks he has rediscovered by imaginative interpretation of certain famous passages in Vitruvius. He maintains that there was a fundamental connection between sacrifice and architectural ornament, and seeks to demonstrate that the forms and terminology of ornament were derived from objects and materials, including food, that were used in ritual sacrifices. For Hersey, the Greek temple represents a grove of sacred trees decorated with battle or hunting trophies, or decked out like an altar with reconstructed sacrifices, consisting of rows of teeth, garlands, horns, bones and the like. Thus the triglyph of the Doric order with its three upright bars (called meroi in Greek) represents sacrificial thigh-bones wrapped at top and bottom with strands of fat, the drips from which are indicated by the guttae below. This primitive aspect of Greek architecture survived into the historical period in the form of myths telling of the invention of the Doric, Ionic and Corinthian orders, and it is Vitruvius' versions of these, together with his account of the Caryatid and Persian porticoes, that are 'analyzed as tropes', in the author's words, to show how they describe the orders as records of sacrifice. The use of the trope, that is the search for meanings and associations through word play, puns and homonyms, often admitted to be etymologically incorrect, is a great standby for the author, as it allows him to range through the dictionary probing for suitable connections while relieving him of any responsibility for formulating rational conclusions. A typical example is his analysis of Ion, who is surprisingly credited with the creation of the Ionic order: 'He was not without feminine qualities, as the tropes of his name make clear. Ion is a violet or gilliflower, ionthas means thick, curling hair, and ionthos is a lock of hair. Ionios means named for Io, Zeus' beautiful companion (And let us recall, too, that Io was horned). Iontas, dove, is even closer to the Greek for Ion, Ion. (We saw the Ionic columns at dove-haunted Paphos).' Much of the text consists of similarly allusive and elusive passages, intended it would seem to demonstrate the author's defiance to the 'age of formalism and philology' of which he makes plain his disapproval. A second part of the book samples Vitruvius' influence on scholars and artists of Renaissance Rome, and suggests through the help of a sequence of interesting illustrations that they at any rate appreciated the sacrificial content of architectural ornament. Perhaps they did, but many interpretative mistakes were made in the Renaissance, and one wonders whether H. is wise to resurrect such a theory without attempting to correlate it more closely to our vastly improved 0009-840X/90 $3.00 ?
