<plain_text><page sequence="1">GREGORY SCHREMPP The Demon-Haunted World Folklore and Fear of Regression at the End of the Millennium The scientific critique of animistic thinking inspired many 19th-century theories of myth and folklore. In several fields of contemporary scientific inquiry, notably cos- mology and cognitive science, we encounter updated versions of the critique of ani- mism. Present-day inflections of this critique prominently invoke the term folk to designate the non- orprescientific view. Although folklorists may find this usage op- pressive, it does offer them an "in" to such debates. Should folklorists take advan- tage of this "in"? MY COMMENTS ABOUT the term folklore are historical in character and focus on aca- demic usages of the term outside the discipline of folklore. I will consider the im- plications of these usages for our discipline, particularly ways in which folklorists might take heart even from usages offolklore they find oppressive. My reflections were triggered by the appearance, in orange and black cloak, of the late Carl Sagan's 1995 book, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark (hereafter referred to as Sagan's Demon). Although it appeals to numerous concerns specific to the moment-alien abduction stories, life on Mars, our youths' global competitiveness in science-I am particularly struck by the extent to which Sagan's underlying premises about the nature of knowledge can be seen as an extension of certain 19th-century notions that played a constitutive role in shaping the concept of "folklore." It is particularly instructive to consider Sagan's Demon in relation to E. B. Ty- lor's Primitive Culture (1873), the defining work of what Richard Dorson (1968:187 ff.) called the anthropological school of folklore research. The anthro- pological school's approach to folklore rested on a distinction between two kinds of knowledge, each with associated attitudes about how knowledge is properly pursued. One of these was science; its main characteristics were sobriety, dedica- tion to rigorous empirical methods, and caution in use of anthropocentric princi- ples of explanation. The other kind of knowledge was called myth when it was Gregory Schrempp is Associate Professor of Folklore at Indiana University Journal of American Folklore 111(441):247-256.

Myth orfolklore lacked rigorous method, and appealed to desire- ridden, anthropocentric, and entertainment-seeking motives. I am not the only commentator who finds some irony in the fact that Demon's call to scientific sobri- ety has been issued by the recent era's consummate "showman" of science. Of the many specific qualities that belong to this alleged folkloric or mythical thought, Tylor and Sagan both zero in on the process that Tylor labels animism (al- though Sagan steers clear of the 19th-century tendency to assume that animism constituted a universal stage of cultural evolution). Tylor defines animism nar- rowly as the belief in spiritual beings; but he also used the term broadly to refer to a seeming human propensity to invest with human qualities, most notably life or mind, those entities which science has come to regard as inanimate and nonhu- man. Sagan does not specifically use the term animism, but his examples focus on many of the same tendencies called to attention by Tylor, and especially on at- tempts to explain the natural world through personal agency, as opposed to im- personal natural law. Sagan also does not have as programmatic a notion of "folklore" as does Tylor; yet we find "folklore" and "folk" scattered liberally throughout Sagan's illustrations of those tendencies that he disparages (see Sagan 1995:44, 130, 290). For Sagan, as for Tylor, our society's verdict on animistic ex- planations will define the state of our civilization. Tylor thinks we have reached a point at which we can realistically expect to progress out of animism (see Schrempp 1983:92 ff.). Sagan is sounding the alarm that we are lapsing into ani- mistic habits. For both, anthropocentric animism emerges as the litmus test, the quick diagnostic, of the general state of knowledge in our society. Animism for Our Age Sagan's Demon provides a colorful and highly public instance ofa contemporary debate that has important continuities with Tylor's concept of folklore. Indeed, as regards the folklore of the celestial realm, Sagan is so much like Tylor that on the basis of Demon one might be inclined to conclude that in the last century the topic of animism has gone nowhere. Such is not the case, however. I would like to briefly explore another contem- porary context-one involving inner rather than outer space-in which animism has taken some new turns that are of special relevance to the computer age, along the way calling attention to parallels to the outer-space animism that interests Sa- gan. The specific topic at issue in the inner sphere is the principle of so-called homunculist explanations of cognitive processing, a principle that has come into focus at the point where "philosophy ofmind" meets "cognitive science." I begin with the full definition of"homunculus" given in Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, the 1967 edition: "a little man." Homunculist explanations account for particular human functions, such as decision making, by positing, in effect, an- other human-a little, interior one-as the mechanism ofthat function. Critics of such theories do not charge proponents with literally positing little internal men, but with constructing cognitive models "as though" such little men existed. It is</page><page sequence="3">Schrempp, The Demon-Haunted World 249 important to note that critics tend to regard homunculist explanations as very natural explanations, that is, as arising to account for our actions in the context of ordinary, everyday experience. Paralleling Sagan's terminological predilection, the established term for designating the general principles invoked by everyday accounts of motivation and behavior is folk psychology. The main criticisms ofhomunculist reasoning concern much the same process Sagan frowns on in the context of cosmology, such as the alleged human procliv- ity to overinscribe the entity or process to be explained with animate human agency. The image of the homunculus conveys, first of all, a vision of processes as centralized: the little man represents the agentive center-the "self"-that we as- sume in our everyday accounting of our actions. Our invocation of this center or self may also implicate specific mental states-such as beliefs, desires, feel- ings-that we see as key to our motivations and actions. An influential school of contemporary cognitive theorists argues, however, that such inner states have no more reality than-and will ultimately go the way of-the cosmological doctrine of phlogiston, and that the postulates of folk psy- chology will give way to materialistic conceptualizations such as brain states mod- eled on the computational networks characteristic of modern computers. The "distributed" processing characteristic of computational networks offers no ana- log to the notion of an agentive center characteristic of many folk psychological ac- counts and emblematized by the homunculus.' In the case ofhomunculist reasoning, some intriguing twists accompany the fact that the target of our alleged animistic projections is now intimate, of our own in- ner character and workings, not a distant planet or some nonhuman animate be- ings (such as angels, interplanetary aliens, or fairies).2 Many of us will reject the implication that there is any parallel between the critique of outer and inner ani- mism, or that any lessons should be drawn for the explanation of human behavior from the success of mechanistic views in the extrahuman world. But even this re- sistance has an established history. Whatever one's attitudes toward his perspec- tive, it is difficult not to recall Auguste Comte's (1975:87 ff.) fervent conviction that "positive science" flowers in astronomy well before it takes root in the social sciences (sociology and psychology) as though the greater resistance will necessar- ily arise closer to home. Tylor had fully internalized Comte's view of the orderly progress of science, to the extent that he recommended a kind of reverse cosmo- logical projection: instead of envisioning the planets in our image, we should learn to account for our actions in something like the laws of Newtonian plane- tary mechanics.3 A Dialogue of Homo- and Hemo-Sapiens and Its Implications for the Future of Folklore Science is laden with paradoxes. Although a well-defined scientific contingent regards homunculist explanations as an epitomizing case ofnonscientific explana- tion, my own favorite homunculi were created for a series of films designed pre- cisely for science education-indeed this series is among the preeminent works of</page><page sequence="4">250 Journal of American Folklore 111 (1998) popular science education of the immediately pre-Sagan era. One film from this series, dealing with the circulatory system, was entitled Hemo the Magnificent (1956, written and directed by Frank Capra). Has anyone of my generation not seen it-five or six times, both at home and in "movie day" at grade school? The main character was animistic in the form of animation: you may recall that "Mr. Hemo" consisted of the outline of a toga-clad human form superimposed on a stylized, valentine heart whose symmetrical halves of red and blue represented ar- terial and venous blood. Poetically inclined and "all heart," Hemo traverses the world with a group of woodland animals, watching over them and indulging their innocence. His is a wonderful life, one that personifies the idea of community within the pool of blooded creatures comprised in nature. The animals talk a lot but do not think deeply. This would seem to make them fully anthropomorphic, although they also are clearly intended to contrast with the "real" humans (the nonanimated beings, so to speak) in the film; the latter are scientists who discourse deeply with this discerning body part, this Hemo-sapiens.4 Given his humanized toto pro pars character, it is certainly fair to invoke Mr. Hemo as an example of the "homunculus" (an admittedly fluid concept) at the center of one of the contemporary debates in cognitive theory. In Hemo the Magnificent, human cognitive operations are also portrayed through various homunculi.5 In one of the animation scenarios, a little man ("Mr. Big up here in the brain") in a business suit monitors inputs and sends directives to other little men distributed through the body, including a team in gym clothes-minus- cule myocardial muscle-men-who push rubber squeeze-bulbs to move the blood, in a rhythm that is called out by a sort of homunculist coxswain, who monitors the phone line.6 The condition of unconsciousness is portrayed through the scenario of a prizefighter taking a direct hit; when the prize-fighter is struck, key little men inside the brain topple and are temporarily unable to direct the fighter's actions.7 This knockout scene implicates something like a dualism of matter and mind.8 One part of our cognitive and sentient agency is mechanical: a series of switch- boards and interconnecting phone lines. The other part is the deliberative agent, represented by a little man who is the thinker, strategist, coordinator, and direc- tor. It is interesting that in addition to the highest deliberative powers, the ho- munculus embodies the greatest vulnerabilities, accruing in part from his centrality. It is the little man and not the little phone lines that go down (though of course the fact that Bell Telephone sponsored this series of films is perhaps not irrelevant here). Much could be said about the technicalities of homunculist explanations in cognitive debates. In some respects, the little man inwardly projected must also be the face on the moon or Mars-or, as we shall see, on the sun-and one of my in- terests lies in contextualizing the homunculist debates within the long-standing issues of animism in general, as it relates to scientific thought and method. The notion that science asks us to demythologize the universe-to erase the self- portraits that we have painted on the vault of the heavens-may create the feeling that those images can be safely repatriated within our human bodily borders; but</page><page sequence="5">Schrempp, The Demon-Haunted World 251 the critics ofhomunculist reasoning should alert us that such would be a false sense of security. From the perspective of the history of folklore theory, Sagan's cri- tique of cosmological anthropomorphism is largely "old hat." However, the emergence of issues parallel to those raised by Sagan, but in the new context of cognitive studies (and especially in the context of computer modeling of cogni- tive processes), is ripe for an imaginative folkloristic commentary. Folklore's Nature and Our Mr. Sun's Myth Folklorists have many "ins" to the sort of debates discussed above. The most ob- vious "in" is provided by the termfolk. For in such debates,folk (in various combi- nations: "folk science," "folk psychology," "folk categorization," and the like) has solidified into the term of choice for tersely designating the allegedly nonsci- entific or naive position. Another, closely related and equally significant "in" stems from the fact, alluded to in the foregoing, that many contemporary debates are variations on earlier debates that were central to the formation of the disci- pline of folklore, and to which folklorists can therefore bring much-needed his- torical perspective. The question of course is, should folklorists take advantage of the "ins" provided by this term and by these historical circumstances? The pejorative connotation of course is the problem: "folk," as the "other" of science, tends to become laden with precisely those implications that many folk- lorists have been attempting to rectify or escape, in part through proposing new definitions offolklore. At the same time, the term folklore has virtually always been accompanied by potentially pejorative connotations, so it would be disingenuous to pretend that the "in" that arises in the above debates constitutes a merely for- tuitous recent turn. Finally, the need to "draw the line," reflected in Sagan's De- mon, may be symptomatic of a larger trend, which has something to do with the tidying impulses that set in at times of imminent endings, particularly endings of millennia. If all of this is so, we might expect that the process of roping off the suc- cesses of science and burdening the term folklore with perceived failures will gain momentum in our present anxious times. The definitions preferred by folklorists may thus become increasingly estranged from popular usages, including those of academicians unfamiliar with the academic tradition of folklore scholarship (see Schrempp 1996). My own recent research on "science" and its "other" has led me to think that in these contexts the termfolklore might be seized upon positively, as the taking up of an interesting and important challenge.9 For as long as there is anything like the enterprise of science, it will construct itself in opposition to a projected "other," whether that is calledfolk or something else. Proclaimed advances in science seem to induce a retrograde motion in the characterization of previous views: the situ- ation prior to the advance is likely to become the butt of characterizations that, at the very least, are simplified and stereotyped. Since science and technology keep changing, there will always be much to do by way of exploring alternatives to the visions that are conjured up by the juggernaut of scientific and technological in- novation; indeed folklorists have sometimes found a mission in just such a project.</page><page sequence="6">252 Journal of American Folklore 111 (1998) But an even more direct challenge lies in exploring the ways that science's "other" remains part of science. Some of the most fertile anthropocentric imagery is created to scientific ends; one only has to consult the scientific literature on cos- mology, for example, to see that it is a veritable hatchery of anthropocentric metaphor. In one of the final sequences of Our Mr. Sun, another in the Bell Tele- phone series (1956, also by Frank Capra), Mr. Sun smiles approvingly-he verita- bly beams-at the work of the scientists; and Dr. Research recites a litany of "thanks" to the sun, which segues to an excerpt from St. Francis's Hymn to the Sun.10 This is accompanied by a scene of a splendid sunset as the chorus of Beethoven's rendition of Schiller's "Ode to Joy" reverberates through the spheres. From the standpoint of hard-boiled science, the scene can only be called a pre-Copernican monstrosity; analytically, it cries out not for more "hard" sci- ence, but for something more in the lineage of Friedrich Max Miiller.11 Mini- mally, the scene suggests that science has to turn to quite unscientific means to express the joy of its own enterprise. Speaking of pre-Copernican monstrosities, one of the most interesting is brought to us by none other than Copernicus himself, a figure frequently invoked as the culture hero whose gift was the consummate example of transcending our anthropocentric proclivities. For Copernicus proclaims the new view through a roundup of the world's favorite anthropocentric imagery: At rest, however, in the middle of everything is the sun. For in this most beautiful temple, who would place this lamp in another or better position than that from which it can light up the whole thing at the same time? For, the sun is not inappropriately called by some people the lantern of the universe, its mind by others, and its ruler by still others. [Hermes] the Trice Greatest labels it a vis- ible god, and Sophocles' Electra, the all-seeing. Thus indeed, as though seated on a royal throne, the sun governs the family of planets revolving around it. Moreover, the earth is not deprived of the moon's attendance. On the contrary, as Aristotle says in a work on animals, the moon has the closest kinship with the earth. Meanwhile the earth has intercourse with the sun, and is impreg- nated for its yearly parturition. In this arrangement, therefore, we discover a marvelous symmetry of the universe, and an estab- lished harmonious linkage between the motion of the spheres and their size, such as can be found in no other way. [Copernicus 1978:22] There are, of course, some "quick and dirty" responses to the possibility of find- ing such anthropocentric embarrassments in Copernicus: they are mere artistic flourishes or decorations, sops for the masses; they are invoked temporarily, in or- der to get our attention so that we may be weaned from them, and so on. While there is some substance to these claims, their adequacy as a final account is doubt- ful. They leave as much unexamined as does the knee-jerk relativism that dis- misses the knowledge claims of science without really probing them. There is a tremendous amount to be worked out here. Among the issues not considered, and which ought to be, are the place of metaphorical and poetic thinking in the craft of science; and the processes of creation of moral value-the processes of creation of "cosmos" in the moral sense. It is difficult to draw a line between a domain in which we should regard ourselves as having the right to</page><page sequence="7">Schrempp, The Demon-Haunted World 253 imagine or create a design and impose it on the world (as in the architecture of a home or a village), and a domain in which we should regard ourselves as having only the right to prosaically describe, laying aside our interests and imagina- tion-our domesticating instincts. The process of putting a human stamp on the matter of the world, indeed the cosmos, certainly could describe one of the focal interests of folklorists. It is an interest that might find room to expand into lacunae that are created as academic disciplines and persuasions feel pressured to overlook areas of human richness in the quest to secure firm disciplinary borders. Notes I am grateful to Ilana Harlow and Nina Fales for comments on earlier drafts of this article. 'While the figure of the homunculus is often invoked by analysts to emblematize any psychology's seeming commitment to the principle of a centralized "self," it is also sometimes invoked to emble- matize any psychology's commitment to the principle of a tidy modularity in cognitive or other physiological processes (see Lycan 1991; Stich 1996:121). Our ordinary accounting for our capacities tends to suppose that a given function can be neatly dissected into subfunctions (for example, reading might be analyzed into scanning, dictionary-matching of words, and linking of meanings). Data from neurophysiology, however, challenge the assumption of neat modularity; rather than correlating with particular neural regions or organs, subfunctions appear to be distributed over larger neural networks. There are several quirks in debates about animism and homunculism, arising from the fact that the debates sometimes have fastened on not quite the right emblems or else historically have drifted away from them. One such quirk resides in the fact that while the term animism might seem to connote the gap between living and nonliving things, often the gap in question is, rather, something more like thinking versus nonthinking things. Overall, for Tylor the latter qualities are the real concern behind "animism," though it should also be noted that, however the gap be defined, much the same argu- ments can be developed over it. Similarly, while it might seem that homunculism involves, in the first instance, the projection ofa physical entity-the little man-the larger contexts can suggest that the object of concern is really some mental/spiritual capacity embodied in that entity; envisioning a little version of the physical entity provides a way of localizing this capacity. In Hemo illustrations, for ex- ample, the homunculi stand out as entities capable of evaluating, making, and understanding deci- sions-specifically in contrast to other physical entities that do not have this ability (notably the communications "hardware" of the phone lines). 2The notion that we mistakenly project animistic properties into ourselves is of course not wholly new. Tylor in fact regards as the prototypical case ofanimistic thinking the doctrine of souls, or spiri- tual substances, residing within but separable from the body; Tylor speculates that the idea ofa "soul" was provoked in part by the experience ofdreaming. And the term demon, employed by Sagan mainly as a cover-term for "outer" spiritual agencies, historically has often designated an inner psychic force or voice. 3It is apparently a testament to the proclivity of humans to link their form and fate to the planets that both the disease of animism and its cure are made palpable through the planets and their motions. 4The animals are initially provincial; indeed, though loveable, they are, to be blunt, "yokels," sus- picious of outsiders and of new-fangled ideas, and quick to solidify their ranks through a corporate, dim-witted ridiculing of the new. When the animals, having dismissed science, start to leave, Dr. Re- search (Dr. Frank Baxter), with a cunning look, asks, "Mr. Turtle, have you ever seen your heart?" Various animals in turn thrill to see motion-picture photographs of their hearts beating, and at this point the animals' attitude toward science takes a definitive turn. In other words, among the ways in which the animals, and even Hemo (and also Mr. Sun, below), are anthropocentric is in their self-ab- sorption. The ploy by Dr. Research to keep their attention can be read as a statement of the strategy of the film: to take advantage of human self-absorption in order to initiate the viewers into the enter- prise of science.</page><page sequence="8">254 Journal of American Folklore 111 (1998) 5One of course sees the standard Western anthropocentric zoo-hierarchy in the contrast of shallow and deep dialogues. The zoo-hierarchy in turn reflects elements of human hierarchy, such as distinc- tions based on high learning versus provincialism. In Hemo there is a persistent, optimistic appeal to the universal character of the scientific enterprise, expressed in part through illustrations drawn from many parts of the world and from scientists of various ethnicities. Still, one concerned with human hierarchies might wish to make something of the fact that the "little men" are always the same troupe of little white males, even, for example, in the case ofa scenario designed to illustrate the cardiac response to fright, where they appear in the brain, nerves, and heart of a doe who has been frightened by a lion. 6The squeeze-bulbs enter the film as laboratory apparatus used by an animated character, Professor Anatomy, to demonstrate the principles of circulation. However, they also resemble the bulbs of a sphygmomanometer, the device commonly used to measure blood pressure. Either way, the princi- ples of circulation are explained through a familiar piece of equipment that is of human design and manufacture. This principle ofintrojecting human artifacts to explain the workings of the body runs through the entire film. (For example, the chambers of the heart are rooms of a house; the nerves are telephone lines; the evolution from primitive to specialized cells is the transition from self-sufficient homesteads to specialized occupations [see Durkheim's famous development of this parallel in The Division of Labor in Society (1960)]; and there is extended development of the image of body as a mo- tor.) In some cases the metaphor works in both directions. For example, a hormone, a chemical mes- senger sent through the blood, is depicted as a motorcycle courier riding through an artery-an image that perhaps is suggested in turn by the metaphor of"arterial" highways. 7The sequence of events involving the "VIP brain cells" is rather intricate: The fighter takes a punch on the jaw, and a little "dispatcher" at the switchboard in the lower brain takes a spill and passes out. The dispatcher controls autonomic body functions (as well as implementing "Mr. Big's" direc- tives); so when the dispatcher takes a spill the management of blood flow to different parts of the body goes unattended. Too little blood then flows to the upper brain, so "Mr. Big" passes out and thus the fighter loses consciousness. The fighter comes to and resumes fighting when the dispatcher regains control of the switchboard and redirects blood to Mr. Big, who resumes officiously barking orders to the various regions of the body. 8The vision of science conveyed in Hemo the Magnificent and Our Mr. Sun (below) impli- cates-consistently, recurrently, and often quite explicitly-a dualism of "matter" and "spirit," a po- larity refracted also in numerous derivative contrasts: body/mind, science/poetry, and human/animal. At the point when the woodland animals become enthusiastic about science, even wanting to become scientists, Hemo gently breaks the news: "Friends, you might as well know it; the magic of knowledge and reasoning is only for humans." In another context, Dr. Research tells his hu- man assistant, who is worried that the findings of science will devalue humans, "You have a human spirit that separates you entirely from the animal world"; he also refers to the body as the "temple of the spirit." "Magic" is recurrently implicated either as or in contrast to science, sometimes, as in the above passage, in an unexpected turn-around. Through the many invocations of what is really a very strong metaphysical dualism, the resounding message is that complete humans-and indeed, only hu- mans-are both spirit and matter, scientist and poet. The conclusion is attested to in one of the final scenes, in which Max Planck is quoted as to the necessity of "faith" and the Apostle Paul is quoted as to the necessity to "prove all things." Above the images of the two towering figures appears the word HOPE. 9Following the AFS panel, I had the feeling that a political position might have been inferred from my presentation, although none was intended. I was proceeding (perhaps because of a misunder- standing on my part) as though the question posed to the panel was, "What are the arguments?" whereas the question on the minds of many participants seemed to be, rather, "Which side are you on?" My political stance on the issue of staying with the disciplinary name offolklore is frankly unde- cided, but my most recent research has landed me at a vantage point from which it is possible to see some potential advantages of the termfolklore-advantages which cannot yet be dismissed since, with a few exceptions, they have not been seriously exploited. I present(ed) this argument in the interest of getting the arguments on the table, not as advocating a "bottom line."</page><page sequence="9">Schrempp, The Demon-Haunted World 255 1oThis fragment from the Hymn to the Sun moreover turns out to be the closing part of a framing pair for the film as a whole. In an important opening scene, Mr. Sun takes on the role of movie direc- tor to show the humans how he would make a film about himself; Mr. Sun's version begins with Mr. Sun intoning a poem unmistakably alluding to St. Francis's poem, but recast as the sun greeting the earth rather than vice versa. "Both Hemo and Mr. Sun make numerous references to the contrast between myth and science, which in turn is closely related to the contrast between poetry and science. There are some intrigu- ing, if not perverse, touches in the commentary on myth in Our Mr. Sun. Most notable is a sequence in which Mr. Sun assumes the role of director of his own film. With Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique playing in the background, such anthropomorphic images as an Eskimo figure of the sun as a "little man wearing thick furs" and the Greek figure of"Apollo racing across the sky in his fiery chariot" pass in review, accompanied by Mr. Sun's praise and approval, though also by his comment that ancient peoples had "some pretty odd notions" about him. The comment about ancient peoples' odd notions of the sun, I emphasize, is made by Mr. Sun-you know, Mr. Sun the movie director. The sequence ends with the pre-Socratic philosopher Anaxagoras, "a Greek who would rather think than worship sun gods" who initiates the view of the sun as "a big blob of mass holding little blobs of mass together with gravity instead of with love." At a somewhat later point, Dr. Research responds to Mr. Sun by por- traying the transition from a mythological to a scientific view not as a depersonalization, but as a change from one type of personal relation to another: "We used to worship you as an unknown god, but now that we know you better, we love you as our great and good friend." In some respects Mr. Hemo and Mr. Sun are opposites, seemingly reflecting their opposite loci and natures, namely, inner/visceral versus outer/cosmological. Hemo appears young and athletic, Mr. Sun, old yet spry. The emphasis on Mr. Sun's age is intensified through the fact that his sidekick-the counterpart to Hemo's woodland animals-is the crotchety figure of Father Time (in both films the chief human, Dr. Research, and the chief natural phenomenon, Mr. Hemo or Mr. Sun, each have some sort of, shall we say, Ed McMahon). In contrast to the giddiness of Hemo's banterings with the animals, the interactions of Mr. Sun and Father Time are decidedly curmudgeonly. Also, in contrast to the prominence of the homunculi in Hemo, which after all is about our "inner" selves, in Our Mr. Sun the sun and time remain the central objects of anthropomorphic animation. (A minor exception is the figure of Chlorophyll, who appears as a little cook in the "one-man factory" of each plant cell.) In other respects, Hemo and Mr. Sun are the same character. Most notably, they are both identified as romantic or poetic of temperament, and both are implicated, in a sense, in a premodern social structure (Hemo is the animals' "king," while Dr. Research's assistant says to Mr. Sun: "You're not just a big blob of hot mass to us; you're the head of our family" [see the quotation from Copernicus, above]). Mr. Sun and Mr. Hemo both point to the appreciative wonder with which they are regarded prior to and outside of the enterprise of science, particularly in religious/mythological thought, and they are fearful that science will destroy that vision; their attitudes verge on a paternalistic preference for blissful ignorance among their subjects. Through the course of the films they are won over to the cause of science, and to the conviction that science and poetry (and indeed religion) can coexist and strengthen one another.
