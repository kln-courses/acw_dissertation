<plain_text><page sequence="1">LESLIE V. WALLACE BETWIXT AND BETWEEN Depictions of Immortals (Xian) in Eastern Han Tomb Reliefs Abstract Immortals (xian 111 I) are depicted as feathered sprite-like or dragon- or snake-tailed figures climbing stylized mountains or floating in swirling cloudscapes on tomb reliefs from the Eastern Han dynasty (25-220 ce). Possessing iconographie unifor mity in a time of growing regionalism, these images represent immortals as tran sient figures moving through an intermediate realm where they are often joined by deer, tigers, dragons, birds, heavenly horses (tianma and other animals. Such imagery is based upon and expands Western Han (206 bce-8 ce) prototypes and suggests an important association between these figures and the afterlife that is not discussed in textual sources. This paper analyzes the physical hybridity of immortals, their transitory existence, and their role as shaman-like intermediaries, demonstrating that Eastern Han representations of immortals repeatedly empha size their liminal nature and close connection to the animal world. Their position betwixt and between physical forms and realms of existence was the basis of their spiritual power, enabling them to assist the deceased in their transcendent journey to paradise. IMMORTALS (xian fill) FIRST APPEARED in various forms decorating Chinese mortuary goods during the second century bce. By the middle of the Eastern Han dynasty (25-220 ce), bird-human and reptile-human hybrid immortals were fre quently found on or near ceilings and pillars as well as around doorways in the four main areas of tomb-relief production (Shandong/Jiangsu; Nanyang, Henan; Sichuan and Shaanxi/Shanxi).1 Although there are textual correlates to the rep resentation of avian immortals, contemporary texts remain silent regarding the representation of immortals as reptilian hybrids and why such imagery would be placed in a tomb. The popularity of these figures as well as their iconographie uni formity in a time of growing regionalism suggests that they were believed to play an important role in the afterlife that is not explicitly discussed in texts. Concentrating on the representations of immortals during the Eastern Han dynasty, this paper argues that immortals were depicted as liminal but spiritually empowered figures who provided the important function of aiding the soul of the deceased in its tran scendent journey to paradise. Many iconographie studies divide representations of immortals into a number of categories, but I think it is first necessary to step back and ask three basic questions regarding their depiction: 1 ) what do immortals look like, 2) where do they live, and 3) what do they do? As I will demonstrate, their physical bodies, the environment in which they were depicted, and their role as shaman-like mediators all repeatedly stress their connections to the animal world and their position betwixt and between various realms of existence. 73</page><page sequence="2">2 Immortals with wings worshipping Xiwangmu.

Previous Scholarship Scholars have discussed the depiction of immortals as anthropomorphic hybrids, their itinerant nature, placement in tombs, and their relationship to Han mortu ary beliefs and shamanism. Although Michael Loewe has noted the depiction of immortals as avian and serpentine hybrids, most iconographie studies have cat egorized representations of immortals as yuren (feathered men) based on medium, region, or compositional elements.2 With the exception of Loewe and Sun Zuoyun, the authors of these studies—including those who focused on the desire of Qin and Han dynasty emperors and aristocrats to become immortal as well as the popularity of the cult figure Xiwangmu HzES—have largely ignored the relation ship between these figures and the afterlife.3 Other scholars, however, have connected these figures to Han mortuary beliefs, their placement within tombs, and their depiction as ceaselessly mobile beings. Shih Hsio-yen has discussed the prominence of immortals in tomb reliefs from Shaanxi and, in the context of figurai representation and scroll patterns between the Han Dynasty and the Six Dynasties Period (220-589 ce), their placement within the tomb and depiction as beings constantly in motion. Loewe has noted the wandering nature of immortals in visual representations and Han mirror inscrip tions, and Jean M. James sees this as their defining characteristic. James rejects the identification of the figures depicted leading the deceased to paradise as "immor tals," stating that immortals did not serve as guides for the dead but were placed in the tomb to illustrate life on Mount Kunlun JË ra Ü4,where the hun SJl (soul) of the deceased traveled on its journey skyward. Martin J. Powers has discussed tech niques for representing immortals' movement across space and their placement in tombs either alongside apotropaic figures or above Confucian sages. He argues that in tombs from Shandong and Northern Jiangsu, the world of immortals is often transformed into a Confucianized paradise.4 Many scholars have noted connec tions between immortals and shamanism in the context of Warring States (475 221 bce) and Han ascension literature, tales of thefangshi Τα it who tried to dupe the First Emperor (reigned 221-10 bce) and Emperor Han Wudi /HiK'Sí (reigned 140-87 bce), and the development of aspects of later religious Daoism.5 Building on the work of these scholars, this paper is the first in English to focus on the repre sentation of immortals on Eastern Han tomb reliefs. It argues that representations of immortals repeatedly stress their liminality and close connection to the animal world, either through their physical bodies, the landscape that surrounds them, or the actions that they perform.

After Zhongguo huaxiang shi quanji, vol. 3 (Jinan: Shandong meishu chubanshe, 2000), fig. 20. 4 The Physical Characteristics of the Immortal Previous iconographical studies have focused on the depiction of immortals as avian hybrids, hypothesizing their origins and distinguishing them from other part-bird and part-human creatures.6 These studies have clarified the iconographi cal genesis of and differences among the images, but they have ignored a number of other significant physical characteristics shared by immortals. Although winged figures dominate the Eastern Han iconography of immortality, some figures are illustrated as reptilian hybrids.7 Many also possess a number of characteristics whose importance has yet to be addressed, including androgyny, long hair, exagger ated nonhuman facial features, tattoo-like markings, and nudity. I call these "sec ondary characteristics" because they may be viewed as extensions of the concept of immortals as avian or reptilian hybrids. Like physical hybridity, these attributes connect immortals to the natural/animal rather than the civilized/human world. I will first investigate the depiction of immortals as avian and reptilian hybrids and then examine how this representation was strengthened by the addition of second ary physical characteristics. This examination will demonstrate that during the Eastern Han dynasty, immortals were believed to be spiritually empowered figures whose physical ambiguities mirrored their marginal existence betwixt and between the realms of heaven and earth. Avian and Serpentine Hybrids During the Eastern Han dynasty, immortals were most often depicted as avian hybrids. Variations exist upon this theme with representations ranging from fig ures with wings protruding from their backs to those with small quills covering the entire body (figs. 1,2). Such feathering is also represented by wispy plume-like clothing that flares out at the elbows and around the knees (fig. 3) or a kind of feath ered headdress. On some figures, the feathers seem to be almost "tattooed" on the immortal (fig. 4).

Line drawing after Changsha Mawangdui y i hao Han mu, vol. 1 (Beijing: Wenwu chunabshe, 1980), fig. 25. was necessary to transcend mortality. Bird imagery took pride of place and a num ber of immortals, such as Wang Ziqiao 3Í1? ít, were said to have turned into birds and flown off to heaven.8 Although the exact origins of this belief are unclear, it was probably based on earlier totemistic or shamanistic traditions; one ancient varia tion of the graph for xian also means to "rise up" or "soar like a bird." Such linguistic associations may suggest some sort of folklore involving a birdlike dance or ecstatic identification with a divine bird.9 Similar cross-cultural associations between the soul and ascension have been noted by Poo Mu-Chou. In ancient Egypt, the Ba soul was shown as a bird with a human head and had the ability to fly and leave the tomb. The ancient Greeks also believed that the souls of the dead were pro vided with wings.10 Avian associations with immortality may also have resonance with descriptions of several groups of people in the Shanhaijing [JLl^Inì (Classics of Mountains and Seas), a geographical encyclopedia completed during the early Han dynasty. These include the Undying People (busi min the Feathered People (yumin ^Βς), and several other groups whose physical characteristics are similar to those of immortals depicted on Eastern Han tombs.11 The visual correlates of this phenomenon first appear on burial goods from Mawangdui JfZEtH Tomb No. 1 (circa 168 bce). The lacquer coffins and the funerary banner from this tomb are the earliest coherent precursors to the East ern Han iconography of immortality and include the representation of a scantily clad immortal depicted with feather-like tufts of hair around his elbows, knees, and other parts of his body (fig. 5). Some of the other creatures on the black lacquer coffin are probably immortals as well. These figures are the first of several probable immortals who appear in tombs on coffins, murals, and banners during the second and first centuries bce.12 The appearance of such figures, although based on much older beliefs, rose to prominence during the reign of Han Wudi, who is famous for his obsession with living forever. During his reign, texts and stories drew associations between birds and immortality. According to Dong Zhongshu ϋίΨΐΙ? (179-104 bce), a scholar at Wudi's court, cranes in particular were thought to have the power of long life.13 LESLIE V. WALLACE</page><page sequence="5">Luán Da one of the many charlatans who promised Wudi immortality, wore feathered clothes and pretended to be an immortal when he received the rank of "General of the Heavenly Way" from an envoy who was similarly dressed.14 The earliest textual source describing immortals as winged creatures is found in the "Yuan You" (The Far-off Journey), a poem from Chuci (Songs of the South) that was probably written around the beginning of the first century bce15: Having heard this precious teaching, I departed, And swiftly prepared to start on my journey. I met the Winged Ones on the Hill of Cinnabar; I tarried in the ancient land of Immortality. In the morning I washed my hair in the Valley of Morning; In the evening I dried myself on the coasts of heaven.16 The text that clearly identifies the winged images on tomb reliefs as immortals was written slightly later by the social critic Wang Chong ΞΕ?ί (27-97 ce): In representing the bodies of genii one gives them a plumage, and their arms are changed into wings with which they poise in the clouds. This means an extension of their lifetime. They are believed not to die for a thou sand years. These pictures are false, for they are not only false reports in the world, but also fancy pictures. However, man in reality does not belong to the class of crickets and moths. In the thirty-five kingdoms beyond the sea there live plumigerous and feathered tribes .. .These people are the produce of their soil, it cannot be said that their bodies were covered with plumage and feathers through the influence of the Tao. Yü and Yi visited His Wang Mu, but she is not reported to have had a plumage and feathers. There are also immortals in foreign countries, but they are not described as having a plumage and feathers, and, conversely, the plumigerous and feathered tribes are not said to be immortals, these attributes can not imply immor tality. How then can it be inferred that the genii must live forever, because they have wings?17 This section from the Lunheng Iraílí (Critical Essays) is the longest passage from an Eastern Han text that both describes contemporary conceptions of immor tals and refers to their visual representations. Although Wang Chong seeks to deny contemporary conceptions of winged immortals and their ascension to immortal ity, he demonstrates just how popular the idea of immortals as avian hybrids had become by the Eastern Han dynasty.

After Zhongguo huaxiangshi quanji, vol. 6 (Jinan: Shandong meishu chubanshe, 2000), fig. 129. Although winged figures were popular on Eastern Han tomb reliefs, immortals were also depicted with serpentine features. In one relief from Shandong, the lower halves of the bodies have two snake-like legs or the single tale of a serpent, and another immortal from Henan has the haunches of a dragon (figs. 6 and 7). The connection between serpents and immortals goes beyond these fused figures, how ever, as immortals are also depicted accompanied by dragons or grasping snakes (figs. 3 and 8). The prevalence of serpentine imagery in the iconography of immortality is related to the Han belief in the power of reptiles to alter their form and their asso ciations with the dao M, described as "now dragon, now snake" in ancient Chi nese texts.18 Although during the Han dynasty snakes were believed to have special transformative and regenerative powers because they shed their skin, a particular mythology surrounded dragons, associating them with rain, clouds, and fertil ity. Dragons were also believed to be the progenitors of several ancient sages and emperors.19 Although there are no textual correlates that described immortals as serpen tine hybrids, an Eastern Han myth did explain that Huangdi Μ"Φ'had ascended to heaven on a dragon, mirroring the frequent depiction of immortals with dragons on tomb reliefs.20 In addition, from as early as the Warring States period, dragons were viewed as vehicles for the soul, and on several funerary banners and tomb murals dating to the Warring States period and the Western Han dynasty the deceased is depicted riding on a dragon. In textual sources the best of examples of hybrid creatures that resemble Eastern Han serpentine immortals are the two sons of Huangdi who appear in the Shan haijing. In this text they are said to stand on several snakes and have human faces with snake-draped ears and the bodies of birds.21 Although in no way an accurate description of later immortals, these and other figures found in the Shanhaijing and on Warring States and Han lacquer and bronze vessels bear witness to a tradition of divine hybrid figures from which Eastern Han artists and patrons could have drawn. Such figures can also be seen on one of the black lacquer coffins from Mawangdui Tomb No. 1, which is decorated with creatures that are pursuing or catching snakes, reminiscent of the later snake-grasping immortal from Shanxi (fig. 8). Another visual antecedent for Eastern Han serpentine hybrids is found on the silk banners recovered from Mawangdui Tomb Nos. 1 and 3 that have been inter preted as depicting the journey of the soul to paradise (fig. 9). Loewe describes the figure at the top of the banner from Mawangdui Tomb No. 1 as Lady Dai, "slough ing off her mortal coil as easily as a snake sheds the skins that he discards."22 John LESLIE V.

Major has explained this figure and a similar figure at the top of the banner from Mawangdui Tomb No. 3 as "the apotheoses of the occupants of the tombs, and their serpentine tails are indicative of their transformation into godlike (or divine ances tor) figures in the celestial realm."23 These figures as well as earlier banners and the snake-grasping figures on the black lacquer coffin from Tomb No. 1 suggest that at least by the Warring States and Western Han periods, snakes and dragons were associated with transformation and the ascension of the soul to heaven. The depiction of immortals as avian and serpentine hybrids was part of a larger tradition in ancient China in which sages, deities, and foreigners were described as anthropomorphic hybrids. In a number of early texts, Huangdi is said to have four faces, four eyes, and the body of a dragon or bear. Fu Xi Üand Nü Wa are also depicted in Eastern Han tombs as human-serpent hybrids. The Xunzi and a number of other ancient texts argue that physical abnormality was a condi tion of sagehood, and in the Shanhaijing there is no end to references of people who are half-man and half-beast. As Mark Edward Lewis has noted, these beliefs were closely tied to the ancient Chinese practice of physiognomy, the idea that the sages responsible for the founding of the Chinese world order were nonhuman progeny, had superhuman status, and were closely linked to nature.24 This argument suggests that immortals were part of a larger group of supernatural beings in ancient China that were viewed as marginal but spiritually empowered figures closely connected to the animal world. Secondary Characteristics Beyond their avian and serpentine features, immortals possessed a number of secondary characteristics that further demarcated and enhanced their liminal sta tus while connecting them to the animal world: androgyny, large ears, long hair, exaggerated nonhuman facial features, tattoo-like markings, and nudity. Many of these traits also appear in visual and textual depictions of foreigners, suggesting a general connection with those living outside the Chinese political, cultural, and spiritual sphere.25 On most reliefs, immortals are depicted as lithe beings whose sex is not clearly defined. This ambiguity is stronger in figures that are more animal than human and 9 Detail of the funerary banner from Mawangdui Tomb No. 1, ca. 168 BCE.

Rather than clearly defining these creatures as female, however, the breasts only seem to heighten their genderless identity. The sexual ambiguity of immortals is stressed in a passage from the Liezi 511 ~F, which is dated to the fourth century ce but is thought to be a compi lation of many passages from earlier texts: Upon the mountains there lives a Divine Man, who inhales the wind and drinks the dew, and does not eat the five grains. His mind is like a bottomless spring, his body is like a virgin's. He knows neither intimacy nor love, yet immortals and sages serve him as minister.26 The representation of immortals as sexually ambiguous beings suggests that their transformative powers were not associated with sexual reproduction. It may be the case that their spiritual powers were considered irreconcilable with normal reproductive capabilities suggested by gender or that these beings were believed to combine the principles of the feminine (yin IH) and the masculine (yang |$H) in their physical form.27 It may also have been believed that once a person had tran scended mortality he or she would no longer be concerned with the sexual desires associated with worldly existence.28 This is the only one of the secondary physical characteristics that does not connect immortals to the animal world but instead expresses their marginal status through sexual ambiguity. In an article about the depiction of barbarians in Han art, Zheng Yan notes that these figures are often placed beside immortals and mythical animals in tombs (fig. 11). In physical terms, he sees the immortals' long ears and flowing hair as visual counterparts to the high noses and deep-set eyes that are characteristic of repre sentations of foreigners in Han tombs (see fig. 4 for long hair and figs. 1-3,6,8,10, 13 16, and 18 for long ears).29 In addition, a tradition claimed Laozi had long ears, which were considered a sign of wisdom.30 Unkempt hair, however, clearly demar cates immortals as separate from the (civilized) world of the living.

Zheng Yan also notes that both foreigners and immortals have "strange non-human faces, and mysteri ous god-like qualities."32 Although it is very difficult to pinpoint an exact facial type, immortals are often depicted with accentuated features such as protruding chins, noses, and large eyes. Two other attributes—which are not noted by Zheng Yan but clearly are associ ated with animals and people who live on or beyond the borders of Chinese civi lization—are tattoo-like markings and nudity (figs. 4 and 10). As Carrie E. Reed has pointed out, in ancient China the tattoo was often cited as the epitome of the practice of many foreign and, in the mind of the Chinese, uncivilized people as it was like the skin of an animal or a water creature.33 Immortals that appear to be naked or at least "clothed" only in their feathers or wispy, feather-like dresses also suggest an identification with the animal world and foreigners, who are often described in textual sources as part-animal or as following customs contrary to Chinese norms.34 A counterpoint to depictions of immortals as naked "wild men" with exagger ated features is found in images where immortals, dressed in garments that con temporary Chinese would have worn at court, are shown worshipping the goddess Xiwangmu or her male counterpart Dongwanggong ϊίΕΞΕίΕι (figs. 1 and 6). These winged, well-dressed figures are found predominantly in tombs from Shandong, sometimes directly above representations of Confucian worthies where, as Powers has argued, the world of immortals has been transformed into a Confucianized paradise. These images bear witness to a growing bureaucratization and seculariza tion of the spirit world that culminated in immortals being shown in successive dynasties as fully human without hybrid characteristics.35 Hybridity, Marginalization, and Spiritual Power Although a thorough visual and textual analysis of hybrid figures in ancient China lies beyond the scope of this paper, my analysis of the physical characteristics of immortals in tomb reliefs points to a common conception of marginalized but spiritually empowered figures. In ancient China, figures who could control certain aspects of nature or the world beyond the grave were often described as part animal and part human. It is clear from the cited examples that both the primary and sec ondary physical attributes of immortals were created from a dichotomy that pos ited the natural (animal) world against the (civilized) world of man and also saw BETWIXT AND BETWEEN</page><page sequence="10">12 Immortals climbing and atop a mountain.

Physical ambiguity established a con nection with the natural world from which immortals, sages, and deities derived some of their power. Hybridity in the case of immortals most clearly referred to their ability to metamorphose, which was the basis of their spiritual power over death and the malignant forces that were believed to lie beyond the grave.36 Hybridity, however, was not always viewed as a positive attribute. This can be seen in the depictions in visual and textual sources that debased foreign peoples and legitimized the established Chinese world order. As Poo Mu-chou noted in his study of the representation of foreigners in ancient China, Egypt, and Mesopo tamia, "others" were often compared with the native self in a culture versus nature dichotomy. Therefore, the state of being "other" was equated with the animal world and foreigners described as acting like animals.37 A very similar rhetoric seems to have operated in terms of the representations of sages, deities, and immortals, but their ability to defy ontological categories was seen in a positive light and as a source of spiritual power. In this sense, immortals gained their power within Han dynasty tombs similar to the ways in which repre sentations of barbarians functioned in tombs during the Tang dynasty (618-906 ce). Marc Samuel Abramson points out that, during the Tang dynasty, "the barbar ians' ambiguity and their transgressive nature as crossers of frontiers and violators of boundaries ... made them potent sources of power and prestige."38 As Zheng Yan has noted, similar motivations were also why foreigners were placed alongside immortals and mythical animals in Han dynasty tombs.39 The danger and insta bility of occupying such an ambiguous position, however, perhaps is made most clear by the gradual loss over time of the hybrid characteristics of sages, deities, and immortals. Although a topic for further research, this suggests that such attributes became increasingly incompatible with the idea of immortality and divinity as the Han dynasty progressed.40 The World of Immortals The physical ambiguity of immortals in Han dynasty tombs was grounded in a tradition that saw such characteristics as indicating both liminality and spiritual power. Similar themes are also stressed in Eastern Han tomb reliefs through the depiction of immortals amid mountainous terrain and swirling cloudscapes or in compositions devoid of landscapes or architectural features. In the following analy sis, I will address the significance of these two trends, arguing that the frequency with which immortals are depicted on or near mountains was based upon Han ideas of immortal paradise and the ancient Chinese conception of mountains as sacred but dangerous realms. At the same time, reliefs devoid of background ele ments show the desire to depict immortals as incessantly mobile beings roaming LESLIE V.

An analysis of both sets of reliefs will demon strate that it is the journey to and not the characteristics of paradise that are stressed in these images. In Eastern Han tomb reliefs, immortals are most commonly represented climb ing treelike mountains or in a stylized landscape that dualistically functions as clouds and undulating hills (figs. 12 and 13). This stylized landscape was an out growth of the fusion of the yunqi cloud motif with elements of mountain imagery popular during the Western Han dynasty (fig. 14)41 and suggests that immortals were believed to inhabit a mountainous world that was also directly associated with the heavens. During the Eastern Han dynasty, these motifs were grounded in the concep tion of mountains as the gate or location of immortal paradise and as a sacred, but perilous wilderness. In Han literature, immortals lived either in the east on the Islands of the Blessed, in the west on Mount Kunlun, or on several of the sacred mountains of China, such as Taishan $|JL| or Huashan ^UÜ.42 Descriptions of these mountains clearly refer to them as an axis-mundi connecting the profane and sacred worlds.

The men who dwell there are all of the race of immortal sages, who fly, too many to be counted, to and from one moun tain to another in a day and a night.43 The Islands of the Blessed figure prominently in stories that highlight the First Emperor and Han Wudi's obsession with becoming immortal and seem to have been popular during the Western Han.

If one mounts to there, one will become a god .. ,44 Kunlun, the Western Paradise where the goddess Xiwangmu dwelled, is fre quently mentioned in other Han texts. By the Eastern Han dynasty, this view of immortal paradise had become the most popular.45 Mountains in ancient China were also conceptualized as divine but treacher ous realms. Although gradually the potentially malignant elements that inhabited mountains were replaced by dead humans who filled official posts in the super natural bureaucracy, originally most beings on mountains were regarded as dan gerous because of their unpredictability, amorality, or supernatural powers. The Shanhaijing describes a number of mountains deities and spirits that are monstrous hybrids46 and must be ritually pacified. In a later text, the Baopuzi JStJt~P (Master Embracing Simplicity), Ge Hong (283-343 ce) eloquently describes the won ders and dangers of mountains: All mountains, whether large or small, have gods and spirits.

When frightened and uneasy, some will see lights and shadows, others will hear strange sounds. Sometimes a huge tree will topple, though there is no wind, or a cliff will collapse for no reason, striking and killing people. Sometimes the man will flee in confusion, tumbling down a cavern or into a gorge; other times he will encounter tigers, wolves, and poisonous insects that attack men. One cannot enter a mountain lightly!47 I argue that both the benevolent and malignant elements of mountain lore are referenced in Eastern Han tomb reliefs that depict immortals amid mountainous terrain. In addition to serving as the gateway or location of the land of immor tality, mountains also suggest the borderlands through which the soul must pass after death. During the Han dynasty, it was believed that the soul would encoun ter many dangers on its journey to paradise, including malignant ghosts, spirits, and ferocious beasts. Wu Hung has argued that these fears were the central motiva tion behind the development of various shamanistic practices in ancient China to guide or protect the soul in its journey.48 Such dangers are related in "Zhao hun" jp Sjt (Summons of the Soul) and "Da Zhao" (Great Summons), poems from the Chuci that describe shamans who work to keep souls from departing or revive corpses. Menaces are also referenced in an inscription on an Eastern Han tomb excavated in Suide m Shaanxi,49 and mountainous terrain would have provided an excellent background for such dangers. The same dual conception of mountains as representing both the land of immortality and the dangerous regions through which the soul would pass can be seen on the "magic mountain" censers (boshan lu Ml J-I'M) that were popular dur ing the Han dynasty (fig. 15). These objects are usually interpreted as representing Penglai or Kunlun, but a number of them are populated with figures whose connection to the theme of immortality is unclear.50 In Eastern Han tomb reliefs such incongruous and potentially noxious ele ments have disappeared. Instead animals are depicted frolicking alongside immortals in cloudscapes, ascending mountainous terrain, or on reliefs where no landscape elements are present (figs. 3,12,13,18). I argue that these compositions BETWIXT AND BETWEEN</page><page sequence="14">depict the dangerous realms between heaven and earth from which hazardous elements have been exorcised. Such scenes suggest the liminality upon which the spiritual power of immortals was based as well as their power to pacify such dangerous regions.51 Beyond mountainous terrain or stylized cloudscapes, however, representa tions of immortals rarely depict land formations, fauna, or architectural features.52 This is noteworthy because immortal paradise and all its wonders were eloquently described in ancient prose, poetry, and ballads. The discrepancy between text and image is partially because in most ancient Chinese representations landscape ele ments are absent. But the primary reason many of these images do not depict the heavenly realm is because immortals are purposely depicted as beings who roam the world between heaven and earth. This incessant mobility is noted in an inscrip tion on a Han dynasty mirror: The Shang-fang made this mirror and truly it is very fine. Upon it are immor tal beings oblivious of old age. When they thirst they drink from springs of jade, when they hunger they feed on jujubes. They roam at large throughout the world, wandering between the four oceans. They rove at will on the well known hills, plucking the Herb of Life.53 In tomb reliefs, the itinerant nature of immortals is suggested by cloud-like formations that become one with the bodies of animals and immortals or, more commonly, in reliefs where the plumage of the immortal conveys a sense of move ment through space. In these reliefs, movement is indicated by the feathers (or cloud forms) that fly away from the immortal's arms and legs in the opposite direction from the forward movement of the body (figs. 2 and 3). This tech nique was based on the Western Han pictorial conventions seen on the black lacquer coffin from Mawangdui Tomb No.l, where movement through time and space is indicated by swirling clouds and the animals and spirits that scamper upward through the composition. Powers has argued that this sense of movement is achieved through the "extension-oriented" structure of individual components within the composition that show how the immortals body parts were created by separate dendritic vectors. According to Eugene Wang, the form of the clouds and animals on the black lacquer coffin express movement across time and space, mapping out the process of rejoining the forces of yin and yang in order to reju venate the deceased.54 The dearth of landscape elements and architectural features in scenes that depict immortals in Eastern Han tomb reliefs, combined with the focus of many on movement through space, indicates that the liminal spatial nature of immortals LESLIE V. WALLACE</page><page sequence="15">and the journey to paradise is emphasized in these compositions. Similar ideas are also stressed in reliefs where immortals are depicted on or approaching mountains, or in stylized cloudscapes that highlight their location between heaven and earth and the pacification of the dangerous realms believed to exist beyond the grave. The Habits of Immortals The physical and spatial liminality of immortals is further stressed by the actions they perform on Eastern Han tomb reliefs, which include: carrying the fungus or elixir of immortality playing game called liubo AM serving Xiwangmu frolicking with various animals riding birds and beasts being pulled in a chariot by birds or animals55 I will discuss the first three individually as they relate to specific aspects of immortality lore and the worship of Xiwangmu and then examine those that deal with animals. The group of reliefs that feature animals, combined with the physical characteristics of immortals and their environment, are essential to understanding the prevalence and function of immortals on Eastern Han tomb reliefs. Carrying the Fungus/Elixir of Immortality One of the most common images found in tombs is of an immortal with its arms outstretched and holding a plant (figs. 2, 7,12,13 and 18). Representations of this flora vary, but it is meant to symbolize the fungus of immortality (lingzhi Wi^L) that, according to ancient Chinese legend, grew on secluded mountains and in the Eastern and Western paradises. Once a person had consumed the fungus, he could become an immortal and ascend to heaven.56 Slightly less common are images of immortals holding round spherical objects (fig. 4). These balls signify the elixir of immortality, after it was pounded by the jade hare and then rolled into balls by the hare's companion, the toad.57 Such procedures for making and ingesting the elixir of immortality are referred to in a Han dynasty ballad: The command comes: "Mortal obey my word! Gather the sacred herb from the tip of the Illusion Tree." A white hare kneels and pounds the herb, a toad makes the pill. I offer up to the throne a jade dish: "Eat this drug, it will make you divine .. ,"58 BETWIXT AND BETWEEN</page><page sequence="16">The recipient of the fungus and therefore the elixir in these images is undoubt edly the deceased whose soul, upon death, could devour them and be transformed and transported to paradise. Playing Liubo Immortals are also depicted on mountaintops or hovering mid-air playing the game liubo (fig. 10). Although most prevalent in Sichuan, such scenes appear in all regions during the Eastern Han dynasty and have been interpreted as the per formance of magic or divination.59 Images of immortals playing liubo may also be linked to the cult of Xiwangmu; members of a mass movement in 3 bce are said to have .. held services and set up gaming boards ... they sang and danced in wor ship of Xiwangmu."60 Yang Lien-sheng has also suggested that in pre-Han and Han times, a number of ambitious mortals sought to defeat deities at liubo in order to obtain magical powers.61 Although the exact ritual or magical implications of this game are unclear, it appears to have had some connection with the immortality cult and ascension to paradise. The Court ofXiwmangmu The only time immortals are not depicted as incessantly mobile creatures is when they are shown at the court of Xiwangmu (figs. 1 and 6). During the Han dynasty, Xiwangmu was a cult figure who was believed to preside over the Western Para dise and direct the production of the elixir of immortality. Based on the model of an earthly imperial court, Eastern Han representations of Xiwangmu's realm bear witness to the growing bureaucratization and secularization of the immortal world. In these reliefs, immortals are usually depicted as supplicants and mem bers of the divine court of Xiwangmu and sometimes welcome the deceased to paradise.62 Images of Immortals and Animals These three motifs—the fungus, liubo, and Xiwangmu—suggest several functions or habits of immortals. Although all three motifs relate to immortality and the development of the immortality cult, the primary function and significance of immortals in the tomb can be found in reliefs in which they are depicted with animals. I have already argued that scenes of immortals frolicking with birds and beasts on treelike mountains or in stylized cloudscapes symbolize the pacification of the dangerous borderlands between heaven and earth. Here, I will focus on reliefs in which animals serve as a vehicle for immortals or pull chariots in which immortals ride as the charioteers (figs. 16 and 17),63 including deer, dragons, tigers, cranes and other birds, turtles, fish, and tianma 3^J§ (heavenly horses).

After Nanyang Han huaxiang shi jingcui (Zhengzhou: Henan meishu chubanshe, 2005), vol. 2, p. 59. Based on these scenes and textual corollaries, I will argue that immortals were placed in tombs because they were believed to act as shaman-like intermediaries between heaven and earth. This combined with their related role as the purveyors of the elixir of immortality was the reason for their popularity during the Eastern Han dynasty. Reliefs that depict animals as mounts or pulling chariots form a compli mentary set of images in which animals are used as spirit vehicles that trans port immortals in their roles as shamanistic mediators between heaven and earth. Shamans and shamanism are concepts that have given way to a variety of inclusive and exclusive interpretations, but shamans usually serve commu nities as intermediaries between the sacred and profane worlds to control the unknown and bring a balance to society as a whole.64 They communicate with spirits on multiple levels, including the worlds above and below and that of man, and are often aided by spirit helpers in the form of animals, whose spe cies vary in different geographic regions.65 According to Siberian shamans, their journeys to various spiritual realms may be used to recover the lost soul of an individual, exorcise spirits that are causing sickness, escort the soul of the dead, and conduct various other spiritual consultations when problems face the community.66 The amount of power that a shaman possesses during séances in which he or she is possessed by or in control of a spirit is a point of debate, but it appears that the degree of control and the exact relationship between the shaman and spirits varies among cultures.67 The exact role of spirit help ers also depends on context; some journey with the shaman to other spiritual planes while others may be sent as envoys to contact or search for spirits in different worlds.68 Although Eastern Han immortals did not perform all the functions of shamans, in reliefs they are depicted as mediators between heaven and earth who guide the souls of the dead through the dark spiritual realms of the afterlife. In many reliefs they perform this task with the help of the above-listed animals, exorcising malig nant forces and transforming the realm between heaven and earth similar to the ways shamans used their spirit-animals to aid journeys through spiritual planes. The utilization of animals as vehicles or spirit mounts is also suggested in an inscription on a mirror from the Han dynasty: BETWIXT AND BETWEEN</page><page sequence="18">ι8 Immortal ascending/descending with various creatures, detail of a pillar from Yinan, Shandong, Eastern Han dynasty. From Zhongguo huaxiangshi quanji, vol. 1 (Jinan: Shandong meishu chubanshe, 2000), fig. 221. If you climb Mount T'ai, you may see immortal beings. They feed on the purest jade, they drink from the springs of manna. They yoke the scaly drag ons to their carriage, they mount the floating clouds. The white tiger leads them ... they ascend straight to heaven.69 The pictorial arrangement of many scenes in which immortals are represented with animals further supports the argument that they were thought of as sha manistic mediators, as they are shown on pillars or walls horizontally ascending or descending or on door lintels or on the boundaries of ceilings traveling across cloudscapes (figs. 3, 6, 11, 12, 13, and 18). In addition, immortals possessed this power because they had ingested the elixir of immortality, similar to the hallucina tory drugs used by shamans in some cultures to achieve union with the spirits and travel through various realms. Several visual and textual precedents link depictions of immortals on Eastern Han tomb reliefs to the wu M (often translated as shaman) tradition of ancient China.70 A number of passages from textual accounts that relate to shamans and shamanistic traditions in ancient China can be connected to images of immortals on Eastern Han tomb reliefs. These passages refer to snakes and snake-handling, shamans that ascend and descend the axis-mundi, the use of birds in shamanistic practices, and the role of shamans and medicine in ancient China. The motif of snake-handling is found on Warring States lacquers (fig. 19) and in Shanhaijng: Shaman Xian is north of Women Chou [nü chou, "second woman"] Moun tain, In his right hand he grasps a blue-green snake, in his left hand he grasps a vermillion snake. He dwells on Dengbao Mountain, where the assembled shamans ascend and descend.71 Snake handling was a common feature among north Asian shamans who were believed to be invulnerable to snakes while they were possessed by a deity.72 This imagery probably served as a precursor for the immortal figure from Shanxi that is shown grasping two snakes (fig. 8) and may be another reason why some immor tals are depicted as serpentine hybrids. The concept of approaching or ascending mountains in tomb reliefs may also draw on the idea of the ascension of shamans via an axis-mundi that is referred to in the above passage. The imagery of winged immortals may be related to figures of costumed danc ers with feathers and winged tails who served as ritual specialists in festival dance performances, a common shamanistic practice in many cultures.73 Birds also play a central role to shamans as spirit helpers in many cultures. Furthermore, in ancient LESLIE V. WALLACE</page><page sequence="19">19 Detail of a lacquer zither showing a shaman grasping two snakes. Changtaiguan Tomb No. 1, Xinyang, Henan, Warring States period. After Teng Rensheng, Chu qiqiyanjiu (Xianggang: Liang mu chubanshe: Taiwan jingxiao Yi yuan shufang, 1991), fig. 73. yA'-Tt 19 Chinese texts, the fangshi, some of whose practices were descended from the wu tradition, were known to analyze bird calls, bird movements, and bird anomalies in order to tell the future.74 As Joseph Needham points out, in the Shanhaijing, the wu are connected with immortals and the immortality cult due to their association with the elixir of immortality and drugs in general. This includes one passage in which six wu carry the elixir in their hands and guard the corpse of Zhayu near Mount Kunlun. In another section, ten wu ascend and descend a sacred mountain gathering elixirs.75 Images of immortals grasping the fungus of immortality or approaching Xiwan gmu's throne with long stalks in their hands may be connected to the practices of male shamans in ancient China; as Chow Tse-tsung notes, the shamans invoked deities by holding young branches of plants or ears of grain.76 These visual and textual corollaries suggest a close connection between immor tals and the wu tradition during the Warring States period and the Han dynasty. Links between shamans and descriptions of immortals also continued after the Eastern Han. In later Daoist texts and imagery, the powers of immortals are often similar to the powers of shamans, including their ability to heal the sick, exorcise demons or beasts, control the weather, tell the future, prevent disasters, use wild animals as helpers, and remain unharmed by the elements. One interesting dif ference between post-Han immortals and shamans is that the immortals usually used their powers as a demonstration of their might rather than for the benefit of mankind.77 This does not appear to be the case in depictions of immortals in Eastern Han tombs, which were thought to aid individuals, if not the society at large. This change in the conception of immortals from selfless beings that facili tated the ascension of the living and the dead to self-centered individuals may have had its beginnings in the secularization of the immortal realm during the East ern Han dynasty Such a change, combined with modifications of the immortals' physical characteristics, suggests that although Daoist immortals are based on Han dynasty texts and images, ideas relating to them as well as the process of becoming one had evolved by the time the first immortal hagiography was compiled in the third century ce.78 By that time, the winged creatures that guided the soul of the deceased during the Eastern Han dynasty had been forgotten and were left to haunt the tombs they decorated, replaced by a growing pantheon of Daoist figures and associated beliefs. BETWIXT AND BETWEEN</page><page sequence="20">Metamorphosis, Postmortem Immortality, and the Afterlife in Han China In Eastern Han tomb reliefs, images of immortals stress their ability to transcend the mortal world by depicting hybrid figures acting as shaman-like mediators between heaven and earth. Although it is clear that some sort of bodily transformation was necessary to become an immortal, exactly how this occurred after death is unclear. From textual and visual sources it appears three coexistent views of immortality were prevalent in Eastern Han China: 1) longevity in the present world, 2) the pos sibility of escaping death all together, and 3) achieving immortality after one died. Such a threefold division, however, cannot be seen on tomb reliefs. These kinds of immortality could be achieved by a number of methods, and as Livia Kohn has pointed out: During the Han dynasty philosophy, longevity concerns, and shamanism were joined into one complex, also incorporating cosmological, astrologi cal, and medical theories. At this time, transcendence was primarily under stood as a mechanical process: one received the divine materials from the immortals already residing in paradise, then transformed them for human use in ritual procedure, applied them to oneself and thus could become immortal.79 One Han dynasty ballad tells of an acolyte receiving the fungus of immortality and reverting to a youthful appearance but never mentions the hybrid winged or serpentine creatures that decorate tomb reliefs: The fairy riding a white deer, Has short hair and ears so long, As he leads me up Great Mount Hua, He grasps the mushroom, seizes red-fringe fungus. When we reach the Masters gates, He offers up the drug in a jade casket. The Master eats the drug, His body in a day grows strong and fit, His white hair turns black again, His lifespan lengthens, his years are increased.80 It is also important to note that this passage is speaking of longevity, not the hope that some part of the soul would survive and ascend to heaven. Such concepts, however, grew increasingly blurred during the Han dynasty.81 This study has sug LESLIE V.

After Wang Sili, "Shandong Feicheng Han huaxiang shi mu diaocha," Wenwu, no. 4 (1958), p. 36. 20 gested that images of immortals were placed in the tomb to facilitate similar pro cesses after death. Based on texts and images, however, it is unclear whether the deceased returned to a youthful state or became an empowered hybrid humanoid like those repre sented in tomb reliefs. The possibility of actually being transformed into a bird like figure may be suggested by an image from Feicheng flEíS, Shandong, where it appears that a pair of wings were added to the central standing figure, who probably represents the deceased (fig. 20).82 It may have been that both ideas coexisted and were not mutually exclusive or the process may have been different depending on the individual. During the Han dynasty, the contradiction inherent in burial and the belief in the possibility of immortality after death was explained by stories that told of individuals who seemed to die a regular death, were buried like everyone else, and then ascended to immortality. In 110 bce, Han Wudi was surprised to discover that there was a tomb for Huangdi, who was believed to have ascended to heaven. His advisors explained that the tomb housed only Huangdi s hat and robe.83 Wang Chong in the Lunheng also discussed the belief in contrived death, calling it "deliverance from the corpse" (shijie a concept that would become central to later religious Daoism.85 For a time, the cult of immortality and the hybrid figures in Eastern Han tombs held the keys to eternal bliss. The idea of immortals and an immortal paradise offered an alternative conception of the afterlife that coexisted with the belief in a bleak underworld whose bureaucracy mimicked that of the living and the view that the deceased would become an ancestor who needed to be annually pacified and cared for through sacrifices.86 It is not clear how such ideas were synthesized in Han dynasty China, if at all, but individuals who became immortals could escape the desolate underworld and may also have been believed to become ancestors. The benefit was twofold, providing a pleasant afterlife while also promising prosperity to the living, as a happy ancestor was believed to be a helpful ancestor.87 Despite such initial incongruities, it seems that in all three conceptions of the afterlife one of the most important things was that the dead be separated from the living.

Price (London and New York: Routledge, 2001 ), pp. 123-34. 28 It is unclear if or how the androgynous depiction of immortals in Eastern Han dynasty tomb reliefs relates to the tradition of sexual techniques for achieving immortality. The earliest texts that describe sexual practices intended to lengthen life have been excavated from Warring States Period sites in Yan and Qi associated with thefangshi.

Hayashi has also suggested that losing one's hair was equated with losing one's life or vitality; hence immortals were depicted with long, flowing hair.

Pow ers has also discussed how the represen tations of the gathering of beasts that often include immortals in Eastern Han tomb reliefs are similar to descriptions of the paradisiacal "Plain of Riches" in the Shanhaijing and the social and natural harmony of an ideal Confucian world described in a poem by Cai Yong ίΐϋ (132-192 ce).

As Powers notes, such pictorial conventions were purposely abandoned in the depictions of some immortals in the Shandong-Jiangsu region in favor of an analytical subdivi sion of the figure common in "classical" reliefs in this area. See Art and Political Expression, pp. 117-21. 55 Immortals also occur in two other scenes. In one scene, they perch atop roofs alongside phoenixes or other birds signifying the prosperity and good fortune of the household. Such scenes do not directly relate to the immortality of the soul after death or the immortality cult. Immortals also appear in a number of reliefs worshiping a stupa-like image. For the conflation of the Buddha and certain aspects of Buddhism with the immortality cult, see Wu Hung, "Buddhist Elements in Early Chinese Art (2nd and 3rd Centuries AD)," Artibus Asiae 47, nos. 3-4 (1986), pp. 263-352. 56 For more on the fungus of immortality, see Powers, Art and Political Expression, pp. 77-78, and "A Late Western Han Tomb Near Yangzhou and Related Problems," pp. 287-88. Shih Hsio-yen, in "Han Stone Reliefs from Shensi," also discusses the decoration of a "symbolic plant" that most likely refers to the litigzhi in reliefs from Shaanxi. In several scenes immortals and other figures approach Xiwangmu carrying long stalks or shish-kebab-looking objects. Such objects should not be confused with the fungus of immortality that immortals frequently carry in tomb reliefs. Instead, as Wu Hung has noted, these objects are identified by a passage in the Han Shu ÌM β (History of the Han Dynasty) that describes a mass religious movement surrounding the goddess in 3 bce in which stalks of straw or hemp were used by worshippers.

For shamanism andiate Chu religion, see Major, "Late Chu Religion," pp. 135-39. Michael Puett, in To Become a God, argues against the existence of shamanism in ancient Chinese religion, specifically refuting claims that religion was based primarily on shamanistic practices and the traditional reading of the Child's spirit journeys as shamanistic. Based on visual evidence, I would have to disagree with Puett's general conclusions because representations of immortals as well as a number of figures that predate the Eastern Han dynasty strongly suggest the existence of a religious system that had shamanistic elements. Munakata has noted that, "the immortality... cult started as an intellectual twist on shamanism, an ingenious transfiguration of the idea of the shamans ecstatic cosmic trip into the image of the free-flying mountain man (xianren) and further, that of the "achieved man" (zhenren), who attained a cosmic vision and life freed from earthly bounds of space and time." Munakata, Sacred Mountains, p. 11. Suzanne Cahill has also observed that Xiwangmu, who in tomb reliefs is accompanied by immortals, in both the Shanhijing and Chu ci is described as a shamanistic deity further connecting the immortality cult to shamanistic traditions.
