<plain_text><page sequence="1">REFLECTIONS ON THE PROBLEM OF TIME IN RELATION TO NEUROPHYSIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY ADRIAN C. MOULYN, M.D. 1. Argument. In a previous paper it was suggested that specific concepts are needed in the psychological sciences and the basic mental triad was described as a useful tool to further our understanding of mentation (1). It was stated that the sensori-motor reflex principle cannot describe and explain mental phenomena, because the reflex is basically a mechanistic occurrence, while mental phenomena differ in essence from mechanisms. Since conditioned reflexes can be conceived as sensori-motor reflexes with another, non-mechanistic factor superimposed, similarities and contrasts between reflexes and conditioned reflexes were taken as the material from which one can develop new thoughts about mentation. Reflex shutting of the eyelid, caused by direct contact between cornea and a small, invisible foreign body was compared with and contrasted to shutting the eye before a large, visible object thrusting toward the eye. It was shown that reflexes occur in response to a stimulus after the stimulus has been applied, while con- ditioned reflexes seem to anticipate the stimulus. This was taken as evidence that conditioned reflexes have a protensive character, have a relationship to the future, which sensori-motor reflexes lack. This difference in time relationship was developed into the statement that the difference between mechanisms and mental phenomena lies in their different relationship to the future. The need for specific concepts to describe mental phenomena stems from the inability of the reflex principle to deal with the protensive tendency of mental phenomena and to fill this need the concept of the basic mental triad was offered. This principle con- sists of three interdependent, interwoven phases: the triad connects with the past through condensation of some of the subject's past experience into a vaguely formed conglomerate; it connects with the future by projecting the condensed past into the future; the central phase of the triad is the act within the present instant, where a synthesis of past, present and future is accomplished. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the temporal structure of the basic mental triad. This analysis may afford a foundation on which one can erect con- cepts pertinent to mentation and independent from, though integrated with the basic concepts of the natural sciences. In the search for such independent con- cepts the writer feels encouraged by the warning of an historian: ". . for us to be on our guard against the error of applying to historical thought, which is the study of living creatures, a scientific method devised for the study of inanimate nature" (2). The differences between the methods of the natural sciences and the historical sciences has been thoroughly described by Heinrich Rickert (3). Since biology and psychology and particularly psychiatry are dealing with living creatures, it might be profitable to investigate whether the methods of the biological and the psychological sciences are adequate to deal with their specific material. Instead of following Rickert's formal approach to the problem, one can develop, in a 33</page><page sequence="2">34 ADRIAN C. MOULYN more specific manner, the contrast between the sciences which deal with inert matter and the sciences which deal with living organisms. I hope to bring out this contrast through an analysis of the temporal structure of phenomena dis- played by living organisms and the temporal structure of phenomena observed i inert matter. Besides philosophical speculations about the essence of time, there are two sciences which have devoted much thought to the problem of time, i.e., physics and experimental psychology. The physicists have investigated the problem of time measuring, which centers around the question how to determine the simul- taneity of events. The experimental psychologist measures the temporal aspect of human or animal behavior with appropriate instruments, but in so doing he foregoes inner subjective experience as a source of knowledge about time. How can one tap this source? There are two avenues of approach: First, through the analysis of movement; second, through introspection. The analysis of movement will bring out the contrast that exists between movements of inert bodies and movements of living organisms, which contrast can be anchored upon objectively observable phenomena. From these two types of motion will be developed two forms of time, physical time and psychological time. Our inner experience, our "Erlebnis," which accompanies the movements of our body can be studied through introspection; and on the basis of this introspective experience, one can develop these two time forms from a subjective standpoint. 2. Two Modalities of Movement. The analysis of the contrast between move- ments of inert bodies and movements of living organisms can be based on the observation of three flying objects, near a steep hill on a windy day: bits of paper being whisked over the top of the hill and out of sight, gulls majestically floating in gliding flight above the crest of the hill and a flying kite. Let us compare then, motion of inert bodies, with motion of living organisms, with motion of a man- made machine. The pattern of movement of the pieces of paper is caused by the movements of air currents, which movements are determined by movements of molecules. According to the kinetic molecular theory the surface of the piece of paper is bombarded by air molecules, which, through the impact of their combined forces cause the movement that we observe. The interchange of forces between air molecules and paper is conceived in analogy to the interchange of forces between ideally rigid bodies. The transmission of movement from one elastic body to another elastic body takes a certain amount of time, but the exchange of forces between ideally rigid bodies must take place in an instant which has no duration. The temporal structure of the exchange of forces between rigid bodies is the relationship of the before and after. The temporal relationship between cause and effect is also that of before and after. A presently observed effect is due to its cause which was an actuality during an infinitesimally small instant of time, the cause sinking back into the past as it gives way in the present to the emergence of its effect. The presently observed effect becomes a cause during a present instant without duration, realizing a subsequent effect. The present instant without duration, which separates cause from effect in</page><page sequence="3">TIME IN RELATION TO NEUROPHYSIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY 35 the before and after relationship, is the basic condition for an important further development of natural scientific thinking. Classical mechanics conceives the universe as a network of cause and effect where rigid, spherical bodies collide with one another in a geometric point in space and in a punctiform instant in time. Under these conditions there is an exact balance between the amount of energy lost by one body and the amount of energy gained by another body, which balance is expressed in the law of conservation of energy. This law, in turn, is an elaboration on the causal principle, which in its original form states nothing more than that any phenomenon is the effect of a cause, but which re- lationship is further developed into the statement that cause and effect are quan- titatively equal: causa equat effectum. The causal principle gives rise to the causal equation (4), the most basic principle of the natural sciences. The causal equation applies to rigid bodies which exchange energy in a punctiform instant without duration. Therefore, the punctiform instant is one of the concepts on which the causal equation is based and it must needs be one of the cornerstones of the natural sciences. The causal equation and the punctiform instant render important services to the natural sciences. Just as we can deduce backward in time that an observed fact must have its cause and that effect must equal cause, just so can we cal- culate forward in time that whatever will become observable in the future must be equal to what has been observed in the past. The tremendous accomplish- ments of modern physics consist essentially in mathematically accurate predic- tion of the future course of events, on which prediction depends the application of natural scientific theory in practical life, both in war and in peace. The causal equation and its pivoting point, the punctiform instant, makes the accurate, quantitative prediction of the course of physical events possible. The writer is well aware that this conclusion seems to by-pass the existence of modern statistical mechanics and the time-space continuum of Einstein- Minkowski and that this approach based on the concepts of classical mechanics is open to criticism (5). Yet I feel that the difference between motion of inert bodies and movements of living organisms can be adequately brought out in re- lief on the basis of the most formal concepts of classical mechanics, i.e., the causal equation and the punctiform instant. The question which I wish to raise is, whether the concept of physical time is an adequate time form in which we con- ceive the movement of living organisms? To raise this question and to attempt a solution, this analysis was undertaken. If we now look at our second example, the gliding flight of the gulls, we can describe this phenomenon in two fashions: first, we can regard the body of the bird as if it were nothing but an inert body which resists forces of air currents; secondly, we can describe the bird's flight in terms of neurophysiological theories. Here again, one runs the risk of oversimplification, but unless the discussion is kept on a formal level, looking at the broad lines and disregarding some of the details (which details are precisely what interests the practicing scientist) the process of laying bare the fundamental structure of neurophysiological thinking will be clogged by detail. Disregarding the various levels-cord, cerebellar,</page><page sequence="4">36 ADRIAN C. MOULYN thalamic, cerebral-on which reflex processes actually take place and conse- quently overemphasizing the spinal level of the reflex process, the physiological description of the flight of the bird runs somewhat as follows: Air currents push the left wing, say, upward; tension increases in the muscle tendon apparatus of that wing and this increase in tension is transmitted as a sensory stimulus to spinal motor centers. Simultaneously the slight clockwise rotation of the bird's body, due to the pressure of air current on wing, causes a state of excitation in the vestibular apparatus, which stimulus is also transmitted centralward. Numerous impulses coming in from the periphery converge on the higher nervous centers, where processes of excitation and inhibition sift and organize these states of dis- turbance. After the various sensory stimuli have been organized in the higher centers, a motor impulse is sent out to the pectoral muscle of the right wing which is lowered a bit and which movement counteracts the upward push of the air current against the left wing. Consequently, the body of the bird rotates counter clockwise along its longitudinal axis overcoming the rotation caused by the air current. The neurophysiological description of the gliding flight is a mechanistic ex- planation because it is based on the concept of the sensori-motor reflex. The temporal structure of events taking place along the reflex path is that of pre- ceding events determining present events, regardless of whether the arc consists of the minimum of two neurones, or whether it involves thousands of neurones. Since neurophysiology is based on the concept of the sensori-motor reflex princi- ple, the causal principle and physical time must be the most general principles with which it operates. The natural sciences dealing with inert matter have ex- panded the principle of causality into the causal equation. On the surface it seems as if the causal equation does not hold for nervous phenomena because the same stimulus does not always cause the same effect; to the contrary, an identical stimulus may cause a quite opposite effect than it did the first time it was applied, or again, it may not bring about any motor effect at all. This leaves a discrepancy between the amount of energy coming into the central nervous system in the form of sensori stimuli and the amount of energy leaving it as motor impulses, which is at variance with the law of conservation of energy. If neurophysiology were built solely on the classical concept of the simple, mechanistic sensori-motor reflex arc, this discipline could not claim to be one of the natural sciences because the law of conservation of energy would not hold for nervous phenomena. The reflex theory had to be expanded by a superstruc- ture of other concepts among which excitation and inhibition are the most im- portant. These principles account for the discrepancies between amounts of energy which come into the nervous system and the amounts of energy which leave it. Therefore, neurophysiology is in consonance with the law of conserva- tion of energy. Expressed in more formal terms, this means that the causal equa- tion applies to neurophysiology since the law of conservation of energy is a specific case of the causal equation which is the most basic concept of natural science. The conclusion that neurophysiology rests ultimately on the causal equation</page><page sequence="5">TIME IN RELATION TO NEUROPHYSIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY 37 has an important bearing on our discussion of the time problem. With the causal equation neurophysiology rests of necessity on the form of physical time with its punctiform present instant. Punctiform instant and causal equation place this science securely in the fold of the natural sciences. Consequently, neurophysio- logical explanations of movements of living organisms are mechanistic explana- tions. The question arises does neurophysiology adequately explain the differ- ences between movements of living organisms and motion of inert matter? The most striking difference between these two modes of movement, as our examples show, is that the paper is whisked away by the air currents while the gulls remain floating on top of the crest of the wave. I wish to go further and venture that an inert body which will remain on top of the crest of the wave is inconceivable, simply because an inert body would "fall off" the crest of the wave. The problem then is how the bird remains on top of the wave. And can neurophysiology explain this fact? This implies the question: Is neurophysiology really based on mechanistic principles only, or does it inject concepts of another nature into its elaboration of the reflex theory, concepts which do not fit into the structure of a mechanistic natural science? It is well worth our while to stir up the problems which are lurking underneath the surface. In order to get at the principle which is unwittingly ingrained in neurological thinking (which principle differs in essence from such concepts as reflex arc, inhibition, excitation) let us turn to our third example, the flying kite. The kite is an inert object and a center of acting and reacting mechanical forces. The difference between this inert object and other inert objects like flying bits of paper is that the papers move with the air currents while the kite resists the air currents. A certain action-reaction pattern exists between papers and air currents. The papers make air currents "visible" to the observer, very much like invisible particles moving in a Wilson cloud chamber leave visible tracks in their wake. The pattern of movement of the pieces of paper is determined by the pat- tern of movement of the air currents. The movement of the kite, which approxi- mates zero in reference to a terrestrial coordinate system, can be described as a pattern of acting and reacting forces very much as the movements of the pieces of paper can be described as such a pattern. However, man has injected a new element, different from mechanical forces, into the pattern of forces of which the kite is the center. One can readily eliminate this element by cutting the cord which attaches the kite to the earth because now the kite is nothing more than a bit of paper, frisked away by the wind. The new element which man has in- jected into the pattern of acting and reacting forces in constructing the kite is foresight. When we construct a kite we use our knowledge of mechanical forces and we mold these forces into a pattern, which pattern we do not observe in the forces governing motion of inert matter. The inventor of the kite used his past experience about mechanical forces as a basis from which he projected into the future the occurrence of events which had never been observed before. He con- ceives a dynamic whole during a short present moment when he molds his past experience into a new pattern and projects this past experience into the future. After the moment of creation has been- consummated, the inventor predicts that</page><page sequence="6">38 ADRIAN C. MOULYN the newly organized pattern of forces will repeat itself identically and indefi- nitely in the near and far future. Thus, out of the conception of a dynamic whole during one short present moment the inventor develops a static whole. One easily loses sight of the dynamic component in the static machine because the present moment during which the machine was invented is short and will never return, while the result of the invention is a useful object, lasting indefinitely into the future. As Yakovlev (6) says with characteristic verve: "In man, the motility of effectuation reached its crowning point in the individuation of such 'spear- head' movements of hands and digits through which man not only uses matter as a tool, but shapes and fits that matter into a tool." Man accomplishes this re- patterning of forces because he has imagination; he projects into the future that which is not yet and which has never before beepi actual experience of the ex- ternal world. In short, he channels the forces of inert matter into new patterns because he has foresight. The flying kite is evidence of human foresight. It is quite conceivable to con- struct an electronically controlled machine, imitating the gliding flight of birds, which will remain for some time on top of the wave of air currents; yet, such a machine is not merely an inert body because foresight is incorporated in it. By the same token, the ffight of the gull proves that the living organism can rear- range mechanical forces in patterns which are never observed in the pattern of interaction of forces operative in inert matter. Living organisms show evidence of foresight while inert matter does not. Physiological theories have to account for this attribute which differentiates living organisms from inert matter. In- stead of attributing foresight to the living organism as a whole, neurophysiology attributes foresight to the central nervous system, which is a part of the total organism. Not the gull channels forces into a typical pattern resulting in gliding flight, but the nervous system of the bird channels these forces. How does neuro- physiology conceive this process of organization and is this conception truly mechanistically grounded? The central nervous system has been compared with man-made machines since the time of Descartes. The father of the reflex theory "had been impressed by the fountains in the royal gardens which were so constructed that, actuated by water, clay figures moved, made sounds, and played instruments. He conceived the animal body to be actuated on the same principle; instead of pipes and water there are nerves and animal spirits" (7). After we learned that the peripheral nerves are not hollow tubes but solid fibres and that electrical phenomena are important aspects of nervous activity, the classical comparison has been modified to suit modern tastes. For didactic purposes we compare the central nervous system with a complicated telephone system, but there is more to these com- parisons than superficial analogy. This is what Pavlov (8) says on the subject: "My residence may be connected directly with the laboratory by a private line and I may call up the laboratory whenever it pleases me to do so; or on the other hand, a connection may have to be made through the central exchange.... In the one case the communicating wire is always complete, in the other case a small addition must be made to the wire at the central exchange. We have a similar</page><page sequence="7">TIME IN RELATION TO NEUROPHYSIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY 39 state of affairs in reflex action. The path of the inborn reflex is already com- pleted at birth; but the path of the signalizing reflex has still to be completed in the higher nervous centers." These and similar comparisons are more than con- venient textbook schemata. They indicate the trend of neurological thought, which is a trend to operate exclusively with mechanistic principles and which trend seriously backfires. We have seen that machines are not mechanisms in the sense that forces ob- served in inert matter are mechanisms. The telephone is a reality because years ago inventors sweated and worked on a problem, which was nothing but a thought projected into the future. The direct telephone line is just as much the reifica- tion of man's purpose-striving as the more complex, indirect communication, where a human subject is interpolated between mechanical forces at all times. Now, if we take attributes of man-made machines and if we project these at- tributes onto the central nervous system, our thinking turns neatly around in a circle over several sectors: (1) We project our purpose onto inert matter, for in- stance by constructing a telephone; (2) The dynamic purpose-striving is buried in the static machine and (3) We forget that purpose was injected into the pat- tern of mechanical forces and we forget this so thoroughly that we believe move- ments of machines are comparable to movements of inert bodies; (4) We com- pare the central nervous system with a telephone system and conclude that the nervous system can be understood on mechanistic principles; (5) So we conclude that the movements of living organisms are nothing but mechanisms; (6) The last step in this circular reasoning is that purpose is a superfluous concept in neurophysiology. The theme of this argument is: Purpose defrauded, and the scientific results: Unclarity about the basic concepts describing and explaining human and animal behavior. Pavlov is one of the protagonists of the trend to eliminate purpose from neu- rophysiology, treating this concept as if it were a hostile and foreign concept. The reason behind the mechanist's aversion to the concept purpose is a funda- mental one and lies much deeper than one could suspect from an analysis of the reflex concept and related neurophysiological concepts. The concept purpose is foreign to natural scientific thinking because the temporal structure of purpose- striving activities will not fit into the scheme of before and after separated by the punct4orm instant. In order to effectively challenge the mechanistic position in neurophysiology, one has to prove that certain biological phenomena cannot be understood adequately if they are conceived as occurring in the form of physical time. By developing another time form, different from physical time, one can show that purpose is an obligatory concept in neurophysiology. This time forim can be developed on the basis of the analysis of movement of living organlisms and this time form can establish the concept purpose as a concept in its own right within the sciences dealing with living organisms. Instead of battling with the elusive concept purpose, one should carefully integrate this concept with our knowledge of living organisms gained through mechanistic natural scientific methods. This integration of causality and teleology leads inevitably to anthropomorphizing since we compare movements of animals</page><page sequence="8">40 ADRIAN C. MOULYN with our own movements and we project some of our own attributes onto ani- mals. This anthropomorphic standpoint causes the mechanistically inclined neurophysiologist to shy away from the concept of purpose although he himself uses it in his comparisons. It is important to analyze anthropomorphic thinking step by step in order to look at its foundations and to know its limitations. The first step in this trend is that we attribute foresight to some of our movements. The second step is the observation of analogies between our own movements and movements of other living organisms. Because of this analogy, we attribute foresight to some move- ments of some animals and therefore, we identify more or less with animals. This identification with the observed object is the core of anthropomorphic thinking. One might ask whether this identification and projection are scientific attitudes. This question points up the schism between the sciences dealing with inert matter and the sciences dealing with living organisms. Purpose has been banned from the natural sciences since Galilei, which was justified, because one should not identify himself with inert matter in natural science. The mechanistic trend in biology and particularly in behavioristic psychology is to ban purpose from these sciences, following the example of the natural sciences; but this trend, the writer believes, prevents understanding the living organism as a whole. Physiology and neurophysiology study limited aspects of the organism conceived as mechanisms, and they get along quite all right with the concepts of the mechanistic natural sciences, including the causal equation and physical time. But if we view the organism as a whole, as a totality, then we need the concept purpose. Purpose is needed in biology if we try to study living organisms as a whole because living organisms perform movements whicb have a specific temporal structure vastly different from the temporal structure of the movement of inert bodies. To get a clear picture of movements of animals we have to study our own movements, which study leads away from objective observation of facts to the attitude of introspection of our subjective, internal states. In the following sec- tion I shall focus on our inner experience, our "Erlebnis," of movement under conditions commonplace to modern man. 3. Two Forms of Time. To differentiate between two forms of time, I have chosen examples which, from the objective side, are nearly identical but, from the subjective side, there is a marked difference in the inner experience accom- panying these situations. To bring out this subjective contrast in objectively similar situations, let us analyze our inner state, first, when we drive a car over a strange road and second, when driving over a well-known road. Driving over a road for the first time takes much effort, while one drives in quasi automatic fashion after one knows the landmarks. Why does one feel so differently and how does this difference in feeling come about? Suppose one drives from H(ome) to D(estination), passing the road signs SI, S2, ... Sn. On the first trip one sets out to accomplish the task H to S1 as a unit. Si is a point of secondary destination where one slows down or actually stops to see where one goes from there. Sl is not only a point of termination of move- ment but also a point of departure where one embarks on the next stretch, SI</page><page sequence="9">TIME IN RELATION TO NEUROPHYSIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY 41 to S2. The task H to D is accomplished by aligning separate stretches in the temporal order of before and after, by juxtaposition in time. One experiences this movement as angular, saccaded, interrupted and tiresome. But now one begins to know the road; one does not stop and start any longer, nor does one slow down and accelerate when coming to the road signs. The angularity of movement becomes smoothed out and, at the same time, the signs begin to take on a different meaning: SI used to break up stretch H to S2 into two parts, but now, after one has grown to know the road, one knows what is beyond SI and remembers at the same time what has gone before. The meaning of SI has changed because instead of a point where movement was interrupted it has become a point where movement is connected because now it connects past movement "H to SI" with future movement "Si to S2." First one expe- riences the driving over the unknown road as an interrupted sequence juxtaposed in time since one went from sign to sign; now, one connects present with past and future as one goes through the signs. Introspection shows that we perform in the first instance with effort and in the second case with ease. This difference in internal states is related to the experience of time. In angular motion, when we do one thing after another in succession, time is experienced as the before and after, but after we have learned to perform an activity smoothly, a past activity is integrated with a future activity within a present activity and this is the experience of the past and the future inter- penetrating within the present. The experience of movement contains, in paral- lel, the experience of time. The above examples show that movement may be accompanied by two different types of internal states which can be related to two different ways of experiencing time. These two time experiences can be ex- pressed in the concepts of physical time, or: the before and after separated by the punctiform instant; and psychological time, or: integration of past and future within the present. Psychological time has three aspects. It takes up a stretch of duration in the present, and it infiltrates on either side into the past and into the future. Clay (9) has suggested the term "specious present" for a time form which is "de- lusively given as present," inferring that a present instant which has duration is an illusion. The specious present therefore, does not differ from the punctiform instant of physical time and is inadequate as a psychological time form. William James (10) describes the specious present as "no knife-edge, but a saddle-back with a certain breadth of its own, on which we sit perched, and from which we look in two directions of time." He calls these forward and backward looking ends "the fringes" of the specious present, which is a singularly appropriate designation for the vague connections between the present instant, past and future. In order to cast aside all doubt whether the present instant of psycho- logical time has duration, I suggest the term "precious present." The precious present is a stretch of time which has duration in the present and which has attributes of pastness and futurity in its past and its future fringes. The outstanding difference between physical time and the precious present is that the former is continuous while the latter is discontinuous. Physical time</page><page sequence="10">42 ADRIAN C. MOULYN "streams" continuously from the before to the after, past and future being un- limited quantities, corelated to the motion of inert matter which, presumably, has always existed in the past and which will in all probability always continue in the future. But the precious present tries to describe the discontinuous ex- istence of a human subject in time. Because physical time is a continuum, it can be measured with the aid of clocks while the discontinuous precious present can- not be measured. Bergson (11) says that "Time, conceived in the form of an un- limited and homogeneous medium, is nothing but the phantom of space by which the reflective conscience is obsessed." One should not attempt more than to very vaguely estimate the duration of a precious present as sometimes lasting a second, sometimes a few minutes, sometimes possibly an hour or so. Instead of enumerating the differences between physical time and precious present, let us see to what use one can put these time forms. The precious present is the specific time form of the basic mental triad. The act, or the central com- ponent of the triad, takes place in the present instant with duration while con- densation of the past fits into the past fringe and projection into the future fits into the future fringe. Just as physical time is appropriate for the causal equa- tion, just so is the precious present specific for the basic mental triad. Precious present and triad can clarify three areas: (1) The differentiation be- tween motion of inert and of living matter; (2) The process of learning; (3) The understanding of internal states. 1. The differentiation between movement of inert matter and of living organisms derives from their relations to the future. The future course of movement of inert matter can be mathematically predicted because the causal equation ap- plies. The causal equation applies because movement of inert bodies termi- nates in the punctiform present instant and does not project into the future. This statement appears to be annulled by the fact that natural science can pre- dict the future movements of inert bodies quantitatively. But prediction of the future differs in essence from projection into the future. Prediction of the future is possible because for the natural scientific conception of reality there is no difference between past and future since the future only continues what has al- ready happened in the past. Introspection reveals that we experience the future as unknown and unpredictable which attributes are eliminated in natural science by means of the punctiform instant and the causal equation. The differentiation: psychological time versus physical time can help to under- stand the living organism. Some movements of living organisms occur in physical time while other movements occur in both physical and psychological time. Metabolic processes, respiratory movement, heart action and also nervous ac- tivities occur in physical time and they can be conceived as independent from the organism as a totality (12). These phenomena are mechanisms and they can- not yield the totality of the organism. The total organism cannot be reconstructed from the mechanistic phenomena studied in the laboratory through natural scientific concepts, because "totality" is not a natural scientific concept. The totality of the living organism consists in its development, its becoming, in time, when it creates new connections between past and future in a precious present,</page><page sequence="11">TIME IN RELATION TO NEUROPHYSIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY 43 connections which only living organisms can achieve. Human beings experience these connections as a reality while they act or decide, when they perform vol- untary movements, i.e., when the basic mental triad functions in a precious present. Movement of inert matter occurs in space and in physical time, movements of living organisms occur in space and in physical time, but in addition, in psy- chological time insofar as they connect past with future within the present. One time form suffices to describe motion of inert matter while two time forms are needed to understand motility of living organisms. 2. Learning. Learning is: integrating precious present with physical time. Three phases can be distinguised in this process of integration: (1) During the first phase one performs one partial activity and then the next partial activity, juxtaposed in succession in time, until the total activity has been accomplished; (2) During the second phase, which is very short, one synthesizes in a present activity a past with a future activity; (3) During the last phase one performs that activity semi-automatically with reflex like precision. Let me illustrate these statements with the example given above. When one goes over a road for the first time, one drives from sign to sign, one is uncertain about his future and relies on an informant's past experience, or on a map, which is the past experience of a whole group of people. One is tied to his own past and to the past experience of others, and one cannot yet project his activity into the future. This being past-bound and blind to the future arouses emotional tension which may increase to apprehension. This emotional tension causes the feeling of fatigue after we perform an activity by juxtaposing one partial activity after another partial activity in succession. The juxtaposition of partial activities is the experience of the before and after, going from present instant to present in- stant without penetrating the future in the fringe. During the second phase of learning one suddenly becomes aware of a new meaning of the road signs as connecting points between past and future stretches of road within the present moment. Kurt Goldstein illustrates the instantaneous aspect of learning as follows: "We continue to make non-purposeful movements of our body, i.e., movements which are determined by details which are non- essential to bicycle riding, until we are suddenly able to maintain our equilibrium and to move ourselves correctly" (13). During the second phase of learning one lives in psychological time, lifted out of the stream of the before and after; one condenses past experience and projects an act into the future. This moment of mastering the activity is the unfolding of the basic mental triad in a precious present. The triad releases us from being past-bound and opens a window to the future. This release from past experience is a transition from living, mostly, in physical time, to a living, mostly, in psychological time. This is neither disregard nor elimination of the past; to the contrary, the basic mental triad resynthesizes past experience condensed with future projected. The third phase of learning sees us sailing effortless over the now well-known road. We drive through the signs and perform the task "H" to D in one stroke without angularity because we know at each point where we came from and what</page><page sequence="12">44 ADRIAN C. MOULYN lies ahead in the future. The angles have been smoothed over because the triad has been built into the juxtaposition of before and after during the second phase of learning. The before and after of physical time has not been eliminated, but the triad has added a new element in extending the dual time relationship of the before and after to the triplicate time relationship of the precious present. One now seems to drive automatically. This is the very reason why neurophysiol- ogists think that learned movements can be described as a stimulus response relationship, that learned activities are reflex like in nature. However, we know from introspection that the first phase of learning is accompanied by emotional tension of varying intensity and that a learned activity assumes an entirely different emotional coloring. I shall now attempt to show why mechanistic theories of behavior cannot explain these differences in emotional state. 3. Inner state and precious present. The emotional tension which one experiences during the first trip over an unknown road is due to the discrepancy between future-striving and past-boundness and causes fatigue. During the second phase the basic mental triad suddenly casts new connections between past, present and future in a precious present, the subject can look into the future immediately ahead; there is a change from past-preponderance in the before-after relation- ship to future-striving in the precious present. The tension of the first phase is suddenly released as the subject gains power over the future and he may feel emotionally satisfied to exuberant, depending on the task he had undertaken. Archimedes and his Eureka is the classical story of this second phase of learning and its release of emotional tension. During the third phase of leaming there is again a change in emotional tone since after the elation of the second phase there is now a feeling of confidence, of assurance. Now the individual is no longer blind to the future after the triad has released him from past-boundness and allows him to project his activity into the future fringe. Can mechanistic theories of behavior explain this gamut of emotions which the learning human being has to traverse? I believe these theories must fail in this respect because they conceive all movements of living organisms as occurring in physical time. The goal of these theories is to predict human and animal be- havior as accurately as the natural sciences predict the course of future events in the realm of inert matter. Movement of inert matter is not purposeful and occurs without emotion; because occurring in space and in physical time, it is possible to equate past with future which eliminates the contrast between known past and unknown future. This contrast is the very basis of the feeling tone which accompanies our movements. Natural scientific methods eliminate this contrast and with this contrast emotion is eliminated. The punctiform instant and the causal equation make accurate prediction of the future possible, but at the same time, these concepts cannot show how purpose-striving, living human beings project themselves into the future. The precious present and the basic mental triad describe how living beings reach out into the future by projection into the future fringe. Paul Weiss stresses the importance of future striving as follows: "Each being has a concern, a way of reaching from the concrete present into the abstract future. Its concern enables it to lay hold of the future in an individual way" (14).</page><page sequence="13">TIME IN RELATION TO NEUROPHYSIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY 45 The interdependence of movement, learning and emotion can be shown through the triad and the precious present. If living organisms existed in physical time, one could not understand their movements which are more than juxtaposition in succession since these movements integrate past with future movement in the present; nor could one understand how living organisms learn, because from a natural scientific standpoint no truly new connections are made; and one could not understand how they emote because if the future were quantitatively know- able, emotion would be a farce and a delusion, an unnecessary byproduct of movement. The basic mental triad unfolding in a precious present describes how an individual connects past with future, how he learns to make new connections and that emotion must be an integral component of living as inner tension toward the future. The triad and the precious present are concepts derived from introspective experience of oneself as a whole. Observation of other individuals as wholes is possible only over the detour of identification and subsequent projection. Identi- fication and projection are necessarily the basis of all biological studies of living organisms insofar as they constitute wholes. As an illustration I like to mention an experiment by Yerkes, who placed an earthworm in a T-tube, the exit end of which was provided with a piece of sandpaper and a chemical stimulus was placed immediately behind the sandpaper. He asked himself the following ques- tion: "Can it (the earthworm) 'associate' the tactual with the chemical stimulus and acquire the habit of regularly responding to the sandpaper as though it anticipated the effect of the salt" (15). The investigator projects human func- tions of association and anticipation of the future upon the lowly earthworm, which partial and critical identification was justified by the result of the experi- ment. Such an experimental setup is based on the supposition, foreign to the- natural sciences, that new connections will be made by the experimental subject under identical external conditions. The formation of such new connections can only be understood if we explicitly conceive biological individuals as purpose- striving beings. One should not use the concept purpose as a subterfuge for the incompleteness of causal explanations. These will always remain unfinished; because after the cause for a phenomenon has been unearthed, one immediately regards this cause as the effect of a further remote, still unknown cause and so on. On the other hand, no matter how complete they may become, causal explanations will never reach into the sphere of the teleological because from this viewpoint phenomena interpenetrate within a precious present, which has aspects of pastness, present- ness and futurity. The before and after relationship of the causal principle does not transform into the interpenetrating, triplicate structure of the precious present. One can take two opposite attitudes toward living organisms: One either ex- amines mechanistic part-functions such as heart action, respiration, reflex ac- tivities, which have the temporal structure of the before and after relationship separated in the punctiform instant; or, one looks at the organism as a whole as it connects past with future in the present. Both attitudes coexist and inter- mingle in actual scientific biological thinking which is one of the reasons why</page><page sequence="14">46 ADRIAN C. MOULYN biologists and psychologists are in discord about the concept purpose. These two attitudes are not limited to biological thinking but they are related to divergent and contrasting attitudes which man takes toward reality, toward life in general. 4. Two Attitudes toward Reality. The dichotomy between physical time and precious present runs parallel to the contrast between two divergent attitudes we assume toward reality. Either we take a quantitative attitude, or, we act. The quantitative attitude is the establishment of relations of quantitative iden- tity between things. Most of our waking life we deal with objects in a quanti- tative manner as we seek to obtain food, clothing and shelter. The quantitative methods of the natural sciences have grown from this practical attitude through the refinement of concepts and of measuring techniques. The causal principle which dictates our activities in daily life is expressed as the causal equation and instead of using rhythmic movement of our body, particularly the pulse beat, to measure time, we use clocks. With the aid of the causal equation, the punctiform instant and clocks, natural scientific quantitification overcomes the threat of the unpredictable future. We master the future with tools and with scientific methods. In contrast to the quantitative attitude, the act is a wholly different orienta- tion toward reality. We work with objects most of the time, measuring them in space and in physical time. Occasionally we lower the barriers of the objective world around us, and we lose ourselves in the vague subjective world of the pre- cious present when we act. Here we do not know the future quantitatively and concretely. Instead of solving the problem of the unknown future through cal- culation, man asserts himself in the face of the awareness of the unknown quali- ities of the future. He can penetrate the future immediately lying ahead with his acts, when the basic mental triad functions within a precious present, pro- jecting his act into the future fringe, uniting past condensed in the past fringe with future projected in the future fringe. The meaning of the future in the fringe differs vastly from the future in physical time since the former is unknown and unpredictable the latter quantitatively identical with the past. After the act is completed, the unifying attitude submerges again and there is a shift to the quantitative attitude which again comes to the fore: the results of the act are crystallized out of the fluidity of experience in a precious present, which is a crystallization in terms of space and physical time. We return from vaguely formed, subjective regions to the well delimited, measurable, objective world of daily life and of the natural sciences. This shift in attitude toward reality has its collateral in the expression of the precious present in three-dimensional space. The precious present loses its triplicate structure in this process of spa- tialization: the present instant with duration is reduced to the durationlesspuncti- form instant; the fringes expand to past unlimited and future unlimited. The triplicate structure of the precious present is transformed into the duplicate structure of physical time by "a kind of refraction of pure duration through space" (16). The distinction between physical time and precious present is obscured due to physical time overlaying, as it were, the precious present, just like the quanti-</page><page sequence="15">TIME IN RELATION TO NEUROPHYSIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY 47 tative attitude overshadows the act. Therefore, it is more correct to say that we live "nearest to," or, "mostly in" either time form since in actual experience we are always aware of both time forms simultaneously, though either one may predominate. We prefer the quantitative attitude not only because it allows us to predict the future, but also because it is the basis of our procurement of use- ful articles for our continued existence. However, normal human beings do not deal with reality exclusively through the quantitative attitude. Normal man lives dynamically fluctuating between act in precious present and quantitative attitude in physical time. Act and quantitative attitude can be mutually delimited by comparing the attitudes of Western man and of Indian Hindus toward life. Activity is most desirable to the Westerner, but to the Hindu contemplation and total inactivity is the highest good, as one can glean from the Brahman proverb: "It is better to sit than to walk, to lie down than to sit, to sleep than to wake and death is best of all" (17). Certain Hindu mystics cover the entire body, except the nos- trils, with sand; forcing themselves to remain immobile, undisturbed by impres- sions from the outside world. They escape from the objective world and cling to subjective, inner experience thereby cutting off all desire to go out into the ex- ternal world. Mystic withdrawal has its counterpart in an extreme attitude of Western man in the machine age: Always on the go from one machine to another he is forever scurrying about to get more and more objects. Machine man crowds the sub- jective, inner experience in the precious present out of his consciousness because he is submerged in the spatial, measurable world in physical time, he cannot lift himself out of the stream of the before and after, and consequently, he can- not accomplish the act in the precious present. Either extreme attitude without being complemented by the opposite attitude could not exist in their respective civilizations: the mystic, lost in his subjectivity parasitizes on the quantitative attitude of his followers who get food for him, while the man of exclusive action in his quantitative attitude uses machines which scientists and inventors have conceived during past precious moments. Normal mental life, Western and Oriental alike, shifts continuously between these two extremes. The basic mental triad is the spark plug which sets a train of quantitative thought and action in motion since the experience in the precious present strives for expression. No discoverer, scientist, artist, religious founder, wants to keep his inner experience to himself; but he wants to share this experience with his fellowmen, and he wants to express his non-quantitative experience in deeds, in words, in scientific facts and theories, mathematical formulae, works of art. Man is driven to express his subjective experience in terms of the objective, spatial, measurable world in physical time. The two basic attitudes toward reality reverberate in the biologist's approach toward living organisms. This approach is dominated by the quantitative at- titude since the physiological experiment and the psychological test situation are not conducted on the total organism but on a residue which remains after part of the organism has been removed. Even the dog in the Pavlov frame whose</page><page sequence="16">48 ADRIAN C. MOULYN nervous system is intact is not a total organism because the external world is almost entirely removed and the dog cannot communicate (18) with the world about him. In psychological testing one deals with an individual in a highly ab- stract manner and leads the communication between subject and world into narrow channels. One cannot reconstruct the totality of the original organism with the test results as building stones because the experimental subject is hardly a purpose-striving totality but only a unity of part-functions in the temporal succession of before and after in physical time. Actually, this reconstruction falls back on pre-scientific experience and attitudes. Long before the physiologist or the psychologist became a scientist he was aware of his own body and its re- lations to the external world. He has looked at and played with animals, identi- fying himself with them and projecting some of the vague ideas he had formed about his own organism onto theirs. Much later in life we project our own at- tributes onto the part-functions and the mechanistic phenomena which we un- cover in total, purpose-striving living organisms. In other words, we assume that mechanisms are purpose-striving entities, contrary to the definition of what a mechanism is. Because identification and projection are inevitable and essential aspects of the biologist's attitude toward the living organism, there is a core of subjective material even in the most objective data of neurology and psychology. The pro- jection of human attributes, not on the total organism, but on the central nervous system hides this subjective material from view and keeps purpose out of the descriptive concepts of neurology and psychology. One hopes to reconstruct the totality of the experimental subject as more and more, mechanistically con- ceived, part-functions become known. Because these part-functions are pre- dictable in their course in physical time, one hopes to become able to predict human and animal behavior as accurately as the natural sciences predict move- ments of inert matter. The successful prediction of the course of many of these mechanistic part-functions, carved out of the total organism, fortifies some biol- ogists in their conviction that the biological sciences should and can operate with concepts similar to those of the mechanistic natural sciences, in particular with the causal equation and physical time. However, in quest of the mechanistic understanding of living organisms one has sidestepped the problem of the totality of the organism. The idea of totality cannot be understood through the causal equation and physical time, but is derived through abstraction from our most immediately given experience of our own totality as living, striving human beings (19). The common sense, pre-scientific idea of totality can be developed into a scien- tific concept with the aid of the principles of the basic mental triad and the pre- cious present. These principles are helpful in constructing and developing the concept totality in biology, in contradistinction to mechanistic principles of the natural sciences. The physiologist, the psychologist, and, most of all, the psy- chiatrist should keep in mind that they are dealing with total organisms which cannot be understood through quantitative mechanistic methods. We identify to a greater or lesser extent with living organisms and we project all or some of</page><page sequence="17">TIME IN RELATION TO NEUROPHYSIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY 49 our own attributes upon them, precisely because they are totalities. Identification and projection are justified scientific procedures because living organisms are totalities similar to our own totality. The two contrasting attitudes which man can assume toward reality give rise to differences in scientific methods. The quantitative attitude develops into mechanistic methods which are adequate for our understanding of movement of inert matter and also, with certain limitations, to our understanding of mechanis- tic phenomena observed in living organisms. The act is the primordial, subjective experience of our own totality and gives rise to the biological concept of totality. Reflections on the problem of time are essential to our understanding of living organisms as purpose-striving totalities, therefore, the precious present and the basic mental triad are useful in differentiating the mechanistic sciences from the biological sciences.
