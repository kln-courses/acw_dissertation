Arthur, John, and Shaw, William H., editors. Readings in Philosophy of Law. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1984. $27.95. Including both important historical writings and controversial contemporary essays, this textbook anthology addresses such topics as the nature of law, theories of punishment, the con- cept of responsibility, and the relationship be- tween law and society. Among the many authors represented are Ronald Dworkin, John Hart Ely, Lon L. Fuller, H. L. A. Hart, and Robert Nozick. Bavidge, Michael. "Gross Depravity and Moral Seriousness." Journal of Applied Philos- ophy 1(1) (1984), 53-61 [M. Bavidge, Depart- ment of Adult Education, University of New- castle upon Tyne, Newcastle NE1 7RV, Eng- land ]. Through a discussion of the concepts of de- sire and punishment, Bavidge argues that the grossly depraved criminal can be considered less than a normally responsible agent. He therefore concludes that key moral categories, such as the notion of guilt, cannot be applied to such individuals. Beauchamp, Tom L., and McCullough, Law- rence B. Medical Ethics: The Moral Respon- sibilities of Physicians. Englewood Cliffs: Pren- tice-Hall, 1984. $10.95 paper. This volume in the Occupational Ethics Series presents the foundations of moral reason- ing and models of moral responsibility for doc- tors in their effort to promote the best interest of their patients. The authors use case studies to inform debates about decisions not to treat, ster- ilization, truth-telling, paternalism, autonomy, competence, and obligations to third parties. Board of Trustees, Committee on Medicole- gal Problems, American Medical Association. "Insanity Defense in Criminal Trials and Limi- tation of Psychiatric Testimony." Journal of the American Medical Association 251(22) (June 8, 1984), 2967-81 [*Division of Medicolegal Af- fairs, Office of the General Counsel, American Medical Association, 535 N. Dearborn St., Chi- cago, IL 60610]. The Board of Trustees of the American Med- ical Association recommends the replacement of the insanity defense with a mechanism that will allow a defendant to be acquitted if a cer- tain mental disease or defect deprived the de- fendant of the required state of mind (mens rea) to avoid performing an offense. Recommenda- tions concerning the commitment and release of those charged under mens rea provisions are also forwarded. Accompanying this article are two comments from members of the American Bar Association and the American Psychiatric Association. Breggin, Peter Roger. Psychiatric Drugs: Hazards to the Brain. New York: Springer, 1983. $29.95. Breggin presents evidence that the major tranquilizers, antidepressants, and lithium pro- duce irreversible damage to the brain. He ex- amines the ethical, legal, and political implica- tions of psychiatric drugging. Caplan, Arthur L., and Jennings, Bruce, ed- itors. Darwin, Marx, and Freud: Their Influence on Moral Theory. New York: Plenum Press, 1984. $25.00. The ninth volume in the Hastings Center Series in Ethics, this book is a collection of nine original essays that address the contributions of Darwin, Marx, and Freud to moral theory.

Coleman, a psychiatrist, declares psychiatry to be an art and not a science that affords special expertise to determine competence for trial, as- sess past motives, or predict dangerous behav- ior. He calls for the abolition of the legal power granted to psychiatrists by society and the state. Davis, Nancy. "Abortion and Self-De- fense." Philosophy and Public Affairs 13(3) (Summer 1984), 175-207 [N. Davis, Depart- ment of Philosophy, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720]. Davis distinguishes three views of the moral- ity of abortion: the moderate view, that abortion is often morally defensible whether or not preg- nancy poses a threat to the pregnant woman's life; the restrictive view, that abortion is mor- ally defensible only when pregnancy threatens the woman's life; and the permissive view, that abortion is usually morally defensible. She claims that the restrictive position (and to a lesser extent, the moderate view), are weakened by an appeal to the woman's right of self-de- fense, an appeal she believes cannot be ade- quately argued. Donaldson, Thomas, and Werhane, Patricia H., editors. Ethical Issues in Business: A Philo- sophical Approach. Englewood Cliffs: Pren- tice-Hall, 1983. $19.95 paper. Using the case study method, this updated anthology investigates ethical problems from a philosophical standpoint. Issues include ethical relativism, self-interest, truthtelling, corporate responsibility, profit motive, distributive jus- tice, employee rights, affirmative action, and the environment. Feinberg, Joel. "The Moral and Legal Re- sponsibility of the Bad Samaritan." Criminal Justice Ethics 3(1) (Winter/Spring 1984), 56-69 [J. Feinberg, Professor of Philosophy, Univer- sity of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721]. Feinberg claims that arguments finding bad samaritan laws morally illegitimate in principle are flawed. His discussion of the "enforced be- nevolence argument" centers on five mistaken views of samaritan interventions: (1) as "mere" conferrals of benefits; (2) as gratuitous favors; (3) as fulfillments of the general imperfect duty to be charitable; (4) as performances of a spe- cific duty towards this person, but one without a correlative right in the beneficiary; and (5) as acts of supererogation. He also discusses the "line-drawing argument," and the argument from the superior strength of negative to posi- tive duties. Flynn, Eileen P. Human Fertilization In Vitro: A Catholic Moral Perspective. Lanham, MD: Uni- versity Press of America, 1984. $22.50; $11.25 paper. In applying contemporary Catholic theology to the technique of in vitro fertilization, Flynn concludes that the procedure may be morally justifiable when utilized by sterile married spouses who are attempting to achieve biolog- ical parenthood. Gutmann, Amy, and Thompson, Dennis, editors. Ethics and Politics: Cases and Com- ments Chicago: Nelson-Hall, 1984. $13.95 pa- per. This textbook examines the morally ques- tionable means used in the political process (e.g., deception, or official disobedience) and the problems of determining the goals of public policy (e.g., distributive justice, equal opportu- nity, or liberty). The editors use a range of cases, each followed by a comment and each group concluding with recommended reading. Haan, Norma; Bellah, Robert N.; Rabinow, Paul; and Sullivan, William M., editors. Social Science as Moral Inquiry. New York: Columbia University Press, 1983. $40.00; $12.00 paper. A 1980 multidisciplinary conference at the University of California at Berkeley on the place of morality in social science resulted in the sixteen essays in this volume. Sections focus on how specific disciplines deal with their ethical dimensions; value issues and philosophi- cal problems relating to all social science; and an examination of value-free positivist social science and of alternative ways to explore the relation between social science and social life. Hampton, Jean. "The Moral Education The- ory of Punishment." Philosophy and Public Af- fairs 13(3) (Summer 1984), 208-38 [J. Hampton, Department of Philosophy, University of Cal- ifornia at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024]. The author attempts to develop a complete justification of the moral education theory of punishment that accepts certain aspects of the deterrence, retributivist, and rehabilitation views, but departs from them in important ways. By concentrating on the educative char- The Hastings Center 55</page><page sequence="2">acter of. punishment, the author concludes that "[W]rong occasions punishment not because pain deserves pain, but because evil deserves correction."

Kuhse, Helga. "A Modern Myth. That Let- ting Die is Not the Intentional Causation of Death: Some Reflections on the Trial and Ac- quittal of Dr. Leonard Arthur." Journal of Ap- plied Philosophy 1(1) (1984), 21-38 [H. Kuhse, Centre for Human Bioethics, Monash Univer- sity, Clayton, Victoria 3168, Australia]. Using as a backdrop the acquittal of Dr. Leonard Arthur, a pediatrician accused of at- tempting to murder a Down syndrome baby by not feeding it, Kuhse discusses the "Sanctity of Life Ideal" and its relationship to the intentional causation of death. She argues that direct killing and indirect killings and lettings die represent the intentional causation of death, which is an infringement of the law and the Sanctity of Life Ideal, and calls for a reevaluation of the moral and legal principles that have created the er- roneous distinction between killing and letting die.

Workers at Risk: Voices from the Workplace. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984. $20.00. Rather than add to the burgeoning statistical literature on risk assessment, the authors have interviewed seventy-five workers in an effort to understand their attitudes toward their jobs, their health, and the risks they face working with chemicals. The interviews highlight the impact social, political, and economic condi- tions have upon the perception of risk and one's adaptation to it, and capture the ambiguous po- sition of chemical workers who are simulta- neously aware of the dangers of their trade and the necessity of employment. Paul, Ellen Frankel, editor. Social Philosophy and Policy 1(1) (Autumn 1983), [*Journals De- pUrtment, Basil Blackwell Publisher Ltd., 108 Cowley Road, Oxford OX41JF, England]. $40.00/year, institutions; $14.50/year, individ- uals; $8.00 single issues.

Youngner, Stuart J., et. al. "Patients' Atti- tudes Toward Hospital Ethics Commiltees." Law, Medicine, and Health Care 12(1) (February 1984), 21-25 [S.J. Youngner, Center for the Critically III, University Hospitals, 2065 Ade- Ibert Road, Cleveland, OH 44106]. The authors interviewed 120 outpatients from three different hospital units at a large, urban, teaching hospital. Survey questions included: "Do you think such committees could be use- ful?"; "Who should be able to ask the commit- tee to review a case?"; and "Who should serve on ethics committees?" Most respondents agreed that ethics committees could serve a use- ful advisory role, though most were unaware of the existence of such a committee at their hospi- tal. Zaner, Richard M. "A Criticism of Moral Conservatism's View of In Vitro Fertilization and Embryo Transfer." Perspectives in Biology and Medicine 27(2) (Winter 1984) 201-12 [R.M. Zaner, Professor of Medical Ethics, Depart- ment of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232]. Zaner attacks the conservative view of in vitro fertilization (IVT) and embryo transfer (ET) expounded by Tiefel and Kass. He argues that potential damage to IVT/ET offspring is no greater than it would be for other offspring; that the issue of consent from potential offspring is irrelevant; and that assigning a morally priv- ileged status to the fetus at some point in its development is arbitrary. He concludes that moral conservatism on these issues is un- necessarily dogmatic, and supported by neither fact nor theory. Zimmerman, Burke K. Biofuture: Confronting the Genetic Era. New York: Plenum, 1984. $16.95. Zimmerman discusses the history and the state of the art of genetic engineering and re- lated matters in molecular biology. He urges so- ciety to understand the new biotechnology and its monumental implications for the future of civilization. Zinberg, Norman E. Drug, Set and Setting: The Basis for Controlled Intoxicant Use. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1984. $22.50. From his five-year study on drug use, Zin- berg concluded that drugs can be used without being abused, depending on the drug itself; the user's values, attitude, and personality; and the physical and social setting. He argues that the social setting is the primary moderator of the controlled uses of intoxicants. Mama Howarth and Eric Feldman The Hastings Center Report, October 1984 56</page></plain_text>
