<plain_text><page sequence="1">French Studies THE ROMANTIC ERA By John Whittaker, University of Nottingham i. General P. Laforgue, 'Machinisme et industrialisme, ou romantisme, moder nite et melancolie', RHLF, 103:63-92, suggests that the industrial development which brought machinery to the attention of writers such as Balzac, Hugo, and Vigny, produced by its effect on their imagination a new and more complex kind of Romantic melancholy which contrasted with the simple unease which was fashionable in the early years of the Romantic era. The proceedings of the two conferences held by the Societe des etudes romantiques in January 2002 and 2003 are published in the same journal: J.-L. Diaz, 'Quelle histoire litteraire? Perspectives d'un dix-neuviemiste', ib., 515-35, introduces the theme, 'Multiple histoire litteraire', and identifies a number of areas in which there is a good deal of work to be done in order to achieve a better understanding of Romanticism; A. Compag non, 'Philologie et archeologie', ib., 537-42, gives an overview of the changing approaches to igth-c. literary history during the last 40 years, representing a renewal of interest and of critical techniques; P. Laforgue, 'Histoire litteraire, histoire de la litterature et sociocri tique: quelle historicite pour quelle histoire?', ib., 543-67, considers the different points of contact between literature and history, and concludes in favour of a sociocritical perspective; A. Vaillant, 'Pour une histoire de la communication litteraire', ib., 549-62, calls for a revolution in the procedures involved in literary history, and suggests a move to the study of large corpora, for example the detailed analysis of a year of Girardin's La Presse, in order to elaborate a poetic history of the form and genre of literary communication; P. Regnier, 'Litterature, ideologies et ideologic de la litterature: un combat toujours actuel', ib., 563-78, notes that the study of literature was essentially a igth-c. invention, observing however that a better term is needed for the type of analysis which is now involved, perhaps 'litteraturologie'; E. Bordas, 'Stylistique et histoire litteraire', ib., 587-89, shows the igth-c. origins of the modern concept of stylistics; S. Michaud, 'L'exception allemande, ou quelques questions au naturalisme europeen', ib., 591-96, notes that the perspective of both French Romanticism and French Naturalism changes radically when one compares them with their German and British counterparts; J.-Y. Mollier, 'Histoire culturelle et histoire litteraire', ib., 597-612, suggests that the association of literary and cultural history is fertile territory for development, and gives a number of glimpses of</page><page sequence="2">The Romantic Era potentially fascinating subjects of study in the Romantic era; J. Lyon Caen, 'Histoire litteraire et histoire de la lecture', ib., 613-23, shows the close relationship between the evolution of the reading public and the development of the novel in the years 1830-40 and beyond; M.-E. Therenty, Tour une histoire litteraire de la presse au XIXe siecle', ib., 625-35, calls for further study of igth-c. newspaper and periodical production, observing the impact of the press upon literature; J.-P. Bertrand, Tour une histoire des poetiques (impromptu)', ib., 637-42, calls for a closer association between the study of the literary history which is external to a text and the study of its inner structure and function, the two being by no means incompatible; V. Laisney, 'Choses dites: petite histoire litteraire de la parole au XIXe siecle', ib., 643-53, shows that, though the 19th c. did not favour the spoken word as a form of literary output, a good number of writers of our period left traces of their conversations in the notes and stenographic records made by others, and that these are worthy of our attention; C. Plante, 'La place des femmes dans l'histoire litteraire: annexe ou point de depart d'une relecture critique?', ib., 655-68, finds that the increasing number of women writers, particularly in the first half of the 19th c, was a reflection of the changing role of women in society, observing however that their work has tended to be given comparatively little attention in literary histories. S. Moussa, 'Mehemet-Ali au miroir des voyageurs francais en Egypte', Romantisme, 120:15-25, examines the various portraits of the viceroy by French writers from 1805 to 1848, finding that his image is an interesting combination of civilization and barbarism, the emphasis depending on the individual author. J.-L. Diaz, 'Quand le maitre devient chef d'ecole . . .', ib., 122:7-17, examines a significant igth-c. phenomenon in the socialization of hierarchic relationships between writers as they grouped themselves into 'schools'. Napoleon, Stendhal et les romantiques: Varmee, la guerre, la gloire, ed. Michel Arrous, Saint-Pierre-du-Mont, Euredit, 2002, 465 pp., con tains the proceedings of the conference held, with the assistance of the Societe internationale d'etudes stendhaliennes and the Revue Internationale d'etudes stendhaliennes, at the Musee de l'Armee in Nov ember 2001.

Arrous, 'Presentation, "Vive Waterloo!", de quelques enjeux de la gloire au regard de l'histoire et de la litterature' (9-19), explaining the intention of the conference to bring together historians and literary scholars in order to combine their areas of expertise; T. Ozwald, 'Le Napoleon de Balzac: une si tenebreuse affaire' (23-37), suggesting that B.'s interest was in anthropological rather than in military history, and that he was therefore inclined to transpose facts and modify events; V. Laisney,</page><page sequence="3">164 French Studies 'La Napoleone de Charles Nodier, ou l'exaltation romantique sous le Consulat' (39-53), on the satirical ode directed towards the First Consul, published in 1802 and for which, having denounced himself to the police, Nodier was imprisoned; P.-M.

Yon, 'Les militaires dans l'oeuvre d'Offenbach: conventions et subversions' (135-68), observ ing that the first and the last time that O.'s music was played in the theatre during his lifetime was in connection with military plays, noting their importance in his musical career, and his ability to subvert conventions in order to discredit the army; N. Boussard, 'L'odieux de la paix, l'apologie de la guerre et la nostalgie de la gloire selon Stendhal' (169-93), identifying what S. disliked about war, namely the periods of inactivity during campaigns and the disorder, though also drawing attention to his nostalgia for military activity once peace had returned; G. Bodinier, 'Le courage, la gloire et l'honneur vus par les officiers et les soldats de l'armee du Premier Empire' (197-219), taking evidence from the official documents dealing with N.'s campaigns; M.

Guerin, 'L'ambition ou la gloire en deuil' (237-63), showing how the literary aesthetics of military glory underwent a transformation between 1830 and 1848; X. Bourdenet, '"Le Saint-Bernard, n'est-ce que ca?": Pepisode du Saint-Bernard dans La Vie de Henry BrularcP (265-90), indicating the connection in Stendhal's mind between the Grand Saint-Bernard and N., perhaps as a result of David's painting of 1801, yet stressing N.'s absence from this episode; J. Gamier, 'L'historiogra phie militaire de la bataille de Waterloo et son influence sur Stendhal et Hugo' (291-302), comparing the Waterloo episodes in La Chartreuse de Parme and in Les Miserables with the historical data available, and showing how S. and H. exploited it. The remaining papers are not relevant to our period.</page><page sequence="4">The Romantic Era La Vie romantique. Hommage a Loic Chotard, ed. Andre Guyaux and Sophie Marchal, Univ. Paris-Sorbonne, 592 pp., contains the pro ceedings of a conference held in June 2000 in memory of the young expert on Romanticism who died an untimely death. It includes: S.

Berthier, cHenri de Marsay: le Rolla balzacien' (37-47), observing the similarities between the character in La Fille aux yeux d'or and the one in Musset's poem, though finding that de Marsay is different on account of the role which Balzac intends for him, and the two probably derive from a common Romantic conception; T. Bodin, 'Vigny et les Affaires de la Chancellerie' (49-71), presenting a number of documents which Chotard had brought to light concerning Lydia Bunbury's inherit ance, and which give a refreshing view of the poet's thinking; F.

Dufour, 'Portraits du prochain siecle: un recueil de portraits litteraires en 1894' (191-204), showing that the idea of the collection owed something to Sainte-Beuve, though the procedure involved was somewhat different; C. Gaviglio-Faivre d'Arcier, A la recherche d'une collection perdue. La bibliotheque musicale de LovenjouP (205-20), reminding us of L.'s other interest and the mention in his will of a music library, which now seems to have been lost, though initial research into its existence produces promising results; S.

Morin, 'Lamartine a cheval' (373-88), on the horses in L.'s life and what he wrote about them; S. Moussa, Julia dans Le Voyage en Orient de Lamartine' (389-97), showing that L.'s descriptions of his daughter and the account of her death are used for essentially literary purposes; G. Peltre, 'Theodore Chasseriau et "les poetes de ces derniers temps'" (399-408)^ on the painter's declared interest in poetry; R.

Ecrire la peinture entre XVIIIe et XIXe siecles, ed. Pascale Auraix Jonchiere, Clermont-Ferrand, Univ. Blaise Pascal, 492 pp., contains the proceedings of a conference held by the Centre de Recherches Revolutionnaires et Romantiques at the Universite Blaise Pascal in October 2001. It covers a rather broader field than the French literature of our period, and there are papers relevant to the 18th c, to German Romanticism, to the later 19th c. and to the history of art. The following are included: A. Lascar, 'Eugene Sue romancier: la tentation picturale' (187-202), showing that S.'s realism was clearly inspired, though at a certain distance, by paintings; P. Berthier, 'Balzac portraitiste: position picturale du probleme' (231-40), observ ing that B.'s use of painting is less a matter of ekphrasis than an appeal to the reader's ability to create images; M. Brix, 'Frenhofer et les chefs-d'oeuvre qui restent inconnus' (241-52), suggesting that Le Chef-d'oeuvre inconnu prefigured the aesthetics of Mallarme, also a major preoccupation of 20th-c. art; L. Giraud, 'Stendhal, biographe de Leonard de Vinci' (253-64), showing that the Histoire de la peinture en Italie follows a particular biographical methodology which S. had developed; N. Wanlin, 'Esthetique picturale et nostalgie: la disparition de la peinture dans Gaspardde laNuit d'Aloysius Bertrand' (295-310), exploring the links between visual imagery and an interest in the Middle Ages by means of the painters and paintings mentioned; T.

Surlapierre, 'Le systeme du reel et les strategies de l'egotisme dans Duprincipe de Vart et de sa destination sociale de Pierre Joseph Proudhon' (323-40), on a work which is a combination of different genres linking the history of art and the history of ideas; M. Gine-Janer, 'Discours et peinture dans Les Ames du Purgatoire de Merimee' (341-53), suggesting that the novella is based on an imaginary picture; C. Matossian, 'Michelet et Gericault: l'agence ment du monde' (417-31), giving particular attention to M.'s lecture of 12 February 1846 at the College de France; P. Auraix-Jonchere, 'Ekphrasis et mythologie dans La Toison d'or de Theophile Gautier (1839): la Madeleine pretexte' (451-63), exploring the combination of different approaches to reality found in the work. 2. Consulate Writers Chateaubriand. P. Antoine, 'Chateaubriand en Egypte: le voya geur desenchante', Romantisme, 120:27-35, shows that, although</page><page sequence="7">French Studies C. visited Egypt, what he wrote about the country was more heavily influenced by his preconceived ideas and his imagination than by the, sometimes conflicting, reality which he encountered there. Jean-Paul Clement, Chateaubriand, cDes illusions contre des souvenirs3, Gallimard, 160 pp., is an attractive, well illustrated, and informative introduction which gives a clear perspective of C.'s literary merits. Pierre H. Dube, Nouvelle bibliographie refondue et augmentee de la critique sur Francois-Rene de Chateaubriand, Champion, 2002, 885 pp., is an essential tool for those working on C. and the 6019 entries are admirably indexed. Marc Fumaroli, Chateaubriand, poesie et terreur, Fallois, 800 pp., sets out to be rather more than a biography, taking as its main focus the slow development of the Memoires d'outre-tombe over the course of nearly half a century. Chapters are devoted to those who influenced C. and/ or with whom he came into personal contact, including Ballanche, Pauline de Beaumont, Byron, Joseph Conrad, Fontanes, Milton, Mirabeau, Napoleon, the abbe Raynal, Mme Recamier, Richelieu, Rousseau, Talleyrand, and Tocqueville. Emmanuelle Tabet, Chateau briand et le XVIIe siecle, memoire et creation litteraire, Champion, 2002, 461 pp., is an analysis of C.'s deep interest in the 17th c, particularly evident at the beginning of Le Genie du christianisme though present throughout his work, up to and including La Vie de Ranee, Tabet takes us beyond C.'s personal predilections to suggest a re-examination of the influence of i7th-c. literature on that of the 19th c, with a reassessment of certain salient features of Romanticism as part of a surviving Augustinian literary tradition. Ecrits politiques (1814-1816), ed. Colin Smethurst, Geneva, Droz, 2002, 586 pp., presents all of C.'s political writing during a period of three years which saw the fall of Napoleon, the first Restoration, the Hundred Days, Waterloo, and the second Restoration. This is a sound critical edition of that part of C.'s work which has tended to be forgotten, including newspaper articles and speeches, and is of considerable value for those who seek to understand both the period and the author's political thinking at that time. mme de stael. E. Gretchania, 'Madame de Stael. Lettres inedites a Fernand Christian', RHLF, 103:933-41, presents the text of four previously unpublished letters, written in 1803 and 1808, and preserved in Moscow. F. Lotterie, 'Une revanche de la "femme auteur"? Madame de Stael disciple de Rousseau5, Romantisme, 122:19-31, finds that although S. admired R. and used his manner of writing as a model, she was not a disciple in the conventional sense, concentrating on developing her own originality. Claire Garry Boussel, Statut et fonction du personnage masculin chez Madame de Stael, Champion, 2002, 447 pp., is a thorough analysis of the role of male characters in S.'s work, beginning with a typological classification</page><page sequence="8">The Romantic Era before moving on to an investigation of the triangular equilibrium between husbands, fathers, and lovers in her writing. Attention is given to what is termed the virtual hero and his eventual fall into disgrace. The conclusion stresses the relative vigour of the men who are portrayed, and the significant importance of Jacques Necker as a model. Brunhilde Wehinger, Conversation um 1800, Salonkultur und literarische Autorschaft bei Germaine de Stael, Berlin, Walter Frey, 2002, 259 pp., takes S. as the central figure in a discussion of the political and literary importance of conversation at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries. Particular attention is given to the exchanges which were made possible by her salons, also to the changing role of the author. 3. Poetry brizeux. H. Williams, 'Writing to Paris: poets, nobles and savages in nineteenth-century Brittany', FS, 57:475-90, identifies B.'s Marie as an important landmark in the development of Breton writing of French expression, showing the significance of his decision to write in French and the importance of his contribution to the bridging of the cultural gulf between Brittany and Paris. gay de girardin. Madeleine Lassere, Delphine de Girardin,journa liste et femme de lettres au temps du romantisme, Perrin, 345 pp., is a biography which lays due emphasis on G.'s writing, with numerous extracts inviting the reader to give further attention to both her poetry and her prose, yet which also gives a detailed account of her complex network of friendships with the writers of the time. hugo. A. Ben-Amos, 'Victor Hugo et les enterrements civils', Romantisme, 119:21-33, places the poem written for La Legende des siecles in 1875 within the context of the funerals H. attended around that time, including those of his sons, and notes the clear allusion to his own future death. E. Pich, ' "Zim-Zizimi": la singularity du progres hugolien', SFr, 47:250-58, is an appreciation of the poem. A. Spiquel, 'Epopee, lyrisme et coup d'etat: Hugo en 1877', ib., 259-66, is an evaluation of the works of that year. F. Lestringant, ' "L'Archipel de la Manche" ou l'insulaire de Hugo', ib., 267-74, considers H.'s work during exile. C. Retat, 'Hugo et les pierres vivantes', ib., 275-83, is concerned with H.'s references to William Shakespeare in later poetry and prose. R. Vignest, 'L'intertextualite latine dans la premiere serie de La Legende des sucks', ib., 284-301, explains a number of references by way of Latin verse. L. Sabourin, 'Victor Hugo et Alfred de Vigny', ib., 302-15, is concerned with their early friendship and its impact upon H.'s later work. J.-P. Pouget, 'L'amitie de deux geants: Victor Hugo et Alexandre Dumas pere', ib.,</page><page sequence="9">170 French Studies 316-29, shows the importance of their friendship and the evidence that may be found of it in H.'s writing. A. Poli, 'Victor Hugo e George Sand', ib., 330-52, examines the evidence relating to S.'s appreciation of H.'s achievements. C. Rizza, 'Theophile Gautier: un vieux d'Hernant, ib., 353-59, shows the significance of the relationship between the two. M. Richter, 'Hugo nelle Fleurs du MaP, ib., 360-77, measures the influence of H. on Baudelaire. J. Viard, 'Pierre Leroux et Victor Hugo', ib., 378-92, gives an account of the contact between the two at the Assemblee, in London, and on Jersey, finding that whereas Sand and Michelet acknowledged their debt to L., H. was inclined to make use of his ideas and writings without attribution. L. Sozzi, 'Le poesie di Hugo in Italia: opinioni, traduzioni, imitazioni', ib. 401-10, considers and compares Italian translations and adapta tions of H.'s poems. Victor Hugo (2003-1802). Images et transfigurations, ed. Maxime Prevost and Yan Hamel, Quebec, Fides, 190 pp., contains the proceedings of the 'Imago Hugolis' conference organized by the Montreal College de Sociocritique. As the tide suggests, the papers are concerned not so much with H.'s work as with the treatment of it. They include: P. Popovic, 'La mediation des tragediennes: Marie Dorval' (15-28), a fictional dialogue between H. and Pierre Bourdieu; M. Prevost, 'Les mysteres de Jersey. Representations de Hugo en spirite' (29?41), on the 'tables tournantes'; M. Conde, 'Pour Esme ralda: Notre-Dame de Paris au cinema' (43-60), explaining the success of films of the novel, though noting that some adaptation of the story is necessary; P. Brissette, ' Victus sed Victor, notes sur les photographies de l'exil' (61-76), suggesting that in these photographs, H. finally managed to achieve the public image he had been seeking; B. Melan con, 'Ceci tuer@ cel@' (77-87), on the presence of H. on the internet; I. Daunais, 'Hugo dirait: "J'etais plus pres de Dieu que de l'humanite"' (91-106), on Flaubert's admiration for H. and his meeting with him in 1843; M. Cambron, 'Victor Hugo au Quebec' (107-38), on the reception of his work and his influence on Quebecois writers; M. Angenot, 'Leon Daudet sur Victor Hugo: chose vue' (139-50), on D.'s connections with H.'s grandchildren, through friendship and also through marriage; E. Mechoulan, 'Cafe au lait avec vinaigre et moutarde: passages de Victor Hugo chez Walter Benjamin' (151-62), on the importance of the figure of H. in B.'s last work; B. Denis, 'Le cabotin sublime et les pisse-froid: Sartre, Hugo et la modernite' (163-74), comparing the concept of engagement in the life and work of the two writers; G. Marcotte, 'D'un Victor l'autre' (175-85), on Victor-Levy Beaulieu's admiration for H.'s writing. lamartine. G. Banderier, 'Sur un poeme de Lamartine, "A une jeune voyageuse en Suisse" ', FSB, 88:6-9, compares the Saint-Point</page><page sequence="10">The Romantic Era 171 and the Fatio manuscripts, showing that, though the latter is accompanied by the note "bonne version", it is probably a first draft which was extensively reworked. musset. G. Castagnes, 'Alfred de Musset, ou l'univers de la discontinuity', NCFS, 32:9-22, seeks to explain the fragmented, unfinished, discontinuous aspects of M.'s writing as a representation of his aesthetic principles. 4. The Novel J. Best, 'Quel horizon Ton voit du haut de la barricade', NCFS, 31:237-53, compares the representation of the barricade in novels by Dumas, Flaubert, and Hugo, and in paintings by Delacroix and Manet. R. Little, 'The first novels of Hugo and George Sand: a link', FSB, 86:7-8, finds similarities between the openings of Bug-Jargal and Indiana which appear to imply that S. had read the original version of H.'s novel. A. Lascar, 'Le regicide dans le roman francais (1824-1853)', Romantisme, 119:21-33, begins with Lamothe Langon's Le 21 janvier of 1825, and finds that the death of Louis XVI became a potent image which was used by novelists with increasing frequency, to serve a variety of different purposes. Linda M. Lewis, Germaine de Stael, George Sand and the Victorian Woman Artist, Columbia London, Missouri U.P., xiii + 278 pp., begins with a comparison of the treatment of the questions of female art and female creativity in Corinne and Consuelo, before demonstrating the very considerable impact of their work and their status on a number of Victorian women writers. Arielle Meyer, Le Spectacle du secret, Geneva, Droz, 261 pp., compares and contrasts Gautier's Mademoiselle de Maupin, Stendhal's Armance, Barbey D'Aurevilly's Les Diaboliques, and various novels by Zola. All are shown to display the transposition into the igth-c. novel of a theatrical motif elaborated by Marivaux. balzag. D. Knight, 'Skeletons in the closet: homosocial secrets in Balzac's La Comedie humaine", FS, 57:167-80, concentrates on B.'s habit of hiding narrative secrets in literal closets, thereby making them more amenable to discovery by accidental or deliberate acts of spying and eavesdropping, and shows how he makes use of a heterosexual convention of stage farce in La Cousine Bette in order to reveal its homosocial basis. Rastignac is then followed through La Maison Nucingen, Le Pere Goriot, and Splendeurs et miseres des courtisanes in an exploration of the epistemology of the closet. J. W. Mileham, 'Desert, desire, dezesperance: space and play in Balzac's La Duchesse de Langeais\ NCFS, 31 '.210-25, examines the novella's principal meta phor of movement through space. C. Rifeli, 'The language of hair in the nineteenth-century novel', ib., 32:83-96, begins with B.'s Honorine</page><page sequence="11">172 French Studies and La Peau de chagrin, before moving on to Flaubert, Maupassant, and Zola. ABa, 3.3, contains: C. Gaviglio-Faivre d'Arcier, 'Le vicomte de Lovenjoul de la bibliographic a la genetique' (7-25), on the considerable contribution of L. to B. studies in particular, though he also gave attention to Gautier, Nerval, and Sand, his close attention to bibliographical detail providing a basis for the study of the origins of the novels; S.

" ' (59-69), showing how B. uncoupled sexuality from biology and associated it with vulnerability, memory, and traumatism, prefiguring the attitudes of our present time; A.-M.

Oliver, Tenser le roman: Albert Savarus ou le roman comme transgression' (95-106), beginning with the observa tion that the idea that the text reflects the relationship with Mme Hanska in 1842 has prevented critics from appreciating the true value of its complex narrative situation and structure, its portrayal of social history, and its moral vision, which make it worthy of consideration as one of his best novels; A. Vaillant, ' "Cet X est la Parole": la litterature, ou la science mathematique de l'homme' (107-21),</page><page sequence="13">i74 French Studies examining the various theories which have been applied to explaining B.'s work, and concluding that only a recognition of the miraculous power of literary creation within B.'s metaphysical system, in effect an early form of Tart pour l'art', is suitable for the task; B.

Ebguy, 'Balzac ou "L'autre modernite": le Balzac des philosophies' (129-41), showing that B.'s new kind of writing was able to respond to previous philosophical discourse, and the response to it by later philosophers such as Deleuze, Ranciere, and Serres; S.

Ebguy, 'Un "raisonne dereglement de tous les sens": ce que l'ironie fait a l'histoire' (260-79), concluding that B.'s irony is an integral part of his critical and moral stance as a novelist. Regine Borderie, Balzacpeintre de corps, SEDES, 2002, 243 pp., is a detailed analysis of representations of the body in the numerous portraits of La Comedie humaine. It explains B.'s interest in physiognomy and compares his approach with that of his predecessors and with other major igth-c. writers. His portraits are shown to be a response to the complexity of society and the changes taking place in it at that time, be they social, aesthetic, philosophical, or narratological. Bettina Licht, Balzac, Leben und Werk des Romanciers, Mainz, Kostheim, 2002, 116 pp., is a short biography with an overview of his work and a summary of key novels. Michael Lucey, The Misfit of the Family: Balzac and the Social Forms of Sexuality, Durham-London, Duke U.P., 310 pp., acknowledges the influence of Pierre Bourdieu, and begins with forms of misfit that manifest themselves as failures of reproduction, before turning to those which involve specifically same-sex relations of various kinds. Pierre Glaudes, La Peau de chagrin d'Honore de Balzac, Gallimard, 257 pp., is a valuable introduction for those who are reading the text for the first time and a useful guide for those who are familiar with it. The essay and dossier are balanced and informative, leading the reader to a clear critical perspective. dumas. Bernard Blancotte, Alexandre Dumas . . . Un mousquetaire de Vecriture, Nimes, Lacour, 82 pp., is a worthwhile brief introduction to D.'s life and work, marking his bicentenary and his reinterment in</page><page sequence="16">The Romantic Era 177 the Pantheon. Catherine Toesca, Les 7 Monte-Cristo de Alexandre Dumas, Maisonneuve et Larose, 2002, 311 pp., is a biography which gives some indication of how far the novel tended to take over D.'s life. The structure is given by following the name from the port near to his father's birthplace, and then to the novel, before considering its seven further uses during his lifetime: for the chateau at Port Marly; the play; the periodical; the newspaper; the schooner; the Cuban cigar; the recipe. hugo. S. Luzzatto, 'La gaffe di Victor Hugo: il romanzo della Rivoluzione dai Miserables a Quatre-vingt-treize', SFr, 47:236-49, is concerned with reactions later in the century to H.'s work. sand. J. T. Booker, 'Indiana and Madame Bovary: intertextual echoes', JVCFS, 31:226-36, finds that, though there is no evidence that Flaubert had read S.'s novel, the two works seem to 'haunt' each other, and one may achieve a better perspective of both by reading them together. I. Hoog Naginski, 'George Sand: ni maitres ni disciples', Romantisme, 122:43-53, takes S. as a case study in the examination of the master/disciple paradigm, giving attention to the correspondence with Flaubert and the way in which she changed Balzac's character Foedora into her Lelia. Ville, campagne et nature dans I'ceuvre de George Sand, ed. Simone Bernard-Griffiths, Clermont-Ferrand, Univ. Blaise Pascal, 2002, 270 pp., contains the proceeding of the conference held at the Centre de Recherches Revolutionnaires et Romantiques in November 2000. It includes: S. Bernard-Griffiths, 'Ville/campagne/nature: regards sur une dialectique recurrente dans l'ceuvre sandienne' (11-15), introducing the topic and noting that S.'s writing is at its best when she not only covers each of the three environments but also elaborates links between them; J. Ehrard, 'La ville en France a la fin du XVIIIe siecle' (19-29), showing that, though the urban area only became an important phenomenon in the 19th c, its status underwent a profound change as the century progressed, and positive attitudes to that change derived mainly from i8th-c. writers; B. Hamon, 'George Sand de reconcilier villes et campagnes (mars-juin 1848)' (31-44), on S.'s contribution to the work of the Provisional Government of 1848, and how this led her to change her thinking, rejecting the cause of the urban worker in favour of that of the rural peasant; M. Vanderkerk hove-Caors, 'De La Chatre aux Couperies, itineraire romanesque et pelerinage intime' (45-57), on the representation in a number of works, spanning the whole of S.'s literary career, of the small town nearest to Nohant, and of a particular part of the surrounding countryside; H. Bonnet, 'La mythologie sandienne du village dans les Promenades' (59-73), identifying Gargilesse as the village, other than Nohant, which featured in her work; C. Plante, 'Oublier Clarens?</page><page sequence="17">i78 French Studies (sur Monsieur Sylvestre et Le Dernier Amour)' (75-89), identifying a common feature of the two novels in the concept of the countryside as a place where a character may seek to recover after a personal crisis; J. Guichardet, 'La presence de Paris dans Horace: George Sand dans le sillage balzacien' (91 -104), showing that the only novel which has Paris as its sole setting is not so much a reflection of the influence of Balzac as a manifestation of S.'s childhood memories and her feeling that the capital was a place of freedom; S. Bernard-Griffiths, 'Ville, nature et campagne dans Andre (1835) de George Sand' (107-33), finding that the novel plays on the virtual relationships between the three terms, by means of antithesis, synthesis, and inversion; P. Berthier, Lettres d'un vqyageur. le cru et le cuit' (135-47), considering the 12 letters in relation to the distance between nature and culture, and finding that they show S. successfully mediating between the two; G. Chalaye, 'La dialectique ville/nature dans Consuelo et La Comtesse de Rudolstadt de George Sand' (149-65), examining the relative importance of town and country in the two novels, and concluding that S.'s particular virtue is in going beyond the antagonism between nature and culture, and in developing the idea of cultural freedom; A. M. Rea, 'Babylone et Eden: ville et nature dans Isidore? (167-81), showing the novel of 1845-46 to represent a transition between the masculine city of the past and the Utopian city of the future, governed by liberated women; L. Giraud, 'Ville et nature, nature et culture dans Lucrezia Floriani' (183-96), considering S.'s views, as represented in the novel, on the natural environment as the ideal setting for a theatrical performance; D.

Grossir, 'Ville, nature et industrialisation dans Le Peche de Monsieur Antoine et La Ville noire' (207-20), on the only two of S.'s novels to represent the industrial world, the difference between the two, in their approach to the conflict between workers and peasants, being due, at least in part, to the events of 1848 which fell between them; S. Vierne, 'La nature, un refuge dans la ville' (221-35), showing that, when S. was unable to avoid the urban environment, she established in it points of refuge where she was able to regain contact with nature in order to write; N. Abdelaziz, 'Ville et nature: une morale structurelle du roman sandien?' (253-65), concluding that town and country were, for S., part of a moral framework, and that her novels were essentially concerned with moral development. stendhal. Y. Ansel, 'Stendhal: ni Dieu ni maitre', Romantisme, 122:33-42, seeks to explain the number of times that education is shown to fail, in Henry Brulard and the novels, as a reaction to the</page><page sequence="18">The Romantic Era 179 dominance which it implies. AnS, 2, begins with the proceedings of the conference, 'Paysage de Stendhal', held at the Sorbonne Nouvelle in September 2001: X. Bourdinet, ' "Les laideurs de la civilisation" ' (9-42), showing that S. was able to describe the ugly features of the I9th-c. world, as well as sublime landscapes, and that he was aware of the economics of tourism; F. Spandri, Taysages de l'odieux' (43-55), suggesting that S.'s ugly and unpleasant landscapes may be taken to reflect the imperfections of society, and to warn the reader of the dangers of social conflict; M. Marchetti, Taysages du sud' (57-73), on references to Naples in Rome, Naples et Florence, in the Journal and in the Correspondance; J.-J. Hamm, 'La chasse dans l'univers stendhalien' (75-88), a study of the motif of hunting and the light that it sheds on S.'s thought processes; S. Serodes, 'Le lac de Come ou l'autre naissance du sublime' (89-104), suggesting that S. invented the concept of lacustrian beauty, and worked to make it fashionable in novels; C. Mariette-Clot, Taysages silencieux et sublimes: l'obstacle de la description chez Stendhal' (105-14), on the manner of the description of landscape in S.'s travel writings, and his steadfast avoidance of the extremes of hyperbole and of banal realism; P. Jousset, 'La belle et la vilaine: la prose aux prises avec l'opine' (115-35), on two passages from the Memoires d'un touriste, which show to what extent S.'s literary sensibilities tended to lead him into a conflict between Beauty and Truth; G. Kliebenstein, 'Dysmimesis stendhalienne' (137-59), showing that S. is capable of transposing the reality of landscapes in two ways, either by simplifying their structure or through elaborating detail, involving change of location or anthropomorphism. The volume continues with articles con sidering the difficulties which S.'s texts present, and stressing the importance of their style in relation to classical models: F. Vanoost huyse, 'Stendhal et le classicisme: le cas d3Armance\\ 61 -77), exploring the classical influences which are visible in the novel; A. Hage, 'Crime et chatiment dans Le Rouge et le JVbzV' (179-209), examining various readings of the themes of crime and punishment, and suggesting that the story of Adrien Lafargue, as recounted in the Promenades dans Rome, is an important influence on the novel; S. Shimokawa, 'Stendhal et son penchant aristocratique: la nostalgie d'un monde a jamais revolu' (211-36), suggesting that S. was nostalgic for the old order of the Ancien Regime, that he considered himself to be an aristocrat, and that he associated the death of his mother with that of Marie Antoinette; B. Didier, 'Stendhal subtil interprete de La Fontaine' (237-43), showing the influence of the author of the Fables on S.'s life and work. It also includes: Y. Ansel, 'Meteorologie romanesque' (245-68), on the changes which Romanticism brought about in the description of the weather, with analysis of meteorological conditions</page><page sequence="19">i8o French Studies in Armance, Le Rouge et le Noir, Lucien Leuwen, La Chartreuse, and Lamiel, showing that though S. made use of the Romantic approach to weather, he avoided the imaginative interpretation, his more realistic approach depending on his theories concerning the climate; H. Mat tauch, 'Stendhal et le prefet de la Saale' (271-85), including some unpublished letters; Y. Uchida, 'Un article de Stendhal dans Le Globe* (287-303), on the possible authorship of an article of the 27 January 1825; J.-J.

Brigitte Diaz, Stendhal en sa correspondance ou eLHistoire d'un esprit', Champion, 460 pp., is a careful study of the importance of letter writing in S.'s life and work. The letters served many different purposes, but writing them was crucial to S.'s development as a writer. They give evidence of his inner thoughts and his intellectual development, as well as showing him to be involved in the exchange of ideas and critical debate, and they provide valuable information about the origins of the novels. Above all, it is shown that they helped him to become a great writer by providing him with experience of the production of text. Ann Jefferson, La Chartreuse de Parme, London, Grant and Cutler, 87 pp., is a useful and accessible introduction for students. Dorothee Kimmisch, Wirklichkeit als Konstruktion, Studien zu geschichte und Geschichtlichkeit bei Heine, Buchner, Immermann, Stendhal, Keller und Flaubert, Munich, Fink, 2002, 345 pp., includes two chapters on S., the first dealing with his ideological and historical construction of a social reality, the second with the poetics of his skill in using details to raise the level of his reader's awareness.

Gregory Lassard and Jean-Jacques Hamm, 2 vols, Hildesheim-Zurich-NY, Olms-Weidmann, 2002, v + 492, 1042 pp., based on the Pleiade edition, is a valuable tool for the analysis of S.'s style, one of a series intended in due course to cover all of S.'s prose fiction. sue. Christopher Prendergast, For the People by the People? Eugene Sue's Les Mysteres de Paris, Oxford, Legenda, 143 pp., examines the ways in which this novel not only became a major phenomenon of I9th-c. popular culture, but also played a significant role in con structing it. Careful attention is given to the reading public of S.'s time and to the influence of their reading habits and preferences upon the writing of the novel. In the conclusion, we are reminded that there is a difference between the perspective of the novel for S.'s</page><page sequence="20">The Romantic Era 181 readers and that of succeeding generations, though the merits of different views are effectively summarized. 5. Drama Olga Plaszczewska, Blazen i blazenstwo w dramacie romantycznym, Krakow, Universitas, 2002, 157 pp., compares the portrayal and function of fools and jesters in Hugo's Le Roi s'amuse, Marion de Lorme, and Cromwell, and also in Musset's Fantasio, with that in translations and other works by Polish dramatists. hugo.

We are shown the extent of L.'s interaction with, and commentary on, the society and institutions of his time. A significant dramatic innovation is shown in the introduction of sexuality into social interaction. L.'s moral ambiguity is carefully examined, and is judged to be a form of psychological realism. musset. Y. T. Beus, Alfred de Musset's Romantic irony', NCFS, 31:197-209, gives particular attention to Les Caprices de Marianne, On ne badinepas avec Vamour, Fantasio, and Lorenzaccio, showing that M. frees the dramatist from the physical restraints of the theatre in order fully to express the self-reflexivity of Romantic irony. 6.

Montalbetti, 'Premieres pages ou ces microscopiques Voyages en France qui s'ecrivent a la condition de voyages plus lointains' (117-30), finding that the opening pages tend to grapple with the essential difficulties of the genre; P. Antoine, 'Une rhetorique de la spontaneite: le cas de la Promenade' (131-46), showing that stylistic freedom reflects freedom of movement; B. Monier, 'Voyager: la poetique de Parabesque dans la litterature de voyage stendhalienne en France' (147-68), finding that the Memoires d'un touriste follow the arabesque tradition; M.

Chenet-Faugeras, 'La lettre xx du Rhin ou le voyage a contre-pied' (253-66), dealing with the problem that Hugo's Le Rhin does not fit into any recognisable genre by suggesting that it is an ironic allusion to the travel genre; C. Meynard, 'Le Tour de France de Flora Tristan: aux antipodes du recit de voyage romantique?' (267-88), concluding that the work of 1844 is at the very limit of its genre in its use of a pamphleteering style; W. Guentner, 'Flaubert satiriste dans Par les champs et par les greves' (289-308); M. Brix, 'Le Valois nervalien, ou la tentation orientale' (309-21), showing that Nerval associated the Valois with escapism; A. Deruelle,' "L'Egypte, c'est tout sables."

William Shakespeare, ed. Dominique Peyrache-Leborgne, Flammarion, 600 pp., is a text which merits greater attention, not least as a defence of a relative approach to criticism and for the pages concerned with translation. It is admirably presented here, with informative notes and a dossier which sets the work in its broader context. jomard. P. Bret, 'L'Egypte de Jomard: la construction d'un mythe orientaliste, de Bonaparte a Mehemet-Ali', Romantisme, 120:5-14, is concerned with the work of the main author of the Description de VEgypte, who as a young surveyor had accompanied Bonaparte's expedition and who, in combining an Utopian view of Ancient Egypt with a vision of its contemporary potential for modernization, is shown to have been partly responsible for the Romantic myth of the Orient. lamartine. Autour de Lamartine: Journal de voyage, correspondances, temoignages, iconographie, ed. Christian Croisille and Marie-Renee Morin, Clermont-Ferrand, Univ. Blaise Pascal, 2002, vii + 251 pp., though not specifically concerned with L.'s poetry, gives valuable insights into the poet's life. It contains five articles by M.-R. Morin: 'Correspondances autour du buste de Lamartine par le comte d'Orsay' (109-24), presenting the letters which were discovered in 1967 connected with the sculptor of L.'s bust, one of them including eight strophes of the resulting poem; 'Deux lettres de Lamartine en 1824' (I25~3?)&gt; concerning a letter to Aymon de Virieu and one which was probably addressed to Achille Prevost, at the time when L. was seeking a posting in Florence; 'Souvenirs lamartiniens du prefet Barthelemy' (185-226), connected with the reminiscences of encounters with L. by Hyacinthe-Claude-Felix B., at the time when the latter was serving as prefet in Macon; 'Lamartine au Salon (1822-1899): essai d'iconographie lamartinienne' (227-46), on 120 paintings, drawings, and statues of L. or inspired by his work; 'Lamartine, notes et dates pour biographie: premiere(?) autobiogra phic, vers 1834' (247-49), reproducing the notes written on both sides of a single piece of paper, which was sold in 1997. Other articles in the volume are: N. Courtinat, 'Le Voyage en Orient de Lamartine, journal de voyage et journal intime' (3-60), showing that the Journal is worthy of attention, not only for what it reveals of L.'s personal experience, but also for the evidence which it gives concerning his manner of writing; W. Fortescue, 'Lettres retrouvees de Lamartine</page><page sequence="23">French Studies (1815-1868)' (63-107), presenting a number of previously unpub lished letters, written by L. and by his wife, which have come to light in the British Library, the Bodleian Library, Parisian libraries, and private collections; C. Croisille, 'Marianne de Lamartine au travail: sa collaboration a VHistoire de la Restauration, au Civilisateur et au Nouveau Voyage en Orient' (130-81), presenting a considerable number of previously unpublished letters addressed to the publisher Guil laume Lejean in 1852, implying that she acted as L.'s secretary. nerval. M. Brix, 'Nerval et le reve egyptien', Romantisme, 120:37-46, finds that the rather negative portrayal of Egypt in Le Voyage en Orient is essentially based on what he had read before he went there, and his failure to find there what literary sources had led him to expect. nodier.

Jean-Francois Jeandillou, Geneva, Droz, lix + 208 pp., is a scholarly critical edition of the work first published in 1812, with an ample and valuable apparatus criticus. sainte-beuve. Michel Brix, Sainte-Beuve ou la liberte critique, Jaignes, La Chasse au Snark, 2002, 93 pp., both observes and justifies the rehabilitation of S.-B., with reference to his voluminous output, his independence of mind, his treatment by Hugo, and by writers of later generations such as Baudelaire and Proust. tristan. Porfiro Mamani Macedo, Flora Tristan: la paria et lafemme etrangere dans son ceuvre, L'Harmattan, 77 pp., gives particular attention to Necessite defaire bon accueil aux femmes etrangeres, Peregrinations d'une paria, and LEmancipation de la femme ou le testament de la paria. We are shown that T.'s ideas derived largely from her life experience, though emphasis is given to her confidence in the ability of women to play an important role in society. Beginning with an analysis of her concept of woman as a pariah, we are led through her reflections on the experience of being foreign, before we come to a summary of her proposals, not only to improve the position of foreign women in society, but the amelioration of society as a whole.</page><page sequence="24">The Romantic Era THE NINETEENTH CENTURY (POST ROMANTIC) POSTPONED THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 1900-1945 POSTPONED THE TWENTIETH CENTURY SINCE 1945 POSTPONED</page></plain_text>
