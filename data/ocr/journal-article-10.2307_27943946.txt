<plain_text><page sequence="1">PEIRCE'S ATTEMPT AT A VERIFIABLE DEFINITION OF ffGOD" Edwin Hubbard Martin / William Rainey Harper College I. Introduction?The Object of This Paper Every person skilled in Musement will see that the Doctrine of the Ens necessarium has a pragmatistic meaning, although I will not here attempt to sum up the whole of its meaning. So far as it has such a meaning, it is verifiable.1 The Verification/Falsification debate of earlier this century is clearly somewhat passe, yet the subject of the verification criterion of meaning as applied to the concept of G-d2 will not go away, I believe, in its essentials, because it represents the intersection of two of the oldest questions in the philosophy of religion: the question concerning religious language, which dates back at least to Plato, and the question concerning a posteriori proofs of G-d, which dates back at least to Aristotle. The demand for verifiable or 1 HJAD ms 844. The following abbreviations are used for Peirce's published works: CP ? Collected Papers, ed. C. Hartshorne &amp; P. Weiss, Vols I - VI; ed. A Bums, Vols.

When referring to the idea or the concept of the divine, I use "God." 149</page><page sequence="2">150 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy falsifiable definitions is simply the demand for empirically testable ideas, ideas that, if true, will make a difference in matters of fact. If the logical positivists and their latter day defenders have had a difficult time making their own criterion of meaning clear and consistent, it can not be said that their opponents carried the field with triumphant new clear and consistent definitions of G-d. Instead, theirs was a purely negative victory, if victory it was, which amounted to saying that, when it comes to vagueness, you, the logical positivists, are as bad as we, the theists, are. Charles Sanders Peirce anticipated much of the twentieth century form of the debate.3 He did not shrink from facing the challenge of giving a verifiable definition of G-d, but labored hard to formulate one, one that would point to facts which would follow from the reality of G-d, but not from Hs/r4 unreality. At a very general level, there were three such facts that he pointed to: the fact that G-d, or at least a sign of G-d, can be directly perceived by any normal person contemplating reality as a whole with sufficient openness of mind; the fact that retroduction, or that form of argument by means of which explanatory hypotheses are produced, is an objectively valid logical procedure, which can be shown to produce true hypotheses at a much better than random rate; and the fact that belief in G-d results in an increase in the ability gradually to improve one's self-control. The purpose of this paper is to give the evidence that Peirce was attempting to come up with a pragmatistic definition of "Ens Necessarium," a definition, that would be, in his words, "verifiable"; and to present and analyze the most developed product ofthat attempt. This most developed definition, hereafter referred to as the Verifiable Definition, is as follows: If, for example, the predication of a given concept ["God" as a definable concept: Ens necessarium] were to lead [logically] to our admitting that a given form of reasoning [retroduction] concerning the subject of which it was 3 Cf. e.g. CP 5.423;1905. 4 Mjjg/jM jj^y vocalized ?&lt;his or ner"; "his," or "her," at random; or either "his" consistently or "her" consistently according to the the sex of the reader.

The passage comes from the article "A Neglected Argument for the Reality of G-d" published in the Hibbert Journal in 1908 and reprinted with inaccurate and confusing notes in the Collected Papers.1 It is in the various drafts8 of that article, mostly unpublished or mislabelled, or from papers of nearly the same period, that one finds most of Peirce's various attempts to come up with a pragmatistic or verifiable definition of "God". It is presumed that the reader of this paper is familiar with this article and with the two Popular Science articles that make up his initial essay on pragmatism. . Peirce's Understanding of "God" and the "Being of God" I describe in the following section [of the proposed Hibbert Journal Article] as well as I can what I mean by God, the Being of God, a belief in the Being of God, and a rational Belief in the Being of God. In the third section I will give an account of the process of thought which I mean by this 5 HJA CP 6.481. 6 As elsewhere in this paper. 7 My research indicates that there are three crucial errors made by the editors of the Collected Papers with regard to the manuscripts connected with the HJA: 1. They misdated ms 842 to 1905 (instead of 1908). 2. They state (in a footnote Vol. VI page 326) that, when Peirce wrote to James (PJC 11/17/08:3), "I never contemplated the possibility of the last section being published," he was referring to 6.478-485. In fact, this 'last section" begins at 6.481. 3. They dated the "Additament" to cl910-1911. In fact it is a draft version of the 'last section" (6.481-485) and was thus written in 1908. 8 The manuscripts texts of the drafts in order of composition are: ms 277;11/4/08 "Outline for a Paper for the Hibbert Journal"; ms 842 first draft, with two sequences; ms 843 second, and third drafts with multiple sequences; ms 841 "final" draft; ms 844; S-844 "Additament"; i.e., draft of'last section."</page><page sequence="4">152 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy particular "argument", and in the fourth section, I will discuss some of the questions of logic which it suggests.9 As printed, the HJA begins with a brief definition of terms, and then has a long section describing the Humble Argument, a long section discussing certain issues in the logic of science, and then a concluding section followed by the appended "last section." It was Peirce's original intent to precede the description of the Humble Argument with a section defining four key terms: "God", "the Being of God", "belief in the Being of God", and "rational belief in the Being of God". His failure to do so renders the final text obscure to the general reader. The purpose of the next three sections of this paper is to remedy that failure. This section will investigate Peirce's understanding of the word "God," and of the term "Ens Necessarium," which is the "Being of God." Because there is a good deal of misunderstanding of the subject, and because Peirce's own thinking was evolving quickly during the course of writing the HJA, it will be necessary to outline succinctly the development of his conception of G-d during the various stages of his career.10 Briefly, in his Early Period (1857-1867) Peirce conceived of G-d as the Infinite, about which no more will be said. In his first Mature Period (1866-1879) his conception of G-d was semiotic. He conceived of the evolving universe as a developing sign, or, to use the language of the HJA, the body of a sign. Its starting point, a point of no Information but of Infinite Breadth (a point that in later works he would call the Absolute First) was the Ground of the sign, the Holy Spirit. The end 9 HJAD ms 277:11/4/08. 10 The periodization of Peirce's intellectual career used here is as follows: 1857 to 1866 The Early System ; 1866 to 1879 The Mature System; 1885 to 1898 First Revision of the Mature System; 1896 to 1908 Second Revision of the Mature System; 1906 to 1911 Third Revision of the Mature System, It will be seen that the scheme of the division does not differ much from those of Murray G.

The Object of the sign was G-d the Father. In this scheme G-d had only a diminished reality, a reality in futuro, with respect to the actual universe itself. By the time of the period of the First Revision (1885-1898), Peirce had assimilated the implications of the logic of relatives. Generality (the characteristic of signs) had become Continuity and had become the most real of the metaphysical categories, while Actuality (the second category) was now thought of as having a diminished reality, being a mere negation of continuity. It was during this period that Peirce developed the notion of Mind, or G-d, as the capacity to take habits, a notion that he renames Ens Necessarium in the HJA. It is the G-d of this period that most nearly anticipates Whitehead's process G-d, a G-d, or Cosmic Reason, developing through time, responsive to the chance events of history, and weaving them into laws or habits until the whole universe becomes hide-bound with habits. Loosely speaking, G-d is the Thirdness or Reasonableness of the universe. It is permissible to think of chance events as the will of G-d,11 but, since the metaphysical category of primal Firstness, from which all Chance issues, is not real, one is simply making a distinction without a difference. In the period of his Second Revision (1896-1908), as a result in part of Cantor's success in defining different degrees of infinity, Peirce comes to acknowledge the reality of Firstness. He now identifies the metaphysical supposition of Firstness, the Absolute, with G-d, and demotes the metaphysical supposition of Thirdness, the Reasonableness of the Universe, to a secondary place as a "demi-god" or "demiurge." In fact, he says that there may be many universes each with its own demiurge, and there may be universes within universes, so that not only is the Reason of our universe a mere demigod, but that universe as a whole is only part of a universe of a higher order, with its own demigod, and so forth on to meta-uni verses of a still higher order. One might call this the Absolute/Demiurge model of G-d, a model in which the Absolute is the only true G-d, although the demiurge of 11 HJAD ms 842.125; cf CP 6.199; 1898.</page><page sequence="6">154 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy our universe, no matter that s/he be one of an infinite series of demigods, is none-the-less, as Peirce notes, "a god relative to us." This is the position at which Peirce had arrived when he started drafting the HJA, an article written in the latter part of the transition between the period of the Second Revision and the period of the Third Revision. In early drafts ofthat article he states that by the proper name "God" he shall refer to "the Being whose Attributes are, in the main, those usually ascribed to Him, Omniscience, Omnipotence, Infinite Benignity, a Being not 'immanent in' the Universes of Matter, Mnd, and Ideas..."12 Moreover he affirms that the argument that he is to present would not be true of any Being other than such a transcendent G-d.13 In other related manuscripts, written within the year, Peirce denounces the "finite God"14 of the "so called" or "pseudo" Pragmatists such as James, Dewey, and Schiller, and affirms his own belief in the "reality of the Absolute as set forth, for example, by Royce".15 In fact the finite "god" of the "pseudo-pragmatists"16 is merely a "demi-god," one of "a whole race of beings immensely superior to ourselves, such as for example, that the whole visible universe might be no more than a nucleolus in a single cell of the body of one of them".17 In the subsequent drafts of the article he changes his position, until we find that in its published version the Absolute/Demiurge metaphysical model of G-d has been replaced by what might be called a two-tier epistemological or logical model of G-d. In this view although G-d is really transcendent, still we must conceive of Hm/r as immanent:18 and although in Peirce's belief G-d creates all three universes of experience,19 still his argument for G-d shows Hm/r definitely as creator of two of them.20 This two tier epistemology, which distinguishes between G-d as S/he is, and G-d as S/he can be known, eventually gives rise to a two tier metaphysic of G-d, so that 12 HJAD ms 843.1. 13 HJAD ms 841(s) quoted below; also HJAD ms 843.4. 14 See HJAD ms 841(s) quoted below; also HJAD ms 843,4 15 Ms 630. 16 CP 5.346; cl909.

In fact his later experimentation with the idea of a fourth category, one representing the conjunction of particularity and indeterminacy,21 is also with the end in view of imagining a sort of Divine Universe transcendent to the three Universes of Experience, an incomprehensible realm that is thinkable only by analogy to time in which the Divine is present immanently. The error frequently made in assessing the development of Peirce's conception of G-d is to judge that it remained essentially the same throughout his career?that he always identified G-d with the Reasonableness of the cosmos. One of the reasons for this error is that Peirce changes not only his conception of G-d, but also his conception of conceiving of G-d. Peirce came to believe that a distinction must be made between G-d as S/he could be understood following the scientific method, and as S/he could be understood following the method of apriority, a method of less "security," but more "uberty," and a method of less philosophical clarity, but of more religious value. While in the period of the Second Revision (1896-1908) Peirce has demoted Reasonableness to the status of a demiurge, during the writing of the HJA he decides scientific method, that is, pragmatistic method, will not allow him to exclude Reasonableness as one possible and d?fendable conception of G-d. Therefore, Peirce in effect allows for the legitimacy of such an intellectual model of G-d, causing some interpreters falsely to conclude that it was still his own. In fact, Peirce now implicitly claims that his argument for G-d in the Hibbert Journal could justify at least three different models of G-d. The strongest of these models, which he personally accepts, is the two tier model given above. Within this model, there is mind/body interaction within the created universes, but G-d Hm/rself only appears to be adjusting to the events of history, and to be adapting means to ends;22 in reality Sh/e wills ends directly for reasons beyond our understanding, and every event is 21 One way of characterizing the three categories is that Firstness is general and indeterminate, Secondness is particular and determinate, and Thirdness is general and deterrninate. Earlier in his career Peirce had been content to believe that the fourth possibility was a null set. 22 HJA CP 6.479.</page><page sequence="8">156 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy such an end. In fact G-d in Hm/rself is beyond comprehension, and strictly speaking Peirce provides a Verifiable Definition not of "God," but of the Ens necessarium, which for Peirce is not the essence of G-d, but only Hs/r mode of being. The Verifiable Definition, then, allows for a "rational Belief in the Being of God," but no claim is made for a rational belief in G-d Hm/rself. This strongest model of G-d is wholly compatible with orthodox Christian notions of G-d, and illuminates them admirably from a metaphysical standpoint. In the model of middling strength G-d creates and transcends only two of the Three Universes of Experience, presumably being either identical to or at least wholly immanent in the Third Universe, the Universe of Mind. This model is interactionalist with respect to finite bodies and minds as was the stronger model, but unlike that it is also interactionalist with respect to the Cosmos and its Infinite Mind. Under this notion, G-d not only appears to be subject to the vicissitudes of chance events, but is so in fact, albeit S/he tames them and makes them conform to law in the end. This model closely resembles that outlined in his Monist series on "Evolutionary Love" written during the period of the First Revision. In the third and weakest model of G-d alluded to in the Hibbert Journal article, the Cosmos and every actual thing and event in it can be accounted for on a purely reductionistic physical basis, but this still leaves the need for a parallel mental account?a teleological account?for mental phenomenon can not ever be explained in purely materialistic terms.23 It might seem that, of these three models, the weakest, which is the minimalist and logically simplest model, ought to be provisionally adopted, but Peirce argues otherwise. He believes that it is not the logically simplest, but the instinctively simplest concept, the one simplest in the natural light of reason, which is to be preferred, and that would be an anthropomorphic concept of G-d such as is found in the strongest model.24 The Verifiable Definition of G-d that he eventually comes up with is compatible with all three models, but, since it predicts the validity of retroduction, it points to a distinction between them based upon this appeal to instinctive simplicity. That is, it points beyond itself as a scientific method of understanding to an a priori method of understanding. Yet, since the 23 HJA CP 6.476. 24 HJA CP 6.477.</page><page sequence="9">Vol. 16, No. 2, May 1995 157 method of apriority is an appeal to tastes in ideas, the definition can do no more than to indicate the possibility of direct experience of G-d upon which to base such aesthetic judgments. . Peirce's Analysis of The Concept "Faith" in The HJA What is the ultimate assurance of the truth of the conclusion of any reasoning? I answer that it must be, as unreasoned, of the nature of a Faith. This Faith must relate to the general character of the Universe to which the reasoning relates, and must in substance be that that Universe is governed by an Active Reason corresponding to that exerted in the act of inference.25 Each of the three models just given represents a possible hypothesis in scientific metaphysics, or in "natural theology" as Peirce claims he is doing. But a conception of G-d that has truly religious value would need to be more than merely theoretical, and more than merely aesthetic. It would need to involve a "living" faith. In fact, Peirce's pragmatistic rendering of the notion of G-d defines Hm/r, in effect, as the object of such a faith; that is, the object of the belief implicit in a person's conduct, rather that the object of a theoretically held belief, or of a religious experience. These distinctions, and their ramifications, are not made altogether clear in the text of the HJA or in its drafts. Fortunately, one of Peirce's correspondents, Victoria Lady Welby, found the argument to be as obscure as do most modern readers, and she asked for a clarification. Peirce found it painful to give one: Your pleading that I should not use such a phrase as "attractive fancy", and I suppose you might feel so about the phrase "strictly hypothetical God", seems to show that I quite failed to convey my sense of the value of the Neglected Argument, in that it does not lead to any theology at all, but only to what / mean by a purely religious Faith, which will 25 Ms630:9;1909.</page><page sequence="10">158 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy have already taken deep root before the subject of it thinks of it at all as a belief. Writing this is like having to explain a joke.26 Peirce explains to her that the New Testament word for faith, PISTIS, means "trust; i.e. belief in something not as having knowledge or approach to knowledge about the matter of belief, but 'implicit faith', as the Catholics say, i.e. belief in it derived from one's belief that a witness who testifies to it would not so testify to it if it were not so. " In fact, Peirce writes in the letter, the word "faith" should be restricted to mean "that which [a believer] is prepared to conform his conduct to, without recognizing what it is to which he is conforming his conduct. For example, if I do not know what Liddell &amp; Scott say is the meaning of PISTIS but am convinced that whatever they say is its meaning really is so, I have faith that it is so."27 Note that Peirce's definition of "faith" is reflexive: it is a belief in a belief. What, then, in natural theology, where there is no question of the Church or of the Book, would be the "witness" or "authority" in which a religious believer puts hs/r trust? It would be the process of scientific inquiry. The scientist's attitude is that, whatever the hypothesis s/he may provisionally hold to at the moment, hs/r faith is in the process and not in hs/r own present opinion, and s/he implicitly believes whatever is the ultimate outcome of the process, although that outcome is at present unknown and may possibly prove to be a far different hypothesis than s/he now provisionally holds to: Every true man of science, i.e. every man belonging to a social group all of the members of which sacrifice all the ordinary motives of Ufe to their desire to make their beliefs concerning one subject conform to verified judgments of per ception taken together with sound reasoning, and w7ho therefore really believes the universe to be governed by reason, or in other words by God, but who does not explicitly recognize that he believes in God,?has Faith in God according to my use of the term Faith.. .For to believe 26 SS p.76; 23/12/08. 27 SSp.74-75;23/12/08</page><page sequence="11">Vol. 16, No. 2, May 1995 159 in reasoning about phenomena is to believe that they are governed by reason, that is by God. That to my mind is a high and wholesome belief.28 Notice that he commends this belief as "high and wholesome," but does not identify it with his own belief. On the contrary, Peirce is, by this time in his life, not merely an arch-conservative politically (as most people know), but also a High Church Episcopalian in religion (which is less well known); and not only does he explicitly recognize his own belief in G-d, unlike the agnostic scientist, but he also acknowledges an implicit faith in the traditional teachings of the church. According to his own opinions, that is, according to the G-d hypothesis that he provisionally holds, Active Reason (also called the "Plastic Nature," the " Artifex of Nature," etc.,29 while it may be a god with respect to us, is not an entirely adequate object of worship or explanation of the cosmos. It is, ifit is not a mere demiurge or demigod, the mere form that a transcendent, omniscient, omnipotent and infinitely incomprehensible G-d appears to have when apprehended by finite intellects. As an existential matter, one must sometimes "assume" a given position, and though it be "extremely doubtful," never-the-less "one must dismiss doubts on the matter from consideration...in order to conduct oneself with vigorous consistency" [ibid], but to do so is commitment and not certitude. As he had written years earlier "owe what one may to the Church, the truth claims paramount allegiance; and above the importance of any particular truth, or body of truths, is that of the right methods of reaching the truth."30 Peirce thinks that the non-believing scientist really has faith in G-d, or more precisely in the "Being of G-d"?the Ens necessarium?although sh/e does not recognize it as such. On the level of conduct s/he acts like a believer, following the leading of the Spirit (i.e. retroducing), and sacrificing self interest to the quest for the Ideal (i.e., Truth). But this scientist is unaware of the rational ground for hs/r self-sacrifice, and for hs/r hope of advancing human knowledge. The pragmatistic definition of G-d identifies the "Ens Necessarium" as that concept which, if truly predicable, would provide such 28 SS p.75; 23/12/08. 29 Cf.ms2802.23;1905. 30 CP 6.450; 1893.</page><page sequence="12">160 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy a justifying ground. But the fact that this scientist can not adequately justify hs/r faith in the process of scientific inquiry does not mean that s/he lacks it, and that faith is tantamount to a faith in G-d, a G-d whom s/he neither understands nor acknowledges. IV. Pragmaticism and a Rational Belief in The Being of G-d But because the great majority of contemporary pragmatists are pluralists, believe only in a finite god, and therefore ought logically to be polytheists, and hold to the horrible doctrine...of the essay "The Will to Believe," I have changed the name of the doctrine...to pragmaticism. Every practitioner of Musement will see that the doctrine of the Ens necessarium has a pragmatiste meaning.31 A "rational faith in the Being of God," in contradistinction to the scientist's unacknowledged faith, must explicitly recognize its object, and have an intellectual conception of it, one to be gained through the pragmatic method. Just as the Verification/Falsification Debate represents an intersection of two long standing issues in the philosophy of religion, so the Hibbert Journal article in which Peirce most nearly anticipates that debate represents the intersection of two leading concerns of his own?his metaphysical side and his pragmatic side. Most Peirce scholars would agree that the first printed anticipation of the Pragmatic Maxim, albeit only an early version of it, is found in his 1871 review of The Worfa of George Berkeley in The North American Review. There he states, "a better rule for avoiding the deceits of language is this: Do things fulfill the same function practically? Then let them be signified by the same word. Do they not? Then let them be distinguished."32 It is also in this article that Peirce gives one of his first clear anticipations of the verification/falsification issue: The truth is that the minds from whom the spirit of the age emanates have now no interest in the only problems that 31 HJAD ms 841(s). 32 CP 8.33.</page><page sequence="13">Vol. 16, No. 2, May 1995 161 metaphysics ever pretended to solve. The abstract acknow ledgment of God, Freedom, and Immortality... is now seen to have no practical consequence whatever.33 From the very first, then, in Peirce's mind the pragmatic maxim was linked with the problem of the practical consequences associated with belief in G-d. Throughout his intellectual career after that article Peirce returns again and again to the question of what practical consequences could be drawn from his metaphysical system. In particular, in the Monist metaphysical series written during the period of the First Revision, Peirce points out many practical predictions entailed by his theory, quite in line with the maxim. Towards the end ofthat period in 1896, however, William James introduced the word "pragmatism" to the public, the concept entered into general discussion, and pragmatism became a topic of popular debate. The popular conception of it was that philosophy of any sort was only justified in so far as it relates to the vital issues of real life. Peirce reacted sharply against this interpretation in his definition of the word in Baldwin's Dictionary4? almost repudiating the maxim. By 1903, however, he had reconsidered, and accepted the maxim, with, however, his own gloss upon it: the meaning of a concept resides not in any particular actions consequent upon believing in it, but in those habits of action issuing from rational conduct. Furthermore, he specifies that the pragmatic maxim does not give the meaning of all concepts, but only of "intellectual concepts," which is to say univocal ones. These two qualifications of the maxim are carried over to the time of the HJA, and some more are added. However, only these two need concern us. A change that does need to concern us is the application of the maxim to the concept of G-d. In his original outline for the HJA in April of 1908, Peirce claimed that the muser's experience of G-d was so overwhelming that it was impossible for hm/r to criticize the proposition of G-d's reality, "for real criticism implies real doubt, and nobody acquainted with this can doubt it."35 But a pragmatistic understanding is a critical understanding. Since those 33 CP8.33;1871. 34 CP 5.3; 1902. 35 HJAD ms 277; unp</page><page sequence="14">162 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy convinced of G-d through the pre-critical process of musement are so thoroughly persuaded that they inquire no further; and since those who have not through musement been grasped by the majesty of the Idea of G-d's reality are also ill equipped to criticize it, not truly understanding it, the question of apragmatistic definition of G-d is finessed. A year or two before writing this, he had noted that the word "God" was one of the vaguest words there was, and that any attempt to "preside (or render precise) the conception [would] change it, and such precise conception is easily shown not to be warranted."36 By the middle drafts of the HJA, however, he has changed his position. Now he claims that there is a middle ground between a verifiable definition and utter meaninglessness, and that the concept "G-d" occupies such ground: The reveur [i.e. muser] must early decide upon his own answer to the question whether there be any reasonable mean between abandoning all attempt to understand and assuming in reference to each problem that presents itself, that it is either meaningless or is amenable to [scientific] inquiry. If he decides there is no such middle course he may as well ask himself at once, why any of the Universes are in Being at all. This amounts to the problem?supposing nothing at all were, even in Idea....37 In the final draft, however, and especially in the drafts of the "last section," Peirce takes the position that, although "there is great danger" that the muser will fail to investigate the notion of G-d further, once s/he is convinced, "owing to the indifference of the Muser to any further proof of it,"38 yet such further inquiry is possible and called for, and can lead to the conclusion that a presided notion of G-d is justifiable,39 if only as a bulwark supporting the vaguer, more instinctual notions. Hence, in the HJA we have three grades of clearness of G-d to G-d as immediately, vaguely, instinctually, and forcefully 36 CP 6.494-496;cl906. 37 HJAD ms 8432r.26 1/2. 38 HJAD CP 6/488. 39 HJA CP 6.485.</page><page sequence="15">Vol. 16, No. 2, May 1995 163 apprehended in musement; G-d as the definable concept Ens Necessarium, creator of the Three Universes of Experience out of Nothing; and G-d as fully presided by a pragmatistic definition, that is, by a definition that yields, not just explanations, but verifiable predictions. V. The Three Predictions from The G-d Hypothesis ...[I]ts beauty...its supplying an ideal of life, and for its thoroughly satisfactory explanation of [the] threefold environment.40 Having formulated the problem of the pragmatic definition of G-d in a way that anticipates the verification falsification debate in its essentials, along with other lines of attack on the problem Peirce is prepared to provide a definition of G-d that meets the criterion of pragmatistic clearness. As has already been averred, there are three general predictions from the hypothesis of G-d. The three predictions are logically related, although Peirce only occasionally points this out. The primary prediction from the G-d hypothesis is that the Idea of G-d is directly perceivable, and the second predicted fact?the validity of retroduction?is deducible from the primary prediction, and the third?the prediction of an increase in self-control?is deducible from the first two. A full account of the logic of this progression of ideas?from the hypothesis of G-d's Reality to the prediction of direct perception of the Idea of G-d, and from that to the predictions of the validity of retroduction, and to its value for growth in self-control?would involve going deeply into Peirce's metaphysics and semiotics, and would be impossible in an article of this length. Peirce twice tried to give such metaphysical account within the compass of the Hibben Journal article, once in the first draft41 where he brings in his model of G-d from projective geometry, and once in the draft of the added final portion,42 but both times he had to cut it out because he had run over his word limit. Here, a brief clarification of the claim of three 40 HJA CP 6.465. 41 HJAD ms 8422.135. 42 HJAD CP 6.490.</page><page sequence="16">164 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy predictions, and some references to key passages in support of the claim is all that can be attempted. The pragmatistic method is a generalization of the scientific method, and in the logic of scientific inquiry the first step is the appearance of a surprising phenomenon, i.e., one that lacks explanation. In the case at hand that phenomenon is the existence of anything at all. Why is there something rather than nothing? The next step of inquiry is to develop an hypothesis which, if true, would account for the surprising phenomenon. In this case the hypothesis is that originally there was nothing rather than something. It is then shown that such a state of Nothingness would be a state of primal chaos, which is to say a state of total ind?termination. But this state of indeteimination must include the habit of taking habits, or it would be in some way determined. This habit of taking habits is Necessary Being. It must have a tendency to increase itself, that is, to grow, or else it would not be a habit of taking habits. In the growth of Necessary Being the three Universes of Experience will successively emerge. Eventually everything that is will be a further determination of this habit of taking habits, and that will be the end state of cosmic development, the Absolute Second. Meanwhile, the state of the cosmos will be one in which there is more than Nothing, but less than complete embodiment of Reason, the state in which we find ourselves, and the state to be explained by our hypothesis. In order to test that hypothesis it is necessary to predict facts that were not part of the original data to be explained. One such fact is that growth will be one of the key characteristics of the Three Universes of Experience, a characteristic especially apt to lead the muser, if the muser is an inspired guesser, to the hypothesis of G-d's reality.43 But that hypothesis itself, since it implies that the muser's mind is a further determination of the Ens necessarium, predicts that the muser will be an inspired guesser. Therefore the muser asks the question "why is there something rather than nothing," and the hypothesis of G-d's reality develops in hs/r mind as an answer that, were it true, would provide a satisfactory explanation of the origin of the three Universes of Experience from nothing. As a test of the truth of the hypothesis, it is then shown that it predicts the empirical result that it itself will arise eventually and naturally in the mind of anyone pondering that question. 43 HJA CP 6.465.</page><page sequence="17">Vol. 16, No. 2, May 1995 165 An important point to be made is that the prediction concerning the perceptibility of a retroductive argument for G-d's Reality is a reflexive prediction: it follows from the hypothesis of G-d's Reality that is retroduced in musement that there will be some such process as musement in which the hypothesis of G-d will instinctively be retroduced. Now this first prediction from the G-d hypothesis implies a corollary prediction?the validity of retroduction. This second prediction can take two forms, a semi-a-priori form and a truly a posteriori form. The former is the argument that, since "the warrant of Hypothesis (retroduction) is mainly that unless the human intellect is akin to the Creative Spirit, it is useless to attempt any discovery of...empirical truth beyond direct perception"44 one ought to adopt the the regulative principle that there is an il lume naturale that gives humans the "power of divining" G-d's thoughts, of "guessing right."45 But Peirce does not confine himself to this sort of semi-apriori argument. He believes that the methods of scientific inquiry can be applied to historical studies, and therefore ventures the virtual prediction that an historian of science will find that most correct hypotheses have been retroduced after an unreasonably small number of guesses, and are unusually convincing.46 This virtual prediction, then, allows us another way to give a pragmatistic meaning to the word "God": ...some...say that it is only negatively, as being entirely different from everything else, that we can attach a meaning to the Name. This is not so; because the discoveries of science, their enabling us to predict what will be the course of nature is proof conclusive that though we cannot think any thought of G-d's, we can catch a fragment of His Thought, as it were47 44 NEMm/2.873;1909. 45 The basic idea of this argument is very old. See WP 1.448;1866. See also CP 222.113 14;cl902. For reference to it in the HJA see CP 6.476-77, and ms 843.63-66. 46 Ms 652.23-24;1910 &amp; ms 638.15;1909. 47 CP 6.502;cl906.</page><page sequence="18">166 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy To claim that retroduction is valid is to claim that we can catch a glimpse of G-dfs ideas and purposes. This is implied in the first prediction, the idea that we can perceive the Reason or demiurge of the cosmos, since to perceive a mind is to perceive the ideas ofthat mind: "The mind of man is adapted to mterpreting what may loosely be called the ideas of the Governor of the three worlds, ...[and] it would be folly to deny this."48 The second corollary prediction?that having grasped the hypothesis of G-d one's conduct will be shaped in such a way as to further self-control? also follows logically from the primary prediction of the G-d hypothesis that the Humble Argument will convince the normal person. The muser upon the Three Universes will perceive them as growing, and therefore interpret them semiotically as an argument, which is the only kind of sign that grows. Now an argument is not just a sign of the truth of its premises, in this case Nothing and the Ens Necessarium, but also a sign of its conclusion, in this case the Absolute Second, the complete embodiment of reason. This end is the Summum Bonum since it is what G-d and the whole universe tends toward. The muser sees that one of the laws of the Universe of Minds is that beauty, goodness, and truth will triumph: "the law of the tendency to prepotent prolificalness of spiritual excellence, whether esthetic, moral, or cognitional."49 Peirce would hold with Duns Scotus and other scholastics that Infinite Being is convertible with transcendent Beauty, Goodness, and Truth. Since these are G-d's purposes, they must become our purposes, "for nothing has any kind of value in itself?whether aesthetic, moral, or scientific?but only in its place in the whole production to which it pertains."50 We have freedom? self-control?only in so far as we will what G-d wills. It should now be more apparent why Peirce can consider the agnostic scientist never-the-less to be a believer in G-d. Such an one believes in Truth, and finds it to be a beautiful ideal for which s/he is willing to "sacrifice every ordinary motive of life." The scientist, in believing in, loving, and serving the Truth, de facto believes in, loves, and serves G-d. The Humble Argument has 48 HJAD ms 843.7. 49 HJADms8432r.l7. 50 HJA CP 6.479, cf. also CP 5.403n3; 1906.</page><page sequence="19">Vol. 16, No. 2, May 1995 167 worked upon hm/r in a sort of secular conversion.51 But this scientist may indefinitely postpone the conscious recognition that what s/he has actually been converted to is a faith in G-d.52 Self-control of action consists of self-criticism of action in accordance with ideals so as to build up correct habits. Notice that again, as with faith and the Humble Argument, there is a reflexive quality about this prediction: it is self-control replicated on self-control, our conduct in regulating our conduct, that is at issue. One does not point to a person of exemplary conduct and say "that conduct is the meaning of G-d," but one says "that certain ideals were operative in the gradual transformation by which that person improved in hs/r habits of conduct?that is the meaning of G-d." VL Detailed Exegesis of The Text A full exposition of the pragmatistic definition of Ens necessarium would require many pages; but some hints toward it may be given.53 There are six terms in the proposed Verifiable Definition of G-d that may seem problematical, and they are given in itaics below: If, for example, the predication of a given concept [1] were to lead [2] to our admitting that a given form of reasoning [3] concerning the subject [4i] of which it [4ii] was affirmed [4] was valid, when it [5] would not otherwise be 51 Ward in this issue claims that Peirce has no adequate way of handling conversion. In fact, Peirce says that conventional Christian religious conversion is a type of retroduction, or apnoristic response to the Gospel. The HJA is about a sort of natural theological analogue to dogmatic theological conversion. One can go so far as to say that it is specifically an analogue to Duns Scotus's two mode model of conversion, with the Humble Argument leading to "faith in the Being of G-d" analogous to the conversion of attrition to contrition sacramentally, and with the Third or Enclosing Argument analogous to the spontaneous conversion of attrition to contrition through progressive intensification. 52 HJA CP 6.467; HJAD ms 277. 53 HJAD CP 6.490.</page><page sequence="20">168 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy valid, the recognition [6a] ofthat effect [6b] in our reasoning would decidedly be a habit of conduct. The first of these terms, "a given concept," was given the gloss "'God' as a definable concept: "Ens necessarium" in the presentation of the definition at the beginning of this paper. Since I do not believe that anyone who reads the drafts of the the HJA, especially anyone informed that the " Additament" and its variant pages are drafts of this final section, will doubt that "God" is the concept in question, I shall not take the space to defend this interpretation. The second of the problematic term, "to lead," could be taken in two senses: a) in the Jamesian sense?instinctively, as a matter of common sense; and b) logically, after critical analysis. When one considers that the definition is filled with logical words "predication," "subject," "form of reasoning," and "valid"; when one considers the strong critique of James's idea of pragmatism in the HJA and elsewhere; and when one examines the context of the definition, in which the question of logical implication from an hypothesis has been paramount, there seems little doubt that option "b" is to be preferred. Clinching that interpretation is this statement in a draft: "the true meaning of any hypothesis lies in that unitary determination which it would impart to practical conduct under any and every conceivable circumstance, supposing this conduct to be guided by reflexion carried out to an ultimate limit." There can be no doubt given the context of the whole article that the third key phrase "a given form of reasoning" refers to retroduction. The truly problematic phrase is "the subject [4i] of which it [4ii] was affirmed." Assuming that "it" refers back to "concept" then "subject" would refer to the subject of which the concept was affirmed. The pragmatic maxim enjoins us to convert a concept into a conditional proposition in which the predicate of the antecedent is the concept to be presided and its grammatical subject is any (logical) object to which the concept might be applied. Thus the predicate is "Ens necessarium, creator of all three Universes of Experience," and its subject is G-d, the proper Name. This is as we have glossed it at the beginning of the paper. It fits with the use of the word "subject" earlier in paragraph 6.481, and it accords with Peirce's statement in his letter to Lady</page><page sequence="21">Vol. 16, No. 2, May 1995 169 Welby commenting upon the HJA that "I use 'subject' as the correlative of 'predicate.'"54 Normally, of course, it would not be possible to predicate a word of itself, except tautologically: "Red is red" or "Priscilla Mullins is Priscilla Mullins." But, uniquely, "God" is both a proper name, and hence a logical object devoid of any marks, and a concept, or logical predicate, and hence definable, as Peirce states in the first sentence of the article.55 Since a pragmatistic definition is one in terms of the "general habits of conduct a belief in the truth of the concept (of any conceivable subject, under any conceivable circumstances) would reasonably develop; that is to say, what habits would ultimately result from a sufficient consideration of such truth,"56 "G-d" qua concept, definable analytically as Ens necessarium, is definable pragmatistically in terms of the general habits of conduct which a believer of the statement "X is Ens Necessarium" would develop, "supposing this conduct to be guided by reflexion carried out to an ultimate limit."57 In the case of the concept Ens Necessarium, there is only one subject of which it may be predicated, although under an infinite number of circumstances. Such conduct would include the intellectual habit of recognizing that only by positing the Reality of an Ens Necessarium can one give rational grounds for a reliance on inspired guessing and heart perceived ideals; and thus a hope for Freedom (self-control) and for attaining the Truth. It might be argued, however, that the antecedent of "it" (4ii) is not "concept" but "a given form of reasoning," i.e., retroduction. In that case the "subject" of a "retroduction" might either be a) the thinker or rather muser who is retroducing, as in "person retroduces";58 or b) the subject retroduced about as in "John is forming hypotheses about x";59 or c) the proposition retroduced, as in "proposition x" has been retroduced. The last two alternatives are awkward, and would seem to add little to the meaning of the definition. 54 SS p.69;14/12/1908. 55 HJA CP 6.452. 56 HJA CP 6.481. 57 HJAD ms 844(s).unp. 58 Cf. SS p.76 "a...Faith which will have already taken deep root before the subject of it thinks of it as a belief." 59 Cf SS p.72 "God, the most inscrutable of any subject."</page><page sequence="22">170 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy However, the first alternative has something to be said for it. Semantically, taking "predication of a given concept" as the antecedent of "if is the most natural interpretation, since a predicate is indeed affirmed of a subject. Syntactically, on the other hand, the case is ambiguous, and "it" could take either that or, perhaps more naturally, the subject of the subordinate clause "a form of reasoning" which is closer . In this case the prediction is that retroduction is valid relative to human minds. In support of this interpretation one could cite a late passage: [I think] that it may be that the human mind is gifted with the power of comprehending the very truth about everything, or...indefinitely near to...[it...however, I think] it safer to assume that there are some things man can never discover and others that he cannot rightly comprehend. Man, according to this view, lives in a world that is partly unreal, or rather relative to his faculties, but is so completely limited to that world, that he can be said to Uve in it; and what he is ob?ged by his nature, as a man, to beheve becomes the truth relatively to that universe of his human thoughts to which his conception of the Real is Umited.60 Although such an interpretation is possible, this student of Peirce does not think that he moved definitively to such views until after January 1909, at least, and the arguments for its acceptance, semantic and syntactic, are not so strong as those for the preferred interpretation. Furthermore, the preferred meaning deepens the definition in ways that no other does. This can be seen in the sixth and last of the problematic parts of the passage, in which both the words "recognition" and "effect (i.e. that one is forced to admit..." are glossed "habitual." This foUows from the definition of the pragmatistic level of understanding given just above the Verifiable Definition. The pragmatic degree of clearness is obtained by recognition of what general habits of conduct would ultimately result from a be?ef in the truth of a concept predicated of any conceivable subject under any conceivable circumstances. Hence the idea "hard" can be predicated of the 60 Ms755:l-2;c.l911.</page><page sequence="23">Vol. 16, No. 2, May 1995 171 subject "diamond," and it would mean that as a general rule we would not be able to scratch it with a knife. In his metaphysics Peirce adopts the Aristotelian position that G-d eternally contemplates Hm/rself. We have noted the tendency to reflexivity in all the predictions that follow from the hypothesis of G-d's reality, and in the definition of "faith," which is a "belief in a belief." The pragmatistic definition of G-d that he develops is itself reflexive in two ways. First, as we just saw, the word G-d is uniquely both a definable concept and a proper name, and so is predicated of itself. Second, whereas the pragmatistic level of understanding always consists in the recognition of a habit of conduct; a pragmatistic understanding of the concept "God" consists in the recognition of a habit of recognizing a habit, where the first habit, the habit of recognizing, and the second habit, the habit of admitting, are both habits of conduct. Stated another way, to understand the concept "G-d" is to recognize that an explicit believer in G-d would recognize that s/he must, as a mental habit, logically admit the validity of retroductions about G-d, the object of a proper name.</page></plain_text>
