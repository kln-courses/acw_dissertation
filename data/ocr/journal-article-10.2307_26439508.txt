<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE REINTERPRETATION OF THE MYTHS By GILBERT HIGHET NO ONE knows when the Greek legends were created, or by whom. But they have lived for more than three thousand years, they have entered nearly all the literatures of modern Europe and the Americas, and some of them are part of our daily thought and conversation. They are far less destructible than men, or nations. Even the religion of which they were once a part has perished, and its temples are ruined; but the myths live on, with the death less youth which breathes from the statues of Apollo and his sister Artemis. At the present time, the most interesting development of classical influence in modern thought is the reinterpretation and revitalization of the Greek myths. This is going on in two different fields, and apparently in two different directions. One is almost wholly literary, and mainly dramatic. The other has produced a great deal of literature indirectly, and will produce more, but is primarily psychological and philo sophical. II For century after century men have been re-telling the Greek legends, elaborating some and neglecting others. They have sought different beauties and values in them, and, when they gave them conscious interpretations, have educed from them many different kinds of truth. However, there are three main principles on which the myths can be interpreted. One is to say that they describe single historical facts. The second is to take them as symbols of permanent philosophical truths. The third is to hold that they are reflections of natural processes, eternally recurring.</page><page sequence="2">100 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW Many of the myths are about human beings, and gods in human shape ; so they need hardly be changed to be interpret ed as accounts of historical events. This kind of interpreta tion began in Greece itself, with the brilliant Euhemeros. He explained all the legends—divine, human, and semi-hu man—as being ennobled versions of the exploits of real warriors and chiefs long ago, who had been changed into gods by their admiring tribes. And indeed, an essential part of Greco-Roman religious and political thought was the idea that men, by showing superhuman excellence, could become gods. The most famous instance was that of Hercules, who made his way up to heaven through his twelve labors and his heroic death. Alexander the Great was treated as a god during his lifetime. After his example, it was not too difficult to deify dead emperors, if they had done great serv ices to mankind, and to worship Caesar as the Saviour and the Prince of Peace. Again, some Christian writers believe that the legends about pagan divinities were really stories about the devils who went to and fro upon the earth before the birth of Christ. This is the interpretation given by Milton. In "Paradise Regained," Satan reproaches Belial for suggesting that the best way to tempt Jesus would be to "set women in his eye and in his walk" ; and he implies that the "sons of God," who the Bible says "went in unto the daughters of men," were really Belial and his companions masquerading as the Greek deities : Have we not seen, or by relation heard, In courts and regal chambers how thou lurk'st, In wood or grove, by mossy fountain-side, In valley or green meadow, to waylay Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene, Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa, Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more, Too long—then lay'st thy scapes on names adored, Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan, Satyr, or Faun, or Silvan?</page><page sequence="3">REINTERPRETATION OF MYTHS 101 Then some scholars hold that the warrior heroes, Achilles, Agamemnon, Ajax, and their peers, were personifications of warring tribes, and that their victories and deaths repre sented the conquests of one clan or another during the great migrations. Historians of religion think that many of the myths in which a god is associated with an inferior personage reflect religious revolutions, in which the worship of one deity was replaced by that of another. For example, if a divinity usually known in human shape is described as occasionally transforming himself into an animal, or killing an animal, or being accompanied by an animal, that would mean that the worship of the animal was abolished, replaced by the cult of the anthropomorphic god, and only dimly remembered. Fi nally, many legends are believed to record great inventions or advances in civilization: the "culture-hero" Dionysus or Bac chus represents the discovery of wine, Triptolemus and Hia watha the discovery of agriculture, the Argonauts the ex ploration of the unknown seas east of the Mediterranean, the Golden Fleece the wealth of the new Black Sea trade, and Prometheus the discovery of fire, metal, and the handicrafts on which civilization is built. Myths have also been thought to be symbols of important processes, either in the external world or in the soul. Max Müller, the German naturalized Englishman who was one of the founders of comparative philology, held that nearly all the myths symbolized the grandest phenomenon in the physi cal universe: the passage of the sun through the heavens every day and through the twelve signs of the zodiac every year. Thus, he interpreted almost every hero, from Hercules and his twelve labors and his flaming death to Arthur and his round table and his twelve knights, as a sun-myth. Even be fore him, C. F. Dupuis had declared that Jesus was really the sun, and his twelve disciples the signs of the zodiac. This theory is not now generally accepted. One of the books which helped to explode it was a very amusing essay by J. B. Pérès called "How Napoleon never existed"; it proves that Napo</page><page sequence="4">102 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW leon Bonaparte (whose name means "certainly Apollo, from the bona parte, the good region of the East") was really the sun, while his twelve marshals were the Ram, the Bull, the Heavenly Twins A large group of myths has been associated with the proces ses of reproduction, sexual and agricultural, and with the connection made between these two processes in the primitive mind. The leader in this field of interpretation is Sir J. G. Frazer, with "The Golden Bough." He pointed out how the mysteries of birth and death, sowing and harvest, winter and spring were reflected in the legends of Demeter and Perseph one, Venus and Adonis, Isis and Osiris. There is something of this in our own Christmas story. For there is no evidence in the Bible that Jesus was born in December; but it seems right that the infant saviour should be born about the winter solstice, to bring new life to a world apparently cold and dead. Our rejoicing round the Christmas tree is a relic of a pagan winter ritual, which used the evergreen as a symbol of the longed-for resurrection that would come in the spring. Psychologists now regard myths as expressions of per manent but unacknowledged psychical attitudes and forces. This interpretation was launched by Sigmund Freud. He pointed to the many parallels between famous and wide spread legends and the symbols which occur in dreams to represent (under an acceptable disguise) powerful instinc tive drives. And he gave a Greek legendary name to one of the most powerful, the son's love of his mother and jealousy of his father. He called it, after the tragedy of the house of Thebes, the Oedipus complex. The parallel attitude, in which the daughter loves her father and is jealous of.her mother, he called the Electra complex, because it recalls the tragedy of the princess who hated her proud, cruel mother, Clytemnestra. The self-adoration and self-absorption which may make a man or woman dead to the whole external world were first and most graphically found in the mythical youth who died for love of his reflection in a pool: so, after Narcissus, the neurosis is called narcissism.</page><page sequence="5">REINTERPRETATION OF MYTHS 103 Freud's suggestions are now being elaborated by C. G. Jung, both in his books and in the periodical Eranos, which he sponsors. The essence of this interpretation of the myths is that they are symbols of the desires and passions which all mankind feels but does not acknowledge. Girls wish to be surpassingly beautiful and to marry the richest, noblest, handsomest man in the world, who will find them in spite of the neglect and hostility of their family and their surround ings. They relieve the tension of this desire by saying that it has already come true, by retelling or rereading the story, and by identifying themselves with its heroine Cinderella. Boys wish to be the only object of their mothers' love and to expel all their competitors, of whom father is the chief. They do so by telling the story of a gallant young man who, as part of his adventurous career, kills an unknown old man who turns out to be his father, and marries a beautiful queen who turns out to be his mother. Oedipus, Cinderella, Helen of Troy, Don Juan, Robin Hood, Aladdin or Gyges, David the slayer of Goliath or Jack-the-giant-killer, Sindbad or Ulysses, Hercules or Samson or Paul Bunyan—all these characters are not so much historical individuals as projec tions of the wishes, passions, and hopes of all mankind. The great legends, and even the great symbols—such as the mystic flower and the mystic numbers three, seven, and twelve —keep recurring throughout human history and human lit erature, not only in Europe but all over the world. They are constantly being remodeled. They emerge again and again as superstitions, or foundations of great creeds, or universal pat terns of art and ritual. Jung calls them "archetypes of the collective unconscious" : patterns in which the soul of every man develops, because of the humanity he shares with every other man. Every married couple dreams of having a child which will be not imperfect, not even ordinary, but superb, the solver of all problems, good, strong, wise, heroic. This dream becomes the myth of the miraculous baby. And, in the deepest sense, the dream is true. Every baby is a miracle. According to J ung, it is because of this universality that</page><page sequence="6">104 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW the great myths can be attributed to no one author, and can be rewritten again and again without losing their power. The work done on them by many generations of taletellers and listeners is truly "collective." They represent the inmost thoughts and feelings of the human race, and therefore they are—within human standards—truly immortal. Yet we must not think that all legends are saccharine wish-fulfilments. Certainly the Greek myths are not. There is need of a book which will analyze them, tracing the mani fold relations which link them to the myths of other nations and to the more conscious art of the Greeks, and explaining how they differ from other groups of legends. One essential difference is that many of them are tragic: the stories of Narcissus, Arachne, Syrinx, Phaeton, Oedipus himself. They knew, the wise Greeks, that the realization of the extreme wishes of mankind usually leads to disaster. Cinderella lives happily ever after. But Oedipus blinds himself and goes into exile. Hercules, with his own superhuman body changed to an instrument of torture, burns himself to death. Ill Meanwhile, in literature, work of remarkable vitality has been produced by a number of modern authors who have been retelling Greek myths as plays or stories—occasionally giving them a modern setting, but more frequently retaining the ancient milieu and characters. Oddly enough, few of them actually treat the myths as symbols of the unconscious or seem to be familiar with psychological research. On the contrary, they prefer to use the legends as the Greek poets did, making them carry contemporary moral and political significance. • Although this movement has outposts in several other countries, its base is in modern France, and its activities there are by far the most fertile and interesting. Its leader is André Gide, who began as long ago as 1899 with "Philoc tetes" and "Prometheus Drops His Chains," followed by a</page><page sequence="7">REINTERPRETATION OF MYTHS 105 play, "King Candaules," on the strange legend of Gyges. He then turned to other methods of presenting the problems that obsess him, but his work continued to presuppose a classi cal outlook in his readers. In 1931 he returned to Greece with a terse and shocking drama on Oedipus; and his latest is a prose tale in the form of autobiography, "Theseus," embody ing some material from his unfinished "Considerations on Greek mythology." Not all the dramatists in the neo-Hellenic school can be called disciples of Gide; yet they have all adopted many of his attitudes to myth, transforming and sometimes distorting the legends in the same way as he does ; and they share some thing of his basic spiritual outlook. The chief plays of this group include Jean Cocteau's "Antigone," "Orpheus," and "The Infernal Machine"; Jean Giraudoux' "Amphitryon 38," "The Trojan War Will Not Take Place," and "Elec tra"; Jean Anouilh's "Orpheus," "Antigone," and "Medea"; and Jean-Paul Sartre's "The Flies." Before we consider these plays in detail, we might ask why so many modern playwrights have gone to Greek mythology for their plots. There are several different answers. First, they are in search of themes which can be treated with strong simplicity—themes which have enough authority to stand up without masses of realistic or "impressionist" detail to make them convincing. (The same tendency is ex emplified in contemporary music by Stravinsky's "Oedipus Rex," and even better in art by the paintings of Chirico and the sculptures of Maillol.) Then these themes are not only simple in outline, but pro foundly suggestive in content—and it is here that the neo Hellenic dramatists join hands with the psychologists, for they know that every great myth carries a deep significance for the men of every age, including our own. Thus» under the German occupation of France, by rehandling the legends of Antigone and Orestes, Anouilh and Sartre were able to deal with the problem of resistance to an unjust but appar</page><page sequence="8">106 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW ently irresistible authority, not only more safely but much more broadly than if they had invented a contemporary plot. Similarly, because one element of tragedy is the audience's foreknowledge of the coming disaster, there was a deeply tragic quality in Giraudoux' play showing all the efforts and sacrifices made by statesmen on both sides to avoid the Tro jan war, which was being forced on them by the passionate folly of mobs and demagogues. Since his play was produced in 1935, it was not only a Greek but a contemporary tragedy. Also, since the French intellectuals are always defending themselves against the Olympians, Gide and Cocteau and the others find a certain relief in humanizing, debunking, and even vulgarizing some of the formidable old traditions. By bringing the myths nearer to humanity, they make them more real. On the other hand, they also find the myths to be inex haustible sources of poetry. One of the gravest defects of modern drama is that it lacks imaginative power. It is quick, clever, sometimes thoughtful, always realistic. But the great dramas of the world do not stay on the ground. They leave it and become poetry. Because of the modern world's em phasis on material power and possessions, it is extremely diffi cult to write a contemporary play which will rise, at its no blest moments, into poetry; but contemporary problems, treated as versions of Greek myths, can be worked out to solutions which are poetic, whether the poetry is that of fantasy or that of tragic heroism. In form, these plays are restrained without being rigidly classical. Except for Coeteau's "The Infernal Machine," they observe the unities of time and place closely but unobtru sively, and all maintain the indispensable unity of action. They are all in completely modern prose, which in Cocteau and Giraudoux often mounts into poetic eloquence, and in both these two and the others often descends into vulgarity and slang. The chorus of Greek tragedy appears only vestigi ally: a few women talking flat prose in Gide's "Oedipus," a single commentator (like the Chorus of "Henry V") in</page><page sequence="9">REINTERPRETATION OF MYTHS 107 Anouilh's "Antigone" and Cocteau's "Antigone" (where Cocteau himself took the rôle at the first performance). But there is an interesting experiment in bridging the gap be tween audience and actors, in André Obey's "The Rape of Lucrece." A masked pair of Narrators, male and female, sit at the sides of the stage throughout the action. Sometimes they report offstage incidents, sometimes they comment on the events shown on the stage, sometimes they speak for crowds, and now and then they quote the poem of Shake speare on which the play is based: "poor bird," they say, and "poor frighted deer," pauvre biche effrayée, which is changed in the last words of the drama to pauvre biche égorgée, "poor slaughtered deer." The plots are almost always the same in outline as the myths on which they are based. They could scarcely be differ ent. It would be ridiculous to write a play proving that Julius Caesar was not assassinated, or that Troy was never captured and burnt. What can be done, though, is to take the story of Caesar's murder or the fall of Troy, and give it new implica tions, explain the facts in an odd and interesting way, cast strange lights on the characters involved, and, by remodel ing values, motives, and results, to emphasize the infinite uncertainty and complexity of human life. Every writer who attempts to create anything alive on a basis of myth must add, or subtract, or alter. One distinguished French novelist has destroyed, or in verted, a very famous legend—not because he dislikes Greek and Roman poetry but because he prefers nature to statu esque heroism. This is the Provençal writer Jean Giono, who tells us in his autobiography that the discovery of Vergil was a revelation as blinding for him as a religious conversion. He has written several works designed to recapture in prose the pastoral and animistic richness he feels in classical litera ture. In his "Birth of the Odyssey" he tells the story of the return of Odysseus, situates it in a fertile countryside more like southern France than barren Ithaca, and reduces the</page><page sequence="10">108 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW hero himself to a nervous and aging liar, who invented the stories about the Cyclops, and Scylla and Charybdis, and so forth, merely in order to account for the years he spent en route living with bewitching women like Circe, and to com pensate for his shabbiness and timidity as he approaches his home. His yarns are picked up by a blind old guitarist, who makes them into new ballads and sings them round the coun tryside. The details of this story are carefully calculated to be anti heroic. For instance, Odysseus is terribly afraid of Antinous, the strong young athlete with whom his wife Penelope has been living in adultery ; but, getting into an argument, he hits Antinous by accident, puts him to flight, chases him, and sees him caught in a landslide that throws him mutilated into the sea. Hence the tale that Odysseus killed all the suitors of Penelope. Instead of the faithful old dog Argus, a pet mag pie recognizes the returning Odysseus ; but, to avoid being de tected by Antinous, he crushes it to death. In one version of the legend, he was at last killed unwittingly by his own son— not Telemachus, but Circe's child Telegonus. Giono's book ends with the rebellious Telemachus preparing to murder his father in cold blood. Although the story is ingenious and the descriptions vivid, the inversion of the heroic saga of Odysseus is pretty artificial. Such an unsubtle and pacific character would never even have regained his home, far less fought successfully through ten years of war at Troy. Apart from this instance, the modern French taletellers and playwrights keep the outlines of the legends; but they rehandle them in such a way as to bring out unexpected truths. For instance, there is not much authority for believing that Hector and Odysseus made a concerted effort to avert the Trojan war by negotiation, but were forced into it by unknown hotheads ; yet it is certainly plausible that the two cautious heroes should have planned for peace rather than for war. And although Giraudoux, in inventing a blustering militarist and an excited propagandist to precipitate the con</page><page sequence="11">REINTERPRETATION OF MYTHS 109 flict, has created characters more appropriate to modern Ger many and France than to Bronze Age Greece, the anachro nism does not vitiate the main truth he is conveying. Anouilh's "Orpheus" is unlike most of the others, because it is entirely modern in setting and yet almost unintelligible without knowledge of the myth. The story is that Eurydice, wife of the master musician Orpheus, died suddenly; that he, by the power of his music, gained entrance to the world of the dead and was allowed to bring Eurydice back—on con dition that he would not look at her before they reached the living world; that he forgot his promise, lost her forever, and wandered about in despair until he was torn to pieces by the savage maenads of Thrace. In Anouilh's play, Orpheus is a café violinist who meets a touring actress in a railway station, and falls in love with her, but loses her when he insists on questioning her about her previous lovers. She is given back to him by a mysterious Monsieur Henri (who would be quite meaningless if he were not understood as part of the Greek myth) on condition that he shall not look her in the face until morning. But he asks her again for the whole truth, and stares her in the face, and loses her again in death. His failure is a symbol of the fact, worked out in such detail by Proust, that a lover cannot keep from trying to find out everything about his sweetheart's life, even if it will kill their love. In Gide's cynical little story, "Prometheus Drops His Chains," Prometheus has left the crag on which he was cruci fied ; but he still keeps his eagle as a pet, and feeds it on his own vitals. Why? Because he likes to see it looking handsome ; and because he, like each of us, enjoys having a private eagle, not hanging round his neck like a dead albatross, but loving him and living on his heart's blood. And Gide's "Oedipus" —in which one of Oedipus' sons writes a book closely corres ponding to works written by two of Gide's disciples, and where the Sphinx is only the monstrous enigma of life, intim idating every youth, but ready to disappear as soon as the youth answers its riddle with the word "man" (that is, by</page><page sequence="12">110 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW asserting that human nature creates its own standards) — surely this play, in which everyone is corrupt but proud, is a reflex of Gide himself and of the corrupt but proud children of his spirit. Of all these neo-Hellenic works, Giraudoux' "Amphitryon 38" is the richest in its power of revealing un expected truths about great subjects: the love of husband and wife, the power of any woman over any man (even a god in man's disguise), and the relation of man and the gods. All these playrights are good psychologists ; and they have all discovered new and yet credible motives for the actions recorded in mythical tradition. In his autobiography of Theseus, Gide says that when Ariadne gave him a thread to guide him back out of the monster-haunted labyrinth, she was really trying to attach him to herself; that this was why he later abandoned her on a desert island; and that, when he "forgot" to hoist the white sails which would tell his father he was safe (thus indirectly causing his father's suicide and his own accession to the throne), he did not really forget, any more than he forgot Ariadne on Naxos. In the same book Oedipus says that he put out his eyes, not to punish himself, but to punish them for not seeing what they ought to have seen. Creon is usually the typical harsh tyrant ; but in An ouilh's "Antigone" he explains very coolly and patiently that, so far from being cruel, he is merely an administrator of law and order and efficient government, an ideal nobler than any individual's private code of morals. Yes, and after the trag edy, after Antigone has hanged herself, after Creon's own son has denounced him and killed himself, after his own wife has cut her throat, he only sighs heavily and goes off to do his duty by presiding at a Cabinet meeting: a death as complete, though not as tragic, as those of the others. The most striking reinterpretation of motives, if not the deepest, is in Cocteau's "The Infernal Machine," where the Sphinx, although a deity vastly more powerful than the arrogant young Oedipus, tells him her secret because he has charmed the human part of her, but, as Nemesis, looks on with pity at the fulfilment of his</page><page sequence="13">REINTERPRETATION OF MYTHS 111 burning ambition, the ambition favored by the gods: that he shall supplant his father, and win the kingdom, and marry his mother, and, after the fuse has burnt down to the explo sive, be shattered in the ruins of his own strength. "They kill us for their sport." André Gide, a recent Nobel Prize-winner, stands apart from all the others as an inventor of repulsive new episodes and vicious motives. For more than two thousand years men have rehearsed the awful history of the Labdacids ; but Gide was the first to suggest that the sons born of Oedipus' un knowing incest were deliberately, and not without success, trying to seduce their sisters. The story of Candaules and Gyges, as told by Herodotus (and retold by Gautier), is spicy enough: the king is so proud of his wife's beauty that he hides his vizier Gyges in the bedroom to watch her undressing. But Gide makes the king, in a phenomenal access of gen erosity, leave the room and tell Gyges to substitute for him that night. Theseus, in the legend, carried off both Ariadne and her sister Phaedra. But Gide says that he told Ariadne he had taken a fancy to her young brother, that she connived at her brother's corruption, and that Phaedra was then smuggled aboard in the disguise of the disappointed boy. Bad taste on Gide's level, like Nero's poetry or Gaudi's architecture, is as difficult to achieve as good taste, and is at least as rare. Theseus is not the most attractive of mythical champions, but Gide gives him that peculiarly cynical type of sexual im morality which most of Gide's heroes carry as proudly as an oriflamme. "I never like leaving a desire unsatisfied," he says as he turns from one sister to another; " it is unhealthy." And even Ariadne's scarf, which lovers of poetry have always known as a pathetic token of her betrayal and her loneliness, the scarf with which she waft her love to come again to Naxos —Gide has succeeded, consciously or unconsciously, in defiling even that slight thing. In his story it blows off Ariadne's head, and is picked up by Theseus, who at once, and publicly, wraps it around him as a loincloth.</page><page sequence="14">112 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW All these authors are eager to keep their plays from being remote, archaic, unreal. Therefore, although they do not de liberately put anachronisms on the stage, they make the lan guage as modern as they can, and frequently lapse into vul garities of detail and expression. In Giraudoux' "Electra" an angry wife talks of having to light her husband's cigars and filter his coffee. Helen of Troy, like a modern French woman, says Paris may desert her for a while "to play bowls or fish for eels." In Sophocles' "Antigone" there is a sentry who reports Antigone's crime in comparatively blunt and simple language; but in Anouilh's "Antigone" there are sev eral sentries, and they accentuate the lonely virginal idealism of the heroine by very coarse conversations about getting drunk and going to a brothel. In Cocteau's "Orpheus" the poet is torn to pieces because he submits in a poetry competi tion the oracular phrase "Madame Eurydice Reviendra Des Enfers," the initial letters of which form the commonest French obscenity. Gide (except in his early "Philoctetes") tries deliberately to be banal, because he thinks heroics are false while banality is real. One example will be enough. After Oedipus discovers his sin and rushes out to blind himself, Gide makes the chorus remain on stage. Instead of keeping silence or chanting a song of pity and terror, it breaks out into infuriatingly trivial comments : "It's all just a family affair: nothing to do with us . . . He's made his bed, and now he's got to lie in it." But in spite of such eccentricities, the best of these plays are very fine, and even the worst of them contain striking and memorable thoughts. Tragedy must rise above the realities of every day, upon the wings of imagination and emotion. The great tragedians have known this necessity, and have used many means of fulfilling it: vivid descriptions like the beacon speech in Aeschylus' "Agamemnon" ; striking stage-pictures like the storm in "King Lear" and the sleeping Furies in "The Eumenides" ; symbols like the crimson carpet in "Agamem</page><page sequence="15">REINTERPRETATION OF MYTHS 113 non," the jester's skull in "Hamlet," the hand-washing in "Macbeth"; metrical richness, both dramatic and lyrical; physical suffering like that of Prometheus, Philoctetes, Orestes, Othello, Gloucester, Phèdre; and, above all, super natural appearances—omens, divinities, spirits of health, or goblins damned. Yielding to the decline in taste and the con traction of imagination, most modern playwrights do not even attempt such bold effects : or, if ever, do so awkwardly and unconvincingly. However, the French neo-Hellenic dramatists, stimulated by the example of their predecessors and strengthened by the myths which they are using (or which are using them), employ several of these effects to en noble their work. A powerful new symbol for the sense of guilt which is basically weakness and cowardice was created by Sartre in "The Flies," when he showed the blood-guilty city of Argos infested with a plague of fat black blowflies, and the Furies themselves threatening Orestes in the shape of monstrous bloodsucking flies. Flies annoy, and weaken, and in swarms even terrify, but they rarely kill. With energy and decision, by killing some and driving others away and ignoring the rest, one can survive. "The Flies" was produced when France was occupied by the Germans. Again, in Cocteau's "The Infernal Machine," Jocasta, the pitiful, nervous, but still beautiful queen, enters leading Tiresias, the blind seer who foresees her tragedy. Her scarf trails behind her, and Tiresias treads on it. She cries: "I am surrounded by things that hate me ! This scarf has been choking me all day. It hooks onto branches, it rolls itself around axles, and now you tread on it.... It's terrifying! It will kill me." That is indeed the scarf with which she hangs herself ; and in the last scene she appears (visible only to the blinded eyes of Oedipus) with it bound around her neck. In the same play, the wedding of Oedipus and his mother is treated with masterly tact and imagination. The couple, left</page><page sequence="16">114 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW alone in the bridal chamber, are exhausted by the coronation ceremonies, the long processions, the heavy robes : they move and live half-asleep in an uneasy dream. Oedipus falls asleep just as he has thrown himself down to rest, across the mar riage-bed, his tired head lolling over the foot of it. And his head rests on the empty cradle (once his own) which Jocasta kept in memory of the child she lost ; and then, as he sleeps, she rocks the cradle. The authority of legend makes it easier for a playwright to introduce the supernatural in a mythical play than in a contemporary drama. The French dramatists are not as a rule content with imitating the traditional appearances of supernatural beings in Greek drama. They prefer to give their creations new forms. The flies of Sartre are one such creation. The Furies also appear in Giraudoux' "Electra" : as little girls who gradually grow into maidens and then into tall powerful women, while the revenge of Orestes ap proaches its maturity. In the same play, a vulture is seen in the last act, at first floating very high above the head of the doomed Aegisthus, and then gradually, gradually planing lower. Cocteau's "Orpheus" is really a surrealist extrava ganza, clever but silly. However, it contains one impressive deity: Death. Neither a crowned phantom nor a winged angel, she appears as a beautiful impassive young woman, who puts on a surgeon's white coat and mask, and, while her patient Eurydice is dying, directs the manipulation of ma chines as intricate and terrifying as those of modern hospitals. No horseman, no skeleton reaper could be so effective for today. But the most impressive of all these figures is the Sphinx in Cocteau's "The Infernal Machine." At first only a girl whom young Oedipus meets on the road, she changes into a winged monster, half-woman, half-lioness ; and the proud hero falls before her, bewitched and aghast. Much might be said of the eloquence of Giraudoux, who wrote exquisite prose, and whose characters talk in flashingly vivid images, following the French dramatic tradition of</page><page sequence="17">REINTERPRETATION OF MYTHS 115 raisonnement, brilliant disquisitions on abstract themes. If anything, his characters do discuss too much. But Giraudoux and Cocteau are the only two of these writers whose style reaches real splendor at great moments. One example will suffice. When Oedipus falls before the Sphinx, he is para lyzed. He shouts "I will resist!" And she replies: It is useless to close your eyes, to turn your head away. My power does not lie in my gaze nor in my song. When I act, I am defter than a blind man's fingers, swifter than a gladiator's net, subtler than the lightning, stiffer than a char ioteer, heavier than a cow, more dutiful than a schoolboy wrinkling his brows over a sum, more rigged and sailed and anchored and balanced than a ship, more incorruptible than a judge, greedier than the insects, bloodier than the birds, more nocturnal than an egg, more ingenious than an Oriental torturer, more deceitful than the heart, more supple than the hand of a thief, more fateful than the stars, more diligent than the snake as it moistens its prey with saliva; I can secrete and produce and abandon and wind and ravel and unravel so that when I will these knots of mine they are tied, and when I think them they are tightened or loosened ; so delicate that you cannot grasp them, so pliant that you feel them like a creeping poison, so hard that if I let them slip they would maim you, so taut that a bow could draw a note of divine anguish from the bond between us; clamped like the sea, like the pillar, like the rose, thewed like the octopus, complicated like the mechanics of a dream, invisible above all else, invisible and majestic like the blood in the veins of a statue, a thread binding you in the multiple swirls and twists of a stream of honey falling into a cup of honey. We began this essay by asking why these playwrights chose Greek legends for their subjects. The central answer is that the myths are permanent. They deal with the greatest of all problems, the problems which do not change, because men and women do not change. They deal with love; with war; with sin; with tyranny; with courage; with fate: and all in some way or other deal with the relation of man to those divine powers which are sometimes felt to be irrational, sometimes to be cruel, and sometimes, alas, to be just.</page></plain_text>
