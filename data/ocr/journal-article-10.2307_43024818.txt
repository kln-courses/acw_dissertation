<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID COPLAND MORRIS University of Washington, Tacoma A Dog's Life: Anthropomorphism, Sentimentality, and Ideology in John Muir's Stickeen John Muir is well-recognized as a founder of the American environmental movement. However, his important and original writing has only recently begun to be appreciated. His books, long difficult to obtain, are now available in uniform paperback editions, and his work is drawing increased critical attention. It is worth not- ing, however, that as of this writing neither the mainstream Norton Anthology of American Literature, nor the much-touted, revisionist Heath Anthology of American Literature, contain any of his writing. For anyone with more than a passing acquaintance with Muir's work, this omission is simply amazing. Indeed, the anthologies list- ed above are guilty of omitting a huge body of what might be called nature or environmental writing. Nowhere is there to be found any work by Edward Abbey, Annie Dillard, Loren Eiseley, Barry Lopez, Aldo Leopold or Wendell Berry. One can dimly imagine arguments (however weak) for not including these writers, but Muir is a figure of major importance in American culture outside of literary history, and is also, in my view, very often a brilliant stylist. A good place to begin in remedying the anthologies' sad defi- ciencies would be the short narrative Stickeen which exhibits Muir at his most energetic and ambitious. Ronald Limbaugh relates: "Muir told his friends that Stickeen was the hardest story he had ever composed" (27). Limbaugh goes on to argue:</page><page sequence="2">140 Western American Literature All of Muir's creative energies went into the writing of Stickeen. What began as a simple adventure story - the kind R. U. Johnson [the editor] had in mind for Century - ended in a profoundly moving nar- rative, a classic commentary on the rights of animals and their place in nature. (27) I endorse Limbaugh's large claim for Stickeen, but I think even he limits what might be claimed by the way he phrases it. Stickeen is really a challenge to the entire humanist perspective on con- sciousness. Specifically, Muir calls into question one of the most deeply seated ideas in Western culture, namely that there is an unbridgeable chasm of difference between human and animal con- sciousness. Muir's attack on this idea is part of his larger project of expressing and supporting a belief in the inherent value of the non- human world, a belief at the foundation of any environmental ethic. He writes: Why should man value himself as more than a small part of the one great unit of creation? And what creature of all that the Lord has taken the pains to make is not essential to the completeness of that unit - the cosmos? The universe would be incomplete without man; but it would also be incomplete without the smallest transmicroscop- ic creature that dwells beyond our conceitful eyes and knowledge. (WW 317) The notion of unbridgeable difference in consciousness has seri- ously distorted our understanding of human and animal mentality, as well as of the human place in the natural world. And this distor- tion has obstructed our understanding of what ethical treatment of animals might be. But those who call this notion of difference into question have often been criticized for sentimentality and anthropomorphism. The deep ideological commitment on the part of some to the absolutely firm dividing line is evidenced (among many other examples) by the exceedingly hostile reception given to the work of researchers into animal language capabilities. It is true that some of this research was vulnerable to methodological critique, but the intensi- ty and virulence of the attack was as characteristic of a religious</page><page sequence="3">David Copland Morris 141 feud as of a scientific dispute. Some of that same ideological flavor can be seen in the response in some quarters to Stickeen, a story that effectively dramatizes the heretical idea that the line between human and animal is much fainter than usually thought. Predictably, the story has been called sentimental because of its supposed anthropomorphism. A very recent biography brings the old accusation up to date: Stickeen does "not escape a touch of sen- timentality, with Muir over-anthropomorphizing Stickeen, so that he would be charged with 'nature-faking' by certain of his oppo- nents" (Wilkins 150). In other words, some critics imply that read- ers care deeply about the fate of the dog Stickeen and admire aspects of his behavior largely because Muir falsely and sentimen- tally attributes human qualities to the animal. Even one of Muir's most eloquent, sympathetic and sensitive contemporary critics, Michael Cohen, while defending the story, hedges his discussion of it with defensive language aimed at warding off charges of senti- mentality. We find him saying, "Even if this dog story was a tale for children . . ." (346), and " Stickeen is a sentimental but thoughtful dog story . . ." (349). In my view, there is no need to be apologetic, for the charge of sentimentality is mistaken, and in exploring the origin and nature of such a charge we can arrive at a more just appreciation of the great value of the narrative. The charge derives in part from a longstand- ing cultural pattern of flawed attempts to explain or account for the consciousness of animals. These attempts tend to coalesce around two equally inadequate positions. The first, exemplified in the reductive thought of René Descartes, asserts that animals are sim- ply mechanisms who do not, in fact, experience any emotion at all. The second position, apparent in truly sentimental representations such as, say, Disney cartoons, suggests that animal consciousness is almost identical with that of human beings. Stickeen is remarkable because it provides a compelling image of animal consciousness which depends on neither of these weak positions. Instead, Muir describes the dog in a manner which tries neither to explain away human-like emotions, nor to attribute human emotions when there is no evidence for doing so. In taking this tack, Muir's narrative</page><page sequence="4">142 Western American Literature method anticipates the open-minded, revolutionary approach to studying animal behavior of researchers such as Jane Goodall. His method also anticipates the most insightful, to my mind, of con- temporary philosophical analyses of animal consciousness, that of philosopher Mary Midgley. In Stickeen, Muir observes and analyzes in a way that Midgley would approve: that is, with great flexibility and care. His narrative constitutes an important effort toward understanding consciousness across difference. It will be instructive, I think, to examine more closely the thought of Descartes on the difference between animal and human consciousness, for he added to the already negative Christian atti- tude that animals had no souls the rationalist prejudice that they had no consciousness. As the "father" of modern philosophy, his views have had great influence throughout the culture. They both helped create and reflected the paradigmatic ideology against which Muir was protesting when he wrote Stickeen. Descartes, while espousing a starting point for his philosophy in a supposedly strict skepticism devoid of any bias, nonetheless asserts that the dividing line between human and animal conscious- ness is so great that animals cannot even be said to feel pain. (I am following Peter Singer's discussion here.) According to Singer, "although they may squeal when cut with a knife, or writhe in their efforts to escape contact with a hot iron, this does not, Descartes said, mean that they feel pain in this situation" (200). And Singer relates: "Descartes himself dissected living animals in order to advance his knowledge of anatomy" (201). Descartes's attitude became widespread during his lifetime. The following is an account of animal experimentation performed in his era where the experimenters invoke the Cartesian metaphysical principles in order to justify their behavior: They administered beatings to dogs with perfect indifference, and made fun of those who pitied the creatures as if they felt pain. They said the animals were clocks; that the cries they emitted when struck were only the noise of a little spring that had been touched, but that the whole body was without feeling. They nailed poor animals up on</page><page sequence="5">David Copland Morris 143 boards by their four paws to vivisect them and see the circulation of the blood which was a great subject of conversation. (201-2) Now if the tenor of Descartes's views could merely be con- signed to an earlier era, it would be more comforting. But such is not the case. An extremely ambitious and impressive effort has been made by contemporary philosopher Suzanne Langer to rethink the relationship between human and animal consciousness in her mon- umental work entitled Mind : An Essay on Human Feeling . Unfortunately, Langer is fully armed with the Cartesian prejudices before she even begins. I quote her preface at length in order to con- vey the almost religious intensity with which she believes in the sharp, Cartesian line between human and animal mentality: The central problem of the present essay is the nature and origin of the veritable gulf that divides human from animal mentality, in a per- fectly continuous course of development of life on earth that has no breaks. For animals have mental functions, but only man has a mind, and a mental life. Some animals are intelligent, but only man can be intellectual. The thesis I am about to develop here is that his depar- ture from the normal pattern of animal mentality is a vast and special evolution of feeling in the hominid stock (Vol. 1, xvi). For in one pri- mate stock - the hominid stock - all the developments of special tal- ents seem to have tended in one general direction, which was toward cerebral activity; and at some fateful juncture in the history of that genus, there occurred a shift - doubtless long-prepared - of a system- atically and practically unimportant cerebral function that took all related ones along, somewhat as the turn of a milometer that has reached 99,999.9, starting with the decimal figure, replaces one 9 after another by 0, until at the left end of the line a new space is filled by a "1": 1,000,000.0. Such was the great shift, the shift from animal to human estate, that initiated the development of mind. (1: 444) The great shift which Langer cites seems almost a metaphor for the biblical shift from primordial chaos to the advent of light. Rhetoric this loaded is the mark of ideology, not open-minded inquiry. The tenor of Muir's ideas is strikingly different from that of Langer or Descartes. Muir protests: "We seek to establish a narrow line between ourselves and the feathery zeroes we dare to call</page><page sequence="6">144 Western American Literature angels, but ask a partition barrier of infinite width to show the rest of creation its proper place." And: From the dust of the earth, from the common elementary fund, the Creator has made Homo sapiens. From the same material he has made every other creature, however noxious and insignificant to us. They are earth-bound companions and our fellow mortals. The fearfully good, the orthodox, of this laborious patch-work of modern civiliza- tion cry "Heresy" on every one whose sympathies reach a single hair's breadth beyond the boundary epidermis of our own species. (WW 317) Now these are powerful, eloquently stated ideas, but general- izations are not entirely adequate to the task of altering firmly held beliefs. However, the belief in the sharp human-animal dividing line may not be as widely adhered to in cultural practice as it may sometimes appear. The inability of the current dominant ideas about animals in our culture to accommodate emotions that are actually felt can be partly seen in an interesting syndrome described recent- ly in the news media. Support groups have been formed for people experiencing grief over the death of a pet. The problem for most people was that while they were truly bereaved, they were also embarrassed by the emotions they were feeling and certainly embarrassed to reveal them to others. An illuminating point to be drawn, I think, is that there is no language in which the feelings could be expressed without running the risk of seeming comical. Animals present one of those messy cases where the rules of the culture aren't coherent. The work of Mary Midgley suggests that one of the reasons for this messiness may lie in an addiction to a philosophically insup- portable belief in the absolute metaphysical difference between ani- mal and human. Too many philosophers assert that there is reason and there is instinct, and there is nothing in between. But Midgley draws on the notion (derived from current work in the philosophy of mind) that all we can know about the consciousness of another being is what we can infer from the behavior of that being. The processes for understanding human and animal minds, she claims,</page><page sequence="7">David Copland Morris 145 are therefore quite similar: we carefully observe the behavior of the organism in question, and then we place that behavior in an appro- priate and meaningful context. The main problem with the received notion about a sharp line between animal and human is that it is based not on careful observation and thoughtful analysis, but rather on unexamined, uncriticized presuppositions drawn from folklore, myth, and sloppy or biased science. Midgley gently understates: "Philosophers have not yet made much use of informed comparison with other species as a help in the understanding of man" (4). The emphasis should be on the word informed , for philosophers have always had the best of both worlds; they defined humanity in rela- tion to animals, always to the benefit of humanity, and always with an ignorance of animals. It is not surprising that despite their igno- rance, philosophers felt compelled to make the comparison, for, as Midgley points out, it is not an optional one: Understanding is relating; it is fitting things into a context. Nothing can be understood on its own. Had we known no other animate life- form than our own, we should have been utterly mysterious to our- selves as a species. And that would have made it immensely harder for us to understand ourselves as individuals. (18) Thus, in well-known formulations, Aristotle says that man is the rational animal, and Wittgenstein says that if a lion could talk, we could not understand him; but neither Aristotle nor Wittgenstein possessed accurate information about animals. We can be sure that neither possessed a fraction of the knowledge available today about animal behavior in the wild. However, both were complacently cer- tain they knew what they were talking about. Indeed, one may sur- mise that accuracy of information about animals was not an issue in either philosopher's mind; the animal was simply an abstraction which functioned as one pole in a binary opposition. The main result of viewing things from Midgley's more flexible perspective is this: if we view consciousness in animals as similar to our own (in that we can often infer comprehensible intention and motivation), we can see our own consciousness and even morality as other than an alien, accidental entity in the universe. From this</page><page sequence="8">146 Western American Literature perspective, for example, parents protect and educate and sacrifice for their children in part - in large part - because it is the mam- malian thing to do, not simply because it conforms to an abstract moral injunction. Morality at best encourages patterns of behavior which are ingrained in many mammals. So, for example, wolves not only exhibit what we would call conscious behavior, but there is a perspective from which it is plausible to think of the behavior as moral also. Certainly it is fair to say we admire the behavior of wolves as parents, that it is not at all absurd to think of them as good parents. In Jane Goodall's studies of chimps it is impossible to come away without thinking that some of them are simply good par- ents, and some are not, in a way that very closely parallels how we make judgments about human parents. Goodall herself tries not to "anthropomorphize," but simply attempts to observe similarities between human and animal behavior. When she sees such similari- ties she does not refrain from concluding that the motivations behind similar behavior might be similar as well. There is no reason to presuppose animal mentality as radically different from human. In fact, to insist on this is to be unscientific since such a presuppo- sition conflicts with observable cases. We will be unlikely to learn much about animal consciousness, though, by starting from a position like that of Langer, whose almost perverse methodological biases are nicely embodied in the following words: "The best way to gain some understanding of the mentality of various high and low animals is ... to discover step by step how their acts call our anthropomorphic image of their lives in question" (2: 105). In our attempt to learn something about animal mentality, it would be more fruitful to turn our attention to the nar- rative of Stickeen where Muir describes a starting point diametri- cally opposed to that of Langer: "But there is no estimating the wit and wisdom concealed and latent in our fellow mortals until made manifest by profound experiences; for it is through suffering that dogs as well as saints are developed and made perfect" (S 17). Stickeen recounts one of those profound experiences. For those unfamiliar with the narrative, I will provide a short synopsis, emphasizing the key experiences Muir alludes to above. In 1880, he</page><page sequence="9">David Copland Morris 147 was exploring Alaskan glaciers with several companions, one of whom brought along a small mixed-breed dog named Stickeen who attached himself after a time to Muir. One day in late August Muir sets out in the early morning to go exploring in the heart of a storm, and the dog, who has been accustomed to accompany him on his rambles, goes along. Late in the afternoon, the storm worsens and they become lost among the crevasses of the glacier, finally reach- ing a point where the only possible way to safety entails traversing an extremely treacherous snowbridge about forty feet in length and some eight or ten feet below the lips of the crevasse. Muir meticu- lously cuts steps in the ice and then inches his way across the bridge and up the other side; he finds it the most demanding test of his entire extraordinary mountaineering life. Then Stickeen must attempt the trip. During Muir's acquain- tance with the dog, the animal had endured all manner of hardship without any complaint at all; indeed he had shown himself to be "concealed, independent, invincibly quiet" (5 7). Now, however, he whines and cries and shows tremendous distress. After Muir coaxes and cajoles him for a long time, Stickeen slides down the steps Muir has cut, proceeds to slowly and delicately pick his way across the ice bridge, and then, to Muir's amazement, after an agonizing peri- od of hesitation, rushes up the opposite slope in a blur. There follows a scene of ecstatic joy as Stickeen races back and forth hundreds of yards at a time in seeming delirium. The two com- panions then continue back to camp, reaching it about ten at night, cold, drenched and barely alive. Muir's biographer describes the scene: At ten o'clock, when [Muir's companions] had almost given up hope, Muir emerged from the darkness. Stickeen, who was wont to come bounding in, ready to wolf down his food, this time walked feebly like a little shadow at his chosen master's feet. Spurning the meat Joe held out to him, he crept away to his blanket in the tent. And Muir, who usually strolled in, a rapt fey look in his eyes as of an inner radi- ance shining out, bursting to relate the day's events, now staggered with weakness, his eyes dazed with exhaustion. He said 'Yon's a brave doggie.' (Wolfe 219-20)</page><page sequence="10">148 Western American Literature This is the bare outline of events; but the narrative is really a subtle and sensitive exploration of consciousness across difference. It is a kind of "cross-species" investigation of character. Midgley says that no one reading the more advanced studies of animal behavior such as that of Jane Goodall can possibly interpret such behavior in simple terms of stimulus and response. This is true of Stickeen also. Midgley draws the following conclusions after exten- sively studying animal behavior studies. All this [animal] behavior is active ; it is not in the least like getting caught in a snare; it will not break down into passive stimulus- response patterns. It is not mechanical but purposive, and the purpose is linked to lasting character traits expressing priorities. (279) In Stickeen we end up feeling we have seen the dog's character test- ed and revealed in a way not too much different from the way Muir himself is tested and revealed. I want to focus on one aspect of this process that I think is cen- tral. Muir movingly evokes the emotional responses of both himself and Stickeen to the threat of death. Cohen and Limbaugh both see that crevasse functioning symbolically as a valley of death, and the crossing of the ice bridge as the center of meaning in the narrative. But Cohen says: Stickeen is a sentimental but thoughtful dog story, and Muir did not mean to transcend the conventions of his chosen genre when he wrote it. Its message is straightforward. "Through him," said Muir, "as through a window I have ever since been looking with deeper sympa- thy into all my fellow mortals." (349) Cohen does not say which features of the narrative he finds senti- mental and which thoughtful, but he implies that the more thought- ful part has to do with Muir' s introspection; the analysis of the dog's consciousness and behavior is seen as sentimental and uno- riginal. The thoughtful element is described by Cohen this way:</page><page sequence="11">David Copland Morris 149 But the story was also about Muir himself, about the rebirth of the boy in him who was frightened by danger, and joyous when he had passed over. As Muir turned the focus of the narrative onto the dog, and through the dog back onto himself, he was beginning to look back on his own experiences with a more critical eye and ask whether such adventures really had been valuable. Why was it better to live life and risk death in the mountains? (349) Cohen's reading is sensitive and persuasive, but Limbaugh's exten- sive research among the Muir papers shows that Muir did in fact mean to transcend the genre of the "dog story." Indeed, Muir con- tinually resisted efforts of the magazine editor to reduce the account to formula. Muir wanted it to be a serious evaluation of animal con- sciousness which would contribute to the post-Darwinian debates on the subject that he followed with tremendous interest (Limbaugh 34-41). Limbaugh is led to a more comprehensive claim for Stickeen than that made by Cohen: If the [ice] bridge was the connecting link between the species, the abyss symbolized the dark unknown, the void of superstition and fear that separates human from other life forms. Bridging the gap repre- sented not only oneness and immortality - a uniting of souls in a spir- itual victory over death - it also signified a "triumphant joy of deliv- erance" over the netherworld of ignorance that prevented mankind from recognizing its physical and spiritual kinship with the rest of creation. Leaving the void behind was symbolic affirmation of the human-animal bond. (41) It seems to me that a narrative performing such a significant cultur- al function certainly deserves inclusion in prominent anthologies of American literature. But Limbaugh does not really explain why the narrative is successful, he asserts it. To a skeptic who would find the accounts of Stickeen's motives and consciousness sentimental, Limbaugh's article would only be interesting intellectual history. I want to try to analyze now how Stickeen makes itself into a major work. It does so, I would argue, by its choice of the threat of death as the common experience it focuses on, and by the way in</page><page sequence="12">150 Western American Literature which it carefully links its conclusions about animal consciousness to observations about animal behavior. The topic of death is crucial because having the concept of death is held by philosophers to be one of the distinguishing marks of the human. Having a sense of mortality takes us out of the immediate moment and places us in a kind of double existence marked by a notion of negation, a notion of non-being. It is this notion of non-being always lurking on the edges of existence which partly humanizes us. In Stickeen, Muir implies that something very like this notion can exist in non-human animals. In the narrative, the reader is first presented with Muir's own thoughts in the face of imminent death. During his adventure with Stickeen, Muir's constitutionally positive stance toward life is put to an extreme test, and he shows the depth of his own character by the honesty of his account: How I got up that cliff I never could tell. The thing seemed to have been done by somebody else. I never have held death in contempt, though in the course of my explorations I have oftentimes felt that to meet one's fate on a noble mountain, or in the heart of a glacier, would be blessed as compared with death from disease, or from some shabby lowland accident. But the best death, quick and crystal-pure, set so glaringly open before us, is hard enough to face, even though we feel gratefully sure that we have already had happiness enough for a dozen lives. (5 54-55). Coming, as it does, after his enthusiastic embrace of all the dan- gerous day had to offer, Muir's confession is especially moving. In making it, he recognizes the limits of his optimistic and transcen- dental philosophy. When looking at the face of death, the existen- tial loneliness of the individual organism is foregrounded - Muir was terrified. Can an animal share to some degree that peculiar ter- ror and loneliness? Deciding the issue is tricky, but not impossible. Midgley asserts: Solipsists apart, most of us would be ready to accept that we can know something about human feelings. Ought we to hesitate about</page><page sequence="13">David Copland Morris 151 extending this ability to our contacts with animals? Do we really not know what they feel? We have, it seems, a choice here. As with other skeptical sugges- tions, we can simply proclaim that we know nothing - and then try not to use the powers we have disclaimed. Or we can use them and see where they take us. (347) The fact is, Midgley says further, that difference in species is not philosophically significant in the act of interpretation: "The species barrier is, in itself, irrelevant. Members of one species do in fact often succeed in understanding members of another well enough for both prediction and a personal bond. Nothing more is necessary" (348). She concludes: In sum, whether, and how far, interspecies communication works for feelings and motives is an empirical question. On the whole it does. That it does is not surprising given our evolutionary relationship, and the fact that it could be quite dangerous to misconstrue the behavior of creatures outside one's species, and quite convenient to read it. (350) Supposedly hard-headed, unsentimental observers unfailingly urge caution against the specter of "anthropomorphism," but Midgley cautions against the opposite: an unreasoning skepticism. She says, "Difficult cases crop up in every area of inquiry; they never give ground for general skepticism" (351). With Midgley's advice in mind, let us look at how Muir describes the behavior of Stickeen after the dog gazes into the crevasse: [Stickeen] began to cry, and after taking another piercing look at the tremendous gulf, ran away in desperate excitement, seeking some other crossing. By the time he got back, baffled of course, I had made a step or two. I dared not look back, but he made himself heard; and when he saw that I was certainly bent on crossing he cried aloud in despair. The danger was enough to daunt anybody, but it seems won- derful that he should have been able to weigh and appreciate it so justly. No mountaineer could have seen it more quickly or judged it more wisely, discriminating between real and apparent peril.</page><page sequence="14">152 Western American Literature When I gained the other side, he screamed louder than ever, and after running back and forth in vain search for a way of escape, he would return to the brink of the crevasse above the bridge, moaning and wailing as if in the bitterness of death. ( S 58-59) There seems to me nothing sentimental in this passage. The actions described, and the motives ascribed, are closely and carefully linked. There is nothing Stickeen does that is outside the realm of canine behavior, and there are no motives posited which are not plausible as causes of that behavior. At the very end of the passage Muir is especially meticulous; he says that Stickeen wailed "as if' in the bitterness of death. Muir offers the speculation as a hypothe- sis, not as a settled fact. He leaves the reader to decide whether or not it is a reasonable hypothesis. It seems to me that Muir is quite a judicious ethologist. To describe Stickeen as "in despair" is to use the phrase appropriately. To suggest that Stickeen was able to accurately "weigh and appre- ciate" the danger in a manner similar to a human mountaineer seems quite justified; the dog had been unfazed by previous crevasses, but when he perceived this new, much larger one, his behavior changed drastically. If this requires us to posit some sort of power of con- ceptualization in the dog, so be it. Granting the animal a certain level of ability in this regard is neither foolish nor sentimental; it is the most reasonable conclusion. At the end of the passage, when Muir feels compelled to char- acterize the dog's behavior in a way that he senses might be more of a surmise on his part, he uses, as pointed out above, the "as if' construction. He wants to convey to the reader that he believes Stickeen has some concept of death, but he also understands the more debatable aspects of this belief. How deep is this concept, how similar is it to a human conception? Muir doesn't feel that he knows with a high degree of certainty and his text honestly reflects this tentativeness. In one of those comparisons between humans and animals of which philosophers are so fond, Alfred North Whitehead says: "A dog anticipates the conformation of the immediate future to his pre-</page><page sequence="15">David Copland Morris 153 sent activity with the same certainty as a human being. When it comes to calculations and remote inferences, the dog fails" (42). What interests Muir is the type of inference that Stickeen is capable of making. In the course of his experience with the dog, Muir learns that the scope of this inference is larger than he would have thought. The depth of Stickeen's conception of death is unknown, but it is sufficient to create a fully understandable bond of feeling across species. In the process of describing Stickeen's actions and motivations, Muir uses the "as if' construction at least six times in the last sec- tion of the narrative, always sensitive to whether or not he is justi- fied in drawing his conclusions. Here is another example, one which delves specifically into the nature of Stickeen's conscious- ness: When I had decided to dare the bridge, and while I was on my knees chipping a hollow on the rounded brow above it, he came behind me, pushed his head past my shoulder, looked down and across, scanned the sliver and its approaches with his mysterious eyes, then looked me in the face with a startled air of surprise and concern, and began to mutter and whine; saying as plainly as if [italics mine] speaking with words, "Surely, you are not going into that awful place." This was the first time I had seen him gaze deliberately into a crevasse, or into my face with an eager, speaking, troubled look. That he should have rec- ognized and appreciated the danger at the first glance showed won- derful sagacity. Never before had the daring midget seemed to know that ice was slippery or that there was any such thing as danger any- where. (S 55-57) Muir is not saying here that Stickeen is capable of language, but he does say that the animal made gestures which conveyed a perfectly understandable, yet surprisingly knowing assessment of the situa- tion. Muir is careful to indicate that Stickeen's gestures on the occa- sion of encountering the great crevasse are quite different than those that had appeared before. He is creating a context for inter- pretation as Midgley would urge, rather than relying on sentimental projection (on the one hand) or rigid reliance on the idea of instinct (on the other). Surely, as Muir describes the situation, it would be</page><page sequence="16">154 Western American Literature wholly inadequate to ascribe Stickeen's behavior to "instinct." In an angry moment from another of his texts, Muir harshly criticizes the concept of instinct in a way that has much relevance to Stickeen: "How thick a mass of sound, serviceable ignorance is comfortably covered up in the stupid word instinct! Simply by pronouncing this one fetish word, all the wisdom, all the mental powers of animals, lose their natural significance, are at once emptied" ( John of the Mountains 278). I would like to discuss one more example of the "as if' phrase in order to explore further the care with which Muir observed and explained behavior. When Stickeen comes to a dead halt on the ice bridge at the foot of the near-vertical wall he must climb in order to reach safety, Muir thinks of looping a cord around the dog to haul him up: But while I was thinking whether an available cord might be made out of clothing, he was looking keenly into the series of notched steps and finger-holds I had made, as if [italics mine] counting them, and fixing the position of each one of them in his mind. Then suddenly up he comes with a springy rush, hooking his paws into the steps and notch- es so quickly that I could not see how it was done, and whizzed past my head, safe at last! ( S 64-65) If in one of the previously quoted passages Muir treads on seem- ingly difficult ground by putting words in the dog's mouth (as it were), here he seems to suggest Stickeen capable of "calculation." Now, of course, in the passage from Whitehead quoted earlier, the philosopher specifically ruled out calculation as a quality of animal mentality. However, Muir makes a plausible case, not for a kind of circus-like counting, to be sure, but for a kind of calculative power that reveals an independent agency in the animal. It is the power to act in novel ways when the situation calls for it. Stickeen had never crossed an ice bridge of this type before, but he "calculated" what to do in a way not all that much different from the way in which Muir himself thought things through. At least this is what Stickeen's gestures and behavior would plausibly signify.</page><page sequence="17">David Copland Morris 155 If in writing Stickeen Muir complicates the notions of speech and calculation with regard to animals, he utterly transforms the Cartesian clock metaphor I discussed earlier. When describing how Stickeen appeared when Muir looks back across the crevasse at him, Muir uses, ironically, the clock metaphor for animal exis- tence - but look how differently it signifies in his hands: [Stickeen's] natural composure and courage had vanished utterly in a tumultuous storm of fear. Had the danger been less, his distress would have seemed ridiculous. But in this dismal merciless abyss lay the shadow of death, and his heart-rending cries might well have called Heaven to his help. Perhaps they did. So hidden before, he was now transparent, and one could see the workings of his heart and mind like the movements of a clock out of its case. His voice and gestures, hopes and fears, were so perfectly human that none could mistake them. (5 60-61) Rather than being a tool for denying kinship with animals, the clock metaphor becomes a way in which to assert that kinship. To a sig- nificant extent, Muir suggests, animals are mechanisms only to the degree that we humans are too. The fact that their gestures can sometimes be interpreted along lines similar to our own indicates our consciousnesses have similarities, and are not inexplicably and essentially different. And to the degree we are similar, the notion of moral regard owed to animals becomes complicated. Muir seems to have been a man unusually open to experience of any kind and long accustomed to rejecting rigid orthodoxy; perhaps this was due to his early hard-won independence from an almost maniacally uncompromising and unjust father. Whatever the reason, at thè end of Stickeen he says: "Our storm-battle for life brought him to light, and through him as through a window I have ever since been looking with deeper sympathy into all my fellow mortals" (5 73). Philosopher Neil Evernden gives us a context for appreciating just what Muir accomplished a century ago with his narrative: One of the simplest ways of defending the notion of absolute distinc- tions between human and non-human life is to encourage total igno-</page><page sequence="18">156 Western American Literature rance of animals - a practice religiously followed by many humanists. Science also helps such ignorance, paradoxically, because it gives us a mechanistic image instead of experience of the animal. So long as we have limited direct experience of the creatures in question, it is relatively easy to accept a cultural stereotype in its place, in this case animal-as-object. But when there is personal experience, a much more difficult substitution must take place. (77-78) We should be grateful that John Muir was capable of overcoming an astonishing variety of difficulties, including this one. For a cultural stereotype, Muir substituted Stickeen. In making this substitution, Muir is not being sentimental. This is an important point, I believe, for I suspect that part of the reason "nature writing" is largely left out of the dominant American liter- ature anthologies is a notion on the part of their editors that such writing is inherently sentimental. This notion may be part of the residual speciesist element in the editors' otherwise admirably pro- gressive world-views. Speciesism, which Muir is clearly combating in Stickeen, has never correlated very closely with either left- or right-wing politics. I'll close with another salient corrective from Mary Midgley: Interspecies sympathy certainly encounters some barriers. So does sympathy between human beings. But the difficulties arising here cannot possibly mean that any attempt to reach out beyond the famil- iar lit circle of our own lives is doomed, delusive, or sentimental. (351) In all his best writing, Muir is unsentimental yet engaged, non- reductive yet precise. His narrative Stickeen is a model of language that can fruitfully move beyond the binary oppositions (or what Alfred North Whitehead called the "vicious dualisms") which have led to so much inaccurate or destructive thinking about the rela- tionship between the human and non-human worlds. In seeing beyond the ideologies he inherited concerning the nature of animal minds, Muir carefully and thoughtfully broke new cultural ground. Exclusion of Stickeen from the leading anthologies of American lit-</page><page sequence="19">David Copland Morris 157 erature is a grievous mistake, for this intriguing and challenging narrative deserves the widest possible audience.
