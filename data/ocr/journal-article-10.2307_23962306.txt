<plain_text><page sequence="1">The The Ghost Dance: The Origins of Religion. By Weston La Barre. Pp. xvi+677. London: Allen and Unwin, 1972. £6-95. This monumental and entrancing work might be described as a second *Golden Bough'. The author is Professor of Anthropology at Duke University, U.S.A., and has contributed many ethnological studies, in eluding an article on Totemism, to the Encyclopaedia Britannica. He shares with Frazer a conviction that the origins of religion can be dis covered and that such a discovery provides an explanation. He also holds, along with Herbert Spencer, Carveth Read, Grant Allen et al., that religion is a superstition. But he takes an entirely new line in discarding the whole *ages and stages' framework of religious history. Therefore he does not look for the origin of religions in their elementary forms; he uncovers it as a common aberration at every level. He presents his enormous learning in terms of two basic dogmas: one, that the shaman istic ghost dance is a manifestation of the social essence of all religion; two, that for the individual religion is rooted in every man's oedipal situation in which a god is only a shaman's dream about his father. The paradigm from which the book has its title is the American Indian tribal movement of 1890, first recorded by James Moody. This was the</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 241 Plain Indians' response to the loss of hunting territories, extinction of buffalo herds, military defeats, repeated droughts, and new diseases. If the tribes performed 'The Ghost Dance' 'a new skin would slide over the whole earth, covering up the Whites and all their works, and bringing upon it new trees and plants, great buffalo herds, the ghosts of the dead, and the great departed warriors and chiefs.' For Professor La Barre this becomes one of the typical crisis cults of which there are numerous manifestations, and on these he is the undoubted authority. They have parallels in the Melanesian cargo cults, and many other salvation move ments to cope with social and cultural stress. All of them are moved by a shaman or priest, the shaman being a human practitioner possessed by an alien spirit or power. Shamanism is assumed to be the universal spring of religious behaviour, and this book is an exhaustive and fully documented survey with philosophic reflections upon it. To this reflection La Barre brings a modified Freudian identification of the shaman with the father figure, interpreted as the most acute form of the relationship between parents and children. This logic, interweaving charisma, trances, revela tions with the psychic compensation of the child painfully realizing its steady loss of omnipotence, runs through the whole work. Religion is therefore an entirely human phenomenon, and 'the humanism' is entirely self bounded. In this La Barre's strongest intellectual kinship is with Feuerbach. The early chapters describe the kinds of stress human life is heir to: the shock of birth, the loosening of maternal protection, the struggle with paternal power, on the domestic plane; then the community shocks are listed, deriving from rapid social change, mixtures of peoples and cul tures, conquests, deprivations causing resentments, and the rise of rival minority cults. There are arguments, however, to show that all stress and anxiety does not send the human psyche to superhuman powers for compensating energy and confidence. But the author's description of the specialized conditions in which it does not do so, the present reviewer finds obscure. It seems to come to an admission that even in religious cultures very large parts of life are handled with what he calls, after Freud, 'The Reality Principle', and this seems more like common sense and observation than Freud's 'Pleasure Principle'. In the second half of his voluminous work Professor La Barre educes, as if developing a photographic film, the shamanistic essence of the Western faiths, namely those of Greece, Rome, and Israel. His critique of Christian origins is embedded in these accounts. The vicissitudes of Greek religion are first related to the ethno-political meeting of the Indo European cults with those of the native Aegean occupants. This mixture gives rise to one kind of cultural tension. He will have nothing to do with 1017 c 73</page><page sequence="3">242 REVIEWS the 'development of religion' school which holds that the humanization of the deathless Homeric gods led to their displacement by the resurgent more chthonic religious forces of the Hellenistic age. On the contrary, the Olympians were originally human beings with a plentiful dose of magic power over nature as animal shamans, over earth spirits and fertility, or bird shamans over the sky and the weather. Certainly, the difference between gods and men is immutable in Homer, but the manipulation of human behaviour by outside divinities is a transcendentalizing of the difference between the purveyors of spiritual powers and their clients. The gods are anthropomorphic because they began as men. They were displaced by two influences, a political one when the submerged Aegeans revolted against the conquering Achaeans, and an intellectual religious change with a complex of forces made up of scepticism in the tragic dramatists, the formation of literature, urbane speculation, recrudescence of Orphism, the spread of naturalistic philosophy, the Sophists' transfer of curiosity from the mystery of the gods to the mystery of man himself, and the discovery that mores are man-made, not divinely ordained natural determinants. After the two chapters on The Deathless Gods and The Death of the Gods, Professor La Barre makes his boldest stroke in the one entitled The Greek Ghost Ghost Dance. It is an interpretation of Platonism not as the summit of Greek philosophy, but as its final catastrophe, a supreme manifestation of the Hellenistic failure of nerve. 'When Socrates passed onward the old Pythagorean-Heraclatean theory of the immortal soul he wakened no one from his dogmatic slumbers. When Plato added Orphic-Dionysian theo logy to this, he enabled men to keep on dreaming a Stone-Age dream.' Platonism is shamanism made metaphysical and it evades the central human problem by separating the lower world of the senses from the heavenly world of the idea. 'The hubris of rationalism destroyed both Greek religion and Greek science; the hubris of Platonism destroyed Greek democracy, and with it any better hope for man.' La Barre's superbly eloquent scorn for Plato's thought is matched by his moral indignation at Plato's anti-democratic politics. In this section on the Greeks there is some hit-and-miss in his use of such scholars as Jane Harrison, Gilbert Murray, and above all E. R. Dodds from whom he derives the key idea that the Greeks lost their religious prime because they had no psychology of the irrational. But he uses these secondary sources to build up an architectural argument of great vigour and artistry. The Jewish experience is handled in the last chapter under the heading The The Immortal People. The ancient Moses was, of course, an archaic tribal sheik-shaman, and the later priestly attempts to establish Mosaic mono</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 243 theism came out of the struggle to establish the centralized secular state in Jerusalem, a religious and political innovation. It was in the destruction of the Temple and of all Jerusalem that the Israelites suffered the most severe cultural trauma of all. So the Babylonian captivity is seen as the greatest ghost-dance crisis in their history. Thereafter the Priestly Code falsified the ethnic and religious past of the Hebrews, developed an obsessive Sabbatarianism and other sacerdotal expressions of a religious super-ego. This trend, in Zealots and Pharisees, was, however, counter balanced by Sadducees and Essenes, and it was from these two buds that Christianity and eventually Protestantism burgeoned. Professor La Barre's panegyric of the Jewish people fastens upon their fidelity to a literary tradition, their tenacious adherence to the Law, and reverence for its teachers. These qualities, which continually threaten priestly formalisms, constitute the essential religiousness of the Jew. 'Where the Greeks sought to know physis, the Hebrews imbibed the Law, the nomos of the Unknowable One.1 By disengaging them from localities, states, and cultures, their history since the Diaspora has forearmed Jews to cope with changing cognitive climates. It has also made them 'the lightning rod of other men's miseries', and the scapegoat for calamities, the traditional adversaries of all establishments. But chiefly, in La Barre's estimate, the Jewish scientific intellect has seemed to break through tradition. 'To adopt the scientific position is to be a Jew.' Above all, the Jewish race has given us Sigmund Freud who taught us to fathom irrationality and to distinguish the Reality Principle from the Pleasure Principle, connecting the Reality Principle with the masculine super-ego, and the Pleasure Principle with the feminine psyche, and classifying compulsion neurosis as a private religion parallel to public cults which function as collective escape-hatches from stress. Professor La Barre's salute to the beneficent influence of the Jews is summed up in this characteristic dictum: 'The Hebrews explored the mystique of Father hood—and then had to fight their way out of the intellectual tyranny of an authoritarian tribalism.' This was possible because for the Jew only the Eternal sustains him. But a cynical reading might suggest that he is giving top marks to Jewry for reducing divinities to only one, and that is getting nearest to having none at all. The author's application of his diagnostic method to Christianity is summarily given in the Epilogue. It covers the familiar ground of impugning the validity of Christian origins as presented by believing historians and theological apologists, with an awareness of recent studies of e.g. the Dead Sea Scrolls. The main calamity was St. Paul's identifica tion of the divine Hebraic Father with the divinized Hellenistic Son. Paul's paranoiac anti-sex personality lay behind the guilt-ridden salvation</page><page sequence="5">244 REVIEWS doctrine which appropriated Jesus and made Christ into a human sacri fice to avert the divine wrath, and thus successfully perverted 'the Other Jesus' of the Jerusalem Group. Paul is said to have revived the human sacrifice which Abraham had abolished, and to have produced a typical ghost-dance 'melange adultere de tout' with a 'jumble of symbolism of the archaic scapegoat, paschal lamb, the murdered son god of the Great Mother, and the Orphic dying god who was eaten to confer immortality.' This amalgam is simply Paul's personal neurosis. The author's eloquence rises with his ridicule. He shows great regard for Albert Schweitzer for throwing up the theological sponge, and he condoles with him for the subsequent masochism of the flight to Lambarene. There is an Appendix on The False Messiahs from Theudas to modern Angel Dancers and Doomsday prophets. A book on this scale and with this one's cogency deserves a salute from even a theological reviewer whose business is impugned from start to finish. With some background in social anthropology and in the history of cultures, I have found it engrossing and most informative. Moreover, it is so well written that I have with only partial success avoided describing its contents in the author's own words. Apart from its main thesis which attacks the validity of all mankind's religious experience, there are some defects to be noted. For all its magisterial sweep this book suffers from a certain one-sidedness even in its own plane. For instance, many cults are known which do not seem to be caused by emotional unrest, but are practised because of simple belief in their practical secular efficiency. Their rituals are often ceremonial games, to which Levi-Strauss has called attention in La Pensee Sauvage, where the play element quite replaces the agonistic struggle for results. People dance not only for, but with the rain. They exchange valuable gifts for social prestige only. Urban immigrants of former pastoral stock will substitute a birthday party or a commemorative dinner for the animal sacrifices their forebears performed at the family crises of birth and death. La Barre's interpretation in terms of a salvation utilitarianism is overdone, and is reminiscent of nineteenth-century historians of early religion. Then, the psychological key he uses is, in the following of Freud, far too closely tied to an obsession with patriarchal problems. He keeps on referring to 'the nuclear family' and to man as 'the oedipal animal'. The shamanism he finds everywhere is 'supernatural male power'. When he reiterates that 'father and son form the most critical and dangerous relationship on earth' one wonders how he can have skirted over the social dilution of this relationship by the wider kinship unit where the physical father and nuclear family are merged in a wider social parenthood</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS 245 and brotherhood and where children are as dependent on their age-mates as on kin. Frazer long since showed that the totem bond is stronger than the bond of blood or family in the modern sense. It is surprising that La Barre makes nothing of the immense anthropological evidence that the elementary group relationship was not that of blood but of a con tinued participation in a life wider and more long-lived than the nuclear family. One can only deduce that he has a fixation upon the oedipal type of father-son tension, and generalizes the early psychoanalytic diagnosis drawn from the middle-class urban citizenry of Europe and its offshoots. Even such a voluminous treatise as this cannot be expected to cover everything, but one which claims to elucidate 'origins of religion' as such cannot escape a certain disbalance by ignoring the far-eastern religions of Asia and by attending only to a line running from the dancing sorcerer of the palaeolithic caves to the religious phenomena of the Western world. Again, it would be not altogether gratuitous to call attention to a serious lack in the logic of this book's case. There are tribal societies with no religious beliefs or practices. Not all are taboo-minded or magic-ridden. Some have purely secular rituals and others have no rituals at all. A comparative study seems called for to test La Barre's basic hypothesis, by exploring whether tribal atheists and modern secularized peoples are less disturbed by insecurity, cultural shifts or deprivation, than the numerous devotees of some ghost-dance compensatory religion. My main dissatisfaction in a book which in many ways commands my admiration is with the unconvincing link between the religious pheno mena so vividly portrayed and the psychological kernel of the father-son tension and the alleged Reality Principle. One of the author's repeated formulae states that fathers make gods, mothers make magicians; but then also, fathers represent the Reality Principle, mothers the Pleasure Principle, to use Freud's terminology. But what the Reality Principle really comes to is not established. In some places it seems to be just rationality and common sense; in others it means the temper which takes life as it comes, without compensatory illusions. It is often equated with fidelity to 'That which Is'. There is some mystagogy here, as when La Barre writes (p. 382) 'Art and religion alike arise from unsatisfied desire.' Well and good! But there follows a wonderful question-begging and anachronistic declaration: 'In the revelation the visionary withdraws his trust and love from the Reality Principle, and offers them passionately to the Pleasure Principle.' That is really too naive even for laughter. But then Professor La Barre's epigrammatic genius often runs away with him. He is not a rationalist. He contends that rationality, as in the case of Socrates, can be as autistic and absorbed in fantasy as religious con viction. Nor does he think that modern scientific utopianism is free from</page><page sequence="7">246 REVIEWS mythopoeic delusions. I welcome his dislike for the axiom of linear evolu tion as continuity in thought and history, so dear to his predecessors in this field. He records that anomalies accumulate and create confusion for every theoretical construction which is then dropped until another arises to replace it. Just as Aristotelian cosmology gives place to Copernican, and this to Newtonian, and Newton to Einstein—all disjunctively different— so his presentation of religious phenomena gives the impression of alter nating reactions to a central datum which acts gravitationally but is not phenomenally revealed. He would disown that interpretation; but in spite of his rejecting linear development theories he speaks in the book's epilogue of 'the unbroken and unmysterious ethnographic continuity of the modern European with Stone Age man'. Theologians will find themselves thoroughly explained away as con stituting an intellectual defence force for the perennial illusions offered to cope with the helplessness of mankind. The author has no more respect for the advanced theologian accommodating his doctrine to the mentality of a secularized age than he has for the deluded charismatic medicine man. And he closes his appendix with the following declaration: 'Those who find no conflict between contemporary sacred and secular culture lack not merely any sense of what happened in history, but also any insight into the meaning, nature, and purpose of their beliefs, and the grounds on which they are held.' It is impossible not to be impressed by this book's greatest qualities, namely its author's erudition, his grasp of religious, social, and intellectual history, his use of allusions in literature, his rollicking style; above all by the confidence of a man of philosophic power who knows what he wants to convey. What he wants to convey is that our most sacred beliefs are the group neurosis of our traditional society. If any reader is carried away by this superb performance and supposes it to represent the inevitable out look of the anthropologist, he could, for an entirely different interpreta tion, be referred to recent work of three professors of social anthropology, namely Mary Douglas's Natural Symbols; Monica Wilson's Religion and the the Transformation of Society, and Evans-Pritchard's Theories of Primitive Religion;Religion; in addition, to Myths, Dreams and Mysteries by Mircea Eliade, the outstanding authority on Shamanism. Search for origins of religion is a pseudo-problem. To undertake it assumes the kind of answer Professor La Barre gives. One of his premisses is that man is the culture-bearing animal; another, that magic and religion are rooted in human biology. Unless 'rooted in' here means no more than 'conditioned by', as history is conditioned by geography, the two premisses are incompatible. Outside the human race living creatures make neither errors nor science to correct them. Only man does this kind</page><page sequence="8">REVIEWS 247 of thing, and if he has no other root but the life stream, whence come cultures, psychic stresses, and their compensations, let alone philo sophies, psychologies, oedipal guilt complexes, and anthropological science itself? There are frequent minor annoyances like the use of idiosyncratic jargon, e.g. neoteny and vatic; also too many quotations from expositors instead of from easily available texts, e.g. Aristotle's Ethics quoted from Gomperz.
