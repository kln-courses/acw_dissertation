<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FRENCH REVIEW, Vol. 75, No. 4, March 2002 Printed in U.S.A. Images of Paris: Big C Culture for the Nonspeaker of French by May Spangler and Holly U. York FACED WITH A NATIONWIDE decline in their enrollments, many French departments are looking for ways to attract students. One such way is the course on culture. Kramsch has noted that foreign language educa- tors often disregard the animated debate surrounding the teaching of culture (big C vs. little c, commonalities vs. differences, C1 vs. C2 as point of departure) when it comes time to design a course, preferring instead to conduct polls to determine student needs. According to Kramsch, a bet- ter path would be to decide what would best spark student interest.' With this goal in mind, we designed a course that capitalizes on the widespread interest in Paris. We used the students' knowledge of the most popular tourist destination in the world, often in the form of little c (food, fashion, modes of life), to move to big C with the imaginary vision of painters, architects, writers, and filmmakers. Steele and Suozzo suggest that students learn to "recognize and inter- pret linguistic and nonlinguistic signs in a cultural context" as a way of integrating big C and small c cultures.2 This is the goal we established for our course. The syllabus is composed of several units. The Renaissance unit, for example, focuses on Dubois's painting Le Massacre de la Saint- Barthelemy. The painting consists of nonlinguistic signs, which the stu- dents are invited to recognize and interpret within three different disciplines: (1) architecture, in the collage-like depiction of Paris monu- ments, (2) history, portrayed in the main characters of the film La Reine Margot, and (3) literature, as it presents a pictorial version of d'Aubigne's textual description of the events in Les Tragiques. This approach includes lectures, student presentations, and most importantly student-centered analysis of artifacts. Students thus move naturally from little c to big C culture, as they take part in large- or small-group discussions and report back to the class. "Images of Paris" was first offered in French as an upper-division 756</page><page sequence="2">IMAGES OF PARIS 757 course, and the maximum enrollment of fifteen was filled. Its success prompted the present English version, as our department periodically offers courses on cultural topics of broad general appeal to be taught in English. The pedagogical philosophy is that while cultural knowledge is an integral part of communicative competence, the converse is not neces- sarily true. Much can be learned about a cultural heritage by those with little or no competence in the language of that culture. Fifteen students also signed up for the course in English. They were drawn from a more diverse group in terms of major, and we also found a wider range of lev- els with those who had some French. We are now thinking of offering "Images of Paris" as a freshman seminar, thus encouraging first-year stu- dents to consider taking a French course. The syllabus is based on the study of several representations of Paris from the Middle Ages to the present. It focuses on architecture, from the city walls to the great projects of Franqois Mitterrand. Through literature, painting and film, it explores the "myth of Paris" as it has been expressed through a profusion of images. Among those we examine revolutionary Paris with its barricades, Impressionist Paris with its crowds and shim- mering light, and the assassination of Paris by the accident of the mod- em.3 In addition we see some of its many personifications: the urchin and the warrior woman,4 the sleeping giant,' and the siren.6 To illustrate how the course proceeds, we will give the lesson plan for the first day, followed by a sample unit on the Renaissance. The full syl- labus is provided in appendix A and the bibliography in appendix B. First class: Paris in the imaginary mode After a short introduction on the symbolic importance of cities in col- lective and personal history,7 and before jumping into the course and exploring the imaginary vision of different artists, students make a visit to the Paris of their own imagination. With the lights out and our eyes closed, we "board" the metro together and each student "disembarks " at the station of his/her choice. Then the following questions are asked: 1. Look carefully at your street. In what part of the city is it located? Are there stores, apartment and office buildings, restaurants? Is it day or night? What is the weather like? 2. You are hungry and thirsty. What do you do? 3. You come to a crossing and there is a famous structure in front of you. What is it? What do you do? 4. Are there many people in the street? Do you feel threatened? Lonely? 5. Someone is approaching. What is this person like? What does s/he say to you? 6. If Paris were a person, who would it be?</page><page sequence="3">758 FRENCH REVIEW 75.4 Because of the abundant perceptions and stereotypes about French cul- ture illustrated in American films, television and advertising, even those who have not visited Paris have formed some sort of image which can be drawn out through the guide questions. It is this visualization process that first serves to engage the students and awaken their curiosity. After this virtual tour, we return to the classroom, first to share our answers in small groups, then to report the results of our discussions to the class. We come back to these images during the final class to see how they have evolved over the semester. Sample unit: The Renaissance period First class: the architecture of the Renaissance. Activity 1: A clip from the film, Du donjon a' la pyramide: le Louvre (5 min- utes) provides an introduction to the period. Activity 2: Discussion of a short reading prepared before class: Alberti, Ten Books on Architecture, book 6, chapter 1, 2, 3, and 5. Note that the course presents texts by architects (Viollet-le-Duc, Le Corbusier, Ieoh Ming Pei, Carlos Ott), to explain and articulate the different periods of architecture. Although not a French architect, Alberti is most representa- tive of the Renaissance movement. Students look for the characteristics of the Renaissance architecture in selected passages read in class. Those characteristics are then written on the board, such as: Chapter 1: the beauty of the facade should be conceived independently of structural necessity (a dominant feature of medieval architecture). Chapter 2: nature, which illustrates divine perfection, is to be taken as a model. This aspect emphasizes the importance of human creativity as a reflection of the creative power of God. Chapter 3: the architect reintroduces features from Greek and Roman architectures (therefore the name of "Renaissance" of the classical period). Buildings will have anthropomorphic members such as pilasters, pedi- ments and full entablature. Chapter 5: because architecture is a mathematical science by which the cosmic order can become visible, geometrical relations determine the design of the facade, the image of divine perfection. Activity 3: a slide presentation of the buildings. Students are invited to recognize the characteristics of Renaissance archi- tecture on slides of buildings of the time (see syllabus for listing of build- ings). The students are given in their "reader" (packet of photocopies) a historical summary of each period, including a short description of its main buildings and ink drawings of the buildings to help them memo- rize their names for a quiz on slide recognition.</page><page sequence="4">IMAGES OF PARIS 759 Homework Students are given the following exercise to do for the next class to rein- force their understanding of the architecture of the Renaissance: 1. Find a drawing or a picture of the faqade of the Cour carrie of the Louvre by Pierre Lescot (1546-59) 2. Draw the facade (it does not have to be beautiful!) 3. Indicate on your facade some elements typical of the new Renaissance style: differentiated stories, Corinthian pilasters, composite pilasters, attic without dormers, windows with mullions, triangular pediments, segmented pediments, vermiculite bossage, decor more abundant toward the top. Second Class: The d'Aubigne text is read outside of class, and one student prepares an oral presentation on the painting Le Massacre de la Saint-Barthelhmy. Activity one: presentation of Dubois, Le Massacre de la Saint-Barthilemy (1575-84).8 Before the student makes his/her oral presentation, assign a few students to write a question to be asked after the presentation. Since the painting is full of fascinating details, at least half the class will be spent looking at it. Have students come up with their own comments as much as possible. In contrast to a classical painting, which would represent an event occurring in one place and at one specific moment, the painting of Dubois presents many landmarks of Paris as in a collage, while simultaneously depicting many different time periods. Here are a few questions that may be suggested to foster the discussion after the student's presentation: 1. Do you recognize any major historical figures of the time? Since the painting depicts many characters from the movie La Reine Margot as well, it would be useful to show slides of these characters and a transparency of the genealogical tree of the Valois dynasty to familiar- ize students with the Saint-Bartholomew massacre. Franqois ler built the eglise Saint-Eustache (the church at the Halles, already discussed in the class on architecture). His son Henri II, who built the Fontaine des Innocents, married the infamous Catherine de Medicis. Among their many heirs were three kings: Franqois II, who married Mary Stuart, also known as Mary Queen of Scots; Charles IX, the reigning king during the Saint-Bartholomew's events; and Henri III ("Anjou"), who becomes the king at the end of the movie. Since Henri III will also die without an heir to his throne, Henri de Navarre, who married Marguerite de Valois just before the massacre, will eventually take over as Henri IV and start the Bourbon dynasty. At the center of the painting is represented the murder of the amiral de Coligny. It was also the central event of the Saint-Bartholomew's mas- sacre, as Coligny was one of the leaders of the Protestant party. He had</page><page sequence="5">760 FRENCH REVIEW 75.4 acquired ascent over Charles IX, and wanted to draw him into a war against Spain. Catherine de Medicis had him eliminated that night by the duc de Guise, chief of the catholic league. The painting shows simultane- ously two scenes from Coligny's murder: first when he was thrown from the window, and then when he was beheaded. Henri de Guise is proba- bly the figure on the right, pointing to the body of Coligny. Charles IX was said to have taken an arquebuse de chasse (a hunting rifle), and fired on the people of Paris from a window of the Louvre (a painting of this event Charles IX tirant sur le peuple was done by Lucien Melingue in the nineteenth century). One can indeed see someone doing just that at the window of the left crenellated tower of what appears to be the Louvre. Two other figures are looking at the window of the right tower: although difficult to recognize, they could be Henri de Navarre (the future Henri IV) imprisoned in a room of the Louvre (he was a Protestant) and his new wife Marguerite de Valois, also known as la reine Margot. Below this tower, a veiled woman in black seems to be checking a pile of bodies. A painting by Debat-Ponsan (nineteenth century) also shows Catherine de Medicis dressed in black with veils, coming out of the Louvre, and looking over dead bodies. A group of men on horses stands out on the center front of the painting. Their elegant clothing indicates that they are noblemen. The one wearing the gold trousers and cape, rid- ing a white horse, is probably Henri d'Anjou, the future Henri III. 2. Do you recognize any buildings of the period? Can you differentiate their styles of architecture? The painting gives a kaleidoscopic view of Paris, as if buildings located very far apart were put together. It also shows the juxtaposition of the Gothic and Romanesque styles with the new Renaissance style. The house of Coligny stands out as being of the Renaissance style: one can see its dif- ferentiated stories with the simple window at the basement, and the more ornate windows with mullions of the other stories, its stone Ionic pilasters framing the windows, its stepped attic with dormers. The use of brick and stone is typical of this period, as can still be seen in the place des Vosges or the place Dauphine shortly built after this event by Henri IV. The crenellated towers on the left show what the old Louvre, built by Philippe Auguste and embellished by Charles V, used to look like, although of a larger scale. The style is Gothic, but behind these towers there is a large gray roof with dormers of the Renaissance style. This is the new wing of the Louvre built by Pierre Lescault on the west side of the palace during the reign of Henri II. The river on the left is the Seine, although the small version with straight banks makes it look more like the canal de Brikve. But it is nevertheless the Seine, in which so many bodies were thrown that one could see coagulated blood covering it, as the description of d'Aubignd will tell. On the left, an old church has the</page><page sequence="6">IMAGES OF PARIS 761 heaviness and rounded arches of the Romanesque period, much as can still be seen today at the eglise of Saint-Julien-le-pauvre across the Seine from Notre-Dame. A piece of the wall of Charles V with its tower can be seen on the top right corner of the painting. On the hill above stands a gallows, which was built in the thirteenth century in Montfaucon, and at the time very much in use and part of the Parisian landscape. 3. How is the horror of the massacre conveyed? Do you think that the painter was Protestant or Catholic? The painter was obviously Protestant, and the students will notice the realism of the details: the Protestants pulled out of their sleep have no weapons to defend themselves, but they are not cowards as they pray and remain truthful to their faith to the end. The bodies are gray, as their blood has left them, and often naked. This mixture of death and eroticism gives a sense of the excitement of the people perpetrating the massacre, and indeed the carnage could not be stopped and lasted three days. One can also tell that people did not always have religion on their mind when killing, as is shown by the men stealing furniture and objects from their victims. Many Catholics were also killed for their wealth, or just for revenge. Many of the victims are women, some old, some pregnant, as can be seen on the right. There are children and old men, all outnum- bered and surrounded by piercing weapons. The most disturbing scene may be that of the two young boys pulling a small child toward the Seine: the fever to kill reaches the innocent, transforming children into murderers. To finish on a brighter note, there is a man hiding on the roof of the house next to Coligny's: a few Protestants did escape, as probably did the painter of this picture. Activity 2: Text of d'Aubignd's Les Tragiques. This text gives a vivid description of the Saint Bartholomew's massacre which seems to come straight from the painting. Here are some questions: Lines 841-50: How are the Protestants portrayed? Do you recognize some of the protagonists of the painting? (Without weapons, defenseless yet courageous victims, they even seem to consider themselves as mar- tyrs, as they offer their throat to their enemies. One can recognize the children murderers of other children). Lines 851-64: Which aspects of the description of the city strike you? (Paris is only a background for the event. No specific descriptions of the building are given. Paris will not become a central theme before the nine- teenth century. The word "bed" is repeated 4 times in those few lines, insisting on the violence of the act performed on people at their most vulnerable). Lines 864-86: How is the Seine portrayed? (Unlike the monuments, it is mentioned by name and personified as trying to drown the victims which are not quite dead. The blood is so thick on its surface that it is coagulated).</page><page sequence="7">762 FRENCH REVIEW 75.4 Classes three through five: Preparation, viewing, and discussion of the film La Reine Margot (1994, Dir. Claude Berry). Students are given the following questions before seeing the film: 1. Images of Paris What Parisian monuments are mentioned in the movie? Which ones did you recognize? How is the city represented, and what ambiance does it give to the movie? 2. Marriage, sex and love in the sixteenth century What deal does Henri de Navarre (future Henri IV) offer to Margot the night of their wedding? What was the role of marriage in the sixteenth century? Why does Margot sleep with strangers? How do you explain that she falls in love with La M 1e? 3. Representation of the body What strikes you in the movie about the representation of the body? Think of the body in Rabelais (same period), and the importance of the bodily fluids (urine for Gargantua, but also milk and blood), as well as the costumes (Margot's dresses in particular), hair, etc. After viewing the film, students are divided into three groups, each assigned one of the above topics to discuss and report back to the class. The unit on the Renaissance provides an illustration of how the awaken- ing of intellectual curiosity, with the recognition of signs and the introduc- tion of literature in a cultural context, can be accessed through this course. Because the Saint-Bartholomew massacre is such an emotionally charged moment of Parisian history, many students find themselves powerfully drawn into it. They will automatically integrate the little c and big C cultures, as they are invited to recognize and appreciate the depiction of the same event in different disciplines. Dubois's Le Massacre de la Saint- Barthelemy is an effective teaching tool as it ties together painting, film, architecture and literature. Starting with architecture, most students are familiar with the Louvre as a museum and will rise to the challenge of rec- ognizing it in its composite form of Medieval and Renaissance styles. The painting will also be reinforced by its textual counterpart of d'Aubignd's Les Tragiques, and its portrayal of the main characters of La Reine Margot. The film in turn reinforces the images and impressions acquired from the other genres with a contemporary immediacy readily appreciated by students. The following syllabus lists works from different disciplines, and may be adapted to fit the professor's specific areas of interest, as well as those of the target audience. Offering the course in English makes it accessible to more students from other departments. This outreach has the added advantage of bringing together students with diverse fields of expertise, which energizes class discussions and accomplishes the truly interdisci- plinary intention of the course.
