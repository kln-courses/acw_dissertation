Ernst FROM HAGIOGRAPHY TO MARTYROLOGY: CONFLICTING TESTIMONIES TO A SUFI MARTYR OF THE DELHI SULTANATE Martyrdom is the final resort of the weak against the powerful. It is an act of truth performed without regard for one's life. As Cardinal Danielou observed, "Martyrdom is ... the archetypal form of conflict with evil, the summit of Christian sanctity through conformation to Christ, and .. .the official proclamation of the Gospel to the accredited representatives of the earthly city."' The Islamic world has also had martyrs who resisted tyranny and injustice at any cost, from Muhammad's grandson Husayn to the self-sacrificing warriors who sought paradise through battle. Just as the Christian world created a formidable literature on martyrdom, so too there are traditions of Islamic martyrology. Important insights into the nature and develop- ment of this mode of sacred biography can be gained by analyzing the total literacy tradition that has grown up around a martyr, in century on century of religious reflection.

Sufi biographers initially avoided any reference to the execution of this man and presented instead Mas'ud's most admirable qualities to form a portrait consistent with the normative paradigms of moderate Sufism. Later hagiographers gradually inserted references to Mascud's martyr- dom into his biography, until eventually his trial and execution became the subject of a dramatic martyrology. The transformation of Mas'ud Bakk's biography was strongly influenced by the model of al-Husayn ibn Mansur al-Hallaj (d. 922), the early Sufi martyr of Baghdad; Hallaj, with his ecstatic utterances, had become a symbol of the intoxicated saint and martyr, in contrast to the standard Islamic hagiographic paradigm, based on adherence to legal and ethical norms. The way in which the hagiographies gradually accepted the image of the martyr reveals a tension between paradigms in the Sufi biographical tradition and, incidentally, contrasts with the historical interests of the court and legal circles; it demonstrates, in addition, the extraordinary influence of the model of Hallaj on Sufi martyrology. HAGIOGRAPHY AND MARTYROLOGY IN ISLAMIC HISTORIOGRAPHY In attempting to describe the different modes of biography in Islamic historiography, it will be helpful to adopt some of the genre categories that have been so well developed by the Bollandists and their succes- sors in the study of the biographies of Christian saints and martyrs.2 The vita or hagiography is the record of an exemplary life, held up as a model for the imitation of the faithful. The passio or martyrology, on the other hand, is the dramatic account of conflict with secular author- ities, resulting in persecution, trial, and death; this death is not a defeat, however, but a testimony to indestructible faith in God and often brings about the downfall of the martyr's persecutors. Both types of Christian biography are in some sense imitations of the life of Jesus, but with different emphases; the hagiography stresses attaining the highest degree of virtue, while the martyrology focuses on the direct opposition between good and evil. Christian martyrology is historically the predecessor of hagiography and ultimately derives from the liturgies 2 Rene Aigrain, L'Hagiographie: Ses sources, ses methodes, son histoire (Paris: Bloud &amp; Gay, 1953); Hippolyte Delehaye, The Legends of the Saints, trans.

It was only after the Christianization of the Roman Empire that hagiography began to evolve into a separate genre, as a suitable model for imitation in a Christian society. The various forms of Islamic biographical literature are also essen- tially paradigmatic, and their roots, naturally enough, are to be found in the study of the life of the Prophet Muhammad. The life of the Prophet or Sira by Ibn Ishaq (d. 768) is the earliest surviving example of this genre. Its construction includes various elements of biblical legend, Arab oral epic, and accounts of the military actions (maghazi) of the Prophet, but the most distinctive aspect of the Sira is its reliance on hadith, the oral reports of the sayings and deeds of the Prophet.3 Since the Prophet's life was exemplary, hadith took on a paradigmatic aspect from the very beginning. Other biographical writings were conceived of as ancillary to the life of Muhammad. The first bio- graphical dictionary arranged by "classes" or generations (tabaqat) was Ibn Sa'd's (d. 844-45) work on the companions of the Prophet; this compilation was oriented toward the study of these men as trans- mitters of hadith.4 The function of Islamic biographical literature is thus essentially paradigmatic; its basic unit of evidence, the hadith, was the source for the sunna or Prophetic example, which all the faithful were called on to imitate. Thus the hadith-based Prophetic biography, as well as its supplements, was designed to serve as the basis for legal and ethical norms. Works devoted to the lives of jurists and religious scholars demonstrated the continuous history of the custodians of revelation and served to ensure the transmission of religious norms. At the same time, secular dynastic history grew parallel with religious tradition, usually presenting historical events to serve as warnings for moral edification (and, incidentally, to flatter royal patrons). Secular annals differed from the oral method of hadith by employing written docu- ments to produce continuous narrative, in imitation of the Iranian and Hellenistic dynastic chroniclers. Nonetheless, even universal histories, 3 W. Montgomery Watt, "The Materials Used by Ibn Ishaq," in Historians of the Middle East, ed. Bernard Lewis and P. M. Holt, Historical Writing on the Peoples of Asia (London: Oxford University Press, 1962); this whole volume is of great value for the study of Islamic historiography.

The biographical mode continued to dominate local histories, also, so that the massive History of Baghdad by al-Khatib al-Baghdadi (d. 1071) is basically a long series of biographies of both secular and religious figures.5 From the very beginning, Sufi biographical writing was strongly focused on the Prophetic paradigm and the hadith methodology. The earliest known Arabic hagiography was the Classes of the Sufis of 'Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami (d. 1021), which contains 999 biographies arranged by generations (as in Ibn Sa'd's work mentioned above). The dependence of this work on the hadith methodology is striking. Most of the entries begin with a hadith of the Prophet transmitted by the Sufi in question, followed by a series of the Sufi's own mystical say- ings.6 Sulami's objective was not narrative biography but the illumina- tion of each saint's "words, character, and life-story, as a guide to his path [tariqa], his inner state, and his knowledge."7 This was followed by the encyclopedic Ornament of the Saints of Abu Nu'aym al-Isfahani (d. 1038), in ten volumes, which contained an important narrative ele- ment to fill out the doctrinal picture.8 At this early stage, however, narrative was clearly subordinate to the essential spiritual message. It was only with such master storytellers as the Persian Farid al-Din 'Attar (d. ca. 1220) and the Egyptian al-Yafici (d. 1367) that story began to take precedence over doctrinal paradigm, so that we find the luxurious florescence of a truly legendary corpus of hagiography.9 In 5 An excellent guide to Islamic historiographical sources is Jean Sauvaget's Introduc- tion to the History of the Muslim East: A Bibliographical Guide, based on the 2d ed. as recast by Claude Cahen (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1965), chap. 3, "Narrative Sources." 6 For Sufi reliance on the Prophetic example, see Tor Andrae, Die Person Muham- meds in Lehre und Glauben seiner Gemeinde, Archives d'Etudes Orientales, vol. 16 (Stockholm: Kungl.

Typical of the best Indian Sufi hagiographies is 'Abd al-Haqq Muhaddith Dihlawi's Tales of the Great Ones, completed in 1591. Its paradigmatic focus on the Prophetic model is made clear in the author's introduction. He says that since sainthood is a continuation of the Prophetic mission, it is, by this analogy, great beyond all estimation. Thus the best form of devotion is keeping the company of the saints, or else hearing about the deeds of the saintly, because this will bring about great spiritual concentration (himmat) and many other blessings." 'Abd al-Haqq strenuously applied the methods of hadith study to both written and oral sources and says that his work is based on "trustworthy transmitters regarding whose truthfulness there is a clear preference, but it is especially concerned with using the type of close scrutiny, accrediting, testing, and proving, required of the efforts of writers of history and auditors of hadith reports; it is written down just as it was heard.""2 One strength of a hagiography such as Tales of the Great Ones is that it is likely to mirror contemporary traditions without adding the author's own conceits and inventions, although selectivity and, occasionally, suppression of controversial material occurred in these works.'3 The inferior works suffer more or less from padding with ornate and inflated prose style and are less critical of miracle stories. The concept of martyrdom occurs very early in the Islamic tradition and gave rise to several different kinds of martyrology. Originally, the Arabic term shahid was used in the Qu'ran to mean "witness," one who sees as well as one who testifies. Among the early Muslims there were several who suffered persecution or death for their faith.'4 Many in "Piccoli appunti di agiografia araba," in A Francesco Gabrieli (Rome: Dott. Giovanni Bardi, 1964). A number of the Islamic stories have clear precedents in the religious fiction of Hellenistic Christianity. 10 The vast Persian hagiographical literature is described in C. A.

But it was above all among the Shi'is that a sense of martyrdom arose, in the wake of the undeniably severe persecutions inflicted on the imams descended from the Prophet. The beginnings of a martyrological literature on the "killing" (maqtal) of the imam can be traced to such origins.s1 Later on, however, even in Sunni Islam, the concept of martyrdom became generalized enough to make a "martyr" of anyone who died for the faith, whether in battle with the infidels or while engaged in pious and holy deeds.'6 Shi'ism even developed an elaborate lamentation poetry and popular passion plays for use in the emotionally charged Muharram celebrations, in memory of the martyrdom of Husayn. This contrasts with the Christian martyrs' liturgies, which were initially the central literary form and only later developed into paradigmatic hagiography. Islamic histo- riography reverses the relationship between passio and vita. The Islamic martyrologies are later and derive their authority from the norms established by the Prophet and the imams. For Sufis, it was above all Hallaj who served as the model of the martyr. Hallaj actively courted martyrdom at the hands of his fellow Muslims. He cried, "Kill me, my trustworthy friends, for in my killing is my life."'7 The French scholar Louis Massignon devoted over fifty years to the study of Hallaj, "the mystical martyr of Islam," as he subtitled his great monograph La Passion de Husayn ibn Mansur Hallaj.'8 In a review of the first edition of Massignon's book, Hans Heinrich Schider concluded: "He [Hallaj] is the martyr of Islam, for he took the final and unalloyed consequence of the most deeply embedded tendencies in the Islamic religion'toward personal appro- priation and confirmation of the divine manifestation, the consequence of perfect loving surrender to the unity of the divine being-not in order to win holiness in secret, for oneself alone, but to preach it, to 15 James A.

Among the many whom Hallaj influenced are a significant number of Sufis who were put to death by local authorities. In their understand- ing, and to many of their contemporaries, the example of Hallaj was never far away.20 His life established a pattern of proclamation of mystical union by the phrase ana al-haqq (I am the Truth), instruc- tion of disciples and ecstatic preaching in public, and seeking death before the law as a sacrifice to the divine beloved. Sufi martyrology was, however, a controversial subject. Hallaj's eccentric behavior and audacity caused many leading Sufis to disown or ignore him, at least in public, for some time after his death. It was felt that lesser souls might construe Hallaj's internally directed spiritu- ality as a license to escape the responsibilities of the external religious law; antinomianism and libertinism could be the unintended result of publicizing his example among the undisciplined masses. Yet it is likely that the Sufis cultivated their own form of martyrology in pri- vate, for we know of several no longer extant books on the persecu- tion of the Sufis that circulated in the twelfth century.21 The public norms characteristic of hagiography were not always compatible with the explosive possibilities suggested by martyrology. The ethical and legal ideals of hagiography were bound up with a social system whose presuppositions were questioned by martyrs; thus many moderate Sufi writers attempted to avoid the conflict between vita and passio by simply not mentioning the execution of Hallaj or by quoting his writings anonymously. Although Hallaj's spiritual state and cruel death earned him the respect of many moderate Sufis, nonetheless his position remained ambiguous. There was substantial support for the view that his execu- tion was required because he had revealed the secret of divine lord- ship. As the Persian poet Hafiz put it, "That friend by whom the gibbet's peak was ennobled-his crime was this, that he made secrets 19 H. H. Schfider, Der Islam, vol. 15 (1926), quoted by Annemarie Schimmel, Al-Halladsch, Mdrtyrer der Gottesliebe (Cologne: Jacob Hegner, 1968), p. 15; cf.

It is easy to see how tension could arise between the models of normative hagiography and enthusiastic martyrology in the case of someone like Hallaj. The natural instinct of the traditional Islamic scholar, oriented toward the hadith-based Prophetic paradigm, would be to minimize the sensational and potentially revolutionary implica- tions of martyrdom. Nevertheless, India possessed at an early date an enthusiastic mar- tyrology that was permeated with the Hallajian model. As Annemarie Schimmel has pointed out, the folklore and vernacular songs of north- west India are full of references to Mansur (Hallaj) and his fate.24 Hallaj also occupied an important place in the high literary tradition of Persian writing in India. An eloquent example of this interest in Hallaj is furnished by Qadi Hamid al-Din Nagawri (d. 1244), a close companion of the Chishti leader Qutb al-Din Bakhtiyar Awshi (near whose tomb Mas'ud Bakk would be buried). In his Treatise on Love, he has given an impressive eulogy of Hallaj and ana al-haqq: If you listen with the ear of the soul, every moment the cry of ana al-haqq is rising in all things; there is no cry in the world but this. Yet in the spiritual state of Mansur [Hallaj], when his tongue entered into speech, so much meaning was expressed, that when the saintly lord Husayn Mansur Hallaj- God's mercy on him-was torn to pieces and burned and his ashes thrown to the wind, nevertheless [his remains] voiced [?] and spread [?] this cry, and thus it became well known. But that cry was not from Mansur; "I am I, God" [inni ana allah, cf. Qur. 20:12] came forth from the bush, and the bush was not really there. What wonder, then, if it came forth from Mansur, and Mansur was not really there?25 22 Khwaja Shams al-Din Muhammad Hafiz Shirazi, Diwan (Tehran: Shirkat Offset, n.d.), p. 111, no. 142 (Qazwini ed.). 23 Abu Hamid al-Ghazali, Ihya' 'Ulum al-Din (Cairo: Dar al-Shu'ab, n.d.), pt. 1,61, quoted (with some typographical errors) in Sharaf al-Din Yahya Maneri, Maktubat-i Jawabi(Cawnpore: Newal Kishore, 1910), no. 15, pp. 21-22. 24 Schimmel, Mystical Dimensions of Islam, p. 75. 25 Qadi Hamid al-Din Nagawri, 'Ishqiya, MS 21/192 Farsiya, Habib Ganj Collection, Maulana Azad Library, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, fol. 143b; cf.

The influence of the martyrdom of Hallaj on Indian Sufism reveals itself further in the writing of Sayyid Mir Mah of Bahraich, a Sufi who flourished during the reign of Firuz Shah. His account is espe- cially interesting since Mir Mah lived near the tomb of the warrior- saint (ghazi) Salar Mas'ud in Bahraich, in an environment saturated with the symbolism of holy war and martyrdom.27 He narrates that once a Hindu army raided Bahraich, killing several Sufis in the hos- pice and wounding Mir Mah himself. In setting the stage for describ- ing this incident, Mir Mah has given a litany on the martyrdoms suffered by the prophets and saints, beginning with Adam; the suffer- ings of these holy ones began when God ("the Sultan of love") revealed Himself to them: Adam the pure, on the day when the Sultan of love showed His face, was cast out of paradise and placed in the world as a stranger.... [Noah, Jonah, Abraham, etc. are described.] ... The Prophet of God Muhammad, on the day when He [God] showed his face, migrated from Mecca to Medina; and likewise Husayn Mansur that time when they put him on the gibbet, and 'Ayn al-Qudat Hamadani that time when he was in the fire, alas, they burned him. And [so it was] that day the Sultan of love showed his face to the author of this book, in the region of Bahraich.28 The importance of the Sufi martyrs can be gauged by the fact that this list includes ten major prophets and only two Sufis, Hallaj and 'Ayn al-Qudat ('Ayn al-Qudat Hamadani, d. 1131, was another famous Sufi martyr in the Hallajian tradition).

Alongside these enthusiastic admirers of Hallaj's martyrdom there were, to be sure, some cautionary voices among Indian Sufis. This more restrained attitude in public is evident in the advice of Husam al-Din Manikpuri (d. 1418), a Chishti in Bengal who maintained that Hallaj and 'Ayn al-Qudat were not good models for novices to fol- low.30 In the same way, a Sufi attached to the court of Firuz Shah, Jalal al-Din Bukhari, said that Hallaj's execution was justified both externally as an affront to the religious law and internally as a deliberate self-sacrifice.31 Although the more ecstatic Sufis greatly and uncritically admired the example of Hallaj, others tempered their private approval of Hallaj with an ambivalence toward the concrete reenactment of the sacrifice of martyrdom. In the biographical tradi- tion surrounding Mas'ud Bakk, a Sufi martyr who admired and quoted both Hallaj and 'Ayn al-Qudat, it will not be surprising to find a tension between hagiographical and martyrological modes of representation. TIHE MAKING OF A MARTYR Mas'ud Bakk32 was one of the most striking figures in early Indian Sufism. According to most accounts, he was born in the region of Bukhara in Transoxania, where he belonged to a princely house; later he migrated to India and is said to have been a close relative of the Sultan, Firuz Shah.

Affiliation with the Chishtis would have been rather unusual for someone having connections with the court since the Chishtis were notable for their refusal to accept royal patronage and interference.34 The contemporary documentation of Mas'ud's life is very sketchy, aside from his own literary works.35 Mascud Bakk's writings were very popular among later generations of Indian Sufis, some of whom went to the extent of making talismans out of his writings, and his death anniversary was regularly observed along with those of other major saints.36 33 Bruce B.

It is hard to imagine the conditions for the execution of heretics in 800/1397, the more commonly mentioned date for Mas'ud's death. At that time there was no central authority in Delhi, only warring factions and a complete breakdown of order. It was this shambles of imperial Delhi that Timur sacked the following year.

In addition, Mas'ud is the author of two speculative treatises: Mir'at al-'Arifin, ed. Abu Rija' Muhammad 'Abd al-Qadir (Hyderabad: Matba'-i Mufid, 1310/1892), and Umm al-Saha'iffi 'Ayn al-Ma'arif, MSS 202, 1444 Tasawwuf Farsi, Andhra Pradesh Oriental Manuscripts Library and Research Institute, Hyderabad. Since this article is concerned primarily with the biographical tradition, I am not going to discuss here the internal evidence from his writings for historical purposes. In a future study I plan to analyze both these treatises (Umm al-Saha'if is to be identified with the lost Tamhidat mentioned by 'Abd al-Haqq since its organization is closely modeled on 'Ayn al-Qudat's work of the same name). The letter purportedly written by Mas'ud Bakk to another Chishti Saint, Gisu Daraz (d. 1422), was probably written by the latter since it reflects the views of Gisu Daraz exactly.

The Rawa'ih or cIshq Nama ("Fragrances" or "The Book of Love") attributed to Mas'ud Bakk (MS 276 Farsiya Tasawwuf, Maulana Azad Library, Aligarh Muslim University) is a sixteenth-century forgery; the incipit is copied verbatim from that of Mas'ud's authentic work, Mir'at al-'Arifin. 36 Khalifa Khwishagi Chishti (Ghulam Mucin al-Din 'Abd Allah), Macarij al- Wilaya, MS in personal collection of K.

Unexpectedly entering a Sufi hospice, he noticed another Sufi hastily conceal the Diwan of Mas'ud Bakk's poetry for fear that a jurist would see him reading it.37 As it turned out, these fears were groundless, for CAbd al-Quddus later became devoted to the work of Mas'ud Bakk and quoted his poetry fre- quently in his own writings.38 Still, it is an interesting indication that, nearly a century after the death of Mas'ud Bakk, his works were controversial enough for someone to fear being caught reading them. At the same time, this incident is a sign of the strong appreciation of Mas'ud's writings in Sufi circles. Royal connoisseurs of poetry appre- ciated Mas'ud's verses, too; Sultan Sikandar Lodi (r. 1489-1517) had one of Mas'ud's poems inscribed in a royal tomb in Delhi in 1494, and the same poem was imitated by his Hindu court poet Brahman.39 It was only in the Mughul period, however, that a complete bio- graphical notice of Mas'ud Bakk appeared, in 'Abd al-Haqq's Tales of the Great Ones, and even this able author remained vague about the matter of Mas'ud's death. The fact that such a popular Sufi as Mas'ud Bakk was not included in biographical works until two cen- turies after his death (and even then with considerable delicacy) is further evidence for his controversial position until that time. Here is 'Abd al-Haqq's narrative: Mas'ud Bakk was a relative of Sultan Firuz; his original name was Shir Khan. Once he wore the dress of the wealthy and the powerful, but suddenly one of the divine raptures overwhelmed him, and he entered into the service of the darvishes and the circle of their society. He became a disciple of Shaykh Rukn al-Din ibn Shaykh Shahab al-Din Imam. He was in the extremity of intoxication, one of those intoxicated with the wine of unity, who smash their glasses in the wine-house of reality. He spoke intoxicated words; no one in the Chishti order had ever revealed the secrets of reality so blatantly or acted so intoxicated as he. They say that his tears were so hot that if they fell on one's hand it would be burned. He wrote many works on the science of Sufism and unification. He had one work named Tamhidat, based on the Tamhidat of CAyn al-Qudat Hamadani; many subtle realities are 37 I'jaz al-Haqq Quddusi, Shaykh 'Ahd al-Quddus Gangohi awr un ki Ta'limat (Karachi: Academy of Educational Research, All Pakistan Educational Conference, 1961), pp. 179-80. This incident probably took place around 1475. 38 Simon Digby, "'Abd al-Quddus Gangohi (1456-1537 A.D.): The Personality and Attitudes of a Medieval Indian Sufi," Medieval India: A Miscellany 3 (1975): 52. 39 Ibid., p. 52, n. 228; Simon Digby, "The Tomb of Buhlul Lodi," Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 38, no. 3 (1975): 560-61; 'Abd al-Qadir ibn Muluk Shah Bada'uni, Muntakhah al-Tawarikh, ed.

And he has a Diwan of poems, odes and lyrics, and the remaining portion of his sayings are there. He has also written responses to most of the odes and poems of Amir Khusraw. Although in regard to some of the events of his spiritual path he was not noticed as a poet, some of his intoxicated poetical sayings have been in circulation. He has another work entitled Mir'at al-'Arifin [The mirror of the gnostics], for he says, "We became the archetype of the prophet Muhammad, since every heart is in the prophetic archetype" [i.e., the title alludes to Muhammad as the mirror in which the perfected mystics see themselves]. His grave is in the tomb of his master, near the place of Khwaja Qutb al-Din in Ladosarai [Mehrauli, south of Delhi]. He has gone to rest in the manner of an ascetic and a poor man [mujarradana wa-gharibana khufta ast].40 The account begins with a typical conversion story, but there is a strong characterization of Mas'ud in terms of his predominant qual- ity of intoxication, reinforced by the example of his burning tears; although ecstasy is frequently met with in the hagiographies, Mas'ud Bakk was quite unusual in this respect. The amount of his writings is also impressive and attests to his scholarship; he was in the first generation of Chishtis to engage in extensive literary production. 'Abd al-Haqq is not entirely eulogistic, though, since he discreetly observes that Mas'ud was not always a first-rate poet. The concluding sentence of the biography is rather tantalizing in its lack of detail, however; the precision of the rest of the account does not harmonize with such a banal generality. CAbd al-Haqq's account is clearly a vita, emphasiz- ing those qualities of Mas'ud's most suitable for imitation. Mas'ud's repentance from the court life was especially to be admired, in accord with the Chishtis' traditional repudiation of royal authority. But CAbd al-Haqq reserved special praise for Mas'ud's treatise The Mirror of the Gnostics, from which he excerpted a full chapter; he regarded this as a praiseworthy mystical work precisely because it illustrated the universal qualities of the Prophet Muhammad.41 In spite of the skillful portrayal by 'Abd al-Haqq, the traditional vita of Mas'ud Bakk would soon turn into a martyr's passio. The gap in 'Abd al-Haqq's account was filled twenty-five years later by one of his favorite disciples, Muhammad Sadiq, in a hagiographical work 40 CAbd al-Haqq (n. 11 above), pp. 168-69. An almost identical but much more prolix account is given in the slightly later Akhbar al-Asfiya' of 'Abd al-Samad ibn Afdal Muhammad ibn Yusuf Ansari, a nephew of the Mughul wazir Abu al-Fadl, writing in 1605, MS 668, Khudabakhsh Oriental Public Library, Patna, no. 57, fols. 51b-52a; cf. Storey (n. 10 above), 1:983. 41 Another famous hadith scholar, 'Ali al-Muttaqi (d. 1567), also praised Mas'ud Bakk's Mir'at al-'Arifin, in his al-Jawahir al-Thamina, MS 231 Tasawwuf Farsi, Andhra Pradesh Oriental Research Institute Library. 320</page><page sequence="14">History of Religions called Words of the Sincere (written in 1614). After quoting literally from his master's account, Sadiq went on to add the following: "In short, he was unique in his time in the sect of passion and love, and the religious scholars of the day were completely at odds with him; just as it is said, he went to his death by their juristic decision, like Husayn Mansur [al-Hallaj]." Sadiq here for the first time describes Mas'ud Bakk's death as a trial and execution. The only circumstantial detail in this report is a comparison with the fate of Hallaj, which is rendered vague by its anonymity of source. Sadiq amplified further on this in a later work devoted to the lives of poets, saints, and scholars of the generations after Timur, the Classes of Shahjahan (1636-37). After quoting again literally from the account in Tales of the Great Ones, Sadiq included the following appendix: "And they say that the religious scholars of the day hated him, as the saying goes, 'A man hates what he does not understand.' In the year 800 [1397], having approved a juristic decision for his execution, they hung him from the gibbet, just like Husayn Mansur [al-Hallaj]-may God be pleased with them both! After he died they burned him."42 This version adds two features also found in the story of the martyr- dom of Hallaj (gibbet, burning of the body), but adds further to the vagueness by using a proverb to explain the persecution of Mas'ud. For some reason 'Abd al-Haqq chose to avoid discussing the circum- stances of Mas'ud Bakk's death, but he must have been aware of these two accounts, written during his own lifetime by one of his disciples. Evidently the public had come to identify Mas'ud Bakk as an archetypal Hallajian martyr, and it was this controversial reputation that caused Indian Sufis to speak of him in a gingerly fashion. Sadiq, however, has transformed his master's paradigmatic hagiography into a martyrology by linking Mas'ud's fate with that of Hallaj. Later hagiographers paid 'Abd al-Haqq the tribute of quoting his biography of Mas'ud Bakk in full, but usually with a few atmospheric touches suggestive of martyrdom. In 1613, Muhammad Ghawthi in his Rose Garden of the Pious oddly described Mas'ud Bakk as a Turkish soldier from Iraq or Tabriz and mentioned nothing of his death. In the article devoted to Shah Bajan of Burhanpur, however, he called Mas'ud "the Mansur of the age," that is, a Hallajian martyr.43 42 Muhammad Sadiq Hamadani, Kalimat al-Sadiqin, MS 671, H.L. 202, Khuda- bakhsh Oriental Public Library, Patna, fol. 60b (cf.

Storey, 1:1171). 43 Muhammad Ghawthi, Gulzar-i Abrar, Urdu translation by Fadl Ahmad Jewari, Adhkar-i Abrar (Lahore: Islamic Book Foundation, 1395), pp. 491-92, 214. 321</page><page sequence="15">From Hagiography to Martyrology 'Abd Allah Khwishagi, in the Ascensions of Sainthood (1683), made an interesting and fortuitous slip in the entry devoted to Mas'ud's master Rukn al-Din. Although he elsewhere recorded Mas'ud's tradi- tional epithet as being maqbul Allah, "he who is acceptable to God," in this instance, by the addition of a single dot, he dubbed him maqtul Allah, "he who has been killed by God." After this inspired mistake, it is also worth noticing how Khwishagi effortlessly managed to bring the name of Hallaj into conjunction with that of Mas'ud by judicious quotation of Persian verses alluding to Hallaj's martyrdom.44 In 1712, the story of Mas'ud Bakk's execution was told once more by Muhammad Bulaq, again with the suggestive comparison to Hallaj.45 It was not until the early nineteenth century, though, that a detailed narrative of the causes and circumstances of this execution was given. Sometime after 1815, Muhammad Gul Ahmadpuri, a Chishti master who maintained a large academy in the Punjab, dictated a supple- ment to an earlier hagiography, and in this he evidently included much oral tradition. Ahmadpuri's account is as follows: It is related by the late and revered "sustainer of the poor" [Muhammad 'Aqil Chishti, d. 1814, the master of Ahmadpuri] that one day the revered Mas'ud Bakk was carrying a pair of sandals for his master. A religious scholar met him on the road and asked, "Whose shoe have you lifted up [that is to say, on your head]?" He replied, "I have lifted up the shoe of God Most High." The externalist religious scholars reached a unanimous decision; beneath the Firuzabad fort on the riverbank, they martyred that revered man. Having torn his blessed limbs to pieces, they cast him into the river. After the occur- rence of this event, although the believers cast nets into the river's water, they found no trace of him. After much doubt, they found him, all limbs united and re-formed into a body, in the private room of the revered Nizam al-Din Awliya' [d. 1325] in Kilokri [an old suburb of Delhi near the Jumna]. Rais- ing him up from that place, they buried him in the tomb of his masters, near the station of Qutb al-Islam Bakhtiyar Awshi in Ladosarai. When this news reached the revered master [Mas'ud's master Rukn al-Din], he asked the judge for what reason they had martyred him. The judge said, "He affirmed that God Most High has a foot." The revered master said, "Attribution [to God] for the lowest of things is the secret of correct relation- ship[?]. Had you asked him whether the shoe of God Most High was for the personal use of God Most High?" He [Rukn al-Din] continued, saying, "'To God belong all things in heaven and on earth' [Qur. 2.284], so the shoe undoubtedly belongs to God Most 44 Khwishagi (n. 36 above), p. 604. 45 Muhammad Bulaq, Rawdat al-Aqtab, cited by K.

He said that the judge was unable to reply, so then the revered master was stirred and said, "You black-face!" At once the face of the judge became black, and he was ruined.46 In modern times, at any rate, this has become the standard version of the story of Mas'ud Bakk.47 It is remarkable that it took four centuries for a fully detailed account of Mas'ud Bakk's trial and execution to emerge, yet there are reasons to give credence to these late written versions. Mas'ud's excessive veneration for his master's sandals could easily have trig- gered political repercussions, as can be seen from an incident that occurred several decades previously, involving Shaykh Fakhr al-Din Zarradi (d. 1347) and Sultan Muhammad ibn Tughluq (d. 1351). When the Sultan summoned the leading Sufis of Delhi to demand their support in preaching a holy war against the infidels of the south, the Chishti masters were uncooperative. He tried to intimidate one of Fakhr al-Din's disciples, who was holding his master's shoes under his arms as a servant would (the disciple had just stepped forward to intercept the Sultan's gifts to Fakhr al-Din since he knew that Fakhr al-Din would refuse the gifts and thus arouse the wrath of the capri- cious king). When the Sultan questioned the disciple's rigiht to do this, the disciple stoutly replied, "To honour him I put his shoes on my head, so what is it to you that I keep them under my arm, and myself hold his robe and silver?" The Sultan, enraged, shouted, "Leave off these beliefs of infidelity [i'tiqad-ha-yi kufr-amiz] or I will kill you!" The disciple replied that he would welcome such martyrdom for his master's sake, and the Sultan, finding that his intimidation had failed, desisted.48 Now obviously it was not just the veneration of 46 Muhammad Gul Ahmadpuri, Takmila-i Siyar al-Awliya', MS in personal col- lection of K. A. Nizami, Aligarh, fol. 18b. The sentence marked with a question mark I have read as follows: kih idafat bara-yi adna sirr-i nisbat-i durust ast. In the immediately following sentence I read shuma pursida budid for shuma pursida bud. For Ahmadpuri, see Storey (n. 10 above), 1:1037. Ten years earlier in Hyderabad, Ghulam 'Ali Shah Musawi presented this story in nearly identical words, in a massive hagiography of Deccan Sufis entitled Mishkat-i Nubuwwat, MS 194 Tadhkira Farsi, Andhra Pradesh Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Hyderabad, fol. 369b. Ahmadpuri's work is more complete, though, and is presumably based on some as yet undiscovered hagiography known to Muhammad 'Aqil. 47 A.

The real issue for the Sultan was his power and authority, and persecution and religiously based charges were invoked whenever they assisted his program.49 Prostration on the ground, though contrary to generally accepted Islamic legal decisions, was customary in the court of Firuz Shah, where the wazir would touch his head on the ground three times before greeting the Sultan. Up to the time of Nasir al-Din Mahmud Chiragh-i Dihli (d. 1356), the Chishti Sufis had practiced full prostration before the master, but thereafter only kissing of the feet since prostration (as in the ritual prayer) is only lawful before God.50 It is scarcely possible to overestimate the importance of such symbolic actions as prostration and reverence for shoes in medieval India. If a Sufi, such as Fakhr al-Din's disciple or Mas'ud Bakk, placed his master's sandals on his head, this in effect meant that the authority of the king, or of any other mortal, was of no consequence whatsoever. This was of course a terrible affront to the Sultan. If Mascud also uttered the ecstatic conclusion that his master was to him as God, that would only have furnished the king with an excuse to raise an appropriate theological accusation. It is understandable that the Sultan might have reacted violently against an independent and unorthodox Sufi, particularly one who (like Mas'ud Bakk?) was a member of the royal family and hence doubly a rival for authority. In other words, although there is no way to confirm the very late account of Ahmadpuri, and although it may have been influenced by other stories, it is psychologically an absolutely accurate portrayal of Farsi-i Iran wa-Pakistan; Lahore: Mu'assasa-i Intisharat-i Islami, 1398/1975), pp. 281- 83; an abridged version is given by 'Abd al-Haqq, pp. 91-92. Mir Khurd states that he heard this directly from the disciple, Qutb al-Din Dabir. 49 Muzaffar Shams Balkhi, a professor in one of Firuz Shah's colleges, commented on the Sultan's tendency to use the law to support his own whims, in his Maktubat, no. 163, trans.

The judge's remark about God having a foot is also a typical literal minded misunderstanding. When Mas'ud said that he bore the sandals of God, he meant to glorify his master as one who had attained union with God, not to raise bizarre theological heresies of an anthropomorphic nature. Yet it is entirely believable that an unimaginative judge, thinking in terms of the old handbooks of heresy, could have supposed Mas'ud to have asserted that God has a foot (this would constitute the classical heresy of tashbih or assimi- lating God to a created being).51 In addition, the description of Mas'ud's body being torn to pieces by a mob seems quite plausible when compared with an incident that Firuz Shah recorded in his tri- umphal inscription in the Firuzabad mosque of old Delhi. A man claiming to be the awaited messiah or mahdi was declared an infidel by the jurists and torn limb from limb by a mob.52 Therefore one cannot rule out the possibility that, a few years later, Mas'ud Bakk was killed in a similar manner. Mas'ud Bakk's biographical journey toward martyrology is not an isolated case in Indian Sufi hagiography; an even more remarkable example of martyrdom's attractive imagery can be seen in the case of two men best described as eccentrics, Ahmad Bihari and his associate 'Izz of Kako, two would-be Sufis of Bihar. The most eminent Sufis of the day, such as Gisu Daraz and the successors of Sharaf al-Din Maneri, regarded these men as insane or pathologically deluded.53 They had publicly insulted the Prophet Muhammad, and the Sultan swiftly put them to death.54 Yet because these two had been put to 51 An account of Firuz Shah's inquisition includes lengthy descriptions of stan- dard heresies from the classical theological handbook, the Tamhidat of Abu Shakur al-Salimi (d. ca. 1077); cf. the anonymous Sirat-i Firuz Shahi, MS 167, Sarkar Collec- tion, National Library, Calcutta, pp. 129-47 (this is a copy of MS 540, Khudabakhsh Oriental Public Library, Patna, fols. 63a-72b). 52 Firuz Shah Tughluq, Futuhat-i Firuz Shahi, ed.

But the men were already in chains before the trial, so the phrase hi-qayd-u-zanjir sivasat farmudim must be interpreted in its historical sense: under Muhammad ibn Tughluq, siYasat, "punish- ment," had become a euphemism for execution; see Mahdi Husayn (n. 50 above), pp. 348-55; Nizami, Salatin (n. 45 above), p. 425. 325</page><page sequence="19">From Hagiography to Martyrology death for bizarre religious opinions, uncritical biographers classified them as martyrs. An astonishing scenario unfolded in several Indian hagiographies, in which Sharaf al-Din Maneri cursed the city of Delhi because of Firuz Shah's impious persecution of these "saints," and the devastating invasion of Timur in 1398 was the divine punishment for the execution of these martyrs.55 This story perfectly fulfills the requirements of the passio, with a trial, execution, and wreaking of divine vengeance on the tyrant. It also shows how certain characteris- tics came to be associated with martyrdom, such as giving expression to outrageous views in public. If, however, contemporary Sufis (and the Sultan!) were right in seeing these men as deranged pretenders, then in this instance the growth of a martyrology has been made possible by imagination alone through a story that flies in the face of known facts. Significantly, Gisu Daraz observed that Ahmad Bihari used to say things like the ecstatic sayings of Hallaj and 'Ayn al-Qudat, but the imitation seems to have been only superficial. In this instance, the same process of growth in martyrological legend has taken place, which makes it like the story of Mas'ud Bakk, but with a far less solid foundation. Ahmadpuri's story of Mas'ud Bakk's death represents the triumph of martyrology over the standard hagiography of 'Abd al-Haqq's account. The miraculous restoration of Mas'ud's body is an eloquent testimony to his saintliness, especially since it was discovered in the room of Nizam al-Din Awliya', one of the most revered figures among the early Chishti masters. The miracle also serves as a reproof to the royal power that unjustly had him put to death with judicial approval. Just as in life Mas'ud had left royalty behind and sought the society of the saints, so in death his remains were cast from the Sultan's citadel and discovered in a sacred place. It is perhaps not accidental that Mas'ud Bakk is not mentioned by any of the royal chroniclers of the Tughluq era or by any of the jurists who wrote numerous legal works under Firuz Shah's commission. Mas'ud had renounced the authority to which they were bound and thus removed himself from their purview. Even the later literary historians who mentioned Mas'ud's poetry avoided referring to his death.56 The emergence of 55 Shu'ayb Firdawsi, Manaqib al-Asfiya' (Calcutta: Nur al-Afaq, 1313/1895), pp. 129-30; 'Abd al-Rahman Chishti, Mir'at al-Asrar (n. 28 above), fol. 464a.

Martyrology may have succeeded at this time because of its ability to appease the uncertainties of the post-Mughul period and to demonstrate the infal- lible power of the spirit over all opposition. Yet regardless of the reason for its success at this time, the portrayal of Mas'ud Bakk as a martyr still retains its appeal. Rather than solving a problem of his- tory, it raises new questions, as do all martyrologies, about the authority of a secular power over independent spirituality, and it affirms the eternal worth of the martyr's sacrifice.
