THE TEMPLO DE QUETZALCOATL PROJECT AT TEOTIHUACAN A Preliminary Report Rubén Cabrera Castro,3 Saburo Sugiyama,b and George L. Cowgillb instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, Córdoba 45, México, D.F. bDepartment of Anthropology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-2402, USA Abstract The Feathered Serpent Pyramid (Temple of Quetzalcoatl) was built in a single episode involving the sacrifice of around 200 individuals, in Miccaotli or Early Tlamimilolpa times. Most were males with military gear. Many had shell collars with pendants of imitation human jaws made of worked shell teeth set in stucco; rarely were real jaws used. At the center, 20 individuals (probably all males) were buried with very rich offerings including greenstone beads, earspools, nose pendants, figurines, and strange conical objects; obsidian blades and figurines; shells; and remains of wood and probable textiles. We also explored a looters' tunnel that had severely disturbed two large pits under the pyramid; in one of these an individual of exceptional importance may have been buried. Preliminary analysis of material from tests in the platform that later obscured the front of the pyramid suggests that it may have been built as much as two centuries after the pyramid. It covered another large pit associated with the pyramid, also looted. After more than a century of archaeological work, a very large proportion of Teotihuacan remains unexcavated. Excavation alone rarely leads directly to answers to important questions, but it is necessary in many cases, and the amount that remains unexcavated is one reason why many aspects of Teotihuacan so ciety remain poorly understood. Among other things, relatively little work has been done at some of the most important build ings in the city since early in this century. One example is the great pyramid traditionally known as the Temple of Quetzal coatl. Following the authors in Berrin (1988), we will refer to the structure as the Feathered Serpent Pyramid, because this term begs fewer questions about continuities between Teotihu acan and sixteenth-century Mesoamerica. This pyramid, which measures about 65 by 65 m at the base and was originally some 20 m high, is the third largest in the city. It is near the center of the Ciudadela; a great rectangular enclosure 400 m on a side, widely regarded as the central political and symbolic focus of the city (e.g., Cowgill 1983; R. Millón 1981, 1988a). The pyr amid is flanked by two apartment complexes within the Ciudadela, the North and South Palaces, which were probably occupied by heads of the Teotihuacan state. From 1918 to 1922, Ignacio Marquina, under the direction of Manuel Gamio, conducted the first extensive scientific exca vations in the Ciudadela, uncovering and restoring large parts of its great surrounding platforms, many of the pyramids atop these platforms, and limited parts of the palaces; and investi gating parts of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid (Gamio 1922). Their work made the Ciudadela, for its time, one of the most extensively excavated and studied structures at Teotihuacan. Before 1918, the facades of the north, east, and south sides of the pyramid had collapsed, and nothing was visible but a shapeless, grassy mound. Gamio and Marquina discovered the famed western (front) facade, on which great three-dimensional serpent heads alternate with a more puzzling figure (López, Ló pez, and Sugiyama 1991; Sugiyama 1989b, 1991). This facade had been preserved by a large tiered platform (the Plataforma Adosada) built up against the west face, mostly, but not en tirely, obscuring the earlier pyramid. Gamio and Marquina found remains of some burials and offerings including shell and greenstone atop the pyramid. They dug test soundings to a depth of 9 m, but did not resolve questions about the interior of the pyramid or the possible existence of earlier structures within it. After the 1920s, archaeologists turned their attention to other parts of Teotihuacan, and for a long time almost noth ing further was done in the Ciudadela except for a few small scale excavations, although these made some very significant finds of burials and offerings (Dosal 1925; Pérez 1939). Meanwhile, great advances were made in the study of struc tures elsewhere at Teotihuacan, including tunnels into the Sun Pyramid by Gamio and later by Noguera, Vaillant, and others (Millón, Drewitt, and Bennyhoff 1965), and excavations in res idences spanning a wide range from the palatial to the very modest (e.g., Armillas 1944, 1945; Linné 1934, 1942; Séjourné 1959, 1966a, 1966b, 1966c). In the 1960s extensive clearing and restoration of structures by the Instituto Nacional de Antropo logía e Historia (INAH) (Bernal 1963; Acosta 1964; Matos 1980), intensive survey and test excavations within the city di 77</page><page sequence="2">78 Cabrera C., Sugiyama, and Cowgill rected by R. Millón (1973, 1981; Cowgill, Altschul, and Sload 1984; Millon, Drewitt, and Cowgill 1973), and the settlement survey of the Basin of Mexico directed by Sanders (Sanders 1981; Sanders, Parsons, and Santley 1979) provided a broad historical and descriptive context for Teotihuacan. The joint re sult of all these projects was a transformation in our under standing of the city. However, none of these projects carried out large-scale excavations at the Ciudadela, although Millon carried out some important test excavations, in addition to mapping and surface collecting, and one of his students con ducted an intensive reexamination and analysis of all visible ar chitectural evidence (Drucker 1974). By the late 1970s a number of points about Teotihuacan seemed clear. During the Patlachique ceramic phase (tentatively dated to about the last century b.c.) Teotihuacan grew very rap idly, and by the Tzacualli phase (roughly the first century and a half a.d.) it had become a metropolis that dominated the en tire Basin of Mexico. By the end of that phase the immense Sun Pyramid had largely been completed and numerous other tem ple complexes existed, many of them along a great, broad cer emonial way, the so-called Avenue of the Dead (R. Millon 1981). Various lines of evidence, including the scale of monu mental building and the drastic rearrangement of Basin of Mex ico population attested by Sanders, Parsons, and Santley (1979), implied a leadership with exceptional power at this early time. Teotihuacan was already a large urban site, very different from the nearly empty ceremonial center that earlier archaeologists had imagined. Religion undoubtedly was of enormous impor tance throughout the life of the city, but it was increasingly apparent that military themes were prominently (although obliquely) represented in the city's art during later periods (e.g., C. Millon 1973), and it no longer seemed apt to characterize the society as "theocratic." Because virtually no representational art from earlier periods at Teotihuacan is known, it was difficult to say whether warfare had been less important earlier. Thus, by the end of the 1970s, work at the Ciudadela had lagged far behind that in many other parts of Teotihuacan. In general, we had more data about the intermediate and low-sta tus sectors of the society than about those at the highest level. History is not merely an account of the doings of the powerful and mighty, and an adequate understanding of Teotihuacan, whether in historical or more social scientific terms, must pay attention to nonelite elements of the society. Nevertheless, we still know desperately little about the elite of Teotihuacan, and we need to remedy this deficiency. Given the political and reli gious significance of the Ciudadela, the scarcity of studies carried out there using modern techniques had become an increasingly troublesome impediment to efforts to reconstruct Teotihuacan's history, especially its political aspects (e.g., Cowgill 1983; Pasz tory 1988; R. Millon 1981, 1988a, 1988b). Notable difficulties included the absence of reliable information about possible ear lier structures within the pyramid, the chronology of its con struction, and later events including the construction of the Plataforma Adosada and apparent episodes of intentional dam age to the pyramid (Sugiyama 1989a). In addition, some re markable discoveries in the early 1980s suggested that more spectacular discoveries were to be found. The expectation of sensational finds was in itself a further incentive for excavation, but one that did not conflict with a concern for theoretical relevance. WORK AT THE C1UDADELA SINCE GAM IO AND MARQUINA Dosal (1925) found burials of single individuals, presumably sacrificed, in pits outside each of the four corners of the pyra mid (Figure 1). In 1939 Pérez excavated at the foot of the stair way of the pyramid, and dug a pit and extended a tunnel under the stairway at the foot of the Plataforma Adosada (Pérez 1939). Both excavations revealed unusually rich offerings, in cluding several kinds of worked marine shells; projectile points and human and serpent figurines of chipped obsidian; slate disks with traces of pyrite (believed to be mirrors); greenstone objects (at least some of them jadeite), including human figu rines, beads, and earspools; and fragments of human bones, in cluding an upper incisor with pyrite inlay. These finds and possible evidence of an earlier structure covered by the Feath ered Serpent Pyramid were sketchily reported by Rubín de la Borbolla (1947). Ceramic evidence from Test Excavation 19 of the Teotihu acan Mapping Project indicated that the great surrounding plat forms of the Ciudadela were built a short time later than the Sun Pyramid, during the Miccaotli phase (approximately the last half of the second century a.d.) (Rattray 1981), and later excavations of the Proyecto Arqueológico Teotihuacan (80-82) confirm that at least the greater part of these platforms was built as a single operation (Jarquin and Martinez 1982). Evidence for dating the Feathered Serpent Pyramid was more indirect, but it was pretty clearly built not long after the sur rounding platforms of the Ciudadela, since it was stratigraphi cally related to the North and South Palaces (R. Millón, personal communication), and Mapping Project test excava tions in the South Palace and the transverse platform that sep arates the palace from the main plaza of the Ciudadela (TE 25a and 25b) had shown that early palace construction phases dated to the Early Tlamimilolpa phase (estimated by Millón to have lasted from about a.d. 200 to 300). In 1980-1982 an INAH project directed by Cabrera, in ad dition to extensive work in other parts of Teotihuacan, exca vated the South and North Palaces (Cabrera et al. 1982a, 1982b) and dug exploratory trenches in the exterior of the pyr amid (Cabrera and Sugiyama 1982). Between 1983 and 1984, in further INAH work by Cabrera and Sugiyama, three burial pits were found near the southern edge of the pyramid, dug into the consolidated volcanic ash subsoil (tepetate) and partially cov ered by the north wall of the South Palace (Sugiyama 1985a, 1985b, 1989a). The largest of these pits, Burial 190, was about 8 m long, running east-west, centered on the north-south cen tral axis of the pyramid (Figure 1). It contained 18 individuals, all males. Included were 169 obsidian projectile points, over 4,000 pieces of worked shell, and a number of imitation human upper jaws (maxillae) consisting of teeth carved from shell, as well as several real maxillae and mandibles. Nothing like this had ever been reported from Teotihuacan before. Slate disks, resembling objects worn by armed figures in Teotihuacan murals, by monumental stone carvings of soldiers at Tula, and by Aztec soldiers (called tezcacuitlapilli in Nahuatl) were found behind the pelves of several individuals. The arms of many in dividuals were located behind their backs and crossed at the wrists in a position that implies that their hands had been tied. The evidence strongly suggests that these were people with mil</page><page sequence="3">The Templo de Quetzalcoatl Project 79 1'//////////// V f//////&gt;l CENTRAL TUNNEL E-W AXIS SOUTH TUNNEL LOOTERS' TUNNEL ANCIENT PIT BURIAL WITHOUT PIT TEST EXCAVATION Figure 1.

Although more or less fallen over when discov ered, it appears that they had originally been placed in seated positions facing away from the pyramid, as if to guard it and its contents. At short distances east and west of this large pit, two smaller pits were found, each containing a single individual with different offerings. The one on the east (Burial 153) was apparently a fe male. Offerings were limited to 1,606 small worked shells. Burial 203 on the west was male. Offerings included nine large bifacial obsidian projectile points (similar to those in Burial 190) and greenstone beads, earspools, and a "butterfly" nose pendant. Teeth or other worked shells were not found in Burial 203. Stratigraphic evidence shows that all these pits pertain to the time when the pyramid was constructed (Sugiyama 1985a, 1985b, 1989a). A few individual sacrificial burials had previ ously been reported from Teotihuacan, such as the 16 child bu rials associated with the four corners of the Sun Pyramid reported by Batres (Millón, Drewitt, and Bennyhoff 1965:36), but this was the first discovery of a large, multiple sacrificial bu rial at Teotihuacan. Another single individual was found on the north side of the pyramid in 1982, in a location mirroring that of Burial 153 on the south side. Symmetry considerations strongly suggested that another multiple burial similar to Burial 190 would be found on the north side (Sugiyama 1985a, 1985b). Independent work by Martinez and Jarquin in 1986 discovered such a burial, with an other 18 sacrificed individuals, with associated materials gen erally similar to those in Burial 190 (Mercado Rojano 1987; Serrano and Martinez 1987; Sugiyama 1989a: 104-105). THE 1988-1989 EXCAVATIONS In 1988-1989 we conducted further excavations on the east side of the pyramid (the one side not previously explored) and dug a tunnel into the center of the pyramid itself. Other test exca vations were made in and near the Plataforma Adosada and the 1939 excavations of Caso and Pérez were reopened and ex tended. This fieldwork was carried out as a project of INAH, under the direction of Cabrera, with Cowgill as codirector. Sugiyama served as principal assistant. Physical anthropolog ical studies were under the direction of Dr. Carlos Serrano of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Funding for fieldwork was principally from the National Geographic Soci ety, and data analysis is being largely supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, with additional funding from the Arizona State University Foundation and other sources. Our principal objectives were to see whether additional burials were associated with the pyramid, including perhaps some with other types of grave goods, to gain information about possible earlier structures within the pyramid, to see whether the pyra mid was the tomb of an exceptional individual, and to learn more about postconstruction events. Preliminary reports have</page><page sequence="4">80 Cabrera C.( Sugiyama, and Cowgill been published in Mexico (Cabrera et al. 1989; Cabrera, Cow gill, and Sugiyama 1990). Our work has brought the total of known sacrificed individ uals associated with the Feathered Serpent Pyramid to 113 com plete skeletons, in addition to the fragmentary remains of several more individuals. Much of the pyramid and its surroundings re mains unexcavated, and a conservative estimate of the total sac rificed there in a single episode is around 200, including those in burials within and outside the pyramid. Many are associated with weapons and were probably sacrificed soldiers. Most of these were buried wearing collars of cut-shell plaques from which imitation human maxillae were suspended. In a few cases, real human maxillae were used. Many were found with their hands behind their backs and crossed at the wrists, rarely with preserved bits of fiber that seem to be remains of binding material, and it is clear that they had been bound. Although de finitive physical anthropological studies have not been com pleted, no signs of recent trauma have been discovered on the bones, and it is not clear how the victims met their death. Within the pyramid, the contents of several burials were quite different from those we identify as soldiers, reflecting dif ferent social and/or ritual roles and probably higher status of the occupants. Excavations were divided into three broad fronts. Front A, directed by Cabrera, worked on the east side of the pyramid, where no previous scientific excavation had taken place. Front B, directed by Cowgill, conducted a variety of smaller excava tions addressed to specific questions outside the Feathered Ser pent Pyramid and in and near the Plataforma Adosada. Front C was supervised by Sugiyama, under the direction and direct responsibility of Cabrera and Cowgill. It consisted of a tunnel into the pyramid itself. We now turn to a preliminary account of findings on each of these fronts, starting with A, then C, and ending with B. Note that burials were numbered in the order of their discov ery, from 1 through 15, throughout the project, without regard to front. A single number was assigned to each multiple burial and specific individuals were designated by a letter. Thus, in dividual 5-A is the first individual in Burial 5. Ancient pits (fosas) and modern excavations (pozos and calas) were num bered separately in each front. THE EAST SIDE OF THE PYRAMID (FRONT A) On the east side, in work directed by Cabrera, we found about 4 m of debris from the collapse of the pyramid, including many fragments of huge carved stones similar to those known from the other three sides. Ceramics in this debris are predominantly of Teotihuacan age, including a significant number that are Xolalpan or later. Post-Teotihuacan sherds (Coyotlatelco, Mazapan, and Aztec) and Colonial-to-recent sherds are present, but scarce. Surprisingly, a small percentage of sherds appear to be kiln furniture, suggesting pottery production in the vicinity, perhaps in Colonial times. Under this debris were three Teotihuacan concrete floors. Preliminary analysis of ceramics from the 1988 season indicates that the upper two floors date to Xolalpan or possibly Metepec times, while the third (lowest) floor is not later than Tlamimi lolpa. A number of pits dug into tepetate were found under Floor 3, most of them sealed by that floor. Just east of the base of the pyramid we found a small pit in tepetate that contained Burial 3 (Figure 1), apparently a single individual. It had been severely disturbed by a problematic much later structure, perhaps an unfinished noria (cistern) which had penetrated the floors and reached this pit. However, enough material remained in situ to suggest that perhaps the hands had been joined, seemingly tied like so many of the others. East of Burial 3, under the lowest of the Teotihuacan floors, was a very long, narrow, and shallow east-west pit in the tepe tate, about 15 m long, but less than 1 m wide, with almost no surviving contents except two conch shells and the remains of a charred corn cob. In 1988 a pair of north-south pits were found, placed sym metrically on each side of the long narrow pit, Burials 5 and 6 (Figure 1). Each was about 5 m long and held the well-preserved remains of nine individuals. The layout and accompanying ma terials were very similar to those in the multiple burials on the south and north sides of the pyramid, including numerous large and some small obsidian projectile points, great quantities of small worked-shell platelets (mostly reddish) that formed multi strand collars, and other shell (white) worked into imitation teeth. Many of these had evidently been set in stucco (of which only fragments survived) to form imitation maxillae. Most or all of these individuals had slate disks beneath the pelvis at the level of the coccyx. Preliminary analysis of these skeletons by the project phys ical anthropologists indicates that they are male, varying from 20 to 40 years in age at death. Some exhibit cranial deforma tion, and several have dental inlays and/or cosmetic tooth fil ing. The bodies were found lying on their backs, heads along the west side—the side closest to the pyramid. The pits are not wide enough for bodies to have been extended across them, and the legs of the skeletons are somewhat flexed. Once again, fore arms were found under the body, crossed at the wrists or with hands together. One individual in the northern pit, 5-H, second from the northern end, was unusual in several respects. In place of imi tation maxillae, he was buried with a great collar from which depended nine real human maxillae (Figure 2, individual on the left). He exhibits pronounced cranial deformation, while defor mation is moderate in most other well-preserved crania associ ated with the pyramid. It is our impression that his build is unusually gracile compared to that of most of the sacrificed in dividuals. He may have been of different origin, different sta tus, or both. The corresponding skeleton in the pit on the south side of the central axis, 6-H, is also unusual but in a different way. He had associated shell teeth imitating maxillae of canids, possibly coyotes or dogs. Some sherds were incorporated in the fill of the pits, but the only possible ceramic offering consisted of large fragments of a nondescript plain, burnished beaker, hard to date but perhaps of Tlamimilolpa age, found in Burial 6. In 1989 two more burial pits were found, east of and smaller than the pits found in 1988, and located symmetrically north and south of the central east-west axis of the pyramid. Each held four individuals, Burials 10 and 11 (Figure 3). They were generally younger than those in Burials 5 and 6 and were ac companied by poorer furnishings, including single strands of beads made of worked shell, small earspools of shell and other</page><page sequence="5">The Templo de Quetzalcoatl Project 81 Figure 2. Two individuals from Burial 5 on the east side of the pyramid. The individual on the left wears a collar from which nine human maxillae are suspended. material, possibly stuccoed wood, and less abundant obsidian projectile points. Again, because of the width of the pits (av eraging around 1.45 m) the legs were semiflexed. Bodies were on their backs with heads toward the pyramid, and hands be hind the back. Possibly all are female, although project phys ical anthropologists have not yet established sex with certainty in all cases. These persons were surely also sacrificed, but they apparently were of lower status than those in Burials 5 and 6. Further to the east, several other much smaller pits in tepe tate were found under Floor 3. A few had fragmentary remains of pottery vessels, but in general the contents were few and more suggestive of refuse than offerings. Also under Floor 3 were isolated small parts of three individuals, Burials 7, 8, and 9. Probably these pits and burials are unrelated to the pyramid and its dedicatory sacrifices. FRONT C The Front C excavations were conducted in the interior of the base of the pyramid. They were planned and supervised by Sugiyama, under the responsibility of Cabrera and Cowgill. Their principal objectives were (1) to investigate the possibility that additional interments might be discovered under the tem Figure 3. Burial 10 discovered on the east side of the pyramid. Note that all four individuals clearly have their forearms crossed behind their bodies as if they had been bound at the wrists. pie structure which would relate to the burials discovered dur ing previous excavations around the base of the pyramid (specifically, there were reasons to suspect that an important component of the burial complex might be found at the geomet ric center of the pyramid base), (2) to verify the existence of ear lier structures at the same location (Rubin de la Borbolla 1947), (3) to acquire information regarding construction techniques, and (4) to gather additional artifactual materials which might help to date the structure more exactly. The Excavation of the South Tunnel The initial excavation plan involved tunneling into the base of the platform starting at the center point of the south face at the level of the tepetate upon which the pyramid foundations were prepared. From that point, tunneling operations proceeded northward along the central north-south axis of the structure. As our tunnel advanced, it was initially consolidated with wooden beams and planks. Subsequently these were replaced with reinforced concrete pillars supporting steel rails on which concrete cross-slabs were placed, since it was our original inten tion to leave our tunnel open for the use of future researchers. These operations revealed that the pyramid fill was homoge neous throughout. Numerous unfaced, roughly made walls of stone in mud mortar strengthened with plant material ran north-south and east-west, intersecting to form cells, usually somewhat irregular, which had then been filled with more irreg ular stones of varying sizes, also interspersed with a mud preparation. Interior architectural features encountered by excavation in cluded two walled burial chambers, which were evidently un roofed, as they were completely filled with the same rubble and mud used to form the pyramid itself. The first of these (Burial 2) was located 10 m inside, and was bounded on all four sides by vertical walls made of stone and mud mortar (Figure 1). It lacked an entrance. The walls, which were between 1.0 and 1.3 m high, stood on the edges of a long pit whose overall dimensions were 7.8 m long (east-west) by 1.5 m wide (north-south) by 20</page><page sequence="6">82 Cabrera C., Sugiyama, and Cowgill to 30 cm deep. Architectural data related to the burial suggest that the interment was carried out at the time pyramid construc tion was initiated and the following sequence is proposed: (1) excavation of the pit in tepetate, (2) construction of the north ern and southern walls, followed by the eastern and western walls, (3) placement of bodies, (4) covering the bodies by fill ing in the space defined by the four walls with rubble and mud, (5) capping the "chamber" fill with a compact mud layer at the upper limit of the walls, and (6) continuation of the filling pro cess at higher levels for construction of the pyramid itself. Underneath the fill in the chamber were the remains of eight individuals arranged in the shallow pit dug into the tepetate. Owing to the magnitude of damage to the bones and the young age of some individuals, not all sex and age determinations are certain. However, on the basis of field observations, the eight individuals were most likely all males, young adults or sub adults, ranging in age from 10 to 25 years. In those cases in which position could be determined, individuals were in flexed position with their heads the part closest to the center of the pyramid. Some of the individuals were found with the arms and hands positioned as if their hands had been tied behind their backs. Offerings associated with this multiple burial were pro jectile points, shell disks, and shell beads. A second, very similar but longer tomb chamber (Burial 4) was encountered at 13.5 m north from the tunnel entrance. It was at least 18 m long by 1.5 m wide, with walls 1.2 to 1.3 m high, on the edges of a pit 20 to 40 cm deep. Wall construction and conditions inside the chamber were similar to those of Bu rial 2. The character of the burial, however, was different from that of Burial 2 in some important aspects. Eighteen individu als, similarly positioned with their heads toward the center, were accompanied by substantially richer offerings, including projec tile points, 18 slate disks (one per individual), shell beads (some in the form of human teeth), and human and canid jaw bones. The latter include several human maxillae forming a necklace for one individual, and several badly preserved animal jaw bones, whose exact number has yet to be determined, forming the necklace of another individual. The grave-good assemblage appears to be a somewhat standardized one, as other burials as sociated with the Feathered Serpent Pyramid yielded similar combinations of offerings. Nonetheless, some interesting dif ferences in the quality and quantity of offerings among individ uals were observed. Again, there were age differences among the individuals, with more variability than in Burial 2. In those cases in which it was possible to determine sex, it was always male. Exploration of the Looters' Tunnel Beyond these two burial chambers, our tunnel was continued northward toward the center. Along the route of the tunnel, nu merous postholes were found in the natural tepetate layer. While some of these pertain to the construction of the Feath ered Serpent Pyramid, others correspond stratigraphically to earlier structures whose remains were destroyed when the pyr amid was built. At 24 m in, the archaeological tunnel inter sected an ancient tunnel whose existence was not suggested by either the topography of the pyramid mound or any ethnohis torical documents. The tunnel entrance was completely sealed, and apparently had been so for centuries. The tunnel itself was Figure 4. Test excavation in the looters' tunnel inside the pyramid (Front C) showing stratigraphy of the tunnel floor. At the bottom is the natural tepetate, which is overlain by two distinct compacted floor surfaces. The topmost layer of loose dirt and stones reflects the condition of the tunnel floor as we encountered it. a large, irregular hollow passage left by the removal of a large volume of stones and mud by the looters. The discovery of the looters' tunnel forced substantial changes in the original excavation strategy. The existence of the tunnel provided unexpected opportunities to study the pyramid construction more intensively, besides presenting new problems related to the looting episode(s): What happened? How, why, and when did these events occur after the completion of the pyr amid? How long did knowledge of the tunnel's existence per sist? A survey and surface collection of the entire tunnel were made. Test pits were placed along its entire route in order to ob tain stratigraphic data (Figure 4) and any materials that the looters might have left behind, in addition to information con cerning the burials that were found and looted. A great quan tity of building-related features, walls and postholes, of the pyramid construction system were recorded. Evidence concern ing looted burials, as well as a single burial and the remains of an earlier structure with which it is associated, was uncovered near the pyramid center. The looters' tunnel has its origin at the southeast corner of the pyramid (Figure 5). A pit excavated at the southeastern end of the tunnel revealed that, originally, the tunnel had extended farther to the southeast at the same level, and that the tunnel had probably been left open for a long time. The tunnel runs diagonally toward the center but misses the exact center by 2 m (Figure 1). West of the central north-south axis, the looters' tunnel passes over a large burial pit, Burial 12, which was looted, and then procedes further westward where a still larger burial pit, Burial 13, was encountered and looted. At this point, three branches of the tunnel go north, south, and west from Bu rial 13, and another short branch extends north from the area around Burial 12. Burial 12 was found at 3 m west-southwest of the pyramid center. The burial pit was square in outline (3 m by 3 m) and dug to a depth of 0.9 m into the natural tepetate. It had been looted almost completely, except for a small portion around the northeastern corner. The stratigraphy of the pit consisted mainly of horizontal layers of the secondary fill redeposited by</page><page sequence="7">The Templo de Quetzalcoatl Project 83 Figure 5. View of the southeasternmost end of the looters' tunnel. the looters after they had emptied the pit of nearly all its orig inal contents. But it also presents complicated stratigraphic re lations in association with layers pertaining to remnants of a prepyramid structure found in the vicinity of Burial 12. The data are too complicated to be described adequately in this brief preliminary report. The stratigraphic sequence indicates, how ever, that Burial 12 may be associated with the time of the con struction of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid, but the possibility also exists that the burial pit originally had been made sometime after the prepyramid structure but before the initiation of the pyramid construction, so that it may have already been looted once before being reused as a burial pit at the time of pyramid construction. The final disturbance (not counting our own ex cavation), attributable to looting inside the pyramid, has seri ously impaired our ability to unravel the entire stratigraphic sequence because the excavation of the looters' tunnel involved the nearly complete removal of the original layers in and above the pit. A small quantity of human bone fragments and offerings disturbed by looters were found in the lowest layers in the re fill of the pit. Impressions of human bones in the tepetate floor also confirm its function as a multiple burial pit. The offerings discovered in the lower layers include fragments of obsidian projectile points, shell and greenstone beads, fragments of greenstone earplugs, slate disk fragments, animal bones, canine teeth, carbon, a stucco fragment of hemispherical shape, and traces of red pigment on the bones and floor. Near the northeast corner of the pit in what remained of the original fill, bones belonging to a human adult (probably male) were discovered in correct anatomical relationship to one an other. Although the skeleton was incomplete, the bones indicate that the individual was buried in dorsal position with an east west orientation. Also, the hands seem to have been tied behind the individual's back. Therefore, we believe that Burial 12 con sisted of several individuals who were very probably sacrificed like the others found in the pyramid. The associated offerings include a slate anthropomorphic figurine, an unworked spiral shell, and shell and greenstone beads. Small portions of two Teotihuacan-type floors were seen in the wall of the looters' tunnel near the western edge of the Burial 12 pit. Beneath these traces of earlier structures, the burial of a single individual (Burial 15) was represented by only the pelvis, vertebral column, and an incomplete set of right ribs in correct anatomical position, with the partial cranium of an animal occupying the position of the heart. The con dition in which the bones were discovered suggests execution by heart sacrifice, perhaps related to an earlier structure at the site. Also along the route of the looters' tunnel, approximately 9 m west of the pyramid's center and positioned on the central east west axis of the pyramid, we encountered another large burial pit (Burial 13). Excavated into the tepetate, this pit was qua drangular and measured 4.3 m (east-west) by 3.9 m (north south). Its depth was 1.5 m. This pit had obviously been disturbed by looting and subsequently refilled by the looters. Only a small portion of the original pit fill was identifiable near the western edge. The original pit-fill material is the same type of material as that which forms the rubble fill of the pyramid. This clearly sug gests that the burial episode was related to pyramid-construction activities. The stratigraphy of the area in and around the burial pit indicates that Burial 13 was looted first, and later the looters' tunnel was extended to areas north, south, and west of Burial 13. The remains of one complete and one partial skeleton were preserved in the primary (original) fill which remained undis turbed at the bottom of the Burial 13 pit. Furthermore, a few impressions of bones in correct anatomical relation were visible on the underlying natural tepetate pit "floor." Over this floor was a layer consisting mainly of loose stones, in whose lower part a considerable quantity of fragmented bone was recovered along with some grave offerings. The information rescued from the looted pit confirms that it was originally a multiple burial whose occupants were accompanied by high-status offerings. Completion of the osteological analysis should provide an es timate of the minimum number of individuals represented in this collection, who are most certainly the original grave oc cupants. Grave goods, retrieved from the same context as the human bone, include objects of obsidian: projectile points, a miniature knife, blades, and eccentrics with serpent forms among others; greenstone including beads, a noseplug, and sev eral plaques; unworked whole shells, and worked shell pieces, some in the form of disks or imitation human teeth; a slate disk; yellow, red, and white pigments; fragments of wood and fibers, including the fragile remains of a basket bottom; and an imal fangs. The complete skeleton was discovered in the original fill near the west edge of the pit, an adult male, unusually robust, bur ied face- and belly-down with the knees tucked under the chest (Figure 6). An interesting feature of this individual's interment, which likely accounts for its unusually good preservation as well, is the arrangement of stones made around the body which apparently was intended to serve to protect and/or isolate this individual in a real and/or symbolic sense. This individual also possessed an unusual and fine assortment of grave goods: a pair of greenstone earspools of particularly large size, twenty-one large greenstone beads, and a rectangular nose pendant of</page><page sequence="8">84 Cabrera C., Sugiyama, and Cowgill Figure 6. Remains of individual E from Burial 13 in flexed ventral position and surrounded by a protective arrangement of rocks. About top center of the photograph the unusually large earspools can be seen. greenstone which features a distinctive bifurcated, tonguelike projection below the rectangular plaque. In addition, this male was accompanied by a large obsidian eccentric which apparently combines a projectile point form with a stylized serpent's head. The distinctiveness of this individual (in terms of his physical type, burial context, and content) suggests superior social rank relative to the other sacrificial victims associated with the pyr amid. The other individual was still partially intact in the original fill of Burial 13, but no associated offerings were discovered. Generally speaking, the offerings discovered in the fill rede posited by the looters were rather different from those discovered elsewhere in the pyramid burials. A particularly interesting object found in the pit was a carved wooden baton measuring 58 cm long and 2.5 to 6.5 cm wide which was preserved in its entirety (Figure 7). The carved end depicts a feathered serpent head, an image duplicated on the reverse side. The almost unavoidable impression is that the piece is related to the "manikin scepter" carried by many Maya rulers. The presence of this object strengthens the case for the uniqueness of Burial 13, as well as the argument for attributing very high status, possibly sacerdo tal, to the deceased. This interpretation is uncertain, however, because the wooden baton was an isolated find in one of the up per layers of the secondary fill deposited by the looters. This by no means precludes the possibility that the baton was part of the original burial offering, but it leaves the interpretation open to question. Due to the type of material and its excellent state of preservation, however, clarifying its chronological associa tion was possible via AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry) C 14 dating. The two dates obtained are in good agreement with one another, and they furnish a calibrated, weighted mean of about a.d. 70, with a two-sigma spread from 50 b.c. to a.d. 140 (Beta Analytic lab numbers, Beta-37833 and Beta-37834). The dates support the idea that the baton may originally have been a personal object belonging to an individual in Burial 13 which served as a symbol of his sociopolitical status. The looters' tunnel's northern and western extensions con tained only a few scattered objects, which might have been part of offerings, within the levels associated with looters' activities. Further evidence of other burials was not found in these areas. Nonetheless, a noteworthy observation was that at the farthest end of the northern extension the lower parts of the tunnel, walls, and floor were quite humid, in marked contrast to the dry conditions at other locations within the pyramid. In this area, small amounts of saltpeterlike, white paste were found on several damp walls and stones. Test excavations were made on the floor of the looters' tunnel to determine whether a spring could be detected, but we were unable to clarify the source of the humidity. The southern extension seems to have been made after the looting of Burial 13 and before the excavation of the northern and western extensions. Test pits again revealed more of the re mains of the prepyramid substructures. These remains consisted of small areas of typical Teotihuacan concrete and earth floors and plastered walls. Although the stratigraphy clearly indicates that these structural features correspond to an architectural feature predating the Feathered Serpent Pyramid, only a few sherds were recovered on which to base a temporal assignment. Excavation at the Pyramid's Center Given the failure of the looters' tunnel to pass through the ex act center of the pyramid base, we took advantage of its prox imity to the center to explore the central area. We initiated a new tunnel excavation starting at the east wall of the looters' tunnel about 3 m north of Burial 12 in order to see whether a companion pit for the Burial 12 pit would be found on the northern side of the central east-west axis (Figure 1). Running eastward for 6 m, the new archaeological tunnel cut through seven walls which constituted parts of the construction system of the pyramid. At 5 m the discovery of a projectile point in association with human bone on the tepetate floor tem porarily halted eastward penetration in favor of a continuation to the south at this point. In the area immediately south of the east-west archaeological tunnel, at the exact center of the pyr amid base, a 20-person multiple burial (Burial 14) was unearthed with the richest offerings known to date from Teotihuacan (Fig ure 8). Unlike any of the other burials pertaining to the pyra mid construction, the persons in this central group were not placed in burial pits, but were simply laid on top of the hard tepetate and covered, like the others under the pyramid, with stones and mud. There was evidence that some sort of crude, roughly domelike, structural arrangement of rocks was intended to define and/or protect this central burial area, but we have in sufficient data to describe it very precisely. The stratigraphic re lations between the oval-shaped burial site and the walls built above it indicate that the individuals were placed there at the</page><page sequence="9">The Templo de Quetzalcoatl Project 85 Figure 7. Carved wooden baton found complete in the redeposited fill of the Burial 13 pit. Figure 8. View of some of the remains from Burial 14 at the pyramid's center illustrating that abundant offerings were found distributed over the bodies and not in specific association with any single one. In fact, many skel etons partially overlay others. onset of construction of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid. Our excavation data do not admit the possibility that the interment was carried out after construction. Stratigraphically, there is no doubt that all 20 individuals, along with their associated offer ings, correspond to a single burial event. There is no evidence for alteration or disturbance of the primary burial context. Burial 14 extends 5 m east-west by 3 m north-south. Of the 20 individuals discovered in intact condition within it, all were adults, and most or all were males. Presently, physical anthro pologists for the project are undertaking a detailed analysis of the skeletal material to determine age, sex, pathology, and per haps ethnic identity. The positions and orientations of the 20 individuals were diverse and complicated. They were buried with little space between them, and some, whose bodies par tially overlay those of others, seemed to have been intentionally positioned that way. Ritual symbolism probably played an important role in the burial arrangement. The individuals appeared to be aligned on the east-west axis rather than on the north-south one. Six skel etons, five in dorsal extended position and one in tightly flexed lateral position, were aligned exactly on the east-west axis of the pyramid. Eight skeletons on the north side were positioned dif ferently, but generally were oriented in an east-west or ESE WNW direction. That is, their heads were directed toward the easternmost individual in the group. Quite possibly some indi viduals may have been buried in a seated position, and later toppled over as they were covered by the stone and mud fill. Six individuals on the south side of the axis were similarly oriented toward the ENE, that is, again toward the easternmost individ ual. Overall, their spatial distribution gives the impression that the easternmost individual had some particular significance. In other respects, however, this individual does not appear to have been treated specially. Moreover, he was one of the ten people in the group who were found with hands and arms positioned behind the back or pelvis as if they had been tied. In general, the distribution of offerings among the individuals does not provide clear evidence for status differences among them. De spite the outstanding richness of the burial offerings, we incline to the opinion that the occupants of the central burial were also victims of sacrifice performed on the occasion of the com mencement of pyramid construction. The offerings were distributed throughout the entire inter ment zone. Most were placed directly on top of the skeletons, although some items were found alongside or between bones, and fewer yet beneath the bodies. A complete description of the offering assemblage is not yet possible. Numerous items suffered damage from stones in the fill, and require conservatorial at tention before analysis can proceed. Nevertheless, a preliminary inventory of the burial offering content is adequate to illustrate its sumptuous character. At least 400 greenstone objects were recovered, including eighteen enigmatic objects of conical form (Figure 9), earspools, nose pendants, figurines, beads, and headdresslike plaques [called resplandores by Rubín de la Bor bolla (1947)]. The more than 800 obsidian objects include projec tile points, prismatic blades (many over 20 cm long), perforators, bifacial knives (the largest measuring 20 cm in length), and min iature bifacial knives, as well as anthropomorphic and zoo morphic eccentrics of diverse forms (Figure 10). Shell items, both unworked and worked pieces, number over 3,400; most are beads, but pendants and earspools are also represented in this category. Slate disks of different sizes were present among the remains, as well as some animal bone, which is probably</page><page sequence="10">86 Cabrera C., Sugiyama, and Cowgill Figure 9. A concentration of offerings, discovered in Burial 14, which in cludes eighteen greenstone cones, as well as greenstone earspools, shell beads, and miniature obsidian bifacial knives. The cones are about 5 cm high. Figure 10. Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic obsidian eccentrics recov ered from Burial 14. canid. Organic remains in the form of whole plants and seeds, worked wooden objects, fibers, and what appear to be the re mains of textiles were common. The only ceramic find was the incomplete remains of a "Tlaloc" vessel. Some ornaments and offerings, such as shell plaques, small spiral shells and jade beads, earspools, nose pendants, obsid ian knives, several groups of projectile points, and the remains of wooden objects (batons?), seem rather certainly to have been associated with specific individuals. However, virtually all the offerings found on top of the skeletons evidently were placed over the mass of bodies without consideration for relating them to particular individuals. Although offering materials were dis persed throughout the entire burial, some kinds of materials were discovered only in discrete locations. For example, the eighteen greenstone cones (Figure 9), an offering type previously unknown, were found together in one small area (20 cm by 30 cm) between two individuals, near, but not at, the center point of the burial. Large spiral shells were found in the central and southwestern parts of the burial exclusively. Figure 11. One of the sets of objects found in a possible bag in Burial 14. At several different locations within the burial we found spe cial sets of objects, each of which contained a more or less stan dardized combination of objects (Figure 11). The "set" consists of one figurine, two earspools, beads, one resplandor, one bi valve with two holes, one spiral shell, and several (usually eight) miniature obsidian bifacial knives. In most instances, these sets were found on, or partially surrounded by, a vegetable mate rial (which may include textile fragments) that had been placed over a row of long obsidian prismatic blades placed side by side. At this stage of analysis, nine such sets have been identified. We assume that the organic material may be the remains of bags in which the sets of objects were placed or wrapped. Our recon struction of this offering type will be enhanced upon comple tion of the analyses of the organic materials and soil samples. As a general conclusion for the initial stage of our analysis, we are strongly inclined to believe that the offerings should be considered collectively as an explicit manifestation of a ritual symbol set. Therefore, the social and/or political status re flected in the offerings must be interpreted cautiously. The of ferings may pertain more to the sociopolitical relations of the people responsible for the burials than to those buried, who were very probably sacrificed. Ongoing analyses of the offer ings themselves and their spatial distributions, as well as stud ies of the osteological material, will supply more information in this respect. In order to verify whether a pit corresponding to that con taining Burial 13 existed with respect to the north-south axis of</page><page sequence="11">The Templo de Quetzalcoatl Project 87 the pyramid, excavation was continued to the east beyond Bu rial 14 (Figure 1). The excavation only uncovered more roughly made walls of the construction system of the pyramid and no other burial pit was discovered. Again, the uniqueness of Bu rial 13 appears to be confirmed. Upon completion of archaeological exploration in the tun nels within the pyramid, we backfilled the pits we had excavated and consolidated areas of the looters' tunnel where necessary. In compliance with a decision made by the Consejo de Ar queología of INAH in 1989, all the tunnels excavated by the project were completely filled in with the same material re moved from them. The looters' tunnel was resealed completely and is once more inaccessible. FRONT B Several additional operations were carried out under the direc tion of Cowgill in 1988 to investigate specific problems. North of the pyramid, just west of the pit with 18 individuals exca vated by Martinez and Jarquin in 1986, we excavated Burial 1, a deep pit in tepetate, sealed by several concrete floors. Its lo cation mirrors that of Burial 203 on the south side of the pyr amid (Sugiyama 1989a:95, Fig. 8). Its contents were quite similar, including ten obsidian projectile points, nineteen green stone beads, two earspools with traces of pink stucco, and a "butterfly" nose pendant. But it also contained thousands of tiny shells, probably once attached to a garment. The body, male, aged around 20 at death, had been interred seated, fac ing west, and the lower part covered with fine, dark earth, af ter which the bulk of the pit was filled with coarser materials. Seven small test pits east of the known burials on the north side of the pyramid failed to find more burials (Figure 1). Al most surely there were none between those now known and the corner burials reported by Dosal (1925). Pit 2, atop the Plataforma Adosada, intended to date that structure, was carried down more than 5 m, mostly in loose, rocky fill. Only the lowest layers were undisturbed deposits. The uppermost part of the fill is from Gamio and Marquina's res toration, but it also appears that a huge looters' trench had been dug along the central axis of the platform at some time in the past. Ceramics in at least the uppermost 1.5 m included a few unmistakable Aztec sherds, and Colonial sherds occur to a depth of at least 1.2 m. Ceramics in the lowest levels, however, are mostly Tlamimilolpa and Miccaotli, with about 5% identi fied as possibly Xolalpan. The most striking discovery in Pit 2 was many fragments of intricately modeled, fired-clay walls, some quite large (Fig ure 12). This is another unprecedented type of find at Teotihu acan. Stylistically they are unquestionably Teotihuacan. They must be from a razed structure, and probably they formed part of a frieze adorning its facade. There is little doubt that a tem ple would have originally stood atop the Feathered Serpent Pyr amid, although the top is so eroded that no data on this question survive. It is tempting to think that such a temple may have been razed when the Plataforma Adosada was built and fragments of the temple used in the fill of the platform. Another operation, Pit 3, reopened the 1939 excavation and tunnel at the foot of the stairway of the Plataforma Adosada. We obtained ceramic samples important for dating the three concrete floors in the Great Plaza of the Ciudadela. The earli 0 20cm Figure 12. Fragments of modeled and fired clay from the Plataforma Adosada. est dates to Miccaotli or, at latest, the very beginning of the Early Tlamimilolpa phase. By widening the 1939 tunnel under the stairway, we found additional rich offerings and traced the outlines of several small offering pits. The contents are very similar to those reported by Rubin de la Borbolla (1947) and in clude a conch shell, worked shell, obsidian, a greenstone figu rine with tiny detachable earspools and a stepped resplandor fitting on the back of the head, and greenstone beads, nose pen dants, and earspools. The materials are also extremely similar to those found in the burials associated with the Feathered Ser pent Pyramid. Although the stratigraphic situation is complex, there is strong evidence that these small offering pits underneath the stairway of the Plataforma Adosada actually pertain to the earlier pyramid, as suggested earlier by Sugiyama (1989a). We now know that pits associated with that pyramid extended some distance away from it on the east side, and it appears that an even more extensive pattern of offerings existed on the west side. We also reopened the 1939 excavation at the foot of the pyr amid stairway (Pit 5). We found no evidence of an earlier struc</page><page sequence="12">88 Cabrera C., Sugiyama, and Cowgill Figure 1 3. Excavation at foot of stairway of the Feathered Serpent Pyr amid showing irregular foundation stones previously misinterpreted as an earlier stairway. Stones of actual stairway are at extreme upper left. ture; the supposed earlier structure seems to stem from misinterpretation of some roughly cut stones forming a foun dation for the present pyramid (Figure 13). This agrees with the evidence from our tunnel into the pyramid, where only traces of earlier structures were found relatively near the center. In Pit 5 we did, however, find the remains of an ancient, large rectan gular pit in the tepetate west of the stairway. Because it is now covered by the loose fill of the Plataforma Adosada, technical problems precluded our determining its full extent, but it is about 90 cm deep, 5.4 m north-south, and more than 4.2 m east-west. It had been looted and filled with loose rubble in which we found no recent materials. This area was inaccessible before Gamio's excavations, so it must have been looted before the platform was built. Thus, it adds to the picture of extensive early looting. The large ancient pit, like Burial 13, is on the cen terline of the pyramid, and it probably contained remains of great significance including, possibly, some individual of great importance. Pit 4 was dug in apparently in situ deposits sealed by a sur viving section of concrete floor on the top of the lowest tablero of the stepped Plataforma Adosada, in a further effort to date that structure. Upper layers contained a small number of Xolal pan phase diagnostics such as San Martin Orange. The ceram ics in lower layers are predominantly Tlamimilolpa, with a considerable admixture of Miccaotli sherds, but percentages of Miccaotli are lower than in collections from the pyramid. How ever, 5% to 10% of the sherds are tentatively identified as Xolalpan. The remains of a mud-faced talud suggest that the constructional history of the platform is complex. If so, the ma terial from its earliest stages is very poorly represented by our excavations. Finally, Pit 6 was opened in the Great Plaza of the Ciuda dela, at the northwest corner of the Plataforma Adosada, to search for a burial there, analogous to the burials found at the corners of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid. None was found, which is consistent with the possibility that the platform's con struction marked a change in political climate and less empha sis on dedicatory sacrifices. We found, however, under concrete floors, the earliest of which is probably Miccaotli, a shallow ir regular pit in the tepetate containing soft, ashy soil with several large sherds of finely decorated vessels of the Tzacualli phase, substantially earlier than known major construction in the Ciudadela. This pit was only partially excavated. It may be a dump rather than an offering, but in any case it adds to our very scanty knowledge of the earliest occupation here, and the spot is a strategic place for future excavations. In another operation supervised by Cowgill, the surface of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid was gridded into 10 m by 10 m squares, and intensive surface collections were made. Prelimi nary analyses of the ceramics show that although there are slight admixtures of later materials of various periods up to the present, the overall composition of the collections is remarkably similar to those from our tunnel at the base of the pyramid. This adds further support to the evidence that the pyramid was built in a single operation over a fairly short time, and it also strongly suggests that there was never any significant later oc cupation, either in Teotihuacan times or subsequently. A puz zling observation was a number of sherds that, like some of those found in the rubble above the concrete floors east of the pyramid (Front A), have been subjected to great heat. Most likely these are kiln furniture. PRELIMINARY CERAMIC ANALYSIS AND CHRONOLOGY Ceramics were nearly absent in the undisturbed burials we ex cavated, except for the fragments of a "Tlaloc" vessel in Burial 14 and a poorly made beaker in Burial 6. However, numerous and sometimes fitting sherds in the backdirt of the looters' tun nel strongly suggest that several relatively fine ceramic vessels had accompanied one or more of the burials and structures se verely damaged by the looters. All this ceramic material is con sistent with the moderately abundant sherds incorporated in the fill of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid itself, and strongly indi cates that the burials and the construction of the pyramid took place either in the Miccaotli phase or very early in the Tlamimi lolpa phase. At present the differences between Miccaotli and Early Tlamimilolpa are not extremely well understood, and it is likely that there was a continuum of change and that detailed analysis of our materials will help to refine the Miccaotli-earliest Tlamimilolpa chronology. The transition between Early and Late Tlamimilolpa is more sharply defined. Preliminary anal yses are not yet available for all ceramics from the 1989 season,</page><page sequence="13">The Templo de Quetzalcoatl Project 89 but so far a number of markers of Late Tlamimilolpa and later periods seem wholly absent from layers firmly connected to the pyramid. These include such categories as cylindrical tripod vases, candeleros of all types, moldmade censer ornaments, and San Martin Orange. On the other hand, monochrome black and dark brown outcurving bowls and vases with solid nubbin sup ports and everted lips are well represented, although lighter brown examples are not uncommon. Most of these forms are plain, but some have fine-line incising in dry clay, often cross hatched. Curvilinear incising done when the clay was still soft is rarer but also occurs. Red-slipped vessels, sometimes with specular hematite, are rare but definitely present. Tlaloc jars, besides the fragmentary one included in Burial 14, are repre sented by a number of sherds in the pyramid, as are floreros. Rare, imported types include Thin Orange (including a few sherds of Coarse Thin Orange), Lustrous Ware (from the Gulf Coast, probably the northern or central part), and Granular Ware (perhaps from Guerrero). Several Fine Matte Ware sherds belong to shallow plates or covers. DISCUSSION One of the questions we set out to answer was the existence of earlier structures within the pyramid. Clear evidence of earlier construction was found (postholes and some fragments of floors and walls), but its nature is very unclear because it was nearly all destroyed and the present pyramid was, except in very limited areas, built directly on tepetate. The pyramid, as it stands, represents a single stage of construction, in the Miccaotli phase or very early in the Tlamimilolpa phase. The question of whether a head of state or other person of great importance was buried at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid is of great significance for our picture of Teotihuacan society. Possibly Burial 13 and/or the great looted pit west of the pyr amid stairway once contained such a person or persons, and it is possible that a major burial might still exist in the area be tween these two pits. It is also possible that no such principal individual was ever buried at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid. We hope that further analysis of our material can settle this question. Another key question is the identity of the sacrificial victims. For many (especially those in the multiple burials outside the pyramid and in Burials 2 and 4), their age (juveniles or young adults), sex (male), accoutrements (maxillae pendant from col lars and pyrite mirrors on slate disks), and the accompanying projectile points and virtual absence of other imperishable of ferings (such as ceramics) strongly suggest that they were sol diers. An obvious possibility is that they were foreign captives. In the opinion of biological anthropologists we have consulted, osteological differences among diverse mesoamerican popula tions are large enough so that, as a group, if not in every indi vidual case, we should be able to distinguish between highland central Mexican populations and the Maya and other lowland groups. Our first impression is that most of the individuals we have excavated are biologically much like those in other Teoti huacan samples (though perhaps with above-average health and nutritional histories) and decidedly different from Maya skel etal samples. Burial 5-H, however, seems more likely to be of nonlocal origin. Another possibility is that the victims were captive foreign ers from other highland societies, biologically much more sim ilar to the Teotihuacanos. It is also conceivable (as suggested by Lillian Thomas) that the victims belonged to a defeated faction in some internal struggle within the city. It is difficult to say if purely biological data will enable us to distinguish between Teotihuacanos and other highland populations, but we will at tempt to look for such a distinction. Cultural evidence suggests that the victims were not defeated foreigners. They were buried in pits outside of or in the outer parts of the pyramid, and placed facing outwardly, as if to de fend its contents. The situation is reminiscent of some burials accompanying early rulers in other societies, such as the Shang Dynasty royal burials at An-yang (Chang 1980) and the Early Dynastic Sumerian royal burials at Ur (Woolley 1954). We may be dealing with the sacrifice of loyal retainers to accompany a deceased ruler, although this is certainly not the only possibility. Studies of sex, age, and grave goods of those who appear not to be soldiers are especially important since, if the proposed analogy is valid, we would expect to find servants, wives, and other members of the royal household, including perhaps some of quite high rank. Several lines of evidence suggest that not long after the Feathered Serpent Pyramid was built, there were significant changes in the political organization of Teotihuacan (Cabrera 1987; Cowgill 1983, 1990; R. Millón 1988a, 1988b; Pasztory 1988; Sugiyama 1985b). Possibly the ideological basis of ruler ship shifted. As far as we know, later instances of mass sacrifi cial burials did not occur at Teotihuacan. Sacrifice itself is very well attested in later murals, but it seems to have been on a smaller scale and part of fertility, military, and other rituals that were not occasioned by the death or burial of a ruler. Unam biguous examples of the celebration of exalted rulers are not known in Teotihuacan art. Although marked differences in wealth and prestige are indicated by many lines of evidence, nearly all the population came to be housed in substantial apart ment compounds, and relations of superordination and subor dination are not obvious in Teotihuacan art, in marked contrast to that of the Classic Maya. Several scholars (e.g., Cowgill 1983, 1990; R. Millón 1988b; Pasztory 1988) postulate an early period of autocratic rulers, followed by a shift to more empha sis on a collective, group-oriented ethos, soon after the build ing of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid. This postulated change in Teotihuacan politics, society, and ideology is plausible for a number of reasons. Nevertheless, the evidence in its support, although of diverse kinds, is not over whelming. The data from our work at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid can contribute greatly to testing, modifying, and elaborating, or possibly casting doubt on, this outline of events. For example, if it really appears that there was no single prin cipal individual among those buried at the pyramid, it would suggest that even early Teotihuacan was not characterized by exalted individual rulers, since no other structures of the period approach the pyramid in size or quality of construction, and it is highly unlikely that a person of supreme importance at that time would have been buried anywhere else. On the other hand, clear evidence of such a burial would support the hypothesis of exalted and very powerful early rulers. There is also the evidence provided by the construction of the Plataforma Adosada. This large platform did not totally hide the Feathered Serpent Pyramid, but it did, in effect, put it into a "backstage" position. The ancient looters' tunnel itself need not mark a change of regime or ideology, since there are other instances of surreptitiously looted burials without major</page><page sequence="14">90 political disruption (e.g., the Royal Tombs at Ur, and many Egyptian examples), yet an accurate date for the looting will bear on our hypotheses about Teotihuacan society and politics. Preliminary studies of ceramics from the Plataforma Adosada raise the possibility that it was built as much as two centuries after the completion of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid, and the looting may possibly have taken place at the same time. More accurate dating of both these events should be possible through Cabrera C., Sugiyama, and Cowgill a combination of ceramic chronology, radiocarbon dating, and obsidian hydration studies. In sum, although much of the material we have recovered is of great intrinisic interest because of the exotic material and the level of craftmanship represented, it is of even greater impor tance for its relevance to ideas about the society, ideology, and politics of early Teotihuacan. SUMARIO Los trabajos de Gamio y Marquina entre 1918 y 1922 hicieron de la Ciudadela uno de los complejos arquitectónicos mejor estudiados en Teotihuacán. Sin embargo, en las décadas siguientes muy poco trabajo se realizó ahí, excepto por las excavaciones a pequeña escala de Dosal, Caso, y Pérez, y las colecciones de superficie y excavaciones de sondeo por el "Mapping Project" de Millón. Hacia finales de los setentas, la escasez de datos comparativos de La Ciudadela fue un serio im pedimento en los intentos por comprender la historia política y social de Teotihuacán. Durante 1980-1982, un proyecto del INAH dirigido por Cabrera llevó a cabo excavaciones intensivas en La Ciudadela, y excavó dos costados del Templo de Quetzalcoatl (al cual nos referimos aquí como Pirámide de las Serpientes Emplumadas, como es recomendado por los autores en Berrin 1988, para evitar las cuestiones acerca del grado de paralelismo entre los conceptos teotihuacanos y los aztecas). Entre 1983 y 1984, en trabajos subsecuentes del INAH por Cabrera y Sugiyama, tres fosas de enterramiento fueron encontradas en el lado sur de la pirá mide. Una de ellas contenía 18 individuos, claramente sacrificados, con ricas ofrendas de puntas de proyectil y conchas marinas, muchas de éstas últimas talladas en forma de dientes humanos. En 1986 otros ar queólogos encontraron un entierro múltiple similar en el lado norte de la pirámide. Todas estas fosas fueron estratigráficamente asociadas con la pirámide misma. Durante 1988-1989, los autores llevaron a cabo excavaciones por parte del INAH, sobre el lado este (posterior) de la pirámide y excava ron un túnel hacia el centro de la misma. Este trabajo ha resultado en un total de 113 esqueletos completos de personas sacrificadas, asi como fragmentos de algunas otras. Las personas, ahí sacrificadas en una sola ocasión durante la fase Miccaotli o Tlamimilolpa temprano, deben haber sido alrededor de 200. Al este de la pirámide, encontramos cerca de 4 m. de escombros del derrumbe de la misma pirámide. Debajo de estos, había tres pisos de concreto teotihuacanos. La cerámica fecha los dos pisos superiores en la fase Xolalpan o posiblemente Metepec, pero el tercero no es posterior a Tlamimilolpa. Estos pisos sellaban varios pozos excavados en el tepe tate. Los más notables fueron dos, los Entierros 5 y 6, cada uno de los cuales contenía nueve individuos de sexo masculino con edades entre los 20 y 40 años. Estos presentaban numerosas puntas de proyectil y con chas trabajadas, incluyendo imitaciones de maxilares con dientes de con cha. Una persona tenía asociados nueve maxilares reales de humanos. Los entierros 10 y 11 contenían cuatro individuos cada uno, con ata víos menos ricos. A 10 m hacia adentro desde la fachada sur de la pirámide, nuestro túnel encontró un entierro multiple de 8 individuos en un pozo muy poco profundo en el tepetate, rodeado por muros de piedra que for maban parte del sistema de construcción de la base de la pirámide. Esta cámara no tenía techo; luego de que los cuerpos fueron enterrados fue rellenada con piedras y lodo, y la construcción de la pirámide continuó sobre del mismo. A 13.5 m fue encontrada una segunda tumba, muy similar excepto que más larga, con 18 individuos sacrificados los cuales mostraban ofrendas de caracter militarista. A los 24 m nuestro túnel encontro un antiguo túnel de saqueo, cuya entrada sellada estaba en la esquina sureste de la pirámide. Este túnel corre diagonalmente hacia el centro de la pirámide pasando a dos metros cerca del mismo. No lejos del centro, el túnel de saqueo encontró dos grandes fosas de entierro antiguas. Los saqueadores removieron casi todo el contenido, aunque dejaron lo suficiente para inferir que varios individuos fueron sepultados en cada fosa, al menos algunos de ellos con ricas ofrendas poco comunes de piedra verde y otros materiales, bastante diferentes de aquellas que acompañaban a los posibles guer reros descritos antes. En el relleno posterior de una de estas fosas en contramos un bastón de madera que dio una fecha de radiocarbono alrededor de 70 d.C. (calibrada). Extendimos nuestro túnel hacia el centro exacto de la pirámide, donde encontramos un entierro intacto de 20 individuos, de sexo mas culino. Estos tienen ricas ofrendas funerarias que incluyen gran número de conchas trabajadas y sin trabajar, implementos de obsidiana, figurillas, y ornamentos de piedra verde entre los cuales hay 18 objetos cónicos no reportados hasta hoy en Mesoamérica. Los excavaiones dentro y cerca de la plataforma construida posteri ormente sobre el frente de la Pirámide de las Serpientes Emplumadas descubrieron otro gran pozo de saqueo justo al frente de la escalinata de la pirámide. Se comprobó que las ofrendas encontradas bajo la es calinata de la plataforma de hecho fechan a la pirámide misma. Los análisis preliminares de la cerámica procedente de la plataforma sugieren que pudo haber sido construida posiblemente dos siglos después de la pirámide. Nuestro túnel dentro de la pirámide también reveló algunas huellas de estructuras más tempranas, pero muy poco quedó de éstas. La pirá mide, tal como la conocemos hoy, fue construida durante una sola gran operación en el tiempo de los sacrificios múltiples. A causa del daño hecho por los saqueadores, aun no hemos podido determinar si algún personaje principal de gran importancia fue alguna vez enterrado dentro de la pirámide. Si éste fué o no el caso, la misma escala de los sacrifi cios sugiere que durante ese tiempo hubo una autoridad central muy poderosa en Teotihuacán. Esto, a su vez, es relevante para el argumento de que los patrones adoptados por la sociedad teotihuacana tardía, fue ron la reacción a un periodo de "despotismo." ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The fieldwork on which this paper is based was carried out as a project of the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH), with the participation of Brandéis University. Principal funding was provided by the National Geographic Society. Archaeological supervisory person nel for one or both seasons were Rodolfo Cid, Oralia Cabrera, Alejan dro Sarabia, Jorge Mota, and Héctor Lara of the Escuela Nacional de Antropología e Historia (ENAH); and Lillian Thomas, Martin Dudek, and Stephanie Reiss, all graduate students in the Department of Anthro pology, Brandéis University. Dr. Carlos Serrano of the Instituto de In vestigaciones Antropológicas of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (IIA-UNAM) directed physical anthropological work by Martha Pimienta, Alfonso Gallardo, Francisco Hoffman, and Andrés</page><page sequence="15">The Templo de Quetzalcoatl Project 91 de Angel, all of ENAH. Dra. Emily McClung de Tapia, of IIA-UNAM, supervised collection and processing of palaeobotanical materials by Vir ginia Betz (then of UNAM, now of Arizona State University), who also aided in photo processing. Josefina Barajas M., of the Instituto de Bi ología of UNAM, identified the wood of the baton found in the fill of Burial 13. In 1989 Donald Booth of Brandéis handled photography and some archaeological supervision. Throughout, Sres. Pedro Baños and Ceferino Ortega, senior technicians of the Teotihuacan Archaeological Research Center, provided invaluable assistance in the field and labo ratory. We are very indebted to our local workmen, many of whom worked for long hours with great enthusiasm and skill under difficult conditions. Space for equipment, storage, and analysis of excavated ma terials was provided by the Teotihuacan Archaeological Research Cen ter, recently established with the aid of grants from the National Science Foundation, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, and other private and institutional sources. Funds for data analysis have been provided principally by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, with additional assistance from the Ar izona State University Foundation. Saburo Sugiyama, Blas Castellón, and Maa-ling Chen prepared the drawings for this paper, and Virginia Betz aided in preparation of the text. Donald Booth took the photos for Figures 4 and 5, and Figure 13 was taken by Cowgill. All other photos are by Sugiyama. REFERENCES Acosta, Jorge R. 1964 El Palacio de! Quetzalpapalotl.
