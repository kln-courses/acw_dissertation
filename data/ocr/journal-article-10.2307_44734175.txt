Morgan National Highway Traffic Safety Administration U.S. Department of Transportation Washington, D.C. ABSTRACT Since 1976, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has pursued biomechanical research concerning lateral impacts to automotive occupants. These efforts have included (a) the generation of an experimental data base containing both detailed engineering and physiological responses of human surrogates experiencing lateral impacts, (b) the analysis of this data base to develop both an injury index linking the engineering parameters to an injury severity level and response corridors to guide in the design of a test dqmmy, and (c) the development and refinement of a side impact test dummy suitable for use in safety systems development and evaluation. The progress of these efforts has been periodically reported in the literature 11-17 ]* and these references document the evolutionary trail NHTSA has followed over the duration of this research program. The purpose of this paper is to state NHTSA's current understanding of the side impact phenomena by summarizing the currently available biomechanical data, explaining the process by which current injury index and mechanical response corridors were developed, and detailing the current status of NHTSA's Side Impact Dummy (SID). BIOMECHANICAL DATA THE BASIS OF NHTSA'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHENOMENON OF SIDE IMPACT is derived from data obtained from forty-nine detailed experiments utilizing cadaveric specimens. The majority of the tests were conducted at the University of Heidelberg and the Highway Safety Research *Numbers in brackets denote references cited at the end of this paper. Institute. Additional tests performed by ONSER and Wayne State University are also included. Since NHTSA has instituted uniform instrumentation and procedural requirements upon all participants in its biomechanical research efforts, the data from these various institutions are compatible and were easily merged into a single data file. Table 1 summarizes the pertinent facts and parameters associated with this body of data. It is important to note that in all tests contained within this data base, the left side of the specimen was struck by the lateral surface. For this reason, the peak lateral accel- eration of the left fourth thoracic rib, which is the struck side, is reported. As can be seen in Table 1, there are large variations in subject age and mass as well as a variety of test conditions. Considerably more experimental data are available from each test since the majority had full thoracic instrumentation (12 thoracic accelerations and one pulmonary pressure) plus three pelvic and three or nine head accelerations. The later Heidelberg tests also acquired lateral force-time histories associated with the thorax and pelvis interacting with the impacting surface. Summary values for these measurements are also given. All injuries sustained by the test specimens were identi- fied by detailed autopsy and assigned a severity classification using the 1980 Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS 80). [18] Since the subsequent injury index analysis efforts were attempting to relate thoracic response to the resulting injuries, it was decided to include AIS injury evalua- tions for all lesions occurring to anatomical structures on or within the thoracic cage [15]. This concept includes such organs as the liver, kidney, and spleen, which by the AIS definition are abdominal organs. To distinguish this classification from the conventional AIS rating scheme, the acronym 4.359 0096-736X/85/9304-0359$02 . 50 Copyright 1985 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">4*360 R.

Table 1 lists two injury evaluations, AIS1HT and A1S2HT. These represent the level of highest and second highest hard thoracic AIS which were observed. INJURY INDEX DEVELOPMENT An injury index is a mathematical function which relates physical variables describing the conditions of an impact and the body being impacted to a measure describing the severity of the physiological trauma to the body. The analysis process employed by the authors to develop the following injury index cannot be described by any single standardized "cook book" algorithm. It is rather an interpretation of the existing data which has been guided by several underlying assumptions (premises). Therefore, before an explanation of the analysis process and results are presented, the various premises will be stated to allow the reader to make his own judgement as to their validity and also provide the reader the perspective of the authors as the analysis procedure progressed. PREMISES GUIDING INJURY INDEX DEVELOPMENT 1. That the various measured force and/or acceleration time histories are sufficient to describe the mechanical input to the thorax during impact. 2. That injury severity as described by the Abbreviated Injury Scale is a suffi- cient discriminator of the various injury levels. 3. That some form of a monotonically increasing function exists between the intensity of the mechanical input and the severity of the lesions produced as defined by the AIS scale. 4. That injury susceptibility and severity are modulated by both physical size and condition of the test specimen. 3. That better descriptors of injury partition the injury classification levels further apart or with less overlap than do the poorer descriptors. 6. That the quantity of the data avail- able justifies only simple additive or multiplicative combinations of indepen- dent mechanical response and subject descriptive parameters to explain varia- tions within the injury data. 7. If the entire automotive population- at-risk would all experience the identical mechanical input, that the resulting injuries still would be classified in various levels and that each level would have a distinct probability of occurrence. Therefore, any final injury index should reflect this* With the preceding premises taken as the basis of the analysis, investigation of the ability of various individual response variables to explain the injury patterns was made. The first variable evaluated was the measured peak lateral spinal acceleration (T12Y). Figure 1 illustrates its capability by showing the various AIS1HT injury levels within the data set plotted against this variable. Note that an overlap of 90 g's exists between the lowest AIS1HT^4 and the highest AIS1HT=0, that a 40 g overlap exists between the lowest AISHT=4 and highest AIS1HT=3, and that little monotonicity exists between AIS and T12Y. A variety of relationships involving the T12 acceleration and subject mass were then examined to determine which had the greatest overlap reduction potential. Figure 2 illustrates the most successful formulation found. Comparing Figures 1 and 2 shows that the distribution of the various AIS levels with respect to one another does not change when the mass scaling is employed, that is, the monotonicity is not improved. However, the magnitude of overlap between various injury levels has been reduced, i.e., the 0-4 overlap reduced from 90 to 63 g's and the 3-4 overlap reduced from 40 to 34 g's. Crossplotting the mass normalized T12 acceleration with age produced Figure 3. This suggested that a linear combination of age and normalized T12 acceleration could more efficiently separate the high injuries from the low (See dashed line Figure 3). Experimenting with various coefficients (effectively changing slope of line on cross- plot) determined, using the criteria of mini- mization of overlap of injury classifications, that Age + 0.3 ( T12Y * Mass/165 ) was the most efficient discriminator of injury using lateral T12 peak acceleration. Figure 4 illustrates the crossplot of this parameter with AIS1HT. It can be seen that the 0-4 and 3-4 overlaps are now 16 and 34 g's respectively given a constant age and mass. This formulation is also satisfying with respect to many of the premises originally set forth, i.e. , monotonicity of injury severity with respect to the explanatory variable, overlap of the various injury levels is minimized, and a simple functional relationship of acceleration, mass, and age explains injury outcome. The same procedures were used to examine the ability of other response variables (peak left upper rib acceleration (LURY) and peak T1 lateral acceleration) to explain the injury results. Of these, only the left upper rib in the form Age + 1.3 (LURY * M/165) performed as well as T12Y. Figure 5 shows this function plotted against A1S1HT.</page><page sequence="4">4*362 R. H.

AIS 1 HT by (age + 1.3 (Lury * mass/ 165)) Again, the explanatory variable has the same effects upon the data, i.e. , compaction of the data, reduction of overlap between the various injury levels, and establishing a reasonable monotonicity of injury with respect to the explanatory variable. The analysis then explored combining various response parameters by cross plotting the best spinal and rib functions (Figure 6). Again, this suggested a linear combination of these two variables could better separate the high injuries from the low. Experimentation with the slope indicated that 1.4 Age + 0.5 (T12Y + LURY)*Mass/165 would provide the best injury discrimi- nation (Figure 7). Examination of Figure 7 illustrates good data compaction, virtually no overlap existing between AIS 3 and either AIS 4 or 5, only 20 units overlap between the highest 2 and the lowest 4 or 5, and good monotonicity of injury with respect to the independent variables. Further examination of the original data has convinced the authors that this function is the best formulation to use for injury level determination since examples of injury cases could be found where low rib and high spinal accelerations existed (heavy individuals into the APR pad) and vice versa (high rib and low spinal peaks in pendulum tests). This confirmed the fact that infor- mation concerning both rib and spine response enhances understanding of the impact condi- tions, and thus, the ability to predict potential injury hazard. The final step in the analysis procedure was to develop cumulative probability relationships which would indicate the percent of expected injuries greater or equal to AIS1HT 3, 4, or 5 given a value of the independent variable (1.4 Age +0.5 ( T12Y+ LURY) * M/165) which will be called Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI). The TTI was partitioned into 10 unit intervals; and then the number of experiments and the number of experiments greater than or equal to AIS1HT 3, 4, and 5 in each interval were determined along with the average value of the TTI within each interval. These data were then analyzed by the "Probit Procedure" 1 19], which determines the best cumulative normal distribution (by finding the best mean and standard deviation) that has the greatest likelihood of producing all the dose-response (TTI -injury rate) observations seen in each of the 10 unit intervals. This procedure was performed three times, once for each observed dose-response set associated with either the AIS1HT £.3, ¿4, or ^5 level. Figure 8a presents the results.

Injury risk vs. TTI without fairing cumulative frequency functions independently, slight logical inconsistencies exist at the high end of the AIS1HT¿3 and AIS1HT&gt; 4 curves as well as well as at the low end of the AIS1HT* 4 and AIS1HT^5 curves. They are inconsistent because they indicated that there are more injuries at or above the higher injury level than the lower level for a given TTI value. The cumulative probability functions, in Figure 8b, which are the recommended functions relating TTI to the various injury risks, have been adjusted to eliminate these inconsistencies. Examination of the magni- tude of these adjustments indicates that they have remained within the one standard devia- tion confidence bounds of each original curve and do not represent serious distortions of the data. Since the Probit Procedure employed assumes that the response (injury rate) was normal with respect to the independent para- meter and that no evidence existed to take this as a given, other distributions such as log-normal were examined. None were found to improve injury discrimination. Therefore, to maintain simplicity, the original assumption of normality was retained. A few comments on the preceding process are appropriate at this juncture. Each step in the process required some judgement to be exercised in order to proceed to the next step. The authors can only claim that the developed Thoracic Trauma Index and the associated injury risk relationships provide a greatly improved understanding of the relationships among mechanical impact response parameters, the physical characteristics of the subject, and the occurrence and severity of the resulting trauma. No claim is made that these relationships are the optimal* RESPONSE SCALING It is necessary when examining cadaver test results, particularly when these test results are to either define or evaluate the responses required of a test dummy that has its own geometrical and inert ial properties, that some form of scaling be used to normalize cadaver responses to a standard anthropometry. Since each test within Table 1 features a different test subject, every subject had a unique anthropometry determined by its individual geometrical and inertial properties. This variation in subject size affects the responses recorded during a test. For example, if two subjects experience the same change in velocity, but one subject is heavier than another, the heavier subject will experience a greater force.

If these systems are exposed to similar dynamic events, the various responses of the two systems will be similar but possibly in certain ratios to one another. If this geometric scaling between these similar structures can be defined by a single ratio between identical geometric measure- ments, then only two other ratios, those between fundamental units of mass and time, must be established to determine a similarity relationship for any desired parameter. Typically, when dimensional analysis for geometric scaling is performed, the ratio between the fundamental dimensions of mass, time, and length are established. From these fundamental ratios, the ratios of other variables of interest such as velocity, density, modulus of elasticity, etc., can be derived. For the analysis at hand, it was decided, for the convenience of expressing underlying assumptions, to start with three scaling variables, defined by: X Mi = Ms/Mļ XE¿ = Es/Ei Afi = f s/fi where: H = mass P = mass density E = modulus of elasticity X = scaling constant s = subscript for scaled data 1 = subscript for i-th subject It was then assumed that mass density and modulus of elasticity were constant between test subjects, thus X E = 1 Ap = i It can be shown that if these relation- ships and assumptions are true, then the following relationships are also true: Velocity: Vs = Vļ Acceleration: As Ai Length: Ls =Al/3 Time: Ts=Xl/3x. Force: Fs =^2/3 F¿ This scaling algorithm has the advantage that it does not change the velocity of the test, but it does scale all other responses measured in a test; such as, acceleration, force, time, etc. The assumptions of scale models made of identical materials can be</page><page sequence="10">4.368 R. H. EPPINGER, ET AL. shown to be only approximately true since both the geometric scaling and the material constituency assumptions can be shown to be somewhat violated. This does influence the scaling somewhat, but from an overall standpoint this process is considered to be the simplist and most consistent way to scale data. Operationally, the scaling algorithm works in the following manner. 1. Compute X = (165/Mi)l/3 where: 165 lbm is the standard mass Mi 88 mass of test subject "iM 2. Scale the magnitude of the digitized acceleration values by I / X 3. Scale the time interval between data points by X , and then re sample the data at a sampling rate common to all tests. Force time responses are scaled in a similar manner by adjusting the amplitude by ^'2 and time by X • SID BIOF IDELITY For three different sled test conditions, 15 mph rigid wall, 20 mph rigid wall, and 20 mph APR pad, there exists both a SID dummy test and a number of cadaver tests. (Details of the design and construction of the SID can be found in 11], 14], 18], and [19]). Six different tests subjects were run with the 15 mph rigid wall, (15RW); six subjects with the APR pad (20 APR) at 20 miles per hour, and eleven subjects at 20 mph into a rigid wall (20 RW). Using the techniques described above to normalize individual cadaver responses to those of a 165 lbm individual and the techniques described by Morgan, et al. (to develop both response curves for a variety of cadaver measures), cadaver to dummy comparisons were made 111]. The responses studied were the lateral acceleration of the fourth left rib, the lateral acceleration of the twelfth thoracic vertabrae, and the lateral acceleration of the pelvis. More recent tests included wall reaction forces of the thorax and pelvis, and they were also analyzed. The sequence of the analysis was that first all relevant curves were scaled, and then aligned using minimum variance 117]. Then, for each set of signals in each test condition (e.g. , all left rib accelerations in 20 mph APR impacts) , the mean cadaver response (MCR) was computed. At the same time a standard deviation is computed at each sample data point. TVo additional curves are then produced, the plus and minus one standard deviation response. These plus and minus one standard deviation curves then define a response corridor. The degree to which the dummy's response lies within these cadavers corridors describes the dummy's biofidelity. Figures 9-17 show the cadaver corridors (dashed lines) and dummy response (solid line) for the 15 RW, 20 RW, and 20 APR test conditions. The rib, spinal, and pelvic accelerations are shown. Note that the rib of the dummy overřesponds in both the 15 RW and 20 RW tests (Figures 9 and 10) but shows good biofidelity in the 20 APR test (Figure Figure 9. 15 mph rigid wall rib acceleration</page><page sequence="11">DUMMY AND INJURY INDEX 4.369 Figure 10. 20 mph rigid wall rib acceleration 11). In all three test conditions, good biofidelity can be seen at T-12 (Figures 12, 13, and 14). Similarly to the rib, the dummy pelvis overresponds in the 13 and 20 RW tests (Figures 13 and 16) while showing better biofidelity for the pelvis in the 20 APR test (Figure 17). An implication of the rib and pelvis responses is that the dummy is locally too stiff. It should also be noted that the period of the rib and pelvis dummy responses is shorter than the MCR, further implying that the dummy is too stiff. Figures 18-21 show the thoracic and pelvic reaction wall force for the 13 RW, and 20 RW tests. Note that the dummy pelvic and thoracic force response is greater in magnitude and shorter in period when compared to the cadaver Figure 11. 20 mph ARP pad rib acceleration</page><page sequence="12">4 370 R* H* EPPIMGER, ET AL.

Further note the good biofidelity displayed for the 20 APR test (Figures "22 and 23). The impulse (integrated force time curve) is shown for the thorax and pelvis in each of the three test conditions, i.e., 13 RW, 20 RW, and 20 APR in Figures 24-29. Examining the thoracic impulses of the SID and the scaled mean cadaver in these three test conditions suggests that the SID has an effective thoracic mass that averages IS percent higher than the mean cadaver. This is not the case when the pelvic impulses are examined. They indicate that the average effective pelvic mass of the SID exceeds that of the mean cadaver by only 2 percent.

By assuming that the LUR velocity changes from an initial velocity V0 to zero under an acceleration-time history characterized by: X = - A Sin 7T t/T (1) Double integration indicates that under these assumptions the rib would stroke a distance X = V¿/4A (2) over the ground before it would reach zero velocity. Taking the 20 RW test with the SID as a starting point and using V0 = 20 mph and A = 190 g, determines X = 0.11 ft. Restating (2) in the form A =7tv| / 4X (3) estimations of A for all other test velocities were made* It can be seen in Table 2 that this explained the various experimental peak SID LUR accelerations* (See Note below.) It was then determined that if the allowable stroke were increased from 0.11 to 0.18 feet, the predicted LUR peak would be 155 g for the 23 RW condition* Estimating the peak A's at the other test velocities, now showed good correlation between the modified model and the cadaver means. This suggests that adding approximately one inch to the allowable stroke of the SID rib while in contact with the rigid wall would rectify the identified biofidelity problem. Preliminary experimentation with the SID indicates that the addition of a dense one inch thick foam pad in the arm cavity of the exterior skin indeed attenuates the LUR peak acceleration to the desired average values of the cadavers in both the 15 RW and 20 RW test condition* This was achieved without affecting the currently acceptable T12 lateral response. Further testing will be required to determine if this modification is warranted and what the final configuration of this dummy modification would be. INTERPRETATION OF SID/LUR PEAK ACCELERATIONS Several NHTSA research programs have conducted a significant number of vehicle tests using the SID. Since the recent SID biofidelity evaluations have determined that the peak LUR accelerations in rigid wall conditions are higher than the mass scaled cadaver average, it would be inappropriate to use the SID response parameters directly in the Thoracic Trauma Index (TT I). A method was therefore sought that would adjust the LUR of the SID to more closely approximate the cadaver mean response. TVo methods were developed. The first took the two end points of the response 23 RW and 23 APR and developed a linear interpolation function to adjust the peaks, NOTE: Heidelberg tests having 15 or 20 mph test conditions ascribed to them in Table 1 are listed in Table 2 as 18 and 23 mph. These latter values more accurately reflect the actual velocity changes the test surro- gates experienced (determined from both film and analysis and integration of acceleration data) during the test. This increase appears to result from the elastic spring-back caused by the steel bands that decelerate the sled.

EPPINGER, ET AL. i.e., 250 g should be 155 g and 60 g should remain unchanged. Functionally this takes the form, LURe = 30 + 0.5 (LURSID) where LURgiD ~ peak g observed on SID LURe - approximate cadaver equivalent . This function does not consider the time-history that the SID/LUR undergoes* Therefore, a second approach was developed to consider both the amplitude and temporal qualities of the LUR response when adjusting it. This method considers that an appropriate spring-mass-damper system is attached to the LUR of SID (see Figure 30), that, when excited by the SID/LUR measured acceleration, will respond with the accel- eration time history of the cadaver mean response. The equation for this system is Y2 = 2 Wn(Ý1-Ý2) + W£(YI"Y2) where: Yļ = displacement of base ^2 = displacement of mass W« = natural frequency = ^TK/M j = damping ratio = C/24[KM k p----- vw m - n- c L L y} = ACCELERATION y9 ¿ = PREDICTED MEASURED BY ¿ CADAVER DUMMY ACCELERATION Figure 30. Rib acceleration compensation model The task then is to excite this system by setting Yļ to the dummy's measured acceler- ation, and solving the system equation for Y 2* The system's parameters (Wn, J) are then varied so as to match Y2 to the mean cadaver response (MCR). This is done by varying Wn until the period of the response matches the period of the MCR. The damping Of) is then varied to match the magnitude of Y2 to the MCR. Having selected Wn and the^ , the system is specified. Now dummy responses can be transformed by the system equation to equivalent cadaver responses* For the dummy under discussion the system parameters for the transformation are: Wn = 100 sec -1 T = °*95 Figure 31 shows the original dummy response, the MCR, and the transformed dummy response for a 15 mph rigid wall sled test* Figures 32 and 33 show the same for a 20 mph rigid wall test, and a 20 mph APR pad test* The transfer function does an excellent job in very stiff environments such as a rigid wall, but tends to give slightly lower dummy responses compared to the MCR for a padded test. It appears from the data available that the use of the first adjustment technique, the linear interpolation, is appropriate when the half period of the signal being adjusted is less than 15 milliseconds. If the half period exceeds this limit, the latter technique should be used. SID DURABILITY ENHANCEMENTS Over the past five years, the SID has been used in a variety of sled and car crash tests. As the testing progressed to higher and higher severity levels, various design deficiencies were identified and rectified. During the past year, the SID was extensively tested in an elaborate car crash test matrix of varying severity, impact angle, and in vehicles with various structural and padding modifications* While performing the vast number of these tests without any damage, several additional durability problems were identified. The durability problems were three in nature: (1) the rod end bearing connecting the thoracic shock absorber shaft to the rib was bending, (2) the cast knee joints of the dummy had a tendency to break at the femur insertion point, and (3) the leather hinge connecting the ribs to the spine would occasionally develop surface cracks. All three problems were solved by implementing minor modifications* They were (1) replacing the thin rod end bearing with a unit which has more load-bearing surface, (2) placing a hinged device in the femur load cell cavity to relieve loads on the side of the knee, and (3) replacing the leather hinge connecting the ribs to the spine with a 5 ply transmission belt material (synthetic rubber with polyester cords available from a number of manufacturers). The transmission belt material was carefully chosen to produce SID aceleration readings which emulate pendulum and sled runs of the SID with the leather hinge 121]. These improvements make SID a device that can repeatedly undergo vehicle-to-vehicle crash conditions in which the lateral closing velocity approaches 30 mph and not sustain any damage*</page><page sequence="23">DUMMY AMD INJURY INDEX 4.381 Figure 31. Effect of dummy correction function, 15 mph rigid wall test Figure 32. Effect of dummy correction function, 20 mph rigid wall test</page><page sequence="24">4.382 R* H. EPPINGER, ET AL. Figure 33. Effect of dummy correction function, 20 mph APR pad test SID REPEATABILITY The problems associated with quanti- tatively assessing the repeatability and reproducibility* of a test dummy are two- fold: (1) a measure of the similarity between and among the responses of the dummy is required, and (2) a criteria is needed by which the dummy response can be judged acceptably repeatable and reproducible* In the past, the repeatability and reproducibility of test dummies have been assessed by considering their response in terms of some single number measure such as, HIC, SI, chest deflection, or peak accelera- tion 122-25]. The problems associated with assessing repeatability and reproducibility using peak acceleration are well known; i.e. , similar curves with markedly different peaks, and, more commonly, dissimilar curves with the same peak acceleration values. To avoid these problems and assess the entire dummy curve, a new measure of similarity called the Normalized Integral Squared Error (NISE) was used. The NISE was initially developed by Mr. Jovan Jovanovski of the Ford Motor Company 126]. NISE is a quantitative measure of the difference between two time dependent data sets over their duration. *Repeatability is defined as the similarity of results attained from identical tests performed on the same dummy. Reproduc- ibility is defined as the similarity of results obtained from identical tests performed on different dummies. IWo similar acceleration time histories are shown in Figure 34. The difference between these two curves is shaded. Figure 35 is a plot of the difference between the two curves versus time. Since the absolute difference is to be measured, the curve is squared and plotted as shown by the dashed line. The integral of the squared difference versus time curve can be taken to yield the Integral Squared Error which in summation notation, is: N ISE "SI (x2+Yf-2XiYļ) i=l where ISE = Integral Squared Error i = a point in time of the data sets N - the number of points in these data sets x¿ = a point from one data set y£ = a point from the other set In order to eliminate the effect of duration and magnitude of the ISE, the quantity is normalized through division by the maximum possible ISE that can occur for nonnegative cross product terms, X¿Y¿ 0. The Normalized Integral Squared Error is: N ^ (x2+Y2-2XÍYÍ) i=l NISE N (x2+y£) i=l</page><page sequence="25">DUMMY AND INJURY INDEX 4.383 It can be seen that for identical curves, all xļ are equal to all yļ and the numerator is zero, thus NISE equals 0. If one curve is all zeros, for example, all equal 0, then the numerator and denominator will both equalgx^ and NISE equals 1. Figure 31*. Two acceleration time curves Figure 35. Plot of the squared error Should one of the data sets be largely positive and the other largely negative, the cross product could be negative and the NISE would be greater than 1. This would indicate that the data sets are very dissimilar. How- ever, this situation should not occur in a repeatability and reproducibility study. Figure 36 shows two similar curves except for a time shift, • If one curve were to be shifted along the time axis, it can be seen that a minimum difference between the curves would be obtained when the shift equals the time^ť . Therefore, if a NISE for two data sets is calculated for reasonable time shifts, the minimum of these will be the NISE with all difference due to phase shift removed. Figure 3 7 shows two curves that are similar except for a difference in amplitude, A. If the partial derivative of the NISE, with the phase shift already removed, is taken with respect to the difference in amplitude, A, and set equal to zero, a value for A can be calculated that will yield a Figure 36. Two similar curves with a time shift Figure 37. Two curves with an amplitude difference minimum NISE. It must be a minimum since A would equal infinity for a maximum. This minimum NISE is a measure of the difference between the two curves with all phase shift and amplitude difference removed and can be attributed to differences in shape. Thus, the NISE is a measure of the difference between two time dependent data sets and can be divided into NISE (PHASE) due to difference in phase shift, NISE (AMP) due to difference in amplitude, and NISE (SHAPE) due to differences in shape. Using the NISE as a measurement of the difference between two data sets, a criteria can be set for the NISE by which the dummy response can be judged to be acceptably repeatable and reproducible. In the past, it has been generally accepted that a coefficient of variation of .06 on the peak acceleration for a set of dummy acceleration responses is acceptably repeatable. A coefficient of variation of .08 is considered acceptable reproducibility for a set of dunmies. The coefficient of variation is defined as the standard deviation over the mean. This means that there is a 68 percent probability that the difference between any single peak accel- eration and the mean peak acceleration will be less than the standard deviation. It seems reasonable to expect a dummy to meet a</page><page sequence="26">4.384 R. H. EPPINGER, ET AL. more stringent requirement if the entire acceleration time history is considered rather than only a peak value. A reasonable measure of repeatability might be that the area under any single time history should be within 6 percent of the area under the mean curve. Although the deviation at some point may be greater than 6 percent, this would be compensated for at other points such that over the duration of the event the total difference in area is less than 6 percent. This approach would assume that every time history would be at least as much like the mean curve as would a plus or minus one standard deviation curve, whose coefficient of variation is .06 at every point. A problem develops when this criteria is applied using the NISE. Because the NISE involves squared differences, it is a shape dependent measure. Small phase differences can result in a very large NISE, whereas much large amplitude differences can result in a relatively small NISE. A solution is to calculate an allowable NISE (PHASE), NISE (AMP), and NISE (SHAPE). Figure 38 shows the allowable NISE calculated for simple rectan- gular curves undergoing a phase shift only, an amplitude difference only, and a shape difference only, with both 6 percent and 8 percent differences in the area under the curve.

Allowable NISE This results in three criteria that must be met by each time history when compared to a mean curve. It should be noted that because the NISE is based on squared differences, large excursions from the mean contribute heavily to the summation while small excursions contribute far less to the summation. This makes the NISE criteria critical of a few large differences and tolerant of many small differences. Pendulum Test Matrix - Six SID's were used for repeatability and reproducibility testing 1 26]. Three were from one manufacturer and three from another. All six dummies were disassembled and thoroughly inspected to insure they were properly constructed per the drawing package. The test setup was designed to be simple to perform and to use the apparatus developed for existing Part 572 dummy frontal impact tests L 2 ] • The pendulum tests do not require disassembly of the SID. The regions of the SID that are impacted with the pendulum are three: (1) the side of the head through the head center of gravity, (2) the side of the thorax where the middle rib and the center line of the rib bar intersect, and (3) the side of the hip through the H-point of the thigh-pelvis structure. Each of the three body parts were impacted by the pendulum at different impact velocities: (1) head - 7 feet per second, (2) thorax - 14 and 20 fps, and (3) pelvis - 14 fps. The head was impacted at 90° (left side of dummy's head). The thorax was impacted at 75°, 90°, and 105°. The pelvis was impacted at 90°. The SID head was repeatable. The mean curve for the head impact is in Figure 39. The SID pelvis was repeatable. The mean curve for the pelvis impact is shown in Figure 40. Turning now to the thoracic pendulum impact, the results of the initial testing were presented in Reference 25 in October 198 3. That paper concluded the SID was repeatable but not reproducible. Subsequent effort was expended in a search for the source (or sources) of the variability in different SID's. During this search, the black shrink tubing on the ribs was removed to reveal cracking of the rib damping material. The damping material was removed from all the ribs. The SID was then retested 250 1- SID HEAD Y ACCELERATION 200 - 150- A w " y 00- / 50 - / ' 0 - -50 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 I i I i I &lt; I ■ I -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 1214 16 TIME CMILLISECS) Figure 39.

Pendulum pelvis impact (14 fps, 90 degrees, 180 Hz filter) without the damping material and found to be both re peat ab le and reproducible [23]. The damping material on the ribs is a major source of the SID's reproducibility problems. To insure compliance of the SID's thorax, the recommended procedure is to impact it perpendicularly at 14 fps with the pendulum. The left upper rib signal is compared with the recommended curve in Figure 41. The two curves may be shifted in time relative to each other to minimize phase differences* (The method described in Reference 11 is one systematic way to minimize phase differences* ) The NISE value for the two curves should then satisfy the allowable value in Figure 38 for both the amplitude difference at the 8 percent level and the shape difference at the 8 percent level. If the SID fails the 8 percent level, it is likely the ribs are the source of variation. After examination of the ribs, the SID should be retested until it satisfies both the amplitude and shape difference NISE values at the 8 percent level. 80 p SID UPPER LEFT RIB Y ACCELERATION 60 - 40 - r' co ' Ò20f- ' ' 0- ^ ļ y -20- -40 1 i I i I .

Pendulum chest impact (20 fps, 90 degrees, 180 Hz filter) CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Considerable effort has been invested by NHTSA to develop a methodology to evaluate the human thoracic and abdominal injury hazard of side impacts. The proposed methodology requires the use of a tuned mechanical surrogate of man to be placed in the crash situation to be evaluated, measure- ments made of the dynamic response of this device during the crash, and an analysis performed of these responses to determine the expected human injury hazard. A series of forty-nine detailed side-impact cadaver tests have been conducted to provide the biome- chanical basis for the development of this methodology. Intensive analysis of the NHTSA Biomechanical data indicates that injuries to the thoracic cage and the organs within it are strongly related to the peak lateral acceleration experienced by the struck side rib cage and the lower thoracic spine. Subject age and mass also have an influence on the susceptibility to and severity of the injury. A relationship called the Thoracic Trauma Index (TT I) has been developed that has the ability to discriminate the various injury levels as defined by the Abbreviated Injury Scale. It takes the following form: TT I = 1.4 Age + 0.3 (T12Y + LU RY)* MAS S /16 3 Cumulative probability functions defining the probable occurrence of injuries either greater than or equal to an AIS1HT of 3, 4, or 3 have been defined as a function of the TTI. These functions can be used to give good estimates of the expected number of each level of injury given measured impact</page><page sequence="28">4.386 R. H. EPPINGER, ET AL. responses and the age and weight distributions of a population-at-risk. The side impact d$ta base has also allowed development of thoracic performance require- ments for human surrogates for a variety of impact conditions* A test dummy has been developed by NHTSA, called the SID (side impact dummy). Extensive testing with the SID in actual testing programs has allowed the design to evolve to the point that it can now be repeatedly exposed to vehicle crash conditions that produce extremely serious injuries without any detrimental effects. Documentation of the design and performance requirements are complete and the device is commercially available. Comparisons between cadaver derived per- formance criteria and the response of the SID document good agreement between the thoracic spine area. However, the SID produces higher rib responses in tests with rigid walls. An analytical process has been proposed that adjusts this response to the expected cadaver response and allows use of the TTI to evaluate injury risk using the current SID design. In conclusion, the authors feel that NHTSA1 s side impact injury assessing method- ology has been developed to the point that it can be used to make realistic improvements in the lateral impact safety of vehicles.
