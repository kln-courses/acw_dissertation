         <p>They burned the temple of the Cuitlahuaca, which was a house of the devil Mixcoatl. And on this occasion Yaocuixtli of Mexicatzinco was the first to rush to the top of the Mixcoatl, seizing the ashes of Itzpapalotl—what was called the bundle, etc. [The ashes] were contained in two [lengths of] quetzal bamboo. Then Tenochtitlan’s Citlalcoatzin and Iquehuatzin and Axicyotzin and Tenamaztzin spoke to Texoxomoctli: “O Texoxomoctzin,” they said, “Mixcoatl the younger was burned, for you failed to pick up your shield and arrows. Now, there’s this: Where did you put Mixcoatl? We must take him away. Give him to us.”<sup>1</sup>

      <p>During the reign of Moteuczoma Ilhuicamina (ca. 1398–1469), the Mexica (Aztec) waged war on the Cuitlahuaca under the auspice of returning a third group, the Atenchicalque, to their homeland. During the battle, Yaocuixtli of Mexicatzinco ran into the burning temple of the deity Mixcoatl to rescue the goddess Itzpapalotl’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> (sacred bundles; literally “something wrapped or bundled”). As the temple burned, Moteuczoma’s representatives initiated an exchange with Texoxomoctzin in which they demanded that the ruler hand over the <italic>teixiptla</italic> (localized embodiment) of Mixcoatl. Texoxomoctzin directed his reply toward the story’s audience as much as the Mexica standing before him. He explained that relinquishing the god would compromise his people’s future. Unwilling to take such a risk, he tricked the Mexica. Instead of giving them Mixcoatl, he handed over another <italic>teixiptla</italic>, that of Teuhcatl: “It was not really the image of the so-called Camaxtle Mixcoatl. It was just the one named Teohcatl [<italic>sic</italic>]. It had the same costume as Mixcoatl, and this is what the Mexica took it for, thinking it was he. Thus the Mexica were deceived.”<sup>2</sup> Narrative digressions like this one punctuate the <italic>Anales de Cuauhtitlan</italic>, which chronicles the reigns of Tenochtitlan’s rulers, and Texoxomoctin’s clever ruse is clearly the point of this elaboration. The text draws us into the thrill of the battle and the capture of Mixcoatl, and it would be easy for us to overlook an earlier event in the story: rescue of Itzpapalotl’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> from Mixcoatl’s temple. Yet the rescue’s prominent place in the narrative and the details surrounding it—the name of the bundle’s owner, the identity of its rescuer, the materials of its construction and their quantity—call our attention to the importance of <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> in Aztec religion.<sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <p>In his <italic>Historia eclesiástica indiana</italic> written in the late sixteenth century and published nearly two centuries later, Gerónimo de Mendieta cites an observation about <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> made by his Franciscan colleague Andrés de Olmos. The <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> was, Olmos explained, the “principal ídolo que tenían en mucha reverencia, y no tenían en tanta como a este a los bestiones o figuras de piedra o de palo que ellos hacían” (main idol, greatly revered [by them], so that they did not esteem as much as this one those large beasts or stone figures that they manufactured).<sup>4</sup> The centrality of <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> in Mexica religion—and in indigenous American religions more generally—would be difficult to overstate. Curiously, though perhaps not surprisingly, their significance seems inversely proportionate to the amount we know about them. As sacred bundle expert Guilhem Olivier has noted, “their study is difficult, partly because of the secret character of the rituals devoted to them [and partly because of] the discretion of indigenous informants.”<sup>5</sup> Observations like this make even the briefest mention of a <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>—like the one in the <italic>Anales</italic>—all the more significant. The rescue of Itzpapalotl’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> from Mixcoatl’s temple raises questions we will pursue in the following pages: What were <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>? What do we know about their origins? From what were they made? To whom did they belong? What purposes did they serve? And, ultimately, how did they relate to <italic>teteo</italic> (deities) and their <italic>teixiptlahuan</italic> (localized embodiments)?</p>
      <p>
         <italic>Teixiptla</italic>, which forms through a compound of <italic>ixtli</italic> (eye; face; surface) and <italic>xip</italic> (shaving; peeling; flaying), signifies “a surface-flayed thing.” A person became a god’s localized embodiment through a ritual production that involved wearing the deity’s skin and/or clothing.<sup>6</sup> We shall see that <italic>teixiptlahuan</italic> and <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> share several features but that significant elements distinguish the two modes of god-body.</p>
      <p>According to the accounts we will examine, each <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> enveloped the precious relics of an entity who had been instrumental in primordial progenitive events and actions, such as the first dawn.<sup>7</sup> It bound together the physical remains and <italic>axcaitl</italic> (property, possessions) of the <italic>teteo</italic> whose self-sacrifice animated the world. The bundles were themselves active agents in the mythohistory of Mexica and Mixtec migrations from their places of origins through settlements and foundation. In fact, migration accounts—both pictorial and alphabetic—provide some of the richest sources for information about <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>. In addition to the mythohistorical records of bundles’ origins and their roles in migration and settlement, we find <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> in the texts and images of several codices and post-Contact chronicles, including Bernardino de Sahagún’s <italic>Primeros Memoriales</italic> and <italic>Florentine Codex</italic>, Gerónimo de Mendieta’s <italic>Historia</italic>, Fernando Chimalpahin’s <italic>Codex Chimalpopoca</italic>, Alvarado Tezozomoc’s <italic>Crónica mexicana</italic>, the anonymous <italic>Historia de los Mexicanos por sus pinturas</italic>, and the Codex Boturini (see fig. 1).<sup>8</sup>

      <p>While the word “<italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>” in its sense as “sacred bundle” occurs only once in Sahagún’s <italic>Florentine Codex</italic>—“niman ic yaque, in teomamaque, in quimilli, in tlaquimilolli quitqui” (thereupon the god-carriers departed; they carried him wrapped in a bundle, in a sacred bundle)<sup>9</sup>—<italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> appear several times in the text’s illustrations. What we can discern about <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> derives from their representations in codices, their descriptions in mythohistories, chroniclers’ accounts of their significance, and the difficulty extirpators encountered in attempts to uncover them. Records from the Inquisition in New Spain document the lengths to which officials went in search of <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>—especially those they suspected to have been concealed within Tenochtitlan’s Templo Mayor—often to no avail.<sup>10</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Olivier’s work documents the visual and textual evidence of <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, their origin narratives, and the roles they played in state society, including rites of accession and new fire ceremonies.<sup>11</sup> His research acts as a springboard for our consideration of how <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> related to <italic>teotl</italic> (deity) and <italic>teixiptla</italic>, conceptually, materially, and practically. Indeed, comparing and contrasting <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> with both <italic>teotl</italic> and <italic>teixiptla</italic> provide us with a method through which we may further distinguish the three concepts, particularly as the specific qualities of <italic>teotl</italic> come to bear on the origins and manufacture of <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>.<sup>12</sup> That is to say, we will bring into focus how <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> and <italic>teixiptlahuan</italic> presented or manifested <italic>teteo</italic> by considering the similarities, differences, and overlapping qualities of the two forms of deity embodiment as they relate to the Mexica concept of <italic>teotl</italic>.</p>
      <p>A series of comparative and exploratory exercises aids us in refining our interpretations of <italic>teteo, teixiptlahuan</italic>, and <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>. Examining the semantic range of <italic>quimilli</italic> (bundle) defines the relationship of sacred bundles to other types of bundles.<sup>13</sup> Mythohistorical and historical descriptions of <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>’s origins and functions give us a sense of how the Mexica conceived of, produced, and interacted with these special bundles. Tradition tells us that the posthumous remains of deities—whether ashes, bones, or clothing—provided the materials from which devotees fashioned <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, and mythohistories recount their lives during migrations from caves of origin into the Central Valley. <italic>Teteo</italic> directed their migrating devotees by speaking to <italic>teomamaque</italic> (god-carriers) through <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> and to priests in dreams. Devotees regarded a <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> as their <italic>teotl</italic>’s material manifestation, and the precious bundle’s presence in the community motivated migrants to build protective temples—like the one in which we encountered Itzpapalotl’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>—immediately upon settling. Historically, <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> occupied significant and signifying roles in state ceremonies, including the training of human <italic>teixiptlahuan</italic>, the accessions of rulers, and new fire ceremonies. An overview of the functions of <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> in Mexica religion and state ceremony prompts us to consider how the bundles’ materiality contributed to their role in the religious community.</p>
      <p>Covering and contents comprised the essential elements of <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>. Fabric, clothes, or animal hides formed the bundles’ outermost layers, and these wrappings physically expressed the root of the concept <italic>quimiloa</italic> (to wrap someone or something in a blanket; to enshroud), nominalized as <italic>quimilli</italic> (bundle of clothes, blankets).<sup>14</sup> In addition to the bundles’ coverings, their contents, which variously included biological remains, flints, mirrors, and precious stones, also figured into the regard in which devotees held the objects/entities. Given skin’s prominence in the construction of <italic>teixiptlahuan</italic>, the role exuviae played in the formation of <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>—from cloth exteriors to ash, bone, and <italic>chalchihuitl</italic> “heart” interiors—is striking. In a very real sense, the composite materials of <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> both constituted the <italic>teotl</italic>’s body and made it recognizable. Regardless of the fact that <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> were neither anthropomorphic nor zoomorphic, devotees identified the <italic>teteo</italic> they embodied by virtue of the bundles’ (re)collection of a given god’s constitutive qualities. That both <italic>teixiptlahuan</italic> and <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> made <italic>teteo</italic> present in the lives of devotees raises questions about the distinctions between the two forms of deity manifestation and the specific purposes each served. We will return to these themes in closing.</p>

         <title>Unwrapping the Meaning of <italic>Tlaquimilolli</italic>
         </title>
         <p>The noun <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> denotes a specific type of bundle, often glossed as a “sacred bundle,” and has a rich and revealing etymology. Four components form this compound: <italic>tla</italic>-, a nonpersonal indefinite object prefix; the verbal root <italic>quimiloa</italic> (to wrap someone or something in a blanket; to enshroud); -<italic>l</italic>, a patentive suffix; and -<italic>li</italic>, the absolutive ending for a nonpossessed singular noun.<sup>15</sup> 
            <italic>Quimiloa</italic>, the verb at the root of <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, formed around the noun <italic>quimilli</italic> (bundle). <italic>Quimilli</italic> became the intransitive verb <italic>quimilihui</italic> (to become a bundle), by acquiring the inceptive verber -<italic>ihui</italic> and then became transitive with the addition of the causative suffix -<italic>oa</italic>. The resulting verb <italic>quimiloa</italic> means “to make something into a bundle; to bundle something up.” A <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, then, is “a bundle; something that has been bundled up.”<sup>16</sup> In contrast to <italic>quimilli</italic>, defined by Frances Karttunen as “bundle of clothes, blankets,” a <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> signifies a more specific type of bundle, one that someone made.<sup>17</sup> As a patentive or deverbal noun, <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> indicates “not the action of the verb, but the result of the action, that which has been acted upon.”<sup>18</sup> Thus, <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> refers to the completed bundle, the object that results from someone’s bundling activity. As we shall see, the wrappings of <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> bound together the personal property and material remains of <italic>teteo</italic>. A brief survey of the greater semantic context of <italic>quimiloa</italic> and <italic>quimilli</italic> provides us with a better sense of the terms’ range and of (<italic>tla</italic>)<italic>quimilolli</italic>’s specificity.</p>
         <p>Definitions and contextual uses of <italic>quimilli</italic> and <italic>quimiloa</italic> in post-Contact sources provide information about the words’ various meanings and semantic ranges. According to the <italic>Nahuatl Dictionary, quimilli</italic> functions as “a counter (equivalent to 20)” and also denotes “a bundle.”<sup>19</sup> In <italic>L’imaginaire des nombres chez les anciens Mexicains</italic>, Danièle Dehouve explains that <italic>quimilli</italic> belonged to a group of digital quantifiers that classified groups of twenty objects or entities according to their forms or shapes.<sup>20</sup> 
            <italic>Quimilli</italic>, she explains, “designates ‘twenty pieces of fabric.’ This term was reserved for pieces of fabric enclosed in a <italic>quimilli</italic>, that is to say in a bound package (from <italic>quimiloa</italic>, ‘to wrap up’). In the expression <italic>on-quimilli in cuachtli</italic>, ‘forty capes,’ literally ‘two times a pack of twenty capes,’ it must be understood that capes were tied in bundles and not, as in the case of <italic>ipilli</italic> [a quantifier of flat objects], placed one over the other in layers.”<sup>21</sup> We might liken <italic>quimilli</italic>, then, to words that count or quantify a specific amount of a particular object, as do the English words “ream” (500 sheets of paper), “bushel” (sixty-four US pints or eight imperial gallons), and “peck” (an amount of dry goods equal to a quarter of a bushel).<sup>22</sup> Contextual uses of <italic>quimilli</italic> in the <italic>General History</italic> demonstrate its use as a digital quantifier and provide a sense of its range of connotations.</p>
         <p>Groups of cloths, most particularly of capes, are described as “bundles”: “But the capes came in bundles. They were only in bales. Only by the bundle were they given and presented.”<sup>23</sup> In the vigesimal counting system, <italic>cem</italic> (one) complete count includes twenty of a given thing. Thus, in the phrase “<italic>cenquimilli in tecuachtli</italic>” (one bundle of capes), <italic>quimilli</italic> signifies a complete count of twenty capes. In a marketplace exchange, a merchant trades “<italic>cenquimilli</italic>,” one bundle (i.e., twenty) capes for tomatoes: “And he arranged to buy tomatoes; daily he bought tomatoes with perhaps twenty small capes.”<sup>24</sup> In a discussion of merchants acquiring slaves for the celebration of Panquetzaliztli, the <italic>General History</italic> explains that a buyer who selected a skilled dancer might pay “<italic>cenquimilli onmactlactli</italic>” (one-bundle ten) or thirty large capes. In the marketplace, bundles of capes of varying quality carried different economic values in trade: “The value of a boat [of water] was one small cape given [for it]. The value of one small cape was one hundred cacao beans; this was the one [known as] <italic>tototlaqualtequachtli</italic>. And the value of the following small cape was eighty cacao beans. And finally the value of the last small cape was sixty-five cacao beans.”<sup>25</sup> The monetary value of cape bundles depended on their size and craftsmanship, but the <italic>quimilli</italic>, or bundle, seems to have been a standard unit of measure for capes in mercantile exchanges. With regard to capes, <italic>quimilli</italic> indicates a count (of twenty) rather than signifying a random number of cloths. By contrast with “ream,” “peck,” or “bushel” and even to other Nahuatl quantifiers, <italic>quimilli</italic> connotes the sense of completion, wholeness, and totality accorded twenty in the vigesimal system.</p>
         <p>The semantic range of <italic>quimilli</italic> as “bundle” widens to signify wrappings that bind and expands <italic>quimilli</italic>’s sense of completion and complete sets. Some of the most common extensions of <italic>quimilli</italic> from bundles to bindings include paper wrappings used in ceremonies, bandages or wrappings used for medicinal purposes, wrappings that veil an individual’s head or face, and wrappings that enshroud corpses. In both Ochpaniztli and Tititl, festivals dedicated to the goddesses Teteoinnan and Ilama Tecuhtli, respectively, paper bound together ritual structures. In Tititl, ritual officiants built and then burned a model of the goddess’s “grain bin,” which they joined together with paper: “They wrapped paper about it; they caulked it with paper.”<sup>26</sup> During Ochpaniztli, <italic>cihuatlamacazque</italic> (offering priestesses) carried on their backs seven ears of dried maize covered in liquid rubber and bound with paper: “They carried the dried maize on their backs.…They wrapped them each in paper, and they carried them with precious capes.”<sup>27</sup> In her study of Ochpaniztli, Catherine R. DiCesare argues that the dates associated with this ritual’s depiction in the <italic>Codex Borbonicus</italic> and the <italic>Leyenda de Los Soles'</italic>s description of Quetzalcoatl’s activities at the Mountain of Sustenance suggest that the priestesses’ ritual use of maize recalled the <italic>teotl</italic>’s primordial collection of food for humans.<sup>28</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In the <italic>Leyenda de los Soles</italic>, Quetzalcoatl sets out in search of sustenance for human beings, and he transforms into a black ant in order to follow a red ant who knows where the maize is stored. Quetzalcoatl quickly confronts a problem: he can carry only a small amount of maize, not nearly enough to sustain humanity. And so, Cipactonal and Oxomoco summon thunder and the <italic>tlatoque</italic>, “blue <italic>tlatoque</italic>, white <italic>tlatoque</italic>, yellow <italic>tlatoque</italic>, red <italic>tlatoque</italic>,” to complete the task.<sup>29</sup> Thunder strikes the mountain, and the <italic>tlatoque</italic> steal away with the staple foods of the Mesoamerican diet: “The white, black, and yellow corn, the red corn, the beans, the amaranth, the chia, the fish amaranth, all of the foods were stolen.”<sup>30</sup> The seven ears of corn carried by Chicomecoatl’s priestesses during Ochpaniztli likely resonated with this account and also would have signified maize’s divinatory functions, including its use in curative practices.<sup>31</sup> Furthermore, the mention of precious capes in proximity to the bound ears of corn suggests that the priestesses may have carried the maize in a manner similar to that of a god-carrier bearing a <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>. In both Ochpaniztli and Tititl, paper bindings create a “bundle” of ritual objects that—taken together—comprise a whole, either through complete representation, as with the maize, or through a completed structure, in the case of the grain bin.</p>
         <p>Elsewhere in the <italic>General History</italic>, bandages bind wounds and broken bones. <italic>Earthly Things</italic> describes the Chiahuaitl or Chiauhcoatl, a large venomous snake, as “a terrifying one, a poisonous one; one that strikes one, spies on one, watches one on the road.”<sup>32</sup> The bite of a Chiauhcoatl often led to the loss of a limb or to death, but there was a cure: “And the cure for the snakebite is to suck it at once. And many lines are slashed on the surface of the snakebite where it has proceeded to swell. And where he has been bitten is spread over, wrapped with a thin maguey fiber cloth. [Then] it is stretched over live coals and rubbed with fine tobacco.”<sup>33</sup> In the case of wounds, such as the Chiauhcoatl’s bite or broken bones, binding facilitated healing rather than a collection or count. Broken legs, for example, were treated with a compound of two roots, covered—literally “bound”—in cloth bandages, tied to splints, and left to heal for twenty days.<sup>34</sup> (Note the length of the cure, one complete count of twenty days.) The binding, bundling nature of <italic>quimilli</italic> restores a flesh wound or broken bone to wholeness. In these contexts—paper’s use in ceremonies or bandages’ use in cures—the <italic>quimilli</italic> (re)constructs a whole, be it a whole structure or a whole body.</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Quimilli</italic>’s binding action transformed materials by (re)joining parts into a whole, and <italic>quimilli</italic> also tied intangible qualities to the observable world through ritual. Historically, binding facilitated powerful transformations in rituals like the accession of a new <italic>tlahtoani</italic> (speaker; trad. ruler). <italic>Book 8: Kings and Lords</italic> describes rites of accession upon the occasion of a new ruler’s selection, a process that involved the transformation of a <italic>tlazopipil</italic> (prince; literally “precious noble”) into a <italic>tlahtoani</italic>. The lords gathered to choose one of the <italic>tlazopipiltin</italic> from among the sons of the noble lords, and guided by a list of characteristics desirable in a <italic>tlahtoani</italic>, they selected someone “experienced in war, who shrank not from the enemy, who knew not wine.”<sup>35</sup> Once an appropriate candidate had been chosen, he and his four lords initiated ritual preparations for the transfer of power. The text emphasizes the five candidates’ attire and ritual paraphernalia, both of which were decorated with a bone motif. The <italic>teopixque</italic> (god caretakers; priests) dressed the <italic>tlahtoani</italic>-elect first: “Then they veiled his face, they covered his head [with a] green fasting cape designed with bones.”<sup>36</sup> Then they dressed the four lords: “Then they veiled and covered their faces, each one of them, with black fasting capes designed with bones.”<sup>37</sup> The <italic>tlahtoani</italic> wore the <italic>xicolli xoxouhqui</italic> (green sleeveless jacket) and <italic>nezahualcuachtli xoxoctic omicallo</italic> (green fasting cape with bones), and his lords donned the same attire in black. Over the course of several days—including a four-day period of penitence during which the five candidates entered Huitzilopochtli’s temple at midnight to make offerings of incense and blood—the candidates’ ritual transformation took them from nobility to positions in which they became much more responsible to and for the <italic>teteo</italic>.</p>
         <p>In the context of the <italic>tlahtoani</italic>’s accession, the veiling of the green and black fasting capes concealed the candidates as they underwent a process of transformation from one state (of being, social location, and responsibility) to another. Following Richard Townsend, Cecelia Klein suggests that in wearing the <italic>xicolli</italic>, the <italic>tlahtoani</italic>-elect and his staff ritually returned to the primordium.<sup>38</sup> Klein argues that the leaders’ return to the beginning facilitated their transformation through “healing” contact with a time when Huitzilopochtli lived in skeletal form, a form represented in the <italic>xicolli</italic>’s skull and crossbones motif. According to Klein’s analysis, the garments’ designs wrapped the officials in Huitzilopochtli’s osseous origins and healing capabilities. Patricia Anawalt’s analysis of the <italic>xicolli</italic> as a memory cloth compliments Klein’s reading of the ceremonial garments. Anawalt argues that the <italic>xicolli, quemitl</italic> and <italic>quechquemitl</italic>, all special-use garments associated with human sacrifice, “retain[ed] information regarding their pasts [and] such clothing truly can be said to hold memory.”<sup>39</sup> Based on <italic>quimilli</italic>’s meaning, we also know that the binding action of the garments worn by the officials facilitated change in their state and status. Indeed, the ritual of accession bound the <italic>tlahtoani</italic> to his new station and resulted in the presentation of five complete(ly) new rulers, an authoritative quincunx.</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Quimilli</italic> occurs in more mundane ritual contexts as well, including those of mortuary preparations. Ximena Chávez Balderas explains that two variables affected funerary treatments: “the cause of death and the social position.”<sup>40</sup> According to Sahagún, “When someone died—when [the sextons] adorned him, they wrapped him in his mantle and bound him [in wrappings].”<sup>41</sup> Other elements of the standard posthumous treatment of bodies in Mexica culture included enshrouding the corpse, adorning it with paper garments, cremating the corpse along with important personal articles, and gathering the ashes in a container.<sup>42</sup> These procedures prepared the person for Mictlan, the land of the dead to which “went all those who died on earth, who died only of sickness: the rulers, the commoners.”<sup>43</sup> For the average person who died of natural causes, postmortem preparations involved “rituals in the presence of the corpse, cremation, collection of the ashes and their deposit, and burial of the human remains,” but special circumstances called for special burial rites.<sup>44</sup> The appendix to <italic>Book 3: The Origin of the Gods</italic> describes such mortuary treatments and their significance in detail.</p>
         <p>At the time of death, family members prayed over the body before summoning a ritual specialist, an <italic>amatlamatqui</italic> (paper designer), who “kept on cutting, they kept on slicing it evenly, they kept on binding the paper. And when they had prepared the paper vestments, thereupon they arrayed the dead one; they sat him up; they poured water on his head.”<sup>45</sup> The specialists ritually bathed the corpse and placed a bowl of water with the body before bundling in preparation for cremation: “They wrapped the dead one well, they wrapped him thoroughly, they bound him thoroughly, they bound him closely.”<sup>46</sup> After wrapping the body, they dressed it in the paper garments cut for this occasion. Then along with the corpse, which they cremated, they burned the deceased’s personal property because they believed the items would be helpful in navigating Mictlan. Upon arriving in Mictlan, Mictlan tecuhtli (Lord of the Land of the Dead) returned to the person the items that had been burned along with the individual’s corpse. Men received back their weaponry, insignia, and captives’ property and clothing, and women received their sewing paraphernalia and garments. The dead used these items for their protection from the extreme elements of Mictlan, like the obsidian blade winds they encountered: “It was said that they would make themselves an enclosure [with these things]; thus they would crouch protected from the obsidian-bladed winds; not much would they suffer.”<sup>47</sup>
         </p>
         <p>A passage from <italic>Book 4: The Soothsaysers</italic> describing the fates of persons born on <italic>ce xochitl</italic> (One Flower) underscores the importance of wrapping the corpse prior to its cremation. The Mexica thought of this day-sign as “a little miserable, and a little good,” and the trouble with being born on <italic>ce xochitl</italic> had to do with how one handled success.<sup>48</sup> Those who paid too much attention to their success and wealth became proud and lost favor with <italic>ipalnemohuani</italic> (He by whom we live). Of the proud, “He by whom we live, who had endowed him, took from and deprived him of his deserts.”<sup>49</sup> When such an individual became so ill as to long for death, no one paid any attention to his suffering, because he had been so prideful. And so “when he died, he only aroused pity. Nothing was laid over him; he was only cast out naked; there was nothing at hand to be used as wrappings for the dead.”<sup>50</sup> In contrast to individuals whose families bundled them prior to burial and who ensured their (relative) comfort in the afterlife by sending along their possessions to Mictlan tecuhtli, those whose corpses were left uncovered would find only misery in the afterlife. In this discussion of mortuary treatments, we should not overlook the fact that the Mexica collected crematory remains and placed them in urns. Most people interred family urns in a special location within their house complex, and archaeologists have identified some interments recovered from Templo Mayor caches as those of <italic>tlahtoque</italic>.</p>
         <p>In special cases, the posthumous treatment of Mexica corpses followed other ritual procedures, some of which involved elaborate rebuilding and bundling. For example, when a body could not be recovered from the battlefield, they made a bundle to represent the fallen individual, because “in whichever case, a warrior—whether in flesh and bone or fashioned from pine—had to be placed into the crematory fire.”<sup>51</sup> Durán describes the funerary bundles fashioned for Mexica warriors who died in Michoacan: <disp-quote>
               <p>On the fifth day, images of the dead were made from slivers of resinous wood, each one with feet, arms, and head. Faces were made on these, the eyes and the mouth. They were dressed with breechcloths, sashes, and mantles. To their shoulders were attached wings of hawk feathers, as it was believed that in this way they would fly before the sun every day. The heads of these images were feathered and pendants for the ears, nose and lips were placed upon them. The statues were taken to a room called Tlacochcalco. The widows then entered and each one placed in front of the statue of her husband a dish of a stew called <italic>tlacatlacualli</italic>, which means “food of human flesh.” Together with these were offered some special tortillas called <italic>papalotlaxcalli</italic>, “butterfly bread,” and a drink made of a little flour of toasted maize dissolved in water.…At dusk, when this ceremony was over, the widows rewarded the singers with ordinary mantles, breechcloths, and digging sticks. Then the elders ordered that all the statues be placed together and set on fire. Since they were made of resinous firewood and covered with paper, they burned with great fury. All the widows stood around the fire, weeping with great sorrow.<sup>52</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>When bodies could not be cremated, the Mexica made and dressed images of the dead as proxies for cremation. Presumably, these “corpses,” which Chávez Balderas refers to as <italic>bultos</italic> (bundles), were bundled in a manner similar to that described above. Most forms of death required cremation, and so it is curious that while the Mexica bound human corpses prior to their cremation, they bound <italic>teotl</italic> bodies in sacred bundles subsequent to their cremation. The Mexica bundled, cremated, and memorialized their deceased for ritually proscribed periods of time, but they reconstituted their <italic>teteo</italic> in <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, a process with significantly different results than the interment of remains in homes and temples.</p>
         <p>Our brief survey of the semantic range of <italic>quimilli</italic> indicates that the term signified a complete count of twenty, especially with regard to <italic>quimilli</italic> of capes, and that its meaning extended to encompass other bundles or bindings that facilitated completion or wholeness through transformation. In its extended sense, <italic>quimilli</italic> encompassed paper bindings that completed ritual constructions and bandages whose bindings healed wounds and broken bones. Veils that covered the faces of the <italic>tlahtoani</italic>-elect and his lords facilitated their transformations into rulers and redefined their relationships with <italic>teteo</italic>. Finally, <italic>quimilli</italic> played an important role in securing a less arduous afterlife for those bound to Mictlan and was thus crucial in the transition from life to death. By contrast to <italic>quimilli, tlaquimilolli</italic> signifies the bundle manufactured as part of the mortuary treatment of a cremated god-body, rather than a human body. Mythohistorical accounts of <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>’s origins, composition, and functions bear out these connections to fire, beginnings, endings, and new beginnings.</p>

         <title>Sacred Bundle Biographies</title>
         <p>According to Mexica mythohistory, <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> originated in progenitive, regenerative, and transformative events during the primordium that extended from before the birth of the sun until the foundation of Tenochtitlan. Surviving accounts of the creation of <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> illustrate their production in the immediate aftermath of divine death and destruction: Mendieta describes the creation of several <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> following the sacrifice of gods whose deaths caused the sun to move across the sky; the <italic>Leyenda de los Soles</italic> and the <italic>Anales de Cuauhtitlan</italic> describe Itzpapalotl’s death and the creation of her <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>; Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxóchitl provides an account of Quetzalcoatl’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>; both Bartolomé de las Casas and Juan Baptista de Pomar mention Tezcatlipoca’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>; and the <italic>Historia de los Mexicanos por sus pinturas</italic>, the <italic>Cronica Mexicayotl</italic>, and Cristobal del Castillo’s <italic>Historia</italic> account for the origin of Huitzilopochtli’s <italic>tlaquimilolli.</italic> Although our sources may occlude more than they reveal about sacred bundles, by drawing on them we are able to sketch a composite image of <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>—however tentative it may be—that underscores the deep significance of death’s regenerative and progenitive effects in Mexica religion. From the death of the gods—deaths often brought by their own hands—emerged <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, sacred bundles that enveloped the ashes and effects of those very deities. <italic>Tlaquimilolli</italic> (re)embodied <italic>teteo</italic>, and in so doing, they became a devotional focus and a source of counsel for the community. Prior to being born(e) by a <italic>teomama</italic> (<italic>teotl</italic>-carrier), the <italic>teotl</italic> first had to die, and through death, the god (re)emerged as a <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, unspeakably precious. The following mythohistorical accounts tell rich, enigmatic, and occasionally overlapping stories about the circumstances in which <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> originated, and they greatly amplify our ability to understand the bundles’ functions and significances.</p>
         <p>Mendieta’s account of the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> created after the gods’ sacrifice at Teotihuacan appears in his <italic>Historia eclesiástica indiana</italic> (1596) and reads like the story of the originary <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>. Having created the world and humans, the gods found themselves without a sun, and so they gathered at Teotihuacan, where they built an enormous fire and stationed themselves around each of its four sides. They announced that the one of them who most quickly threw himself into the fire would earn the honor of “<italic>haberse criado el sol</italic>” (having brought up the sun).<sup>53</sup> The most courageous and fearless of them rushed into the fire, descended into the underworld, and left the other gods wondering from which direction the sun would rise. After a while, the sun rose some distance into the sky and stopped. The gods sent a messenger to inquire about the sun’s situation, and they learned that the sun refused to move until they—the gods—had been destroyed. Hearing this, some of the gods were afraid and others were angry. One of them, Citli, fired three arrows at the sun: the first flew beneath the sun, and the second and third also missed their mark. Enraged, the sun took hold of one of these arrows and hurled it back at Citli. The arrow pierced Citli’s chest, and the <italic>teotl</italic> died. Witnessing this, the <italic>teteo</italic> agreed to sacrifice themselves in a desperate act that would force the sun across the sky. Xolotl administered this sacrifice. Using a large knife, Xolotl opened the <italic>teteo</italic>’s chests, killing them and then sacrificing himself. In the aftermath, “Each of them left behind the clothes they had worn (which was a blanket) for their devotees to have in memory of their devotion and friendship. And thus satiated, the sun made its way.”<sup>54</sup>
         </p>
         <p>After recounting the myth of the sun’s origin and the gods’ sacrifice for its life-sustaining movement, Mendieta describes how the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> were fashioned from the <italic>mantas</italic> of the <italic>teteo</italic>. Devotees found the <italic>mantas</italic> and placed within them <italic>ciertos palos</italic> (certain sticks) in which they made a notch to hold “por corazon unas pedrezuelas verdes” (some small green stones as hearts) along with snake and <italic>tigre</italic> (literally tiger, but likely ocelotl) skins placed in the bundle. Mendieta explains, “This bundle they called a <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> and they gave each one the name of the demon who had supplied the blanket.”<sup>55</sup> Following the chronology presented in this Mexica mythohistory, these were the first <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, and they held within them precious greenstones affixed to sticks covered in animal skins and bound within the sacred garments of the gods. Each <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> received the name of the <italic>teotl</italic> who had worn the manta. These, like other <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, emerged in the immediate aftermath of the gods’ sacrificial deaths, and insofar as they contained hearts, stick bodies, and skins tied in the <italic>teotl</italic>’s clothing, they represented the god and regenerated his/her life in the community.</p>
         <p>In addition to the story of these first gods’ sacrifice and the manufacture of their <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, other mythohistories account for the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> of specific <italic>teteo</italic>, including Itzpapalotl (Obsidian Butterfly), Quetzalcoatl, Tezcatlipoca, and Huitzilopochtli. Descriptions of the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> identified with these deities provide us with details about the specific characteristics of various <italic>teteo</italic>’s sacred bundles. Like the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> of the <italic>teteo</italic> in Mendieta’s account, devotees or <italic>teomamaque</italic> (god-carriers) assembled other <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> in the transitional wake of deities’ auto-sacrificial deaths.</p>
         <p>Although the <italic>Anales de Cuauhtitlan</italic> mentions Itzpapalotl’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, the <italic>Leyenda de los Soles</italic> provides the most detailed account of the goddess’s death and the creation of her sacred bundle. According to the <italic>Leyenda</italic>, the gods found themselves in a situation much like the one Mendieta describes. Nanahuatl (Swollen Gland) sacrificed himself to create the sun, but after appearing in the sky, the sun refused to move for four days. When asked why he had not set, the sun replied, “Why? Because I’m asking for their blood, their color, their precious substance.”<sup>56</sup> The gods arrived at a conclusion similar to that of other accounts: only their self-sacrifice could satisfy the sun. And so, the gods sacrificed themselves, and the sun began to move. The <italic>Leyenda</italic> then explains that in the year 1-Flint, the four hundred Mixcoa were born, and in a subsequent birth event, five more Mixcoa appeared. The sun tasked the four hundred Mixcoa with the responsibility of using flying darts to satisfy his thirst, but the young Mixcoa played with the darts instead of sating the sun’s thirst. When they hunted, they selfishly kept the game for themselves. They reveled in promiscuity and stayed drunk. Frustrated with the four hundred Mixcoa, the sun told the five youngest Mixcoa siblings to murder “the ones who fail to say, ‘Mother, Father!’” And they did.<sup>57</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Later, two of the five Mixcoa, Xiuhnel and Mimich, left to hunt two two-headed deer that had descended from the sky. The deer transformed into women, and one of the women lured Xiuhnel into her bed with a bloody beverage. Once she had lain with him, she turned on Xiuhnel and chewed open his chest. After witnessing what had befallen his brother, Mimich said, “Alas, my elder brother is eaten.”<sup>58</sup> The second woman invited Mimich to drink with her, but having grown wary of the women, he built a fire and jumped into it. She followed Mimich into the fire and chased after him until noon when a barrel cactus fell from the sky and st(r)uck her. Mimich showed the <italic>xiuhteteuctin</italic> (fire lords) where the body of this woman (now identified in the text as Itzpapalotl) lay, and <italic>tlatiya</italic> (they burn her).<sup>59</sup> Five colored flints “shined forth” from her pyre, and Mixcoatl, husband of Chimalman, took the white one.<sup>60</sup> Of the five, this was the only flint they wrapped up, and “Mixcoatl made the white flint his spirit power, and when they had wrapped it up, he backpacked it. Then he goes off to make conquests in a place called Comallan, backpacking the flint. It’s his spirit power, Itzpapalotl.”<sup>61</sup> In the <italic>Leyenda</italic>, Mixcoatl carried Itzpapalotl’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, which contained her remains in the form of a white flint, on his back into battle. The text lists a series of successful conquests Mixcoatl made—among the Comalteca, and in Tecanman, Cocyama, Huehuetocan, and Pochtlan—before encountering his future spouse Chimalman naked. Standing before her, Mixcoatl laid down his shield, took up his dart thrower, and shot at her repeatedly. He missed her eight times (with two shots sailing between her legs), but eventually won a night in her bed. Armed with his <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> (Itzpapalotl), Mixcoatl experienced success on the battlefield, as well as in the bedroom.</p>
         <p>In the <italic>Leyenda</italic>, Mixcoatl’s conquests (and those of his progeny) have their beginning in primordial progenitive events, including the sun’s creation, the <italic>teteo</italic>’s self-sacrifice, the Mixcoa’s misbehavior, Itzpapalotl’s death, and the creation of the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> (Itzpapalotl) that Mixcoatl carries. Despite her central role in this narrative, Itzpapalotl goes unnamed until the Mixcoa point Mixcoatl to her corpse. Itzpapalotl’s descent in the shape of a two-headed deer, her hunt for Mimich, her death by cactus, and her cremation all stem from the creation of the sun, his refusal to move, and the disobedience of the Mixcoa. Viewed alongside Xiuhnel’s bloodthirsty lover, the other two-headed deer, Itzpapalotl seems practically a victim of circumstance.</p>
         <p>In the <italic>Anales</italic>, however, she actively advances upon the four hundred Mixcoa and devours them. In fact, only the White Mixcoatl escapes her by hiding inside a barrel cactus. Itzpapalotl finds this Mixcoatl, who emerges from the cactus and resurrects his Mixcoa siblings. Together with his siblings, he turns on and kills the goddess: “They shot her. And when she was dead, they burned her. Then they rubbed themselves with her ashes, blackening their eye sockets. And when their bundle was finished being made, they all decorated themselves in a place called Mazatepec.”<sup>62</sup> The <italic>Leyenda</italic> and the <italic>Anales</italic> converge and diverge in the details of their accounts. In both, Itzpapalotl pursues Mixcoatl, identified as/with white(ness), and their chase hinges on the appearance of a barrel cactus. In one, the cactus traps and kills the goddess, and in the other, it aids and abets Mixcoatl’s (and the Mixcoa’s) murder of Itzpapalotl. In both, Mixcoatl/the Mixcoa cremate Itzpapalotl and incorporate her biological remains (in the form of either a flint or ashes) into the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> they create. Although their details differ, both texts describe Itzpapalotl’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> as containing her crematory remains.<sup>63</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The story of Itzpapalotl’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> underscores sacred bundles’ transformative and regenerative properties upon their emergence from the afterbirth of divine self-sacrifice. Although Itzpapalotl’s death at the hand of Mixcoatl (and the Mixcoa) results in her transformation into a bundle that contains her remains, the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> is more than mere(ly what) remains. The rescue of her bundle from a burning temple in Cuitlahuacan (quoted above) reveals its material and symbolic significance. Itzpapalotl’s account is in keeping with the mythohistorically established paradigm of <italic>teteo</italic>’s sacrificial deaths at Teotihuacan: the gods perform (auto-)sacrifice, <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> are produced in the mortuary treatment of their remains, and the newly manufactured <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> embody the physically transformed <italic>teteo</italic> for their devotional community. <italic>Tlaquimilolli</italic> manifested the recently deceased, recently rehabilitated <italic>teteo</italic>. Although the <italic>Anales</italic> and <italic>Leyenda</italic> may not catalog all of the contents of Itzpapalotl’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, I maintain that by their nature, <italic>quimilli</italic> contained complete sets of things or bodies transformed through the curative powers of binding. With regard to <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> (extraordinary bundles set apart from other <italic>quimilli</italic> through the transformative event of death), the complete sets corporeally (re)constituted the <italic>teotl</italic> and contained material assemblages specific to him/her. A bundle’s unique contents or coverings were most often produced during the <italic>teotl</italic>’s mortuary preparations; this was the case with Itzpapalotl’s white fire flint and ashes, and as we shall see, it will be the case with the biological remains included in Tezcatlipoca’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>.<sup>64</sup>
         </p>
         <p>With regard to the reconstitution of the <italic>teotl</italic> in his/her <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, the recently deceased <italic>teotl</italic> contributed the bundle’s contents, its wrapping, or both.<sup>65</sup> Las Casas and Pomar indicate that Tezcatlipoca (Smoking Mirror) left his devotees “el hueso de su muslo” (the bone of his thigh) and a mirror.<sup>66</sup> Las Casas embeds the thighbone detail in a footnote explaining that Popocatepetl (Smoking Mountain) takes its name from Tezcatlipoca, whose descent into the volcano incited it. The Popocatepetl narratives differed, Las Casas explains, as to whether Tezcatlipoca merely penetrated the volcano or died there. Regardless, the <italic>teotl</italic> sent his thighbone to Tezcoco, and the Tezcocans, his patrons, proudly devoted themselves to the god and to the veneration of his relic, which they placed in his temple. This last detail—the bone’s location—may indicate that they included it in his <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, but Las Casas stops short of saying so.<sup>67</sup> While Las Casas explains the origin of one of Tezcatlipoca’s relics, an item that may have been wrapped inside his <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, Pomar elaborates on the bundle’s various contents: “There was a polished mirror, the size and measure of half of a large orange, set in a crude black stone. With it were many loose fine stones, including greenstones, emeralds, turquoises, and many other kinds. And the cloth that was closest to the mirror and stones, it was painted with a human skeleton.”<sup>68</sup> According to Pomar, the bundle contained a variety of loose greenstones along with a small mirror set in crudely hewn black stone. Cloths decorated in a skeletal motif surrounded the mirror and greenstones, but he mentions no bones. In sum, these descriptions account for the presence of a mirror and/or a bone in Tezcatlipoca’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>.</p>
         <p>These colonial accounts of the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>’s contents reveal the multiple narrative threads present in Mexica theogonies. By keeping the narrative threads separate, we can examine each independently for the frays left by linguistic, thematic, or iconographic wear that suggest where the various accounts once intersected or knotted. It is important to resist the temptation to harmonize accounts like those of Las Casas and Pomar for at least two reasons—that is to say, to assume that the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> contained both a mirror and a thighbone (though it certainly may have). First, we prevent ourselves from making easy elisions that would lead to conclusions rather than tentative interpretations, and second, we create space to develop a hermeneutic appropriate to the polysemic signifiers of Mexica religion. If we take seriously the nature of mythohistories as Andeanist Gary Urton characterizes them—as having a “potentially equal and simultaneous, and thus fully ambiguous, mythical and historical status”<sup>69</sup>—tentatively interpreting tangled narratives and contradictions allows us to consider their many possibilities. This hermeneutic helps us avoid distorting or manipulating the sources by permitting multiplicity rather than enforcing unity. With respect to Tezcatlipoca’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, tentative interpretations that attend to the polysemic signifiers of Nahuatl and Mexica visual and material cultures facilitate a richer understanding of the god’s relationships to his various embodiments.</p>
         <p>That Tezcatlipoca’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> contained a mirror should come as no surprise given the god’s onomastic, corporeal, and mythohistorical connections to smoking mirrors, in particular, and to obsidian, generally.<sup>70</sup> Tezcatlipoca both is (Lord of) the Smoking Mirror and is identified by the visual or material smoking mirror, which makes it difficult (for us) to distinguish the eponym from its embodied apotheosis. Perhaps, though, this (in)distinction points to other of the <italic>teotl</italic>’s qualities. Olivier suggests as much in the opening lines of <italic>Mockeries and Metamorphoses</italic>: “One must say that the Lord of the Smoking Mirror, as he appears under a variety of guises and names, seems to strive against any attempt at identifying or reducing him. Sorcerer god, master of transformations, he seems to amuse himself in ceaseless metamorphoses to the detriment of the Cartesian investigator.”<sup>71</sup> If, however, we were forced to select one identifying and identifiable (though not invariant) feature of this shadowy sorcerer <italic>teotl</italic>, the smoking mirror seems most obvious and relevant (see fig. 2).<sup>72</sup> A curious object, the smoking mirror reflects a distorted image of the onlooker; acts as a vision apparatus comparable to the <italic>tlachiyaloni</italic> (instrument for seeing); and emits (or at least affects) smoke, a signifier of fire, volcanic activity, and rain clouds.<fig id="fg2" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>According to Sahagún, the Mexica identified two types of mirror stone—one white and one black—which varied in their surface quality and reflective properties. He explains, “Of these mirror stones, one is white, one black. The white one—this is a good one to look into.…They named it the mirror of the noblemen, the mirror of the ruler. The black one—this one is not good. It is not good to look into.…They say it is an ugly mirror, a mirror which contends with one’s face.”<sup>73</sup> Tezcatlipoca’s smoking mirror was of the black variety and may have been fashioned from pyrite or obsidian.<sup>74</sup> Tezcatlipoca held deep connections to obsidian, a volcanic rock. We have already seen Tezcatlipoca enter and excite Popocatepetl. According to Olivier, the <italic>teotl</italic> Iztli (Obsidian) was “one of Tezcatlipoca’s avatars.”<sup>75</sup> Nicholas Saunders draws an even more intimate connection by identifying “obsidian’s apotheosis as Tezcatlipoca.”<sup>76</sup> Materially and pictorially, the mirror clearly (re)presented Tezcatlipoca. In fact, archaeologist Michael Smith goes so far as to say that “most or all obsidian mirrors suggest the presence of the cult of Tezcatlipoca.”<sup>77</sup> It seems fair to say, then, that the Lord of the Smoking Mirror stood in/as both <italic>tezcatl</italic> and <italic>iztli</italic>, and that the mirror bundled inside the <italic>teotl</italic>’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> stood in/as Tezcatlipoca. The mirror simultaneously signified his corporeality, his mythohistory, and his name.</p>
         <p>Tezcatlipoca’s mythohistorical embodiment of the reflective stones <italic>tezcatl</italic> and <italic>iztli</italic> locate him at, with, and/or as significant places, peoples, events, and animals. For instance, the <italic>ocelotl</italic> (jaguar), a frightening predator popular among transmogrifying <italic>teteo</italic> and <italic>nanahualtin</italic> (sorcerers), figures prominently in Tezcatlipoca’s imagery (see fig. 3). The jaguar’s physiological ability to see in the dark paralleled the unique ability of diviners to see in remarkable ways, times, and places. Saunders situates the Mexica fascination with the shiny surfaces of mirrors in the nexus between jaguars and diviners: “The widespread notion [that a mysterious light enabled diviners’ night vision] appears linked to the ‘divinatory seeing’ and hunting of game animals by human and animal predators that, in Central and South America, associates shamans with the brightly colored and mirror-eyed jaguar (<italic>Panthera onca</italic>).”<sup>78</sup> The Mexica understood jaguars in relation to themselves. Like jaguars, humans were efficient predators; like jaguars, diviners used mirror eyes to see into the dark; and like jaguars and diviners, Tezcatlipoca had extraordinary vision.<fig id="fg3" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>From a devotee’s perspective, the mirror’s presence in Tezcatlipoca’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> reflected the <italic>teotl</italic>’s extraordinary ocular abilities, abilities that he extended to his religious associates through two of the <italic>teotl</italic>’s enchanted technologies/technologies of enchantment: the smoking mirror and <italic>tlachiyaloni</italic>.<sup>79</sup> The smoking mirror and <italic>tlachiyaloni</italic> exemplify Tezcatlipoca’s vision(ary) capabilities by enabling devotees to see and communicate with the <italic>teotl</italic>. The <italic>tlachiyaloni</italic> appears in several codices, and texts including the <italic>General History</italic> and Pomar’s “Relación” describe its use in association with Tezcatlipoca (see fig. 4).<sup>80</sup> According to Durán, the <italic>tlachiyaloni</italic> was “like a mirror, a highly polished and glistening round plate of gold, and it was understood that in this mirror he could see all that happened in the world.”<sup>81</sup> Sahagún records a similar description and use of the <italic>tlachiyaloni</italic>. Tezcatlipoca and other deities, including Ixcozauhqui, Tlacochcalco, Yaotl, and Omacatl, carried the ocular instrument and looked through the hole in its center, which Sahagún characterizes as “like a small window” (see fig. 5).<sup>82</sup> Indeed, drawings of Tezcatlipoca and Omacatl in the <italic>General History</italic> show them holding a <italic>tlachiyaloni</italic>, and the text indicates that the apparatus was essential to Omacatl’s <italic>inechichihual</italic> (array).<sup>83</sup>

         <p>Together the smoking mirror and <italic>tlachiyaloni</italic> facilitated visual exchanges between Tezcatlipoca (or his <italic>teixiptla</italic>) and his devotees. For his part, Tezcatlipoca used the <italic>tlachiyaloni</italic> to extend the range of his vision and perhaps to see into the <italic>itonalli</italic>, the fate or fortune, of his devotees.<sup>84</sup> Sahagún does not mention the <italic>tlachiyaloni</italic> in his overview of Toxcatl, but in three of the accompanying images, Tezcatlipoca’s <italic>teixiptla</italic> holds the vision apparatus in his left hand.<sup>85</sup> These images raise the question of how the device might have altered, enhanced, or extended the vision of the <italic>teotl</italic>’s <italic>teixiptla</italic>. Given the extensive training this <italic>teixiptla</italic> underwent in becoming Tezcatlipoca, including learning to speak like the <italic>teotl</italic> and play his flute, it seems likely that he would have learned how to magnify his vision using the <italic>tlachiyaloni</italic> as well.</p>
         <p>The <italic>tlachiyaloni</italic> extended the <italic>teotl</italic>’s vision (or that of the <italic>teixiptla</italic>) deeper into the human lifeworld (and possibly even into the minds of people), and conversely, the mirror enhanced devotees’ ability to see their god. Mythohistorical accounts explain that priests, <italic>teomamaque</italic>, and dedicated devotees saw Tezcatlipoca through the mirror in his <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>. Pomar reports, “They say that in this mirror, they saw Tezcatlipoca many times in the form that has been described and painted.”<sup>86</sup> Taken together, Tezcatlipoca’s reflective array facilitated a visual exchange, not unlike that of Hindu <italic>darṣan</italic>, between the <italic>teotl</italic> and his people, including both priests and lay adherents. Not only did Tezcatlipoca’s devotees see the deity in the mirror, but they also heard his voice through it. Pomar’s account continues: <disp-quote>
               <p>When the ancestors of those from Huitznahuac came…he spoke with them in a human voice through this mirror, so that they would continue and neither stop nor settle in the places that in coming along they wanted to stop and stay until they arrived at the land of the Chichimec Aculhuaque. When they arrived he did not say anything else, and because of this, they settled there. And they found that afterward it no longer spoke to them, except sometimes they saw it in dreams and it told them some things that they did afterward: and they were the priests of his temple that were his caretakers and servants, that this was a very rare occurrence.<sup>87</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>We know from the descriptions of other <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>’s origins that the bundles were almost always manufactured after the death of a deity, and Pomar’s account gives the impression that the bundle did much more than simply “represent” the <italic>teotl</italic>. According to this story, the mirror included in Tezcatlipoca’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> brought him—face and voice—to the eyes and ears of his caretakers. The <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> seems to have been the functional—if not ontological—equivalent of Tezcatlipoca’s body. Tezcatlipoca’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> sensed, perceived, and communicated on behalf of the deity, much as we might expect his <italic>teixiptla</italic> to do.</p>
         <p>Tezcatlipoca’s bodily presence in the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> brings us back to Las Casas’s point about the significance of the thighbone the <italic>teotl</italic> sent to the Tezcocans. Tezcatlipoca and Popocatepetl share an onomastic element: <italic>popoca</italic> (to smoke, give off vapor). Their shared signifier—smoky steam—began with Tezcatlipoca’s descent into the fiery mountain, where he lost his leg and gained an obsidian mirror prosthetic. Olivier identifies the leg bone that Tezcatlipoca sent to the Tezcocans as “the most important element of his bundle.”<sup>88</sup> Given the connotation of completeness associated with <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, I am hesitant to follow Olivier’s valuation of one element in the bundle over another. However, the significance of the thighbone in ritual sacrifice deserves our attention, and devotees’ understanding of the femur in relation to “<italic>teotl</italic>” extends beyond the importance of including the physical remains of <italic>teteo</italic>, be they ash or bone, inside <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>.</p>
         <p>Itzpapalotl’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> demonstrates the importance of including in the bundle some physical rem(a)inder of the <italic>teotl</italic>’s corporeality. The femur stands out as having received special ritual attention during Tlacaxipehualiztli (Feast of Men Flaying), and femurs recovered by archaeologists substantiate colonial accounts of their posthumous modification. During Tlacaxipehualiztli, a <italic>veintena</italic> (twenty-day) festival of the <italic>xiuhpohualli</italic> (solar day count), Mexica priests honored Xipe Totec (Flaying Lord) by sacrificing a captive and flaying his corpse. Ritual participants wore the flayed skins as an act of atonement, and the penitents shared the offerings they received with the captor. After the skin wearers had removed the skins and deposited them in a cave, the captor cleaned himself—he had fasted for twenty days for his captive—and erected an <italic>itlacaxipehualizquauh</italic> (flaying men tree) in his courtyard as a sign of his status. From the pole, he hung the captive’s femur, <italic>xicolli</italic>, and heron feathers: “And he completely wrapped the thigh bone in paper; he provided it with a mask; and this was called the <italic>malteotl</italic> (captive-god).”<sup>89</sup> The word <italic>malteotl</italic> occurs in the <italic>General History</italic> only once, but its significance relative to Tlacaxipehualiztli and to the (leg) bones included in <italic>teteo</italic>’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> brings to mind the prominence of osteological material and skeletal symbolism in Mexica religion.</p>
         <p>Despite the absolute proliferation of images and accounts detailing human sacrifice and the related practices of flaying and dismemberment, on one hand, and the pronounced place of skeletal motifs in Mexica iconography, on the other, we seem to know surprisingly little about what the Mexica thought about human bone(s).<sup>90</sup> That is to say, the display of skulls on Templo Mayor structures and the presence of human and animal bones in sacred precinct caches make the skeleton’s importance undeniable. By contrast to their descriptions of other body parts, our sources are largely silent as to Mexica philosophical or physiological articulations of bones. In <italic>The Human Body and Ideology</italic>, Alfredo López Austin briefly addresses the importance of bone with reference to the femur of sacrificial victims, observing that its name—<italic>malteotl</italic>—“gives some idea of its sacred nature.”<sup>91</sup> Others, including Jill Furst, argue that bones, semen, and seeds are mythohistorically homologous; that is to say, they symbolize the potential of life, the first by returning to the earth and the last by bringing forth new life from it.<sup>92</sup> Grégory Pereira’s analysis of femurs and other osteological remains recovered from grave sites in Michoacan suggests that locals modified skeletal material for use in ritual. Specifically, Pereira observes that the notched femurs he examines may be like the <italic>omichicahuaztli</italic> (bone rasp), which Durán and Tezozomoc tell us was a percussive instrument used exclusively in the funerals of men who had died on the battlefield. Pereira cites studies of incised bones from the Valley of Mexico, including those of Leopoldo Batres, Hermann Beyer, and Hasso Von Winning, but he admits that the poor records of bones’ provenances often complicate drawing close connections between osteological material and the Mexica.<sup>93</sup> The presence of bones in images depicting funerary bundles and their recovery from burials in Mesoamerica emphasize the prominent role osteological materials played in funerary rituals.</p>
         <p>The inclusion of osteological remains in <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> attests to the theological significance of the material, the corporeal, and the human/zoological in Mexica religion. The instrument Tezcatlipoca used to present his visage and communicate his desires during the Tezcocan migration bundled the physical remains of his body: his femur and his (smoking) mirror. Knowing what we do of <italic>quimilli</italic>’s semantics, it seems likely that the Tezcocans conceived of the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> as Tezcatlipoca, the Lord of the Smoking Mirror reembodied. This bundled god-body, like its depictions in codices, carried the insignia appropriate to the <italic>teotl</italic>. The <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> presented Tezcatlipoca with the mirror, his <italic>axcaitl</italic> (possessions, property) and <italic>neixcahuilli</italic> (exclusive thing), as well as with signifiers of his status as <italic>mahuiztic</italic> (something marvelous) and <italic>tlazohca</italic> (valuable, beloved). In so doing, the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> exemplified the constructed or manufactured nature of <italic>teixiptlahuan</italic>.</p>

            <italic>Tlaquimilolli</italic> Wrap-Up</title>
         <p>
            <italic>Quimiloa</italic> (to wrap somebody or something in a blanket) constituted a basic ritual action in Mexica culture. Among the living, the process of wrapping healed broken bones and cured snakebites, it bound the joints of ritual structures, and it prepared humans for their trials in the afterlife. In addition to effecting cures, bundles brought with them a sense of the whole. <italic>Quimilli</italic> (bundle of cloths) referred specifically to a count of twenty capes, a number that connoted completeness in the Mesoamerican vigesimal system. In thinking through <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, those bundles specifically associated with <italic>teteo</italic>, the use of bundles in funerary practices provides an especially important frame of reference. The Mexica wrapped human corpses prior to cremation, and they included personal belongings, such as women’s weaving implements and men’s weaponry, in the bundles. They believed that the individual’s possessions would help them weather the ordeals of Mictlan, and not bundling a corpse amounted to abandoning a person to the harsh elements of the afterlife. Wrapping the corpse was so essential that the Mexica rebuilt the bodies of warriors whose remains could not be recovered by making “corpses” from pine sticks, which they adorned with faces and dressed in ceremonial attire—replete with hawk feathers—prior to their cremation and burial. For the Mexica, wrapping somebody or something in a blanket (re)constituted the person or the thing. In the case of deity bundles, wrapping facilitated the reconstitution of the healed, whole, and complete god-body. Simply put, <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> were both made gods and gods made material.</p>
         <p>As much as we might like to disentangle <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>’s mythic origins from their historical uses, their fabulous mythic lives made possible their powerful historical functions. At their simplest, <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, like <italic>teixiptlahuan</italic> and other living creatures, were mere skin and bones. The cloth, clothing, and/or hides that covered a <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> bound together a <italic>teotl</italic>’s corporeal remains and <italic>axcaitl</italic> (possessions, property). Already here we straddle the ambiguous territories of mythohistory: to say that <italic>teteo</italic> had bodies and property suggests that they existed physically, that they were more than metaphors. And yet, clearly they did and were. The Mexica (and other peoples throughout Mesoamerica and the Americas) created and recreated their gods’ localized embodiments from a multitude of materials, including human ones. They produced <italic>teteo</italic> who became active agents in the world. The <italic>teteo</italic>, whether as <italic>teixiptlahuan</italic> or <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, were vital products of human labor and the religious imagination. If we are able to see <italic>teixiptlahuan</italic> as the localized embodiments of <italic>teteo</italic> by virtue of presenting gods in (sur)face—literally in the skin—then we can see the amorphous mass of <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> as localized embodiments of the gods, too.</p>
         <p>We need not elide <italic>teixiptlahuan</italic> and <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>, or even classify <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> as a type of <italic>teixiptlahuan</italic>. Strictly speaking, the two types of embodiments take different shapes, and they performed different functions. <italic>Teixiptlahuan</italic> manifested <italic>teteo</italic> in elaborate anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms whose verisimilitude must have transfixed onlookers, while <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> took on the amorphous shape of an ordinary bundle of cloths. <italic>Teixiptlahuan</italic> presented recognizable manifestations of <italic>teteo</italic> in state and local ceremonies, and devotees saw, touched, and sometimes tasted the flesh of these localized embodiments. By contrast, <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> remained protected under the watchful guard of <italic>teomamaque</italic> or inside the innermost sanctuaries of their temples. Elsewhere, I argue that the animacy of <italic>teixiptlahuan</italic>—their ability to participate as agents in social relations—derived in part from the reflective capacity of their eyes, which held the devotee’s attentive gaze.<sup>94</sup> 
            <italic>Tlaquimilolli</italic>, by contrast, had no eyes, nor did they reflect the onlooker’s devotion. Rather than highlight the significance of sight and vision in relation to Mexica <italic>teteo, tlaquimilolli</italic>—this “principal” form of deity embodiment—reveal the importance of the gods’ materiality and tangibility.</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Teomamaque</italic> carried <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>—the god’s bodies—on their backs as they followed (the directives of) these same <italic>teteo</italic> across the arid and mountainous terrain of Mesoamerica. The lives—past, present, and future—of the <italic>teteo, teomamaque</italic>, and priests were bound together: the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>’s physical presence weighed on the god-carriers even as their divine guidance urged them forward, and because of the god’s persistent physical presence, devotees felt an obligation to protect their <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> by building a temple for it, even when they settled for the short term. Among the Mexica, Huitzilopochtli’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> functioned as an active agent in the social and religious events that led to their arrival in Tenochtitlan and prominence in the Central Valley. He communicated with his devotees, he motivated the community, and he ensured the foundation of his <italic>altepetl</italic> (community). Mexica cities built up around the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> protected in the heart of their ceremonial centers, which replicated places of origin and embodied cosmological order.</p>
         <p>At base, a <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> simply presented what was left of the god: her skin, ashes/bones, heart, and <italic>axcaitl</italic>. Of course, none of these materials was more (or less) than symbolic. <italic>Teixiptlahuan</italic> were wrapped in skins, and by virtue of being wrapped in cloth, <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> were clothed in skins. The cloth-wrapped pine-stick bones and greenstone heart made up the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic>. They made up the <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> physically and imaginatively. They embodied the god, perhaps not in face, but certainly in form and signifying substance. Not unlike human corpses bundled with the skills of their trade before cremation, a <italic>teotl</italic>’s <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> contained the <italic>axcaitl</italic> (possessions, property) that derived from their <italic>itonalli</italic> (privilege, prerogative) and enabled their ongoing pursuit of <italic>neixcahuilli</italic> (exclusive occupation, business). To the extent that <italic>teteo</italic> were products of the religious imagination, <italic>tlaquimilolli</italic> manifested one more mode of deity embodiment. They replicated neither the form nor substance of <italic>teixiptlahuan</italic>. Instead they presented <italic>teteo</italic>—once again—in body/embodied, and in this bodily form the <italic>teotl</italic> did not look like anybody.</p>
