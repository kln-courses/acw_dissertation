<plain_text><page sequence="1">ECONOMIC RATIONALITY AND HIERARCHICAL GIFT ECONOMIES: VALUE AND RANKING AMONG BRITISH PAKISTANIS PNINA WERBNER University of Manchester This article analyses the tendency of Pakistani immigrants in Britain to transform commodities into gifts, and the rationality of their economic behaviour. Central to the argument is the view that South Asian gift economies may be typified as 'hlerarchical gift economies' and that this is reflected in specific consumption patterns. The argument extends recent discussions of unilateral gifting in South Asia and elsewhere, and focuses on the systematics of gift economies and the way such economies come to be embedded in capitalist, market economies, and in plural societies. Consumption and exchange In his Theory of the leisure class (1950 [1899]), Veblen analysed consumption as display- conspicuous waste and leisure. As display, consumption was, he argued, a primary dimension of individual competition for status. The social dynamics he describes are thus the dynamics of emulation and self-indulgent individualism. He ignores, ap- parently, the use of goods in exchange, as objectifications of valued social relationships; the creation through consumption of social debts which generate trust and underline the durability of relationships. Douglas and Isherwood (1978) criticise his theory on similar grounds, and point to the embeddedness of goods within cultural systems, the metaphoric significance of goods, and their function in the creation and maintenance of social relationships. Consumption, production and social reproduction are insepa- rable features of a continuing cycle. Yet despite some important insights, the substitution by Douglas and Isherwood of a new universal utility 'information' for prior utilitarian approaches is also unsatisfactory. The insights gained since Mauss on the nature of the gift, on sacrifice and on other forms of unilateral or competitive giving are here ignored, as are the systematics of gift economies (see Gregory 1982). Clearly, however, any wholesale rejection of Veblen's brilliant, if cruel, analysis of the dynamics of competitive consumption in favour of a static social structural model would also constitute a retrograde step. Discussions of the gift which ignore its agonistic uses remain structurally static. Con- sumption, as Veblen recognised, has to do with the competitive achievement of status, power and hegemony. The need is to incorporate both features-structure and com- petition-within a single theoretical framework. Although Veblen does not appear to have a theory of exchange, an implicit recog- nition of the pattern such exchanges might assume in stratified societies is provided by Man (N.S.) 25, 266-85</page><page sequence="2">PNINA WERBNER 267 him in his notion of 'vicarious consumption'. He argues, thus, that in order to display waste conspicuously an individual requires a circle of others around him to consume this excess (Veblen 1950: 117). A man's wife, his children, his servants, his slaves and even his competitors are all, according to Veblen, mere vehicles through whom he displays his prodigious wastefulness (1950: 119, 124). I shall argue here that what Veblen calls 'vicarious consumption' is a feature of what may be called 'hierarchical gift economies'; that in order to understand the significance of consumption, we need to shift the focus from individual display to exchange between groups; and that in such economies women, as well as men, may play an active role. My argument extends recent discussions ofunilateral gifting in South Asia and elsewhere (see, for example, Parry 1986; P. Werbner 1988a). Rather than examining the nature of the gift, however, I focus on the systematics of gift economies and the way such economies come to be embedded both in capitalist, market economies, and in plural societies. My specific concern is with the tendency of first-generation Pakistani im- migrants in Britain to transform commodities into gifts, and the rationality of their economic behaviour. The primary groups involved in gift exchange here are joint families or households, structurally and ideologically located within broader ranked marriage circles (biraden). There are approximately 20,000 overseas Pakistani immigrants living in Manchester and its southern suburbs. Although the majority arrived in the city during the 1950s and 1960s as penniless migrants, primarily from smallholding village communities in the Punjab, they have shifted over the years from factory wage labour to self-employ- ment, and many have become relatively wealthy and successful traders and manufacturers (P. Werbner 1987). The community also includes a fair proportion of highly educated professionals who arrived in the city as students and settled there. Today Pakistanis form a stratified community in which wealth, education and Muslim caste origin combine to define internal status and power relations (see P. Werbner 1990). The tendency has been to articulate these relations in the idiom of caste. Such relations are given public expression in the field of communal-cum-religious politics and are ratified symbolically through intercaste hypergamous marriage (P. Werbner 1985; 1989). Although most marriages, in accordance with preferred practices among Muslims, are endogamous, including a high proportion of parallel, cross-cousin and exchange marriages between affines (see appendix 1), intercaste marriages may be regarded as public endorsement of an emergent caste ranking within the local com- munity. I begin by highlighting a contrast between the gift economies of hierarchical, caste-based societies and those oftotemic societies. In the light of this contrast I examine the persistence of caste as a viable cultural system despite far-reaching changes in the South Asian economy. To explain this persistence, key features of 'hierarchical' gift economies need to be appreciated, and these are evident both in sacrificial giving and in customary wedding transactions. My argument is that certain central features of such transactions appear to be widely shared throughout north India and northern Pakistan, both among Hindus and Muslims, and that they have been revived and extended to the British context. Most critically, in order fully to understand South Asian marriage transactions, including those of overseas Pakistanis, the unique position of women as 'gifts' needs to be recognised. Finally it is argued that the gift economy of overseas Pakistani immigrants in Britain is a sub-system embedded within the broader</page><page sequence="3">268 PNINA WERBNER economy, and that this has implications for our understanding of culturally determined production and consumption patterns of ethnic groups in the context of industrial capitahlsm. Hierarchical gift economies The economic strategies of Pakistanis highlight an apparent dilemma. They tend, on the whole, to be very frugal in their daily consumption patterns. They save a great deal and monitor their spending very carefully. They invest in long-term capital assets, in housing and in businesses. In their thrift and farsightedness they seem to subscribe to an eastern version of Weber's Protestant ethic. And yet their weddings are marked by extreme prodigality, often stretching their resources well beyond current financial capabilities. This 'boom and bust' style of spending seems apparently irrational. Indeed, it often appears so to Pakistanis themselves. Yet the size and opulence oflocal weddings continues to inflate. To grasp the compelling nature of what appears to be conspicuous consumption, it is necessary to examine its origins in the South Asian gift economy. It is sometimes assumed that commodity-based economies displace gift economies, or that the two economies may be regarded as successive phases within an evolutionary scheme (for a critique see Gregory 1982; Long 1986; R. Werbner 1989). It has also been argued that 'class-based' societies do not develop real gift economies (Gregory 1982; but see Morris 1986). Yet in South Asia, a highly elaborate ceremonial gift exchange system has historically flourished side by side with a 'tributary' and, more recently, a capitalist, commodity-based economy. In particular, it should be noted, land in contemporary South Asia is a transactable commodity, privately owned and unevenly distributed. My argument here centres on the view that the South Asian gift economy is fundamentally linked to the reproduction of a hierarchical caste system, and may be typified as a 'hierarchical' gift economy, by contrast to gift economies based on the exchange of women (either direct or indirect), the inalienability of land, and on incremental or competitive gift exchange between equals. Hierarchical gift economies entail the exchange of labour (as in the jajmani system), endogamy (the non-exchange of women), hypergamy and a tendency to direct gifts unilaterally towards superiors, on the one hand, and inferiors or dependants on the other. Although the obligation to give, and thus to create a debt, is characteristic of hierarchical gift economies, 'gifts to god'-often in the form ofagonistic giving to communal causes-are a major feature ofthe system. Moreover, incremental competitive exchange between equals frequently takes the form of giving to friends' or relatives' dependants (usually children or wives), rather than direcdy to the competitor himself This is a critical feature of the system, which explains why even apparently reciprocal exchanges between equals are modelled on unilateral giving with its underlying sacrificial premisses1. Totemic and caste systems may be regarded as logical inversions of each other (Levi-Strauss 1966: 109-34). In one, interdependency between groups is created through the exchange of women and food; in the other, it is created through the exchange of services. Schematically, Levi-Strauss's argument may be presented as follows: Totemic clan =n 'imaginary' (i.e. totemic) differences =n nature assimilated into culture (women classified, as natural species, into totemic categories without being regarded as inherently different and thus non-exchangeable) =X objective interdependence in</page><page sequence="4">PNINA WERBNER 269 marriage exchanges (marriage is exogamous between totemic groups) =X 'imaginary' interdependence in food (eating one's own totem is taboo-one eats the totems of others and 'gives' them one's totem to eat). Caste =n 'objective' interdependence (exchange of services, manufactured or agri- cultural goods) =X groups resemble single species in nature (women 'naturally'- inherently or innately - different and thus non-exchangeable) =X species endogamous = prepared or cooked food exclusively consumed within the group. The implications of this are clear: in totemic systems women are culturally equal and exchangeable; in caste systems women are naturally unequal and ranked, with the top ranked women monopolised by the top ranked group (on this monopolistic tendency in class-based gift economies, cf. Morris 1986). Key ceremonial gifts may be regarded as metonymic exchanges ofsubstance between groups or persons who regard themselves as sharing substance in some respect. All gifts are modelled on the exchange of the two primary substances-persons (women) and food-which are often metaphorically equated. Both substances have internal and external manifestations. This may be represented as shown in table 1: Although radical changes in the South Asian economy have resulted in the existence of a large-scale commodity economy and the undermining of mostjajmani relationships (cf. Parry 1979), the corporate, hierarchical nature of caste relations appears, neverthe- less, to have remained intact. It is supported by economic and political interests and is also underpinned by relations to land. Although land in Pakistan is nominally a commodity, and can be bought, sold and rented, among the 'middle peasantry' of independent smallholders, land is regarded as an inalienable patrimony of the biraderi, or the local agnatic lineage or caste group. It is even said that biradeni women who step on 'stranger' land are defiled, while the sale ofland 'belonging' to the biraderi is regarded as an act of betrayal, and biradeni members endeavour to purchase the land themselves rather than let it be alienated (Hamza Alavi, personal communication). Whether in relation to corporate interests in land, political status or power, the commoditisation ofboth labour and land in South Asia appears not to have undermined the hierarchical interdependence between castes with its associated gift economy, although this economy has of course come to be encapsulated within a much broader commodity economy. It is no longer autonomous. The gift economy in South Asia has certain distinctive features which reflect this embeddedness in a commodity-based, stratified society. What has been remarkable in the British context has been the extension of the Punjabi Muslim gift economy, alongside a more extreme reliance on the market and on commodity relations. Rather than disappearing, it has undergone both 'efflorescence' (entailing the introduction of new goods or services, see Strathern 1978) and 'inflation' (in that it involves costlier or more numerous gifts). Both processes TABLE 1. The substance of gifts women food internal reproductive substance substance of nurture and growth external clothing, ornaments, jewellery cooking and serving utensils</page><page sequence="5">270 PNINA WERBNER are evident in Britain. 'Customary' or 'ceremonial' gifting has thus responded to changing circumstances and the reordering of social relationships. It is these social relationships which are the focus of intense gift exchanges. The expansion offriendship networks has been characterised by a conversion ofrelationships often initiated within a context of the commodity economy into relationships defined in terms of an indigenous gift economy. For my purposes here, the fundamental distinction between gifts and commodities relates to the different qualities of relation- ship set up by a transaction. A gift, whether in the form of a good or a service, is essentially inalienable. It implies permanent debt and, reciprocally, permanent trust. Gifts thus objectify the long-term, durable nature of social bonds. In its ceremonial form, the Pakistani gift economy is closely associated, as such economies tend to be (see Gregory 1982), with social reproduction. Marriage and birth are thus pivotal occasions for the initiation and exchange of gifts and the making of sacrifices among Punjabi Muslims. Weddings in particular are associated not only with a transfer- of persons, but also with a vast and complex transfer of valuables and prestations which I describe more fully elsewhere (P. Werbner 1990). The gift economy also marks, however, other types of 'passage' (see R. Werbner 1989). Labour migration, which creates social relationships spanning distant countries, has itself generated its unique expressions of gifting. Labour migrants are, in a sense, incomplete persons, who must re-establish a bond ofsubstance with persons left behind. Departure and return are both marked by cycles of dinners. Migrants are hosted before departing to Pakistan and on their arrival back to Britain, much as they would be if they went on pilgrimage, haj, to Mecca. They carry gifts with them on behalf of relatives and friends of friends in Britain, and return with gifts for those same people, while being, in addition, laden down with the reciprocal gifts entrusted to them by relatives and friends of friends in Pakistan for the latter's own relatives and friends in Britain. They often carry with them several large suitcases packed with jowras (silk outfits for women), electrical goods and children's clothing which they distribute to a wide range of kinsmen in Pakistan. Frequently, they pay both excess-weight and duty because ofthe vast quantities of clothing and fabric they carry. Women accumulate fabric for years in anticipation of such journeys. There is, in effect, a metonymic exchange of 'substance' between Britain and Pakistan in this exchange gifting, recalling the sacred exchange which occurs on pilgrimage (cf. R. Werbner 1989). The exchange may also be said to reproduce the social relations tying British Pakistanis to their natal homes. In the labour migration context, large-scale, long-term, interest-free loans have also become a valuable form of exchange, marking close friendships between, predomi- nantly, male migrants. So too, labour services often provided for the well-to-do in Pakistan by lower caste groups or hired servants, and in particular the cooking and preparation for feasting events, are in Britain extended as personal services provided by, predominantly, female migrant friends or kinswomen. What was, in Pakistan, a hierarchical or commodity relationship, becomes in Britain, where the vast majority have no servants, an exchange between equals, and an integral part of the gift economy. While in their productive activities migrants sell their labour as a commodity, in their friendships and extra-work activities, goods, services and money-often in quite substantial amounts-are exchanged as part of a complex round of festive dinners and ceremonials (see table 2 below).</page><page sequence="6">PNINA WERBNER 271 What we find, then, is a gift economy in which traditional goods-in particular gold and fabric-are exchanged alongside money, food, labour and consumer valuables, within a single economic system in which the principles of 'like-for-like' and in- cremental giving prevail. The systematics ofgifting The hierarchical nature of Punjabi Muslim giving is clearly expressed in the ideas Punjabis hold about sacrificial giving. Gifts to God, including animal sacrifices and offerings of food and money, while always unilateral, are directed either 'downwards', to the poor, in the form of sadqa, or 'upwards' as religious tribute to saints and holy men, whether alive or dead. Alternatively, offerings are made to communal causes such as the building of a mosque or the communal distribution of food at a religious lodge or celebration. This communal feeding 'in the name of God' is known as langer (lit. 'communal kitchen'). Saints, regarded as descendants ofthe Prophet or his close Companions, are members of the highest Sayyid or Siddiqui Muslim castes. Members of these castes, I was told, will not accept sadqa (gifts to the poor), but only nazrana, a religious tributory gift of money, valuable objects or food given as a mark of respect or in gratitude for a blessing bestowed. The remains of communal meals held after religious gatherings (usually fruit or cooked food) are distributed as tabaruk (blessing, thanksgiving) among the people to be taken home; they cannot be thrown away. Again, however, I was told that Sayyids are not offered and do not usually accept these remains. In accord with this distinction between gifts to God via the poor and gifts to God via a superior religious intercessor (a saint), Punjabi Muslims also distinguish between different forms of animal sacrifice: sadqa in which the victim is given to the poor in its entirety; qurbani, the Eid sacrifice, in which a portion is given to the poor and the rest shared among equals, and zabah, in which an animal is given as tribute at a saint's lodge and is usually shared out as Ianger (for a further discussion of sacrifice and offering among Punjabi Muslims see P. Werbner 1988a; 1990). The pattern of religious giving is presented in fig. 1. The hierarchical nature of religious giving was made evident to me in Pakistan by the Saint of Ghamkol Sharif known as Zindapir (the 'Living Saint') who described himself as afakir (ascetic) explaining: 'A fakir is the friend of Allah. Even if he is offered one lakh rupees or nothing to eat for Allah's sake, he would choose to go hungry'. The fakir, he said, denies himself while giving to others: 'This is the way of a fakir. He fasts all day while making sure that everyone else is given food'. He gives not just at his own lodge: 'I have arrangements to host people wherever I go, all over Pakistan and even all over the world. Wherever I go, whether here [at the Lodge] or in Mecca, Allah provides the langer and hospitality for my guests' (Zindapir has a network of lodges providing langer throughout Pakistan and also arranges for the distribution of an open langer during haj). Explaining his generosity, he said: 'I have to be generous because this [the Lodge, or Mecca] is not my house. It is the house of Allah. I too am a guest here. It is easy to be generous in someone else's house. If it were my own house, it might be hard for me to part even with a glass of water'. Commenting on the difference between himself, as a fakir and friend of Allah, and religious experts known as maulvis who are usually paid officials, he said: 'Allah will undoubtedly take the maulvis to Paradise after the Day of Judgement. But Allah gives paradise to his</page><page sequence="7">272 PNINA WERBNER fakirs on earth. I can give of all the blessings of Allah [referring to the enormous crowds his langer had just fed during the urs festival and to the vast gifts of money and cloth he has bestowed on his followers and on the needy]. Only yesterday I paid a maulvi 400 rupees [about ,,15] for giving a sermon in the mosque'. The Saint, friend of Allah, most elevated and closest to him, asks for nothing except from Allah. He is the infinite giver through whom flows the bounty of Allah to his followers below him. If he takes, it is only as tribute, a mark of respect and gratitude made by these followers. By contrast the maulvis, although undoubtedly pious men, are mere receivers, dependent on human generosity, employees of low status and honour. Although this idealised version of Saintly behaviour is not always adhered to, it provides a model which illuminates the systematics of the Punjabi gift economy. To appreciate these systematics a distinction must be made between (1) competitive and balanced gifting between nominal equals; (2) uni-directional gifting which flows from a superior to an inferior; (3) tributary gifting which flows from an inferior to a superior; and (4) 'agonistic', status-marking 'gifting to God' which flows towards communal or religiously-sanctioned causes. In class-based societies, of which South Asian society represents a clear instance, a great deal of gifting is from superiors towards inferiors, and bigmanship is conducted primarily in this form, as well as through competitive giving to axiomatically defined or religiously sanctioned causes (P. Werbner 1985) and to dependants or nominal equals. Hence, agonistic giving is often indirect or destruc- tive/sacrificial (as in feasting), while tributary gifting is always direct. In addition to its hierarchical aspects, gifting is also clearly demarcated by gender and age. The differentiation by gender can be represented as follows (table 2): sacrifice SAINT/COMMUNAL CAUSES offerings/money Zabah Nazrana EQUALS .

Where gift economies are embedded within commodity economies, the 'conversion' of commodities into gifts is more evident than the pure circulation of gifts. It is nevertheless true that gold and cloth, and even some consumer goods, are circulated from one ceremony to another. Loans, too, tend to 'circulate' as one loan precipitates others (see Dahya 1974). The most evident strategy for accumulating gifts is, however, through 'production' (indirectly, within the commodity market) while the 'destruction' of these accumulated gifts is through giving to juniors, inferiors and communal causes. The two spheres of exchange of commodities and gifts-remain, nevertheless, dis- creet. Marriage payments Marriage constitutes the nexus of the Punjabi-Muslim gift economy. It is both the beginning and the culmination of all gifting. The complexity and elaboration of exchange reaches its peak during the wedding cycle. I have already referred to the spectacular scale and elaboration of local weddings. Despite the relatively low earnings of most migrants, the cost of their weddings is considerable. The status-marking aspects of the wedding cycle are evident and obvious. A wedding's size, prodigious expense, abundance of food and opulence mark it out as a potlatch-like demonstration of power and wealth. Elsewhere I discuss the symbolic meanings attached to these displays (P. Werbner 1986). Both the substances and their transactional form relate to a coherent worldview in which the indexical and figurative are united within a single cosmological framework. Here I wish to focus on the marriage transactions which tend to form the central preoccupation of the conveners and the attendant congregation, in order to highlight the way in which apparently conspicuous waste is rational within a given set of cultural premisses. The Pakistani bride, like all South Asian brides, is regarded as a wonderful, marvellous gift, and she must therefore leave her natal home bedecked in precious jewellery, as a queen or goddess. Her person is glorified by her adornment and beauty. Her dowry, seen in non-monetary terms, is simply an enchanting andjoyous decoration of a lovely being. Thus according to Marglin, The wife, like the king, is thought of as the bestower of wealth. The young bride laden with jewelry is the very embodiment of Lakshmi. She brings wealth in the form of jewelry and other items of her dowry. She thus embodies wealth, generative powers and happiness (Marglin 1980: 171).</page><page sequence="9">274 PNINA WERBNER An undecorated bride, by contrast, without a shimmering silk outfit or goldenjewellery, is a sad sight, a shame to her family. Both wife-givers and takers contribute to making the bride's decoration possible. The extra cost of the dowry given by her parents is devoted to setting up an independent household and to affinal gifting, which continues after the marriage. Certain features of the Pakistani marriage payment system thus tend towards mutu- ality and reciprocity. As Tambiah has argued, ... every marriage involves multiple transactions and payments, some unilateral and others reciprocal, so that it could be said that the modalities of bridewealth and dowry co-exist in the same series with one or the other type of transaction gaming dominance and outshining the other in specific situations (1973: 71). Although Punjabi Muslim marriages are characterised, as is usual among Muslims, by a high rate of parallel, cross-cousin and exchange marriages (see appendix 1), marriage payments conform to the north Indian model. There are two important types of marriage payment made by the wife-givers and wife-takers respectively: (a) jahez (known in some parts of the Punjab as daaj)-the gifts to the bride, and to the groom and his family, by the bride's family; (b) veree-gifts to the bride by the groom's family. In addition there are salaami prestations made by a wide range of kin and friends to the bride and groom, and mahr. Mahr (literally 'bridewealth' in the Middle East) refers to the promise of a property transfer from the bridegroom to the bride which is treated as a surety in case of divorce, and is included in the contract. It is often a small symbolic sum, although I am told that some families do bargain over the amount written into the contract during the wedding negotiations. Apparently this is especially true in Pakistan in marriages between wealthy stranger families. In cases where a very high mahr is demanded, the wife-takers expect to be compensated with very high jahez, and vice versa. The vast majority of wedding prestations, whether by parents, close kin or friends, are formally (ifnot actually) directed downwards, to the bride and groom, the descending generation, and this is true also of money invested in setting up a new household. The furniture and electrical goods provided by wife-givers are intended for their daughter's future household. The bridegroom's family most often provides the house, although recent spectacular dowry payments in Manchester have included cars and houses as well. In Pakistan, I am told, among wealthy Punjabi urban families, the girl's parents may buy the couple a 'bungalow' as part of a prestigious and spectacular dowry. The common practice, however, is for the couple to live for a while in the groom's joint familial household or for the groom to invest in a house of his own. This accords with principles of virilocal residence and patrilineal descent. A family's patrimony, its immovable property, is seldom alienated at marriage (although daughters in Pakistan are increasingly claiming their legal share of inheritance, equivalent to one half of the share received by brothers). If symbolically the bride is regarded as a beautifully decorated tribute, the jewellery and all the rest of the wedding prestations which she carries with (and on) her are, nevertheless, extremely costly. For the bride's family the wedding reception (vyah) represents only a fraction, about one third, of the total marriage costs. So too the cost of the personal gifts of gold and cloth made to a range of affinal kin is minor (see below). Their significance transcends their value, however, since they, like the bride</page><page sequence="10">PNINA WERBNER 275 herself, constitute a direct tribute to the wife-takers. A rough estimate of current costs (circa 1986) in Manchester for an average wedding may serve as an example: Wedding reception: ......................................................... k1000-1500+ Jewellery set, including, traditionally, a gold necklace, earrings, ring, bangles of two kinds, a gold watch and a gold forehead piece (tikka): +............................ .1000+ Bridal outfit (if there are two-one is traditionally provided by the groom's family). The outfit includes gold shoes, a gold bag, a gold embroidered large square dupatta and gold embroidered shalwar-kamiz: ....................................... 500 From sixteen and up to thirty other outfits. These include matching shoes and dupattas, as well as handbags in the case of the more expensive suits: .............. 8OO+ Furniture and household appliances (including a fridge, washing machine, etc.): ......................................................... f 1000-2000+ Gifts to the wife-takers, including gold watches, a piece of gold jewellery for the groom's mother, men's three piece suits, and traditional suits for a wide range of new affines: ............... ......................................... k250+ Pre-wedding rites (mainly food): ......................................................... J200+ Video hiring: ........................................................ k2OO+ Transport for guests and to groom's reception: ...........................................................J50+ TOTAL: approximately ........................................................ ?5000-,1;6000 The typical expenditure incurred by the bride's family in 1986 was in the region of ,JC5000. It could be a good deal more or somewhat less, but any sharp reduction in costs would be publicly evident, since not only is the quality and size of the reception manifest, but much of the dowry (and the veree) are publicly displayed and privately dissected. This is a point to stress: marriage payments cannot be regarded simply as dyadic transactions; they invariably take place in front of an audience, and the status implications of such transactions, as Veblen argued, cannot be understood apart from the audiences who both observe and assess them. The wife-takers' expenses are usually somewhat more modest and the reception (valima) represents about half their total ouday. It is usually smaller than the wife-givers' reception, to which are invited a large party from the wife-takers' side as well as the wife-givers' own friends and relatives. On average, the groom's family would expect to spend roughly ,;1000-,Jj1500 on the reception, ,J1000 on the vereejewellery, and ,,;1000 on the veree outfits. In addition, the family may spend an indefinite amount on house purchase or redecoration. There are many other incidental expenses which both families incur and which are usually not even reckoned in the total cost. The smaller pre-wedding rites may, for example, be quite costly; most people spend C,,200-,,C300 on the hiring of a professional video cameraman, a must these days (both for Pakistanis, and, apparently, in the wider society too). In financial terms the wedding costs Pakistanis incur do not differ radically from those incurred by members of the wider society. A survey conducted in 1985 by Bride Magazine found that the average cost of an English wedding was J4;3000, paid primarily by the bride's family. This was in addition to other marriage expenses linked to the costs of setting up an independent household, which are normally covered by the couples themselves from their savings. A recent English wedding I attended cost the girl's parents about 7000. The comparison stops here, however, for in each group</page><page sequence="11">276 PNINA WERBNER the money expended is converted in different ways into feasting and gifts, in order to express and ratify ethnically specific sets of valued relationships. Thus, for example, Pakistani weddings tend to be very large by comparison with English weddings: three hundred and fifty guests is considered a relatively modest reception, the size being made possible by the much lower cost of catering and the total absence of alcoholic drinks. So too, the range of affinal kin honoured with prestations by Pakistanis relates to the broader definition offamilial obligations, while the cost of gifting betweenfriends is often much higher. The persons gifted and hosted, as well as the objects exchanged during the wedding cycle of consumption, are culturally and ethnically specific. As Douglas and Isherwood stress, consumption is a vital source of culture (1980: 57). The daughter as gift Punjabi Muslims say that in Afghanistan a man with many daughters is a lucky man: the custom there is for father to 'sell' their daughters in marriage. They also say that kanya dhan ('daughter-gift' in Hindi) refers to the explicit bargaining among Hindus over dowry which is haram (taboo) according to Islam. Yet the notion of the daughter as a gift given away is implicit in Punjabi Muslim wedding customs, signified by the unilateral gifting ofaffines. A Punjabi Muslim proverb says that tipraya than-'a daughter is a gift belonging to another'. Both the joking reference to the sale of daughters and the rejection of dowry bargaining imputed to Hindus reflect Pakistani abhorrence of the idea of a daughter as a bargaining counter, a saleable commodity on whom an exact and specific exchange value may be placed. Whether the flows of daughters and gifts are in the same or opposite directions, and whether they are weighted in favour of wife-givers or takers, the separation of the two spheres of exchange-of persons and gifts-must be, as Levi-Strauss argued, a starting point for any analysis of marriage payments. Tambiah argues that in hypergamous dowry systems there is an 'exchange of status for wealth'. In the North Indian context, where hypergamous tendencies prevail, this asymmetry in payments serves to buttress the status superiority of the wife-takers over the wife-givers. This asymmetry is supported by further evidence which shows that relations between affines are restncted after marriage and could be described as avoidance (1973: 95). This view of hypergamous dowry practices, Tambiah argues, introduces an apparently irresolvable paradox: Thus North India presents us with the paradoxical situation that the wife-givers are persistent gift- givers and lavish hosts, while they are at the same time excluded from intimate social contact with the receivers [and, it may be added, the receivers' social circle], as that would smack of equality (1973: 97). The paradox calls for an explanation: a marriage alliance supposedly contracted for strategic reasons (to increase family status) precludes alliance-type practices and some of the obvious benefits of a rise in status. Part of the solution, as Tambiah recognises, is that alliance in northern India is deferred a generation, so that avoidance practices are ended at the wedding of the sister's child. It is then,that the mother's brother is included in the wedding party of his sister's family and eats with the family (Tambiah 1973; cf. also Parry 1979 on the mother's brother's participation in his sister's child's wedding). Alliances among Hindus in north India thus tend to be cemented in practical terms by brothers-in-law rather than by fathers.</page><page sequence="12">PNINA WERBNER 277 Nevertheless this does not explain why the wife-givers actively avoid receiving from wife-takers. It is not simply that they are excluded; they exclude themselves. Some Pakistanis, I am told, say that one should not even take a drink of water from the wife-takers, and yet most Pakistani marriages are between status equals2. Among Punjabi Muslims, affinal avoidance features more critically in mamrage between stranger families. Marriages within the lineage, exchange marriages and the resulting multiple relations of affinity make the definition of wife-givers and takers ambiguous and fluid. Nevertheless the fiction that such a division exists is ceremonially maintained (see P. Werbner 1990: ch. 8). My own view is that the logic of dowry is the logic of contradictory messages. The daughter given as a bride is a 'pure gift' and as such a representative of a species (pure virgins) most worthy to be given as tribute to a king or family of superior status. Since she is given as 'tribute', her passage defines her family as inferior, whether they are inferior or not. The wife-givers' prestations which accompany the bride (and which are formally directed to the descending generation) are, however, contrary to appearance, non-tributary; they deny the inferior status implied by the simultaneous gift of the daughter3. The wife-givers' wedding prestations are unilateral, freely given, asserting the high status of the wife-givers by creating a never-to-be-repaid debt. The audience is not simply that of the wife-takers; it includes the kinsmen, friends and acquaintances of the wife-givers themselves. This audience rightly regards the size and spectacular cost of the dowry (as it is intended to be regarded) as signalling the high status of the givers and not their inferiority4. Through such giving wife-givers strive to reach, but can never in theory quite achieve, the clearly defined superior status of wife-takers, conferred upon them by virtue of a single unambiguous act of receiving. The contra- dictory messages conveyed by the 'daughter-gift' and the dowry are most evident where there are real status discrepancies between wife-givers and takers. This explains why the avoidance ofreceiving from wife-takers is most extreme among certain Rajput or Gujerati Hindu caste groups with extensive hypergamous practices. The stress in dowry, therefore, is on generosity, unconditional giving, an unending stream of gifts, all denying inferiority. This gifting takes place both in an ad hoc way and on prescribed occasions: thus, at the seventh month of a daughter's pregnancy, the wife-givers are expected to hold a large dinner-party for the wife-takers and to give each member of the boy's family a gift of clothing. Henceforth they take care of their daughter until the birth of her child, and often take her back home with them. When her post-natal seclusion period ends the wife-givers once again host their affines and distribute gifts. This is repeated at circumcision or haqiqa (the sacrifice made following the birth of a son). Pakistanis say that the burden on the girl's family never ends, and a young bride told me she thought the burden on parents was too heavy; the young couple should work and earn the money needed to marry without relying on parents who could ill afford the costs of paying for the marriages of all their children. Hence, both in bridewealth and in dowry systems a single symbolic act entails further unilateral giving for the indefinite future: in bridewealth systems the son-in-law remains a constant debtor irrespective of his wealth and status; in dowry systems wife-givers are constant givers. This stress on infinite giving (not infinite debt) reflects the idea of non-equivalence between persons and things. In dowry systems, however, this gifting is also regarded as a 'protection' of the daughter and an ensurance of her status and</page><page sequence="13">278 PNINA WERBNER independence, since most of the more costly gifting is directed towards the descending generation. Ideally, therefore, dowry is freely given. In reality dowry often assumes invidious, competitive overtones which make the system open to distortions and victimisation. Dowry, as Goody and Tambiah (1973) argue, may be regarded as a pre-mortem inheritance, directed towards a conjugal fund. This is particularly so where women lack, or waive, their rights to the inheritance of immovable property such as land (as many Pakistani sisters do). The personal dowry a bride brings to a marriage-and indeed the veree she receives-are regarded by Pakistanis as the bride's property to be disposed of as she wishes. Although whatever cash she brings is usually handed over to the boy's parents, she is nevertheless thought to have the right to be consulted over its expenditure, especially if the money is used for purposes other than those for which it was intended, namely the setting up of a separate domestic household. This ideal picture is, however, open to abuse. Thus Vatuk (n.d.) argues that in contemporary India exclusive female rights are not respected: both the dowry and veree she receives are redistributed after the wedding between the different members of conjugal units ofthejoint household with a view to equitable sharing5. By contrast in Britain, possibly because of the greater affluence of most immigrants, the property rights of brides are usually respected. It is said that if a husband takes away his wife's jewellery he takes away her most precious thing, since this is the jewellery she expects to pass on to her own daughter when her time comes to marry. A girl expects to be consulted about the disposal of all the property and cash she brings with her from her natal home. She thus derives her status within the new household from her control over these resources, as well as from her independence in matters of clothing and adornment (the clothing she receives as wedding gifts is usually enough to 'last' her several years). In effect, the bulk of the dowry is utilised to set up an independent household for the newly married couple, even if the division of land among brothers is deferred for a lengthy period. Thus, whereas the daughter as gift defines relativities ofstatus between persons of the ascending generation, the primary flow of gifts is directed towards the descending generation, and this is symbolically represented by the passage ofjewellery from mother to daughter, as land is passed from father to son. As Tambiah points out, 'In India... .the use of dowry to express a status relation between wife-givers and takers does not contradict but meshes with the notion of female property' (1973: 72). These patterns are far more likely to conform to ideal expectations when the marriage is a mutually sought-after alliance between known families, as it usually is in the rural context. The step towards the 'commoditising' of the bride, regarding her simply as an interest-bearing purchase, is, however, a short one once marriage is arranged between stranger families sharing no other interests in commnon. Just as in bridewealth systems a father can 'sell' his daughter to the highest bidder without regard for her welfare, so too in dowry systems a family can 'invest' in a bride. Her worth is then measured entirely in terms of the dowry she brings to the marriage. Where divorce or polygamy are prohibited, as among Hindus, she and her natal family then become extremely vulnerable to extortion and blackmail. This would seem to be particularly likely under certain demographic conditions. (Demographically, polygamy results in a shortage of brides, monogamy coupled with hypergamy or male migration results in a shortage of eligible grooms, since men have a larger age and status pool from which to draw brides-hence the competition for grooms which pushes up the 'price' of dowry.)</page><page sequence="14">PNINA WERBNER 279 Since Pakistanis allow for divorce and polygamy, the extreme iniquities of the distorted dowry system (such as bride murder) appear to be absent in Pakistan.6 This is especially so because most marriages continue to take place between known persons within the biraderi, often between prior affines or consanguineal kin, and many marriages are exchange marriages, involving minimum and balanced dowries (see appendix 1). Pakistani labour migrants, in some ways a privileged group, are even less concerned with dowry size; by comparison to India or Pakistan, Britain is still an affluent society: bank loans and overdrafts are widely extended, cars and electrical appliances are relatively cheap, long-term mortgages are readily available and hence middle-class aspirations easily fulfilled. Although marriage prestations are costly, they are not prohibitive, especially, as we shall see, because children make a contribution towards their own marrage costs. An apparently similar cultural institution may take on a variety of socially and contextually determined forms (Tambiah 1973; Comaroff 1980). Although cross-cul- tural comparisons are notoriously risky, it seems reasonable to argue that the cultural logic of contrasting institutions, regarded as sets of related practices and beliefs, does nevertheless entail consistent material and sociological differences. Pakistanis represent a remarkable instance of a society in which one cultural institution gains hegemony at the expense of its alternative. For despite the fact that Pakistanis follow the marriage and inheritance rules of Islam, they continue to uphold the passage of dowry with all its related beliefs and practices. The very high rate of first patrilateral and other parallel cousin marriages prevailing among Pakistanis, usually associated with bridewealth payments, thus appears to be equally compatible with dowry payments. Undoubtedly, however, it is associated with the relaxation of avoidance rules and, as a marriage lasts, with a growing tendency towards symmetry in exchange, despite the fact that dowry continues to be 'oriented' (Tambiah 1973: 103). Mahr (i.e. bridewealth), the salient marriage payment in the Middle East, has been reduced to a token sum, a surety in case of divorce. Hence, despite the wide range of marriages with close kin permitted in Islam and the tendency towards marriage between status equals, the logic of dowry, with its material implications, is upheld, although its most extreme manifestations are absent. It seems likely, then, that both property devolution and strategies of mobility will tend to differ among the Middle Eastern and Punjabi peasantry, despite the .7 apparently similar economic bases and kinship practices in these societies The inflation of the gft economy The logic of reciprocal (as against unilateral) gifting among Pakistanis is an incremental logic, so that a gift extended repays a prior debt and sets up a new debt. Each gift is thus notionally composed of a part which represents a repayment and a part which represents the gift proper. In theory, therefore, transactions could continue at the same level after the first repayment. The fact that the value of reciprocal gifts has tended in Britain to escalate over time relates both to the embeddedness of gifting within an inflationary commodity economy, and to the social mobility of labour migrants. The rise in incomes has generated a continuous rise in gift values as migrants accumulate more wealth and raise their standard of living. Because even reciprocal giving has sacrificial undertones, it implies giving in excess, beyond the limits of what is easily available. Hence its sensitivity to a rise in incomes.</page><page sequence="15">280 PNINA WERBNER Competitive, or symmetrical gifting occurs between notional equals, and is extended between kinsmen or friends at the birth of children and on other festive occasions. The gifting culminates in the salaami ('greeting' or 'peace' gift) extended to the daughters or sons of friends and kinsmen at their marriages. In the mid-1970s the standard salaami extended by friends and wedding guests was about five pounds, while close relatives such as the mother's brother normally gave salaami of between twenty and fifty pounds. The inflation of salaami was evident in a wedding I attended in the mid-1 980s, in which the standard salaami was about twenty pounds, with the mother's brother giving on this occasion (as host of the bride's wedding reception) two hundred pounds. This fourfold increase in salaami over ten years cannot be accounted for fully by inflation, and reflects, I think, the general rise in expectations as more members of the community become affluent. The pressure to raise salaami is supported by the culturally prescribed incremental tendency inherent in such gifting, as well as by its sacrificial undertones. Unilateral payments to the descending generation in the form ofjahez or veree have also been subject to inflationary pressures. Again, the escalation in cost here is not simply due to inflation for, as Bhachu (1985) argues, it is also linked to changes in the eaming capacity of daughters. In a detailed discussion, Bhachu examines the transfor- mation of a gift economy in the context of a changing labour and commodity market. Comparing the dowries of mothers and daughters, she argues that daughters in Britain utilise their earnings to purchase a prestigious and highly inflated personal dowry (of clothing outfits, bags and shoes), and that both the quantity and quality ofthese particular items has, as a result, vastly increased in Britain. She argues, further, that the girl's own contribution to her dowry has enhanced her power to control it at the expense of the groom's kin group. All the various changes she lists in detail stem, as she sees it, from the capacity of east African Sikh daughters to work and earn an independent income in Britain. And yet, she argues, the major components of the Sikh Punjabi daaj have remained stable over time despite the entry ofwomen into the labour market and their acceptance of contemporary local fashions and current British consumer aspirations: ...items considered to be suitable daaj gifts (gold sets, silk saris, etc.) have persisted rigidly. In this sense, the general conservatism of the east African Sikhs which is obvious in other spheres of life.-makes them and their womenfolk translate their wealth in a classical manner that neither differs markedly from that of high status Hindus nor has changed radically over the past seventy years despite two migrations-from India to Africa and from Africa to Britain (1985: 237, her emphasis). In Bhachu's view, the major change in the form of dowry relates not to the content of the personal dowry a girl brings with her to her new home, but to the diminished role of the joint and extended family, both as gift extenders and as gift receivers (cf. Vatuk 1973). I might add to this that such changes in the source of dowry can be expected to set up new axes of competition: between girls among themselves, and between daughters and parents (significantly, Bhachu reports that parents continue to provide all the gold jewellery and much of the household equipment). Like their Sikh counterparts, many British Pakistani daughters work (mainly as machinists) and either buy some of their dowry directly or-more often-give their earnings to their parents who use it to buy the dowry. Thus, for example, two sisters I know bought their own houses from their earnings, as both were marrying grooms coming to Britain from Pakistan.</page><page sequence="16">PNINA WERBNER 281 Despite this change, however, and its inflationary impact on marriage payments, there is little evidence that among British Pakistanis the importance of the joint family has been undermined by the change in the labour market, or that marriage payments have ceased to be made between and to a wide range of kinsmen and affines. Indeed, it seems to me that the range of persons involved in a son's or daughter's mamrage has been extended, to include newly made friends and acquaintances, without radically undermining the significance of close family relationships. The bride's family continues to give gifts to the close affines of the groom, and particularly to his mother, sisters and sisters-in-law. As we have seen, all mamrage prestations have escalated in value, and not only those provided from daughters' earnings. Mothers, too, it must be remembered, have become earners, as have brothers, while in business fanilies the unpaid labour of all household members contributes to the general rise in family income. The ability ofthe parental generation to earn more, and the continued reliance on kinsmen and friends, would seem to counterbalance the significance of the earnings of daughters. It is noteworthy that women are favoured in the distribution ofjahez. This is not surprising, for women are the main 'dealers in cloth' among Punjabi Muslims-linking together families and friends through extended and complex exchanges of cloth and other goods. Whereas, for Veblen, women remain passive 'vicarious consumers', living objectifications of their husbands' superior status, such a picture misses the active role women play in connecting households through gifting (cf. Eglar 1960). Indeed, they seem to control this economy and are the primary public exchangers or givers of goods. Men organise the largest feasting events in which whole families are hosted, and they usually make most cash transactions (in private, since these are not condoned). It may be argued that the key role played by Punjabi women in the gift economy relates to theirpivotal position in managing the inter-household domain (seeP. Werbner 1988b). British Pakistani women store much of the family savings in the form of a valuable which was, in the 1970s, a very profitable commodity-gold. While they do not usually sell their gold unless circumstances force them to (since the possession of gold jewellery reflects on the family's social status), they may and do sell it in financial emergencies, either to help their husbands in their businesses or to feed their children. Women transmit their gold jewellery to their daughters on their marriages (usually it is melted down and redesigned according to current fashions). Within the domestic circle the fact that they are property owners in their own right increases their influence, especially as they become more senior. Decisions regarding property transactions and expenditure incurred at a wedding are usually taken jointly, by both parents, and it is only through coordinated efforts that they can manage to sustain their social circle successfully. The conspicuous gifting and feasting at weddings is thus for Pakistanis a means of objectifying their social relations, inseparable from the complex daily exchanges be- tween affines and kinsmen, or between friends and acquaintances. Iftheir social relations are seen to lie on a continuum from intimacy and trust to casual acquaintance, then visiting, gift-giving, hosting and mutual aid are attempts to clarify and objectify what is, in a very real sense, indefinable. In weddings, as on other occasions, Pakistanis are making statements-sometimes invidious-about their relative intimacy with various people. The indexical elaboration of the wedding, with its series of exclusive and</page><page sequence="17">282 PNINA WERBNER inclusive rites, its prescribed gifting and complex feasting, affords an opportunity for such invidious statements and investments in valued relationships to be made. Conclusion: gift economies in the context of capitalism Gifts and commodities differ in certain fundamental respects. The Marxist conception of commodity 'fetishism' as a unique feature of capitalist societies refers specifically to the illusion that things have an autonomous exchange value, independently of the labour power which in reality creates this value (for a full discussion see G.A. Cohen 1978). Given their apparently autonomous value, commodities are alienable from their producers and transactors. Gifts, by contrast, are inalienably imbued with the spirit of their givers, and thus objectify social relationships which precede them. They are accorded a rank ordinal value rather than a measured exchange value. Moreover, the value of specific gifts is not fixed, but accorded in relation to the giver and his ability to give. The value of a gift is also often higher if it is the product of the personal labour of the giver. Gifts thus never have a simple, fixed market value. Like commodities, however, the customary objects transacted as gifts also appear to assume a transcendent quality which relates to the cultural value ascribed to them. Whether the items exchanged are pigs, cattle, beads, gold jewellery, silk or cash, their accumulation often becomes a target in itself. Their cultural value derives from their place on a cultural grid (see Sahlins 1976: 148-61): they may be valued for their aesthetic qualities, the labour involved in producing them (as in the case of gold jewellery or silk), their exoticaliy powerful source (as in the case of shells or beads, cf R. Werbner 1989), or their anthropomorphic qualities (as in the case of pigs, cattle or cassowaries). In any event, these culturally valued things assume an independent power and the logic of their inflation or replacement is beyond the manipulation of the individuals who transact them. Gift economies in industrial capitalist societies are embedded in commodity econo- mies. Once commodities have been converted into gifts they 'behave' as gifts: they are customary, ranked, personalised, inalienable. Yet they are also, as we have seen, responsive to changes in the market-to inflation, relative scarcities, and current fashions. Moreover, in some instances, notably in the case ofcash and gold, the valuables passed as gifts are also commodities and are sometimes used as such; in other words, they may be reconverted. At the same time women, as 'person-gifts', may be com- moditised, although this may be regarded as a perversion of the system. In such cases the system is distorted and the gift economy comes to be conceived of by transactors primarily in commodity terms. The movement back and forth is a typical characteristic of contemporary gift economies. As Gregory has noted The essence of the PNG (Papua New Guinea) economy today is its ambiguity. A thlng is now a gift, now a commodity, depending upon the social context of the transaction. A pig may be bought as a commodity today so that it can be used in a gift exchange tomorrow. It is because of this ambiguity that the concept of dualism, with its clearly defined traditional sector, must be abandoned. The coloni- zation of PNG has not produced a one-way transformation from 'traditional goods' to 'modem goods', but complicated a situation where things assume different social forms at different times and in different places (1982: 116). Gift economies tend to focus around events marking social reproduction, and indeed for Pakistanis weddings constitute the nexus of the gift economy, drawing together primary symbolic, economic, personal and communal themes. The significance of</page><page sequence="18">PNINA WERBNER 283 weddings for communities of labour migrants is particularly salient, for they draw together and codify ongoing processes and transformations. If, as Sahlins has argued so persuasively, the use-values of objects are determined culturally within a system of meanings, the imperative to give or to accumulate certain valued objects imbues these objects in any single society with a transcendent force. Hence the woman who publicly displays her gold jewellery (gifts from her parents, matrilateral kinsmen and affines) is signalling her wealth of social relations as well as her social standing in the community. Gold jewellery is thus both personalised and seen in quantitative terms, as a measure of value or status. Indeed, the investment of scarce resources in expensive saris or gold jewellery may well be, from a purely economic perspective, 'irrational'. Its rationality is rarely questioned, however, since its use-value is so profoundly naturalised. Even migrants who question the rationality of gifting are ultimately unable to escape from its inexorable logic, given their con- tinuing reliance on the social relationships which the gifts objectify. This has important implications for the study of ethnicity in capitalist societies. Counterbalancing the alienation which-from a Marxist perspective- stems from commodity fetishism, is the re-incorporation of commodities as gifts within specific culturally valued systems, in which they objectify morally binding relationships. The culturally unique expression of relations through gifting and hosting highlights the ethnic distinctiveness of a group, while at the same time it also allows for transactions to be initiated beyond currently established boundaries. The inter-household domain in which such gifting occurs is, in a sense, the stronghold of ethnic consciousness since it embraces almost every member of the group. This domain is perpetuated and reproduced through the extension of personal gifts and services, and through hosting and feasting on domestically important occasions. Consumption patterns are not, then, simply a matter of individual display, as Veblen thought. Nor can a man's circle of dependants and friends be regarded merely as vicarious consumers, although the unilateral and hierarchical features of much gifting make them appear so. Hierarchical gift economies relate to the reproduction of inter-household relationships in stratified (and sometimes ethnically plural) societies. Moreover, if the gift economy is not autonomous, neither is the capitalist economy. Crucial functions of rearing, reproduction and consumption remain within the domain of the household and its sphere of sociability, and these underpin industrial relations in the market place. NOTES This article is based on fieldwork conducted among Pakistanis in Manchester between 1975-78 and supported by the SSRC (UK), and has been supplemented by further short fieldwork periods during the following ten years. The paper was first presented to the South Asian Anthropology Annual Meeting on Consumption, in September 1987, and I should like to thank the participants at the meeting for their useful comments. In revising the article, I benefited greatly from reading a series of unpublished articles on New Guinea society by Marilyn Strathemr and I would like to thank her for generously sharing her ideas in this way. I am also indebted to Tim Ingold for his useful comments and to Richard Werbner for first pointing out to me the key equivalence of land and labour in determining two types of gift economy in different societies, for encouraging me to use the notion of a 'hierarchical' gift economy, and for hls comments on an earlier draft of this article. 1 Hence while I agree with Parry that south Asian gifting is modelled on sacrificial giving, I cannot agree with him that other kinds of customary reciprocal prestations (such as vartan in north India) do not 'contain the [spirit of the] donor' (1986: 463). Most incremental exchange is in the long run also</page><page sequence="19">284 PNINA WERBNER reciprocal, but this does not mean that the gifts and services exchanged do not personify valued relation- ships. In the South Asian context where social exchange is often through giving to dependants (women and children) the sacrificial connotations of exchange are particularly evident, since such giving contains the idea of regeneration or renewal. Indirect giving of this type also takes the edge off agonistic exchange between equals since, instead of the challenge of direct giving between men, there is indirect giving through their dependants. This sustains the facade of equality between kinsmen or friends while allowing for competitive incremental (and reciprocal) exchange. 2 This saying appears to be common throughout north India (see Parry 1986: 461). 3 Parry argues that the 'merit of the gift is contingent on that of a worthy recipient' (1986:460, my emphasis) - and, I would argue, on its value for the donor: the greater the value the greater the sacnfice and the higher the worth of the recipient should be. Moreover, mentorious behaviour confers status even when not directly sought. Whlle maintaining, as does Raheja (1988), that Hindu unilateral gifts/offenngs (dana) are expiatory, removing 'inauspiciousness' from donor to recipient, Parry thus stresses the central ideological role of such gifts in the reproduction of a hlerarchical order. Raheja's bold denial of the ideological primacy of hierarchy in favour of 'ritual centrality' is more problematic, but its limitations cannot be dealt with here. Briefly, she conflates two distinct categories of dan: expiatory offer- ings directed to protective deities and mediated (with few exceptions) by Brahmins, and exorcistic offerings removing afflicting spints/ghosts and mediated by lower castes. Exorcism always precedes expiation, which restores the proper relationship between men and gods. In the Hindu wedding ntuals the ntual giving of the bride conforms to the symbolic structural model of gifts to deities (Raheja 1988: 136). Moreover, the symbolic ranking of food transactions among Hindus is an integral part of the Hindu 'hierarchical gift economy' and may be regarded as a symbolic inversion of the movement of women: Brahmins who give no women beyond the group are the universal food givers (their food is pakka to all); servant castes who receive women from no-one are the universal food recipients. 4 I am indebted to Richard Werbner for this point, and for the more general argument that marriage prestations should not be regarded as dyadic, since they take place before an audience. 5 In an unpublished paper presented at Berkeley in 1980 Vatuk elaborated this view. 6 Recent reports in the British press indicate, however, that there is growing dowry extortion and maltreatment of wives among both Muslims and Hindus in Britain. 7 The incidence of patrilateral parallel cousin marriage among Pakistanis is comparable to that in the Middle East, and is certainly far higher than its incidence among other groups permitting such marriages, such as Tswana, where FBD marriage between real brothers' children is extremely rare and 'alliance' marriages with matrilateral cross and parallel cousins prevail.
