<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT ACQUISITIONS Out the Window, 1940 Arthur G. Dove, American, 1880-1940 A painting by Arthur G. Dove, whose work fore- shadowed as long as 50 years ago some of the most recent trends in American painting, has been purchased for the Museum's collection. The acquisition of Out the Win- dow, painted in 1940, strengthens City Art Museum's holdings in an area where some of the most important artists active since 1900 are still unrepresented. From the earliest stage of his career around 1910, Arthur Dove stood out as an original figure, even among his avant-garde contemporaries who were expressing their reaction to the first appearance of modern European art in this country. Essentially, Dove was a non-figurative painter whose sensory experiences were channeled through a fertile imagination into vivid and personal pictorial images. Inspiration for his work was deeply rooted in the natural world to which he remained faith- ful throughout his life, even while others were venturing into purer forms of abstract painting. To be sure, Dove's work is also "abstract," but how much it owes to the immediate experiences of sight, touch and even sound is not difficult to see when one is familiar with his work as it developed over many years. At times he incorpo- rated fragments of reality into his paintings, much as Robert Rauschenberg does today or as Kurt Schwitters did during his lifetime. Between Paul Klee, his eminent Swiss contemporary, and Arthur Dove there is no direct connection, yet these two artists are not entirely di- vorced from one another. Klee followed directions that were not explored and perhaps not even suspected by Dove. In his own way, however, Dove also felt the need to create a world of symbols, one that Klee himself might have found meaningful. Out the Window, characteristic of Dove's fully de- veloped style, relies for its initial impact on contrasting bands of clear yellows and blues which have been varied through subtle pressures from the artist's brush. These colors are emphasized further by the bands of dark grays and olive greens surrounding them and, because of this emphasis, appear to float above the surface. Both on the surface and in depth, a balance has been achieved by a remarkably sensitive modulation of color and by interestingly varied brushstrokes. It seems quite likely that Dove was not attempting to describe a particular window; perhaps the "window" he had in mind is the one formed by the limits of the canvas beyond which he has created an imaginary landscape in purely visual terms. Arthur Garfield Dove was born in 1880 in Canandaigua, New York. He attended Hobart College and later Cornell where his father hoped he might develop an interest in law. This hope did not last long as, once out of school, Dove began work as an illustrator, quickly developing an easy facility, and soon became interested in painting. Even though his life was never easy, Dove's long as- sociation with Alfred Stieglitz and later with Duncan Philipps saw him through difficult times. Nevertheless, Dove has long been recognized as a major American artist, a position that will surely grow stronger with the passing of time. A sandstone Sardñía, Indian, Kajuraho area, lOth-llth century Gift of Miss Martha I. Love The Kajuraho area in the Vindliya Pradesh section of north central India is the site of some of India's most magnificent religious and artistic monuments. The many temples of the area are widely known in the West for their voluptuous and often erotic sculpture. The 10th century saw a renaissance of Hinduism in many parts of India, and the Kajuraho region, spared the devastat- ing invasions of the Muslims because of its location and l</page><page sequence="2">RECENT ACQUISITIONS political circumstances, provided fertile ground in which this renaissance took root. A new and vigorous foreign dynasty and a re-invigorated Hinduism combined to produce amazing religious monuments: huge complexes of large and elaborately decorated stone temples of high artistic merit. It is certain that it is from this area, al- though it is not known from which temple or site, that the Museum's sardula comes. The concept of the horned, leonine beast with two small, armed figures may be seen in sculpture on temples throughout the area, either singly on or serving as a vertical architectural member or in facing pairs, usually flanking a single figure or pillar. Pieces such as this sardula and other like sculptural themes that may be classified as secondary in terms of size and iconographie importance were nevertheless carved with consummate skill and had an architectural function as a part of the Hindu temple beyond their iconographie message and obvious beauty. They served to balance, blend and unify the other architectural elements and sculptural forms into the unity demanded of the building as a whole. The Kajuraho temples may be considered true and complete sculpture in themselves. This concept of a harmonious unity of the complex and iconographically various elements of the mass of architectural and sculptural forms comprising the build- ing as a whole extended to each individual element as well. The Museum's sardula holds up well within this concept. The massiveness and exceptionally strong cur- vilinearity of the beast are balanced not only by the spatial positioning of the two small figures but also by their tight, voluptuous curves which provide light and vigorous counterpoint. The small attacking figure at the upper right, in particular, demonstrates this harmony. Even as a fragment divorced from the other sculpture with which it was meant to be seen and from the com- plex of the temple itself, the piece retains its sculptural integrity without display devices or intellectual ration- 2 alization. The iconography only reinforces the visual unity; indeed, the visual cannot be separated from the intellectual in Indian religious art. The concept of the large and unquestionably strong beast in juxtaposition with the proportionately smaller figures in attacking and defending positions symboli- cally represents, for the Indian, the active power in and of nature in perfect conflict and perfect harmony. When looking at this piece, and at much of Indian sculpture, one never quite feels that action has been interrupted as in stop-motion photography but rather that action has been brought to a point of order and perfect balance in a statement by the artist of both artistic and mystical truth. A terracotta relief from Bologna A terracotta relief measuring only six inches in diameter and attributed on stylistic evidence to the Bolognese sculptor Giuseppe Maria Mazza, 1635-1741, has recently come to City Art Museum through the generous interest of Mrs. Robert Corley. Of all the Bolognese sculptors active in the last quarter of the 17th century and until well into the 18th, Giuseppe Mazza was the most ac- complished and the most productive. He was skilled in the use of terracotta and worked with equal facility in marble and stucco. The latter medium was used for the extravagant decoration of the ceilings in the Palazzo Widmann and the Ca' Foscarini ai Carmine in Venice. For more than a century Bologna nurtured the talent of sculptors who formulated a graceful and at times even a forceful style that is still not widely known outside Italy. Among the contemporaries of Giuseppe Mazza are Giovan Battista Bologini, Angelo Gabriello Piò and Filippo Scandellari, whose terracotta relief The Expul- sion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, 1758, was acquired by the Museum last fall.</page><page sequence="3">The Museum's newly acquired relief represents the classic theme of the Madonna and Child, a favorite sub- ject in Mazza's repertory. One sees in this artist's work, whether large or small, that he repeatedly varied the at- titudes of the figures and never failed to bring them into a harmonious relationship. The Madonna's facial ex- pression and attitude toward the child are tenderly com- passionate. Her features, with large, widespread eyes and a gently rounded forehead that leads into the line of the nose, are similar to those one sees in works known to be by Mazza. Draperies fall from the Madonna's shoulders and over her arms in deep folds which ac- centuate the flowing movement of this small sculpture. How Mazza's relief was intended to be used remains uncertain, but perhaps it was hung above a small private altar where it would be seen just above eye level, as it should be if one is to appreciate the subtlety of the modeling. The normally pinkish color of fired terracotta has been hidden by a surface treated to simulate pati- nated bronze, an effect which appears to be original to the piece. This appealing relief, distinguished as it is by workman- ship of a high order where every detail has been brought to the appropriate degree of finish, is a welcome addi- tion to the Museum's collection of small-scale sculpture. A wooden Shinto Goddess, Japanese, 9th century Japanese art of the Heian period, 794-1185, is particu- larly interesting since it was at this time that a truly indigenous style was being developed. The influences of T'ang China on the art, literature and politics of Japan were receding, and the assimilation of these influences was beginning to reach the entire fabric of Japanese society. Shinto was a very loosely organized religion which had been able to accept the incursion of both Confucianism and Buddhism without upset and which had adopted some of the ideas, images and ritual of these religions into its worship. One of the major adoptions was that of anthropomorphic sculpture. Most Shinto sculpture was of wood and portrayed an anonymous personage dressed in the court fashion of the period. Naturally, these figures also contained elements of Bud- dhist iconography. Buddhist art being the major art of the period and there being no conflict between the two religions themselves or between their adherents. The Museum's Shinto Goddess, though small, has, in the bold conception of its carving and in the sensitivity of line and handling of its polychrome and kirikane or cut-gold decoration, the strength and solidity one ex- pects of fine Shinto sculpture. The sensitivity of the artist is further manifest in his use, only now apparent through the loss of the painted decoration, of the beauti- fully grained hinoM wood as an integral part of the sculptural mass. A marble bust of Faith Hiram Powers, American, 1805-1873 Gift of Mr. J. Harold Pettus The wheel of fashion has turned to favor more than one 19th century American artist whose work began to be relegated to attics, cellars and museum storerooms some- where around the time of the World's Columbian Ex- position in Chicago. Modern times seemed to call for a clean sweep, but over the last 20 years the 19th century has been receiving closer scrutiny with the result that many of the artists who were ushered so hastily into oblivion have shown surprising recuperative powers. We have seen the return in full force of the Hudson River School as well as that of many other artists whose work not so long ago was either ignored or despised. As we see them from the mid-60's, these artists as a group have much to tell us about an important and extremely in- teresting period in the history of American art, while 3</page><page sequence="4">RECENT ACQUISITIONS individually they not infrequently rise to new heights. While Thomas Cole, 1801-1848, John Frederick Kensett, 1818-1872, Albert Bierstadt, 1830-1902, and Jasper Fran- cis Cropsey, 1823-1900, were noting the beauties of the White Mountains and the Rockies, native sculptors were occupied in other directions. Many went abroad for long periods of time, especially to Italy where they were close to a supply of smooth, white marble as well as to skilled Italian workmen who could help in carrying out commissions. Of all these sculptors Hiram Powers, who was born in Woodstock, Vermont in 1805, was the most significant. Like the others he, too, was guided by a taste for neo- classicism and, in his choice of themes, was often at- tracted by those having a moral tone. Through the generosity of Mr. J. Harold Pettus, the Mu- seum has recently acquired its first work by Hiram Pow- ers, a bust in white marble symbolizing Faith. The fe- male figure is shown with drapery in even folds over her shoulder. Her hair is combed back softly and her fea- tures have been reduced to a type, a characteristic of Powers' work with the exception of his portrait busts which are much more animated and individual. In terms of the Museum's collection, which is generally lacking in 19th century American sculpture, Hiram Pow- ers' bust will assume an important place in the second floor galleries where the work of 19th century American painters is on display. Etrangers de Metier, 1960 Pierre Alechinsky, Belgian, born 1927 City Art Museum has recently acquired its first painting by the Belgian artist Pierre Alechinsky as a gift from Nancy Singer. Etrangers de Metier, painted in 1960, is dominated by two large forms, a man and a woman, towering over the 4 smaller figure of a child. Using primarily a bright, deep blue to define the figures, the artist built up their forms with a solid network of yellow and white and flesh tones varying from pink to brown. Divided into two oval-topped forms, these figures are set against a deeper variation of the flesh tone to which brown and purple have been added. As a child Alechinsky, who was naturally left-handed, was forced to write with his right hand but continued to use his left for drawing. To this circumstance the artist attributes his interest in calligraphy, certainly manifest in the Museum's painting. In 1955, during a trip to Japan, Alechinsky made a film on Japanese callig- raphy. Before going to Japan, he had worked in Paris with the well-known printmaker and teacher Stanley William Hayter. Earlier, he had begun his artistic career by studying typography and etching at the School of Architecture and Decorative Arts in Brussels. With the painters G. B. Corneille, Asger Jörn and Karel Appel and writer Christian Dotremont, Alechinsky formed the Cobra group and review in 1948. Cobra was named from the first letters of the artists' native cities, Copenhagen, BRussels, Amsterdam, and was organized for the purpose of collective and experimental work. In 1960 Alechinsky, along with four other artists, was chosen to represent Belgium at the 30th Venice Biennale. Balìroom and ínbetween, 1965 Two works by Helen and Howard Jones Two works by St. Louis artists Helen and Howard Jones have come to the Museum through the generosity of Mr. Charles H. Yalem. In the last two years Howard Jones, associate professor at the School of Fine Arts, Washington University, has been working imaginatively with paint and actual light. In Inbetween, the Museum's new acquisition, the artist has constructed two panels meant to be seen side by</page><page sequence="5">side: one a narrow, blue panel with a darker, central area of glowing density; the other a square with a large, white, circular area in the center. Arranged in concentric circles over the surface of the larger panel, miniature light bulbs go on and off in a changing sequence, casting patterns of shadow on the painted background. The artist, in a mesmerizing fashion, involves the viewer actively in a fascinating visual experience that reflects one of the basic conventions in Western painting, the exploration of light and shadow. By applying mirrors, reflectors, paint and decorated papers to a wooden box equipped with a door which opens onto an ever-changing view of wooden and plastic balls and artificial fruit, Helen Jones has created a gay and intriguing object. When the door is closed, one sees a dark-yellow box with curling decorations painted in bright blue surmounted by a silver finial. In the center of each side, just above the middle, is a round mirror. Circular holes are cut from the centers of the mirrors and through the box on all sides except the back. The views through these holes vary. On the right and left, looking around a reflector applied to the exterior, one sees circular designs of decorated paper on a plane at a 45-degree angle to the opening; looking further, the viewer and the circular opening are reflected. Through the front, when the door is closed, one has fragmented views of the interior which, when the door is opened, is revealed through another window opening, this time oval and flanked by two narrower ones containing oval and round silver forms and mirrors. The box and its many-layered contents make visual plays on round and oval forms, windows and eyes. In fact, the various mirrors give the viewer's own eyes an important role. Eyes, too, are windows, ovals and circles. In addition to the associations of visual and geometric forms, the box, with its deliciously colored balls, recalls the fast-disappearing penny bubble gum machines which were once so common. 5</page><page sequence="6">Inbetween, 1965 Howard W.
