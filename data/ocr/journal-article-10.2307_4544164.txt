By A. BOYCE GIBSON. IN the second part of the Discourse on Method, Descartes tells us that the "first principles" of his scientific method must "all be borrowed from philosophy." The apprehension of ideas as clear and distinct, which produces such an intense subjective certainty, may, after all, deceive us in our quest for reality. Whether it is simply that we sometimes think ideas to be clear and distinct when, in fact, they are not, or whether, more radically, ideas may be genuinely clear and distinct and yet fail to correspond with the real, we cannot banish our doubt until we are assured that reality corroborates our reason. Accordingly, Descaites embarks on the meta- physical method of doubt, and passes through the certain existence of the thinking self to the certain existence of God. But God does not deceive: the universe we apprehend through clear and distinct ideas is, under His power, a rational universe, and in a rational universe the pronouncements of our reason hold, even at the moments when we forget them. Hence, God is said to guarantee the deliverances of science. He lifts them from the ideal to the real. They reappear in this new medium intact, without loss or modification. They are not relatively but absolutely true. But the reason they are true is that there really is a rational order in which they find a home. Taken apart from this order they are true provision- ally on its rediscovery. Science without God hangs precariously on the evidence of the inner light; and this is what Descartes means when he says that no atheist can be a geometer.* * Adam et Tannery, Wuvres, VII, 141 (Resp. Obj. II); cf. VII, 428 (Resp. Obj. VI). E</page><page sequence="2">32 A. BOYCE GIBSON. The precise character of the guarantee, however, is still to seek; and the problem which thus arises is that of the eternal verities and the will of God. By the eternal verities Descartes means the axioms and first principles of logic, mathematics and science; and he selects his examples indiscriminately from all three. In what relation must they stand to God if the guarantee is to be effective ? And in what sense are we to interpret the guarantee itself ? According to Descartes's usual mode of statement, God, being perfect, cannot deceive, and therefore when we have satisfied our own best standards, have put prejudice and passion behind us, and have attained the highest clarity of intellectual conviction, in short, if we are not ourselves through our own carelessness responsible for the deception, we are entitled to believe that our scientific conclusions are metaphysically valid. The quaint flavour of archaic piety will deceive no one who knows the depth of Descartes's feeling against anthropomor- phism.* The truthfulness of God is a pictorial version of His rationality. Descartes means that the universe of science is actually built as our reason supposes it to be built: that its central principles are those which our reason recognizes. But, further, he means that the ideal is dominated by the real, and for this very reason cannot bear false witness about the real. It is clear that we must not think of God as a kind of auto- matic sanction, or as taking the detail on trust from our reason as an over-worked business man takes it from his secretary. This would reduce reality to an otiose repetition. Once we had acknowledged it with due reverence, we might proceed to embalm it in its own sanctity and to do business with the ideal. As our standards are bound to be sanctioned in any case, the sanction is really without significance. The result, in the case before us, would be the liberation of science * cf. Interview with Burman, A.T., V, 158.</page><page sequence="3">THE ETERNAL VERITIES, ETC. 33 from its metaphysical dependence and its own erection into a metaphysic. God would be subordinated to the eternal verities. Atheists would be able to poach as they pleased on the fenced acres of geometry, secure in the conviction that their depreda- tions were authorized in advance by the keeper. But in that case, a keeper is surely a superfluous luxury. Of this preliminary error Descartes was certainly not guilty, and, indeed, it could hardly have occurred to any philosophically minded thinker in his strenuously theological age. It was, as a matter of fact, a favourite device of mediaeval controversy to allege that one's opponent had committed it, and so fallen into an absurdity. Actually, however, so eminent a mediae- valist as M. Gilson has failed to discover any authentic example of it within the limits of his own period,* and we may take it that Thomas Aquinas spoke for his whole age when he said that " we cannot suppose the Ideas to exist outside God, but in the mind of God alone.t To this orthodox view Descartes assents as a matter of course: indeed, his only objection to it is that it does not go far enough. God does not stumble upon the multiplication table, or even the law of contradiction, ready-made, as we do, and conform to their autocracy whether He will or no. As universal reason, He is their source as well as their executor. If His sanction is to be significant, it must at the same time sustain human standards in their appropriate sphere, and assert its own supremacy over them. By way of reaction, we may in return run to the opposite extreme, and regard the eternal verities as the despotic declara- tion of omnipotent and lawless will. God, we may say, creates the verities as he pleases, and could have created them other- wise if He had felt inclined. In mediaeval language, the intellect of God is a mere dependency of His will. It must * E. Gilson, La Liberte' Chez Descartes et la The'otogie, pp. 36-41. t De Veritate 3, 1. E 2</page><page sequence="4">34 A. BOYCE GIBSON. be admitted that Descartes, in this connexion, is far less careful of Charybdis than of Scylla: and therefore it is important to draw attention at once to the serious implications of the view before us. Universal reason would be subjected to the caprice of non-rational omnipotence, and the malignant demon would be back on us in real earnest. God's intellect would be com- palled to accept the multiplication table exactly as ours is. The ground of human reason will itself be unreasonable. But if it is dissatisfied with itself because of its contradictions, it will hardly find rest in a mere immensity of power which takes contradiction in its stride. On this point, Thomas Aquinas was rightly emphatic. " The will of God cannot be for things which are inherently impossible."* And, curiously enough, as far as concerns our inter- pretation of the guarantee, these two extreme positions lead to an identical and fatal conclusion. Whether the eternal verities direct God's will from the outside, or whether, on the other hand, they are its arbitrary creation, the whole notion of a guarantee is perfectly pointless. In neither case is there any distinction between the eternal verities as apprehended by man, and those same verities as they exist in the mind of God. If, on the former theory, our thoughts are raised to the status of God's, on the latter God's thoughts are reduced to the status of ours. Any appeal from one to the other will simply be judged a second time before the same tribunal. If the metaphysical guarantee is to mean anything, it must distinguish the verities as existing in God from the verities as accepted by man; and it would seem, from our analysis, as if this could only happen if they are taken as charged with the will of God in the former case, and as separated from it iIn the latter. God's will and intellect are one, but our intellectual appreciation of what He wills is directed to His intellect only. * Contra Genttiles, I, 84.</page><page sequence="5">THE ETERNAL VERITIES, ETC. 35 Between the extremes, however, there are still at least two possible courses. It is possible that the will of God, though owing no allegiance to anything outside the divine nature, is nevertheless bound to accept the verities as presented to it within His intellect. This, on the whole, is the view of Thomas Aquinas. Or, on the other hand, though God's will does not produce the eternal verities out of nothing, yet it may be instinct with intellect from the beginning, and thus carry inseparably with it when it produces them, an intellectual sanction. This, with some reservations, is the position of Descartes. But in either of these cases, though more urgently in the latter, we shall be compelled to distinguish between the eternal verities as they really are, and as they are presented to us. Our immediate object is to analyse the grounds of such a distinction. In contrasting the ways of God with the ways of man, Descartes commonly draws attention to God's incomprehen- sibility. We know that God can do the things He has done, but we do not know that He cannot do the things He has not done.* But the eternal verities are things we can understand. Further, we understand that in reality they are not self- sufficing. What passes human understanding is greater than what falls within it.t Thus, the power of which we do not know whether it is pledged to its allied intellect or not is necessarily the source of the verities in our minds. Now the incomprehensibility of God was a familiar theological doctrine, and Descartes, in using it to throw doubt on the certitude of Thomas Aquinas, could claim to be setting out, at least, from an orthodox point of view. But, all the same, it completely shelves the issue. We still do not know whether God's will does freely create the verities which form the content of His * To Mesland, A.T., IV, 118. t To Mersenne, A.T., I 150.</page><page sequence="6">36 A. BOYCE GIBSON. intellect, or whether it does not. There is, however, more in the background. In the reply to the sixth objection to the Meditations, challenged on his attribution of an infinite will to human beings, he indicates that " the essence of the div'ine will is very different from the essence of ours." " It is ouit of the question," he continues, " that the will of God should not have been from all eternity indifferent . . . to everything that should even happen: there being no idea representing goodness and truth . . . which can be supposed to have been the object of God's understanding before its nature was so constituted by the determination of His will. . . . It is because He willed that the three angles of a triangle should be equal to two right angles that this is now true, and cannot be otherwise."* The view here expressed, that God is above the eternal verities, is almost uniquet in the published work of Descartes's lifetime, and as, at first sight, it appears to be identical with one of the views which render meaningless the appeal from the lower to the higher order of reason which Descartes is par- ticularly concerned to uphold and explain, it may be wondered whether it really represents his considered outlook, or whether it is simply, as it is ostensibly, a retort to a misunderstanding of another aspect of his teaching, uncorrelated with its main body. This, however, is not the case. The unorthodoxy of the position (for, as M. Gilson remarks, the enemy here is Thomas Aquinas): is enough to account for his reluctance to make it public; and his correspondence shows, firstly, that it was his continuous conviction (it first occurs in the famous letter to Mersenne of April 15th, 1630, and re-occurs at intervals until * A.T., VII, 435. t There are approaches to it in the reply to the Fifth Objections. I La Liberte chez Descartes et la TheIologie, Ch. II (L'Adversaire de Descartes).</page><page sequence="7">THE ETERNAL VERITIES, ETC. 37 the letter to Arnauld of June 29th, 1648, within eighteen months of his death) ; and secondly, that its birth coincides with its author's discovery of a philosophical basis for his scientific method. Not only did he believe it; it was the very foundation of his philosophy. We may further elucidate it with quotations from the letters. -The metaphysical verities which you call eteinal have been established by God and entirely depend on Him, as well as His creatures in general. To say that these verities are independent of Him is, in fact, to speak of God as of some Jupiter or Saturn, and to subject him to Styx or the Fates."* " God has estab- lished these laws in nature, as a King established laws in his kingdom. He was as free not to make the radii of a circle equal, as not to create the world."t Nor do we stop with the axioms of mathematics. He was also free to " make it untrue that the three angles of a triangle should be equal to two right angles, or in general that contradictories should not exist together.":t A hasty reading of these passages might suggest that God has not only established, but can also reverse, the axioms of geometry, and even of logic, in the same way (except Descartes's analogy) as a Bourbon can issue or reverse his edicts. For all that God is a spirit, He wears the trappings of Louis XIV. What He has created freely, He can change freely. If this were really the case, specialists in logic and mathematics would be mere lawyers, struggling to interpret the uncertain will of a sovereign whose wishes, unlike the laws of the realm, are not even disclosed. But this, at least, Descartes denies. God has not necessarily willed the eternal verities, but he has willed them to be necessary.? His nature is immutable, and so * To Mersenne, A.T., I, 145-6. t Ibid, I, 152. 1 To Mesland, IV, 118. ? Ibid.</page><page sequence="8">38 A. BOYCE GIBSON. therefore, is the expression of His will. His irresponsibility is bounded by the eternally active perfection which cannot change without losing its character and passing into the sphere of potentiality and imperfection. But, it will be replied, thus chained to rns perfection, God's will is not omnipotent. Either the foundations of logic and the sciences are exposed to perpetual interference, or else, in His continuity of purpose at least, God follows the pre-existing form of His own essence. There appears to be an irreconcileable cleavage between omnipotence and perfection. Omnipotence is only omnipotence if it can change perfection: and perfection is only perfection if it can resist omnipotence. Omnipotence demands that everything shall be contingent save arbitrary power: perfection demands that nothing should be contingent, but everything harmoniously ordered. But, as Descartes points out, the dilemma is stated in terms of human experience, and as applied to God, involves anthropomorphism. Omni- potence and perfection in God may appear to us as standing in irreducible antagonism, but their reconciliation in God himself may be simple and obvious. Our reason may be unable to follow the connexion of His attributes, but it does not follow that they are not connected. Therefore, in the nature of God it may be well that the contradiction which we detect in it may be transmuted into the very stuff of perfect harmony. This conclusion is supported by the paradoxical reflection that if omnipotence and peifection appear to us in a necessary antagonism, they also appear as essential complementaries. Power divorced from perfection denies itself as well as per- fection: perfection divorced from power denies itself as well as power. Omnipotence implies immutability, and immut- ability omnipotence. If God were mere indiscriminate power, He would be capable of lying and of destroying His own nature. This is impossible, and if it were possible, it would involve a</page><page sequence="9">THE ETERNAL VERITIES, ETC. 39 descent into contingence by which power would, of necessity, be restricted. And if God's perfection were not allied with omni- potence, God would be confronted with that which He cannot wholly control, thus forfeiting not only power but perfection. If the antagonism is not transcended, the antagonists are merely shadows. Conversely, however, if there is no antagon- ism, the transcendence is merely a shadow, for human reason would not need to pass beyond itself to solve its problems. It would appear, then, firstly that the contradiction, on the plane of our thinking, is a genuine one; secondly, that it is only one thesis of an antinomy, and the other is equally genuine; and thirdly, that in God, beyond the finite manipula- tion of our fragmentary concepts, the contradictory and complementary characters of omnipotence and perfection are genuinely reconciled. This, however, is to anticipate. So far we have seen that the decrees of God are at least irrevocable, and in this sense, at least, with Descartes's own consent, we may limit the scope of omnipotence. We are now assured that the mathematician, for example, can rely on his charter: that the divine diplomacy knows no " scraps of paper." Have we here, then, the synthesis for which we are seeking ? Are we to acknowledge that God might have made 4 by 2 equal to 13, but as He has onice made them equal to 8, they must remain so for ever and ever ? Or, to be yet more awkward, might it have happened that God should have decreed the co-existence of contra- dictories, though, not having done so, he cannot now reverse His decision ? This would indubitably appear, from the passages quoted above, to be Descartes's meaning. But this is not a synthesis: it is only a compromise: and like all patch- work settlements, it divides the territory, leaving both claims unsatisfied and a host of minority problems to disentangle. For if God's original whim could have made 4 by 2 equal to</page><page sequence="10">40 A. BOYCE GIBSON. something other than 8, then, until He made His momentous decision, His will was supreme over His intellect; and if thence- forward 4 by 2 equals 8, no matter what the mitigating cir- cumstances may be, we have an absolute priority of His intellect over His will. The division is as cataclysmic and as indefensible as the Marxian bisection of history, and is quite irreconcileable with the Cartesian dogma of God's absolute unity. On the one hand, there might have been nothing in the universe but hopeless confusion. God might haye done, with full power to enforce, what the mathematical anarchists of the Indiana legislature very nearly did in 1899, and passed a law decreeing that v should equal 4 instead of 3- 14159.* That way madness lies, and although, mercifully enough, it never happened, the guarantee of a power under whom it might have happened is not sufficient to reassure us when we question our own rational standards. On the other hand, once the fiat has gone forth, it holds irrespectively of all modifying condi- tions; in the mind of God as in the mind of man, and in the same sense. In the work of creation, God has shot his bolt. Thenceforward His whole mind and will is pledged to the standard he has established for humanity. To appeal for a guarantee to such an authority is at the same time superfluous and unsatisfying, for in so far as we appeal to Him as standard we appeal simply to a duplicate of ourselves, and in so far as we look beyond the standard we find nothing but arbitrary power. To effect the synthesis, then, we must be able to justify both the supremacy of God over the eternal verities, and His realization through them. The principle of the solution is * See " The War on Modern Science: a short history of the Ftinda- mentalist attack on Evolution and Modernism," by Maynard Shipley, President of the Science League of America. Quoted in The Times Literary Supplement, Sept. 1st, 1927.</page><page sequence="11">THE ETERNAL VERITIES, ETC. 41 stated by Emile Boutroux, when he distinguishes between absolute and relative contradiction. (In his Latin thesis of 1874, De veritatibus aeternalibus apud Cartesium.) The essence of Boutroux's contention is that the only absolute con- tradiction is that between absolute and relative, between perfect and imperfect. All other contradiction is susceptible of a possible dissipation in the absolute. Now we have already noticed, in connexion with the suggested reversibility of God's decisions, that there is an absolute contradiction between the nature of God and the attribute of change. This God himself cannot overcome. Now the eternal verities which are delivered to us as authoritative, though originally embedded in God's nature, do not, taken by themselves, express that nature in its fulness. They embody the imperfect in its absolute contra- liction with the perfect. But the imperfect necessarily stands to the perfect as inferior to superior, and when the imperfect has been derived from the perfect by the exclusion from the perfect of its property of power, it is through the concept of power that the absoluteness of the contradiction will best be conveyed. On the other hand, taken in the full divine context, the verities, being inseparable from God's will, are co-equal with it. For in God the relative contradiction of abstract intellect and abstract power is ultimately resolved, and the two attributes are completely fused in a single current of self- substantiation. To approach the matter in this way we must make two important assumptions; firstly, that the eternal verities have their source in the intellect of God, and secondly, that God is absolute unity. On both these points Descartes is perfectly satisfied. As God is omniscient, He must be thought as well as will, and if the verities have their source in Him at all they must be sifted through His mind. And in any case, the notion of archetypal Ideas as present in the mind of God was</page><page sequence="12">4i2 A. BOYCE GIBSON. strongly entrenched in Descartes's time, and not least in the neo-platonist circles by which Descartes was so profoundly influenced. Further, Descartes insists emphatically that God is single, and that there is no division in Him: thus adopting the stricter view of His fundamental unity. And with theses positions behind him, he is free to advance and solve his problem. It is a commonplace with Descartes that terms cannot be applied univocally, or in the same sense, to God and to man. Indeed, one of the chief recommendations in his eyes of his theory of God's supremacy over the eternal verities is that it will introduce a worthier conception of God, and he implies that once men cease to think of him, " like the vulgar," " as something finite,"* they will abate their opposition. Now the conceptual distinction in God between intellect and will is a human device, built up on human analogies. In us they can be discriminated and considered apart, for we are not, like God, a perpetual realization. Our thoughts are only potentially active; but in God thought and activity are continuously identical. Thus it is that " we should not conceive any prefer- ence or priority between the intellect and the will of God."t This makes it clear that the verities, as they exist in the mind of God, cannot, and never could have been, annulled by His power. But all creation is a species of determination, and what in the increate is indivisible is none the less divisible in the created. Now the verities are an aspect of the intellect of God adapted to the limitations of the finite intellect, and as such they no longer carry the full co-operation of the Divine Being from which they are derived. Thus, when they are traced back to their origin and placed in contrast with it, they appear before it as something external and passive. Further, the aspect * To Mersenne, A.T., I, 150. t To Mesland, A.T., IV, 118.</page><page sequence="13">THE ETERNAL VERITIES, ETC. 43 of God's being which this abstraction most obviously ignores is His will or power. We are thus tempted to return on this aspect which we have ignored, and, without reuniting it with the verities which have been separated from it by their descent into the finite, to set it up in contrast with them, and thus to make the verities absolutely dependent on God's solitary power. This is in effect to assume that God, in creating the verities, actually divested Himself of His intellect (to the extent, at any rate, that the verities constitute it), so that they cannot exist simultaneously both as creations and as an aspect of the Creator. This, however, would be to falsify the whole character of creation; for God cannot discard His attributes, as if they could be exhausted by their exercise. Amnid the bustle of His creative activity, He remains immutable. We may, if we please, regard the verities, taken alone, as absolutely subordinate to the complete nature of God which includes them; but in that case His omnipotence is fused with, and regulated by, His pervasive intellect. We may now apply Boutroux's formula. Absolute contra- diction, we may recall, can prevail only between two disparate orders of being, the perfect and the less than perfect ; and such a form of contradiction involves the absolute subordination of the less than perfect to the perfect. Now, between the two finite conceptions of God's dissected attributes there is a relative contradiction, but between the totality of God and any partial aspect of Him there is an absolute contradiction. But absolute omnipotence and absolute perfection taken singly are two partial human views, which, though irreconcilable as long as their separateness is posited, are, in fact, never actually separate. Thus the absolute subordination which attaches to absolute contradiction may be enforced on the verities in relation to the whole and perfect nature of God, but not in relation to His abstract power.</page><page sequence="14">44 A. BOYCE GIBSON. God's intellect, then, as such, cannot be subordinated tlo His will, any more than His will can be subordinated to His intellect; and this on principles on which Descartes habitually relied, even when he does not acknowledge them. But can this conclusion be reconciled with his own explicit statements ? Apply it to the example he gives in the reply to the Sixth Objections, 4 by 2 equals 8. According to the theory just put forward God does not indeed first consult the multiplication table, and then pass on its formula, 4 by 2 equals 8, with his seal and 'sanction. But neither does He say, in vacuo, let 4 by 2 equal 8, and fetter His intellect to the mere proclamation. Rather the proclamation and its rationality are simultaneous, both in time and in eternity. But in that case it is not true that 4 by 2 could ever not have equalled 8; which is a direct denial of Descartes's very words, This is almost certainly due to his failure to grasp the distinction, implicit in his position, which we have tried to formulate. This, at any rate, is what the jump in, the following deduction would seem to indicate. Writing to Mersenne, in 1630 Descartes anticipates his famous statement to Mesland, saying, " In God it is only one thing to will and to know." " So that," he proceeds inconsequently, "from the very fact that He wishes anything, He therefore knows it: and therefore only is such a thing true."* Simul- taneity is explained away into priority. Now it is one thing to say that the verities, taken apart from God's will, are abstract and therefore dependent; and another to say that they are the dependent element in the concrete fusion of intellect and will in God. Therefore, though it may be true that God's plans are not prior to His volitions, it is not true that He could have made others; at least, not if Descartes is right in saying that His intellect and His will are one. Doubtless He was free not to create man, or the verities, at all; this is a mediaeval com- * To Mersenne, A.T.. I, 149.</page><page sequence="15">THE ETERNAL VERITIES, ETC. 45 monplace which Descartes accepts without hesitation.* But He was not free to create irrationally, for His will and His reason are one. The easy and fatal transition in the passage before us shows that Descartes was by no means clear in his intentions. On his own showing, he has either used a legitimate argument and, by false reasoning, reached an illegitimate conclusion, or he has made an illegitimate assumption and bolstered it up by a legiti- mate but irrelevant argument. He knew that the eternal verities could not be guaranteed by a duplicate of themselves; he kniew also that their reference beyond themselves involves their being caught up in God's power. He was further fully aware that in God will and intellect are one. He has clearly discerned the premises: only he hesitates to draw the con- *clusion. The reason is that he misinterprets the power to which the verities are referred as pure power, whereas this is an illusion arising from a confusion of relative with absolute contradiction. The verities, as we know them, are indeed dependent, but on the inseparable power and intellect of God. It is important to note that this conclusion does not threaten Descartes's statement that the verities are freely created ; that is admitted, and indeed emphasized. The real problem, as Mersenne saw, is the manner of their creation. Descartes's reply to his inquiry is that God has created the -eternal verities in the same way as He has created everything else: niamely, as their " total and efficient cause."t Now this is ambiguous ; for though all existences are created by God's proclamation, some, namely the material, are alien to SGod's own nature, for God, being spirit, can have no body; -while others, the spiritual centres of finite thought, are as * Resp. Obj., VI, A.T., VII, 431-2 ; cf. VII, 435. t A.T., I, 151.</page><page sequence="16">46 A. BOYCE GIBSON. spirit akin to Him, though they stand to Him as finite to infinite. The production of the former, therefore, must constitute a veritable creation out of nothing, while the latter is drawn by limitation from the inner nature of God himself. Now we are told the laws of nature are God's impression of Himself upon the physical world; and the same must be true, a Jortiori, of the primary assumption of mathematics and logic. Thus the eternal verities, in all kinds, are not creations out of nothing, but special determinations of God's mind. As special determinations they may indeed resemble material creation as a whole; and they might never have been created. But as contents of God's mind, unlike material creation, they- exist eternally and by necessity. They are thus not only irreversible, but could never have been other than they are, if they were to be at all. They are, in fact, as material creation is not, formally contained in God. Thus, free creation does not mean abstract omnipotence; the appeal to the guarantee of God meets with a response which is at once rational, yet more than the human reason which appeals to it. This is so obviously what Descartes wants that he ought to have abandoned, as an extravagant excrescence, the doctrine that the verities might have been otherwise. It is enough for his purpose that they should be conditional and dependent on the rational power of God. Such, in outline, is Descartes's doctrine. It remains to, affiliate it to the rest of his philosophy. It is not too much to say that the doctrine of God and the eternal verities is the pivot of the whole Cartesian system. The rise of mechanical science and the theology of personal redemption threatened, on either side, the mediaeval synthesis^ of scientific and religious values. Descartes was a working: adherent of the new science, and through the Augustinian coterie of the Oratory profoundly influenced by the new theo-</page><page sequence="17">THE ETERNAL VERITIES, ETC. 47 logy; and it was his business, as a philosopher, to try to see the new situation as a whole. This was all the more difficult, as under the new dispensation science appeared to have no need of religion, nor religion of science. The eternal verities are the last word of science; God is the last word of religion. How are they related to one another ? Clearly the partner- ship must be more flexible than that recognized by the Middle Ages. Cosmology must be clear of religion, and religion of cosmology; yet somehow they must be reconciled in a single system. The negative condition of the new synthesis is satis- fied by the mutual exclusiveness of extension and spirit; but this in itself is mere dualism, and under cover of explanation shirks explaining. Their independence of each other must be transcended and safeguarded by a single reality wide enough to include both of them. Now this reality cannot be approached through the interpretation of extension, for we have seen that it may always be called in doubt on the ground that it depends on our private assurance. Unless the approach from the side of spirit can be more securely grounded, we shall be doomed to remain for ever wanderers in the world of opinion and darkness. Thus, the subordination of science to a metaphysic of the spirit, if such can be constructed, is one pillar of the Cartesian system. The self-evidence of explanatory axioms does not satisfy us; not because the axioms are not true, but because their truth will hold only if reality is rational. They have rallied round them a compact and coherent intellectual system, within which there exists a mutual implication of necessary connexion. If this can be guaranteed at all, it will be guaranteed as a whole, without internal dislocation; and here, we may note in passing, we have the second pillar of the Cartesian system: the integrity of scientific interpretations provided the guarantee is forthcoming. But at no point can this system claim an immediate identity with the real. For this we must pass F</page><page sequence="18">48 A. BOYCE GIBSON. to the intuition of the thinking self, and with the discovery within it of the desired identity we pass from science to meta- physics. The whole order of the Discourse shows that the two types of intuition are not of the same kind. We are not sure of the verities till we discover their analogy to the thinking self, of which we are sure. This is because the latter intuition is already definitely metaphysical in character. It is an imme- diate revelation of the immediate identity, in one aspect of experience, of the ideal and the real. We need not stop to consider Descartes's apparent carelessness in making clarity and distinctness a criterion of absolute truth on the basis of his unsupported analogy ; for the intuition, " cogito ergo sum (mistakenly rendered as a syllogism) is discovered to be incom- plete without reference to the existence of God. It is a detached fragment of the true reality, whereas extension interpreted under the verities is an organized system which is still hypo- thetical. They thus demand God in different ways and for different reasons: the one for completion, the other for recog- nition. It is for this reason that it is possible to argue for the existence of God from the former only; it cannot be conceived except as referring beyond itself. The verities, on the other hand, may affirm themselves ideally, even if reality is a chaos or a figment, and it is this very fact which makes it impossible to proceed directly from them to reality. Given a foothold in the real, reason may proceed to claim that if it is rational at all, it must be wholly zational, and thus rescue for reality the rational systems which have been constructed without this assurance. Reason demands that where it is incomplete it shall be transcended. The systeins of scientific knowledge, however, are not incomplete: they are perfectly co-ordinated and homogeneous. They lack not consistency, but reality: a distinction which a modern idealist may ridicule, but which for</page><page sequence="19">THE ETERNAL VERITIES, ETC. 49 Descartes is absolutely vital. For his division of experience into two disparate sections implies that within either of them we may construct a complete system of knowledge which the other cannot modify, even though it is required to sustain it. The difference between metaphysical and logical intuitions is one which Descartes, it is true, does not fully recognize :* but the whole development of his philosophy hangs upon it. Thus the cogito is not " guaranteed " in the same sense as the verities, and metaphysical truth is developed upon an independent basis. Indeed, it may be argued with some plausibility that Descartes developed, over and above the atomistic logic of clear and distinct ideas, a metaphysical logic of implication, which is at work wherever, as in the case of thinking beings, His creatures look to Him as their form or end. On such a logic the proofs of the existence of God depend, for the intuition of the self is certainly not " distinct " in the sense of having no ragged edges. It fades off into the divine nature on which it depends. It may be noted in passing that this meets at least one of the objections urged against Descartes's philosophy on the score of circularity. It is not the kinid of logic which demands a guarantee that is employed in the proofs of God's existence. This discovery in its turn throws fresh light on the subordina- tion of the eternal verities to God. What strains our credulity furthest in this theory is the statement that God is above the law of contradiction ; for it would seem that this is not the peculiar assumption of science, but a necessity of all thinking whatever. We nlow realize, however, that the law of contra- diction deals with relatives, and is absolutely true only from al partial viewpoint. In the fuller context of God their opposition is softened into distinction. Nor can it be rediscovered in * He even describes the verities as " metaphysical." of.

God, as spirit, is in man, though, as infinite, He is above man. Within the inmost being of God, then, the law of contradiction, does not hold: not because it is wholly untrue, but because it is transcended. This inter- pretation, it is true, is irreconcilable with the view that the verities could have been otherwise; but we have seen that this is an exaggerated statement of Descartes's genuine view, which simply asserts that the verities could not be what they are without God. But the doctrine of a double logic carries us yet further. Not merely is the logic of pure contradiction, of the absolute truth or falsehood of particular propositions, subordinate to the complete context of God: it is subordinate to a metaphysical logic of implication. On the plane where reason and realitv are one there is really no absolute opposition. We do not leap from one pinnacle of truth to another: we work our way upwards and outwards from the more limited truth to the fuiller. And it is because we can argue in this way from our immediate experience that we can justify to ourselves the original intuitions of abstract science and abstract logic. These do not belong, as such, to realitv; but when we know that reality is rational we realize that, under certain limitations, they are in fact, true. We justify our scientific method by the conclusions of our metaphysical method. Never, indeed, has the spectre of " the scientific method in philosoplhy " beeni so relentlessly exposed to the light of day. It might be expected, however, that the compact body of scientific truth would be relegated, under this dispensation, to the status of appearance. And this is just what does not happen. God guarantees scientific knowledge as it stands: it is lifted bodily into the structure of reality. It is not partially true; it is wholly but conditionally true. Though it cannot</page><page sequence="21">THE MTERNAL VERITIES, ETC. 51 be judged by its own tribunal, it is completely justified when it appears before a higher. Not only that, within its own domain, its tribunal is absolute, and there is no appeal. It resembles the continental variety of feudal lord, whose vassals swore allegiance to him alone, while he swore allegiance to the sovereign. God has no direct teleological relation with material phenomena. They cannot be regarded as expressing His purposes in any way whatever. They are mechanical and nothing more. This view, of course, embodies Descartes's famous rejection of final causes. The great philosophical obstacle to the accept- ance of the new science was the recognition of " essences " or "ends " in nature, which seemed to render it completely explicable in terms of qualities or the divine will. There is, perhaps, no reason why we should not inquire at the same time both how things happen and why things happen; but when the answer to the second is accepted as an adequate answer to the first, there is a temptation to those initerested in science to thrust the philosophic intruder altogether out of doors. It was in this spirit that Descartes set out " to abolish final causes from the universe " ;* and this his absolute distinction between extension and spirit enabled him to effect, at least if the term "universe"' means, as was probably intended, the sphere of extension. But what immediately concerns us here is that the rejection of final causes is intimately bound up with his theory of the eternal verities. If God's intellect is prior to His will, then the verities are among His purposes: thev exist in His mind in the very shape in which they appear to us. They will be formally ascribed to Him, and " God's purpose" will be a sufficient answer to any question of natural science. Research into mechanical causation will be interdicted. Not only on the extreme view that His will makes things true for Him, but * Princ., I, 28, cf. A.T., IT, 158.</page><page sequence="22">52 A. BOYCE G1f3SOX. even on the more moderate and acceptable view that His will and His intellect are one, there can be no known end of God's activity. The end is, in fact, one with the activity, and we cannot discerii it without reproducing in ourselves the unity which exists in God; and this, in finite beings, is impossible. It is not exactly (as M. Gilson contends),* that God has no ends, nor yet (as M. Chevalier urges)t that He really has ends, which to us are incomprehensible. There is, in a sense, a finality in God, but it is not, like the pursuit of human ends, bisected into object and striving, but is rather their indivisible expression in a single movement of His indivisible nature. But in any case, His ends are hidden, in His infinite com- plexitv ; wve cannot disentangle them and use them as forms of explanatioin for material events. Despairing of discovering their meaning, we turn to the intuitions which give us the facts ; and our interpretation will proceed, along, the familiar mechanistic lines, by analysis and synthesis of inituitional elements. Thus, paradoxically enough, by its submission, science winis complete independence. As long as its axioms are re- garded as pre-existing in God's mind and compelling His con- formity, the element of purpose in them will tend to submerge their mechanical connexions. In so far as. they are mere creations of God's complete nature, or an aspect of His intellect disconitinuously transmitted to an inferior order of being, we shall not be tempted to ignore our duty of their analysis in- otur search for the end which they conlceal. Now that science has shuffled off its claim to philosophical validity, it cani legiti- mately shuffle off the philosopher. The finalism which still lurks in the physical world is definitely innocuous: it is simply the overflow of God into nature, in which nature receives her * La Liberte chez Descartes et la ThJologie, p. 93. t Descartes, p. 308, note.</page><page sequence="23">THE ETERNAL VERITIES, ETC. 53 charter of freedom. God may be, as Descartes suggests to Chanut, " the only final cause,"* but finalism taken thus in bulk is useless for purposes of explanation in detail, and, as a matter of fact, it does not stand in opposition to mechanism, but accepts it and adopts it as its appropriate vehicle of expression among material phenomena. We conclude, then, that the positive achievement of science is altogether independent of metaphysics; that nevertheless it cannot claim to be true of reality unless it is incorporated into a metaphysical system, of which the dominating motive is spiritual; that its incorporation involves no internal changes in its structure, extension being in itself completely intelligible anid that its methods cainnot legitimately le exten(led beyond the realm of clear and distinct ideas to which they are appropriate. We suggest, further, that clear and distinct conception is proper to the sphere of extension alone, and that its applicationi to the sphere of spirit is contrary to Descartes's actual practice. The verities are the first principles of thinking in dealing with things discrete and the measurable; and these, though forming a self-contained universe, are one aspect of reality only, and at that the aspect furthest removed from God. They reveal to us the mechanical forms of His creation, through the appre- hension of the natural law with which God has signed them in token of His workmanship. But beyond the realm of nature stands the supreme reality of spirit, in which all forms of thinking devised for the interpretation of nature are shown to be inade- quate, because it is not essentially discrete, and not susceptible of mensuration. Of the first principles of mathematical physics this is sufficiently obvious; but, oni our showing, it is true of logic as well. An axiom is, in fact, clear and distinct: it is apparently intelligible in itself, though it may be viewed in the same conspectus with other axioms, and with the body of fact * To Chanut, A. T., V, 53-54.</page><page sequence="24">54 A. BOYCE GIBSON. which it helps to interpret. But the apprehension of the self, for example, involves from the beginning a reference beyond it, and the very notion of its self-dependence is self-contradictory. And still less are the thoughts of God, in Whom all is perfect inity, divisible into separate pin-points of intuition. The intuition of God is continuous and conspective; His every particular vision is tinged with universality. But as long as we are thinking of the material world, in its essential separation from the spiritual, without reference to its ultimate spiritual cause: as long as we review it, so to speak, sub specie creationis, instead of retracing it and subordinating it to its origin; as long, in fact, as we observe the actual state of things and make no inquiries about grounds or potentialities, the verities are absolute, and scientific method is supreme. This double conclusion, which gives us Descartes's answer to the question, pressing then as now, of the relation between religion and science, is based entirely on the doctrine of God and the eternal verities. The identity of will and intellect in God; the impossibility of separating end from activity in the nature of God Himself; the creation of the verities, in the abstract form in which we hail them, by the delimitation of God's intellect to match the discreteness of created things; this is the centre and inspiration of the doctrine which leaves the achievement of science intact and yet subordinates it to transcendent claims of a reality whose essence is spirit: the doctrine which is in turn the centre and inspiration of the philosophy of Descartes.</page></plain_text>
