<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eagles of North America.-Candace Savage. 1987. Ashland, Wisconsin, NorthWord, Inc. 127 pp., un- numbered figures. ISBN 0-942802-76-4. $19.95.-There are two "eagles of North America." Or, more pre- cisely, two that breed. There are 11 pages of large- type text that gives a feeling for eagles in general, and these two species in particular. The core of the book is about 100 pages of photographs. Many of them are excellent, some are outstanding. Unfortu- nately, only the photos on the dust cover are credited. Images of the Bald Eagle outnumber those of the Golden better than 3:2. There is some sound information in the text, but the figure captions tend to be anthropomorphic. This reflects the attempt to popularize the subject. The volume would be appropriate for public libraries and local nature centers.-A.H.B. DATE OF ISSUE (Vol. 105, No. 3): 10 August 1988</page></plain_text>
