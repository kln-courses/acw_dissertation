<plain_text><page sequence="1">RAYMOND J. DEVETTERRE WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS AND HEIDEGGER'S CRITIQUE For the past several centuries one attack after another has been mounted against the "first philosophy" of Western thought, metaphysics. Although many of these critiques have never been satisfactorily neutral ized, metaphysics continues to develop innovative forms, a sure sign of vitality. Both the challenges and the challenged are very much alive, a curious fact which can be explained in part by the frequent failure of advocates and critics of metaphysics to confront one another. In such a situation, therefore, it may be instructive to look at Whitehead's metaphysics in the light of Heidegger's attempted overcom ing of all possible metaphysics. Proponents of process metaphysics are convinced that their metaphysics, in the words of Norman Pittenger, is "not so vulnerable to attack as the essentialist, substantialist, or idealistic metaphysics of other thinkers."1 Proponents of Heidegger's overcoming of metaphysics are just as convinced that every metaphysics is inherently nihilistic unless transcended by a more fundamental kind of thinking. At issue is the relevance of Heidegger's critique for the metaphysics of Whitehead. Since Heidegger never considered process metaphysics in any of his published works, our task consists in outlining this critique and then evaluating Whitehead's metaphysics in light of it. If the critique is radical enough to challenge the innovative metaphysics of Whitehead, it will present a serious challenge to advocates of process thought. If, on the other hand, process metaphysics is sufficiently original to escape the Heideggerian critique, its claim to validity will be enhanced and Heideg ger's appeal for the overcoming of all metaphysics becomes questionable, no matter how cogent his arguments against traditional metaphysics might be. Heidegger's critique of metaphysics arises from his conviction that metaphysical thinking fails to think what he calls "Being." The meaning of Being, the truth of Being, is therefore lost. Raymond J. Devetterre is Professor of Philosophy at Emmanuel College, Boston, and has published widely in such journals as International Philosophical Quarterly, Philosophy Today, Man and World, Theological Studies, and The New Scholasticism. RAYMOND J. DEVETTERRE 309</page><page sequence="2">What is this "Being" written with upper case B? Nothing less than the central topic of Heidegger's thought. Unfortunately those of us who read or read about Heidegger in English face difficulties with this word "Be ing" that arise due to grammatical differences between Greek and Ger man on the one hand, and English on the other. In all three languages both infinitives and participles can be used as nouns; in Greek and German, however, infinitival substantives are clearly distinguished from the participial substantives. In English one form, the gerund, is usually used for both. The infinitival substantives for the verb "to be" in Greek and German are einai and Sein, and the participial substantives are on and Seiendes. In English we use only the gerund "being" for the substantive and hence lose the difference between infinitives used as nouns and participles used as nouns. This loss is important because it is Heidegger's claim that metaphysics has thought the infinitival only in terms of the participial and never as such; that is, metaphysics has thought the einai or Sein only in terms of on (hence "ontology") or Seiendes and never as such. The meaning of einai or Sein has therefore been forgotten. All this is difficult to say in English because we use only one form, the gerund, for substantives. Most translators and commentators try to be helpful by writing the gerund being with an upper case Β when it refers to das Sein and in lower case when it refers to das Seiende. Heidegger's Critique of Metaphysics Heidegger tells us it all began with his reading of Brentano's On the Several Senses of Being in Aristotle. (The writing of this title in English is a good example of the confusions surrounding the word "being." Because it is a major word in the title, it should be written in English with the upper case B, but because it translates the German word Seienden it should be written with the lower case b to distinguish it from translations of Sein.) The different meanings of being provoked Heidegger to wonder about the meaning of Being itself. Of course, Aristotle had thought about the meaning of Being. Indeed, what makes a metaphysician is that he moves beyond (meta) the beings of nature (phusis) to think the Being of these beings. Although Aristotle had certainly done this, neither his thinking, nor that of the entire tradition, had ever thought Being itself, Being as such, Being as Being. Being was thought only in terms of being, as the Being of beings. To think Being as the Being of beings is to think Being in terms of what is plural and diverse. As there are many different kinds of beings, there will be many different meanings of Being. The several senses of being in Aristotle all too easily expand into the many meanings of the tradition, and the meaning of Being itself gets covered over and forgotten. Heidegger believed that this forgetfulness is the major source of the current malaise in Western thought and culture. If metaphysics is the thought that thinks Being always as the Being of being, then to think Being itself is to think beyond all metaphysics to that 310 CROSS CURRENTS I FALL 1980</page><page sequence="3">which gives rise to the different metaphysical traditions. This thinking can never occur as long as metaphysics is taken as the primordial thinking, as first philosophy. Metaphysics must be overcome if Being as such is to be thought. This overcoming of metaphysics is not to be thought as a destruction in the usual sense of the word. What is intended by Heidegger is a movement of thought whereby the structure (con-struction) put together in the various metaphysical systems of the tradition is dismantled (de-struction) to expose what has been concealed by the structure. The overcoming is an escape from the confines of metaphysical thinking so that Being itself can be thought and the essential nature of the metaphysical enterprise be described. According to Heidegger the thinking that came to be known as metaphysics is defined by three essential characteristics that emerged during the Presocratic, Platonic and Aristotelian phases of its develop ment. The three crucial characteristics are: 1) the distinction between essence and existence; 2) the distinction between the really real and the apparently real — that is, the differentiation of reality and appearance; and 3) the domination of thought by a logic built on the principle of sufficient reason. In addition to these three defining characteristics West ern metaphysics has almost always, but not necessarily, developed the really real-apparently real distinction into two further refinements: a) the bifurcation of the sensible and the super-sensible, and b) the divinization of the supreme supersensible being into an absolute under whose aegis all other beings are subsumed in a unity. Metaphysics and the essence-existence distinction Although Presocratic philosophers began by thinking Being, they soon lost sight of its uniqueness. A fragment from Parmenides shows this clearly. Fragment 6 of his poem reads esti gar einai, "for Being is." Because "is" is properly predicated of beings, the saying "for Being is" leads to a conflation of Being and beings. Being itself collapses into being when it is thought in such a way that "is" can be predicated of it. "Being cannot be. Were it to be it would no longer remain Being but would become an existent being."2 The predication of esti to einai, of ist to Sein, of "is" to Being, suggests Being could be thought as being. The thinking of einai or Being in terms of onta or beings is what Heidegger terms ontology. It is a way of thinking that hides the truth of Being, and it all began with the misleading predication of "is" to Being in Parmenides's fragment. "In this utterance the original mystery of all thought is concealed . . . The estin gar einai of Parmenides has as yet been given no thought. From this we can realize the state of progress in philosophy."3 Thinking, once displaced to the ontic level of on (being), immediately encounters a peculiar situation. The word being in Greek (on) and in German (Seiendes, das Seiende) is a participle and manifests the fundamen RAYMOND J. DEVETTERRE 311</page><page sequence="4">tal ambiguity of participles in these languages for it "participates" in both the nounal and verbal senses. As a noun it designates something which is present and as verb it designates the presence of that which is present. In time what is present became conceptualized as essence and the presence of what is present became conceptualized as existence. The primary structure of metaphysics is now established. It is a thinking that, forgetting the difference between Being and beings, cannot think Being as such but only as the Being of beings. It thus becomes involved in the inevitable ambiguity of the participle on in its two senses — what a being is and that it is, essence and existence. "Being is divided into whatness and thatness. The history of metaphysics begins with this dis tinction and its preparation."4 The Greek participles on and onta are significant not only because they manifest both verbal and nounal senses at the same time but also because they are present participles. The thought which thinks in terms of them is a thought which thinks in terms of the present. When the past or future is thought, they are also thought in terms of the present, of a present that no longer is or a present that is not yet. Time is thus conceived as a series of discrete now points, the actual now point of the present, the expired ones of the past and the anticipated ones of the future. This conception of time is a distortion of its true nature, since only one of its moments, the present, is thought. Time is more than this. It is the interplay of past, present and future, an interplay so important that Heidegger suggests time be thought as four-dimensional: past, present, future, and the interplay which supports them yet holds them apart as distinct dimensions of a primordial unity. The thinking that thinks in terms of the present participles on and onta never achieves these dimen sions; it forgets time as well as Being, Zeit as well as Sein. Heidegger's thinking is an attempt to overcome this forgetfulness, as the titles of his major work of 1927, Sein und Zeit, and of his important essay of 1962, "Zeit und Sein," indicate. The thinking that thinks in terms of the present participle of the verb to be is thinking that thinks in terms of essence and existence, forgetting Being and time. It is ontological thinking, the begin ning of metaphysical thinking. Metaphysics and the reality-appearance distinction The essence-existence distinction developed into the distinction be tween the really real and the apparently real with Plato. The Forms or Ideas comprised the realm of the really real and were contrasted with the worldly entities that comprised the realm of appearance. Essences thought as Ideas were considered the really real while the existing beings of this spatio-temporal world were considered only apparently real. In the reversal of Platonic thought inaugurated by existentialism it is the existen tial world that is the really real and the essential ideal is considered mere appearance and even illusion. 312 CROSS CURRENTS / FALL 1980</page><page sequence="5">It is important to note that the presentation of the reality-appearance distinction in terms of a supersensible-sensible duality, while a frequent development in the tradition from Plato through the nineteenth century, is not a necessary component of metaphysical thinking. This duality indicates metaphysics; its absence does not entail the contrary. The crucial factor remains the reality-appearance distinction. "Metaphysical thinking rests on the distinction between that which truly is, and that which by comparison does not constitute true being. But what is decisive for the essence of metaphysics does not lie by any means in the fact that this distinction appears as an opposition between the supersensible and the sensible."5 The reality-appearance distinction is also the source of a second wide spread development of metaphysics: the divinization of what is the most really real and the unification of everything else as subordinate to it. This tends to occur because once the realms of appearance and reality are separated, there is a need to think the relation between them. For Plato this relation was that of model to copy where the copy participates in the reality of the model. The model Ideas themselves are in turn subordi nated to the highest Idea, the Good. From here it is only a short step to divinize the Good and thereby move into a theological mode of metaphys ical thinking. Because this "idea" is in such a way the first cause for everything, it is also "the idea" which is called "the Good." This highest and primary first cause is called the divine by that idea which as the Idea of all ideas remains the first cause for Plato, corresponding to Aristotle's to theion (the divine). Since the exposition of Being as idea, thinking about Being of beings has become metaphysical, and metaphysics has become theological. Theology means here the exposition of the "first cause" of beings as God and the misplacing of Being into the first cause, which contains Being in itself and discharges it from itself because it is the most being of beings.6 Aristotle sharpened the divinizing tendency of Greek metaphysics by his definition in the Metaphysics of first philosophy as the thinking that thinks on he on, ens qua ens, being as being. This meant beings are to be thought in two ways: first, according to "their most universal traits," and secondly, "as a whole." The unification of beings into a whole is accom plished by uniting all beings under a highest being. Hence first philosophy is both an ontology that reveals the generic traits of all beings and a theology that reveals their unity under a highest being. "To those who can read, this means: metaphysics is onto-theo-logy."7 What Plato began has now come to fruition. Ontology and theology are inextricably linked in first philosophy or metaphysics and will remain so for centuries. Metaphysics and logic To the essence-existence and reality-appearance distinctions a third characteristic of metaphysical thinking must be added — logic. It was RAYMOND J. DEVETTERRE 313</page><page sequence="6">Aristotle who saw the need of establishing formal structures and rules for thought, a detailed organon to assure the correctness of thinking, a logic. The primary characteristic of this logic is contained in the notion of grounding. It is a thinking that seeks causes and reasons. As the real is grounded and accounted for in terms of causes, knowledge is grounded and accounted for in terms of reasons. Thinking is opposed to correct opinion because it gives an account of things by elucidating their causes, reasons, grounds. This kind of thinking achieved great success on the ontic level of beings and enabled the Greek philosophers to overcome the prevailing skepticism and relativism of the intellectual climate of their day. Sustained by this logic, the study of beings as beings becomes a search for the sufficient reason of the generic traits and ultimate unity of these beings. The logic of metaphysics becomes "the name for that kind of thinking which everywhere provides and accounts for the ground of beings as such within the whole in terms of Beings as the ground (logos)."8 The -logy of onto-theo-logy is therefore unique. It does not simply indicate "science of' as it does in terms such as biology and psychology. In onto-theo-logy the -logy is more properly a logic, specifically the logic that attempts to give an account of the grounding principles and categories, causes and reasons, of beings. Once established, logic tends to dominate the real. The logical principle of contradiction, for example, is accepted as decisive for reality. Logical thinking is not content to say contradictions cannot be thought; it says they cannot be, contradictions cannot exist. The basic logical principle of sufficient reason is likewise extended beyond the logical realm to the real in the insistence that all reality be accounted for in terms of causes, aitia.9 The characteristics of metaphysical thinking are now manifest. Essen tially it forgets the ontological difference between Being and beings and hence forgets Being as such. It proceeds straightway to think Being in terms of the ambiguous on and the metaphysical distinction of essence and existence, each derived from a legitimate sense of the participle being. It is further characterized by the reality-appearance distinction that became the Platonic supersensible-sensible duality, the former eventually being divinized; by the Aristotelian onto-theo-logical first philosophy where beings as such are thought in ontology, beings as a whole in theology, and the thinking itself determined by the principle of sufficient reason. The whole history of metaphysics, according to Heidegger, consists in varia tions of these fundamental themes. A study of this history reveals two major approaches; the metaphysics of substance and the metaphysics of subject. The first type dominated the tradition until the beginning of modern philosophy when Descartes rep resented a kind of watershed. He introduced subjectivity yet remained in a philosophy of substance with his res cogitans, res extensa, and God. Leibniz began the second phase in which on he on is no longer substance but 314 CROSS CURRENTS I FALL 1980</page><page sequence="7">subject. Beings are now conceived as typifying the most notable aspects of human subjectivity, mind and will. Hence the monads of Leibniz, defined as the unity ofperceptio and appetitus, inspired the idealistic and voluntaris tic theories of modern philosophy that finally culminate in Nietzsche's will-to-power. In this history of metaphysics the representations of beings have been many and consequently so have the understandings of Being as ground. Common to all the variations, however, is the representation of Being as the Being of beings according to essence and existence, reality and ap pearance, causes and reasons. The switch to thinking Being in terms of subjective characteristics such as consciousness, desire, spirit, will, experi ence, feeling, etc., still leaves one locked in the metaphysical tradition. Even Nietzsche, despite his virulent attacks on the traditional metaphysi cal supersensible world of Platonic philosophy, remained caught in metaphysics. His beings are still conceived in terms of essence (the-will to-power) and existence (the eternal return); in terms of the really real (the wordly existential) and the apparently real (the Platonic ideas and values); in terms of a logic providing reasons to explain why things are as they are. As Heidegger's analysis of the history of Being unfolds, a haunting question flirts in the background. Since Western philosophy has been almost exclusively metaphysical in its development, it is fitting to ask: why should it not continue to be so? What is wrong with developing a logic of sufficient reason and representing the Being of beings in terms of the present, and in terms of the distinctions between essence and existence, reality and appearance? Why would onto-theo-logy be overcome? Why should it not continue as first philosophy? Heidegger's reason for urging the overcoming of onto-theo-logical metaphysics and hoping for "the end of philosophy," as one of his more recent lectures is entitled, can be summarized in one sentence. Metaphysics, by its forgetfulness of Being as such, is a distortion that generates nihilism and atheism. "The essence of nihilism which finally is fulfilled in the dominance of the will to will, is based on the oblivion of Being."10 The societal results are devastating: "the 'world wars' and their char acter of 'totality' are already a consequence of the abandonment of Be ing."11 According to Heidegger, overcoming metaphysics is no idle exer cise but crucial for the survival of the culture and perhaps even the species. Though few may be willing to follow Heidegger to this rather extreme position, his carefully developed and provocative thesis is an important challenge for contemporary metaphysicians. Whitehead's Metaphysics of Process Whitehead's process philosophy is a new metaphysics. It was apparently never considered by Heidegger nor have process thinkers chosen to RAYMOND J. DEVETTERRE 315</page><page sequence="8">comment at any length on Heidegger's claim that all metaphysics is inherently nihilistic. But it would seem that Heidegger's analyses are applicable to the innovative categories of process thought and hence present a challenge to the proponents of Whitehead's metaphysics. Process metaphysics and the essence-existence distinction According to Heidegger traditional metaphysics centered on the on, ens, being, which due to the inherent ambiguity of the participle, 'partici pates' in both nominal and verbal senses. Whitehead shuns the ambiguous term being, preferring instead the phrase "actual entity." While avoiding many of the difficulties of the more traditional word, "actual entity" will escape Heidegger's critique only if it can be shown it does not manifest the essence-existence dichotomy indicative of classical metaphysics. The actual entity is not a static substance supporting qualities nor an a priori subject that has an experience of an object but an "act of experience arising out of data. It is the process of 'feeling' the many data, so as to absorb them into the unity of one individual 'satisfaction'."12 This act of experience is the ultimate unit of reality. All "things" that we experience in the macroscopic everyday world are, metaphysically speaking, combi nations of diverse feelings entwined over various routes. Rocks as well as people are composed of feelings. Whitehead calls these feelings prehen sions and they are the essence of the actual entity. "The essence of an actual entity consists solely in the fact that it is a prehending thing (i.e., a substance whose whole essence or nature is to prehend)."13 The essence of an actual entity is its prehensions but these are not sufficient to make the entity actual, to make it "be." Something else has to account for its existence. This is provided by what Whitehead calls creativ ity, the "ultimate notion of the highest generality at the base of actu ality."14 Because it is an ultimate notion, the universal of universals, it is only "capable of characterization through its accidental embodiments, and apart from these accidents it is devoid of actuality."15 Hence it does not exist as a thing, it is not an actual entity, and it cannot be characterized as such. The dichotomy of essence-existence is thus apparent in Whitehead's notion of the actual entity: its existence is the actuality derived from creativity and its essence is its prehensions. Process metaphysics and the reality-appearance distinction Since the Presocratics, and especially since Plato's allegory of the cave, metaphysics has in some way regarded what immediately appears in naive experience as inadequate to account for itself. Another realm of beings somehow different from those that appear was therefore indicated. The beings of this realm have been understood in many different ways in the history of metaphysics but always as somehow more real than the deriva tive beings of our experience. Whitehead's philosophy exemplifies still another manifestation of this reality-appearance duality. 316 CROSS CURRENTS I FALL 1980</page><page sequence="9">What is the truly real for Whitehead? The answer is obvious: the actual entities. They are the "final realities," the "res verae," the "final real things of which the world is made up," the "really real things which in their collective unity compose the evolving," the "primary types of things."16 It is important to note, however, that an actual entity never appears in our experience; no concrete example of one can be given. The only realities that appear in experience are groupings of actual entities called nexus (plural of nexus). Usually they are ordered so as to be encountered as a stone, man, electron, etc. An ordered nexus is a society. Nexus and societies make up the world of appearance. If the actual entities were qualitatively the same as the nexus and societies so that they could be thought as co-given with what appears, the Platonic problem would be largely avoided. In Whitehead, however, the non-appearing really real things are not the same as the real things that appear to us. Actual entities are timeless, changeless, motionless; nexus are temporal, changing, moving. Change, time and motion occur only between or among actual entities but never within the process that consti tutes them. The actual entity is an atomic and discrete unit. Its "genetic passage from phase to phase is not in physical time," "the doctrine of internal relations makes it impossible to attribute 'change' to any actual entity," and "an actual entity never moves."17 A two stage cosmos, each with its distinctive "things," is thereby intro duced in spite of Whitehead's horror of dualities. In what is truly a "footnote to Plato" process metaphysics distinguishes non-temporal, changeless, motionless, really real final actualities that do not appear from the temporal changing moving nexûs of nature that do appear and he explains the latter in terms of the former. It should be noted that the reality-appearance distinction of process metaphysics does not develop into the usual supersensible-sensible dichotomy because each actual entity is composed of both physical and mental prehensions. The most material actual entity includes a mental pole, though it is trivial, and the most immaterial actual entity, God, includes a physical pole, and it is not trivial. Whitehead's cosmos does not divide into separate realms of nature and ideas, bodies and minds, and thus distances itself from much of the tradition. This does not exempt the metaphysics from Heidegger's critique, however, for it is the reality appearance bifurcation and not the physical-mental or sensible supersensible distinction that is the crucial flaw in metaphysical thinking. Although Whitehead's reality-appearance duality avoids the familiar sensible-supersensible duality, it does exhibit the other very common development of the reality-appearance bifurcation; it becomes theologi cal. For a metaphysics to be theological, the God need not be a creator, as he obviously was not in Plato and Aristotle, nor need he be perfect, immutable, totally transcendent, infinite, totum simul. For the metaphysics to be theological the God need only be the highest being in the system and RAYMOND J. DEVETTERRE 317</page><page sequence="10">the one that accounts for the others as a whole — that is, for their generic traits and their ultimate unity. Whitehead's process God, for all the differences from the God of classical theism, fulfills these important metaphysical functions. This God is dipolar. His primordial nature is constituted by conceptual prehensions and is the source of the generic metaphysical traits of our cosmos. His consequent nature is constituted by physical prehensions and is the source of the harmonious integration of all that is of value in the temporal process. The impact of God upon the world is spelled out in some detail by Whitehead. God provides three basic functions. First, he is the source of all possible forms that can characterize the actual entities, for his concep tual prehensions feel all the eternal objects. This function is important because Whitehead's eternal objects, which are by his own admission similiar to the Platonic ideas, cannotjust float in some detached sphere. By reason of what Whitehead calls the ontological principle they must be rooted in some actual entity and this can be none other than the supreme entity, God. Secondly, God provides the ideal motivating the actual entities to achieve the greatest possible harmonious intensity of value. Each actual entity derives its initial aim from God and its subsequent process of development consists in the modifications it selects as it realizes this ideal to a greater or lesser extent in the final development of its process. "In this sense God is the principle of concretion; namely he is that actual entity from which each temporal concresence receives that initial aim from which self-causation starts."18 Thirdly, God preserves the past. His consequent nature physically prehends all the actual entities of the universe that have been and will be. Nothing will be lost. Everything is therefore meaningful. Whatever of value each actual entity has managed to achieve will be integrated by God into the whole and any evil will be dismissed as trivial. "The consequent nature of God is his judgment on the world ... It is the judgment of tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved. It is also the judgment of wisdom which uses what in the temporal world is mere wreckage."19 For God to play such roles in the metaphysical explanations of the cosmos clearly shows him to be the supreme actual entity that accounts for the nature and unity of the other actual entities in the system. In a very real sense, then, Whitehead's metaphysics, as most of the tradition before him, is an onto-theology, a metaphysics of beings (actual entities) such that their generic traits and ultimate unity are accounted for in terms of the highest actual entity, God.20 Process metaphysics and logic If Whitehead's metaphysics is onto-theo-logic in the full sense of the word, it must manifest a logic characterized essentially by the principle of sufficient reason. This clearly appears in his insistence on the "ontological 318 CROSS CURRENTS / FALL 1980</page><page sequence="11">principle" that demands actual entities "form the ground from which all other types of existence are derivative and abstracted."21 That this ground is a causal ground in Heidegger's sense of the term is clear from Whitehead's equation of the ontological principle with "the principle of efficient and final causation" and the conflation of logical reasons with real causes so that "no actual entity, then no reason."22 And, as so often happened in the metaphysical tradition, God becomes the ultimate efficient and final cause of all else. God is the unique primor dial instance of indeterminate creativity who provides the metaphysical characteristics or generic traits of this world by qualifying all subsequent processes and bringing all actual entities together in a final harmonious unity. This role of God as causal ground is a very delicate point in any philosophy such as process thought where great care is taken to avoid classical theism. We have already noted how Whitehead uses creativity and not God to account for the existence of actual entities, including the actual entity that is God. Yet creativity is not itself an actual entity and this presents a problem. How can creativity account for the actuality of actual entities? Whitehead seems to have sensed this problem and, despite the role he gave to creativity as the ultimate, assigned God a definite causal role in the actuality of the actual entity. "The universe exhibits a creativity with infinite freedom, and a realm of forms with infinite possibilities; but . . . this creativity and these forms are together impotent to achieve actu ality apart from the completed ideal harmony, which is God."23 In the acceptance of these features of classical logic Whitehead's metaphysics continues the classical way of thinking, a way that revolves around the metaphysical distinctions of essense-existence and reality appearance, and is governed by the principle of sufficient reason.24 Whitehead's system does avoid the Platonic supersensible-sensible dual ity but, according to Heidegger, this distinction is not a crucial component of metaphysical thinking. Whitehead has also avoided many weaknesses associated with a metaphysics of substance but Heigegger's critique ex tends also to metaphysics of subject—that is, to any metaphysics that takes some facet of subjectivity as ontological paradigm and thinks all beings in terms of it. Whitehead's actual entity is a direct extrapolation from the activity of experiencing proper to a human subject. "In describing the capacities, realized or unrealized, of an actual occasion, we have with Locke, tacitly taken human experience as an example upon which to found the generalized description required for metaphysics."25 Whitehead "entirely accepts the subjectivist bias of modern philosophy" and the "doctrine that nothing is to be received into the philosophical scheme which is not discoverable as an element in the subjective experi ence," so that "apart from the experience of subjects there is nothing, nothing, nothing, bare nothingness."26 Only components derived from the thinker's analysis of his subjectivity are acceptable in metaphysical RAYMOND J. DEVETTERRE 319</page><page sequence="12">description of all reality. This situates Whitehead solidly in the modern metaphysical tradition and its tendency, according to Heidegger, to continue the oblivion of Being by thinking in terms of notions such as thinking, desiring, willing, feeling, etc., that characterize subjectivity. In such metaphysics, no less than in classical metaphysics, Being continues to be thought in terms of something other than itself and thus remains concealed. What Whitehead calls the "fundamental metaphysical question" remains what it has been for the entire tradition, namely, what is the Being of beings, or, in his words, "what is it to be an actual entity?"28 The question of the "to be" itself, the question ofEinai or Being, is not asked. Thought thinks only the "to be" of an actual entity, the Being of being, and not Being itself. In many ways Whitehead's notion of an actual entity composed of both conceptual and physical feelings is richer than the paradigm of mind or will extolled by the modern tradition, yet it is still a metaphysics cast in the subjectivist mold. It is unquestionably "not so vulnerable to attack as the essentialist, substantialist or idealistic metaphysics of other thinkers" but still very much exposed to a critique such as Heidegger's. A confrontation of this critique by process thinkers would be fruitful, although it will obviously be difficult in view of the radically different conceptual frameworks involved. Still, Whitehead's insistence that his metaphysics is inspired by the pre-Kantian moderns from Descartes to Hume suggests such a dialogue is possible. And Heidegger's insistence that his critique is inspired by the inevitable cultural destructiveness of any metaphysics taken as first philosophy indicates its urgency: What if even the language of metaphysics and metaphysics itself, whether it be that of the living or the dead God, as metaphysics, formed that barrier which forbids a crossing over of the line, that is, the overcoming of nihilism?29 A Whitehead-Heidegger confrontation might also help us get at the roots of the crisis of values that lies behind much of our cultural disorder. Does this crisis stem from the repudiation of metaphysics and the theol ogy rooted in that metaphysics, as many would claim, or are the nihilism and atheism logically inevitable and the historical consequences of the metaphysical tradition itself? Does the nihilism issue from an oblivion of metaphysics or from an oblivion of Being, from the forgetfulness of metaphysics or from the forgetfulness in metaphysics?

Whitehead footnotes this sentence: "For the analogue to the sentence cf. Meditation VI; substitute 'Ensprehendens' for 'Ens cogitans'." Whitehead's comparison of the res prehendens of process thought with the Cartesian res cogitans is significant given Heidegger's explicit critique of Descartes' metaphysics. 1 iProcess and Reality, p. 47. 1Hbid., pp. lOf. Whitehead's creativity might seem at first to be a non-metaphysical notion in that it is not an actual entity and therefore would escape metaphysical thinking which is directed to actual entities or beings. It might seem possible, then, to consider it as somewhat similiar to Heidegger's Being and thus an indication that Whitehead's thought is already an overcoming of metaphysics by its insistence on an ultimate that does not share the generic traits of the metaphysical actual entities. The crucial point, however, is whether Whitehead's ultimate can be thought as such and not just in regard to its manifestations. Heidegger readily grants metaphysics thinks more than beings. It thinks the ultimate, Being, but only as the Being of beings and never as such. By claiming creativity "is only . . . capable of characterization through its accidental embodiments" Whitehead remains within classical metaphysics. To think the ultimate, creativity, only as actualized in actual entities is, in Heidegger's language, to think the ultimate, Being, only as the Being of beings. This is, in Heidegger's opinion, the fatal flaw in 'metaphysics' since it indicates a forgetfulness of Being (creativity) as such. Heidegger wants "to think Being without regard to its being grounded in terms of beings," On Time and Being, pp. 2, 33. l6Ibid., pp. 32, 27; Modes of Thought (New York: The Free Press, 1968), pp. 151, 144. 17Process and Reality, pp. 434, 92, 113. lHbid„ p. 374. 19Process and Reality, p. 525. 20The "Whitehead without God" position advocated by Donald Sherburne is not without interest. Even if established, however, it would not remove Whitehead's metaphysics from Heidegger's basic critique. For Heidegger, as has been pointed out, metaphysics has usually been, but need not be, theistic. Cf. Sherburne's "Whitehead without God" in Process Philosophy and Christian Thought (New York: The Bobbs-Merrill Company, 1971), pp. 305 328. 21Process and Reality, p. 116.

This problem has been noted by, among others, John Cobb in /I Christian Natural Theology (Philadelphia: Westmins ter Press, 1965), pp. 205-214 and David Schindler in "Creativity as Ultimate: Reflections on Actuality in Whitehead, Aristotle, and Aquinas," International Philosophical Quarterly, XIII (1973) 161-171. 24Whitehead, always aware of the limitations of a too strict definition of logic, became more critical as the years went on. One of his last texts, dating from 1941, states: "The conclusion is that Logic, conceived as an adequate analysis of the advances of thought, is a fake. It is a superb instrument, but it requires a background of common sense." "Immortal ity" in The Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead, Paul Schlipp, ed. (La Salle: Open Court Publishing Co., 1971), p. 700. There is no indication, however, that Whitehead would reject what Heidegger considered the defining characteristic of the logic of metaphysical thinking, namely, the principle of sufficient reason. 2%Processand Reality, p. 172.

"As modern metaphysics and thus all metaphysics comes closer to its completion, anthropomorphism is expressly required and adopted as the truth." Ibid. ^Process and Reality, p. 218. In an important but neglected essay John Dewey expressed his serious reservations about Whitehead's metaphysics precisely because of his reliance on the mathematical and metaphysical modes of thought characteristic of the tradition. He con cluded this involved him in "the fatal weakness of the whole movement initiated by Plato and Aristotle."
