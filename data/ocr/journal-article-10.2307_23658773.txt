Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, 2005, 2 vols, Ii + 1230 pages. ISBN 84-00-08393-8. Acta Orient. Hung. 60, 2007 The two volumes comprise the proceedings of three seminars held at the Casa de Velâzquez, Madrid in 2000, 2001 and 2002 on the Almo had movement and State. The seminars took place under the auspices of the Casa de Velâz quez, the Departamento de Estudios Arabes at the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cienti ficas (Madrid), the UMR 5648 (CNRS-Uni versité Lumière - Lyon 2), and the Université de Toulouse - Le Mirail; and owing to this ex emplary Spanish-French co-operation, the or ganisera managed to bring together the best experts in this field of research. It is not a plati tude to say that the two volumes offer between them a truly state-of-the-art synthesis of recent research by the most outstanding scholars of Almohad society and history. Regrettably, a few papers fforn each seminar have not made their way into the collection for various rea sons, but those absences are fortunately few in comparison with the number of contributions in the two volumes. Each volume focuses on différent aspects of Almohad history. A long and analytical in troductory essay opens the first volume, in which the reader gets a thoughtful analysis of the main trends and findings in the nearly forty articles incorporated in the two volumes, rather than just a brief summary of the contents. Apart from this thorough Presentaciön, the entire first volume is dedicated to the exploration of the material aspects of Almohad culture, such as the fine arts, epigraphy and numismatics, and the ways in which these were made to serve the purpose of furthering Almohad interests and conveying their message to its intended récipi ents, an overall theme summarised in the sec tion-heading 'Los vectores del mensaje almo hade\ Visibly bulkier, the second volume in corporâtes two larger thematic sections with a roughly equal number of contributions in each.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 485 The first of these, titled 'Organization politica y militar - Ordenaciôn del espacio', is mainly concerned with the ways the Almohad period shaped and re-shaped the social and political structures of the lands under the empire's con trol. The second section comprises, under the heading 'Doctrina, actividad intelectual y prdc ticas religiös as', in-depth studies of various as pects of the thriving intellectual life in the Ibe rian Peninsula and the Maghreb in Almohad times. As dictated by the very nature of Almo had ideology, the articles in this section are largely - but not exclusively - concerned with religious subjects. The introductory essay is in Spanish, while the individual contributions are mainly in French and Spanish, with just two essays in English and one in Arabie. It is incontestable - and both the editors and the contributors repeatedly emphasise the point - that the Almohads were some of the most original innovators among the mediaeval Arab dynasties, there appearing to have been few domains of culture and society upon which they would not have left their mark. This must, and does, make them an obvious focus of schol arly attention in several fields of study. The edi tors stress the curious duality of the Almohads' ideological basis, whereby this dynasty suc ceeded to a large extent in gaining an almost total doctrinal independence from the Muslim East, an intellectual autarchy which gave them ample elbowroom for developing their own ideology, but which inevitably exposed them to much criticism by the 'orthodox' Sunnis since "[...] desde el punto de vista doctrinal, ese im perio se encontraba en los limites de lo que se consideraba aceptable para un musulmân orto doxo, y en algunos casos iba mâs allâ de esos limites" (p. xix). It is little wonder, then, that with the passage of time the Almohads would gradually drift, or move, towards a more 'tradi tional' or 'conventionaT (or perhaps more 'or thodox') doctrine, practice and political struc ture. This would also entail a graduai removal of the original legitimising principle of the dy nasty - which, as is well known, was essen tially messianic in character - and its replace ment by more usual, all-Islamicate patterns and structures - 'las formas clâsicas de gobierno' (p. xx). If one considers, in addition to their in novations and doctrinal originality, the fact that the Almohads were the sole dynasty ever to unité practically the whole of the Muslim West north of the Sahara - in the most inclusive sense of the word al-Maghrib - and that they thereby paved the way for a wide circulation of cultural products, ideas and persons ail over their realm, the importance of studying the period is too evident to need further arguments. Giving more than just a cursory survey of the topics treated in the two volumes would be far beyond the scope of this review, for the sheer variety of material that the collection en compasses makes it difficult to make a concise summary. As has already been mentioned above, the first volume's essays concentrate on the impact, deliberate or otherwise, of Almohad ide ology on various artistic products, like coins, epigraphy, Quran manuscripts, architecture - in cluding such specialities as plasterwork -, fab rics, furniture, and ceramics. The général thèmes of the second volume include such domains as the organisation of the Almohad military and fleet, the monetary, fïnancial and fiscal system, the chancellery, the dynasty's officiai doctrine, ideology and Propaganda (including the impor tant legitimising concept of jihâd), the tribal fundaments and kinship relations of the dynasty, the judicature, science, philosophy and theol ogy, Sufïsm, and poetry. Some contributions are regional studies on some particular corner of the vast Almohad polity (e.g. the région of Safi; al-Andalus; and the Hafçid rulers of Tunis and their relationship with the local °ulamâ'). The connections between al-Andalus and the Maghreb is, quite naturally, a prominent and récurrent topic in some of the contributions. This relationship, as the studies in the collec tion demonstrate, was actually a rather complex one, but disdain (with the Maghrebi Berbers on the receiving end of it) remained an important constituent element. Nevertheless, some line ages belonging to the former political and intellectual élite, like the celebrated clyâd of Ceuta, Banû Rushd of Cördoba, and Zuhr of Sevilla, apparently made a smooth transition to Acta Orient. Hung. 60, 2007</page><page sequence="3">486 REVIEWS becoming part of the upper echelon of the new Almohad political system, despite the latter's essentially Berber origins (p. xxxviii). In what follows, I will single out a few articles that I found particularly interesting - strictly by way of an appetiser for the potential reader. It is solely for personal scholarly preferences that all the following examples will be taken ffom the second volume - расе readers whose inter ests lie elsewhere. It is hardly surprising that the role of gene alogy is a récurrent theme in the section on politico-military structures, in which Constant Hamès's article is to be found. His essay ana lyses the impact of the matrilinear system of succession common among the Berbers and the West African peoples on the careers of Ibn Tfl mart and his successors, despite the efforts of chroniclers like Ibn Khaldfln to disguise this fact, or indeed their inability to discem it. To Start with, the very 'patronym' (in fact, matro nym) of the founder of the Almohad State, Ibn Tflmart, whose own personal name is unknown, clearly shows the typically Berber pattern of matrilinear descent. Moreover, he did not belong, contrary to what Ibn Khaldün's theory would dictate, to a family of tribal leaders, although he did claim sharijxan descent. His direct relatives would soon come to be marginalised by the dy nasty of cAbd al-Mu'min, whose reign con formed to the Arabie principle of patrilinear suc cession, as did the dynastie succession after him. The actual course of events is, however, heavily obscured by Ibn Khaldün, who maintains 'une théorie purement arabe du pouvoir' (p. 435), in which there is no room for a Berber system of succession, even at the stage of the ascent of Almohad power. Hamès's essay shows, among other things, how Ibn Khaldfln handles his data to fit them into his theoretical ffamework. Manuela Marin describes what she calls 'un aparato propagandistico dotado de una enorme eficacia y de una gran complejidad' (p. 451), whose various elements add up to a remarkably active style of rule, characteristic of the Almo had monarchs, who would ever appear accessi ble to their subjects (as Marin puts it, 'el califa es una presencia activa y déterminante', p. 454) Acta Orient. Hung. 60, 2007 through various mechanisms including the in cessant royal correspondance with the gover nors and other subjects, the frequently renewed formal oaths of allegiance (bayca), the arrivai and réception, in grand style, of many déléga tions from the différent parts of the empire, the founding of the tradition of haraka, that is to say the typically Moroccan tradition of 'poder ambulante' (p. 456), etc. The réception of délé gations and the other ceremonies symbolising and sealing the relationship of ruler with ruled had a well-developed, established choreogra phy that sought to make that close rapport mani fest. The centralisation of power and material riches, and the symbolic enactments of the ruler's munificence, contributed to the concep tion of the ruler as 'un distribuidor de benefi cios, tanto inmateriales [...] como materiales' (p. 459), and his propagandistic portrayal as such. This is the essence of what can be charac terised as a would-be totalitarian State1, in which the caliph is the sole source of all worldly goods and the guardian of a divinely decreed order. As Marin observes, it is a System in which just about any kind of résistance would have to assume the form of open rébellion, or would be portrayed as such anyway. The Almohads clearly favoured the fuqahä ' over the administrative élite that was the kuttäb, whose intellectual training had a literary focus and who played such a prominent role in the Mulük al-tawä 'if and Almoravid eras. The fu qahä ', for their part, made a compromise with a State power theoretically hostile to their Mâlikï school, as evidenced by the dearth of works on applied jurisprudence (ßqh al-furüc) in the Al mohad epoch. The so-called talaba had a newly significant and weighty role in the Almohad State structure and the society, although in fact the very définition of the group labelled talaba, as well as its principal subdivisions, appears to be a complicated subject. Emile Fricaud's essay explores the role of this category of intellectuals through prosopographic studies of individual 1 In fact, M.

The main concern of Delfïna Serrano's thoughtful essay is the issue of the imputation of anthropomorphism (tajsïm) to the Almora vids by the exponents of Almohad ideology. Such accusations being the core element of Al mohad Propaganda, their study is a great way to illuminate the nature of Almohad ideology as well as the intellectual links between Ashcarism and al-Ghazâlï on the one hand, and Ibn Tümart and his partisans on the other.2 Since charges of reprehensible religious views are too common to be taken at face value, modem researchers will often find themselves at a loss to détermine the actual truth of such accusations; but in this particular case, Serrano manages to separate the hostile Propaganda from the genuine kernel of Almoravid ideology, and she also identifies the motives behind the Almohads' efforts to record what was, essentially, 'una visiôn deformada de los hechos' (p. 816). As her article proves, the real novelty of the Almohads' approach to the long-standing theological debate on anthropo morphism is their characteristic insistence on the imperative of the state's enforcing the 'right' doctrine - another good indication of their to talitarian tendencies - and the fact that they would not hesitate to use this accusation as a political weapon, or, in Serrano's words, 'un instrumento privilegiado de oportunismo politi co' (p. 846). One of Halima Ferhat's two contributions to the volume is dedicated to the subject of the 2 M. Geoffroy's study also devotes much at tention to these questions. organisation of Sufi groups and their relation ship with the Almohad State; and a significant part of the study is concerned with the nature and the limits of the state's control over the Sufi communities. The ubiquity of the tension be tween Sufis and the political rulers, as well as the former's rejection of political power are well known, but Ferhat's study shows that this relationship was far too complex to be de scribed as a simple opposition. In fact, as the scholar convincingly argues, Ibn Tûmart's per sonality is strikingly reminiscent of some Sufi saints, and parallele between his ideas and prac tices and those of the mystics are ever so easy to detect. Moreover, several widely recognised Sufi masters - including Abü l-cAbbâs al-Qan jarây, Ibn Yallabakht al-Jazfllï and Ibn Khab bâza - can be said to have belonged to the en tourage of the Almohad ruler al-Mançûr and lived as véritable 'saints courtisans' (p. 1079). On the other hand, if there was anything the Almohads would not tolerate but repress with unfailing brutality, it was Sufis displaying the kind of messianic zeal that characterised the dynasty's own beginnings - a fine irony that, upon reflection, is actually quite easy to account for. Auguries are not usually expected of a re view, but the présent reviewer volunteers the prédiction that any reader even remotely inter ested in the Almohad period will find something - and probably a lot - of interest in these two volumes. This work is the kind of stimulating, fecund and engaging reading that one inevita bly finds oneself totally absorbed in. A real em barrassment of riches. Zoltân Szombathy Acta Orient.
