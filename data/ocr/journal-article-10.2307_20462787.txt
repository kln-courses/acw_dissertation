<plain_text><page sequence="1">WALTER SICKERT AND ROGER FRY: 'ALIGHT HERE FOR WHITELEY'S'* Caroline Arscott W alter Sickert's Queen's Road, Bayswater (Fig. i) was painted in I9I6, when the artist was fifty-six years old, and exhibited at the Carfax Gallery in I9I6 as no. i9.1 In I919, it was bought by the critic Roger Fry, who had made a huge impact on the art world by championing the work of Cezanne in England, and installed over his sitting-room mantelpiece. This article seeks to establish how Fry viewed Sickert's painting, and what Sickert was trying to achieve with this unremarkable scene of a man sitting in a shelter at an Underground station. The picture's setting is not distinguished by elegance, nor even by thrilling hideousness. Nothing in the way of natural beauty enters the scene, except possibly the bright daylight that strikes the flat Underground railway-sign. There are no notable architectural features: an enamel sign; some painted iron posts (the one on the left is a lamp post and links up with the glass globe of the lamp); a patch of bare yellow London brick in the top right; some obscured painted brickwork behind the sign, and a matching area of brickwork painted in the same pale green on the right side of the shelter; some indication of the large arches of the station shown as a slice of the arched opening (scarcely noticeable above the shelter); a wooden bench; and an absolutely bare station platform area, brought particularly to our attention by the face-on view of the platform edge that cuts right across the picture plane. Below, we see the shadowy area that takes us down towards the rail way line just out of sight. The location is not remarkable as a central symbolic point in London's life; it is not Piccadilly Circus, Bank or St Paul's. Queen's Road (now Queensway) is a residential area, somewhat out of the centre, known primarily, then as now, for its substantial terraced housing and the large department store, Whiteley's, which is very close to the underground station. The shop-name appears on the advertising sign that stretches across the top of the painting: 'Alight here for Whiteley's'. We cannot see enough of the man to consider him an interesting specimen in terms of his physical appearance or character. He has a flat cap indi cating a lower-class status, nondescript clothing, and a hunched stance; he leans forward slightly, his hand on his knee, and his legs are crossed. He looks as if he has been waiting for some time. * I would like to thank Christopher Green for discussing the outline of this article with me and for giving me much valuable advice. i. One indication of Fry's interest in the picture in 1916 is the inclusion of underground signs in the Omega Workshop decorative scheme produced in that year for Arthur Ruck at 4 Berkeley Square; F. Spalding, Roger Fry. Art and Life, London 1980, p. 191. The scheme was designed by Roger Fry, Nina Ham nett, Roald Kristian and Madame Courtney. 295 JOURNAL OF THE WARBURG AND COURTAULD INSTITUTES, LXXI, 2 OO 8</page><page sequence="2">296 'ALIGHT HERE FOR WHITELEY'S' Walter Sickert studied at the Slade School in London in i88i, having had three or four years experience as an actor, touring with companies led by Henry Irving and the Kendalls. He then became associated with Whistler, moving from the Slade to study in Whistler's studio in I882. By I885, he had fallen under the sway of Degas, which led him to undertake studies of the British music hall that paralleled, in many ways, Degas's motifs of the cafe concert. Whistler's painting involved a summary evocation of locale. Thin washes of paint skimmed the canvas, reducing the complexities of the real to a series of bands of colour, held together by the force of compositional balance and the kinship of hue and tone.We see this in theThames Nocturne scenes produced by Whistler from the early I870s. Sickert's shift in allegiance fromWhistler to Degas corresponded to an increasing conviction that there was a cost in producing this kind of unity and harmony. He looked rather to the naturalist commitment and the complexity of composition in Degas: 'mastery is avid of complications', he wrote.2 It seemed that such complexity could only be realised by building up a painting from preliminary drawings as Degas did, annex ing an observation of the real to the traditional procedures of pictorial composition. As a defender of Degas Sickert became identified with those within the British art world in the I89os who considered that dreary or vile subject matter was not an impediment to great art, because the subject could be redeemed by subtle, skilful treatment and composition. In defences of Degas, particularly those put forward in the furore around the I893 exhibition of Degas's cafe scene of I876 (by the I89os known as L'Absinthe), the point was repeatedly made that the expressive capabilities of an artist, and his or her ability to manipulate form and sensitively to register shades of difference in mood and character, could override any inherent distastefulness in the subject matter.3 The term 'treatment' was used in this period to refer to the element contributed by the artist in the expressive aspects of the composition. A picture such as L'Absinthe may be reserved as to the character of the figures-there is insufficient narrative to bring out character in the traditional manner, and quirks, propensities and ethical standing are left undecipherable but in the treatment of the setting, mood and general atmosphere are nevertheless discernable. This group of critics felt that these elements were important in con tributing to the success of the picture. Sickert left Britain for France and Italy for the period i898-i905. On his return, he found that the critical positions in avant-garde circles were being renegotiated. Fry was moving towards a formalist position, and Sickert's continuing concern 2.

MacColl along with Sickert and Fry, at this date included the idea of expression and character in their notion of the priorities for art, rather than insisting on a purely formal project. The critic D. S. MacColl spoke of Degas as the 'Master of character, of form, of colour', offering 'the intonation, the accent, the expression'; D. S.

In his defence of the artists identified as post-Impressionist, showcased at the exhibitions, Fry moved to a critical position that put formal issues of design in first place, and relegated the imitative aspect of art to second place. Narrative and anecdote also came to be seen as of little relevance to art's aesthetic effects.5 Fry continued to speak of the expressive aspects of art, but was more concerned with the temperament and sensibility of the artist than with the communication of mood and character in the scene depicted.6 Sickert did not follow Fry in this move to formalist principles, 4- Robins (as in n. 3), p. 52. For Fry's formal ist views, see also A Roger Fry Reader, ed. C. Reed, Chicago and London 1996, in which an interesting case is made for the limits of Fry's formalism and the danger of reading backwards from the formalism developed by Clement Greenberg. 5. '...by affirming the paramount importance of design, it [this art] necessarily places the imitative side of art in a secondary place ... has used form for its expressive, not for its descriptive qualities'; Roger Fry, 'The Grafton Gallery: An Apologia', The Nation, 9 November 1912, cited in Reed (as in n. 4), p. 115. 6. C. Reed traces the re-engagement of Fry with representation and forms of narrative in the years after 1918; Reed (as in n. 4), pp. 305-23. It is noticeable that Fry continued to set C?zanne aside from narrative,</page><page sequence="4">298 'ALIGHT HERE FOR WHITELEY'S' and showed relish both in standing against the adulation of Picasso, Matisse and Cezanne, and in holding on to elements of narrative. In his remarks on drawing in I9I2, for instance, he claimed 'it is just about a quarter of a century ago since I ranged myself, to my own satisfaction, definitively against the Whistlerian anti literary theory of drawing. All the greater draughtsmen tell a story.'7 The inclusive human comedy of Balzac and the corrupt characters of Henry James are alluded to in order to assert that the full range of human behaviour and human society are legitimate topics for art, which should not limit itself to neutral and innocuous subjects, nor to the refined and decorous.8 Insofar as he maintained an admiration for Cezanne, it was on the grounds of his participation in the Impressionist effort to attend to the real, to 'the whole field of nature'.9 He resisted the designation post-Impressionist for Cezanne, however, and poured scorn on what he saw as an effort to inflate Cezanne's reputation. Sickert had several one-man shows between I9IO and I9I4, and in this period his subject matter is decidedly grim: murder, prostitution and poverty feature in all his pictures. This is the period in which he exhibited a series of works showing naked female figures in dingy lower-class interiors. In some of the scenes there are two figures; first of all he experimented with two female figures, then quite often with a clothed man and a naked female figure. The seediness of the setting, and the dull or gloomy inertia of the figures' postures, made these pictures challenging. Viewers were ready to see the figures as prostitutes with their clients. Sickert raised the stakes by exhibiting the works with titles that referred to a notorious crime, the CamdenTown murder of Emily Dimmock in I907, the sensationalist media promi nence of which linked the crime in people's imagination to the gory serial killings of the i888 Jack the Ripper murders in London's East End.'0 The most striking work of this period is L'Affaire de Camden Town (I909, private collection). One preparatory drawing for this is inscribed 'Dettaglio/ Cn Tn Murder', and another 'Study for murder of Emily Dimmock in St Paul's Road Camden Town'. But ever tricky and wrong-footing the viewer, Sickert also adopted the practice of exhibiting works with alternative titles that radically transformed the implications of the scene. We also see him appending titles to projects developed under alternative names, so some of the preparatory drawings for the picture exhibited in I939 as The Camden Town Murder (c. igo8, Yale Center for British Art) also have What Shall We Do For the Rent? indicated as the title; the picture is also closely related to a drawing exhibited in I 91 I as Consolation. I I resisting any idea that his art was concerned with poetic or dramatic allusion. In 1927, Fry declared that C?zanne arrived 'at what was to be his most charac teristic conception, namely, that the deepest emotions could only exude, like a perfume - it is his own image - from form considered in its pure essence, and without reference to associated ideas.'; Roger Fry, C?zanne.

Modern debates about the identity of the Ripper have led to very close scholarly scrutiny of anecdotes and evidence pointing to the artist's interest in crime. Sickert regularly had recourse to the topic of the Ripper in conversation, and to another sensational trial, that of the Tichborne Claimant in the I87os. The claimant was accused of being an impostor: the mystery revolved around whether aristocratic relatives were freezing out a displaced noble kinsman, or whether the undistinguished claimant was fabricating his story.I2 Sickert claimed to have painted a picture of Jack the Ripper in I906; he also claimed (probably falsely) to have used the person acquitted of Dimmock's murder as the actual model for the male figure in the Camden Town murder scenes.I3We can say that, as much as he Was fascinated with the possibility that the scenes could allude to sexual violence and bloodletting, he was also intrigued by the idea that the scenes could be bland and eventless. He saw the potential for disguise, double meaning or multivalence. His artistic project was not a straightforward narrative presen tation, but one concerned with the conditions of narrative in a modern world marked by sensationalist media scoops on the one hand and relentless dreariness and anonymity on the other. Fry distinguished between Sickert's mode of drawing, and Picasso's or Matisse's involvement with structural elements in composition. 'Sickert still belongs to an older tradition, for it is evident that his conception of the function of a draw ing is different. It is pictorial rather than pictorially-plastic.'"4 He stood at a clear distance from Sickert's critical pronouncements on narrative, summarising Sickert's position as 'vehemently claiming that painting is nothing but illustration'.I5 Nothing could have been further from Fry's position, which looked to modern art for a 12. TheTichborne Claimant's effort to be recog nised as the legitimate son of Sir Roger Tichborne ended in his being sentenced to fourteen years of penal servitude in 1873 for perjury and forgery. See Sickert's work The Tichborne Claimant, 1930, oil on canvas, Southampton City Art Gallery. In the 1930s, an inscription made by Sickert on an etching of Roger Fry played on the common first name of Fry and the Tichborne Claimant (Arthur Orton, alias Sir Roger Tichborne); Sickert wrote on the portrait of Fry 'Roger (the claimant)'.

Nonetheless, Fry's comments on Sickert's work seem to view his artistic project as being much closer to Fry's own principles than might otherwise have seemed possible from an artist who took his critical stand on the centrality of illustration, the inevitability of narrative, and the importance of a dili gent registration of the world around us. In Fry's view painting should draw on the real, but in the process of composition it should remake the real, achieving a con struction that has stability, tangibility and complexity, as real in the aesthetic realm as material facts in the world. The key terms in Fry's formalist critical vocabulary came to be 'constructive achievement' and 'plasticity'. The evocation of three dimensions was key for him. To achieve this solidity some simplification was neces sary; this lead to the possibility of quasi-architectural construction. Cezanne was picked out as the modern artist who showed most clearly that the arrangement of form is at the centre of the artistic project. Fry summarised it as 'pass [ing] from the complexity of the appearance of things to the geometrical simplicity which design demands'.i6 Fry saw admirable qualities in Sickert's work, despite considering his drawing method as fundamentally descriptive rather than constructive. He did find elements of the constructive in the artist's composition, claiming that Sickert's instinct as a painter led him to produce 'intriguing and felicitous space composition' despite himself.I7 Reading Sickert's paintings in a way that Sickert's views on narrative seemed to preclude, Fry praised them as being marked by a detachment, an absence of an imaginative or emotional dimension, which enabled him to concen trate on formal values: His vision is curiously detached, not only from the commonplace, utilitarian values of everyday life, but also-and herein lies his peculiarity and his limitation-from the values of the emotional life. The peculiar harmony of muted tones that he seeks can be found in almost any scene, and if he attains his harmony of spacing, composition, colour and tone, he is satisfied. Things for him have only their visual values, they are not symbols, they contain no key to unlock the secrets of the heart and spirit.I8 In this account indifference, which is understood (and partly denigrated) as the legacy of Whistler, is allied to painterly instinct, making possible something much more important than the registration of the real, because constructive aesthetic processes come into play: 'I can imagine him saying that he painted what he saw, but it is evident that a process of readjustment of all the tones takes place, whereby all sudden and sharp contrasts are eliminated and each tone takes its relative place in the peculiar sombre scheme which is personal to the artist'.'9 Sickert was not to be deflected from his commitment to faithful illustrative depiction and richly i6.

He wrote provocatively about the merits of William Powell Frith's Derby Day (I858), explicitly cavilling at the fashion for Cezanne and for the current tendency to judge past art only in terms of 'the ancestors of Cezanne'.20 He started off from an assertion: 'It is natural to all ages to like the narrative picture, and I fancy if we spoke the truth, and our memories are clear enough, that we liked at first the narrative picture in the proportion that it can be said to be lurid.'2' The association of narrative with the thirst for the sensational was then pursued in the case of Derby Day in terms of the obscure details: for instance a lady in the middle distance seen in profile, 'superb and enigmatic'.22 The expressive depiction, and the capturing of expression, stance and dress through careful observation are extolled, as is the layering of information so that the picture's delight is not simply found in the surface quickly perceived, but is extended in variety and depth, taking considerable time to explore. 'A picture has perhaps the right to be, if it likes, not only a skin of wine, but a cellar, with its beneficent potentialities spread over, not one, but several lifetimes.' Such a picture contains hidden elements: 'Surprises lurk in the Derby Day like Easter eggs.'23 This account of the benefits of mimesis and narrative proposes painting that is multi-layered and even cryptic in its complexity, therefore reliant on hermeneutic procedures to be fully appreciated. Sickert and Fry were at odds over the achievements of Cezanne, but even more so over the direction being taken by Picasso in this period. Sickert was violently opposed to the Cubist works that he had had the opportunity to see, opposing Fry's efforts in this vein as well as Picasso's. He commented on Fry's Bus Tickets (I9I4 I5, London, Tate Gallery), asking 'What was the point of Essay in Abstract Design I9I4-I5, a collage of torn sheets of paper painted in oil and bus tickets?' Sickert found it 'surprising that a painter who has the double advantage of power and erudition should continue to treat seriouslyfumisteries 'a la Picasso ... "Why, we quit that junk in Paris seven years ago". 24 So what we see in the period after I910 is an uneasy relationship between Fry and Sickert. Sickert was not happy to go as far as Fry in severing aesthetic response from the emotions of real life and the mood and particular atmosphere of specific locations, and Fry consigned Sickert to the category of 'pictorial artist'. On the other hand, Fry did think that Sickert had his successes, achieving plastic construction within the picture, tempering his mimetic tendencies with a blank indifference.We can imagine Sickert fretting at the way Fry summarised his work: merely visual, void of emotional resonance or symbolic association. I would argue that in his picture Queen's Road, Bayswater Sickert deliberately set out to challenge Fry in various ways. It is my view that he made a picture that appeared to conform 20.

Certainly Sickert liked to needle Fry when he could; the comment he made about hanging a dreadful German picture over his fireplace 'pour emmerder Fry' is often quoted.25 Baron alludes to Sturgis's suggestion that the title Summer in Naples, assigned by Sickert in a 19I2 exhibition to the picture of I909 later known as Dawn, Camden Town, was a joking reference, for the benefit of Fry and his followers, to a picture by Cezanne called L'Apres-midi a' Naples.26 In I9II-I3, Sickert became involved with a young group of breakaway art ists who formed the Camden Town Group, including Spencer Gore and Harold Gilman. In an evaluation of Gore's work written after his death, Sickert wrote admiringly of Gore's ability to make art out of unprepossessing, plain and prosaic sights, which are in themselves so ugly that they might cause anguish to the aesthetically attuned viewer. He said of Gore: A scene, the dreariness and hopelessness of which would strike terror into most of us, was for him a matter of lyrical and exhilarated improvisation. I have a picture by him of a place that looks like Hell, with a distant iron bridge in the middle distance, and a bad classic facade like the facade of a kinema, and two new municipal trees like brooms, and the stiff curb of a new pavement in front, on which stalks and looms a lout in a lounge suit. The artist is he who can take a piece of flint and wring out of it drops of attar of roses.27 As far as the chosen location goes, this is modernity drained of any intrinsic drama: dull, hard, mean, inexpressive and tasteless. In these respects it seems to match up fairly well with the blankness of the setting selected for Sickert's own Bayswater painting. Yet Gore's painting, Sickert claims, produces exquisite beauty out of inert materials. This clearly is one aspect of what Sickert is trying to do. We might ask: is this the same as subtly expressing character and mood, despite the low subject matter? Part of the point here is the absence of character. Is it a question of subtly expressing the mood of an urban environment that has been stripped of character, evoking the experience of urban alienation in a city that has been ren dered stiff and pallid by modernisation? Or is it a question of setting that experience aside and substituting the beauty that the artist imparts? We can see that Sickert's comments on Gore come very close to Fry on Cezanne. Sickert certainly could understand Fry's position about the irrelevance of the motif; furthermore the choice of an unprepossessing, featureless locale might be taken as a move towards the substitution of the artist's constructive plastic vision for the enthralment to the faithful depiction of the real. Surely this is how Fry saw Sickert's painting Queen's Road, Bayswater and that is why he bought it in I919. Fry saw a picture that has a fascinating play between flatness and depth, which achieves a structural plasticity through the play of volumes and tones, achieving a nervous vitality in the 25- Clive Bell, 1956, quoted for instance by Reed (as in n. 4), p. 120; Sickert Paintings (as in n. 12), p. 9. 26.

Christopher Reed has commented on the way that the picture seemed to be 'tailor-made' for Fry: It is in Sickert's Queen's Road, Bayswater that the impact of the collector's taste is most evident. As if it were tailor-made to please his old friend and rival the composition is devoid of such Sickertian hallmarks as dramatic subject matter and quirky viewpoints, its effect resting almost exclusively on the spatial interplay of its forthright rectilinear structure.28 The point is echoed by Richard Shone.29 In the context of Fry's preoccupation with architecture, and the feeling for plastic form, the structure of the shelter can be taken to stand as a paradigm of artistic practice under the sway of formalist theory. I think Sickert was well aware of this possibility, and set up three zones of the picture to correspond to three touchstones in Fry's art theory. The first zone, the left-hand side, is the more flattened and abstract by virtue of the underground sign. It stands under the sign of the lamp; light and pure visuality correspond to the forms in this area. Within this zone it is possible to conceive of pure form. There is, I would suggest, a disguised reference to an object that Fry owned, an African reliquary sculpture from Gabon that Fry prized for its visual qualities, and which he understood to transcend cultural divides and tempo ral specifics (Fig. 2). This reference makes a single anthropomorphic form, striking in its two-dimensional frontality, out of a composite entity (station sign plus lamp post).With its dark support (shown on its right-hand edge), the sign would logically be understood to stand somewhat further forward, in front of the lamp-post, but in the picture this support is not extended sufficiently to allow us to place the sign securely on the ground in front of the lamp-post. The abbreviation of the leg forces it back in space, gluing it to the lamp-post. The clear clean enamel surface of the sign, and its simple colours and geometric forms, make it appear strikingly modern, and bring it into dialogue with the blue sign with white lettering that runs above the shelter advertising Whiteley's department store.30The integrated system of mass transportation, and the operations of the store, known by the name of the Universal Provider and unprecedented in its scale, with 6,ooo employees by I900, are put alongside one another, and are evocative of anonymised exchange in consumer society. The reference to reliquary sculpture, however, could be understood as investing this statement of forward-looking modernity with shades of death and memorialisation. The reliquary figure was used in Gabon tribal society as a guardian 28. C. Reed, 'The Fry Collection at the Courtauld Institute Galleries', Burlington Magazine, cxxxn, November 1990, pp. 766-72 (768). 29. 'It was perhaps this modernity of subject and clarity of presentation that appealed to the picture's first owner, Roger Fry, who hung it in 1919 over the sitting-room mantelpiece of his new house.' Shone, referring to Reed (as in n. 12), p. 258. 30. John Lessore suggests, on stylistic grounds, that the Underground and department store signs in the painting were not painted by Sickert but 'filled in' later by Roger Fry. I argue, on the contrary, that the disparity between these 'flat' areas and the more muted subtle tones and modelled forms of other areas of the painting was intentional and a crucial part of Sickert's project here.

A number of Kota reliquary figures entered the collection of the Musee d'Ethno graphie duTrocadero in Paris in the i880s.32The i886 installation of these objects in the Africa Room at the Musee d'Ethnographie was illustrated in Le Tour du Monde, alongside accounts of the expeditions undertaken to West Africa by Pierre de Brazza.33 The articles also included engravings, showing the original location of the figures attached to bark or wicker containers in shelters erected for the storage of ancestors' remains. Explicit reference is made in the accompanying text to the consultation of the ancestors in the hut of fetishes via the skulls of the departed.34 By i9i6, when Sickert painted Queen's Road, Bayswater, the meaning and aesthetic value of these figures was under discussion in avant-garde circles, since claims for their aesthetic value were being made by artists and critics such as Picasso and Roger Fry.35 Fry took an interest in African sculpture from I9I2, but the dates of acquisition of his African artefacts remain uncertain.36 The terms of the discussion can be gauged from the reviews of the exhibition 'Statuary In Wood By African Savages: the Root of Modern Art' in New York at the '291' gallery (organised by Paul Guillaume, 3 November-8 December I9I4), which included eighteen objects from the Ivory Coast and Gabon. Photographs of the installation show that a Kota reliquary figure was included, and Guillaume listed two 'Bakoutas' fetishes in his invoice to Stieglitz.37 The critics either quailed at the gross and bloody savagery of the pieces (as Forbes Watson did), or guided by the organisers tried to engage with the meaning of 'fetich art', understood to be a form of religion based 31. The comparison between the station sign and Fry's Kota reliquary figure has not been made, I believe, but Christopher Reed has compared a motif in Duncan Grant's Omega Design of 1913-14 (Cour tauld Gallery, Fry Bequest) to the same reliquary figure; see Reed (as in n. 28), p. 769. 32. It is suggested by Paudrat that the displays relating to Gabon in the Mus?e Ethnographique des Missions Scientifiques in Paris, opened on 23 January 1878, made it possible for the first time to see a Kota reliquary figure in France. Three Kota reliquary figures were received by 1884 from Schwebisch andTholon, and three more in 1886 from Brazza and Pecile; see Jean-Louis Paudrat, 'From Africa', in uPrimitivism"in Twentieth-Century Art (exhibition catalogue, New York, Museum of Modern Art, 1984-85), ed.

Charles Caffin went further, seeing the fetishes as grotesque on first sight, produced as they are in response to 'fear of mysterious agencies whose evil purposes he [the primitive artist] must avert', but nevertheless employing abstract means to convey aesthetic feel ing.38 This was an attempt to deploy the language of the avant-garde, and tallies with the arguments put forward by Fry when he came to publish on African art in I1920. The non-naturalistic methods in approaching the figure were linked to a non materialist belief in the power of spirits, and were said by Fry to enable constructive composition in plastic form.39 38.

The right-hand side of the picture, with its peeling bills overlaid on the wall, might be taken as a mocking reference to the papiers colles that Fry was enthusiastically studying in the work of Picasso. Wendy Baron picks out the abstract qualities of Queen's Road, Bayswater, describing it as 'an abstract reading of the pattern of posters and signage around the sheltered waiting area on the platform of his [Sickert's] local underground station'.40 She goes on to say that the rhythmic arrangement of rectangles in this work suggests that 'he was not imper vious to the current enthusiasm for cubist art'.4' It could just as well be an ironic commentary on such art. In the context of the picture this zone offers another take on the urban. Here the urban is not featureless and orderly, but messy and illegible, not smart and comprehensible, but abraded and nevertheless complex. In its tattiness it produces a kind of patterning. The modern environment is rendered picturesque by the processes of decay. One poster, half way up, seems especially white. The clean bright surface of the latest thing is placed over yellowing items that have been forgotten or superseded, burying and concealing them, though only partially and temporarily, since the underlying bills can reappear. In the centre is a third zone; this is the area of the picture that declares a commitment to pictorial volume, marked by recession and the perspectival setting of the shelter. This, as I have suggested, is yet another reference, made by Sickert, to Fry's aesthetic preoccupations, this time with the achievement of constructive plasticity in painting. Here too there are advertising placards linking the waiting passenger to commerce. The area is in shadow, and the posters are illegible, but the one on the left of the figure is of the simplest description, consisting just of the name of a product in a simple two-colour design. One might conclude that Sickert is challenging Fry's desire for depth by structuring the area of depth in the picture around this poster, which is literally flat and, furthermore, refers to the dull uniformity of commoditised culture. As a third description of the modern urban environment, this is the most muted, conveying drab isolation and inactivity rather than dynamic abstraction or fascinating decay. We can perhaps see a generic resemblance in the seated figure in the shelter to the portraits of the gardener Vallier by Cezanne. In these portraits, painted by Cezanne in his final years, Vallier was shown in a cap or battered straw hat, legs usually crossed, hands folded in an attitude of vacant repose or resignation. Sickert may have been familiar with one or more of these, for he exhibited at the same Salon d'Automne in Paris, where one portrait of Vallier was included as part of a large showing of Cezanne's work in 1907; Sickert went over to Paris that year for the autumn opening of the exhibition, as was his habit.42This point of comparison 39- 'Negro Art', Athenaeum, 16 November 1920; see Green (as in n. 3), pp. 128-32, 136. 40. Baron (as in n. 11), p. 102. 41. Ibid., p. 105. 42.

Sickert thus makes of the picture an amalgam between these three reference points for modern art, all of which can be associated with Fry. We might consider Sickert's assembly of these elements to be gently mocking, invoking as it does the prized topoi of modern art practice, while maintaining the depersonalised qualities of the modern urban environment. The neutral matter-of-factness could neverthe less harmonise well with Fry's expectations of the autonomy of aesthetic emotion, insofar as it escapes the trammels of narrative and dramatic description. Sickert however goes beyond mockery by smuggling, themes of death and violence into this rendition of the quotidian scene. The first indication of this is the citation of the reliquary figure. Brought alongside the sign for Whiteley's, a reference to the murder of William Whiteley, the store's founder, is I think discernible. Art-historical commentary has noted the fact of Whiteley's murder, but concluded, in the main, that the picture makes no reference to this.43 I wish to explore the possibility that the picture does indeed comment on the notorious events of January I907, when Horace George Rayner fatally wounded William Whiteley by shooting him. The murder took place in the original premises of the department store atWestbourne Grove. The main portion of the store was relocated in I9I2, opening in sumptuous premises on Queen's Road in I9I2, just four years before Sickert undertook the painting Queen's Road, Bayswater. Such was the shock produced by the murder that William Whiteley's portrait was published on the front page of the Daily Mirror on 25 January I907.44 A dramatic view of the murderer discharging his revolver took up the front page of The Penny Illustrated Paper on 2 February (Fig. 3). Whiteley's achievements and the novel system of his store were rehearsed in the press. His vaunted efficiency involved the management and close supervision of an enormous workforce. Whiteley's became notorious for its strict regulations regarding the behaviour of employees, many of whom were housed by the firm in special dormitories. The life and moral conduct of employees were stringently controlled by a system of regulations and Viellard; see C?zanne exhibition catalogue, Phila delphia Museum of Art, 1996, pp. 512-15), and The Gardener Vallier, c. 1906, oil on canvas (T?te Gallery, from AmbroiseVollard collection Paris to Frank Stoop, London, bequeathed by C. Frank Stoop in 1933; see Ronald Alley, Catalogue of the T?te Gallery's Collection of Modern Art Other than works by British Artists, London 1981). Gasquet's account of C?zanne dressing up in rags to pose for these pictures when Vallier did not turn up was not published until 1921 but surely would have fascinated Sickert with his penchant for donning costumes; J. Gasquet, C?zanne, Paris 1921, pp. 67-68. 43. 'Although the painting in no way refers to this notorious crime it is one more example of Sickert's connections with "the darker side of experience" - from the Camden Town Murder to the Tichborne Claimant and even to the 1930s theatre paintings in spired by the tragedies of Shakespeare and Marlowe.', Sickert Paintings (as in n. 12), p. 258. One recent ex hibition catalogue suggests that viewers would have made an association between the department-store sign and the 'sensation and scandal' of the Whiteley murder; Modern Painters: The Camden Town Group (as in n. 30), p. 150. 44. Many papers had illustrations consisting of full-page or double-page spreads, e.g., 'The Universal Provider and the Man who Shot Him', The Sketch, 30 January 1907, 'Sensational Murder in Westbourne Grove', Illustrated Police News, 3 February 1907, pp. 8-9.</page><page sequence="14">308 'ALIGHT HERE FOR WHITELEY'S' fines enforced byWhiteley: employees were fined, for instance, not merely for being late for work, but for staying out late in the evening, or for going into another's bedroom in the hostel.45 It was a vast operation involving an unprecedented range of activities, not just the running of sales departments, but also the catering, accom modation, and educational and social clubs for staff; the manufacture, processing or farm production of many items to cut costs; and the provision of a great variety of services, such as printing, interior decorating, estate agency, and the running of events and receptions. By I9I2, the shop listed all that it could do 'besides selling everything' in a long list, starting with 'Hair Dressing and Hair Dyeing', and going on to the final item 'Funerals Undertaken and Tombstones Erected'.46 The scale and modernity of its facilities were emphasised. Its laundries were described as 'the largest and best equipped in the world ... the machinery and appliances are of the most modern description only'.47 Whiteley always had a knack for publicity, and used catch phrases such as 'Everything from a pin to an elephant', and 'They'll marry you and bury you'.48 The idea of the provision of a coffin as the ultimate in service was central to William Whiteley's publicity. He became known for stunts, such as the one reported in Truth, where a gentleman (to win a bet) tried ordering a second-hand coffin from Whiteley's. It was arranged for two undertakers to march into the dining room during a dinner party with an undersized coffin, saying: 'Mr Whiteley's compliments, and he is very sorry he cannot get you a second-hand one, sir, so he's sent you a misfit.'49 The reports of Whiteley's own funeral, witnessed by crowds of up to a quarter of a million, pointed out that Whiteley's store 'true to the dead man's boast that the firm could supply anything' provided the hearse, coffin, flowers, carriages, and much of the mourning.5? The Whiteley hearings at the Marylebone Police Court, and the trial of Rayner at the newly opened Central Criminal Court, attracted huge public interest in February and March I907. By April I907, the leading new attraction at Madame 45- The system of fines became a public issue in 1886 with the defence of a thieving employee that the imposition of fines was unreasonable and that he had to steal to compensate for the amount he lost in paying fines; Linda Stratmann, Whiteley's Folly. The Life and Death of a Salesman, Stroud 2004, p. 142. There were accounts in the press of the 'seething discontent' of employees under the system of fines, e.g., Pall Mall Gazette, 10 August 1887, p. 3, cited by Stratmann, p. 157. In 1898, the Daily Chronicle gave an account of Whiteley's 'abominable temper' and abusive behav iour to his employees 'so he would go on, storming, browbeating, threatening fines, reports, dismissals', Daily Chronicle, 7 April 1898, p. 5, quoted by Strat mann, p. 179. A picture of the department store owner having a violent and arbitrary side was therefore circu lating in public from the 1880s and available as a factor in the response to his murder in 1907. 46.

From the evidence given on behalf of Rayner, and interviews printed in the press at this time, it appeared that Whiteley may have had sexual relations with two sisters, one of whom was a shop girl atWhiteley's; this was Louisa Turner, who started work in the toy department at the age of sixteen in I882, went to live in as an employee in the accommodation provided by the store, was taken up by William Whiteley, and eventually bore him a son registered as Cecil Whiteley Turner in I885. The papers reported her mother as telling how Whiteley used to take Louisa out: 'I never spoke to Mr. Whiteley myself, but I often saw him driving Louie about in his smart victoria and very grand and pretty she looked in her smart dresses.'52 From I883 for five years, Whiteley kept Louisa as his mistress, setting her up in a house at I3 Greville Road in Kilburn. It seems that the affair with Louisa precipi tated the break-up of Whiteley's marriage. Whiteley's wife told the press in I907 that the marriage foundered when he brought home a bunch of violets given to him by Miss --, one of his assistants: 'Plucked by her dear little fingers. ... It was Miss --, I suppose who brought matters to a head with us.'53 At the time, in I882, she sought divorce on the grounds of his adultery and cruelty.54 Louisa's sister Emily was Horace Rayner's mother, and Horace Rayner claimed that he was in fact the illegitimate son of William Whiteley. Having shot Whiteley he turned the gun on himself, causing serious but not fatal wounds. On his person the police found two small leaves torn from a notebook with a note in pencil clearly indicating his intention to kill Whiteley (and himself) if Whiteley did not meet his demands. 'To all whom it may concern. -William Whiteley is my father. He has brought upon himself and me a double fatality by reason of his refusal of a request that is perfectly reasonable. - RIP.' These scraps of paper, and the left-luggage ticket found in Rayner's hat, stand as the narrativised equivalents to Fry's abstract papiers colles. The press speculated as to whether Horace was deluded, confused, lying, or telling a version of the truth. He gave his name at the scene of the crime as Cecil Whiteley, which was a version of the name of his cousin (Louisa's son), five or so years his junior. It was found that he had several aliases, multiple addresses, and a wife and children in Bewdley,Worcestershire, and also that there was a young woman, a barmaid, fromThe Horseshoe inTottenham Court Road, who expected to be married to him. Emily Turner had claimed that Horace was the son of her common-law spouse George Rayner. George Rayner brought the boy up as his son, but at the time of the trial claimed to have had doubts about the boy's paternity, 51. The Times, 2 April 1907, p. 10. 52. Lloyd's Weekly News, 3 February 1907, p. 9. The information that emerges from the interviews is patchy, sometimes contradictory and often demon strably wrong, as Stratmann points out in her careful sifting of material in Whiteley's Folly (as in n. 44). In this article the focus is not the actual course of events in Whiteley's life, but the stories that were told and inferences that readers in 1907 may have drawn. 53- Lloyd's Weekly News, 3 February 1907, p. 9.

'I followed her to the station, but was only in time to see her get into the Brighton train with him.'56 The man in Brighton may have been George Rayner, but the 'mystery of the Misses Turner' as the papers called it was complicated by the pairing not only of the sisters, Emily and Louisa, and their boys, Horace and Cecil, but also by the pairing of George Rayner with William Whiteley. The two gentlemen were at one time close friends; one source told the press how they each had a house in Brighton at Kemp Town, used to ride to the city together, and were attached to two young ladies there, sisters.57 In court Louisa referred to a plan for George and Emily to move in with her in the house set up by Whiteley at Kilburn. Whiteley took the house in the name of Rayner, and it could have been a kind of double love nest. Rayner and Whiteley eventually fell out in I888 over the sisters and went to law, with Rayner issuing a writ for slander when accused of going after Louisa, and Whiteley settling and apparently paying costs.58 The story that emerged in the press of the men's relationship in the course of the parallel seduction and courtship of the two young women veered between collusive cosiness and mutual hostility. If Whiteley could imagine Rayner straying from Emily to prey on her sister Louisa, then the readers of the low-brow press in I907 could envision the reverse situation of Whiteley preying on Emily, the mistress of his friend. The fascination of the story for a reader such as Sickert was not just the violence and high drama when the colt revolver was fired in the fur and lace department of the department store in January I907, but the intricacies of the seamy history that emerged gradually in the courtroom and the columns of the press, a story in which identities seemed to merge and split. Though dressed in a frock coat and silk hat when committing the murder, Horace Rayner was in dire financial circumstances; his belongings had all been pawned or repossessed. He appeared in court in crumpled shabby clothes and a grey tweed cap.59 Horace Rayner was seen by some as a poor man making a reason able request of a wealthy man who could well afford to help him and may indeed have had obligations to him.The murder was seen by some as an act of revenge for the seduction of his mother. Sympathisers felt sorry for Rayner, driven to violent 55- Statement issued by Rayner's solicitors printed in The Times, 29 January 1907, p. 11, and widely reported in other papers. 56.

An article in the Penny Illustrated Paper in the following year, I908, on the high number of unsolved murders in modern times commented that 'there is something decidedly uncomfortable in realising that we risk rubbing shoulders in the 'bus or train or restaurant with the undetected murderer'.66 The blandness of workaday urban existence could be experienced another way when reality was filtered through the lurid preoccupations of the popular press. Quiet anonymity could be rendered suspect and queasy. The shuttle between Fry's version of Sick ert's practice as blank, indifferent visual depiction, and Sickert's insistence on the pictorial intimation of lurid narratives, echoes just such a shift in perception. 60. 'One would think that the highest form of citi zenship was for young men to go about murdering old men whose lives had not been so moral as they might have been.'; Lloyd's Weekly News, 31 March 1907, p. 1. 61.

The imminent birth of the child to Mrs Horace Rayner was thought to have swayed public opinion; see 'The baby who saved a man's life', Penny Illustrated Paper, 13 April 1907, p. 2. 62. The speculation about the murder mirrors the speculation caused by the devastating series of fires that occurred at the Whiteley's premises in the 1880s, prompting the Pall Mall Gazette to offer the sugges tion in an article 'Why Is Whiteley's So Often Burnt Down?' that there were three possible perpetrators: a rival tradesman, some injured lady/embittered lover, or a discontented employee with a grudge; Pall Mall Gazette, 10 August 1887, p. 3, cited by Stratmann (as in n. 44), p. 157. 63.

Penny Illustrated Paper, 31 October 1908, p. 3.</page><page sequence="19">CAROLINE ARSCOTT 3I3 Sickert moved back to Bayswater in January I9I5, and that year saw another less high-profile Westbourne Grove murder mystery, involving the hostels set up forWhiteley's female shop assistants.i7 Sickert may have read about the case in the local press and have been reminded of the events of eight years earlier. It was a sad story that unfolded after the macabre discovery of two mummified babies' bodies in a trunk in one of the Whiteley's residences. This was discussed as 'the sordid mystery of the iron trunk' (a story on a page of the local paper containing a large banner headline advertising Whiteley's Summer Sale), or in the national press as the 'Westbourne Grove Mystery', under the headline 'Bodies In A Box'.68 The mother of the children, Ellen Louisa Tibbatts, had been an employee of Whiteley's. She was tracked down, and claimed that the children had been stillborn. She said to police: 'The father of the children was a gentleman I used to know. I will not give his name, as he does not know that I have had the children and what I did with them. My husband does not know anything about it, and I hope he never will, as we are very happy together.'69 Dissemblance, cross-class liaisons, bastard progeny and gruesome corpses crop up once again in this piteous tragedy. Disguise, seduc tion, illegitimacy and murder were topics that held an abiding interest for Sickert. The juxtaposition of the Queen's Road underground sign and the Whiteley's sign in Queen's Road, Bayswater could therefore be said to point to various narratives, via reference to the human remains in Gabon ancestor cults, the vaunted under taking services of Whiteley's department store, the corpse of Whiteley, paternalist and progenitor, and even the pathetic, tiny, paired corpses in an iron trunk belong ing to Ellen Tibbatts. The doubleness or duplicity of the figures in the Whiteley case accord with two versions of Sickert's own identity: the artist described by Fry in his summary for whom things 'have only their visual values, they are not symbols, they contain no key to unlock the secrets of the heart and spirit', and an alternative figure who was deeply concerned with symbols and secrets that lurked in the visual.7? Competing views of modernity are presented in Sickert's painting. The shiny surface of clean, modern efficiency, indicated on the left, could be set against the ragged surface where the printed bills ineffectively paper over hidden events, indicated on the right. The enigmatic figure who sits in shadow between these competing versions of the modern world does not have to be Rayner contemplat ing murder, it can just as well be taken as a representation of any employee of Whiteley's, or any consumer in the modern mass market. All are subject to degrees of constraint and despair produced by the illusions and exigencies of the commer cial world. Or perhaps all can be envisioned as sitting in moments of not unpleasant blankness in the quiet between Underground trains. Sickert has crafted an intricate 67. Sickert moved to 9 Kildare Gardens, West bourne Grove, in February 1915, staying there until 1917; Baron (as in n. 11), p. 139. 68. Paddington, Kensington and Bayswater Chronicle, 26 June 1915, p. 5, and The Times, 21 June 1915, p. 5. Sickert may have been following the serialised story in this paper 'The Hangman's Noose' by John L. Carter about the murder of a medical man Sir Ambrose Gervaise and the involvement of two brothers, one the killer and the other the main suspect. 69.

For Sickert, in opposition to Fry, the depth of a picture may reside in its coded allusions rather than in its architectural construction and sense of plastic form.
