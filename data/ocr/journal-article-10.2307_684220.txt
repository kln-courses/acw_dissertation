National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC, April 30, 1999-January 2, 2000. Ainu: Spirit of a Northern People. William W. Fitzhugh and Chisato O. Dubreuil, eds. Washington, DC: Arctic Studies Center, National Museum of Natural History, in collaboration with University of Washington Press, 1999. 415 pp. Ainu history itself has a history, and it is not straightforward. Richard Siddle, Ainu: Spirit of a Northern People (p. 67) It seems that little about the Ainu peoples of northern Ja- pan is straightforward. Their origins and language, their history, and their place in contemporary Japanese society are still in dispute. A former seafaring people, they once commanded a large territory known as Ainu Moshir stretching from northern Honshu up through Hokkaido to Sakhalin and the Kurile Islands. Today Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's four main islands, remains the Ainu's principal homeland. Approximately 25,000 indi- viduals self-identify with the community through formal registration; many times that number are presumed to have blended into the larger Japanese population, both for eco- nomic reasons and to avoid the discrimination and social stigma that have shadowed their number for centuries. Scholarly interest in the Ainu began almost immediately following the Meiji Restoration of 1868, which permitted foreigners limited access to Japan's northern region. Moti- vated in part by racial theories that attributed Ainu origins to a remnant Caucasian population, these early researchers sought to document Ainu lifeways and material culture in the expectation that their subjects would soon "vanish" into history. Such efforts culminated in groups of Ainu be- ing "exhibited" in America and England early in the twen- tieth century. By 1915, however, interest in Japan's north- em people had waned, owing partly to the press of world events and partly to the feeling that assimilation had al- ready done its work. Of course, the Ainu did not vanish. As the present exhibition, co-curated by William Fitzhugh and Chisato O. Dubreuil, makes clear, a growing indigenous peoples movement has strengthened and energized the group in the modem period. At the same time, the opening of the former Soviet Union to archaeologists and other scholars has fostered renewed interest in Ainu origins and culture history. Ainu: Spirit of a Northern People was born in large measure out of a diplomatic contretemps. Bill Fitzhugh, it seems, had wanted to include the Ainu, whose seal- and whale-hunting, shamanism, and art suggest connections with other northern peoples, in an earlier Arctic Studies Center exhibition, Crossroads of Continents: Cultures of Siberia and Alaska. His Russian partners at the time, how- ever, lacked formal relations with Japan and feared that such an inclusion would resurrect unpleasant Cold War history, namely, the final expulsion of Ainu peoples from Sakhalin and the Kuriles in 1945. It was an "unfortunate omission," Fitzhugh concedes, that likely would not have occurred in the post-Soviet era. The exhibition was inspired as well by an inventory of Ainu materials in European and North American museums conducted by Japanese anthropologists and museum spe- cialists. Surveys between 1990 and 1996 (coordinated by Yoshinobu Kotani of Nagoya University) identified ap- proximately 3,200 ethnological specimens and associated archival holdings in natural history and art museums in the United States and Canada. In addition to uncovering a wealth of significant new materials, the survey team dis- covered that Western holdings were often older and better documented than Ainu collections in their own country. According to Fitzhugh, a primary objective, therefore, was to "get the American stuff' out in public. In all, about a quarter of the nearly 250 artifacts in Ainu: Spirit of a Northern People, as well as the photographs and archival film footage, derive from Smithsonian collections. With a few exceptions (the archaeological specimens, genre paint- ings, and modem artworks, which Japanese institutions supplied), the remainder came from other North American</page><page sequence="2">878 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST * VOL. 102, No. 4 * DECEMBER 2000 institutions, including the American Museum of Natural History, the Brooklyn Museum, the Buffalo Museum of Science, the Field Museum, the Milwaukee Public Museum, the Peabody Essex Museum, and the Peabody Museum at Harvard University. As plans for an exhibition began to take shape, Kotani in 1992 invited his American colleague to meet with scholars and examine Ainu collections in his country. Highlights of Fitzhugh's tour included a visit to Nibutani, a traditional Ainu village on Hokkaido, and a conversation with Shig- eru Kayano, a leader of the effort to preserve Ainu lan- guage and culture. Japanese and American scholars there- after began visiting back and forth, while a team of American curatorial advisors was established in this coun- try. Fitzhugh admits that he was sternly lectured at this time by a Native American activist with ties to the Ainu for seemingly excluding prominent Ainu cultural leaders from the team. Therefore, after receiving a Smithsonian plan- ning grant, he turned his attention to locating a suitable liai- son to the Ainu community. Chisato "Kitty" Dubreuil, an art historian of Ainu descent living in the Pacific North- west, emerged from the search. Initially given the title "Ainu Exhibit Coordinator," Dubreuil was later promoted to co-curator. Dubreuil and her husband, David Dubreuil, who became project manager, made two trips to Hokkaido in 1996 where they visited with Ainu elders, traditional and con- temporary artists, cultural leaders, business owners, and young people. In "Ainu: The Anatomy of an Exhibit," a good-natured chronicle of the planning process posted pe- riodically on the Arctic Studies Center website (http:// www.mnh.si.edularctic/html/ainu.htm), Dubreuil writes of this collaboration: "We have selected a new name for the exhibition, 'Kamuy: Spirit of The Ainu-Art, History, and Culture of Japan's Northern People.' The Ainu didn't re- ally care for the old title, 'The Ainu: Lost Treasures-Liv- ing Cultures,' and asked us to think of a new one. 'Kamuy' refers to their gods, and as the Ainu are very spiritual, the new title is much more appropriate, and has been very well received by the Ainu." In addition to the title change (which, in the final ver- sion, was shortened), a main theme-"Ainu ethnicity or cultural identity as it has evolved over several thousand years"--emerged from discussions with American project scholars Laurel Kendall, Amy Poster, and Adrian Katz. "We thought it important to present the unexhibited tradi- tional collections in the broader context of Ainu history, ar- chaeology, traditional ethnology, modern life and arts with an emphasis on Ainu culture as a living tradition," Fitzhugh writes in his catalog introduction. "In time, the concept of ethnicity as it relates to 'Ainu-ness' at different periods in history and from different thematic perspectives became the organizing principle behind [the exhibition]" (pp. 12-13). Secondary themes were to include Ainu spirituality, trade with other Pacific Rim peoples, the con- temporary vitality of Ainu traditions, and contemporary fine arts. A retrospective tour of the exhibition (which closed in January 2000) illustrates how these themes were incorpo- rated in the final installation. Entering the gallery from the Rotunda, one passed between two life-size wooden fig- ures, a man and a woman, identified in label text as re- spected Ainu elders, Ekashi-zo and Fuchi-zo. Text panels introduced the visitor to the geographical distribution of historical Ainu populations and two core concepts, Ainu moshir ("the Land of Humans") and Kamuy moshir ("the Land of Gods"), that were carried through the rest of the exhibition. The entry also included "Faces of the Ainu," 16 photographic portraits of men, women, and families made between 1888 and 1905 by Smithsonian curator Romyn Hitchcock, Polish ethnographer Bronislaw Pilsudski, and Jesse Tarbox Beals, who documented the Ainu contingent at the Louisiana Purchase Centennial Exposition in Saint Louis in 1904. Succeeding galleries treated Ainu history in essentially chronological fashion, beginning with the still-vexing is- sue of Ainu origins. Acknowledging discontinuities in the archaeological record, notably a paucity of evidence for the period A.D. 1000-1300, the curators cited a growing consensus that the Ainu are ancestrally related to the Jo- mon peoples who occupied much of the Japanese archipel- ago through the Neolithic era. Though displaced in the south by immigration from the Korean peninsula begin- ning around 2,000 years ago, in the north the Jomon blended with or evolved into the Satsumon and Okhotsk cultures, whose descendents, it is assumed, became the Ainu. Several cases of stone, bone, and earthenware arti- facts, many of them incorporating bears, owls, and other Ainu-like design motifs, provided substance for this con- jecture. Overall, the curators concluded that the Ainu peo- ple have existed for "at least 700 years," but with roots reaching back more than 10,000 years. From the fourteenth through seventeenth centuries, the Ainu developed as important intermediaries in a dynamic maritime trading network that stretched throughout the north Pacific. They traded animal furs and marine products with Manchurians and Russians for silk, glass beads, and other products and with the Japanese for iron implements, rice, cotton fabric, lacquerware, knives, and swords. A 12- foot model of a traditional seagoing canoe, carved espe- cially for the exhibition by Masahiro Nomoto, a curator at the Ainu Museum in Shiraoi, Hokkaido, highlighted this maritime mastery (Figures 1 and 2). To the extent that such trade created a loosely knit Ainu polity, it also fostered an unstable dependency among trad- ing partners. Under the heading "Changing Times, Losing Battles," the curators detailed how the Matsumae clan, given an exclusive charter over the territory then known as Ezo, began encroaching on Ainu fisheries and inland re- sources. Following a series of unsuccessful revolts, the Ainu</page><page sequence="3">MUSEUM ANTHROPOLOGY 879 11w . ... ... ... . . . . . . . Figure 1.

Fitzhugh. found themselves displaced from their coastal settlements and working as indentured labor to Japanese merchants. With the Meiji Restoration in the mid-nineteenth century, Hokkaido was incorporated in the new Japanese state and its "vacant" lands opened up for settlement. Facing an in- flux of farmers and other settlers, the Ainu retreated ever farther to the interior. A pair of panels, "Through Japanese Eyes" and "Through Western Eyes," explained that much of what we know today of the earlier Ainu culture derives from two sources: paintings of Ainu customs and manners (Ainu-e) created by Japanese artists from the mid-1700s through the early 1900s, and documentary images made by Western photographers. While acknowledging the potential bias in these resources, the curators used them effectively throughout the exhibition to provide context for traditional Ainu subsistence practices, craft industries, and social and spiritual life. n?

Material objects in the two main galleries were grouped largely by function: hunting and fishing gear; food gathering, gardening, and cooking implements; and elaborately deco- rated garments fashioned from fish and seal skin, elm bark, nettle fiber, and cotton. Additional cases introduced the viewer to the concept of kamuy, the world of spirits, ani- mate and inanimate, which the Ainu believe shape human destiny. They included ritual articles like swords, amulets, and musical instruments associated with Ainu shamanism and spirit possession, as well as elaborately carved men's prayer sticks (ikupasuy) and tufted willow sticks (inaw), the latter said to symbolize birds that carry prayers to the gods. These "ethnographic" galleries concluded with a full- size replica of a traditional one-room Ainu house (chise), opening onto a re-creation of a bear-sending ceremony (iyomante)-a defining rite in which the slain animal's soul is returned to the sky world where the bear deities re- side (Figure 3). An adjacent video monitor displayed early- twentieth-century film footage of other Ainu rites, includ- ing a housewarming ceremony; a ceremony to Fuchi, goddess of the hearth; and marriage and funeral rites. Leaving the main halls, the historical narrative resumed with mention of the Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protec- tion Act, enacted in 1899. Promulgated in humanitarian terms, its true effect was to hasten Ainu assimilation into mainstream Japanese society while denying community members the use of their language and the practice of im- portant rites. Ultimately, many were obliged to seek a live- lihood in tourism. While Ainu leaders over the next several decades organized for improved living conditions and better educational opportunities, it was not until the 1960s and 1970s that a new generation of activists, motivated in part by contacts with indigenous peoples outside Japan, be- gan agitating for civil rights. Their efforts culminated in 1997 with the repeal of the flawed Protection Act and the</page><page sequence="4">880 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST * VOL. 102, No. 4 * DECEMBER 2000 establishment of a new "Ainu Cultuial Promotion Law" (Ainu Shinpo). From this point forward, the curators focused on the theme of "cultural renewal." During the 1880s, the govern- ment constructed a rail network in Hokkaido and began promoting Hokkaido's wild, unspoiled environment and its Ainu people as a tourist attraction, a kind of "Wild North" of Japan. Among the items that the Ainu were en- couraged to produce as souvenirs were wooden bear carv- ings. This activity, according to the curators, inspired great ambivalence, as bear images previously adorned only rit- ual articles. (Similarly, in the 1920s some Sakhalin Ainu began carving small anthropomorphic figures known as "Ainu dolls" [nipopo], which again seem to have derived from ritual items, in this case children's amulets.) Never- theless, by the 1920s bear carving was flourishing and in- dividual artisans-such as one who in 1936 was invited to fashion a bear for Emperor Hirohito--were emerging in their own right. Many began signing their works, an action that inspired increased sales and further interest in Ainu handicrafts. By the 1950s and 1960s, visitors to Ainu country were being treated to staged performances in re-created villages and encouraged to take home carved spoons, wooden san- dals, miniature totem poles, and other curiosities. Totem poles, it appears, were first employed as comical "adver- tisements" to induce tourists to enter local craft shops. Though not original to the Ainu-the curators speculated that their use might have been inspired by U.S. servicemen stationed in Hokkaido during the occupation years after World War II-in modem times they have taken on Ainu characteristics and have been appropriated as symbols of Ainu identity. More recently some Ainu artists, foremost among them sculptor Bikky Sunazawa (1931-1989), have sought to narrow the distinction between "ethnic art" and contempo- rary or world art generally. Bikky's story, as told in Kitty Dubreuil's catalog essay, is an especially poignant one. As a youth, he endured the taunts of grammar school class- mates, an experience that left him with deep-rooted feel- ings of inferiority. His curiosity and natural talents, how- ever, took him as a young man to the avant-garde art world of Tokyo, then later to British Columbia where he came under the influence of celebrated Haida artist Bill Reid. His style, Dubreuil writes, changed dramatically after this en- counter, especially the manner in which his work would evoke his natural and spiritual surroundings. Impressed as well by the status native artists enjoyed in North America, Sunazawa returned home convinced that "being an Ainu could be a productive force in his career" (p. 346). Sadly, his death from cancer at age 57 robbed his community of both an exceptionally talented artist and a passionate advo- cate for social justice and renewal.

(Juka)-anchored the final two galleries (Figure 4). The latter also included bear, bird, and marine mammal carv- ings by Takeki Fujito, who also created the life figures flanking the exhibition entrance; semi-abstract paintings by Bikky's daughter, Chinita Sunazawa; and symbol-filled wall hangings by fabric artist Noriko Kawamura. A short video, "Voices of the Ainu Today," provided visitors with a closing mix of traditional and modem images. Narrated by Kitty Dubreuil, the video stressed that Ainu people function well today in contemporary society but that they also acknowledge the enduring importance of kamuy in their daily lives. Exhibitions are by their very nature short-lived phenom- ena. That is why the accompanying 415-page catalog, which contains no fewer than 55 essays organized in six sections, is such a welcome addition to the English-lan- guage literature on the Ainu. The first and second sets of essays marshal archaeological, linguistic, and historical evidence about Ainu origins and the complicated history of relations with the Japanese from medieval to modem times. A third set of essays provides fascinating insights into the early collectors who assembled the major Ainu collections in Japan and the West. The remaining essays deal with traditional Ainu beliefs and social institutions, Ainu art, and contemporary social and political issues, re- spectively. Copiously illustrated, the catalog also includes an artifact checklist and an extensive bibliography. Reading through this rather formidable volume, I under- stood better the challenge facing the planners in distilling from a very complex story a simplified linear narrative. The Ainu were not-and are not-a monolithic group. Historically they occupied several distinct macro-environ- ments that greatly affected local subsistence patterns, so- cial organization, and other cultural features. It is little wonder then that the curators settled on art and material culture as narrative vehicles throughout much of the</page><page sequence="5">MUSEUM ANTHROPOLOGY 881 exhibition. "With the inclusion of Ainu art, visitors will see a culture revitalizing itself and simultaneously creating new traditions," the exhibition prospectus reads. "A re- markable resurgence of Ainu culture is now taking place. Ainu men and women are revitalizing traditional Ainu arts, such as attush, or woven elm-bark garments. They are reestablishing the Ainu language and traditional musical instruments. Building on the experience of producing tour- ist art, which once provided a painful but crucial means for economic survival, Ainu artists are developing important new forms of fine art that are characteristically Ainu." The exhibition that resulted, however, was not in the strictest sense an art exhibition. Most of the objects, con- textualized in thematic settings, were subordinated to the narrative. Even the two galleries of contemporary art seemed not so much to highlight artists' personalities or to privilege individual pieces as to emphasize Ainu culture at a point of revitalization. Therefore, one looking for a dis- play of, say, Ainu robes (which, by the way, could easily carry an entire exhibition in the manner of Navajo blan- kets) would likely have been disappointed. In fact, Fitzhugh told me that the original deliberations included the possibility of simultaneous exhibitions at two other Smithsonian museums, each framing a different as- pect of Ainu culture: a presentation of Ainu-e at the Sackler Gallery across the Mall, for instance, and a more commu- nity-centered exhibition at the National Museum of the American Indian in New York City. (The Dubreuils, I might add, participated in a special component of the Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife in 1996, one that invited curators and other staff to share their research experiences with the public. No Ainu program, however, occurred during the actual tenure of the exhibition three years later.) It is particularly unfortunate that this broader vision wasn't realized, as it could have mitigated the prob- lem of one exhibition having to bear the weight of three. The installation at the National Museum of Natural His- tory, Fitzhugh explained, was limited to 5,500 square feet of floor space, as is typical with traveling exhibitions. The Smithsonian Special Exhibitions Fund contributed initial planning monies, while designers and model builders in the Institution's Office of Exhibits Central created the Ainu house and the adjacent bear-sending ceremony. An outside design firm and some of the Ainu consultants did the rest. Because of other priorities, the Smithsonian pro- vided neither implementation support nor permission to seek American corporate or foundational underwriting. A protracted effort to secure funding in Japan led in time to a substantial grant from the private Nippon Foundation, with additional support and services provided by the Japan Foundation and several other cultural agencies and air- lines. Wrote Dubreuil in her exhibit journal: "On one hand, being a Smithsonian project brings with it instant [credibil- ity], and on the other hand funding is difficult because al- most everyone believes that either Smithsonian has a large ongoing funding base, or that Smithsonian can always get funding. Unfortunately neither is true." Hampered by funding problems, the planners had to scale back on the opening ceremony, as well as on educa- tional and cultural events. The Dubreuils left Washington a year before the opening. The bad luck did not end there. Though several American museums considered taking the show, in the end none did. The overseas tour died as well. Museums of contemporary art in Japan, according to Fitzhugh, were reluctant to showcase materials typically associated with traditional handicraft, or mingei, exhibi- tions. On the other hand, ethnographic museums balked at the modem art. In essence, he discovered that if it went to Japan, it would have to be substantially modified. Fitzhugh reflected on the difficulty of "marketing" such an exhibition in this day and age. With museums increas- ingly dependent on large traveling exhibitions to generate revenues, he offered the opinion that "serious" shows like Ainu: Spirit ofa Northern People are viewed in the main as costly "niche-fillers." Complicating matters still further, a market survey indicated that American audiences knew lit- tle, if anything, of the Ainu and responded favorably to the proposal only when presented with a title like "Bear-keep- ers of Northern Japan." Museums have been criticized, fairly or otherwise, as is- lands of elitist privilege and curatorial arrogance. As such, they have attracted controversy over minority access and representation, repatriation, and other important issues. What many critics fail to appreciate are the institutional constraints and behind-the-scenes pressures felt by exhibi- tion committees. On the one hand, curators are obliged to work closely with administrators and planning committees who make funding decisions and with educators and de- signers who often have a significant hand in shaping the in- terpretation. On the other, they must be sensitive, as never before, to the concerns of those being represented. The Ainu exhibition, Fitzhugh candidly admits, raised impor- tant, perhaps unresolvable questions. How, for instance, might he have better involved members of the Ainu com- munity in the original conception of the exhibition, one that started with a collections survey? And if community activists felt the scholars were co-opting the show, how then should he have accommodated those scholars who felt that the Dubreuils' inclusion took away some of their authority? In a more perfect world where money flows freely and politics are set aside, it is easy to imagine that events might have played out differently. Fitzhugh's preference would have been to emphasize more the issue of cultural sur- vival-an issue that resonates in many corners of the globe. The Ainu, he notes, have begun to forge relation- ships with indigenous peoples in such diverse locations as Australia, Finland, and North America. Indeed, in "Ainu:</page><page sequence="6">882 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST * VOL. 102, No. 4 * DECEMBER 2000 The Anatomy of an Exhibit," he writes of the obvious par- allels between their historical experience and that of Native Americans: "Starting around 600 years ago, Japanese overwhelmed the Ainu region through conquest. Today the type of relationship the Japanese have with the Ainu is similar to the balance that exists between the dominant population and the indigenous peoples of North America." Yet despite their difficult history and the fact that their so- ciety continues to change and evolve, the Ainu, he said, "have a core of cultural stability, an identity that they are determined to pass along to their children." Perhaps not the success of Crossroads of Continents, which in various forms has enjoyed an extended tour on both sides of the Pacific, Ainu: Spirit of a Northern People nevertheless has its champions. Kazuyoshi Ohtsuka, a cu- rator at the National Museum of Ethnology in Osaka and an early consultant on the project, explained to me that for him, the Smithsonian show offered up a "crucial," though seldom-heard message about the resilience and continuity of his country's indigenous population. Those Ainu who participated in the opening ceremony, he added, were greatly encouraged by the undertaking. I personally spent many hours in the exhibition over the course of several months, each time absorbing a bit more about Ainu history and culture. A surprising number of Japanese tourists came to see it and, like I did, lingered over the extraordinary objects and photographs. It is to be hoped, therefore, that we will see more exhibi- tions focusing on this rich northern culture in the not-too- distant future.
