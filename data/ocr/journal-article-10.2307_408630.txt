<plain_text><page sequence="1">SABINE HAKE University of Pittsburgh Urban Paranoia in Alfred Doblin's Berlin Alexanderplatz In an unpublished prologue to Berlin Alexanderplatz, Alfred Doblin makes the following distinction: "Es gibt zwei Wege auf dieser Welt: einen sichtbaren und einen unsichtbaren" (Prangel26).1 It is primarily through visual and aural perception--dis- tinctly human faculties, in other words-- that Doblin's most famous work recon- structs the metropolis as the production site of the modern mass individual or, to use a more accurate term, the post-humanist subject.2 Traditional oppositions dissolve in its presence, and just as Biberkopf cannot be contained within the dichotomy of in- dividual and society, the theorizing of the city-text must move beyond the alterna- tives of the city as mise-en-schne and nar- rator/protagonist. Through the metaphor of the body, the city becomes accessible to the formal strategies of montage, and the recourse to myth makes possible a critical simulation of modernity. The following reading seeks to analyze this collapsing of opposites, and to reveal the urban as a con- struction that needs an Other not only in order to develop its characteristics, but to become a visual, narrative, and critical agency in the first place. The urban, Imain- tain, generates the irreconcilable differ- ences--organism vs. machine, myth vs. modernity-that it erases in the very mo- ment of self-engendering. By constructing a new subjectivity out- side the oedipal mold, Berlin Alexander- platz abandons the project of narration for the simulation ofurban experience through visual and aural perception. To be under- stood not in the Benjaminian sense of Er- fahrung, lived experience, but in the per- ceptional context of Erlebnis, experience in Doblin is a highly physical process. Thus, the simulation of the urban takes place through the protagonist's paranoid con- sciousness and turns his body into a battle- ground of modernity. Urban paranoia dis- solves the boundaries that protect the bourgeois individual from outside stimuli, and replaces the mechanisms of division with a more volatile system of projections and identifications. Calling Doblin's novel a paranoid text, however, would only im- pose another totalizing structure onto a conglomerate of discourses characterized precisely by a lack of integration. For while the city passages document the conflation, if not confusion, of perception and urban reality, the narrative resists the decenter- ing forces of the metropolis by turning the aesthetics of fragmentation into a tool for reproducing totality on a higher level. The narratoruses the disintegration ofthe main protagonist to exercise his own degree of authority and controL Consequently, the paranoia that organizes the urban text must be examined on two levels: as a de- limiting and scrambling of discourses and as a disruptive force within the narrative that needs to be contained. Here, Doblin's critical writings on urbanism and the mod- em individual offer a useful reference point for mapping this complicated dynamic of resistance and surrender, and for linking it to psychoanalytic theories of the subject that find their most radical articulation in Deleuze and Guattari's writings on para- noia. In addition, their conceptualization of The German Quarterly 67.3 (Summer 1994) 347</page><page sequence="2">348 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Summer 1994 the rhizome will be used as a nonlinear, nonhierarchical model for walking in the city and writing the text of the urban. However, any study of the textual ar- ticulations of urban subjectivity needs to be preceded by a more basic investigation into whether Berlin Alexanderplatz represents a city novel--or a Berlin novel, for that mat- ter-in the traditional sense and, if not, how the city defies narratability and how Doblin's literary simulation of the urban threatens existing models of repre- sentation. From the beginning, his novel was perceived as a challenge to the narra- tive project itself. Contemporary reviewers praised the work as the first novel in which Berlin appeared at once as the narrator and the subject of narration. The remark by one contemporary reviewer that "Alexander- platz ist ebenso sehr eine steinerne wie seelische Landschaft" (quoted in Schuster and Bode 238) describes this double provo- cation with all its hidden implications. While differing in their evaluation of the novel's formal qualities, and while arguing about its political message, most reviewers agreed that Berlin Alexanderplatz contin- ued the tradition of the great 19th-century city novel (Dickens, Balzac) and should be grouped with other modernist reconstruc- tions of the city like James Joyce's Ulysses (1922) or John Dos Passos's Manhattan Transfer (1925). Joyce was called a major source of inspiration for D6blin's stream of consciousness, whereas Don Passos and Doblin invited comparisons because of their experiments with simultaneity.3 Yet, no matter whether critics welcomed Doblin's use of montage as innovative or rejected his description of the neighborhood around Alexanderplatz as tendentious, the urban text was read within the framework ofrep- resentability, with the actual city as the ul- timate standard of judgment. No matter whether montage was praised as anexpres- sion of urban chaos, or seen as part of an extended system of correspondences, Ber- lin provided the reference point through which the crisis of the novel could suppos- edly be articulated and overcome. In all cases, the fascination with the colorful mi- lieu and the praise for the formal solutions distracted from the more disquieting possi- bility that the representation of the city could no longer be accomplished within a modernist framework, that the experience of the urban had to be theorized outside of representational categories. Not surprisingly, two contradictory as- sumptions dominate the critical writings onBerlinAlexanderplatz as a city novel: the assumption that Doblin remains commit- ted to mimetic representation, despite or because of his reliance on montage, and the assumption that the city must be read as a metaphor of modernity, in spite of his at- tention to local color. Accordingly, some crit- ics have focused on the portrayal of the city without acknowledgingitsphantasmagoric quality, while others have discussed its metaphorical status without taking into ac- count the specificity of locations. Often, the equation of the big city with crisis and de- cline has more to do with antiurban preju- dices than with critical astuteness. At other times, the city is treated as an agent of social change, and associated with terms like alienation, fragmentation, and de-indi- vidualization. Such approaches tend to re- duce the complexity of urban phenomena to social explanations, and prevent an un- derstanding of the dynamic between op- pression and liberation that makes the en- counter with the city such an exhilarating experience.4 By conflating social and archi- tectonic space, and by translating the vari- ous aspects of the urban into the metaphys- ics of the self and the pathology of mass society, they often end up reading the novel against the grain of its own radicality. To recognize this process of sedimenta- tion in the critical reception of the work is crucial for an understanding of the very similar process of sedimentation in the writing of the urban text itself. Already the opposition set up in the novel's full title be- tween the description of aplace--the center of the old eastern part of the city, a subway</page><page sequence="3">HAKE: Doblin 349 station under construction-and the story of the main protagonist-the former ce- ment worker and pimp Franz Biberkopf-- establishes a structural relationship and an interpretative framework for the narra- tive. On the one hand, the almost deadly fight between city and protagonist that gives the novel its three-part structure, and creates a dense network of leitmotifs, sum- mons for one last time the main elements of bourgeois individualism, but quickly moves on to demonstrate the failure ofthese oppositional categories in confrontation with a more diffuse and dispersed field of forces. On the other hand, the subtitle "Die Geschichte vom Franz Biberkopf"-pro- posed by the publisher to make the novel's theme more accessible-imposes a linear order on the spatial coordinates of "Berlin Alexanderplatz" and replaces its multi- plicity of relations with the oppositional structure of the traditional epic. That this opposition is put into crisis and, ultimately, dissolved has been pointed out in more re- cent contributions that radically challenge the narratability of the city within a mod- ernist framework (Scherpe) or rely on post- structuralist definitions of subjectivity (Freisfeld) and textuality (Jlihner) to intro- duce most suitable categories ofinterpreta- tion such as dissemination and decenter- ing. Questioning the distinctions between perception and reality and between interior and exterior space, post-structuralist thought has thus opened up a space for in- terpretations in which subjectivity and ur- banity need no longer be seen as antagonis- tic and mutually exclusive. These conflicting readings draw atten- tion to the instability of discourses pro- duced by, and attributed to, the metropolis and bring into focus the contested status of experience in modem city narratives. In works like Berlin Alexanderplatz, where the complexity of urban life has exploded poetic convention and severed all ties to the literary past, the city stakes its claims as a topos without clearly defined boundaries and with uncertain epistemological status. Involved in the reconstruction of a specific place and social environment, the modem city novel approaches the project of repre- sentation by means of a struggle between individual and city, yet does no longer be- lieve in the concept of struggle or the pos- sibility of representation. It takes part in the negotiation of power, defining its liter- ary means in accordance with, or resistance to, dominant practices, but fails to produce a meta-discourse that would salvage the project on a higher plane. Such constella- tions implicate the city novel (and its critics) in the binary categories that produce these aporias in the first place: hence my sugges- tion to replace the term 'city' with that of 'urbanism' or 'the urban'-terms which re- flect more accurately the delimiting expe- rience of modernity. Recognizing this insta- bility within the urban is essential for a reassessment of the relationship between urbanism and montage. As the most palpa- ble sedimentation of the urban in the text and its textures, montage has to be evalu- ated against the backdrop of that which it obliterates and preserves: the discourse of unity associated with the city as organism. For the same reasons, the affinities with the fragment need to be related to the urban as the construction site of post-humanist consciousness. The shift from representa- tion to experience as the main critical cate- gory thus makes montage an integral part of the urban experience, rather than of specific formal strategies, and it helps to overcome the artificial separation between the real and the imaginary that defines the city novel in the traditional sense. Psychoanalytic theories of the subject provide the means to examine the psychic agencies governing desire, and to shed some light on Doblin's simulation of urban experience and his theorizing of modern subjectivity. His writings bear an uncanny resemblance to Freud's definition of para- noia and its reconceptualization by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari in Anti-Oedi- pus and A Thousand Plateaus. Defying Oedipus in a no less spectacular way,</page><page sequence="4">350 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Summer 1994 Doblin's novel narrates the making of the decentered subject through the figure of a social outsider and his decidedly unsenti- mental education, and it reproduces the ur- ban experience precisely in the void left by the failure of representation. As is the case in paranoia, writing the urban brings forth its own formations of resistance and denial. The images of the city emulate the organic in order to simulate a unity that no longer exists, and mobilize mythology to reclaim its place in history without having any re- course to it. Traditional narrative positions are abandoned under the influence of the big city. But at the same time, the urban text seems to reintroduce narrative author- ity through a metaphysic of the body that unites individual and society in the organ- ism of the archaic collective. The oceanic feeling of delimitation and the more fright- ening experience of disorientation demar- cate the area from which the new urban text emerges. It is held in suspension by the tension between the symptoms of paranoia that erupt in the novel's extended city pas- sages and the vestiges of mythology grafted onto the project of modernity and aligned with a more precarious kind of individual- ism. If one wanted to describe the emergence of the urban subject in psychoanalytic terms, one would have to speak of a gradual dismantling of the oedipal structure and its replacement by an all-encompassing, but highly volatile, narcissistic complex. Its ef- fect can be measured by the flights into paranoia through which the main pro- tagonist tries to resist this process, thereby actually accelerating it. In "Psychoanalytic Notes on an Autobiographical Account of a Case of Paranoia," the famous Schreber case, Freud defines paranoia as a distur- bance in the movement from autoeroticism to object choice (1974, 12: 14-78). Once a drive cannot be integrated properly, libido is withdrawn from the loved object, result- ing in repression, but also paving the way for the return of the repressed-but now, as an impulse from the outside. Projection, in short, helps to justify the original emo- tional investment. But unlike neurosis, paranoia refuses to give up desire. And un- like hysteria, which relies on condensation, paranoia advances through dissections or, rather, the disseminating of all existing identifications. Ultimately, its formations offantasy, delirium, and madness are noth- ing but a process of returning, of repeating, of representing. The importance of paranoia for modern subjectivity has been argued by Deleuze and Guattari in their project on schizoanal- ysis that started with Anti-Oedipus, but that might have found literary precursors not only in frequently mentioned authors like Kleist and Kafka, but in Doblin as well Deleuze and Guattari describe how para- noia challenges notions such as identity, subject-object, or experience and, in so do- ing, provides an alternative model of writ- ing across boundaries. Questioning its uni- versal validity, the critics of psychoanalysis link the Oedipus complex to the repression of what they call desiring-machines. The schizophrenic, by experiencing nature as a production, draws attention to the fact that "everything is production: production of productions, of actions and of passions; pro- ductions of recording processes, of distribu- tions and of co-ordinates that serve as points of reference; productions of con- sumptions, of sensual pleasures, of anxi- eties, and of pain" (Deleuze and Guattari 1983, 4). In the place of a false man-nature dichotomy, Deleuze and Guattariintroduce real and imaginary machines that engage in endless coupling and uncoupling. These desiring-machines can best be studied in the moment of breakdown, collapse, mal- functioning. Traces of such decidedly anti- humanist thinking are already present in Diiblin's writings on the philosophy of na- ture. Despite the existentialist terminology, and despite the assumption of afundamen- tal harmony between self and world, his thoughts on identity formation fall into the abyss of their own desire for a new mythol- ogy and give birth to visions of mechaniza-</page><page sequence="5">HAKE: Diblin 351 tion that, in many ways, prefigure Deleuze and Guattari's desiring-machines. Without a center, Doblin's city body suddenly turns into a machine or, rather, a conglomerate of machines. This is how he describes "die- ses wiste Durcheinander von Organen" which make up the human body: "Es ist fabelhaft, womit dieser Apparat versehen ist. Es ist eine ganze Fabrik, eine Uber- fabrik, ein Brutschrank, ein Automat, eine Serie von Automaten, ein Konzern. In was fir eine Gesellschaft bin ich geraten" (Doblin 1964, 20). But just as Biberkopfs initial encounter with Berlin represents less an example of victimization than of willful resistance-hubris, in classical terms--the equation of man and machine implies a submission to the machine aes- thetics that is both frightening and liberat- ing. Of greatest significance to the practice of writing, the discourse of subjectivity and of writing as discourse come together in the image of the rhizome, defined in botanical terms as a "somewhat elongate and usually horizontal subterranean plant stem that is often thickened by deposits of reserve food material, produces shoots above and roots below, and is distinguished from a true root in possessing buds, nodes, and usually scalelike leaves" (Webster'sDictionary). The rhizome demonstrates a new strategy of textual and discursive advancement, link- ing together Biberkopfs aimless walking, the nonlinear structure of the narrative, and the introduction of different voices into the city text. Its various aspects can be used to outline a model of the urban that pre- cisely defies traditional categories: through the rejection oflinearity, hierarchy, and uni- formity; the insistence on diversity and het- erogeneity; and the attention to process and change. Thus, as a way ofbeginning (again), and before identifying some of the "paranoid" structures in Doblin's philosophy of nature, I take Deleuze and Guattari's observation to heart that a "schizophrenic out for a walk is a better model than a neurotic lying on the analyst's couch" (1983, 2)-and who would be a better witness to the enormous productivity of paranoia (or schizophrenia, as it is also called) than Franz Biberkopf? So, without further ado, let us follow him onhis walks throughBerlinAlexanderplatz and witness how another kind of urban text-the text of urban paranoia-is being written on the ruins of the old narrative project. Doblin's novel opens onto two re- curring images, the falling roofs and the pile driver, that become part of the city body through their ability to incorporate and spread desire across the textual surface. Like leitmotifs, these moving objects pro- vide points of intersection between story line and narrative space and translate the biography of Franz Biberkopf into the ur- ban geography of Berlin. Each is associated with a particular sense: the roof, with the sense of vision, and the pile driver, with the sense of hearing. It is the ancient discourse of biomorphism now adapted to the world of desiring-machines that, by establishing a connection between houses and human bodies, and by equating the roof with the head, makes the falling roofs an indicator ofBiberkopfs struggle for survival and self- determination.5 For the same reasons, the pile driver becomes the city's heart, with its rhythmical pounding a constant reminder of the repressed urges under the smooth exterior of social convention. Through the juxtaposition of rooftops and pile driver, a vertical structure is established that lo- cates the city's vital center underground- subterranean as well as subconscious- and makes the subway construction on Alexanderplatz the site of a perpetual in- vasion, unearthing, violation. It is into this real and imaginary space that the destabi- lizing forces of desire and the gaze enter in order to expand the self and, given their implication in the crisis of urban repre- sentation, to accelerate the metaphorical circle of city as body as city, until it turns into its opposite: the city as montage, as- semblage, and, to use the term introduced by Deleuze and Guattari, as desiring-ma-</page><page sequence="6">352 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Summer 1994 chine. All these destabilizing moves--from perception to delusion, from description to simulation--come together in several long explorations of Alexanderplatz, which through the discourse, quite literally, of walking is conquered and transformed into a construction site of the post-humanist subject. The falling roofs appear for the first time when Franz Biberkopfleaves jail and finds himself confronted with a very changed city: "Und Daicher waren auf den Ha usern, die schwebten auf den Hausern, seine Augen irrten nach oben: wenn die Dicher nur nicht abrutschten, aber die Haiuser standengerade"(Doblin 1961, 15; hereafter BA). From then on, his relationship to Ber- lin vacillates between identification with the city's strength and projection of his anxieties onto the urban landscape. While the memory of past traumas forces the man's glance upward, the reassuringimage of permanence found in the outside world provides a temporary support structure for his free-floating emotions. Yet identity for- mation and urban experience are not sim- ply interrelated or interdependent; Doblin sets out to prove that they are constitutive of each other. The opposition between char- acter and milieu or, to phrase it in more conceptual terms, between biography and topography, can no longer be articulated within the confines of the modern city novel and its radically different approach to the spatiality of the subject and the subjectivity of space; the remnants of a vernacular of conflict and confrontation only highlight this dilemma. The struggle between city and main protagonist, so often mentioned in the secondary literature, is invoked but not realized; the oppositional structure has been replaced by a more flexible, dynamic configuration.6 Here, the coupling of city and self produces an illusionary sense of control the necessity of which is demon- strated later by the double containment of the falling roofs within parentheses in an inner monologue: "Kein Haiusereinstiirzen, kein Dicherrutschen, das liegt hinter uns, Ein Fmir Allemal Hinter Uns" (BA 126). Be- cause the nonidentity of image and percep- tion prevents a realistic or naturalistic re- construction of the city, the stream of consciousness of the main protagonist re- mains suspended between the no-longer and the not-yet. And because the urban ex- perience is inextricably linked to the ephemeral and the myth of presence, the actual city must disappear in the back- ground in order to serve as a catalyst and projection screen. Even Biberkopfs leisurely stroll through MuinzstraBe fails to generate the kind of critical or enthusiastic observations found in other contemporary Berlin novels. Instead, buildings and architectural details are summoned to rehearse their own oblit- eration, with Biberkopf turning to increas- ingly more fragile elements such as window panes in his desperate search for stability: Aber dann glitten seine Blicke im Ruck die Hiuserfronten hoch, pr(iften die HAu- serfronten, versicherten sich, daI3 sie still- standen und sich nicht regten, trotzdem eigentlich so ein Haus viele Fenster hat und sich leicht vorniiber beugen kann. Das kann auf die Daicher iibergehen, die D icher mit sich ziehen; sie krnnen schwanken. Zu schwanken konnen sie an- fangen, zu schaukeln, zu schiitteln. Rut- schen kannen die Daicher, wie Sand schriig herunter, wie ein Hut vom Kopf. (BA 140) This moment brings the sudden recognition that it is indeed the look which starts the process of dissolution, as evidenced by the transformation ofthe mostdurable material, stone, into the apotheosis of volatility and impermanence, sand. Consequently, after the second fatal blow, the accident that leaves Biberkopf crippled, the buildings no longer hold and the sounds of collapse bring back repressed memories: "Die Hijuser, die rutschenden Dicher, einhoherfinsterer Hof, es braust ein Rufwie Donnerhall, juvivaller- allera, so hat es angefangene" (BA 246). His subsequent denial of the traumatic experi-</page><page sequence="7">HAKE: Dablin 353 ence-"und keiner weiB oder redet davon, da3 inzwischen die Hiiusergewackelt haben und die Daicher wollten abrutschen" (BA 250)--may restore the houses to their origi- nal splendor but also deprives them of all life and turns them into ruins ofthe unconscious. When Biberkopf later reenters the city, "die HIiuser stehen still, der Wind weht wo er will. Eiwarum, eidarum, ei bloB wegen dem 'Tschingdaradada" (BA 320). Only pieces of a children's song attest to the progressive dissociation of subjectivity. Experience has been reduced to rhyme, as evidenced by the succession of"still" and "will," and the prom- ise of desires fulfilled has taken refuge in an absurd refrain. Although it is only in the fragments of a song that the old rules of de- marcation survive, the new urban subject has to silence those melodies, too, in order to establish a clear and distanced relationship to the city-without the trials faced by the ideal-typical bourgeois in gaining self-con- sciousness and personal autonomy, and out- side of the bouts of madness through which the old Biberkopf tried to hold on to his de- sires. Thus, in a rather ambiguous (and oddly defeatist) ending, the novel extols the virtues of modesty instead of tragic heroism and celebrates the collective as the true home for the homeless modern individual. "Die Hiiuser halten still, die Daicher liegen fest, er kann sich ruhig unter ihnen bewegen, er braucht in keine dunklen Hofe zu kriechen. Ja, dieser Mann-wir wollen ihn Franz Karl Biberkopf nennen, um ihn von dem ersten zu unterscheiden" (BA 493)--he walks slowly, looks calmly: he is back again. A similar leitmotif structure forms around the pile driver at the construction site on Alexanderplatz. Like the falling roofs, its presence is mediated through the perceptions of the main protagonist and serves similar psychic functions. It facili- tates the projection of unconscious drives onto a violated earth and invites identifica- tion with the urban rhythm and its hidden strength. The hypnoticpounding of the pile driver is first heard during the second tra- versing of the city's central square: "Rumm rumm wuchtet vor Aschinger auf dem Alex die Dampframme. Sie ist ein Stock hoch, und die Schienen haut sie wie nichts in den Boden . . . Rumm rumm haut die Dampframme auf dem Alexanderplatz" (BA 179). The destruction of the city's old center by modern transportation systems affects even the function of language, up- rooting grammatical convention and con- fusing communicative patterns. The omi- nous machine injects its violent rhythm into human relations and occasions a con- jugation of "Ich schlage alles, du schligst alles, er schliigt alles" (BA 180). This gram- matical exercise, in turn, establishes the conditions for the more disturbing shift from an identification with violence-"Ich zerschlage alles, du zerschliigst alles, er zerschlAgt alles" (BA 180)-to a projection of these impulses onto the site of urban production: "Rumm rumm ratscht die Ramme nieder, ich schlage alles, noch eine Schiene" (BA 183). The importance of the pile driver in these changing configurations resides in its being a symbol of life and death. On the one hand, it dictates the ur- ban rhythm that, like the beating of the heart, guarantees the survival of, and in, the city. On the other hand, the pile driver articulates the all-pervasive violence link- ing institutions like the prison and the in- sane asylum to the highly suggestive slaughterhouse scene. While the pile driver, as image and object, visualizes the conflicts in modern life, its narrative function con- sists precisely in uniting the disparate ele- ments of the urban. As figures of mediation, the pile driver and the falling roofs establish a system of universal correspondences, dissolving the distinction between the individual and the masses and overcoming fragmentation through what could either be dismissed as repetition compulsion or welcomed as auni- versalism rooted in modern myth. When the pounding of the pile driver is temporar- ily silenced by the winds over Alexander- platz, sound turns into noise, and noise tri- umphs as the original language of human</page><page sequence="8">354 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Summer 1994 suffering. A later hallucination of destruc- tion and the brutality of urban life empha- sizes the similarities between wind, breath, noise, and voice. It begins with the asser- tion: "Der Wind macht nichts weiter als seine Brust ein bil3chen weit" (BA388), only to deteriorate into mere (erotic) stammer- ing: "Ich bin deine, komm doch, wir sind bald da, ich bin deine. Wumm wumm" (BA 389). The winds of destruction return once more in the epiphany of madness during Biberkopfs stay at the Buch asylum. Ves- tiges of speech initially surface in the equa- tion of wind and breath: "Wumm wumm, der Wind macht seine Brust weit, er zieht den Atem ein" (BA 462f.). But soon the cen- ter of attention shifts from the physical body to sound hallucinations that an- nounce the appearance of the Whore Baby- lon and complete the man's demontage: "Wumm Schlag, wumm Schlag, wumm Sturmbock, wumm Torschlag. Wuchten und Rammen, Krachen und Schwingen. Wer ist denn dieser verlogene Kerl, Franz Biberkopf (BA 466). The hammering with which society makes its claims on the indi- vidual recalls the demands of technology symbolized by the pile driver and seals the protagonist's auditory entrapment in one final outburst of paranoia. With the en- trance of the new Biberkopf, however, these voices are silenced, and the construction site on Alexanderplatz is again nothing but a monument to technological progress. Just as the mass individual becomes a subject without voice, the city turns into a voice without subject. But as a sound body, so to speak, it continues to govern the relation- ships between sender and receiver, lan- guage and noise; hence Benjamin's insight- ful characterization of Dbblin's city as the narrator's megaphone (3: 233). Through these two leitmotifs, the falling roofs and the pile driver, Alexanderplatz triumphs as a primal scene of modernity.7 The streets that converge on Alexander- platz-Frankfurter Allee, Landsberger StraBle, TurmstraB3e, Klosterstrafle, Brun- nenstral3e-make it the center of the neigh- borhood where Biberkopf and his friends lead wretched lives. By setting the story in a predominantly working-class neighbor- hood, Doblin takes advantage of his famili- arity with that milieu. More important still, he extends the formal experimentation of the modern novel to a social group typically associated with realist or naturalist per- spectives. In the characters from the lum- penproletariat, the crisis of bourgeois in- dividualism becomes glaringly obvious, because their belief in self-advancement, detached from any economical possibilities, remains an illusion. Among the social out- casts and foreigners, the qualities of urban mass society come into sharper focus, given the absence of any ideological support structures. That destabilizing effect in the choice of milieu is reduplicated in the pro- visional nature of the square itself. Within the new spatial order of Weimar Berlin, Alexanderplatz is marginalized as a result of the westward expansion of business and capital, and therefore under pressure to adopt to the exigencies of modern consumer culture. Such subtexts make its narrative reconstruction eminently suitable for an examination of the process of decentering and the theorizing of modern subjectivity. Through its double role as center (i.e., of the narrative) and epicenter (i.e., ofthe city, of bourgeois society), Alexanderplatz also foregrounds the problem of authorship. As- suming the position of omniscient narrator, Doblin accompanies Biberkopf on his ex- cursions into hostile territory and sepa- rates from the main protagonist to scruti- nize the square from a position of absolute authority and control. The narrator's al- most ritualistic naming of streets (and, later, of streetcars) conveys a sense of sta- bility and permanence, as does the intro- duction of classificatory systems. While the spatial layout of the city accommodates the need for linguistic order, the more volatile world of commerce and trade produces the opposite effect: it draws attention to the transitoriness of all urban phenomena. Thus, the stores and restaurants are di-</page><page sequence="9">HAKE: D6blin 355 vided into two categories, those that have survived and those that have been sacri- ficed to the demands of urban renewal. On the textual surface, nothing distinguishes the former, which include the well-known Wertheim and Tietz department stores and the SchloBlbriu and Aschinger restaurants, from the latter, which count amongits casu- alties the popular Berolina statue as well as the Loeser &amp; Wolff tobacco shop and the Jiirgens stationery store. However, the very fact of their disappearance highlights the contested nature of public places and their precarious position at the intersection of modernity and what suddenly returns as myth, revealing the underside of progress. To what degree the experience of change calls on the ghosts of antiquity can be seen in the description of the vacant Friedrich Hahn department store as leergemacht, ausgeriumt und ausgewei- det, daB nur die roten Fetzen noch an den Schaufenstern kleben. Ein Miillhaufen liegt vor uns. Von Erde bist du gekommen, zu Erde sollst du wieder werden, wir ha- ben gebauet ein herrliches Haus, nun geht hier kein Mensch weder rein noch raus. So ist kaputt Rom, Babylon, Ninive, Hanni- bal, Cisar, alles kaputt, oh, denkt daran. Erstens habe ich dazu zu bemerken, daB3 man diese St~idtejetzt wieder ausgrfibt... (BA 181f.). The connection, finally, between the modern ruins of consumer culture and the catastro- phes of history is established by the main protagonist in this scene of willful destruc- tion, the modern city-dwellers, who repre- sent the third element in the geographic and historical topography of Alexanderplatz. While the streets and buildings provide the structure, the people act out the relation- ships between its discrete elements and in- troduce movement and transitoriness into the static order of stone. As witnesses of that difference, the passers-by are shown in vari- ous activities such as standing, walking, running, strolling on the sidewalk, entering and exiting stores, glancing into shop win- dows, crossing the street, riding on the bus or streetcar. When depicted from afar, they appearlike a swarm ofbees, thus also raising the specter of mass society. At other times, persons are identified by name and given a biography--with the result that the narra- tive perspective, too, shifts from the collec- tive to the individual and from the public to the private sphere. Both positions, the aerial view and the close-up (if one wanted to use filmic terms), associate human beings with process, be it through comparisons to nature (e.g., the water metaphors) or through their social attributes (e.g., the markers of class and gender). While the individual descrip- tions suggest an experience of confusing multitudes, if not ofchaos, the multiperspec- tivism forces the place and its inhabitants into a unified whole and confirms diversity as the underlying principle of another kind of urban experience. In that it organizes the disparate ele- ments of the urban, the Alexanderplatz passage serves as a model for the novel's own construction. It fulfills this self-reflex- ive function by providing a stand-in for the narrator in the figure of the traffic police- man who conducts the flows of traffic and pedestrians with confidence. By orchestrat- ing, rather than directing, the stream of vehicles and pedestrians, his structuring presence gives meaning to the diversity of positions and perspectives: Die Schupo beherrscht gewaltig den Platz.

Scharfist der Schupo auf Taille gearbeitet Aufseinen erfolgten Ruck laufen iber den Platz in Richtung K6nigstrale etwa 30 private Personen, sie</page><page sequence="10">356 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Summer 1994 halten zum Teil aufder Schutzinsel, einTeil erreicht glatt die Gegenseite und wandert auf Holz weiter. Ebenso viele haben sich nach Osten aufgemacht, sie sind den an- dern entgegengeschwommen, es ist ihnen ebenso gegangen, aber keinem ist was pas- siert. (BA 182) Through the depersonalization of the Schupo, the question of authorship is sepa- rated from considerations of intentionality and expressivity. In their place, a new model for organizing disparate materials is introduced, one that upholds the belief in centrality but also submits to outside im- pulses with appreciation and self-irony, as is indicated by the reference to the Schupo's connoisseur's glance. Accordingly, writing the urban text requires both a willing sur- render to the heterogeneous material-- through montage techniques or stream of consciousness-and an ability to organize sheer quantity into meaningful entities. Whereas the Schupo on Alexanderplatz possesses the skills required for such a task, the challenges to the narrator seem insur- mountable. Referring to the passengers on a streetcar, he expresses doubts: "Was in ihnen vorgeht, wer kann das ermitteln, ein ungeheures Kapitel. Und wenn man es tAte, wem diente es? Neue BUcher? Schon die alten gehen nicht" (BA 183). The city confronts the modem writer with a double task: to explore new subject matter and new formal strategies while at the same time changing the role of literature in society. Obviously, these difficulties of deciphering the urban scene are directly related to the marginality of literature in modern mass society. Even the simplicity of a bus sched- ule no longer gives certainty, and the mys- terious tokens in the passengers' hands no longer divulge any secrets. The mapping ofAlexanderplatz in what must be considered one of the novel's cen- tral chapters is placed between two other passages that consciously place the vio- lence of the demolition work within the flow ofurban life. The first time when Biberkopf sees the square after the release from prison, he reacts with indifference: Am Alexanderplatz reilen sie den Damm auf flir die Untergrundbahn. Man geht auf Brettern. Die Elektrischen fahren iiber den Platz die Alexanderstrale her- auf durch die MiinzstraBe zum Rosen- thaler Tor. Rechts und links sind StraBen. In den Stra3en steht Haus bei Haus. Die sind von Keller bis zum Boden mit Men- schen voll. Unten sind die LIiden. (BA 131) As the underground construction eliminates the foundation on which the narrator nor- mally stands, the structures supporting the urban narrative disappear as well The lack of a center that could establish hierarchies between diverse elements, orcreate relation- ships of cause and effect, forces the narrator to turn to serialization and classification as the only strategies left to portray the city as a meaningful place. The third traversing of Alexanderplatz confirms the diagnosis of dissociation, but, in light of Biberkopfs own transformation, the pervasive sense of alienation in the ear- lier examples gives way to an almost frantic insistence on factuality. Hence, the tone is one of descriptive objectivity: Am Alexanderplatz murksen und murk- sen sie weiter. In der Konigstra3e Ecke Neue FriedrichstraBe wollen sie Oiber dem Schuhhaus Salamander das Haus abrei- Ben, daneben das brechen sie schon ab. Die Fahrt unter dem Stadtbahnbogen Alex wird enorm schwierig: es werden neue Pfeiler ffir die Eisenbahnbrnicke ein- gebaut; man kann da heruntersehen in ei- nen schon ausgemauerten Schacht, wo die Pfeiler ihre Fii3e hinsetzen. (BA 333) There is a noticeable shift in agency, as ar- ticulated in the pronoun'sie," from the listing of commercial buildings in Biberkopfs first encounter with Alexanderplatz to his final acknowledgment of the construction work- ers tearing them down. As a comment on the protagonist's difficult educational journey, that change could be interpreted as a sign of his gradual acceptance of the workingcollec-</page><page sequence="11">HAKE: Doblin 357 tive; the sudden reference to "man" supports such a claim. However, Biberkopfs fourth and last re- turn to Alexanderplatz after his release from the insane asylum takes place under very different conditions. Now, it is the ob- sessive appeal to a reality freed of experi- ence that keeps the images in check and prevents any one element from dominating, be it the pounding of the pile driver or the naming of stores: Zuerst der Alex. Den gibts noch immer. Zu sehen ist an dem nichts, war ja eine furchtbare Kaite den ganzen Winter, da haben sie nicht gearbeitet und alles ste- hen gelassen, wie es stand, die groie Ram- me steht jetzt am Georgenkirchplatz, da buddeln sie den Schutt vom Kaufhaus Hahn aus, viele Schienen haben sie da eingekloppt, vielleicht wirds ein Bahnhof. Und auch sonst ist viel los am Alex, aber Hauptsache: er ist da. (BA 494) Once the hallucinations of movement have stopped (i.e., the falling roofs), and the sounds been contained (Le., the pile driver), Alexanderplatz no longerfunctions as anin- strument of identity formation or a projec- tion screen for repressed desires. Now, the square stands out through an almost un- canny presence-to-itself. The details of ar- chitecture and construction are made super- fluous by the admission of a ubiquitous uncertainty, and the signs of change are relativized by the recognition of their ulti- mate irrelevance. Such a conclusion is reas- suring in its acceptance of the reality princi- ple, but disturbing in its dependence on a paranoid consciousness that now, under the disguise of normalcy, seeks to contain all signs ofinstability in a frighteningly success- ful attempt to prevent the dissemination of the individual's desire into the city's imagi- nary spaces. These, then, are the conditions under which the protagonist and the narrator ap- proach the conquest ofBerlin. Both respond to the challenges of the city with movement, but while they frequently walk together, the narrator clearly has more powerful means at his request. Walking sets the pace for his exploration of the city, structures the major events in the story, and informs nar- rative structures and motifs. It is always one initial idea that sets the writing process into motion, Doblin argues, thus using walking and its "step by step" method as a model of narrative advancement. Linear as well as circular, aimless as well as purpose- ful, self-determined as well as outer-di- rected, the discourse of walking reconciles the exigencies of storytelling with the living conditions in the modern metropolis. The original idea for the novel and its opening chapter rely precisely on such movements. D6blin noted during the early writing stage that "in meinem Roman jetzt aus Berlin weiB ich zunichst nur: der Mann will aus dem Tegeler Gefiingnis nach Berlin; also flihrt er eben hin; was sich dann ergibt,- dazu bedarf es weiterer Einfhille, die wie- derum eine Zeit weiter tragen7 (1989, 215). Elsewhere, he characterizes reading in similar terms: "Der Leser, allein gelassen, mu8 durch wirkliche Stra3en gehen, in denen er sich zu orientieren, zurechtzufin- den hat" (quoted by Miiller-Salget 108). In Berlin Alexanderplatz, narrator and reader have a perfect instrument in the main pro- tagonist whose movements through the city confirm walking as an important nar- rative strategy, the unifying force behind the appearance of simultaneity and diver- sity. Some critics have pointed out that Biberkopf also uses streetcars and buses (Scholvin 98-105). However, this more con- temporary form of transportation does not introduce a radically different mode of per- ception or facilitate different kinds of en- counters. The fleeting sounds and images are in both cases processed through the movements of the narrative agent within a system that itself is in constant flux; and in that shift from sensory perception to free association and critical evaluation, the ur- ban experience materializes. Jaihner rightly calls walking a form of mediation between a subjectivity in crisis and a pow-</page><page sequence="12">358 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Summer 1994 erful, devouring city (38-60). To describe Biberkopfas a flaneur, however, would miss the point. He lacks the sense of self-aware- ness that keeps the typical Weimar flaneur in possession of himself. Above all, the lat- ter rarely succumbs to the danger of losing himself in the object world and the phenom- ena of everyday life. Biberkopfs paranoid consciousness forces him to act out every stage in that process: the impossibility of remaining a subject in the old sense, his unwillingness to surrender to the power of the new, and the encounter with the ener- gies set free in this experience of radical change. The narrator chooses the opposite strategy: he surrenders to the complexity of the city and is therefore able to examine the diverse urban phenomena outside of considerations of time and space and in de- fiance of the traditional rules of narrative coherence and continuity. What distin- guishes him from the flaneur is his ability to leave the established paths and move forward, backward, and sideways; to intro- duce perspectives inherent in the object world, and not his perception thereof; and to move beyond the immediacy of the mo- ment in order to explore those relations of simultaneity, continuity, and cause and ef- fect that give rise to the particular sensa- tions designated as urban or metropolitan. Doblin's skills as a city guide precede his relationship with Franz Biberkopf, and if one wanted to search for elements for a the- ory of urbanism and modern subjectivity, one would have to look more closely at his autobiographical and essayistic writings. They place Berlin Alexanderplatz at the center of an extensive involvement with ur- ban phenomena and illuminate the novel's critical project from the side of personal experience and philosophical thought. Doblin's own life offers a first occasion for articulating discomfort with the conven- tions that separate the self and the world. Time and again, he presents himself as the quintessential city dweller who depends on the city for inspiration and resonance. "Es gibt zu sehen, zu hbren, zu riechen" (1986, 219), he exclaims during a walk through Old Berlin. The negative sides of city life only strengthen a relationship that thrives on tensions and ambivalences. Not surpris- ingly, D6blin retells his arrival as a ten- year-old Jewish boy from Stettin as a being born for the second time or, rather, as a giving birth to himself (1986, 110f.). That moment of self-engendering is inextricably linked to the characterization of Berlin as a place of constant change rather than con- tinuity, of work rather than leisure, and of sobriety rather than imagination. In this city where opposites clash with unprece- dented intensity, and where the integration of all elements can no longer be achieved, Doblin finds a perfect testing ground forhis theory of epic writing that accompanies his urban writings from the first short pieces on Berlin neighborhoods to the modernist program of Berlin Alexanderplatz. Re- sponding to a 1922 questionnaire about the influence of the city on his writing, Doblin states emphatically that "diese Erregung der StraBen, Liiden, Wagen ist die Hitze, die ich in mich schlagen lassen mu8, wenn ich arbeite, das heilt: eigentlich immer. Das ist das Benzin, mit dem mein Motor lAuft" (1986, 38). Another questionnaire of 1928 prompts the confession that "ich kann zu Hause, auf der Strale, im Lokal--iiber- all schreiben, aber fast nur in Berlin. Ausw~irts fiihle ich mich gestort" (1986, 179). At times, writing in the city takes on the characteristics of a repetition compul- sion in which the evocation of place betrays a never-ending quest for the city as the site of Doblin's immaculate conception as a writer, hence his admission that "ob ich von China, Indien und Gronland sprach, ich habe immervon Berlingesprochen, von die- sem groBen starken und nuichternen Ber- lin" (quoted in Meyer 214). The spatial divisions that structure Doblin's rewriting of the city, and are repeated in his double life as writer and physician, lay the foun- dation for a new conception of urban space. While rejecting the realist tradition, he chooses easily identifiable places in order</page><page sequence="13">HAKE: Doblin 359 to establish a clear (and, therefore, negli- gible) point of reference, and limits his ex- plorations to the multiethnic and predomi- nantly working-class quarters around Alexanderplatz where he grew up and prac- ticed medicine. Such specificity marks the urban text as a process of ongoing revision and reconfiguration that involves fictional as well as nonfictional works. An earlier Berlin novel, Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (1918), already contains a description of FriedrichstraBle that, as Dollenmayer has pointed out, uses some of the montage techniques perfected in Berlin Alexanderplatz (51). Milieu studies like "Dialog in der MtinzstraB3e" foreshadow Biberkopfs visit to one of the street's sleazy movie theaters after his release from prison. In early excursions through "Altes Berlin" and the region "Ostlich um den Alexanderplatz," the writer assumes the role of a pedestrian trying to explore "die Peripherie dieses miichtigen Wesens" (1962, 60). Like the novel, these short pieces rely heavily on quotation. Advertisements, store names, book titles in a shop window make up the layers of the urban text within the linear movements imposed by the tra- jectory of writing and the act of walking. Such continuities must not distract from the city's precarious position in Doblin's critical writings and the resultant tensions in his theorizing of urban subjec- tivity. On the one side, one finds unbridled optimism and great enthusiasm. In "Der Geist des naturalistischen Zeitalters" (1924), Diblin hails the big city as the ideal setting for the spiritual renewal of modemrn culture in the age of technology: "Der neue Geist macht die Stiidte zu seinem Leib und Instrument" (1989, 178). The linking of "Leib" and "Instrument" establishes a pro- ductive relationship between the city as an instrument of reason and rationality (i.e., the enlightenment tradition) and the city as a body for the future collective being (i.e., the new mythology). Doblin's view of cities as organs and conglomerations of organs finds expression, among others, in the ref- erence to "die neuerweckten Sinnesorgane, die keine Grenze finden" (1989, 182), and it stands behind his repeated attempts to introduce mythological elements into the modern wasteland. Just as Georg Simmel's city dweller depends increasingly on vision as the primary sense, the big city functions increasingly as a producer and consumer of sensory stimuli As a result of this destabi- lizing effect, urban culture changes the most basic categories of critical analysis, including the experience of space and the space of experience: Die GroBst~idte sind ein merkwiirdiger und kraftvoller Apparat. In ihren Stral3en ist fast korperlich zu f'ihlen der Wirbel von Antrieben und Spannungen, den die- se Menschen tragen, den sie ausstr6men und der sich ihrer bemaichtigt. (1989, 188f.) The comparison to physiological processes foregrounds the unique ability of cities to integrate differences and embrace perma- nent change. While censorship laws con- tinue tobe enforced in literature and the arts, Doblin argues, the big city triumphs as the censorship-free zone ofmodernculture. Win- dow displays become broadsides, poems, and manifestos, and the forms ofaestheticappre- ciation are redefined by the new mass media: Der unscheinbare Hiindler kann seine Waren dekorieren, beleuchten, suggestiv anordnen. Ein Blick zeigt, was hier getrie- ben wird: Bediirfnisse befriedigt und neue Bediirfnisse geziichtet. Intensiv praktisch wird hier am Menschen gearbeitet. Der technische Geist geht durch die Stm~Ben, agitiert und bildet. (1989, 189) Doblin's spirited comments on the city and modem culture remain at odds with his more subdued pronouncements on the future of the novel Concerned about the epic tradition, Doblin states rather bluntly that' "die StAidte haben alles zerstbrt" (1962, 18) by separating literature and its readers and by leaving writers without a responsi- bility or purpose. These dilemmas of the</page><page sequence="14">360 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Summer 1994 modern writer, which are also the dilem- mas of urbanism, explain his changing views on construction as a fundamentally modernist principle.8 The metaphor of construction plays a central role in his lit- erary criticism because it invites positive and negative inscriptions and accommo- dates traditional models of composition as well as the streamlined formulas of popular literature. Doblin resorts to architectural metaphors whenever he denounces certain literary trends. Here, construction refers to the growing mechanization in the literary profession and to its rampant mediocrity and lack ofinspiration. In a diatribe against contemporary novelists, Doblin uses spa- tial and architectural terms--floor plan, scaffolding, reinforced beams--to criticize their mechanistic approach to plot and character construction. The elaborate-but, ultimately, hol- low--building schemes of these so-called romanciers are juxtaposed with the kind of groundwork carried out, factually as well as symbolically, in the subway construction on Alexanderplatz. Construction first ap- pears in the 1913 Berlin Program and its motto: "Der Erzahlerschlendrian hat im Roman keinen Platz; man erzihlt nicht, sondern baut" (1989, 121f.). Under the in- fluence of Futurism, Doblin declares that "der Gegenstand des Romans ist die ent- seelte Realitait" (1989, 121), and he cites two truly modern and collective art forms, ar- chitecture and the cinema, to make his point. A neologism like Kinoismus, defined as the grasping of modern life in all its in- tensity and diversity, serves to legitimize his rejection of psychologism and his insis- tence on depersonalization, externalization (Entiuf3erung), and what is described else- where as an imagination built on facts. The enthusiastic appeals to architecture culmi- nate in the statement that "ich bin nicht ich, sondern die Stral3e, die Laternen, dies und dies Ereignis, weiter nichts. Das ist es, was ich den steinernen Stil nenne" (1989, 122). As the most public of all art forms, architecture inspires a theory of the epic that reconciles the perspectives of individ- ual and collective and reunites the needs of society with those of art. Here, construction remains the trademark of the true author. A comment like "Stil ist nichts als der Hammer, mit dem das Dargestellte aufs sachlichste herausgearbeitet wird" (1989, 127) claims constructive labor for tradi- tional notions of authorship. While this kind of imagery resonates with references to sculpture, the epic novel in Doblin's conception also privileges terms like "schichten, haiufen, wilzen, schieben" (1989,124) that come from civil rather than structural engineering and suggest a more radical commitment to formal innovation than any of the surface renovations per- formed by his contemporaries.9 The instability of the city as a literary topic and a model for modern writing di- rectly affects Doblin's theorizing of modern subjectivity and, as its most extreme mani- festation, the paranoid structure of urban experience. Caught between total rejection of bourgeois individualism and reaffirma- tion of the individual as part of the urban collective, he uses formal questions to work out these problems. Montage as the aes- theticization of fragmentation, and the city body as the prefiguration of some future mythological unity, mark the two poles in the simulation of the urban. The notion of montage, which has played a central role in the canonization of Berlin Alexander- platz as a city novel, belongs to the modern- ist layer in the textual construction and is closely aligned with those aspects ofsubjec- tivity that are identified as male: the control exerted by the author as master monteur, the stream of consciousness ofthe main pro- tagonist, including his violent fantasies of control; and, in a less obvious way, the figure of Death the Reaper who, through his own cutting, illuminates the montage principle from a deadly perspective. Given the influ- ence of Futurist and Dadaist ideas on his early work, it is rather surprising that Doblin never mentioned the term'montage' in conjunction with the novel Montage was</page><page sequence="15">HAKE: Doblin 361 introduced by Walter Benjamin, who, in an enthusiastic review that also evaluated the modern epic within the context of urban- ism, discerned similarities to Dada collages and silent film (Zimmermann 1979). He as- serted that "Stilprinzip dieses Buches ist die Montage. ... Die Montage sprengt den 'Roman,' sprengt ihn im Aufbau wie auch stilistisch, und eroiffnet neue, sehr epische Moglichkeiten" (3: 232). Berlin Alexander- platz, it might be added, takes advantage of these possibilities by introducing simul- taneity and parallelism, by tracing the cor- respondences between interior and exterior space, and by experimenting with new spa- tiotemporal relations. In all cases, experi- ence remains the ultimate reference point. No matter whether the montage sequences prefer a serialization or a confrontation; whether they stress their analytical or syn- thetic side: they are always testing the lim- its of experience and always aim at a new understanding of subjectivity.10 The mon- tage effect is one of fragmentation, disjunc- tion, displacement--an experience of sepa- ration intensified by the fact that it either occurs in the framework of stream of con- sciousness or from the perspective of an om- niscient narrator. Yet the function of mon- tage is to capture the complexity of urban life and, in so doing, to reproduce the inter- relatedness that enables the narrator to control these very disparate elements, and that prevents the main protagonist from resisting the attractions of the city. As a result, montage serves less as an instru- ment of political analysis or narrative con- tinuity than as a tool for exploring spa- tiotemporal relations and for examining phenomena like simultaneity and contigu- it3y; that explains its difference to Eisen- stein's montage of attractions and standard continuity editing in film.11 The concept of post-humanist subject utilizes the aesthetics of montage to pro- duce a new kind of unity, one of fragmenta- tion found in "dieses wuste Durcheinander von Organen." By externalizing the drama of character dissociation, montage makes possible the emergence of the post-human- ist subject in the midst of the urban collec- tive; it simulates the multiple layers of sensory perception. In revealing the mechanisms behind the urban diversity, it restores a sense of order to a world per- ceived as chaotic and devoid of meaning, the reconstruction of the fabric of cause and effect is its primary goal. Montage repro- duces the metaphysical unity that, at the beginning of the 20th century, could no longer be reached through traditional story- telling and bourgeois individualism. Thus, the oscillation between montage as disin- tegration and radical decentering and mon- tage as the confirmation of a subjectivity withoutboundaries gives rise, less to a criti- cal analysis of urbanism than to a simula- tion of the urban that emphasizes both the struggle for control and the submission to sensory stimuli. The following example illustrates some of these points. "Franz Biberkopf betritt Berlin" (1961, 49-59), one of the more inno- vative montage sequences, opens with the emblems for ten municipal offices, includ- ing underground construction and traffic, the notice of a scheme for the building lot situated An der Spandauer Briicke Nr. 10, a hunting license allowing Herr Bottich to shoot wild rabbits and other vermin, and a note honoring the furrier Pangel for years of public service. Once the narrator/pro- tagonist arrives at Rosenthaler Platz, these elements become shorter and more diversi- fied, thereby also increasing the sense of simultaneity, and adding to the overall ef- fect of multiperspectivism. The montage continues with the weather report for Ger- many, a list of all the stops on tramline Nr. 68, and the fares and regulations in Berlin's public transportation system, before other voices take over to imitate the cacophony of a busy intersection at midday. The descrip- tion of a near accident involving a pedes- trian and a car is followed by various ad- vertisements and a list of all the branches of the AEG company in the telephone book. Snippets of talk on the tram and a listing</page><page sequence="16">362 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Summer 1994 of streets converging on Rosenthaler Platz alternate with the names of stores and banks and the rendering of typical urban scenes. The desire to explore the complexity of this setting beyond the limitations ofsen- sory experience occasions a remarkable shift from the spatial to the temporal when the motives of four passengers are exam- ined and the life of one, the fourteen-year- old Max Riist, is summarized in a few sig- nificant events, including his early death at the age of 55. From the omnipresence associated with the moving in and out of particular urban situations to the kind of omnipotence-for what else is foreshadow- ing?-that defies the laws of time, this ex- ample shows to what degree montage in Berlin Alexanderplatz is above all a dem- onstration of narrative authority and con- trol. The urban chaos only highlights the power of the individual and places both, the narrator and the protagonist, in a position where experience is still possible-though at immense cost. While simultaneity organ- izes the representation of space (including the auditory space) within the temporal framework of the here and now, contiguity and continuity create the progressive, lin- ear movements associated with walking. Contiguity prevails whenever physical spaces are described, as in the transition from one store or tram stop to the next. By contrast, continuity brings out the tempo- ral qualities associated with history and bi- ography. Based on these three principles, montage leaves behind the logic of simula- tion and reconstruction, seeking precisely in the totality ofthe fragment a hidden prin- ciple of order-and new meaning. At first glance, the montage sequences seem at odds with the metaphorical eleva- tion of the city to a living organism, with the streets representing the vessels, and Alexanderplatz the heart.12 While mon- tage recalls the visual and literary experi- ments of Dada, the conception of the city as body continues an important topos of ex- pressionist poetry and prompts, among oth- ers, the transformation of street and pedes- trians into a gorge and stream.13 Montage implies fragmentation, though with the ul- timate goal of achieving closure, whereas the biologistic analogies, despite the ho- listic aura, announce the inevitable break- down of the closed system. Like organs con- tributing to the body's metabolism, the various aspects of the city-houses, streets, sounds, crowds, traffic--submit to the for- mative power of the whole in order to find redemption in what initially appears like fragmentation. Like the human body, the thus constituted city receives its identity from a totalizing perspective that organizes the relationships between individual parts and determines their place within a totality conceived outside of history. Comparisons to the coral reef, a formation based on natu- ral rather than socially-determined struc- tures, brings Doblin to describe the city as "der Korallenstock ftir das Kollektivwesen Mensch" (1989, 180). Frequent references to the city as a body might even recall physiocratic models that regard society as a corpus/corporation where various social groups fulfill their roles based on a natural selection process. In an essay that reveals a very similar approach to spatial and social distinctions, Berlin neighborhoods are equated with specific functions: "Da ballen sich, wie Lungen in der Brust, das Gehirn im Schadel, die Zahne in den Kiefern, Spe- zialitAten in den einzelnen Quartieren" (1962, 229). By facilitating an extended re- flection on wholeness and its loss, the body metaphor achieves a processualview of the city. Against the static order of houses and streets, physiological processes like incor- poration, assimilation, and transformation introduce traffic as a new model for urban relationships. Its systems of distribution and circulation structure the narrative from the description of Berlin's busy traffic squares to the paranoid episodes suffered by Franz Biberkopf. Given their modernist alliances, the body metaphors must be seen as part of an oscillation between modernity and myth that literally reproduces the city image and its subject on a different level</page><page sequence="17">HAKE: Dablin 363 Relegating them to the realm of mythology, and dismissing them as regressive or reac- tionary, would mean to ignore the dynamic at the heart of urban culture. For the dis- course of the city as body articulates the same problematic as the discourse of the city as montage. Where the former high- lights the degree of disintegration from a position of wholeness, the latter upholds the dream of unity through its involvement in the project of construction. That is why the reconciliation of the modem and the mythological finds a most fitting expression in the constant flow of vehicles, consumers, and goods-the modern spectacle of com- modity circulation-as they enter the city's "weiter Korper" (1962, 225), a body that-- this time, in accordance with mythological tradition-is marked as female.14 Doblin's later writings on the philoso- phy of nature locate the origins of modemrn subjectivity in the experience of separation and otherness, beginning, as in his theory of the epic work, with the divisions inside the self.15 Through the emphasis on uni- versal correspondences, Doblin outlines a program that reconciles the organicist model with the aesthetics of the fragment and provides the necessary link between the montage sequences and the body meta- phors. With the argument that "nur das Ganze hat Gestalt" (1962, 227), quantity is translated into quality and the separate parts are integrated into the whole. The gestalt guarantees the existence of the col- lective as a unified body and upholds the promise of truth, for"das Wahre kommt nur massenhaft vor"(1927, 239). While the Ber- lin Program emphatically rejects the cult of the individual, works like Das Ich iiber der Natur (1927) and UnserDasein (1933) char- acterize the relationship between individ- ual and collective as an ongoing process of self-engendering. Both treatises under- score the identity of world and experience and, in so doing, establish a critical frame- work for Berlin Alexanderplatz that makes the experience of the city the defining in- fluence in the formation of the post-human- ist subject.16 The process of "animation" (Beseelung) links the organic and the inor- ganic and creates a world that is preserved in the self, while at the same time allowing the self to identify with the world. Its be- ginnings are located in the individual, and its various stages are worth quoting at length: Die Entzweiung in der Welt, sichtbar ge- worden in der zwiefachen Gestalt der Per- son als Stuick und Gegenstiick der Welt. Die Person zeigt deutlich diese Doppelna- tur als Gebilde, das ganz aus der Natur hervorwaichst, aus Tier- und Pflanzen- welt, und mit ihnen verbunden bleibt, und als Erlebnis-, Arbeits-, Einschmelzungs-, Umbildungsapparat. Es findet eine Hin- und Herbewegung zwischen Person und Welt statt, so kann sie stattfinden. In die- ser Hin- und Herbewegung wird die Welt gebaut. Diese Bautfitigkeit kommt nicht zum Stillstand, solange die Person lebt. Ein Spannungsablauf erfolgt dauernd, und so geht Erlebtes, also Ich, iiber das Medium und aus der Apparatur der Per- son in Welt, Natur, Geschichte iiber, und es schwingt Welt, Natur, Geschichte in die Person und das Ich zurfick. (1964, 30) The division between the body, which is part of the (animated) object world, and the dis- embodied I, which depends on the immedi- acy of the experienced, is overcome through a process ofmediation thatconfirmsthebody as organism and makes it part of the larger social organism; this is precisely the experi- ence Biberkopf makes after the three fatal blows against him. Urban paranoia in Berlin Alexander- platz provides a testing ground for some of these ideas. More important still, the pro- cess of subject formation and the theory of epic writing come together through another discursive element: the rhizome, Deleuze and Guattari's favorite metaphor of non- linear, nonhierarchical discourse without authorial center. While the paranoid con- sciousness provides a model through which the experience of the city can be theorized in terms of projections, hallucinations, in-</page><page sequence="18">364 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Summer 1994 corporations, lines of convergence and dis- integration, the rhizome introduces the possibility of a discourse of the city outside of the traditional oppositions of individual and collective, perception and object world, representation and the real. Like the para- noid who evades the oedipal triangle, the rhizome lacks the linear structure associ- ated with the arborescent system and the radicle system. Through the rhizome, the artificial division between the modernist city montage and the metaphorics of the city body is overcome in discursive move- ments that, by defying binary logic, provide a map for the urban text of Berlin Alexan- derplatz: "In a book, as in all things, there are lines of articulation or segmentarity, strata and territories; but also lines of flight, movements of deterritorialization and destratification" (1987, 3). Yet writing the urban should not be confused with the project of representation. The rhizome, unlike the tree or the radicle, connects all points to each other and produces a multi- plicity that is not only heterogeneous but also lacks the oppositions which still rule other decentered structures. For the rhizome is anti-genealogical and nonhier- archical. In the place of structure, it is con- stituted by lines of intersection, of conver- gence, of rupture, and of flight.17 Rejecting the laws of signification, the rhizome text resembles "a map that is always detach- able, connectable, reversible, modifiable, and has multiple entryways and exits and its own lines of flight" (Deleuze and Guat- tari 1987, 21). Writing, the authors con- clude, has to do with surveying and map- ping, not with signification. A return to the Alexanderplatz pas- sages may help summarize these points.18 Traditionally, they have been analyzed through terms like cross section, serializa- tion, simultaneity, stream of consciousness, self-reflexivity, and, most, importantly, montage. Its various elements have been identified and categorized, and the rela- tionships between urban material and nar- rative voice been described, in terms of the narrator's changing relation to the protago- nist and the scene of action and through the variations in the tone and mode of articu- lation. However, the totality of these effects has continuously resisted critical evalu- ation. Often described in vague terms like chaos or diversity, the underlyingprinciples of encircling, traversing, and invading re- sist assessments that focus on authorial in- tentions, formal strategies, and narrative effects. The figure of the rhizome shows that the ruptures and incommensurabilities must not necessarily be regarded as signs of breakdown or failure. They are, in fact, the traces of an underlying structure of mapping, they are the products of an all- encompassing system of production. Thus, the notion ofparanoia actually uncovers the efficient economy of means behind the "struggle" between city and main protago- nist. That very different order is es- tablished through the coupling and uncou- pling of the desiring-machines and has as its main purpose the continuation of this process. Berlin Alexanderplatz, therefore, is above all about the urban experience as an encounter with intermediary states. Here, Benjamin's characterization of the place is very insightful: Was ist der Alexanderplatz in Berlin? Das ist die Stelle, wo seit zwei Jahren die ge- waltsamsten Verainderungen vorgehen, Bagger und Rammen ununterbrochen in Tihtigkeit sind, der Boden von ihren St&amp;- 13en, von den Kolonnen der Autobusse und U-Bahnen zittert, tiefer als sonstwo die Eingeweide der GroBstadt ... sich aufge- tan, und stiller als anderswo ... sich Ge- genden aus den neunziger Jahren gehalten haben. (1980, 3: 233f.) Translated into the terms of the rhizome, such a scenario represents the convergence and dissemination of the various forces that enter into the urban experience: not in the form of a forward and backward, or as accel- eration and rtardation, but in the context of simultaneity, multiplicity, heterogeneity; not through the alternatives of destruction</page><page sequence="19">HAKE: Doiblin 365 or preservation, but with the possibility of their accidental coexistence; not merely un- der the rule of terror, but also with curiosity and exhilaration. Hence, it is quite appropri- ate to isolate one particular aspect of the rhi- zome-its being in the middle, between things--to describe the urban experience in Berlin Alexanderplatz. As Deleuze and Guattari note: "Between things does not designate a localizable relation going from one thing to the other and back again, but a perpendicular direction, a transversalmove- ment that sweeps one and the other away" (1987, 25). Whether under the label of post-humanist or paranoid consciousness, Doblin's novel simulates precisely such an intermediary state, and that continues to be its most important contribution to the theo- rizing of the urban in the early 20th century. Notes 1Compare the introduction to Mario von Bucovich's photobook on Berlin, where Doblin declares that "Berlin ist gr6fltenteils unsicht- bar... Nur das Ganze hat ein Gesicht und einen Sinn: den einer starken nidchternen modernen Stadt, einer produzierenden Massensiedlung" (1928, viii and x). 2"Post-humanist" subject refers to a subject no longer constituted through the individual- society opposition and the kind of social con- tract and rationality outlined by the enlighten- ment tradition. In psychoanalytical terms, the post-humanist subject suggests the dissolution of the traditional oedipal structure and its re- placement by a decentered subjectivity consti- tuted through narcissism (rather than repres- sion) and the primacy of the visual (rather than of language). On the implications for architec- ture, and the work of Meyer and Hilberseimer in particular, see Hays. 3For a comprehensive documentation of the contemporary reception of Berlin Alexander- platz, including the polemical debates in the Linkskurve, see Prangel 53-111. 4The secondary literature on Berlin Alexan- derplatz as a city novel is extensive and in- cludes important contributions by Albrecht Schone, Volker Klotz, and Harald J?hner. Some critics see the narrative style as a convincing representation of urban chaos (Martini 358f.; Ziolkowski 110f.), while others interpret the novel's disparate elements as a diversity re- united by and in language (Schine 316). Some emphasize Doblin's double role of detached monteur and omniscient narrator in the crea- tion of the city text (Klotz 379), while for others the city almost tells itself, without the pres- ence of a mediating figure (Schine 323). For some, the city functions as a metaphor of life itself (Keller 145), while others perceive the city as a stage for contemporary events, thatis, Zeit- geschichte (Titche 135). Questioning the narra- tability of the city, Scherpe has recently argued that "Doblin substitutes a structural and dis- cursive method of narrating the city for the old- er mythic narrative representations" (165) that still depend on the dramatization of opposites. Accordingly, for Scherpe, it is through the fail- ure of narration that the novel draws attention to the abstraction in modern society, and thus confirms its modernist agenda. 5Keller relates the falling roofs to Biber- kopfs fear of death (146, 203). Klotz links the motif to Biberkopfs lack of orientation and inner balance, thus also emphasizing the ex- changes between inside and outside (400). Freisfeld juxtaposes the vertical movement represented by the sliding roofs to the recon- struction of the city through walking and other horizontal movements (166f.). 6The relationship between Biberkopf and Berlin has been discussed at great length in the critical literature. Some scholars emphasize the conflict between city and protagonist, as ar- ticulated in the threat of depersonalization (Koopmann 100), or interpret the individual- collective complex as an unresolved problem in Doblin's entire work (Scherer), while others see both categories as parts of a metaphysical whole (Fries 43-45). Focusing on questions of narrative, some critics have tried to avoid these oppositions and (following Doblin's own com- ments) have likened Biberkopf to a probe in- serted in the city's spaces (Klotz 410) or a cen- tral figure reflecting the diverse collage material (Miiller-Salget 298). Others have used other distinctions to underscore the actual fact of transgression: for instance, through the jux- taposition ofBildungsroman and Gropstadtro- man (Ledanff94-98) or the differentiation be-</page><page sequence="20">366 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Summer 1994 tween "Leiden an der Stadt" (with Rilke's Malte as the prototype) and the Doblinian"Leiden der Stadt" (Freisfeld 6). 7In my reading of this passage, I have prof- ited from the excellent analysis by Jiihner (66- 81). 8For instance, the work on a tunnel linking Bahnhof Zoo and Wittenbergplatz stations gives rise to an extended reflection on techno- logical advances in structural engineering, technology as a new literary topic, and prob- lems of narrative construction (qtd. in Meyer 116f.). 9Compare the 1929 essay "Der Bau des epi- schen Werks" that outlines the literary pro- gram of Berlin Alexanderplatz and, in the con- text of my discussion of urban subjectivity, might be of further interest because of its gen- dered conception of the writing process and of modernist literature in general. Hence the statement: "Der wirklich Produktive aber mull zwei Schritte tun: er mufl ganz nahe an die Rea- litiit heran, an ihre Sachlichkeit, ihr Blut, ihren Geruch, and dann hat er die Sache zu durch- stoflen, das ist seine spezifische Arbeit" (1989, 219). 10Schwimmer distinguishes between ana- lytic montage as the presentation of a unified event from multiple perspectives and synthetic montage as the bringing together of disparate elements (89-92). 11Ekkehard Kaemmerling compares Berlin Alexanderplatz to a written film and equates narrative strategies with filmic techniques like shot size, point of view, shot/counter shot, slow motion, and time lapse as well as with various forms of montage such as contrast and paral- lelism (185-98). By contrast, Martini finds the influence of cinema most pronounced in the steady flow of images and the effervescence of the street scenes (360). Both take Doblin's earli- er comments on Kinostil and the ubiquity of cinema in Weimar Berlin as sufficient proof for an actual relationship of influence between novel and cinema. Their analyses rely to a large degree on film techniques from the classical narrative cinema-inflected by the art film movements of their times (e.g., neorealism in the case of Martini)--that were not yet fully developed in the silent German fim, while at the same time ignoring the considerable differ- ences between the montage theories of Griffith and Eisenstein. While the latter uses the colli- sion of two shots to produce specific cognitive effects, the former-and with him, the entire tradition of continuity editing-seeks to create continuity, to gloss over the breaks, to deny the presence of an author. Certain narrative posi- tions resemble filmic techniques such as point of view, close-up, or traveling shot, but their function in the novel is precisely to break the illusion and make self-reflexive comments on the state of narrative in modernity. The equa- tion of filmic and literary montage and the characterization of Dbblin's narrative style as filmic has been criticized by Bayerdorfer (162f.) and Jiihner (141). 12The anthropomorphic element is even more pronounced in the description of the Ro- senthaler Platz under the heading "Der Rosen- thaler Platz unterhbilt sich." 13Compare an earlier description of the Friedrichstrafle in Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine: "Vom Murren dieser Menschen ist das Tal dieser Stra8e erfUillt, von ihrem won- nigen Streifen Arm an Arm, Schulter an Schul- ter. Sie sehen rechts und links in die beschla- genen Scheiben, liicheln, eilen. Die Hiiuserfron- ten auseinandergerissen, durch Glasplatten durchsichtig gemacht; zwischen den Pfeilern laden die Hiiuser ihren Inhalt auf. Auf den wenigen Mauerresten zucken grelle Ankiindi- gungen" (1982, 315). 14Since woman cannot be exorcised from the spaces of modernity, she returns, quite lit- erally, as its underside: as the Whore of Baby- lon, in the main protagonist's desire to conquer the (female) body of the city, and through his desire to lose himself in orgasmic or paranoid spasms. The motif of the Whore of Babylon (Revelation 17: 1-6) is introduced as follows: "Und nun komm her, du, komm, ich will dir etwas zeigen. Die grof3e Hure, die Hure Baby- lon, die da am Wasser sitzt. Und du siehst ein Weib sitzen auf einem scharlachfarbenen Tier. Das Weib ist voll Namen der Liisterung und hat 7 Hiiupter und 10 Horner. Es ist bekleidet mit Purpur und Scharlach und iibergildet mit Gold und edlen Steinen und Perlen und hat einen goldenen Becher in der Hand. Und an ihrer Stirn ist geschrieben ein Name, ein Geheimnis: die grolle Babylon, die Mutter aller Greuel auf Erden. Das Weib hat vom Blut aller Heiligen getrunken. Das Weib ist trunken vom Blut der Heiligen"(BA260). Keller links the figure to the theme of conquest and the struggle of primeval</page><page sequence="21">HAKE: Doblin 367 evil forces (170-72), whereas Muschg sees her as an embodiment of Biberkopfs moral decline (Doblin 1961, 520). Considerations of space pre- vent a further discussion of this complex, but I would tentatively argue that the motif is part of the gendered division between modernist and mythological elements. 15Some of these ideas are spelled out in the 1931 article "Die Gesellschaft, das Ich, das Kol- lektivum" (1970, 295-97). The influence of D&amp;- blin's philosophy ofnature onBerlinAlexander- platz and the changes in his views on individual and society have been examined by Schone through the notion of resonance (308, 316) and by Koopmann in a more author-oriented analy- sis (85). 16Note, for instance, the description of a bus ride through Berlin in Das Ich iiber der Natur (Doblin 1927, 82f.) which reads like a pre-study for Berlin Alexanderplatz. 17Here, one might even want to rethink the usefulness of the term 'montage' in relationship to Berlin Alexanderplatz. Deleuze and Guat- tari's definition of assemblage (1987, 4) or L6vi- Strauss's notion of bricolage in The Savage Mind are in many ways better suited to accom- modate the novel's narrative and libidinal tra- jectory and account for its radical openness to multiplicity and heterogeneity. 18For similar examples of urban montage, see the description of the tenement building on Linienstral3e (1961, 132f.) or the Labor Court in ZimmerstraBe (1961, 337f.).
