Gudovitch (this volume).1 Both were found, along with eight beads, near the uppermost skull in Burial Trough A, and seem to belong to the same necklace. As will be shown, both objects belong to small, clearly defined groups of the Middle Bronze Age. Scarab IAA 92-1128; Reg. No. 53/6; Trough A (Fig. 1). Material. Faience, brownish and whitish glaze. Dimensions: L 21 mm, W 14.75 mm, H 7.5 mm. Method of Manufacture'. Molding, glazing. Workmanship: Good. Technical Details: Perforated, not by drilling. Preservation: Almost complete. There is a scar at either end of the perforation, most probably caused by the metal ring to which the scarab was affixed. Base Design In a vertical disposition, one compact scene is depicted: a seated anthropomorphic figure fac ing a branch; below, a small basket-like element. The anthropomorphic figure, a male with long hair, most probably represents a Canaanite dig nitary clad in a long garment with shoulder Fig. 1. The Moza 'Illit scarab.</page><page sequence="2">Baruch Brandl straps.' The right hand rests upon the hip, and the left arm is raised. The left heel is shown behind an emphatically broad right shank. The chair, probably a throne,1 is depicted in profile. It has a low back and lion's legs, front and rear. The branch, its leaves to one side of the stalk, is topped with a blossom. Judging by depictions on other scarabs, it may be identified as a com posite palm-branch and lotus-blossom.4 The basket-like element, reminiscent of the hieroglyph nb, serves here, as elsewhere, both as space-filler in the lower part of the scarab oval and a base for the main scene. This scarab lacks the typical oval frame. The deficiency is compensated for by the curved out line of the design elements: in clockwise or der—the lotus branch, the «(?-shaped element, the back of the throne and the figure's coiffure. Typology and Style The Moza Tllit find belongs to a small and very distinctive group of scarabs, more common in Canaan than in Egypt. The group includes exca vated scarabs from Gezer and Tel Michal, as well as scarabs from collections (see Fig. 2). These scarabs were not covered by Tufnell's classification.5 Keel's elaboration of Tufnell's Fig. 2. Scarab parallels. 1.

Like our scarab, the Gezer scarab seems to have a dark glaze (Petrie identified the material as schist), and decorated back. 2.

All share a common feature—the broad shank of the central figure. It is a feature found on several other scarabs from Canaan, such as those from Gezer (Macalister 1904:224, PI. 6:1 = 1912 11:315 No. 77, III:P1. 204b: 1) and Tell el'Ajjul (Petrie 1933:4, PI. 3:35 = Tufnell 1984:N0. 2516/2651/2754 = Schroer 1985:84 Fig. 50, 86 - Giveon 1985:84-85, No. 71), and it seems to indicate a single workshop or pro duction center.8 Iconography The figure on the Gezer scarab, originally iden tified as female (Petrie in Macalister 1902:365; Macalister 1912 11:315 No. 55), was recognized by Galling (1937:24) to represent a male. Pieper (1930:196) identified the sitting figure on the Berlin scarab as a Semitic deity. This suggestion was adopted by Galling (1937:24; 1977:10). Despite my identification of the figure as a Canaanite dignitary, the cultic interpretation should not be ruled out: Two gold plaques found at Ras Shamra-Ugarit (Schaeffer 1938:319, Figs. 149:1 and 4; 1939:138, Figs. 114 and 120),9 dated to the fourteenth-thirteenth centuries BCE,10 resemble our group of scarabs. They de pict female figures clad in long robes, seated on high-backed thrones," and holding plants. These figures have been identified as goddesses (Bossert 1951: N0.776; Dever 1984:23). Date The scarab should be dated to the Fifteenth ("Hyksos") Dynasty or MB IIC12 on the follow ing considerations: (a) All the scarabs attributed on the basis of motif to Keel's Design Class 10D are of local "Hyksos" style.13 (b) All the scarabs containing the stylistic fea ture of broad-shanked human figures belong to the "Hyksos" group. Unfortunately, the six scarabs belonging to the subgroup discussed here, including the exca vated ones, lack good stratigraphie al context. Cylinder Seal IAA 92-1127; Reg. No. 53/4; Trough A (Figs. 3-5). Material. Haematite. Dimensions'. H 19 mm, D 11.5 mm, circumfer ence 36.5 mm. Method of Manufacture: Carving, drilling, pol ishing. Workmanship: Excellent. Technical Details: Perforated off-axis, drilled from both sides; the perforation is enlarged at both ends. Preservation: Slightly chipped in three places, one on the upper and two on the lower edge. Description4 The seal is composed of a main scene and a terminal (or secondary scene); it lacks upper and lower line borders. The main scene is composed of standing hu man figures, a female on the left and two males on the right. The female figure, dressed in a fringed mantle15 and holding a double-barbed spear, faces a male figure dressed in a kilt and fringed mantle and holding a curved staff in its right hand. An enigmatic symbol termed "ball and-staff'16 or "libra,1"17 held in its left hand, rests on its right foot. In the field, beneath the staff, is a fish.18 The second male figure, dressed in a short fringed dress with a double belt, grasps a double barbed spear similar to that held by the female figure. Both male figures are beardless and their hair is short. In the absence of attrib utes, it cannot be said whether the anthropomor phic figures represent gods or mortals. The terminal consists of five common ele ments frequently occuring on Syrian seals, ar ranged in three horizontal registers. The upper register contains a couchant hare facing left, with one detached antelope head behind it and traces of another in front of it. The central regis ter contains a guilloche enclosed in two parallel</page><page sequence="4">10 Baruch Brandl Fig. 3. The Moza Tllit cylinder seal. lines. The lower register shows an eagle facing left. Both hare and eagle wear a double collar.19 Style and Typology The style of the seal features the long arms and characteristic pointing gesture of the human fig ures (Fig. 4). There is a pronounced linearity in the details: the prominent triangular noses and eyes, and the parallel lines used to depict the hair, clothes, weapons and bird's wings. These stylistic features permit us to attribute the seal to the "Workshop A" group—a North Syrian linear style belonging to the "classical" stage of the Middle Bronze Age. The group, ascribed to workshops in Ugarit, has been dated to 1820-1740 BCE. The first step in the definition of this group was made by Schaeffer (Schaeffer 1974; Schaeffer-Forrer 1983:10, 30-34) who grouped several seals from Ugarit (Schaeffer 1932:3, PI. 11:1a; 1949:40-41 Fig. 14, 57 Fig. 21)20 with Cylinder Seal A 357 from Chagar Bazar (Mai lowan 1937:97, 111, 136-137, Fig. 14:3, PI. 12:1; 1967:208). Collon defined the group as a workshop, adding two excavated seals (from Tell el-'Ajjul and Kiiltepe) as well as sixteen seals from collections (Collon 1985; 1987:52 Nos. 206-207, 210-211; Porada 1985: 96-97, Fig. 20) to the five published by Schaeffer. Col Ion (1985:58) also identified Ugarit as the pro Fig. 4. Detail of figures.</page><page sequence="5">Scarab and Cylinder Seal from Moza 11 SSe$ "sr_. Fig. 5. Continuous-exposure image of the cylinder seal (see n. 1). duction center and adduced additional dating evidence from the Kiiltepe Level lb seal. Recently, Teissier (1996:14—17) coined the term "Workshop A," adding several seals to the group, including an additional example from Ugarit (Schaeffer 1932:3, PI. 11:1c, 3; Bossert 1951: No. 831b; Schaeffer-Forrer 1983:14—15; Amiet 1992:26, 29, No. 32; Teissier 1996: No. 182). With the discovery of the cylinder seal from Moza Tllit—the second item of "Workshop A" to be found in the country—it may be possible to attribute a small group of seals within this work shop to a single craftsman. These include the seal from Moza, and Seals R.S. 9.300 and R.S. 9.888 from Ugarit, characterized by the distinc tive elongated hands (Fig. 6). Date The cylinder seal from Moza Tllit should be dated, on the basis of the stratified parallels from Ugarit, Chagar Bazar, and Kiiltepe, to the mid eighteenth century BCE.2' Summary and Conclusions Both the scarab and the cylinder seal belong to very small and distinctive groups of the Middle Bronze Age. Each of these groups could be re lated to a workshop 01־ production center within the Syro-Palestinian or Canaanite sphere and each reveals affinities with the Canaanite center of Ras Shamra-Ugarit. It seems likely that both objects were found by the person they were buried with, perhaps in a nearby burial cave or caves.22 The phenomenon of Byzantine burials containing Middle Bronze Age seals has been encountered at a number of sites.־ As the two seals from Moza Tllit appear to differ in their production dates, it may be suggested that they were found in two different caves or in one cave with a long range of use. Alternatively, the cylinder seal may have been in use in Middle Bronze Age Canaan at a later date than that attributed to the activity of "Work shop A" in North Syria. Fig. 6.

Thanks are due to Dominique Collon of the Department of Western Asiatic Antiquities at the British Mu seum, and Beatrice Teissier of Wolfson College, Oxford, who viewed the cylinder seal in Jerusa lem and kindly offered their comments, to Rafi Greenberg of the IAA, who commented on the original manuscript, and to Brace Zuckerman, School of Religion, University of Southern Cali fornia, for producing the photograph of the cyl inder seal during his visit to Jerusalem in 1994. Notes 1 The objects were drawn by Josephine Jaroshevich and photographed by Clara Amit. Fig. 5 was pre pared by B. Zuckerman, using a continuous-expo sure technique adapted for use with a 35 mm camera. In this technique, the surface of the seal is recorded by means of synchronized rotation and film expo sure. 2 The scarab is worn but compare with the scarabs from Gezer, Tel Michal and the Pelizaeus Museum, Hildesheim described below. 3 Murray was the first to identify this chair as a throne (Murray 1949:93). 4 For the two plants separately, see Petrie 1930:P1. 7:50 (= Murray 1949:93, PI. 9:2); combined, see Petrie 1934:P1. 11:399 (= Murray 1949:P1. 10:13). 5 On the history and development of Tufnell's de sign classification see Brandi 1986:247 n. 4. 6 It is erroneously termed 10E in the discussion (Keel 1995a: 162, 229). 7 One scarab from Pella, Tomb 62 (Millard 1991:134-135, PI. 151 left = Smith and Potts 1992: 79-80, PI. 39:b.4 = Richards 1992:20, 90-91, PI. 3 = Keel 1995a:219? -220, Fig. 474) is a variant of this group, with decorated back. 8 Keel (1995b) has recently discussed the issue of workshops in Palestine. 9 According to later publications they are of elec trum (Winter 1983:Figs. 481^182; Dever 1984:23). 10 According to Negbi the date of that hoard ranges between the mid-fifteenth and late fourteenth centu ries BCE (Negbi 1976:101). J1Cf. Negbi 1970:30, PI. 4:20-21; Metzger 1985: Nos. 1155-1156. 12The writer follows Tufnell's view that the "Hyk sos" period equals the Fifteenth Dynasty and that it lasted about a century, c. 1650-1550 BCE (Tufnell 1978:87; 1984:196-201, Table 34). 13 Petrie was the first to suggest that the 'Hyksos' scarabs were of Canaanite workmanship (Petrie 1931:3; Murray 1949:92). 14 The directions refer to the modern impression. 15 Cf. Schroer 1985:56-57, Fig. 3. 16 For the "ball-and-staff' see Collon 1986:49-51. 17 E.g., Ôztan 1993:504. 18 Cf. the fish on a seal from Cyprus (Schaeffer-For rer 1983:66-A18; Schroer 1985:58-59. Fig. 7; Teis sier 1996:N0. 138). 19 For all terminal components cf. Schroer 1985:58 59, Figs. 6-7 and 82-83, Fig. 44; Teissier 1996:N0s. 208, 138 and 118, respectively. 20 Two additional seals from the Ashmolean (Bucha nan 1966:No. 887) and Seyrig collections (Cf. Doumet 1992:N0. 284) bought in Beirut and said to come from Ugarit, were also included by him in the group. 21 However, other dates have been attributed to "Workshop A" cylinder seals: Williams-Forte, who published the ex-Borowski Collection cylinder seal (Williams-Forte 1981:N0. 213; Collon 1985:N0. 6; Teissier 1996:No. 178), dates it to c. 1800-1700 BCE. Bleibtrau ascribes a 19th-16th century range to a seal in Vienna which she compares to Chagar Bazar Seal A 357 (Bleibtrau 1981 :No. 82; Teissier 1996:206). 22 Several Middle Bronze Age burial caves are known from Moza clllit, including three which have been excavated (Sussman 1966). Recent excavations have revealed traces of the Middle Bronze Age set dement (De Groot and Greenhut 1995:73). 23 For example, "Hyksos" scarabs were found at Ha Goshrim (Foerster 1965) and south-west of Tirat Zevi (Foerster 1977), while a Haematite cylinder seal of Syrian style was found at Tel-Hai (Barag 1977:7; Mazar 1978:8).</page><page sequence="7">Scarab and Cylinder Seal from Moza 13 References Amiet P. 1992.
