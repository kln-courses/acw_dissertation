            <p>I’ll tell you how this functions: I am going to use a metaphor from astrophysics… I was wondering how they found out that there was a black hole, because a black hole by definition is something that you cannot see, but apparently they know about it because of the movement of the stars around it … the way that the stars move and the way that the light is tilted and the gravity … and all of this stuff is an indication of a really strong singularity within that galaxy. So what I … will try and do is exactly this. I am not going to talk about the war, but I am going to present … a constellation with these stars: everything that I show you is one of those stars.<sup>1</sup>

         <p>Tony Chakar teaches art history as well as the history of architecture in the Acadèmie Libanaise des Beaux Arts (ALBA) in Beirut. He is an architect, writer and artist: the order of those attributes may change depending on when and where his biography is published, and he often identifies as the first or the first two, but never as an artist alone. It may not be a stretch to identify Chakar simply as a storyteller, given that a large part of his practice is in the form of text, be it written (short stories, essays, architectural and urban-planning case studies) or spoken (lecture-performances and guided tours), and that even in the rare instances where his work is installed in exhibition spaces, it is unabashedly text-heavy.</p>
         <p>A good storyteller, it is said, spends time describing the details of things, while allowing the listener to interpret and make his or her own connections between the various elements conveyed.<sup>2</sup> One of the places where the art of storytelling flourished was on the docks of ships, where travellers and explorers would retell their encounters and mythologise their findings, while looking over the perpetually unfolding sea. For Chakar, a Netscape Navigator of sorts, the skyline of the ancestral storyteller often merges with another, virtual horizon. As early as 2003, in an essay titled ‘Once Upon a Time There Was a Mouth’, he described facing the screen of his outdated computer and trying to imagine himself on the beach staring out onto the horizon, listening to the waves, in a bid to drown out the humming drone of his faulty hardware: ‘Paul Virilio writes about isolation. He writes about computers and their screens, saying that these screens are our new horizon.’<sup>3</sup> While internet imagery has not always been a point of focus for Chakar, his latest works come out of precisely this isolated and solitary Virilian space, out of the depths of the asocial spaces of YouTube and Facebook through which he has experienced the mass uprisings in Egypt and neighbouring Syria.</p>
         <p>Chakar’s writings, in particular his short stories, often weave together personal stories, fantasy tales and literary references, which remain devoid of theatrical patina no matter how strange, morbid or terrifying the material. Walter Benjamin might have called this a ‘chaste compactness which forgoes psychological shading’.<sup>4</sup> Writing in the mid-1930s, the German thinker argued that the craft of storytelling had subsided in part due to the decline of the ‘omnipresence and vividness’ of death in the collective conscience, describing a progressive shift from dying as a public process in medieval times to a contemporary suppression of the visibility of death: ‘There used to be no house, hardly a room, in which someone had not once died’, before death became relegated to ‘sanatoria and hospitals’.<sup>5</sup> It is in this triangulation of language, architecture and death that Chakar’s stories often begin. If it is the dwindling of the visibility of death in society that brings on the decline of storytelling, then Chakar is here to assure us that, at least in the case of Beirut, even buildings in the process of being constructed have already been touched by death: ‘In reality,’ he tells us, ‘death is all around.’<sup>6</sup> In ‘Once Upon a Time There Was a Mouth’, he writes about the anguish he felt upon his rotten tooth falling out: holding it, he describes ‘carrying [his] … decaying body in [his] hands’.<sup>7</sup> According to Benjamin, ‘even the poorest wretch in dying possesses [authority] for the living around him’.<sup>8</sup> Chakar can tell one hundred thousand tales<sup>9</sup> with the authority of not just his own demise, but the 200,000 deaths of the Lebanese Civil Wars (1975—90) that have forever altered the very possibility of a cohesive social fabric in the country.<sup>10</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Chakar ‘search[es] frantically … for every little detail, for every insignificant story that took place’.<sup>11</sup> He sees reminders of impending doom in fashion trends like faded denim jeans,<sup>12</sup> and reads the advent of the apocalypse in the infamous inability of Beirutis to stick to one language, generally preferring to speak a mix of French, English and Arabic, and none of them close to well.<sup>13</sup> This is Babel again: God punishing the nation, confusing its tongues and scattering its people across the world.</p>
         <p>How to tell stories, then, after the breakdown of language? In one of his lectures, Chakar quotes Ludwig Wittgenstein to speak of this incapacity to convey the experience of catastrophe: ‘One should remain quiet about that which one cannot speak,’ only to continue, ‘if I remained silent, then I would not be here.’<sup>14</sup>

            <p>Things have a habit of coming back, especially in cities like Beirut. Moreover, things don’t just simply ‘come back’. When they do come, they bring with them an inexplicable sense of dread, which may be due to the fact that what has come back had been lost forever, that it is no longer ‘real’ or from our reality, and, as such, it throws all of this reality into doubt.<sup>15</sup>

         <p>How to create common memory, common history or civic fabric in a fratricidal and cannibalistic world? Never mind all that, how to say ‘good morning’ to your neighbour after a fifteen-year-long civil war such as the one that ravaged Lebanon from 1975 until 1990? Chakar investigates these points of contact where the mundane and the catastrophic collide. When in the form of lectures, these enquiries never solidify into a final outcome. Instead they are constantly updated, creating new links and passing over the old at every subsequent iteration. With these ever-evolving investigations Chakar attempts to give some sort of body, text or image to help his audience visualise how the catastrophic creates tears, rips and flashes in our space and time, and what these interruptions and displacements may reveal.<sup>16</sup>

         <p>Chakar sometimes employs clunky strategies to formally address his ambivalence vis-à-vis the image. In the lecture <italic>One Hundred Thousand Solitudes</italic> (first performed at the 11th Sharjah Biennial, and again at the 6th Home Works forum in Beirut, both in 2013), he examines imagery that emerged from the ongoing wave of Arab revolutions and worldwide Occupy movements.<sup>17</sup> Most often culled from social media sites, the images he analyses show people on the street holding signs, or protestors being beaten by police, or other iconic gestures of unrest widely circulated on the internet. In his eyes, they are singular flashes in which the entirety of history unfolds itself. In the depictions of ‘the dead coming back to life, rivers turning into blood, people speaking in one tongue, the last becoming first, the reversal of historical order, men turning into women and vice versa’,<sup>18</sup> he sees signs of the onset of messianic times. As part of the same project, Chakar published the book <italic>The Dialogue That Is Us</italic> (2013), in which he refers to Georges Seurat’s pointillist paintings to ask: ‘But what if the world is actually like this? The closer we examine the world, the more it crumbles; the further we gaze upon it to fathom its truth, the more it disappears.’<sup>19</sup> In each iteration of the project, Chakar employs a different approach to the image: for the book, he collaborated with Iraqi artist Ali Eyal to reproduce internet images as drawings; in the first lecture at the Sharjah Biennial, he simply presented text captions describing the images rather than the pictures themselves; and at Home Works, he flashed each image for a fraction of a second before replacing it with a written caption.</p>
         <p>One of the images is of an elderly woman perambulating the line separating the military from protesters along the circumference of Tahrir Square in Cairo, distributing mangos to the soldiers in order to appease them during the tense stand-offs in the lead-up to Hosni Mubarak’s downfall in early 2011. Chakar then tells the story of the Greek goddess Gaia, who mated with Eros to create the universe. Distance was created, it is said, when the abundant and chaotic fertilisation between Gaia and Eros had to be controlled, and it is through this separation that the horizon was created. Chakar makes a parallel between this separating line and the circular horizon retraced by the path of the woman distributing mangos. By separating and reuniting the soldiers on the one side and the demonstrators on the other, the woman’s image becomes a flash re-apparition of the goddess Gaia, and the mangos become the fruits of her fertility with Eros.<sup>20</sup>

         <p>In the brief instances they appear to us, Chakar’s slides literally allude to the flashes of historical memory that Benjamin argues are to be seized at the very moment of their appearance, during states of emergency. For Benjamin these memories provide the understanding of history needed not only to liberate the past but also the very methodologies of history writing (and the politics inherent within them) from irretrievable disappearance.<sup>21</sup> In Chakar’s work, this is tantamount to seizing the emancipatory potential of the image itself. Images, he notes, ‘[are] constantly relegated to the realm of the representational, with all that the idea of “representation” carries: the non-authentic, the false, the reflection, etc. It hasn’t always been such.’<sup>22</sup> In contrast to this scepticism of the visual, Chakar often refers to religious icons (mostly as a metaphor to speak about alternate potential roles for images), locating their sanctity in the fact that they do not represent but rather embody divinity, and function as what he calls ‘First Images’ of sanctity itself.<sup>23</sup> The philosopher Marie-José Mondzain would call these ‘incarnational images’. In discussing the importance of the image in Christianity, she describes a similar seizure of the visible: the incarnation of Christ, she says, is the making visible of the divine face, or, in other words, that which is contrary to figuration.<sup>24</sup> The icon is therefore not God’s incorporation (in the sense of corpus or embodiment) but rather His incarnation (in the sense of the Latin <italic>carn</italic>, or flesh). Incarnational images, Mondzain argues, can offer a form of manifestation or visibility while preserving an ‘unsurpassable distance’ with reality, as opposed to its ‘consumable substance’.<sup>25</sup> In Chakar’s recent work, images (be they in the form of text, drawings or flashes) carry within them a similar sanctity, not because of what they directly reference or represent but rather because of the messianic potential they embody; that is, their capacity ‘to transform violence into critical liberty’.<sup>26</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In fact, speaking of his strategy of using images and text interchangeably, Chakar calls attention to the fact that in the Arabic language icons are ‘written’ rather than ‘drawn’: the terminology used to describe the creation of icons is a textual one. One writes icons, but never draws them: ‘icons are texts, albeit pictorial ones’.<sup>27</sup> Chakar adds another layer of paradox in his conception of history: ‘You will notice that I will not show you any more pictures’, he pointed out in the Sharjah iteration of <italic>One Hundred Thousand Solitudes</italic>, ‘because in messianic times, messianic times without a messiah,28 we do not need another man telling us … what to do, … to say I will be your leader and everything will be okay. No more Abdel Nasser, no more Arab Unity… <italic>Khalass</italic> [‘finish’ or ‘done with’ in Arabic].’<sup>29</sup>

            <p>‘My body is everywhere’ is no longer a metaphor for the body in fragments, but a real possibility for the body in perpetual motion. The body is everywhere, it walks around the fragments of the city, with each step encountering fragments that remind it of how things were, or how they could have been, feeling at all times the loss of something that it can never determine, seeing the world ending at every moment, and yet it cannot stop. The only option for this body is to map everything with exquisite detail, to map not the beginning of things (like maps and architectural plans usually do) but their inevitable end.<sup>30</sup>
            </p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>In the short story ‘Living in an Idea’ (2002), Chakar imagines the world as constructed by the Renaissance’s one-point perspective. He lays the case that by applying a mathematical system this perspective reduces the body and its insides to a mappable skin (a façade) with identifiable x, y and z coordinates in the physical space it inhabits. Thus, he writes, ‘a new world was constructed, and people were in it, people with specific relations to this world of things and humans’.<sup>31</sup> This notion of the correspondence of all parts in their proper place — the very logic of proportionality — links the human body to architecture, as illustrated by the well-known Vitruvian drawing. The humanist tradition traces this anthropomorphising of architecture back to Adam, who was ejected from Eden during a rainstorm. To protect himself, he joined his hands over his head, the slanted meeting point of his fingers forming the origin of the roof.<sup>32</sup> Paradoxically, despite this direct link between the human body and its surroundings — be that the home, the city or the universe — the field of architecture has failed to fully move on from its Renaissance moment when sovereignty was transferred from a God’s-eye view to that of man’s: it has essentially failed to integrate human experience and affect into its vernacular and vocabulary. In <italic>Traces of Life</italic> (2003), a book in collaboration with architect Naji Assi, Chakar argues that neighbourhoods like Rouwaysset — a working class, low-income suburb of Beirut — make bare this failure, and in particular the inability of symbols used in architectural drawings to account for makeshift alterations to structures.<sup>33</sup> Because of the inherent rigidity of architectural mark-making, more improvised structural traces of living in a space over time can only either be approximated through forms from a pre-existing repertoire of signs (an opening in the wall separating two rooms can only be represented as a window for example), or downgraded to a lesser component of the building, thus making a distinction between what is deemed to be the core structure on the one hand and later alterations to it on the other. ‘What is lost here’, according to Bernardo Zacka, ‘is the possibility that the flimsy and transient additions that inhabitants make to a building can, over time, become as fundamental as its core structural properties.’<sup>34</sup> Having taken in many waves of displaced populations (be it internally, such as people fleeing civil strife or Israeli shelling; or regionally, such as current refugees from Syria), Rouwaysset is Frankensteinian in its accumulation of seemingly unrelated alterations, parts and limbs. Indeed, its unregulated, use-driven and provisional architecture, Chakar argues, turns monstrous the proportional anthropomorphism of rational architecture.</p>
         <p>While modernism shattered the rational space of figurative, one-point perspective, this worldview certainly did not disappear without leaving a trace in our consciousness.<sup>35</sup> Victor Burgin has argued that the wave of abstraction so influential in the arts at the onset of modernity applies the same order found in spatial instruments such as maps and city plans.<sup>36</sup> Chakar’s short story ‘The Eyeless Map’ (2003) opens with a similar connection between abstract art and the onset of a new, seemingly aerial worldview: ‘Jackson Pollock’s paintings are really plans for imaginary cities.’<sup>37</sup> The story is an interplay between these two perspectival traditions as they entangle the bodies of the city’s inhabitants and the relationships between those bodies and the city’s architecture. Indeed, if Adam’s limbs are the roof, then what happens to his body when a bomb shatters his home? Chakar then quotes from Jean-Paul Sartre’s <italic>Being and Nothingness</italic> (1943): ‘The bomb which destroys my house also damages my body… This is why my body always extends … it is at the end of the cane on which I lean against the earth; it is at the end of the telescope which shows me the stars; it is … in the whole house.’<sup>38</sup> What happens to our mappable skin if the façades of our buildings are scarred by shrapnel? ‘The monstrous, fragmented body’, Chakar goes on, ‘becomes a part of the morcellated, apprehensible house (and, by extension, the city around it).’<sup>39</sup>
         </p>
         <p>He further elaborates on this fleshy metropolis in ‘Convulsive Fables’ (2003): a terrifyingly apocalyptic story of a ‘faraway city’ whose entrails were so hollowed out to accommodate corpses that the whole terrain became unstable — opening up to swallow the living, and at times spitting the dead back to the surface.<sup>40</sup> This putrid city, where ‘one could feel the stench of cadavers on every corner and every instance’, is Beirut, a city that ‘preserves all the ancient temporalities in its womb’, but which remains constantly distracted and eternally forgetful.<sup>41</sup>

         <p>As part of his project <italic>The Sky Over Beirut</italic> (2010—ongoing), Chakar conducts idiosyncratic historical tours of Beirut during which he recounts stories and histories in and around the putrid city he comes from.<sup>42</sup> It is a city filled with angels and corpses, a city that is ugly and beautiful, struggling with its histories and traditions, but also struggling with its modernity. Chakar says of his city that it is one of contradictions —at times ‘tender and beautiful’, but when it rears its other face, it is also dreadful.<sup>43</sup> The acme of Beirut’s splendour usually shines after its most horrific moments, but it is this beauty, Chakar claims, that he seeks to save through his work. He refers to his practice as an act of redemption, not for himself, but for the world.<sup>44</sup> This redeemed world would receive the fullness of its past and future in eternal flashes in the present.<sup>45</sup> It would be a mystical world with the power to bend time-space continuums, and where the public and private realms would melt away by simply walking in circles.<sup>46</sup>
