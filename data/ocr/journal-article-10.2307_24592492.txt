<plain_text><page sequence="1">Daniel Ogden (éd.), 2007. A Companion to Greek Religion. Blackwell Companions to the Andent World: Literature and Culture. Maiden, Mass., Oxford, UK &amp; Carlton, Victoria: Blackwell Publishing 2007. Pp. xxi + 497. £85.00, US$149.95. ISBN 978-1-4051-2054-8. Despite the number of introductions to Greek religion that have appeared in the recent past, this companion edited by Daniel Ogden offers a fresh contri bution to the subject. It covers a wide spectrum of topics, but the individual essays do not attempt to provide a summary or survey of the topic involved, but rather focus on questions regarding the topic. It also does not aim at a comprehensive coverage of Greek religion, but allows the individual contri butors to select the issues they consider important in the current scholarly debate. In some essays one could have wished for more information about the topic, but on the whole this approach succeeds in stimulating further interest in the subject. The volume covers the Greek world before the advent of the Roman Empire (i.e. 776-30 BC), with two 'bookend' chapters on the Near Eastern context and on reception. Part I, 'In the Background', contains only one chapter (chap. 1), on 'Greek Religion and the ancient Near East' by Scott B. Noegel, in which the vexing question of the nature of the influence of ancient Near Eastern myths and cults on the development of Greek religion is discussed. Part II is titled 'The Powers: The Gods and the Dead' and deals with the supernatural beings populating Greek religion. Ken Dowden discusses the way the collection of Olympian deities was constructed and presented in various contexts and through various media (chap. 2, Olympian gods, Olympian pantheon'). Jennifer Larson discusses the importance of the so called 'nature deities' in rural areas and their relationship to remarkable natural phenomena in chap. 3 (Ά land full of gods: nature deities in Greek religion'). In the next chapter ('Personification in Greek religious thought and practice'), Emma Stafford looks at the development of abstract entities into personified, anthropomorphic deities through the various periods of Greek culture. The dead, their relationship to the living, the cults and festivals associated with them, and the interaction between the underworld and the world of the living are discussed by D. Felton (chap. 5, The dead'). 141</page><page sequence="2">Gunnel Ekroth treats the heroes, their origins and cults, in chap. 6 ('Heroes and hero-cults'). Part III, 'Communicating with the Divine', looks at the various ways and means of establishing communication with the gods. William D. Furley discusses the different types, forms and functions of prayers and hymns (chap. 7, 'Prayers and hymns'). Chap. 8, by Jan N. Bremmer, deals with 'Greek normative animal sacrifice' as a form of communication. He describes the details of the process, but also critiques modern interpretations of sacrifice (Meuli, Burkert, Vernant). Pierre Bonnechere looks at the various forms of 'Divination' (chap. 9) and the problems associated with it (ambiguity, charlatanism, the production of false oracles). In Part IV, 'From Sacred Space to Sacred Time', aspects of the sacred in its relationship to sanctuaries and festivals are considered. Beate Dignas tries to establish what Ά day in the life of a Greek sanctuary' (chap. 10), especially the healing sanctuaries, would have looked like. Chap. 11, by Andreas Bendlin, discusses the complex - but for Greek cult highly significant - relationship between 'Purity and pollution'. Scott Scullion looks at three case studies (the Athenian Diasia, the Spartan Karneia and the Athenian Oschophoria) in an attempt to determine the significance festivals had for ancient participants (chap. 12, 'Festivals'). In chap. 13, 'Time and Greek religion', James Davidson investigates how time itself in its various facets and manifestations (the calendar based on lunar and solar cycles; mythical and historical epochs; the stages of life) structured Greek religious life. Part V, 'Local Religious Systems', explores the way the religious system differed in four different locations in the Greek world. Susan Deacy looks at Athens (chap. 14, "'Famous Athens, divine polis"; the religious system at Athens'), Nicolas Richer at Sparta (chap. 15, 'The religious system at Sparta'), Françoise Dunand at Alexandria (chap. 16, 'The religious system at Alexan dria'), while Madeleine Jost discusses Arcadia (chap. 17, 'The religious system in Arcadia'). The rich variety of religious expression encountered in these locations provides a salutary reminder that 'Greek religion' cannot adequately be described by means of generalisations based on one location, such as Athens. Part VI, 'Social Organization, the Family, and Sex', contains discussions of the ways religion structured or reflected societal forms and relationships. Charles W. Hedrick Jr. considers this question with regard to classical Athens (chap. 18, 'Religion and society in classical Greece'). In chap. 19, Janett Morgan looks at the relationships between 'Women, religion, and the home.' This is followed by Vinciane Pirenne-Delforge's discussion of the connec tion between religion and sex in chap. 20 ("'Something to do with Aphro dite": TaAphrodisia and the sacred"). 142</page><page sequence="3">Part VII, 'Mysteries and Magic', treats examples of less public, more secretive forms of religious activity. The cult of Dionysus is discussed by Susan Guettel Cole (chap. 21, 'Finding Dionysus') and the Eleusinian Mysteries of Demeter and Kore by Kevin Clinton (chap. 22, 'The Mysteries of Demeter and Kore'). Matthew W. Dickie looks at magic and at various types of magicians (chap. 23, 'Magic in Classical and Hellenistic Greece'). The final major section, Part VIII, with the open-ended title, 'Intersections: Greek Religion and ...', considers the interaction between religion and literature, philosophy and art. Thomas Harrison discusses the problems associated with using literary texts for the study of religion (chap. 24, 'Greek religion and literature'). Fritz-Gregor Hermann argues that Plato's dialogues cannot be used to reconstruct a coherent theology (chap. 25, 'Greek religion and philosophy: the god of the philosopher'), while T.H. Carpenter discusses the complex relationship between 'Greek religion and art' (chap. 26). The volume concludes with an 'Epilogue' in Part IX in which Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones analyses the way mythological subjects are interpreted in modern film (chap. 27, 'Gods and the silver screen: cinematic represen tations'). This collection of essays is a welcome addition to the existing books on Greek religion. Both advanced students and scholars will find it a useful introduction to the state of research on the subject. Johan Thorn University of Stellenbosch 143</page></plain_text>
