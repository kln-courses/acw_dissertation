<plain_text><page sequence="1">LIKENESS AND BEYOND Portraits from Africa and the World The Center for African Art, New York February 14-August 12, 1990 Reviewed by Mary Jo Aroldi _ i _5 := "Portraiture in its broadest sense is the repre- sentation of an individual, living or dead, real or imagined, in drawing, painting, or sculpture, by a rendering of his physical or moral traits, or both." This working defini- tion of portraiture opens the section on the topic in the Encyclopedia of World Art (1966: vol. 11, p. 469). Following it are nearly forty pages of essays on the complex and changing definition of the portrait in various cultures over time. It is noteworthy, though not sur- prising, that the one on "Portraiture among Primitive Peoples," which covers the prehis- toric and the modern periods, is the most generalized and highly conjectural. "Likeness and Beyond: Portraits from Africa and the World" attempted to address this underresearched area of African art by considering African portraiture within world portrait traditions. Jean Borgatti, in collabora- tion with Richard Brilliant, developed the idea for both the exhibition and its themes, and Allen Wardwell selected the 105 objects displayed at the Center for African Art. Roughly sixty percent of the pieces were African sculptures, which formed the core for the discussion of the portrait genre in Africa. The remaining group, which included sculp- tures as well as paintings, photographs, and prints, represented portraits chosen from var- ious periods of Western art ranging from ancient Rome to the contemporary era and epochs in Pre-Columbian, Japanese, Chinese, Tibetan, and Indian art. Following the intro- ductory gallery, the exhibition was organized into separate sections devoted to emblematic portraits, generic portraits, representational portraits, portraits as history, and portraiture and perception. Through the juxtaposition of objects and accompanying wall texts, the introductory gallery established the central thesis and framework for the entire exhibition. The objects on display included a twentieth-cen- tury Yao mask from Mozambique, an early seventeenth-century Tibetan painting of a Lama and donor, an archaeological Akan ter- racotta head dated to the nineteenth century, an eighteenth-century bust of Voltaire by Houdon, a reconstruction of a Mossi funeral effigy from a photograph taken in Burkina Faso in 1985, and a 1987 mixed-media piece titled Portrait of Warhol by Armand Arman. In this gallery, the curators defined three categories of African portraits. Each of the next three sections of the exhibit compared one of these types with examples drawn from Africa and other areas of the world. An emblematic portrait does not depend on an accurate depiction of the human form. Instead, the objects or symbols that constitute it, which are associated with a particular indi- vidual, define it as a portrait. Generic por- traits confine themselves to individuals whose features are standardized according to the artistic conventions of a culture. (Most of the African examples in the exhibit fell within this category.) Representational portraits, on the other hand, strive for a physiognomic resemblance to their subject. African objects featured in the discussion of each of these portrait genres, together with the panel texts, specifically established a set of formal relationships and artistic intentions shared by both the African and the non- African objects. For example, the Mossi effigy and the Arman Portrait of Warhol were paired as examples of emblematic portraits; the Akan head and the Tibetan painting A Lama of the Shakaya Red Hat Sect with a Donor, as generic portraits; and the Yao mask and the Bust of Voltaire fell within the category of rep- resentational portraits. The wall texts in the introductory gallery cautioned readers that these categories are fluid, and that in Africa it is often difficult to distinguish emblematic from generic portraits. This warning was borne out by those sections of the exhibition. "Likeness and Beyond" also utilized clever political and didactic strategies. Politically, African objects were assigned a defining role, rather than the peripheral one generally accorded them in surveys of world art. Didactically, the curators presumed, probably correctly, that most visitors would be unacquainted with the class of African objects exhibited here. Moving viewers between the lesser-known African objects and the more familiar Western and Oriental works in order to point out the culturally spe- cific nature of portraiture eliminated the sense of unease they might have felt when confronting the unfamiliar. The curators unquestioningly embraced the idea that portraiture is a category valid in all cultures. This wholehearted acceptance, coupled with their concern with making African art central in art historical studies, risks a new kind of art historical imperialism. Their failure to critically assess whether or not portraiture is a universal subverts one of the key messages of label texts throughout the exhibit-namely, that portraits are a cul- ture- and time-bound artistic form. Re- formulating the definition of an individual (central to the curators' definition of a por- trait) so that it includes the various notions of the person operative in different African soci- eties ignores the very historicity-and pecu- liarly Western nature-of this definition, and, consequently, of the category of portraiture. Although this was an appealing exhibit that included many delectable objects, it often fell into the trap of creating false similes between objects from different cultures, places, and time periods. Two comparisons of African and non-African examples in the introductory gallery are cases in point. The first is the pairing of the Mossi effigy and the Arman Portrait of Warhol. The reconstruction of the Mossi effigy consisted of a crossed-stick frame covered with an actual grand boubou and hat. Around the neck of the figure hung a photograph of the deceased. Leaning against it were several guns, part of an animal skele- ton, a bow, and a walking stick. The Portrait of Warhol was a box-framed collage composed of a pair of black trousers, a black turtleneck, a white-blond wig, multiple pairs of eyeglasses, paint cans, brushes, film and cameras, play money, and so on-all objects once intimately associated with Andy Warhol. What dis- turbed me here was that the wall labels made no mention of what was clearly a critical ele- ment in the Mossi effigy and totally absent from the Arman piece-a prominently dis- played photograph of the deceased. In defin- ing this Mossi image as an emblematic portrait, you cannot just ignore the inclusion of the photograph. This memorial effigy was created in 1985, not in some seamless, time- less, "traditional" Africa. Any discussion of it must, at the very least, acknowledge the long- standing history of photography in Africa and recognize the complex nature of the transfor- mation in image-making that photography has stimulated on the continent. There seemed to be two different artistic processes at work in these pieces that resonated not with one another, but with the history of image-making within each artist's culture. A second and equally problematic exam- ple involved the Yao mask matched with Houdon's Bust of Voltaire. These two sculp- tures were presented as examples of repre- sentational portraits. However, the case label accompanying the Yao mask informed the viewer that there is no documentary evidence available to verify that it was ever intended to represent an individual, even though the descriptive naturalism it embodies suggests this possibility.

PHOTO: THE CENTER FOR AFRICAN ART 81</page><page sequence="2">exceptionally arresting sculpture, I wondered if the sheer visual force of its pairing with a documented and naturalistically rendered eighteenth-century bust overrode any con- cern on the viewer's part that identifying it as a portrait is pure conjecture. The overwhelming lack of documentation for individual pieces in the exhibit severely weakened its thesis that portraiture is a central impulse in image-making in Africa. The cura- tors do make a strong case for these objects as portraits based on recent research on Benin tusks and field evidence for one specific Fon asen, which was commissioned as a portrait. But without documentation, the identification of the Yoruba Egungun mask, the Dogon stat- ues, the Baule entertainment masks, the Dan spoons, the Shango dance wands, the Chokwe maiden masks, and the Akan and Ife archaeo- logical material as portraits remains pure con- jecture on the curators' part. For example, while field evidence suggests that some, but not all, Baule entertainment masks were carved as portraits of celebrated dancers, none of those displayed were documented as por- traits. What, then, does their inclusion tell us about Baule portraiture? The curators moved to somewhat safer ground in presenting sculptures and paint- ings as historical and social documents. In this gallery, the juxtaposition of African and non-African pieces was less problematic, because the discussions of rank, class, and gender were framed in a manner culturally and historically specific to individual objects. However, I found the final gallery, "Por- traiture and Perception," very unsuccessful. In attempting to address the question of cul- turally specific perceptual systems, the labels grouped all of Africa's cultures under the rubric of "Africans" and lumped all Western societies into one regardless of period or place. The lead label in this section set off my internal alarms when it stated, "One study suggests that Africans...." At their best, the cross-cultural compar- isons should have visually stimulated and delighted the general viewer. Yet they also risked propagating false information about African objects, thereby creating false similes between not only the various African pieces, but also the African and non-African ones. Because of the historical shifts in the way Western society has defined portraiture, the complex nature of perception and image- making worldwide, and our lack of docu- mentation and field evidence for far too many of the African objects in the exhibit, the implied similarities among these objects often seemed too facile and left me with a pro- found sense of unease. The exhibition as a whole brought to mind Magritte's surrealist painting Les Trahison des Images (Ceci n'est pas une pipe). The majority of the objects included are indeed anthropomorphic images, but can we confidently state that they are all really portraits? objects that would have supported their the- sis may not have been available for loan; complex issues discussed at length in the cat- alogue may have been drastically reduced to a few general paragraphs on a text panel in the galleries. "Likeness and Beyond" thus raised the question of whether its complex topic can even be adequately treated in an exhibition. Despite its weaknesses, it offered some important insights: the cross-cultural juxtapositions brought up serious issues for scholars about the universality of art histori- cal categories, while the lack of field studies and documentation about whole groups of African objects suggested a number of critical directions for future research on the arts of Africa.

BLADES OF BEAUTY AND DEATH African Art Forged in Metal Mesa College Art Gallery, San Diego, California February 2-March 7, 1990 Reviewed by Elisabeth L. Cameron ~C(I~$I~IPbPI _. - Can knives be beautiful? Can they be art? These are the questions asked by "Blades of Beauty and Death," a recent exhibition curat- ed by Barbara W. Blackmun and Jacques Hautelet. African knifes are more than utilitarian objects for domestic use and warfare. As important items of regalia, they bestow authority on appropriate candidates. Used in rituals, they become part of a corpus of sacred arts. Blades were also used as currency throughout much of precolonial central Africa. Both functional and nonfunctional forms exist, the more elaborate having pierced and decorated blades and handles. Perhaps the best known are the throwing knives, which incorporate several blades of different shapes on the same weapon. The basic materials used are iron and copper, metals that have been worked by African blacksmiths since very early times: copper dates back to 2000 B.C., iron to 500 B.C. Because of the creative power exhibited in the act of extracting ore, of smelting it into usable iron and copper, and of shaping the metal into objects of beauty and use, black- smiths take on ritual roles and often super- natural powers in many African cultures. Although limited to one fairly small room and drawing from only a single private col- lection of African knives, this show gave the viewer a new appreciation of the knives' aes- thetic value. The exhibition layout was deceptively simple. The weapons were dis- played on stands that lined three of the walls, giving the effect of soldiers marching in step around the room. Four spectacular examples were placed in the center of the gallery. The knives were carefully arranged so that the evolution from one shape to another could be seen among just several successive examples. The room, painted a simple gray, was devoid of wall decoration, except for two photomu- rals and several didactic labels at the en- trance. This deliberately stark background was intended to focus attention on the knives as aesthetic objects. With any other design decision, the delicate and subtle beauty of the metalwork would have been lost. The constraints imposed on curators in any exhibition are severe, and must be taken into consideration in the final analysis of a show's success or failure. Documented 82</page></plain_text>
