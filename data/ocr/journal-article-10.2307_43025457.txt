Their poetry, the main characteristic of which is ambiguity, explores the danger zones of women's departure from patriarchal concepts. In search of a new self which is buried within the social self and which appears both as a cherished and a feared double, they court negation, destruction, and death. Destruction is omnipresent and turns as easily against the self as it can be projected upon the external en- vironment, which in turn threatens the persona with reification, disintegration, and engulfment. Self-hatred is as frequent as self-assertion and this frequency of self-loathing creates an atmosphere of disgust and suffering. Victories are rare and never final. Although they challenge the patriarchal order their world- view is still dichotomized into the male versus the female poles. Being a woman and a writer nowadays often means being at odds with everything society accepts as given, including ourselves. In the basic triangular relationship the artist has toward the world, the self, and language, each of these factors be- comes questionable, unacceptable in its predefined forms; each demands a radically new assessment. As has been frequently pointed out1, there are models to go back to, women's literature has a longer history than feminism. However, the loss of orientation in the universe and in society that has become acute in most contem- porary literature intensifies the problematics women writers are faced with. For a woman self-definition in a predominantly male-oriented culture still means non-acceptance, refusal, negation, before any affirmative stance can be achieved. If this scepticism is escalated by the existential scepticism and the sense of loss pervading most of contemporary writing, it easily precipitates the writer into the experience of being assaulted by the world at large and disintegrating under its onslaught. The world itself, however, loses its solidity as soon as the writer cannot take its definitions and appearances any longer for granted; and with the problem- atization of reality the existence of the self becomes precarious. The female writer who is conscious of her predicament as a woman finds herself questioning not only the social structure and their cultural and ideological bases but also the tool with which she tackles them - her language. For language, too, reflects the society she is at war with and the collective consciousness against 1 Cf. Emily Stipes Watts, The Poetry of American Women from 1632-1945.

Furthermore, her own consciousness, her own self is still very much a product of this society and reshaping it is a painful, at times losing battle. The work of such poets as Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, Luise Glück, and Diane Wakoski has been criticized for the poeťs self-defeating, self-destructive attitude, their courting of death, their self-depreciation often taking on forms of sado- masochism and self-disgust. Yet any effective revolution of consciousness, every rebirth, presupposes a private apocalypse, and poets like Sexton, Plath, and Glück have enacted this apocalypse for us. "Any writer," Sexton says in an interview with Patricia Marx, "any artist I'm sure is obsessed with death, a prerequisite for life."2 The focus on Anne Sexton and Luise Glück, two female poets of two successive generations whose writing overlaps in many ways, will show the similarity of their concerns and problems as well as the differences of their solutions; these are very much generational differences as feminism is evolving. Both poets are intensely aware of their predicaments as women, of the roles society expects them to assume and the pitfalls on the way to integrating or discarding these roles. The difference between them lies in the degree of their defiance, the targets of their anger, the objects of their loves and sufferings. When Sexton's first volume was published, "confessional poetry" was a convenient tag helping to categorize her within a poetic main-stream as a disciple of Ted Berryman and Robert Lowell. Anything she had to say about her situation as a woman was absorbed by the claim of autobiographical confessionalism. Although all her poetry enacts the struggle of a woman trying to break free of the limitations and preconceived definitions society and its internalized commandments impose on her, Sexton rejects identification with the feminist movement: Sometimes I feel like another creature, hardly a woman. I can't be a modern woman. I'm a Victorian teenager at heart. We [American women) have much more freedom and we speak up [ ... ļ I like to speak up.3 Throughout her writing this uneasiness about her double role as a woman and a poet surfaces in an ambivalence toward the self and the exponents of a male society. She rejoices in her body and loathes it, she subjects herself exultingly to her male lover and hates him, she breaks free of her image as a housewife and feels guilty, she tries to free herself from external claims and watches in horror as her self is losing contours. Luise Glück, whose first volume was published in the late sixties, escaped the label of confessionalism, although her poetry is as personal, as anguished, as in- tensely charged with private emotions as Sexton's. She too deals with death and madness. The underlying mood running throughout her first two volumes, First- born (1968) and The House on the Marshland (1976)4, is that of resigned despair, emptiness, and loneliness as inescapable human conditions juxtaposed with an equally desperate search for a meaning, a pattern behind the random cruelty of the world. Like Sexton she courts death and longs for rebirth which her un- 2 Patricia Marx, "Interview with Anne Sexton", Hudson Review, vol.

Unlike Sexton she speaks as a woman who angrily rejects whatever image a patriarchal society tries to impose her: housewife, mother, lover, daughter. Though she belongs to a younger, angrier generation, Glück has also failed to rid herself of an internalized loathing for her female body, her rebellious self. The necessity of rejecting, re- fusing, fighting free often leaves her with a sense of bitter fatigue and futility. However, in the few poems in which the landscape of despair turns into one of hope and potential rebirth, it is not Sexton's religious mysticism she offers but the birth of a new woman. Very often this rebirth is a violent wrench, a sudden unexpected burst of light, painful, apocalyptic and ambivalent even in its victory. You have only to let it happen: that cry - release, release - like the moon wrenched out of earth and rising full in its circle of arrows until they come before you like dead things, saddled with flesh, and you above them, wounded and dominant. ("Messengers", HM, p. 18) Neither Sexton's nor Glück's poetry explicitly proclaims any political or social commitment: People have to find out who they are before they confront national issues [ . . . ļ I write about human emotions; I write about interior events, not historical ones [ . . . ] A black emotion can become a white emotion. It is a crisis for the indi- vidual as well as the nation.5 Similarly Glück rarely is programmatically feminist. However, any interaction, any confrontation with the world is political. The perception of reality, of nature, of society, and of the self reflects the power-struggle between external and internal forces. In this struggle in which the persona is often divided against herself, Glück and Sexton are unanimous: The self, the "real me", is the victim of a hostile, brutalizing environment, victories are rare and never final. Both poets live in a world that threatens the persona with extinction: Reification6, disintegration, suffocation, or engulfment often turning into sadistic cannibalism. Like Sylvia Plath, they live in a landscape of projection. Reality becomes a screen on which their fears and their visions of destruction are acted out. External objects and the natural environment are not envisioned as something given as points of refer- ence, static, reliable. They are dynamic forces, animated, anthropomorphic, some- times even personified in the highly personalized encounter with the persona. In this encounter nature bears the features of the personal state of mind or body: 5 Anne Sexton, "The Art of Poetry. Interview." Paris Review, vol. 52 (Summer 1971 ), p. 191 . 6 By reification I mean the turning of a sentient creature, such as a human being, into an object. The myth of Daphne is the prototype of reification.</page><page sequence="4">1 34 Waltraud Mitgutsch My one dozen roses are dead they have ceased to menstruate. They hang there like little dried up blood clots. ("The Break", Love Poems, p. 24)7 In a number of poems Sexton uses the archetypal identification of nature with the female body projecting her vulnerability, her own sexuality upon natural phenomena. The magnolias had sat once, each in a pink dress looking, of course, at the ceiling. For weeks the buds had been sure-bodied as the twelve-year-old flower girl I was. I could see that none were clumsy. I could see that each was tight and firm. Not one of them had trickled blood - waiting as polished as gull beaks, as closed as all that. Yet one night in the April night Someone (Someone!) kicked each bud open - to disprove, to mock, to puncture! The next day they were all hot-colored, moist, not flawed in fact. Then they no longer huddled, they forgot to hide. Tense as they had been, they were flags, gaudy, chafing in the wind. ("The Wedding Night", Live or Die, pp. 60-61 ) In this identification of the magnolia blossoms with the young girl forcefully initiated into womanhood, nature becomes a metaphor of the persona's exposure and vulnerability. It also manifests an ambivalence toward sexual violation that can be traced throughout her poetry, a certain pleasure at inflicted cruelty, a sadomasochistic indulgence in pain.8 More frequently, however, nature itself is the assailant, menacing and demonic, crowding in on the persona. Its phenomena become murderous instruments aimed at the persona's destruction, "metallic rains kept on [ . . . ] the dreadful tulips / swung on their hinges [...]" ("Killing the Spring", Folly, p. 36), "birds turn into plumber's tools [ . . . ] a wind turns into a tracheotomy" ("The Hex", Folly, p. 24), "the grass speaks, [ . . . ] the blades extend / and reach my way. / The sky breaks. / It sags and breathes upon my face." ("Noon Walk on the Asylum Lawn", Bedlam, p. 39). While nature assumes an aggressive life of its own, the persona is turned into an object; she is drained of the life that instead flows over into the objective world to destroy her. Whichever way she turns, whether she identifies with nature or projects her fears onto it, the persona remains the victim. 7 Abbreviated quotations: To Bedlam and Part Way Back (Boston, 1960) will be quoted as Bedlam ; All My Pretty Ones (Boston, 1961 ) as Pretty Ones ; The Book of Folly (Boston, 1972) as Folly ; The Death Notebook (Boston, 1974) as Notebk The Awful Rowing To- ward God (Boston, 1975) as Rowing-, other volumes quoted: Love Poems (Boston, 1967), Live or Die (Boston, 1966). 8 Cf.

It is a bleak landscape of death, lacking the occasional sensuousness of Sexton's nature, the sexual overtones, the identification. Only rarely is nature benevolent9, even flowers are messengers of death. But death also has its flower. It is called contagion, it is red or white, the color of japónica - ("Japónica", HM, p. 47) Glück thoroughly reverses the romantic conceptions of traditional nature poetry. It is not only the wintry landscape of poems like "Early December in Croton-on- Hudson" (F, p. 13) "Late Snow" (F, p. 48), "All Hallows" (HM, p. 11) that divests all phenomena of color and pares them down to "the bone dice / of blown gravel clicking" ("Early December in Croton-on-Hudson", F., p. 13). Spring season holds no promise either. Vegetative and human life is contaminated as soon as it comes into being. Disgust is the pervasive reaction to nature; it becomes uninhabitable: "the crocus spreads like cancer / This will be the daeth of me. I feel the leaves close in." ("Easter Season", F., p. 44). Like Sexton's, Glück's persona sees herself threatened by a destructively hostile environment. She mistrusts it. "Unsafe" is the keyword of her defensive attitude. Whereas in Sexton's poetry we find the occasional nature-persona analogy as a form of harmony or as a conspiracy against male aggression, in Glück's poems nature tends to side with the aggressor. In "Bridal Piece" (F, p. 22), a poem strongly reminiscent of Sexton's "The Wedding Night", all the disgust and fear felt for male brutality is projected upon the environment: [ . . . ] the moon lurched like searchlights, like his murmurings across my brain - He had to have his way. As down the beach the wet wind snored . . . ("Bridal Piece", F, p. 22) In Glück's universe every detail is a carefully chosen projection of her inner land- scape. The phenomena of nature are assembled as chiffres10 of her private mythol- ogy. Even poems in which the persona is absent betray more of the persona's state of mind than of the objective reality described. Her disgust, her fear of sterility and paralysis are projected upon nature in images of decay and stasis such as "sagging light [ . . . ] stalled at / vanishes [ . . . ] the drained sun / sinks through insects coalesced / to mist, mosquitoes / rippling over the muddy ocean" ("Meri- dian", F. p. 47). Very often her disgust seems to be an extrapolation of self-loathing or a revulsion at the tediousness of life in general. The tendency to project her internalized self-hatred upon the external world bans bèauty, stifles the growth of anything 9 Exceptions are: "Messengers" (HM, p. 18) and "The Undertaking" (HM, p. 33) 10 A chiffre is a hermetic metaphor the meaning of which grows out of the private mythology of the author rather than out of the received tradition of any culture.</page><page sequence="6">1 36 Waltraud Mitgutsch new and undefiled. The persona becomes part of the general disintegration and waste, "gray, glued to her dream / kitchen among bones, among these / dripping willows squatted to imbed / a bulb" ("La Force", F, p. 35). Her self-hatred is directed against those selves that hold her in bondage: against herself as a lover, as a housewife, as a mother, and as a daughter. Frequently this rejection of a claim made on her or of a self-imposed role, is conveyed in metaphors of eating that turn into images of cannibalism. The persona becomes the sacrificial victim from whom life is drained. While "overfed / late roses gag on fertilizer", her "life is sealed" ("La Force"). After a sinister operation performed by an impersonal male torturer-surgeon, the persona sees herself as a disembodied, flattened-out tear along a paper: [ . . . ] Beyond the sterilizer his enormous hands swarmed, carniverous for prey Past cutlery I saw my body stretching like a tear along the paper. ("The Egg", F, p. 4) Whenever she encounters the world, be it nature or society, the persona is victim- ized, threatened or suffocated. Her lover is a malignant growth, - "It lives in me. / You live in me. Malignant." ("Hesitate to Call", F, p. 7). Her mother becomes a vampire risen from her childhood - "she surges like her yeast dough through the door / way shrieking It is I, love . . ." ("My Life Before Dawn", F, p. 24). Similarly she envisions her family ready to consume her flesh on the Sunday dinner table (Firstborn", F, p. 34). Glück's landscape, too, is demonically animated, it bears the sinister physiognomy of death devouring the persona ("Easter Season", F, p. 44; "Inlet", F, p. 52; "Meridian", F, p. 47; "Archipelago", HM, p. 15) or reducing it to a state of cata- tonia. Yet there is still another force at work, nameless and elusive; never material- izing it remains a vacant spot in the self or in the universe or in both simultaneous- ly. The persona regards it with ambivalence: In "The Wound" (F, p. 11) it appears to be hidden in the center of the self, a foreign substance or a mysterious sickness unto death afflicting the persona. It reduces her to a crust [ . . . ] clots of flies", a world closing in on the self with the claustrophobic constriction many of Glück's poems have in common: "The prison falls in place" ("The Wound"). While the persona lies paralyzed, almost disembodied, her horizon confined by the "sticky curtains" of the sick-room, reality starts to disintegrate, "ripe things sway in the light / parts of plants, leave / fragments". Glück shares this reversal of dynamics with Sexton and Plath. There, too, the persona is paralyzed, turned into an object or ossified while reality gains its own destructive life assailing the immobile self. This nameless force surfaces again and again in Glück's poetry, lending it depth but also a vexing uncertainty. However, it is never identified with death as Plath's "otherness" frequently is. Sometimes it bears resemblance to the persona; it be- comes her alter ego, the loathed part of herself, the part that ties her to a hateful existence, that seals her life. It can also become a hidden center of meaning which, if only it could be revealed, would bring salvation. In "Messengers" (HM, p. 18)</page><page sequence="7">Women in Transition 137 natural phenomena become chiffres of this unknown dimension. They promise freedom and epiphany, but they remain signs, their vanishing point toward which they are moving is never revealed.11 Sexton's poetry, too, has moments of epiphany, but her centers of meaning are less vague, less ambivalent. In her early poetry life and rebirth very often are gifts of love. The persona feels herself revitalized and redefined by the touch of her lover ("Touch", "Kiss", Love Poems, p. 1,3). In her late volumes she finds hope of salvation in a religious mysticism. There are, however, several poems in which rebirth is an entirely internal process independent of external forces. The persona, the woman becomes her own creator. In "Live" (Live or Die, pp. 87-90) the turning point from death to life is pinpointed by a physiological metaphor - ovulation: Today life opened inside me like an egg and there inside after considerable digging I found the answer. As in Glück's poems of epiphany, the assertion of life is accompanied by a meta- phorical burst of sun and fire contrasting the usual landscape of reduction and paralysis: There was the sun, her yolk moving feverishly. An image that often appears as a metaphor of liberation, of the suppressed self triumphantly asserting herself is that of the witch. It is a recurrent image in women's poetry and it usually marks the emergence of the "dark self", the self in eclipse, the "real me" over the social self defined by externally imposed roles. Sexton's attitude is ambivalent. In such poems as "Live", "Moon Song, Woman Song" ( Love Poems, p. 31) or "Her Kind (Bedlam, p. 21) the witch becomes a symbol of release, of self-assertion, in which confining roles are cast aside, in which the natural, suppressed woman and her channelled sexuality break forth. The witch, however, can turn into a vampire (cf. "Again and Again and Again", Love Poems, p. 29); "Mother and Daughter", Folly, p. 11; "Oh", Folly, p. 7). The motif of the Doppelgänger plays an important part in Sexton's poetry. The alter ego, too, is regarded ambivalently, with either the loathing and sadomaso- chism with which the persona so frequently turns against herself or with the fond indulgence for the "real me", the innocent, vulnerable child in the grown woman. The schizophrenic attitude toward the self does not derive exclusively from the incompatibility of conflicting roles and self-images. One fact of it can be traced on a broader scale throughout Sexton's poetry: her dichotomized thinking, her view of the world as split into the male versus the female poles that are forever entangled in a love-hate relationship. In "The Other" (Folly, p. 30 f.) the alter ego is addressed as "Mr. Doppelgänger. My brother. My spouse. / Mr. Doppelgänger. My enemy. My lover." The alter ego is male; he is out there and simultaneously part of the self: 11 Cf. "Poem" (HM, p. 26), "The Undertaking" (HM, p. 33).</page><page sequence="8">1 38 Waltraud Mitgutsch Under my bowels, yellow with smoke, it waits. Under my eyes, those milk bunnies, it waits. The "other" anwers to C.G. Jung's definition of the animus, the internalized and suppressed male component in the female psyche. It is the self that is hidden from the world, incompatible with the social self that "puts on a cocktail dress". But unlike the witch it is destructive, suicidal and cynical if it gets the upper hand. It is a foreign substance, a parasite, sapping the persona of the power to act auto- nomously. It is a bully and a torturer - "it is a thumbscrew / its hatred makes it clairvoyant" - and there is no way in which the two selves can be reconciled, for the "other" is too powerful to be held in balance by the persona. However, since the alter ego remains part of the self, its appearance is often ac- companied by an intense feeling of guilt and self-loathing. In "The Hex" (Folly, p. 24 f.) the evil self compulsively perverts every attempt at achieving happiness and harmony. The pattern its witchcraft follows is ubiquitous in Sexton's poetry. Everything living is turned into dead matter and becomes a function of destruction, whereas objects are animated and become sinister and threatening. Reality is concealed by distorting masks. The self no longer remains an organic totality. With the reification of its part it starts to disintegrate, and fear of chaos floods the persona. In Sexton's world-view disintegration and chaos are always imminent. If the inimical force is not the alter ego, it is a sinister, external force in nature or in objects having turned into anthropomorphous demons. They threaten to transform the persona into stone or to explode her into splinters; the "other" is allied with the world and both are masks of death. In several poems the "other" reveals itself as death. In those poems the attitude of the persona is highly ambivalent. Death is the cherished infant, nurtured and loved but also dreaded with fascinated revulsion: Death, you lie in my arms like a cherub I rock, I rock glass eye, ice eye, primordial eye, lava eye, pin eye, break eye, how you stare back. ("Death Baby", Notebk., p. 20) Yet death is even closer than the baby she cradles in her arms: You know all about me you have worn my underwear. You have read my newspaper. His smell is our smell. "I" becomes "you" and gradually "we". Death is internalized and transforms the persona into an object: "We are stone / We are carved, a pietà" (p. 21). The</page><page sequence="9">Women in Transition 1 39 image of the mother with her children, completed and lifeless as a marble pietà is strongly reminiscent of Plath's "Edge" The woman is perfected Her dead body wears the smile of accomplishment the illusion of a Greek necessity flowers in the scrolls of her toga Each dead child coiled, a white serpent. ["Edge", Ariel (London, 1961) p. 84] In a number of poems, however, the relationship between the persona and her Doppelgänger is reversed. The alter ego is a mask dictated by social conventions; it is the self presented to the world, wheras the "real me" is the naked self, inno- cent, untouched and vulnerable ("Mr. Mine", Love Poems, p. 43). Yet the existence of this "real me" is precarious. It is easily smothered by the layers of masks, by the "plaster doll" with "nylon legs, luminous arms / and some advertised clothes [ . . . ] who should smile, who should shift gears / should spring the doors open in a wholesome disorder" ("Self in 1958", Live or Die, p. 73-74). The conflict of roles, the conflict of selves makes large portions of life and reality uninhabitable. It makes relationships guilt-laden and threatens the persona with loss of self and loss of reality. The image of the housewife invariably triggers a chain-reaction of metaphorical transformations both of the environment and the persona. The domestic environment reduces the persona to an object acted upon, directed by external forces - "someone plays with me / plants me in the all-electric kitchen [ . . . ] I am walled in solid by their noise" ("Self in 1958"). Her body or rather parts of it no longer cohering organically are described in metaphors of household utensils or food. In the bizarre dream-imagery of "The Death Baby" the self alternately becomes food" put on a platter and laid / be- tween the mayonnaise and the bacon", and the bone at the dogs' party "laid out in their kennel / like a fresh turkey" (Notebk., p. 17). As in Glück's poetry, the fear behind this imagery is that of being used like an object, reduced to a function, devoured by demands. Assuming any conventional female role and losing self-control are almost synonymous. In the poem "The Red Shoes" (Folly, p. 28/29) the essence of womanhood is described as that of being acted upon, of living in hiding, of being victimized. The red shoes become a metaphor for taking on the plight of women handed down through generations: They are not mine, They are my mother's. Her mother's before. Before the persona puts on the shoes, the world is still whole and it is hers: "Every- thing that was calm / is mine". Bur wearing the red shoes, a woman's fate is no longer determined by her own decisions: All those girls who wore the red shoes,</page><page sequence="10">140 Waltraud Mi tgu tsch each boarded a train that would not stop. They all danced like trout on a hook. They were played with. However, Sexton's tendency to exult in suffering carries the imagery of victimiza- tion even further in a grotesque fantasy of self-dismemberment: They tore off their ears like safety pins. Their arms fell off them and became hats. and they danced forth as if they were proud. Surely people proclaimed, surely they are mechanical, otherwise .... Here again, reification and disintegration are closely related. The dancing women become a meeting place of functions, their limbs loosely connected objects, their center lying outside in somebody else's will: "They were wound up like a cobra that sees you". The poem enacting a small apocalypse, a "death dance" is an allegory of women's lives: the extinction of a self, the loss of self-control, the functionalization and mechanization of their response, all of which adds up to the disintegration of the self and the loss of a genuine relationship to reality. The feeling of becoming somebody's object is ubiquitous is Sexton's work. In the poems exploring the mother-daughter relationship, the suppressed hostility both toward her mother ("Double Image", Bedlam, p. 53-56) and her daughter ("Mother and Daughter", Folly , p. 11) is acted out in images of reification. In the poem to her mother, both mother and daughter are frozen into effigies of each other's alter ego: And this was the cave of the mirror, that double woman who stares at herself, as if she were petrified in time - two ladies in umber chairs. ( Bedlam , p. 60) In the ambivalent poem to her daughter love and hatred lie even closer together. Yet the ma in -accusati on is that of having been used, worn out, emptied like a burglarized safe. Sexton's attitude toward being made somebody's object is not altogether and consistently negative. Self-denial, the refusal of involvement, too, cause ossification. It has been said that "she is always on the run from one thing to another, ex- pressing in this the contours of an instinct for escape and purification.12 Yet her impulse to flee is counteracted by an equally strong "Daphne-impulse". Her dream of freedom is stalled by guilt and a partly dreaded, partly longed-for paralysis, a form of death-wish, a catatonia extinguishing her tortured consciousness. Becom- ing an object can be either a punishment or a relief. It is a punishment if it is the result of unaccomplished or refused love as in "Where I live in this honorable house of the Laurel tree" (Bedlam, p. 24) or "Old Dwarf Heart" (Pretty Ones, p. 10) and a relief in poems like "Angel of Flight and Sleigh Bells": 12 Robert Boyers, "Live or Die.

What unusual luck! {Folly, p. 59) In her poetry exploring male-female relationships Sexton's ambivalence is even more complex. The imagery in her volume Love Poems (1967) uses conventional stereotypes along with starti ingly aggressive imagery. The female body becomes a building, her lover the architect ("The Touch", p. 2; "Mr. Mine", p. 43). If her body is a boat, he hoists and rigs her ("The Kiss", p. 3). If her nerves are musical instruments, he is the composer ("The Kiss"). The woman is the man's slave and his princess ("Us", p. 41); she is the eternal seductress and exhibitionist ("Moon Song, Woman Song", p. 31) and above all she is vessel, inner space, chamber, container. The male counterpart on the other hand, is the creator, the dynamic, life-giving force whose touch revitalizes the female body and assembles its part into a functioning totality. Before today my body was useless Now it's tearing at its square corners Zing! A resurrection. ("The Kiss") Yet the male is also the cruel enemy, the brutal rapist and the persona regards him with the ambivalent mixture of fascination and fear she exhibits toward all phenomena threatening her with extinction. Whenever pain is inflicted, destruction is wrought, or violence is committed, the victim is female, the aggressor is male. Death is frequently associated with images of sexuality and in several poems it/he comes as a lover13 ("Imitations of Drowning", Live or Die, p. 16; "For Mr. Death Who Stands with his Door Open", Notebk., p. 19). As in Glück's poetry, the persona speaks of herself as the sacrificial victim offered up in a cannibalistic ritual. Food imagery, an intense feeling of revulsion and sadism are closely linked. In "Imitations of Drowning" death is described as "that old butcher"; the "Wife- beater" is "chewing little red pieces of my heart" (Folly, p. 13), while in "The Red Shoes" women become "trout on a hook". Throughout Sexton's work blood, pain, and open wounds are frequent metaphors for the female body and the female experience of the self.14 Her poetry has been described as intensely physical15, yet this physicality is as often that of torture and pain as of an exulting in her own sexuality. Often female sexuality is projected onto a larger screen than the female body. It becomes cosmic, it becomes a principle of nature pulling the individual into 13 The image of death as a lover has become a topos not only in women's poetry (Emily Dickinson, Sylvia Plath etc.) but in the tradition of Western poetry and art as well: Death and the Maiden in medieval painting, in Schubert, in European literature. 14 Cf.

In these poems the sexualized universe is apprehended with the ambi- valent feeling of fear and regressive longing. Losing herself in the engulfing embrace of nature, the sea, the moon, the night, all of which are archetypal images of the female, the persona experiences a sense of wholeness and peace that is rare in Sexton's poetry. In this wholeness even the male-female dichotomy is reconciled and a being emerges who is both a woman and a man, abandoned to that great force and spilling it back out. He is undefiled, the eternal listener who has cried back into the earth. ("Lose the Earth", Live or Die, p. 35-37) In these poems the earth opens like a cave, like a womb to receive the persona, to mother her, to heal her fragmented self. Glück's poetry is more radical in its rejection of roles and dependencies and con- sequently less ambivalent than Sexton's. In her poetry there is no sheltering harbor and nobody can make the persona whole but she herself. Love between men and women is at best a tedious bondage. Its constriction is described in images of claustrophobia and revulsion: "Saw you throbbing / in my syrup" ("Hesitate to Call", F. p. 7). Marriage is imprisonment in which every action congeals into an instrument of torture: Time and again, time and again I tie my heart to that headboard while my quilted cries harden against his hand. ("The Edge", F, p. 17) Whereas in Sexton's poetry imagery of encasement holds a balance between nurtur- ing nest and suffocating coffin, chiffres of claustrophobia abound in Glück's work. The alter ego the child she once was, is locked away in a coffin. The mirror of the pond holding her image up to her turns into a metal lid - "In the night air / the surface of the pond is metal" ("The Pond", HM, p. 12). The archetypal imagery of the female - trees, the sea, night, the moon, the vessel, and inner space - has lost its traditional connotations. The sea is generally inimical and destructive ("The Egg", F, p. 4; "Cottonmouth Country", F, p. 41; "Inlet", F, p. 52; "Archipelago", HM, p. 15). Only in the poems "The Undertaking" (HM, p. 00) and "The Swim- mer" (HM, p. 45) do self-extinction and an oceanic feeling of expansion con- verge. The moon, too, is sinister and distant rather than a familiar symbol of her own sexuality. "The toothed moon" of "All Hallows" (HM, p. 11) and the "ringed moon" of "The Pond" (HM, p. 12) echo Sylvia Plath's moon "staring from her hood of bones"16. In "Messengers" the moon-rise is described in almost apocalyptic images, destructive and revelatory like "the red / eye, the cauldron of morning" sun in "Ariel"17. The inner space has not completely lost its traditional connota- tion but it is either as claustrophobic as the other prisons and compartments the persona inhabits or it empties itself out: 16 Sylvia Plath, "Edge", Ariel (New York, 1961), p. 84. 17 I bd. p. 27.</page><page sequence="13">Women in Transition 1 43 I heard my ¡nsides roll into a crib It's dark. It's dark. He's brought a bowl to catch the pieces of the baby ("The Egg", F, p. 4-5) Emptiness and loneliness are the most frequently recurring moods. There is no wholeness, rarely fulfillment in human relationships. Glück's strength lies in the creation of evocative scenes condensed into almost mythic images: The woman holding out her empty hand in the archetypal gesture of the beggar ("All Hallows", HM, p. 11); "Gretei in Darkness" (HM, p. 13), the innocent girl of the fairy-tale, whom Glück has transformed into an Electra-figure, a deserted woman whose sacrifice has been in vain; she, too, is left empty-handed. Darkness, ice, and snow are the recurrent metaphors of loneliness: and I heard my name not spoken but cried out so that I reached for you except the sheet was ice ("1 2.6.1 971", HM, p. 38) The poem "Early December on Croton-on-Hudson" (F, p. 13), after unfolding an uninhabitable landscape of frost, ice, and stasis, bursts out in unexpected ur- gency: "I want you" - this is as close as Glück ever comes to a declaration of love. The mother-daughter relationship, so tortured and ambivalent in Sexton's work, is usually demonic and violent in Glück's poetry. It is compulsive and devoid of freedom. The mother turns into a vampire, a catastrophe ("My Life Before Dawn", F, p. 24; "Pomegranate", HM, p. 33). Yet the childhood memory of the mother ("For My Mother", HM, p. 34) also yields one of Glück's most beautiful and serene poems that through its metaphorical use of nature imagery creates an almost mythical atmosphere. In a landscape that is always at the point of emptying itself into nothingness, of freezing into stasis or into an uninhabitable world of ice, the persona is equally threatened. As the existence of reality and of the self becomes precarious, language becomes hermetic, images tend to become private chiffres of an inner reality severed from common experience. Glück creates a closed universe where objective reality and her dream-world coalesce, often a world out of time and space, a mythic world, a huge projection of an inner world. In a vicious circle this world assaults the persona whose deep image it is. In her striving for a hidden meaning for which the tangible phenomena are ominous chiffres, language too becomes contingent, a mere, often imprecise approximation. "Words fail me" she says in "The Inlet" (f, p. 52): "I know what's slipping through my fingers [ . . . ] but this riddle has no name". The world disintegrates and so do the words and images that should hold it in its place. Yet in the midst of a fragmented hostile world the persona survives by an unexpected turn at the end of the poem, having gone through and come out by a miracle, purified: "Scalps dissolve in the obliterating light / and only I, Shadrach, come back alive and well". Glück's stance, gloomy and death- ridden though it is, is that of a fighter, of a last-minute-survivor. However, failure and despair are as frequent as survival. Often the persona goes under with the</page><page sequence="14">1 44 Waltraud Mitgutsch disintegrating world, losing consciousness and articulation. In "Archipelago" (HM, p. 15), a sinister poem that denies the reader any point of reference in the objective world, the Odyssey on which the persona embarks ends in despair and madness: water sneers against our ship, our shrunk number runs in two packs: madness and suicide. The twelfth year the captain calls his name, it has no meaning, and the crew shrieks in its extremity. (HM, p. 15) In the engulf ment of an overpowering, hostile reality, meaning is lost, language becomes obsolete, consciousness is extinguished. Sexton's poetry, too, oscillates between salvation and annihilation. The world she creates may be more familiar to common experience, her language less her- metic, but her poetic landscape is also a mirror of her inner world projected onto the external environment. To her, imagery is the hallmark of poetry: "Images are the heart of poetry. Images come from the unconscious. Imagination and the unconscious are one and the same. You are not a poet without imagery."18 There- fore her poetry is often located in a realm in which dream-fragments and tangible reality are fused. Concrete objects become chiffres of the unconscious and are subject to a rigorous principle of selection. Thus her preoccupation with death manifests itself in a landscape of reification, fragmentation, and reduction. The self, from whom this imagery originates, in her turn falls prey to the externalized forces of death. One of the most compelling poems that subjects everything - the world, the persona, language - to the overwhelming power of death is "The Si- lence" (Folly, p. 32-33). By eliminating all colors and sounds, she opens up a sinister realm of death, as surreal and ghostlike as a landscape by de Chirico: My room is whitewashed, as white as a rural station house and just as silent; whiter than chicken bones bleached in the moonlight, pure garbage and just as silent. The self, like Plath's persona in "Elm" (Ariel, p. 15) is reduced to a charred object by the white fire of death. And finally words, too, are turned into ugly objects, "words leak out like a miscarriage". Language fails her, poetic utterance becomes a still-birth, creation is impossible in the grip of the all-pervasive death that remains at the end as a vulture eating the persona alive: Yet there is a silence. Always silence. Like an enormous mouth. The silence is death. It comes each day with its shock 18 Anne Sexton, Interview. In: William Packard (ed.) The Craft of Poetry.

Paradoxical- ly, death is the only living existence feeding greedily on the persona, whereas everything else falls away into silence and non-existence. However, death and all its metaphorical projections on the persona are not an end in itself. Like Glück she has to struggle through uninhabitable models of reality, through discarded selves, and a language not fit to express her experience, in order to come up with a new self. Often they both feel imprisoned and suffo- cated in the ossified husks of traditional world-views. The shape of the new self is vague and many ways toward rebirth have become unviable because they have been used in the name of a repressive society, Sexton sees one way to wholeness in the religious mysticism of her later volumes. However, it is not a mysticism of self-transcendence. Rebirth is acted out in physical metaphors. Her body, her female sexuality becomes the catalyst of all experience. Thus her poems are some- times tortured and sometimes exstatic variations on female self-definition. The anger in Glück's confrontation with the world is that of a younger generation refusing to compromise and to be placated, burning as if it could go on burning itself, burning down feeding on everything till there is nothing in life that has not fed that fire.1' But she, too hopes for the moment when ''the soul creeps out of the tree" ("All Hallows", HM, p. 11).
