<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Robe Fit for a Chief DOMINIQUE MALAQUAIS In displays of wealth and power, excess most often is the name of the game. More is better; more still is better yet. Consider Versailles or Versace. Consider the vestments of Bamileke chiefs (fig. i).' FIRST WORDS The Bamileke are a people of Cameroon, a nation on the border between West and Central Africa. For some three centuries they have made their home in the country's west- ern grasslands, a vast region of plateaus and peaks so green and cool that French colonizers dubbed it l'Auvergne de l'Afrique, in a reference to the hilly, verdant region of cen- tral France. Here, highly centralized polities flourish: chief- taincies overseen by rulers known as mfo (sing., fo), men whose power over land and people plays a significant role in the political life of contemporary Cameroon. The great majority of Bamileke chieftaincies (sing., gung, pl., mgung) were founded in the eighteenth century. In all, the region includes I02 such polities-communities ranging from 200 to well over i00,000 inhabitants. The most pow- erful mgung-Bandjoun, Bana, Bangangte, Bazou, and Bansoa-have long been a subject of considerable interest among students of African sculpture. Elaborate beaded and shell-embroidered thrones (fig. 2), massive wood stools (fig. 3), gargantuan carved heads (fig. 4), and many masks of var- ious kinds have for decades made their way into public and private collections in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Not all Bamileke art, however, draws such attention. Whereas objects of wood, metal (primarily brass), and on occasion terracotta are highly sought after by amateurs of grasslands art, soft materials-beaded, embroidered, or dyed cloth-receive significantly less attention. The same is true of works created elsewhere in West Africa. The stunning mud-dyed bokolanfini cloths created by Bamana women of Mali are of far less interest to collectors than the tyiwara headdresses carved by Bamana men (see fig. I2); collections of Senufo art from northern Cote d'Ivoire are far more like- ly to contain kagba helmet masks (fig. 5) than examples of the arresting black-on-white images painted on cotton by weavers in the village of Waraniene (fig. 6). Such prefer- ences for the hard over the soft, however, are not a constant in the realm of African connoisseurship. Some specialists of Nigerian artistry give equal weight to the colossal textile centerpieces of the Oyo region's egungun festivals (fig. 7), as they do to the widely known epa masks carved by sculptors of the Yoruba northeast (fig. 8). The so-called kente cloths of Ashanti monarchs and the raffia pile musese cloths of Kuba kings (fig. 9) have been the subject of countless articles, monographs, and, most recently, knock-offs by the fashion industry. (In i998, Hermes models sported Ashanti- and Kuba-inspired foulards, Bloomingdale's touted musese-style place settings, and on the streets of New York kente caps and bags were all the rage.) r.

Why so little scholarly interest has been focused on the soft creations of Bamileke artists is unclear. From an aes- thetic and conceptual point of view, from the standpoint of variety, and in terms of craftsmanship and sheer originality a tremendous range of forms is extant for study. The over- whelming preference shown by private collectors and museums for hard works, however, has hampered such study. Relatively few soft pieces are available for scrutiny in I9</page><page sequence="5">Figure 8. Bangboye of Odo-Owa, Nigerian, died I978: epa helmet mask, Yoruba peoples, 1920-30.

The African arts collection at The Art Museum, Princeton University, offers a welcome respite from this general state of affairs. Not only does it include an imposing example of soft art produced by a Bamileke craftsman but this work, contrary to common practice, is given pride of place in the collection's permanent display. The piece in question-the subject of this essay-is a massive feathered vestment, a knee-length tunic whose every inch is covered in flowing, chocolate-colored, russet, and ocher feathers (fig. i). It was probably made in the i950s. Although it seems certain that it was crafted for use by Bamileke clients, in all likelihood it was never worn. The 20</page><page sequence="6">~~~~~~~~~~A.

Many works of art created during this period left the country before they could be put to their intended use, sold for a pittance by men and women seeking funds to leave the highlands for cities to the south, or merely to survive. Tunics such as the Museum's were (and, in many chieftaincies still are) worn by dancers in ceremonies hosted by mkem (sing., kem), men's initiation associations whose members entertain close links with the chief. Commonly they are worn with helmet masks, carv- ings depicting persons or animals (typically horned crea- tures). Unlike a true mask, a helmet mask is placed on the forehead, its visage tilted skyward. The dancer's features are hidden not by the mask itself but by lengths of cloth wrapped around his face. Slits in the cloth allow him to see, but not to be seen or recognized by others (figs. io, i i). While the use of tunics such as the one in The Art Museum is well documented, little has been written about the meanings associated with vestments of this kind.

The things people wear, from priests' habits to lawyers' business suits, are fraught with meaning, with history, symbols, and allu- sions, some (or even many) of which may escape the wear- er's attention. Different wearers, moreover, may have different perceptions of the same costume; when, where, and why the costume is worn can make all the difference. Add to this the varied viewpoints of onlookers: Ms. Klensch herself live at Victoria's Secret's cyber-lingerie show, an event visited by millions on the Worldwide Web; a teenage boy logging on from Iowa to witness the event from his lap- top; picketers commenting on the event (in person, in Internet chat rooms); a Nigerian anthropologist writing an article on the subject for a scholarly journal.... Multiple layers accumulate, one weaving into, contradicting, enhancing, and enriching the next. Such are the wealth and complexity of meanings that attach to a single costume. My intention in this essay is not to unravel all or even most of the meanings inherent in The Art Museum's Bamileke tunic. Such an attempt would be foolhardy. My goal, rather, is to explore a cluster of possible meanings: an assemblage of ways in which one might consider looking at the vestment in question. In so doing, I propose to focus on one principal theme, a concern I have encountered again and again in my work in the Bamileke region: the notion of excess. 22</page><page sequence="8">ON THE NA TURE OF EXCESS: DEFINITIONS Excess is in the eye of the beholder. For some, too much is never enough; consider (yet again) Versailles: mirrors re- flecting ad infinitum the gilt of golden frames. For others, there is no such thing as too little: less, by definition, is best. For artists in many societies south of the Sahara, perfection historically has resided in finding a balance between too much and too little, a middle ground from which excess and minimalism both have been banished, opening up a space where forms flourish that are at once pure and whimsical, simple and evocative. Seeking simplicity. Such forms are the domain of Bamana statuary. Tyiwara antelope figures (seen, for example, on the headdresses in fig. I2), are a hallmark of Bamana carving. They read, it has been said, like hieroglyphs-pure calli- graphic form.2 So it is with the finest examples of the genre. Like hieroglyphs, they attain the perfection of utter simplic- ity. All extraneous details have been set aside by the sculp- tor. Only the animal's head and horns, its mane and trunk are shown, carved with the precision of a line etched in ink. A form has been created that is eminently legible, clear, and concise. The quest for formal purity that one senses in such works is characteristic of Bamana art in general. It expresses an important aesthetic tenet: the concept ofjayan. To be suc- cessful by Bamana standards, a work of art must be clear, concise, pared down to the essentials: it must possess jayan. Central to the concept ofjayan is a single, all-important term: woron. This word is employed many ways; it is used to speak of sculpture, pottery, and weaving, dance, music, and epic storytelling. Woron means "to shuck," "to husk," "to get to the kernel." Our term "kernel" in this context translates as kolo: "nut," "bone," "core," and by extension "nucleus," essential structure." Great artists, Bamana critics say, are those who cut to the essence of things. At the opposite end of the spectrum are those whose work is awash in masiri (accumulation)-extraneous details that hinder a reading of the object as pure form.3 In Search of Balance. Many Yoruba critics think in similar terms. Mass and features both-in a figure, a mask, a con- tainer-must be completely legible. Clarity of form and line are key. A specialized vocabulary is employed here, too: ifarabon (visibility); la (the process of outlining with preci- sion a figure's facial characteristics); le and ge (rendering ornaments in crisp detail); fin (incising with a razor blade's accuracy aspects of hair ornamentation and scarification). Symmetry and balance are considered essential as well. An object should be neither too static nor too suggestive of movement. Its surface should be smooth but not so polished as to interfere with its legibility. Most important, if it depicts a person, it should embody a quality Robert Farris Thompson has defined as "midpoint mimesis": it should resemble, or recall, rather than replicate. Neither hyperrealism nor over- generalization will do; aesthetic success lies in striking a per- fect balance between naturalism and abstraction. Good art does not illustrate; it evokes, thereby touching on truths that mere representation cannot aspire to express.4 Horror Vacui. Analogous views are held by Bamileke sculptors, but up to a certain point only. Objects created for the courts of Bamileke chiefs must be crafted with grace. Here, as among the Bamana and Yoruba, elegance is key. Forms must be rendered with clarity; smoothness and sheen are prized. The work of one of Bandjoun's most renowned carvers, still active today though he is well into his seventies, underscores this observation. Paul Tahbou (known also as Tekomye, the name by which he is addressed in ceremoni- al settings) is responsible for many a seat and throne stored in the palace and treasury of the Bandjoun chief His work is admired for the crisp handling of its lines and the fine use he makes of beading to accentuate a figure's principal features. But there is more. In his work, one encounters an element that seems characteristic of much Bamileke art: a distinct horror vacui. Beads, incised and painted striations, geomet- ric designs drawn from textile ornamentation, and row after row of figures form an ongoing rhythm of staccato patterns: an approach to surface ornamentation that leaves few naked planes, few unadorned spaces for the viewer's eye to find respite (fig. I3). Much the same is true of work by one of the Bamileke region's most famous sculptors, Kwam. Kwam was the official carver of Fo Max Kamwa, ruler of Baham, Bandjoun's neighbor and rival, from I928 to I954. Kwam is best known for a monument he created in honor of Kamwa: a towering multifigure construction covered by the 23</page><page sequence="9">Figure I4.

Caryatids, some human, some animal, hold aloft a stool on which are seated three figures: thefo himself and two queens. Kamwa sports a feathered headdress, countless necklaces and bracelets, and an exquisite skirt, all decorated with brilliantly colored geometric designs. The chief's arms, belly, and legs are covered in a fantastic array of colored patterns as well. As for the queens, from beaded scarification patterns to cowrie-encrusted coiffures, not an 24</page><page sequence="10">I 1I- f, ti1W X 1~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0 I-I .T~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Lv~~~~~~~i Figure i 5.

Kwam is known, too, for a series of exquisite portals he produced for buildings on the Baham chiefs estate: rich figural compositions in which rows of men, women, and animals carved in high relief compete for the viewer's attention, one jostling another in a riot of form, movement, and design (fig. I 5). In making these works, Kwam's mentor was an artist for whom the very notion of empty space seems to have been anathema- a man known to posterity only as the Bati Master. In the early years of the century, Max Kamwa's father, Fo Pokam, commissioned several pieces from this Master. Among them were two portals so rich in pattern and composition that their constituent figures seem ever on the verge of an'. A ds - Figure i6. Fo Pokam, Baham chieftaincy, Cameroon, seated before a portal carved by the Bati Master. Photographic archives of the Mus~e de l'Homme, Pads. stepping away from the posts they grace (fig. i6). To garner as rich a sense as possible of the horror vacui that typifies Bamileke art, one must step back. One must look at buildings or displays of objects (regalia clustered around a chiefly throne, for instance) in their entirety, as an ensemble. Only then does the full impact of this approach to space and form become evident. One edifice in particular underscores this point: a tower- ing structure thirty meters high, made of red earth, raffia palm, thatch, and wood. Located at the heart of Bandjoun, in the tsa (or compound of chiefs), it is known as the bung die, or "house of the people." First erected in I927, it has since been rebuilt three times, twice following fires caused 25</page><page sequence="11">by ill-attended hearths, once (the last, in i959) after it was burned to the ground by arsonists. Now as in previous incarnations, each and every inch of this massive structure's facade is covered in ornamental detail (fig. I7). The palm stalks that sheathe its outer walls are attached to one anoth- er by an artful crisscross of raffia ties, a checkerboard that covers the entire facade. In multiple places this is overlain with painted designs: geometric patterns derived from tex- tile ornamentation; curvilinear forms patterned on scarification marks; abstract motifs recalling thefo's animal familiars (crocodiles and leopards, buffaloes and pythons); zoomorphic motifs associated with chiefly attributes (wis- dom, represented by the tortoise, fertility, embodied in the toad). In strategic locations-among these, a miniature house attached to the building's facade, where the chief sits during important ceremonies-the walls have been covered with veritable exercises in cloisonne. Here, interlocking strips of raffia have been placed one on top of another, form- ing a multicolored mosaic wonderfully pleasing to the eye and touch. Elaborate carvings add yet another layer to the building's wealth of visual and tactile stimuli. Its portals are adorned with an array of figures sculpted in medium and high relief. Pillars encircle the outer walls, their every inch covered in carved designs. Above, where each pillar meets the massive thatch roof, still more designs appear. All are geometric, some painted on raffia or wood, others woven from the soft casing of young raffia plants. In this spectacular edifice, hor- ror vacui Bamileke-style finds one of its most exalted expressions. But let us not dwell on hard works alone. The attention to detail and the focus on every inch of an object's surface encountered in the carvings and structure described above are found also in the soft arts of textile and costume design. Indeed, they may be seen to attain their perfection in this setting-for here an element of movement is added, which renders yet more rich the works produced and still more complex the horror vacui they express. Witnessed in the context of a dance, a vestment like The Art Museum's tunic is a sight to behold. As the masker moves, spinning and sprinting about the performance arena, the feathers that cover his tunic rise as puffs of air lift them up and out. As he gains greater and greater momentum, his shoulders and torso increase in size. At the height of the dance, he appears immense, akin to a magnificent bird. Then, suddenly, he stops. A second ago he was hirsute; now, as his ruff settles, he appears as he did initially: sheathed in a seamless cloak of flowing feathers. The sheer wealth of movement, texture, and form gener- ated as the dancer paces through the arena is the result of countless hours of work. Like the cloisonne details on the bung die facade and the beaded surfaces of Kwam's works, feather tunics like The Art Museum's require a remarkable attention to detail. Underlying the downy layer that covers the coat is tightly woven cloth. (In later examples, like the Museum's tunic, the underlying cloth is a machine-made nylon weave. In earlier feather vestments the undercloth is made of tightly woven hemp, jute, or, occasionally, cotton.) Each of the hundreds of feathers that grace the garment must be inserted into the undercloth, firmly enough to ensure that they will remain in place while the masker dances, yet deli- cately too, in a manner that takes into account his comfort and the ease of movement he requires. Between perfor- mances, great care must be lavished on the garment. Feathers must be acquired and inserted to replace ones lost in the heat of action. The surface must be regularly smoothed, lest it lose its sheen. Insects must be kept at bay. Only with such atten- tion will every inch of the undercloth remain concealed, blanketed in layer upon layer of lustrous plumes. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF EXCESS The horror vacui so characteristic of Bamileke art is no mere aesthetic preference. In Kwam's beaded monument to Fo Max Kamwa, in the facade of the bung die, in the feathered garments of maskers, a specific goal is sought. The artist's intent, be he beader or builder, weaver or dancer, is to cre- ate a sense of extraordinary profusion. The Power of Profusion. Works of art in the Bamileke region-carved figures and stools; masks sculpted in wood or crafted in soft materials; garments made of indigo-dyed cotton, beaded jute, or feather-inlayed cloth; and buildings enriched with raffia-palm ties and painted designs-belong to chiefs and notables. Ordinary citizens (farmers, traders, increasing numbers of unemployed women and men) do not possess such things. Those who do-high-ranking men 26</page><page sequence="12">41 -} I .*fj2: 1 |~~~~~~~~~~~~ Ue Figure 17.

At the center are a beaded stool and ceremonial gourd with a stopper in the shape of a bird. and, occasionally, female relatives of the chief-have the authorization of the tsa. That this is so is underscored by the contexts in which such works appear and by symbols incor- porated in them. Always, references to the Jo take center stage. A nobleman may build a shang, or meetinghouse a structure akin to the bung die, though on a distinctly more modest scale-only by permission of the tsa; historically, this has been the case and it remains true today, even as other rules imposed by the chiefly elite have begun to fall away. Within his shang, a nobleman may display carved stools, symbols of exalted rank. If he wishes to maintain good rela- tions with thefo, however, he will obey rules dictating what manner of images may appear on both the facade of his shang and the rungs of his stools. He may dance in public wrapped in precious cloths or organize masquerade performances in his compound. But, once again, if ties with thefo are impor- tant to him, he will do so only after seeking the tsa's approval. What kinds of symbols may be displayed and by whom is carefully codified. Rules governing the ornamentation of doors and facades exemplify this. Untitled men are forbid- den to adorn the exterior of their homes with carved designs of any sort. Notables of a certain rank-men whose com- pounds boast a shang-may incorporate some architectural ornamentation into the design of their homesteads. All images of human beings, however, and most renditions of 27</page><page sequence="13">- .K Figure I8. Kungan maskers. Niat compound, Bangangte chieftaincy, Cameroon. animals, lie beyond their grasp. What they may display is abstract imagery: geometric designs that, in contrast to figural images seen at the court, are incised (or on occasion painted) rather than rendered in relief or in the round. Similar rules obtain where the decoration of stools and the possession of masks are concerned. As the foregoing suggests, anthropomorphic and (to a somewhat lesser extent) zoomorphic imagery are the exclu- sive privilege of chiefs. This is so for reasons intimately linked to the origins of thefo's power. Chiefly might, in the Bamileke enclave, hinges on one seminal consideration: the fo's ability to foster life. In the eyes of their subjects, Bamileke chiefs are life itself If flowers bloom, plants grow, and root crops mature, it is in large part as a result of thefo's grace. So, too, it is thanks to him that human and animal life thrive. "The chief," Bernard Maillard wrote of Bandjoun in the early i980s, "renders fecund all that lies within his domain.", The power that he wields over images of living beings is understood by all to express this essential facet of his identity. Images alone, however, cannot thoroughly convey this aspect of the Jo's persona. One, two, ten, or even twenty figures, be they human or animal, can allude to his identity as a source of life, but they cannot fully express it. Essential to such an expression are dozens and dozens of figures. Here, quantity--sheer profusion-is key. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the architecture of the Bandjoun tsa. Figures of men, women, and children, disembodied heads, hands, eyes, and mouths abound; turtles and toads, croco- diles, leopards, lions, and pythons are everywhere on lin- tels, jambs, and doorsteps, on pillars and angle posts, on walls, ceilings, and eaves, in numbers so great that, wherev- er one stands, one has the sensation of being in the midst of a crowd. Ngnie Kamga, ruler of Bandjoun since i984, points out that the tsa is meant to be crowded not only by figures carved, painted, and incised but also by living, breathing human beings whom he can summon at will. At times, he notes, the compound may seem empty; but one should not be fooled. It is, in fact, home to vast numbers of people men, women, and children whom he can call forth with a mere gesture or cry, causing the estate's main path to be flooded with bodies in a matter of seconds.6 On certain cer- emonial occasions, so many people appear that the tsa seems literally awash in humanity, a remarkable sight that colonial administrators noted with awe.7 The profusion of images and people one encounters at the tsa and the link between this and thefo's identity as a source of life shed direct light on the horror vacui that is central to Bamileke artistic production. Kwam's monument to Max Kamwa, the facade of the bung die, and The Art Museum's feather vestment are, like the tsa on ceremonial occasions, exercises in profusion, reminders of the extraordinary power Bamnileke mfo wield over the fecundity of their world. The foregoing is underscored by rules governing processes of orna- 28</page><page sequence="14">mentation. Certain types of images and designs, as we have seen, are restricted. Restricted also is the use of certain mate- rials or, more properly, the amount used. Persons of any sta- tus may possess objects adorned with beads. Objects covered in beads, however, have historically been the sole prerogative of the ruling elite. Much the same is true of pieces covered with cowrie shells (mbum). While notables of a certain rank are enti- tled to display carvings or textiles adorned with a small num- ber of mbum, only chiefs, it is said, may own works sheathed in cowries. This is so because cowries are symbols of fertility.8 The masks of Kungan, an association whose rites focus on matters of fecundity,9 are covered in mbum (fig. i 8). Danced in honor of the chief, they celebrate his role as the father of all life. Beads, too, particularly in large numbers, are associated with fertility. This is the case in one context specifically: ntu', long-necked gourds wrapped in brilliant sheaths of glass beads and cowries, placed at regular intervals along the tsa's main path on ritual occasions. Ntu' commemorate the chief's ances- tors, from whom, it is said, he draws his power over life.-o Among the Bamileke as in many cultures, birds and, by exten- sion, feathers are associated with the ancestors and thereby with renewal. Stoppers carved in the form of birds common- ly crown ntu' gourds, underscoring this link (fig. I7). Conspicuous Consumption. Implicit in the practice of sheathing objects in shells, beads, and feathers is a strong ele- ment of conspicuous consumption. Cowries and beads are luxury goods. Both are imported-cowries from the Indian Ocean, beads from Europe. Early examples of the latter like- ly came from Venice; thereafter, the principal source was Czechoslovakia. In the Bamileke highlands such a premium was placed on beads that in the nineteenth century they were traded over vast distances in networks linking chief- taincies hundreds of miles apart. To obtain beads from European merchants, chiefs exchanged goods highly valued by Africans and Europeans alike-including ivory and slaves." Cowries were considered so precious that, in the i 8oos, prior to the arrival of colonial forces in the region, they were used as currency; to sheathe an object in mbum was quite literally to cover it in money. Today, beads and cowries remain expensive items, beyond the reach of most Bamileke. Under the circumstances, commissioning and displaying objects like ntu' gourds or Kungan masks (to say nothing of Kwam's towering bead and cowrie celebration # 'A ox ~~~"nel - NMI9. 1ilI l Figure i9.

There is also a clear element of conspicuous consumption in works like The Art Museum's feather tunic. Here, the focus is on labor and rarity, on the difficulty and the time involved in acquiring certain types of feathers. Bamileke craftsmen produce a wide range of feather gar- ments for use in ceremonial contexts. Among these are 29</page><page sequence="15">4r- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Figure 20.

The latter range from elegant skullcaps to disklike hats that crown the head in a halo of crimson-colored feathers (tse nteng) and plume- bedecked caryatid constructions several feet in diameter (masah). Masah are worn exclusively by chiefs. Other forms of feathered apparel grace the heads and bodies of notables designated by thefo. They are worn in honor or service of the ruler and accordingly, in most chieftaincies, are consid- ered to belong to him, whether or not they are actually kept in his compound (figs. 20, 21). When speaking of plumed vestments and headdresses stored in the fo's treasury in Bandjoun, chiefly retainers dwell at length on the sheer quantity of feathers required to produce such ceremonial garments, and they emphasize the tremendous amount of time it can require to assemble them. Ladislas Taffe Mogue, a carver at the court of Ngnie Kamga, focuses on the scarcity of certain types of feathers. Some hats and cloaks, he notes, are made from the plumage of a bird that is not only rare but also remarkable in that it has only two tail feathers. Once a year the bird molts; only then can its precious feathers be gathered.I2 Tse nteng disks are com- monly adorned with feathers of the local vermilion parrot (Psittacus erythraceus). Once abundant in the region, this bird is now nearing extinction, as is the great touraco (Coruthaeola cristata), whose feathers adorn chiefly masah headdresses. " Artists and retainers speak also of the importance attached to color in the manufacture of feather garments. Colors associated with wealth and power are particularly appreciat- ed, highlighting yet again the role that conspicuous display plays in the commissioning, making, and wearing of these elaborate creations. Long before it arrived on the endan- gered species list, the vermilion parrot was prized for its bril- liant hue. The color red (pehpe) is generally associated with things rare and sacred. Intimately linked to concepts of life and renewal, it is the color of chiefly power: "Upon his ini- tiation and, following this, when he is enthroned Jean- Pierre Notue writes], the newfo is adorned with peh, a paste of powdered mahogany and palm oil that tints his skin red, symbolizing his power and ... the rebirth within him of the chieftaincy's founding fathers."'4 The clothes worn by the incumbent and the ritual objects surrounding him on these occasions are red as well-either tinted with peh or made of red materials (copper, red beads, red cloth, and, of course, red feathers). This array of crim- son hues and the rebirth it symbolizes are compared to "the sun as it sets and then blazes anew the following day."'I Ideas of wealth, fertility, and chiefly might attach also to the rich brown hues seen in The Art Museum's tunic. Browns, oranges, and ochers are associated, Notue writes, with the earth-an important symbol of fertility-and with key aspects of political power. Thefo's two principal ministers, he observes-the wala ka and wala sissi (his foreign minister and minister of the interior)-appear in public sheathed in deep chocolate brown cloaks. Similar vestments-typically, a long brown cloak crowned with a thick spray of feathers- are worn by prominent members of Nye, an association whose members play a central role in Ke, an elaborate series of religious, musical, and masquerade performances held during a nine-week period every two years to celebrate and renew thefro's identity as a source of life.'6 The manifold allusions to might, riches, and fecund growth in works like The Art Museum's tunic come to life most vividly when the garments are worn. In masquerade performances, dancers sporting feather tunics are often given pride of place. In certain Bamileke chieftaincies, as in the culturally related polities of the Bamoum and Bamenda regions to the east and northwest, maskers thus attired act as an advance guard. They announce the arrival of other maskers, often with violent movements, the swing of a stick and guttural cries, clearing the path and emptying the envi- rons of unwanted onlookers. Their plumed habits identify them as messengers of the fo.'7 Followed, typically, by dozens of other maskers-whose sheer numbers point to the extraordinary sway the chief holds over life in the gung- their bodies awhirl in sprays of feathers symbolizing wealth, force, and renewal, these plumed messengers burst forth in a display of riches and might so conspicuous it takes the breath away. THE ART OF EXCESS Several hours spent in the thick of a masquerade perfor- mance on a chiefly compound's dance arena can leave onlookers exhausted, European and Bamileke alike.

Expressions of life. That excess is the goal sought is indu- bitable. In conversations with all manner of persons, from acquaintances met in a marketplace or in a bar to members of a chief s retinue and the fo himself, it is made eminently clear: excess is a fundamental aspect of the ruler's public per- sona. All things larger or more imposing than the norm- all things suggesting an element of excess-are by definition Figure 23. Gourd adorned with the jawbones of vanquished enemies.

A farmer who finds in his field an unusually large melon, an oversized cassava root, or a particularly heavy kola nut is expected to bring it to the tsa. Multiple births are immedi- ately announced to the chief Bundles of wood are deposit- ed at the gates of his compound to sanctify the occasion and to underscore a key point: twins, abundance incarnate, belong to the chief; he is their de facto father. All trees taller than the norm, baobabs first and foremost, are his (a fact made clear by the name that baobabs are given in Bandjoun: 32</page><page sequence="18">fo'am), and cutting one down without express approval from the tsa is tantamount to treason. Today, few wild animals roam the highlands. At the turn of the century, however, herds of elephants and buffaloes, hippopotamus, leopards, and other great beasts were common. A hunter who bagged such a creature and failed to bring it to the tsa put himself in grave danger. Such creatures were the chiefs and chiefs alone. Indeed, he was thought to be one of them. It was (and is still) said that afo can at will transform himself into one of the great beasts. In this form, like the animal whose shape he takes on, the chief is known as nomtema, "exalted one who cannot be felled." Unlike other creatures, howev- er, he never travels alone; in a demonstration of conspicu- ous force a display, once again, of sheer numbers-he always appears with an animal retinue, as the leader of a pack. In certain ceremonial contexts (during important Ke dances, for instance), his identity as nomtema is brought graphically to the fore: as he moves across the performance arena, he is followed by a long line of dancers, each of whom wears a leopard pelt on his back. Expressions of death. Profusion and excess in the chiefly arts, we have seen, are intimately linked to the chiefs iden- tity as a source of life and renewal. But there is more. Both are associated also with death. Just as he can give life, thefo can take it away. At the tips of his fingers, it is said, he holds terrible curses. On a whim, he can access forms of sorcery others can only imagine. Simply put, he is a remarkably dan- gerous man. This dark facet of the ruler's identity finds one of its most compelling expressions in the arts. The treasuries of chiefs throughout the region contain works illustrating in no uncertain terms their owner's ability to impose death on those whom he considers his enemies. These include bead- covered crania (atwonzen)-decapitated heads brought back as trophies by warriors in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, adorned by master beaders for display at the court (fig. 22); 8 calabashes from whose necks hang the jawbones of felled enemies, a genre imported from Foumban, capital of the Bamoum sultanate, in the i 800s (fig. 23); and stat- uettes that show a figure with a hugely distended belly that appears to contain not twins, nor even triplets, but whole hordes of beings waiting to be born. The latter images are of fertility, yes, but also graphic representations of the painful death a chief can inflict on those who would break f .: .. -:-.. - 4 Figure 24.

This sense of excess gone awry is absent from most works seen in ceremonies open to the public, such as beaded cal- abashes, cowrie-encrusted thrones, and plumed vestments and hats-absent, but not altogether banished. It is there, as it were, sotto voce-a reminder that the chief is a complex man, one whose control over the life of his people can prove to be a double-edged sword. Feather tunics and cloaks, in 33</page><page sequence="19">! ~ ~ - E W.7 Figure 25. Mandjong dancers. Compound of Mukam Dengji Fogue, Famwa quarter, Bandjoun chieftaincy, Cameroon. particular, underscore this point. Symbolically and visually they contain references to the danger inherent in the fo's person and power. Feathers are associated with life and renewal, but they also are tied to aggression and death. Particularly significant in this regard is their connection with warfare. In the past, when interchieftaincy combat was common, mfo had large armies at their disposal. From a young age, boys were trained in the arts of war, in most cases in an association called Mandjong. Each quarter or territorial subdivision within a given chieftaincy boasted a Mandjong chapter, overseen by a high-ranking ally of the chief. Warriors strid- ing into battle wore towering feather hats called ft ngou, made from the plumage of the touraco bird (Tauraco leucolo- phus). Over a foot tall, elaborately layered, and colored a deep purple-kto, the color of victory-these hats gave the warriors a fearsome appearance Today, interchieftaincy warfare is a thing of the past; Mandjong, however, lives on in the form of a public-works organization administered by representatives of the tsa. (Members build bridges, repair roads, and clear paths and plazas prior to ceremonies orga- nized by the chief.) At the funerals of high-ranking men, large groups of Mandjong dancers are a common sight. Some still appear crowned with feather caps (purple, as before, but because the touraco is becoming increasingly scarce, they are made from the tinted feathers of more ordi- nary birds).20 Many members wear tunics to which an array of heterogeneous materials have been attached: flowing 34</page><page sequence="20">Figure 26. Tunic. Grasslands region, Cameroon, ca. 1950. Mixed media; h. 83.0 cm., w. 65.0 cm.

In the past, men who had returned from war bearing the crania of enemies pro- claimed their feat by appearing in public wearing a single red parrot feather stuck in their cap. Famous hunters who had felled a nomtema for the chief did the same. Presented by one chief to another, a single red feather constituted a declara- tion of war: the ultimate act of aggression.21 Not only the materials of which they are made but also the manner in which these are assembled gives works like The Art Museum's tunic an aura of danger-a hint of the dark side. Horror vacui, we have seen, is brought here to its climax: not a single millimeter of the vestment's underlying cloth is visible. Every single surface is saturated, choked with feathers. While it is appreciated on aesthetic and symbolic grounds, such surfeit also causes some uneasiness among Bamileke viewers. Excess, accretion, layering, surfaces thick with superimposed material are associated with life and renewal but also, in certain contexts, with danger: with supernatural powers, unexplained phenomena, sorcery, and, by extension, death.22 One piece in particular, now in a European private col- lection, underscores this observation (fig.26). The work in question, like the piece that is the subject of the present essay, is a tunic. Attached to its undercloth-a colonial uni- form shirt (whether German or French is unclear)-cover- ing every available inch of cloth, is a mind-boggling array of objects. Simian crania and claws jostle the husks of dried nuts, feathers, porcupine quills, bones, gourds of various shapes, and a stunning cluster of pangolin scales. Disembodied animal jaws compete for space with horns, sundry pieces of metal, leather, strips of cloth, and snake- skin. A group of objects most likely drawn from European costumes adds to the tunic's extravagant layering: a croco- dile-skin wallet, buttons, and zippers. In many ways, the object defies description. To whom it belonged and exact- ly how it was used are unclear. An undated photograph reproduced as a postcard shows it being worn, suggesting that it was meant to appear in contexts similar to those in which The Art Museum's tunic was seen.23 Given Bamileke views of accretion and surface layering, it seems safe to say that this remarkable piece-whatever its exact use-was perceived as an object of considerable power. The presence within it of components such as feath- ers, skulls, and jawbones suggests that it was connected both to ideas of life and renewal and to darker concepts. In par- ticular, two diminutive glass vials filled with a murky, unidentified liquid are strongly suggestive of powers linked to the world of sorcery.24 The Art Museum's feather tunic is not by any means as extravagant as the vestment described in the foregoing para- graphs. By virtue (once again) of the symbolism attached to its components and the sheer overload of its surface, how- ever, it echoes aspects of the more complex shirt's appear- ance. The multimedia, skull-bedecked vestment bears undeniable ties to the shadow world of sorcery. Its Princeton counterpart flirts with the dark side. Glossy per- fection and surfeit, lushness and overload all meet in an ele- gant dance that positions The Art Museum's vestment on the edge, in the realm of light but not far from a place where dangerous powers are brought to bear. Expressions of ambiguity. In the end, the sense most pow- erfully evoked by works like The Art Museum's feather cloak may be ambiguity. Expressive of life and death- renewal and rebirth on the one hand, danger and the dark side on the other-they are neither quite this nor quite that, but both at once. This places them squarely in the realm of the chief, for he, more so than any, is a being of the thresh- old.25 What makes works like The Art Museum's tunic pow- erful is precisely this: their ambiguity and the intimate link this quality creates with thefo. It is also what renders them so interesting. For those who seek a better understanding of chiefly identity, they are inestimable resources. Encoded in the materials of which they are made and the manner in which these are brought together-encoded in the sense of excess they so gloriously convey-is a wealth of informa- tion about the fo's persona. In ways even richer, perhaps, than the masks and thrones so prized by Western collectors, these "soft" creations shed light on the complexities of what it means to be a chief in the Bamileke realm. 36</page><page sequence="22">NOTES This essay is dedicated to the memory of Dominique Kouankam Lele (i996-i999), the beautiful daughter of my research assistant and friend Victor Kouankam Loko. i.

Similar perceptions of accretion are found in many cultures south of the Sahara. In Bamana villages, accumulative sculpture is the province of a secret society called Komo. Komo's masks and altars, which are complete- ly covered with clusters of heterogeneous materials (mud, blood, feathers, porcupine quills, horns), are repositories for a force called nyama, so dan- gerous that it can only be handled by men versed in the most powerful forms of sorcery. In these works, the legibility and clarity of form so prized by sculptors of tyiwara headdresses are conspicuously absent. Illegibility is the dominant characteristic (McNaughton, Secret Sculptures of Komo). Much the same is true of tunics worn by Mande hunters, men known also for their ability to handle potentially lethal forces (Patrick McNaughton, "The Shirts that Mande Hunters Wear," African Arts I5, no. 3 [i982], 54-58). Altars erected in honor of wilderness spirits by Lobi farmers in Burkina Faso exhibit surfaces thick with the encrusted remains of sacrificial offerings (Piet Meyer, Kunst und Religion der Lobi [Zurich, i98i]). Boccio, works commis- sioned by Fon villagers of Benin to address such difficult issues as anger, mental illness, and death, in Suzanne Blier's words are "covered in . . . a 'garbage heap' of matter-iron, beads, straw, bones, leather, rags, pottery, fur, feathers, blood" (African Vodun: Art, Psychology, and Power [Chicago and London, I995], i). From the overloaded surfaces of these extraordinary objects, as from the bristling surfaces of nkisi nail figures and related mink- ishi carvings crafted by Kongo and Songye diviners in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, "emanate qualities of tension, anxiety, and danger" (ibid.). 23. Piasa Paris (auction house), Art africain: collection du Docteur Saris et a divers amateurs (1999), 44. 24. As in the multimedia garment described here, in such works as those men- tioned in note 22, above, one encounters allusions both to death and to life. Nyama, the force contained within Bamana Komo masks, is the force of life, present in each and every living being. In everyday quantities it is a blessing. It becomes deadly in the context of Komo because it is present in excessive amounts, in valences too powerful for all but the most experi- enced specialists to handle and withstand (McNaughton, Secret Sculptures of Komo). The potentially lethal forces Mande hunters face in their work are life forces as well; what makes them so dangerous is not their nature per se but their momentum, the burst of sheer energy they create when a living creature is felled (McNaughton, "Shirts"). Left to their own devices, the nature spirits propitiated by Lobi altars can do great harm; with attention and care, they can prove to be powerful allies (Meyer, Kunst und Religion). Fon boccio owe their innate strength not only to images they conjure of dis- ease, madness, and death but also (and in equal measure) to forces of life and renewal, which their successful activation is meant to draw forth (Blier, African Vodun). So too, if in different ways, Kongo nkisi figures and Songye minkishi used threats of aggression, danger, and death not to cause havoc but to keep it at bay: to make life possible.
