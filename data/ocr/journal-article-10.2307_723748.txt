<plain_text><page sequence="1">African Affairs (1997), 96, 5-23 RITUAL AS THE MEDIUM: A MODEST PROPOSAL WOLE SOYINKA THAT I FIND MYSELF DRAWN back to this theme, which I thought I had successfully disposed of from my mind through a number of variations over the past 30 years, has less to do with an evocation, or association, from the overall theme of this Symposium-MEDIUMS OF CHANGE-than with the simple fact that I find myself wondering lately if the European world is not undergoing some undeclared form of affliction masquerading as revelation, or even Art. Consequently I find myself compelled to seek protection for my own sanity by regressing into a world that I know best, one whose systems of perception and represen- tation also remain infinitely elastic and accommodative but may be said to be somewhat less promiscuous. That places me uniquely in a position to arbitrate between the arts, and especially the artistic pro- cesses, as engaged in by the African guests and contributors to this festival [africa '95] on the one hand, and their host environment on the other. Allied to this, is what the uninitiated might choose to dismiss as a mere coincidence. During these past few months, Great Britain, in a rare sympathetic identification with the rest of Europe, underwent the misery of an unprecedented prayer-fulfilment. The natives of this island have always dreamt of the perfect summer, this year [1995] they had it. Temperatures unheard of since the partitioning of Africa were recorded, not merely on the British Isles, but all over Europe. During that same period, an invasion by African visual artists, actors, cineastes, griots, musicians and critics, descended upon Great Britain, specially invited hither with all the bag and baggage of creative, and, inevitably, psychic energy. They are involved in a series of events that commenced on the continent itself and now move towards a climax on the soil of the organisers, who, I am convinced, do not appreciate even now just what imponderables they have unleashed upon John Major's domain. The unusual pattern of climactic extremes has been noted, but the just Wole Soyinka gave this Keynote Address at the Royal African Society's conference, Mediums of Change: the Arts in afEica '95. The conference was the opening event in the national festival africa '95. The Society wishes to thank the following for sponsoring the conference: Aycrican Arts Africa Private Enterprise Group; Arts Council of England- Barrow Cadbury Trust; Booker Tate; British Academy; British Airways; British Council; British Library National Sound Archive; Fondation en Afrique Creations; Ford Foundation; International African Institute; Island Records; AG Leventis Foundation; Morel Trust; Saccone &amp; Speed Ltd; School of Oriental &amp; African Studies (SOAS); Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA).</page><page sequence="2">6 AFRICAN AFFAIRS attribution is yet to come. Any failure to correlate this invasion with the abnormal temperatures experienced all over the British Isles indicates quite simply that the British remain trapped in their psychic under- development since the mysterious disappearance of their Stonehenge ancestors. The Whitechapel gallery will be playing host to an exhibition entitled 'Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa' whose concept is unique in a number of ways. What the pubic will see in fact is the harvest of a creative journey that was begun on the African continent, insofar as it relates to this festival, several journeys in fact. I was in on the beginning simply because the organisers of this part of the festival not only discussed their ideas with me when they visited Nigeria, but attempted to involve me at some level or the other. Since I was too preoccupied with more pressing commitments to respond positively, I hope the role I have now elected to play, a mediating role, (a medium in a way), will provide a small measure of compensation for my inability to write a preface to the exhibition catalogue, declare it open, or whatever else, I forget now, that they wanted me to do. I do not suggest for a moment that the artists will find themselves in an alien environment; most of them are seasoned travellers and have exhibited in European galleries. No, it is their works I am principally concerned with, and the current environment and creative tendencies in which those works have been thrust. As those who are familiar with my occasional incursions into the word of the visual arts will testify. I have a rather compulsive trait towards artistic anthropomorphism, even to the extent that I find myself constantly creating a sort of photo-dialogue for works of art. What are they saying to one another when the viewers have departed? Indeed, what observations of the viewers and their makers, even of their makers' ancestors, do they pass among themselves? They must have an opinion, surely. Browsing through the Art review pages, and individual reactions of the ordinary art viewers like you and me on the pages of Letters to the Editor, is unlikely to prove more illuminating than a visit to the Arts Gallery itself, but no one can be in any doubt which of the two provides the greater entertainment. What bothers me is that none of these commentaries, at least none that I have read, appears to consider what the art works themselves, often yoked together from the most incompatible cultural matrices, are saying to one another, if anything. They do stand for something after all; they transmit a culture, a sensibility, a tradition or a conscious break with tradition, all of which indicate the very opposite of a passive or inert object of contemplation. I was fascinated, for instance, by viewer's responses to that current chart-buster-the art work which consists of an actress reclining in a glass</page><page sequence="3">7 RITUAL AS THE MEDIUM cage. A group of Japanese tourists, according to one report, broke into giggles. A concerned citizen admitted that he found himself nervously wondering what the art-work would do if it needed a pee, or worse; while another was entranced by a transcendental moment, to judge by his awe-filled remarks, when the art-work wiggled its toes. No one has suggested that this was part of the artistic statement but I suspect that a muscular cramp, surreptitiously eased, would constitute, for that viewer, far too banal a causative factor. For me however, it all amounted to a belated vindication of what I have always insisted upon: that art-works are active participants in the entire creative enterprise. This particular work will probably end up writing an article or a book on its experience, or go on a talk-show. Probably visit another gallery and say Hello to other mem- bers of the species, even engage in critical observations much of which would have to be carefully examined for prejudicial overtones the result of professional jealousy. What else? We shall speculate on some pro- founder aspects of this potential activism as we enter the domain of art as a ritual process. Now, this rather unfair and unusual advantage of a distinct genre may be quite upsetting to the works of African artists at the Whitchapel gallery. They might even feel as if they have been brought here as inferior or second-class citizens, to be gawked at as mindless, even comatose exotica. This very real possibility, which would contradict the entire idea of bridging cultures, justifies my compensatory disposition towards a critical theory based on artistic anthropomorphism. In the words of the organisers, just to refresh our minds. The motivating idea is: To facilitate greater visibility, understanding and access to the arts of Africa, and access to the arts of Africa and the African diaspora in key institutions in the U.K. ... promote artist-led Pan-African programmes, collaboration and networks both within AfFica and the U.K.... to promote audience development. Obviously such a laudable manifesto of africa '95 does not stand a chance if, for example, a fellow Nigerian, nostalgic for the open-air suya, locally known here as kebab, dispensed in roadside stalls of Lagos and Sagamu, can only respond to a stuffed sheep in a London gallery with the lament: 'What a waste of good lamb kebab'. As for the African sculptures themselves, how do they feel about such neighbours? What mutual illumination is possible between them. This is the route I find most dependable for borderline art criticism, to which borderline art is surely entitled, that we attempt to penetrate the dialogue among art pieces when the doors are locked and the viewers have departed. And no one should imagine that such pieces dialogue only with their immediate neighbours; art, goes the truism, acknowledges no boundaries, So, the Wolof canvas or</page><page sequence="4">8 AFRICAN AFFAIRS a Shona sculpture looks out towards shall we say, Berlin? and what does it find? A fellow work of art, at least so proclaimed, which used to be known as the Reichstag. But now, thanks to a culture of economic surplus and in vindication of the principle that the devil will always find work for idle hands, our Shona visitor finds that an itinerant artist has utilised this building to advance monumentalism in the Arts to literally unprecedented heights! These reactions are understandable, but I believe that all such seeming contradictions, with a little help from the principles of Ritualism, are easily reconciled. Most people will agree that Nature, which happens to be the one reality we rarely dispute and unavoidably inhabit, does constantly renew itself, and much of the puzzles of human activity and preoccupations may easily be explained from this fact of life. In other words. The process of renewal is just as natural to the individual as it is to the collective, the community or society. The difference, I suspect, between cultures, is that some societies openly acknowledge, through celebratory or ritualistic acts, this need for renewal, while other prefer to believe that their community has developed beyond such a need, or at least beyond the structuring of such a need in communally inclusive modes. Indeed, they exist in a world of ritual repression, in which they remain until some individual, usually a creative person, bursts out of his individual cocoon and imposes his own ritualistic vision of renewal on the rest of the community. That commu- nity then gathers round, dutifully, sometimes sheepishly, and vicariously celebrates the event, little realising that they have in fact merely responded to the fulfilment of a long suppressed urge within them. Sometimes they admit to being puzzled. They do not quite know what to make of the event but, they know that it is something that relates to the community, something in which, willingly, unwillingly, or grudgingly, they are com- pelled to partake. A kind of communion, sacred or profane? They remain uncertain. As with all things however, when in doubt, the solution is to call it Art. In this latter kind of society therefore, it was only a matter of time before a public, historically notorious building called the Reichstag would be wrapped up, and tied up in sheets of polythene. Or a woman be placed in a glass cage and described as a work of Art. These activities occupy the same terrain of Art as a sometime preoccupation of naming and/or performance, such as the crucifixion of an entire animal, a sheep to be precise, pumped full of forlllaldehyde and placed on exhibition. In a previous 'artistic' event in the United States, the artist himself was the object, that is, he did not hire an actress or immolate a sheep but made himself both the creator and the medium. And presumably the message also? I forget what he did now, but it would qualify him for recognition as the precursor Beast Awakening to the Sleeping Beauty on current</page><page sequence="5">RITUAL AS THE MEDIUM 9 exhibition. These events should learn to acknowledge one another, I think, so that the newly inducted public can obtain a sense of continuity; not everyone after all, can keep up with the latest of such artistic adventures in all corners of the world. I am not totally persuaded of the sweeping statement in the Sunday Times Arts FOCUS Section which claims that 'the public has learnt over the past year that a dead sheep can be art'. Now that is where the problem really lies. If that comment had restricted itself to claiming, for instance, that a dead sheep can be a sight for jaded eyes, there would be little problem. An object of ritualistic import? There, my subjective inclinations would even take over and elaborate on such a theme in at least twelve variations. But Art in such a context provides universalist appropriation, and my immediate reaction was, 'what public?' Could it by any chance be that public of the Malian or Senegalese artist where a largely Muslim population ritualistically slaughters a ram for the feast of Ramadan? So what would a fellow tenant of that gallery from a far-flung corner of the world, or of another gallery within that same but distant environment, have to say about such a claim? Since the article in question makes a point of referring to the presence of foreign tourists among the spectators, it is of course possible that we are witnessing a purely business-wise venture designed to snatch customers away from that current runaway success of the tourist industry, Buckingham Palace. Galleries have to be competitive, and if the royal family took it into their heads to additionally commission the wrapping up of that institution in royal blue polythene, it would clearly be a case of no contest. Let the mind dwell on the possibilities for a moment. Even the spectacle of the mummified Reichstag would be flattened by the compe- tition, especially if the royal inmates consented to carry on normal life undemeath the shrouds. Many anti-royalists or republicans would con- tend that that institution already belongs under shrouds anyway, and that may well be the literal message of such a project, but we are not here to take sides, only to extend the province of this new-found medium of expression-polythene, canvas, tarpaulin, or any other convenient form of sheeting. Outside, the changing of the guards would continue, in slow motion, I would recommend. The guards are already trained not to blink even when tickled by spectators, so that would be no problem. Within, the occasional, muted tinkling of silver-ware on crested plates, the gurgle of wine from a crystal decanter. The occasional growl of the royal Corgi; all this, outside and within the ambiance of a shrouded palace, I propose, might prove even more artistically enriching than the traditional son et lumiere spectacle against the background of any historic architectural monument. Performed annually, it becomes a ritual</page><page sequence="6">10 AFRICAN AFFAIRS undertaking, offering not any profound insights into the processes of social change, but at least a glimpse or sensation of a symbolic commu- nal renewal. We shall return to this theme towards the end in a far more urgent, and African, context. Before then however, just an irresistible variant: I suspect that interior, as opposed to exterior mummification may actually induce far more visceral response in a viewer, as any director of Chekov's Cherry Orchard or its audiences would probably accept: I refer of course to the final scene of that play. Or indeed Miss Havisham's living morgue in Charles Dickens' Great Expectations. This emotional potential of the 'intern- ment' of an interior space, as opposed to an 'absence' that is imposed on the exterior monumentality of a structure, is not limited to the theatrical or literary experience alone. Any house hunter who has had the fortune to wander through an empty house in a quiet setting with all its furniture swathed in sheets armchairs, cupboards, piano, stools, balustrade and even carpets, an interplay of forms and planes in monochrome, dust motes dancing in light beams from the denuded windows, with either silence or muffled sounds for atmospherics will easily concede an intensification of the sensation of emptiness, married to eeriness that would drive the special effects department on stage or film to distraction with envy. It drove Marlon Brando to do something else of course, if my recollection of Last Tango in Paris serves me right, including an innovative use of margarine. But then, could this lay claim to the province of Art, a privileged artistic experience exclusive to the lucky homeseeker? After visiting the glass lady at the local gallery or wherever, shall we guide the art-lovers' feet to the nearest vacated building and collect entrance fees before they walk through the furniture turned static masquerades, up the winding stairs into the bedrooms, toilets and then down the fire-escape? The sensitive, original wood sculptures of the Ghanaian, E1 Anatsui, would, I suspect, utter more than a grunt of protest as they recollect how they were sawn in pieces, scarred by chisel and branded by hot irons to bear the weight of ancestral memory, or contemporary individual or social experience in their sadistic passage into the province of Art. Not that E1 Anatsui eschews the potentiality of accident, the objets trouves, especially in the world of wood; his com- pleted works testify to the contrary. Our intent here is simply to explore, question or validate where possible, the worlds of trans- formation that govern the creative impulse, and probe the elasticity of their boundaries. I understand that human faeces, better known as shit, are also in business. Now that, if nothing else, transcends metaphor and proposes itself as the terminal medium of change. I quote from that same Sunday Times essay, which was kind enough to convey to us the proclamation of the</page><page sequence="7">ll RITUAL AS THE MEDIUM new faecal avant-garde artist: 'We are part of an enormous heritage', the artist declared, 'and this is just another self-portrait ...'. Paint is finished, except in the abstract. As I pored over these illuminating paragraphs, my mind flew to I.R.A. prisoners-just two or three years ago protesting their prison conditions and utilising the handiest and most reliable supply of material to hand, their own shit. They smeared the walls with the stuff, covered themselves in it and resisted very attempt to sanitize their environment by simply hurling the projectiles at the warders. Some of these prisoners gave up the fight early on but, if my recollection serves me right, one or two actually succeeded in maintaining this creative form of protest for over a year, until their demands were met and changes made in their prison conditions. It occurs to me now that this must be the longest-running multi-media exhibitions in self- portraiture of its kind, and I wonder if the Guiness Book of Records has been apprized of the fact. afiica '95, exhibiting at the Whitechapel Gallery, had better understand that it is up against competition outside the normal experience of the contents of its 'Seven Stories-Modern Art in Africa', Modern Art? I'm afraid that more than one viewer might be inclined to adapt the bellow of that lady in the famous hamburger advertisement and scream 'Where's the shit?' Art, for the majority of the African participants, is often embedded in activities of participatory renewal. Naturally there is evolution, not merely in forms but in practice. If you visit the Sculpture Village in Harare, Zimbabwe, you will find a robust affirmation of this claim. The initiative for the establishment of this sculptural field, a sprawling open-air creative estate, belongs, ironically, to a European entrepreneur, but that is not unusual on our continent. Like the activities of another European, an Austrian, in Nigeria, this time an artist herself, Susan Wenger, we will find that these agents of renewal have merely responded to the tradition of living artistic communities, be these of pottery, sculpture, leatherworks, dyeing or bark-painting. Even when such an activity appears to be non-continuous, that is when the community comes together for an event, a ceremonial or celebration, the preparation, we find, is a continuous thread that unravels itself through- out the community in the preceding year, and intertwines with all other activities that produce the life of the community, trading, farming, building, social governance, etc. One obvious instance is the annual festival of Bobo-Dioulasso, in Burkina Faso, a spectacular outburst of the creative energies of an entire community that has been scattered in various urban centres, earning a living, during the year. Associated with the notion of a collective return, and this includes the formal burial</page><page sequence="8">12 AFRICAN AFFAIRS ceremonies, the return of the departed souls to their place of origin, those who had died during the year, preparations towards this collective renewal never really cease. Rather like the Brazilian or West Indian carnival, no sooner is one cycle ended than preparations for the next begin. Of course, by no stretch of the imagination does one claim that the Carnival is ritualistic in content although I had better be careful there. Maybe I should simply restrict myself to claiming that the ritual impulse has dissipated over time and spatial separation into pure spectacle. Increasingly better known is the Festival of Oshun in Nigeria, like many others almost today a touristic event, but one nonetheless which retains, internally, its function as a mechanism of cleansing and renewal for this Yoruba community in Western Nigeria. What is unique, and in this context, relevant to our theme, is the continuing transformation of the performance environment of this festival, thanks largely to the creative intensity of the earlier mentioned sculptor, Susan Wenger, for whom Oshogbo-that is the name of the town what harbours Osun grove- has become a permanent home over the past three decades. Nearly 40 years ago, this remarkable woman, now in her early eighties, stumbled into Oshogbo with her husband, Uili Beier. She came, she saw, and was conquered. Her artistic style underwent a total transformation, through a series of experimentations that sought to respond to a spirituality, an essence that was at one and the same time alien to her but also intensely congenial. It was only a matter of time before she began her efforts to transform the environment, taking as cue the communal patterns and rhythms of creativity that were as old as the grove of Oshun itself. The uniqueness, the fortune of this particular spot, is that it combines what I have remarked as a vast creative estate, in contrast with the artificially sponsored example of Harare, with an organic creative process that involves the entire community and reaches its climax in the annual festival of renewal within that same environment. I believe it is this element that has saved it from suc- cumbing, despite official and business interests, to the cruder touristic malforlllations that come naturally with the popularization of most sacred performance events. Just one more example of artistic renewal-integration, another pertinent example in its own right, since it is from within this particular environment that a truly remarkable crop of artists has emerged from Nigeria, evolving not only artistic movements and schools such as the Uli school, but remarkable individual artists Uche Okeke, Bruce Onabrakpeya, the Ghanaian born E1 Anatsui (he is of course a unique study in himself) Obiora Udechukwu, etc. The first consciously established contemporary</page><page sequence="9">13 RITUAL AS THE MEDIUM artistic community in Nigeria, Mbari, took its name from this artistic tradition of the Igbo people. Mbari is the name given to the collections of sculptures, often to be found singly or in groups of the Igbo landscape, mostly hidden in bushes, left to collapse and decay in the weather. Made mostly of mud, they are painted over both in pastel and striking hues. Even the 'houses' in which the figures are sometimes sheltered form part of the total sculptured scene, as are the animal figures and objects which adorn what might be a domestic situation, a royal or religious procession or the depiction of a special event in the calendar of the people. Far more significant in the lives of these people however is the process that results in these artifacts, one which integrates the community as one, even as it identifies the chosen among them for this homage to the earth goddess, Ala. The artistes are selected by revelation from the priest, although there are also cases where the individual artiste obtains his inspiration directly from godhead. The collective process results in the isolation of the chosen artist in a specially built compound and huts erected by the community. They are led into this space in a celebratory procession by the entire village, after which they are shut off from the world entirely. They undergo a process of purification and communion, and then commence work, remaining within the com- pound for weeks, sometimes months. Depending on the fecundity of the artistic impulse, they might remain within for almost a year, fed and nourished by the community; the Arts Council of Great Britain may wish to take note. All mundane preoccupations are banished: the artist devotes himself or herself entirely to the activity of a homage to earth and its goddess, Ala, through a replication of her own act of . . creatlvlty. When they indicate their readiness, the outer wall is ceremonially taken down, the sculptures are consecrated and, for a while, the environ- ment of these artworks is carefully tended and sometimes, the sculptures themselves are renovated as needed, a new coat of paint here and there, restoration to some cracks in the figures etc. When later, the priest obtains yet another vision for a new act of homage, the earlier sculptures are left to fend for themselves. They are overgrown by foliage, collapse or survive out of sight of humans, obeying the rhythms of birth and decay as an integrated product of Nature. Do observe that individually inspired artistes, working in their own secluded spaces, also undergo the same process of purification, seclusion communal care and outing. I would be personally intrigued to learn if the community has ever had cause to reject a case of the individual call-I have yet to hear of any. Imagine the village equivalent of the passionate debates provoked in</page><page sequence="10">14 AFRICAN AFFAIRS the Bundestag by that artist who had this divine inspiration to wrap the Reichstag. I was most intrigued that he had spent ten years trying to persuade the village council in Bonn before a final vote was taken and the project approved by a slim majority. Perhaps curiosity was the deciding factor. What would it be like eventually? A giant from outer space? An evocation of some extinct species? Was there perhaps at long last a triggering alive of the repressed memory of some ancestral beings who once dominated the planet and tamed the mastodons as household pets? A petrification from a lost city? Or would it prove a mystic evocation of godhead? The process is, I suspect, the message in this case, and that message is Art as ritual. If one can do away with media hype, or the clever commercialization of the process hundreds of thousands of postcards were eventually sold, I understand, and tourists flocked in their thousands to witness the performance, or simply to be spectators after the event it becomes possible, using the Mbari as an indicative, to understand why this seeming dictatorship of individual inspiration, or exhibitionism, was not only permitted but embraced by many. I suspect that even where the element of the ritualistic in artistic creation has become attenuated in cultures, its place has remained embedded in the artistic subconscious, erupting from time to time in seemingly outrageous but simply vengeful directions. I would hesitate to suggest that the mounting of a stuffed sheep is perhaps an attempt to return to ancestor worship of transmigration culture: I am not aware of the existence of a sheep-based ancestor worship or the totemic in any culture-cows, bulls yes, snakes, rams and elephants; the sheep appears to be not so popular and perhaps this is an attempt to correct that deficiency. No matter, I would be prepared to venture the suggestion that the artist is attempting to provoke the mythic imagination at its most literal, prodding awake an arc of the collective unconscious through the ritualization of the artistic process. And just as no one in his right senses would suggest that ALL the figures that are produced through the Mbari medium are classic, even mature examples of African sculptural capability, so would it be equally questionable to ascribe, automatically, the category of art to the sheepish mound of fur that has been hung up as an object of adoration in some gallery or the other. Making it an intellectual question, is it art or is it not?, merely obscures its function as a potential instrument in the ritualization of Art or even, as communal therapy. Since I did not see it, I can only discuss concepts, but I frankly doubt if it could have been effective. For one thing, unlike the Reichstag, or an least comparatively speaking, it is disadvantageously positioned. Unless of course, and here we come to the mother and father of all ritualism, unless of course, we are willing to accept the now clearly demonstrated reality of anthropormorphic art.</page><page sequence="11">15 RITUAL AS THE MEDIUM To understand this fillly, we must return to the Sleeping Beauty, an even more blatant objective of adoration. Do we encounter here, perhaps, a regressive hearkening of the British psyche to its not so ancient days of ritual sacrifice? The contemporary Britisher, accus- tomed to cannibal jokes which are constantly located in the heart of Africa, the South Pacific and the Amazonian jungles, will obviously find it difficult to accept that cannibalism was part of the culinary culture of his ancestors, and not that far back in history. Vestiges of that primordial appetite resurge from time to time, even today, as attested by notorious trials of bloody goings-on in witches' covens, black magic rites etc. especially in secluded cottages and borrowed churches of the British countryside. We are not speaking here merely of the straightforward gluttons, or gourmets, depending on ones point of view-such as Son of Sam, with his selective taste for homosexual partners, or his Russian counterpart, recently arrested, who appeared to have manifested a far more eclectic palate. I am referring to actual cases of human sacrifice, the ritualistic smearing of the body with, and drinking of the victim's blood, activities which, I repeat, are far more common in the British Isles than many suspect. After all, we only know of the ones who are caught and charged in court. Well, let us concede that these practices are few and far between; the point here is that the otherwise genteel British society learns from time to time, that certain elemental aspects of the rites of Nature described as primitive by anthropologists sometimes find ready mediums within that same community. What we are offered, therefore, in this particular context, is the function of the artist as the arch-priest of the community, instigating or presiding over the rites of procreativity. This should not be difficult to understand, given the parlous state of religion in the country at the moment, and the continuing search of its populace for some kind of spiritual anchor. Of course there are echoes also of the fairy tale, but let us not forget that the Sleeping Beauty tale is itself a whittling down of the more primal rites of Spring, and this, I propose, is what our artiste is really after. Some might object on the grounds that it is stretching credulity too far to suggest that the sleeping figure, a well-known actress, is a virgin, a condition which, as any schoolboy knows, is an essential qualification for the role of the sacrificial victim. That, however, is where the creative input is to found. Not for nothing was an actress chosen for this role; her passive function, and here we are really obliged to see that display case as a luscent sarcophagus, is tO act the virgin, to diffuse an aura of vulnerable virginity whose awakening, with a symbolic kiss or brutal ravishing, will fructify the land. I am an optimist you will perhaps have gathered by now, not merely on behalf of Art but for community. I tend to believe that, at the end of it all,</page><page sequence="12">16 AFRICAN AFFAIRS there is not only a positive intent by the creators but that, despite itself, even slumbering Nature has been surprised into responding to this ritual provocation. Unbelievers are free to go their way, but I must now return you to the trail I laid out at the beginning, namely, that, not merely Great Britain but most of Europe had suffered one of the severest heat waves and droughts recorded in any summer. Weather forecasters had become attuned to predicting heat and more heat, with no rain in sight anywhere. The land was parched. The level in water reservoirs sank to the lowest ever recorded for the time of the year. The vistas of William Blake's 'green and pleasant land' had turned to the blasted heath of Sango, the god of thunder after he committed the impious act of imprisoning the innocent Obatala, the god of purity and creation. The complacement executives of the British Water Authority were beginning to feel the heat from John Major's government, deliver rain, or else! The entire nation was on heat. And, then, suddenly, when all seemed lost, the skies opened and the land was saved. Now, what no one has bothered to ask is: what brought the rain? It is sad that the arrogance of science had obscured the claims of magic in the evocation of nature forces. My opening comments might lead you to suspect that I am about to give credit to the presence (and psychic-creative) input of the African invaders for the final defeat, or the appeasement, the assuaging of heat and drought, for which they should be held responsible. Let us note however, that the already cited theme of this Festival can be expressed in many ways, cross-fertilisation included, and it strikes me as only logical that where one part of a collaborative artistic effort provides heat, the other should respond with rain. In words from the liturgical drama of Sango, god of lightning and thunder and, by . .. . . mpllcatlon, ram: Se b'omi ni o pa'na Se b'omi n i o pa'na (Is it not water that douses fire? Is it not water than douses fire.&gt;) That there are, undoubtedly, formidable rain-makers among the African contingents, is not in question, but I do not believe that the British government was even aware of their approach; indeed, judging from the near-insurmountable problems many had to obtain visas for their voyage here despite being armed with letters of invitation, it is highly improbable that the British government, much less the British Water Authority is aware of the existence of this Festival, so there could not have been any commission to the artistes to bring their rain-making kits with them. The ending of the long drought must therefore be</page><page sequence="13">17 RITUAL AS THE MEDIUM considered one of these extremely rare, but fortunate instances of ritual . . serendlplty. In case my digressions have taken you off the track, may I remind you that we were on the subject of the Rites of Spring, the symbolic sacrifice or deflowering of a virgin as prelude to rebirth of Nature and the community. It goes without saying that Art transcends literalism, so we must not permit ourselves to be sidetracked by the fact that the next European season happens to be autumn, and the preceding, summer, so that Spring superficially cannot, strictly speaking, be relevant to our mythological construct. Spring means rebirth however, and the transition between drought and rain should be evident even to a microchip culture as identical to that between winter and spring. And our present puzzle is simply how to account for the unprecedented spell of drought, or hot winter, finally routed and replaced by rain, or moist Spring. 'The colours, the forms, the figures come alive!' Now that is an exclamation that must be familiar to audiences, students, or participants in art sessions. A painting, they insist, comes alive. While such expositors are not really engaged in propositions of the direct anthropomorphization of art at its most literal, such as we encounter in Oscar Wilde's Portrait of Dorian Gray, of its genre in science-fiction or supernatural cinema, of which the pulp-surreal cinema in my own Nigeria has become a really mind-boggling exemplar, there is more than enough matter for serious thought in that vivification metaphor employed in critical commentary. Suppose, just suppose those colours, forms and figures do come alive indeed, I mean, who knows that actually happens when the doors of the Tate Gallery are shut at night. Imagine Malangatana's night-club ha- bituees let loose with Bruegel's purgatorial or visionary post-atom bomb creations. Or the habituees of William Blake's kingdom suddenly beamed into the foetal variations of Skunder Bhogossian? Who is to tell what ritual mythologies are fulfilled when the stuffed sheep comes alive and encounters the reclining forlil of the Sleeping Beauty? If a living actress can fulfil a role that is the normal attribute of a painted or sculpted figure, then we must assume (i) that the two protagonists can indeed interchange roles and (ii) that there is a transitional territory of reality and image that both inhabit, one within which they can transform themselves. Now, I am well aware that none of the gallery curators or security staff has reported any so-called unnatural act within the gallery premises, and even the closed-circuit video cameras have yet to entrap any of these denizens of the artists' imaginative habitations in necrophiliac experimentation. All we can tell is that after prolonged drought that brought even chronic sun- worshippers gasping for breath, and just when the stuffed sheep, the enchanted castle (formerly named the Reichstag) and the Sleeping Beauty had attained iconic prominence in the psychic awareness of the</page><page sequence="14">18 AFRICAN AFFAIRS community, the spell was broken, the dome of the universe cracked, and what offspring do we expect from the ritual union of a stuffed sheep and a sleeping beauty in an enchanted castle? Of course, it began to rain cats and dogs. We must be careful therefore not to rush to judgement. It is possible that our problem is simply one of calling things by the wrong name, and failing to accept that even the possibility of a wrongful categorization does not annul the value, albeit in a different field of any activity of the imagination, or the physical result of such activity. Ritualism may prove far more socially enlightening and uplifting than the paraphenalia, or the material residuum of the ritual process itself that we name, or misname, Art: indeed, the overwhelming evidence suggests that it is. Our concern, if we are truly committed to assuaging society's thirst for change, is to turn the ritual process into socially beneficient results, and this is where, having acknowledged their contribution to a common cause, I propose to part company, partially at least, with the visual artists that have been at the centre of this discourse so far, and conclude with the ritualism with which I am far more at home, namely the theatrical. They are all linked of course, as I have stressed in my Buckingham Palace mummification project, a project that deals with merely symbolic power, quite unlike the Reichstag whose historic associations are somewhat more sinister, even downright diabolic. The Nigerian National Theatre is another candidate, a monstrous slab of alienation whose architectural profile, to damm it utterly, has also been likened quite accurately to a General's hat, and therefore symbolises the bane of much of that continent today, a militarist dominance that requires some desperate process of exorcism. Perhaps Nature has already taken a hand in that process by attempting to suck that structure down into its terminal bosom; it would appear that insufficient piling was carried out for its foundations and it is now sinking gradually into the swamps. However, not all countries on the continent plagued by dictators have such obvious symbols or other power-glorifying structures to wrap up symbolically, making them vanish, thus exorcising power and ritualistically restoring the community to itself, cleansed of the evil fumes of state coercion and liberated into its own potential. Since the artist-priest would probably get shot out of hand in the first place for attempting to obscure the symbols of dominance even for a second, a different approach is obviously called for, one that would respond to the essence of power and gratify the sense of afflatus of our persistent crop of petty dictators. My modest proposal was not, let me hasten to add, inspired by the artistic tendencies under earlier discussion; indeed, I first flew this kite at a symposium organised by the World Bank several years ago in Washington D.C., so you can see rightaway that there is nothing fey about it, since I</page><page sequence="15">19 RITUAL AS THE MEDIUM knew I was addressing hard-headed men and women who dealt in dollars and cents and needed practical ideas about how to utilize the resources at their disposal and make them yield steady profits. They had a problem with some incontinent regimes poor men and could not understand why development appeared to be a non-concept for the leaders of such nations. It was my duty to educate them about the nature of such dictators, then propose a comparatively economic method of easing them out of office without depriving them of the drug to which they had become terminally addicted, I devised a scheme, rather elaborate. I shall provide here just the climactic part of that project, it being especially relevant to the principles of art ritualism that we have observed in the Sleeping Beauty and the Reichstag wraparound. It is accompanied by a no less elaborate prelude, but presenting the totality here would diffuse the essence of those immediate references we have utilised so far. The proposed ritual owed its inspiration, I strongly suspect, firstly to the egungun masquerade that is, the ancestor cult in my own and other African traditions. But first, let us understand quite clearly why this proposal makes sense over and above any other: it requires an under- standing of what these men of power really lust after, apart from power, that is. We know that already, but then, having killed, tortured, and raped to obtain that power, what makes them desperate to remain at whatever cost terminally within power? To claim that power is an end in itself simply does not satisfy; there has to be something beyond it, something of great sublimity that eludes the ordinary mind. Thanks, however, to the aforesaid tradition of the Yoruba, and one other, this time, a foreign source. I finally stumbled on the answer. That other source is Jean Genet, and really that should not be surprising, since Genet is unquestionably a ritualist par excellence, indeed an obsessive one. A third, subsidiary contender may be traceable to personal experi- ence, one that is not granted most mortals; I shall acknowledge that . . . . su z1ectlve aspect m passmg. Earlier, I made what might have sounded a hubristic claim, that my proposal cannot be challenged because it is based on a penetration of the mystery of what lies beyond the lust for power. And of course this implies that this discovery remain in itself unassailable. Let us consider this: what is it, of all the gratifications open to all the controls that power exercises; what is the one thing that power cannot guarantee to its custodian and monopolist? Wealth? Unlimited access. Sex? Ask and it shall be given. Pomp? Circumstance? Domination? A11 implicit in the condi- tion of power. Adulation? Deification? The list is endless. Only one experience in the province of power remains inaccessible to the holder and that one experience is-but let us prepare the groundwork for this revelation.</page><page sequence="16">20 AFRICAN AFFAIRS The majority of rulers, judging by their exercise of power in office, cannot be comprehended unless one accepted the a przori idea that they are propelled by an incurable death-wish. That was what I claimed at the time of my original proposal but I have since revised that idea, in light of what I call my ultimate revelation. What constitutes that compulsive 'sit-tight' syndrome, as we call it in my part of the world, is not so much a death-wish as a death-experience fixation. Yet even that may be gratified, for we know that what is often referred to as a 'narrow escape' from the assassin's bullets of bombs comes so close to death-experience that rulers, with their lax imagination, may take it for the real thing and be thereby satisfied. So we shall take it one level further: we have to be absolutely satisfied that this missing commodity is something that a ruler cannot, despite his omnipotence, undergo in his life-time, and so we arrive at their ultimate deprivation and source of frustration, it is not so much the death experience itself, but a state funeral. In distinguishing between a dictator's state funeral fixation and the death-wish that we have now discarded, we are obliged to seek vindica- tion in cultural usage which, needless to say, differs from society to society. Take Yoruba society, the land of the egungun, or ancestral masquerade: there, the celebration of death is no less than a long- running feast of theatre. There are separate but linked acts such as the wake-keeping, the lying-in-state, processions by professional mourners, then the funeral service, the processional to the graveside, followed by the recessional with drumming and dancing. Eight days later comes the outing, 'the turning over of the body' ceremonies-purely symbolic, be reassured, the mouldering corpse is not actually exhumed, then the forty-day sloughing-off of the mourning visage and physical accoutrements. Depending on age and social status, all this is marked by feasting, acrobatic displays, elaborate masquerades, indeed, an all but carnival atmosphere. The Irish, and some Eastern European countries, I understand, do approach something of the spirit of such festivals but, they will accept, I trust, that they lag a long way behind the various African models. Now, a full-blown state funeral is only a hard-cover edition of the commoner's plain text of lying in state in his suburban parlour or courtyard, the missing adjuncts of feast and spectacle in the former being compensated by the bugling of the Last Post, the lowering of flags, the gun-carriage and slow, precision marches etc. And so, even allowing for some element of cultural bias, I do insist that the African commoner's 'offices of the dead' are some of the most elaborate and magnificent of all the world cultures that I know of. Even Muslims, who are less inclined towards this necromantic ostentation, now demonstrate their conversion through full-page media eulogies to the dead) of increasing vulgarity and</page><page sequence="17">21 RITUAL AS THE MEDIUM extravagance. With this cultural background in mind, we can proceed to accept the proposition that even what appears to be a death-wish in the disposition of our self-perpetuating, or sit tight rulers, is nothing but a fidelity to cultural usage in funeral matters. Dictators kill to stay alive, not to nourish a death-wish. Their frustration lies simply in their inability to obtain a gratification that is by nature terminal, one that they cannot enjoy, despite their omnipotence. In the mental recesses of many of them, the question, even as they cling to power is: will I end up like Sergeant Doe? And they go to hideous lengths to ward off the nightmare, placing an intolerable burden on the populace. But they need not end up like Sergeant Doe, or they can spite such an unfortunate denouement beforehand, by savouring their chosen end before the event. Even the very worst terminal scenarios, such as Sergeant Doe's or Macais Nguema's, would become vitiated by the authenticity and experiencing of an end that they have themselves willed, one which they have played both protagonist and creator. This is where Ritual comes to the rescue. Suppose we were able to come up with a scheme that guarantees their mortal survival with an enjoyment of that crowning experience of their career, does that not solve everything? Jean Genet had anticipated this problem in The Balcony: lacking the benefit of a culture like mine however, he was unable to translate his vision into a viable project. He failed to realise that The Balcony is the quintessential ritual blueprint for the problems of dictator- ship in our time. With the example of the egungun in mine however, I have been able to translate Genet's vision into a practical ritualistic project for rescuing society from the unsated hunger of dictators for that which even they may remain unaware of-participation in their own moment of apotheosis a state funeral. Here now are details of our project: under the supervision of an architect of his choosing, we would construct for each dictator a mausoleum of his dreams. A professional ceremonial or theatre director would be engaged to plan, with each, his fantasy funeral. Rehearsals would be conducted with lowered flags, orchestras, horse drawn or motorised carriage, some love the rhythm of those metal-shod hooves etc. which motorcades cannot provide. Professional mourners and praise-singers would be engaged. Our hero would be free to sleep from time to time in his mausoleum, just to get the feel of it, he would try it for size, savour the colour schemes, order alterations, re-award the contract as often as he likes and generally enjoy a unique privilege, one that very few of us, just the occasional crank or two here and there I think, ever experience in our lives. Even I have never undergone this experience, though of course I have been privileged to read and even listen to the broadcast version of my obituary; this was the other strand of inspiration that I mentioned earlier. By contrast, our</page><page sequence="18">22 AFRICAN AFFAIRS living hero can supervise the writing and personally rehearse the orator for his funeral eulogies. Indeed, he can deliver and record his own oration. He can choose to immortalise his mortality on video, beam all or any aspect of his obsequies onto giant screens and watch his lavishly decorated coffin solemnly lowered into a marble, stainless steel, mahogany or whatever mausoleum. All this he can experience, whenever the mood takes him, in performance after recorded performance in his own lifetime. Is this scheme of value only to Third World countries under the iron heels of dictatorship? Of course not. Western democracies must not consider themselves deprived of the benefits of this scheme, and our contention is that the mummification of the Reichstag, which we have attempted to project onto Buckingham Palace and other accessible structures of authority, real, symbolic, benevolent or diabolical, is the artistic recognition of the communal need to periodically immobilize power in the ritual mode. The Sleeping Beauty should become a model transposed socially onto the landscape of intractable problems whose causative symbols would thus be ritualistically immured for the regenera- tion of society. Great Britain would be a much better place today, I am certain, if Margaret Thatcher had been compelled to pose in a glass cage every dry season or winter and not let out until spring or the guarantee of rainfall. Obviously far more drastic versions of these ritualistic state- ments would be required for the Nicolae Ceausescu of the world- anyone who has had the dubious privilege of seeing and entering the Palais de la Grande Folie in Bucharest will agree that, even putting aside their crimes against society, for such an architectural crime alone, some dictators deserve to be placed permanently in a glass cage and progressively deprived of oxygen. But I must not permit these negative fantasies to detract from the fundamental value of our ritualistic propositions, the most important of which is that power thrives on adoration, of which the most viscerally experienced is self-adoration, and we do know that death is one occasion of both public and self-adoration that is closed to the protagonist. The experience of adoration in death is thus the one offering inaccessible to power that can be made by any community that finds itself trapped in the vice of power, to bring performance art in its ritualist mode, to the rescue, while fulfilling the craving of power where it remains eternally tantalised. Retire peacefully from office with all its uncertainties, enjoy the trappings of power in a series of prelude scenarios which we shall not go into on this occasion, for the reasons I have already given, but which also utilises the prolixity of ritual as vessel of gratification, but above all, and as a re- current climax-a guarantee of a state funeral with all desired pomp and circumstance.</page><page sequence="19">RITUAL AS THE MEDIUM 23 From the world of Art and Ritual, this is one offer, I am certain, that no dictator can refuse.</page></plain_text>
