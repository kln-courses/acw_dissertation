<plain_text><page sequence="1">"OPENING THE BLUE OF HEAVEN TO US":1 READING ANEW THE PIONEERS OF WOMEN'S ORDINATION Pamela S. Nadell "Seeking the face of God, striving to live in His presence and to fashion the life of holiness appropriate to God's presence- these have ever been the core of that religious civilization known to the world as Judaism." Arthur Green, Jewish Spirituality2 In their landmark volume, Four Centuries of Jewish Women's Spirituality, Ellen Umansky and Dianne Ashton gathered scores of Jewish women's reli- gious reflections.3 Recognizing and seeking to fathom the deep wellsprings of Jewish women's spirituality have propelled much of the research of the pio- neering generation of Jewish feminist scholars. For example, Chava Weissler saw in the tkhines, the private prayers of early modern Ashkenazi Jewish women, "a directness of passionately emotional personal prayer, mostly absent from the more collective and formalized male worship experience."4 Anthro- pologist Susan Starr Sered opened up the deep, non-textually based piety of the "religious lives . . . of the illiterate, uneducated, but spiritually attuned elderly Jewish women of the East."5 Umansky, Ashton, Weissler, Sered, and other scholars have established unequivocally that spirituality is as central a rubric for understanding the lived experiences of Jewish women of the past as it is for comprehending the history of Jewish men, whose prayer and sacred study lay so visibly at the heart of Jewish communal life for millennia.6 Yet this theme of Jewish women's spirituality is one I ignored for the cohort I called Women Who Would be Rabbis (1988). In that book, I wrote of women like Ray Frank, the "girl rabbi of the golden West"; Martha Neumark, the rabbinical school student who thought she should have a high holiday pulpit; and Irma Levy Lindheim, the Zionist leader and friend of Jewish Institute 88 NASHIM: A Journal of Jewish Women 's Studies and Gender Issues. © 2005</page><page sequence="2">Reading Anew the Pioneers of Women's Ordination of Religion President Stephen S. Wise. I argued that the women who would, if they could, have been rabbis unknowingly conducted a debate across time and space, beginning at the end of the nineteenth century. Largely unaware of those who had preceded them in raising the possibility that women could be rabbis, these women studied over and over again the same religious texts, discovering each time, as if de novo, that there was not a single statement in all the sources of Jewish tradition excluding women from the rabbinate. Then, for additional prooftexts, each paraded a long list of the learned Jewish women of the past, uncovering how their engagement in sacred study had conferred upon them the authority to teach and even on occasion the legitimacy to rule.7 I viewed the women enmeshed in the debate over women's ordination largely as students, as scholars, as readers of Jewish texts. Because of the argu- ments I made in Women Who Would Be Rabbis, I disregarded what, if anything, these women had to say about whether or not they read their encounter with such texts as a spiritual exercise. As I read their writings, I skipped over the parts where they began to reflect specifically upon living "life in the presence of God." Since these musings did not advance my argument, they did not then interest me. But a popular interest in spirituality has emerged since I wrote that book, along with a growing literature on women's spiritual narratives. In Sentimen- tal Confessions, a 2001 study of the spiritual narratives of nineteenth-century African American women, Jocelyn Moody railed against feminist scholars who tended, as I had, "to overlook, to 'read around' the spiritual dimensions present" in autobiographical narratives. Accusing Christian feminist scholars of neglecting "an essential and vital aspect" of these texts, she argued that "faith in the mystical need not be seen as an indication of imbecility."8 In Holy Boldness, Susie Stanley's 2002 study of women preachers' autobiographies, she uncovered a substantial cohort of women in the Protestant Wesleyan/Holi- ness tradition whose writings chronicled their spiritual growth.9 Moody 's and Stanley's scholarship and the call for essays on spirituality for this special issue of Nashim convinced me to turn once again, with a different set of questions, to some of the narratives written by the women who would have been rabbis. Did the Jewish women who argued for women's ordination write of their striving "to fashion the life of holiness appropriate to God's presence"? If so, were there commonalities to their spiritual experiences, like those gleaned from their study of sacred texts? Rereading the words of three of the women who entered the debate affirms that they indeed left behind spiritual narratives. 89</page><page sequence="3">Pamela S. Nadell The first is Ray Frank, who launched her remarkable career on the Jewish New Year in 1890, when she preached in Spokane Falls, Washington. Frank, a teacher, religious school principal, and journalist, spent much of the next decade preaching and teaching to America's Jews in diverse settings, espe- cially in the West and the Midwest. Her original prayers opened and closed the historic gathering of the Jewish Women's Congress at the 1893 Columbian World's Exposition. Even as she claimed that she had no intention of becom- ing a rabbi, the popular attention she received in the press, which erroneously called her the first woman rabbi, raised debate about the ordination of Jewish women.10 Frank's preaching reveals her spiritual concerns- about how to pray, how to reach God, and how to know God. Writing about her after her death, her husband, Simon Litman, characterized her life as "dedicated to a search for truth and beauty, to the expounding of what Ray considered divine in religion and art," to bringing "a touch of the infinite to the congregants."11 How to sanctify life stands out as the theme of Frank's literary legacy.12 She understood that prayer is boundless in its blessings; that all good desires come through this source; that earthly success must make it the staff on which to lean; [that it] tur- neth darkness into light, trouble into rejoicing and openeth the blue of the heaven to us.13 But rote repetition of prayer, unaccompanied by devotion, was anathema to Frank. She wanted "[spontaneous prayer [which] is actual communion with God; it is rarely long but it is so deep that only angels can fathom it." Deriding "our present poor apology for religious worship," she called for the innovation of congregational singing. She believed: God has given us no forms by which He is to be worshipped. All that is perfectly sincere is acceptable if in accordance with the commandments and all that tends to His glorification must be right in His sight.14 She wrote especially about Jewish women's spiritual mission. She chal- lenged those assembled at the 1893 Jewish Women's Congress "to first make of our homes temples." There they would imitate the "joyously peaceful . . . orthodox Friday night" of the Sabbath-observant home.15 If they did this, it 90</page><page sequence="4">Reading Anew the Pioneers of Women's Ordination would not matter "[i]f the synagogues are then deserted[.] [L]et it be because the homes are filled, then we will be a nation of priests; edifices of worship will be everywhere."16 In 1893, Frank, then in her early thirties and unmarried, wrote: "Nothing can replace the duty of the mother in the home." Mothers must lead their children from the sacred space of their homes to the holy grounds of the synagogue. Their "work in and for the synagogue lies in bringing to the Temple the Samu- els to fulfill the Law." But those whom she called "mothers in Israel"17 had an even greater responsibility for their children's spiritual lives. They were to teach the children to pray: Tell your children . . . that just as a mother in a darkened room holds fast the hands of a child to quiet his fears, so God's love reaches out through every darkness, through every trouble, waiting for prayerful sincerity to clasp it and be comforted. Mothers' deeply sacred tasks could bring about redemption. "[F]or almost nineteen hundred years," Frank wrote, "the body of historic Judaism has been rent and torn. Only its God-given spirit has remained changeless; still bless- ing us with purity and peace." But if mothers fulfilled their task, if they led "the man-child, [to] strong love of the Eternal, to his Maker," then "Mothers, ye can restore Israel's glory, can fulfill the prophecy."18 Frank's personal piety ran deep and was tinged with mystical overtones. Her sermon "Why I Preach" finds her soaring above "my desk into the space, as faster and faster I go away from valleys, up hills, through gorges, over moun- tains," until "below me lies the world of man." There she sees emblazoned the "mysterious flaming words 'For Thee, for Thee.'" Ultimately, she meets an angel who leads her to the "tree of knowledge of good and evil." There, so she writes, "I kneel and raise my hands in adoration of the Eternal." She concludes: "I knowing this, feel I must, wherever and whenever I can preach my message."19 And Frank did so, until her marriage in 1899. In an era when the overwhelming majority of middle-class wives shunned public careers, marrying a professor put an end to her calling as the "girl rabbi of the golden West" and assigned her the new role of faculty wife. Two decades later, other Jewish women sparked new conversations about ordaining women. As revealed in their autobiographical writings, they, too, crafted spiritual narratives reflecting on life lived in the presence of God. In 91</page><page sequence="5">Pamela S. Nadell 1921, 17-year-old Martha Neumark was a student at the Reform movement's Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, where her father, David Neumark, was Professor of Philosophy. She asked the college for a high holiday pulpit assignment; on the coming Days of Awe, she wanted to lead a small Jewish community in prayer, just as her male classmates would. That request, dem- onstrating that Neumark indeed saw herself as being on the way to becoming a rabbi, launched a two-year debate in the world of Reform Judaism. Would its leaders, who had already sanctioned so many other transformations in traditional praxis, cross the gender divide and ordain women? In the end, the College's Board of Governors voted against women's ordination, and Martha Neumark never became a rabbi.20 Unlike Ray Frank, whose sermons are a window onto her spiritual legacy, Neumark's spiritual concerns are revealed largely in the autobiographical reflections she wrote for the press after her hopes for ordination were dashed. She recalled that as a child she was so "deeply and sincerely religious" that she was "shocked" when children whom she knew would never misbehave in public school did so in Sunday School. For Neumark, that setting "and everything over which religion haloed its glamour appeared particularly sacrosanct."21 She carried that reverence to worship and wrote of how it inspired her. It was her confirmation service that made her resolve to become a rabbi: I was one of those who read from the Torah in Hebrew, and the recitation of those ancient words crystallized a vague restlessness of mine into the desire to serve my people. Later, she had the opportunity to "read services" at a summer resort, where as she "incanted the Hebrew ... the witchery and charm of the service surged through me." She searched in her studies at Hebrew Union College for other glimpses of the holy. On the one hand, she described the college as holding "a certain touch of the old Yeshivoth ... It was only the modernity of the surroundings which kept one from believing that one was in ancient Sura or Pumbeditha." Yet she also knew that the College failed to nourish her "mystic nature" sufficiently. She wrote: 92</page><page sequence="6">Reading Anew the Pioneers of Women's Ordination I hold that religion can be made into beauty, and that true religion always is. The ritual and ceremony were what I missed. The mystic, Oriental atmo- sphere, necessary for the encouragement of any aesthetic soul was lacking. She came to embrace these elements as "invaluable adjuncts to a religious communion." In these articles, Neumark also articulated her understanding of God, gained under the tutelage of her father, who was a rabbi as well as a professor. David Neumark believed that even as Judaism had evolved in the past and would continue to do so, ethical monotheism had always lain at its core, and the task of Jewish philosophy was to explicate and refine man's understanding of this core. Because, as he understood it, the Bible was written by men, its teach- ings were not binding.22 He taught the "God-concept" to his daughter, and she credited him with converting her] from a belief in God as a being, anthropomorphic or attributeless, into a belief in God as a process. God is a thinking process. Every individual is born with a minimum consciousness, or soul, if you will. The growth of the individual increases that consciousness. The same holds true for the world as a whole. . . . God is the thought of the individual and the world. Martha Neumark also paid particular attention to women's spiritual lives. She believed that a woman rabbi's unveiling of her "spiritual struggles" would enlighten the women of the congregation. "[O]ur services have become haunts mostly for women," she argued, and so, with women rabbis leading the congre- gation, "[a]t least, their paths of spiritual storm will coincide more." She knew from her own preaching at summer services just how receptive the women of the congregation could be. That had convinced her that men and women would benefit spiritually from having both a male and a female rabbi as their religious leaders in the synagogue. As Neumark's chapter in the history of women's journey to ordination was closing, another chapter opened at the Jewish Institute of Religion in New York, where Irma Levy Lindheim, an heiress, mother of five, and Zionist, per- suaded the faculty of this new rabbinical seminary to admit her as a candidate for ordination. However, a pilgrimage to Palestine in the midst of her studies 93</page><page sequence="7">Pamela S. Nadell convinced Lindheim of the compelling urgency of Zionist work, leading her to abandon her studies for ordination. Throwing herself into Zionist affairs, she succeeded Henrietta Szold as National President of Hadassah in 1926. Yet, ultimately, American Zionism would not sustain Lindheim. In 1933, at the age of 47, the one-time rabbinical student and ardent Zionist took the road less traveled to her new home in Kibbutz Mishmar Ha'emek.23 Decades later, Lindheim published her autobiography, Parallel Quest: A Search of a Person and a People. Not surprisingly, it, too, can claim a place in the literature of spiritual narrative. Lindheim, who by her own admission was woefully ignorant of much of Jewish life and culture before she began her rabbinical studies, recalled moments of intense religiosity in her youth. Reform temple services were "solemn and beautiful." As "the organ poured forth its wonderful sound" and the choir sang, she was "lifted right up to heaven." Her confirmation, "the tremendous event of [her] youth," resonated with "wonder and joy at the moment when, before the open ark," the rabbi placed his hands on her head and blessed her. At that moment, Lindheim recalled, "To myself I vowed that my life would forever be dedicated to my people."24 Years later, during World War I, a weekend in Baltimore at the home of the ardent Zionist Harry Friedenwald triggered Lindheim's Zionist epiphany. Returning on the train to New York, she recalled her state of mind as "only one oí waiting": I had a misty sense of something coming toward me. . . . Without being able to identify what was happening ... I had the feeling of growing bigger than I knew how to be. ... To what moment can one point, saying, There in that moment my life was mystically changed?. . . What had been coming toward me happened. . . . Zionism reached out to me and took my hand. . . . Mystically, yet it seemed tangibly as sunlight, a great purpose and its glory touched me.25 Later, Lindheim would liken this awakening both to Moses' encounter with the burning bush and to Isaiah being touched by the coal of fire. She had "turned aside from [her] accustomed path, to see, to learn, eventually to become a part of it," just as Moses had turned aside to the see the great wonder of the bush that burned, yet was not consumed. As the angels touched Isaiah's lips with 94</page><page sequence="8">Reading Anew the Pioneers of Women's Ordination a burning coal, her "tongue [was] touched at last with the coal of fire I had dreamed of and prayed for during that mystic period of my confirmation."26 As for God, Lindheim knew that, throughout the course of Jewish his- tory, "the concept of God was subject to interpretation and changes." These interpretations included: the shepherd-God; then the God of vengeance and armed hosts, yielding to the God of the Prophets, who demanded that righteousness flow as a mighty stream, and justice be meted out alike to all men. But if Lindheim dwelled only briefly on the concept of God, she well knew: Where this Kingdom of God was to be was, in the Jews' reasoning and faith, beyond question. ... In prayer, in plans, in dreams throughout the centuries, to the Jew the living reality was his return to the land.27 For this Zionist, holiness resided there. Israel called out to her: "Your roots are here." Zionism answered "her quest for a faith to live by," as she realized: "My people's quest and mine were joined." The land and its people became her "source of strength." Each journey there increased her "faith . . . manifold." She came to feel herself "truly reliving the flight of the Jews from Egypt." In the "luminous night of Palestine's darkness before dawn," from her beloved kibbutz, as Lindheim rose each morning to write, she would go out to her ter- race and gaze at "the world spread out" below. Each day she would come to "relate a little more to all that this world signifies, and to myself; my world now; the land of my people; my home."28 It should not surprise that not only were these three early pioneers of women's rabbinic role spiritually attuned, but that there are commonalities to their experiences that shaped their view of the holy. For at least two of them, the critical importance of early religious figures stands out. Neumark wrote of her father, the professor: "[W]e were also spiritual companions." Lindheim believed she received her "passionate Jewish consciousness" directly from her grandmother, who, as she lay dying when Irma was but five, admonished the child: "Never, never, my darling, forget you are a Jew." Ray Frank did not record her early religious influences, but perhaps her father's proud claim 95</page><page sequence="9">Pamela S. Nadell of descent from Rabbi Elijah ben Solomon, the Gaon of Vilna, hints at the religious environment of a home which equipped her to become a Sabbath school teacher.29 Both Neumark and Lindheim recalled powerful early spiritual moments. Their confirmations30 stirred their desire to serve their people. Lindheim asso- ciated that moment with "an acute regret that I was not a man, and therefore could not become a rabbi." Even earlier experiences of the holy had occurred in the synagogue or in religious school. Frank believed that growing up among non-Jews in Nevada propelled her early Jewish interests, as she grappled at a young age with "the cause and meaning of prejudice against the Jews." Later, she preached frequently about the importance of children's religious experiences.31 All three women found prayer meaningful. For Frank, congregational sing- ing was one path to true worship. Neumark sensed that the Hebrew liturgy and religious ritual made of her prayer true communion. Classic Reform worship resonating with the majesty of an organ and choir were Lindheim's preferred path. What stood out to me as I read their religious reflections is not only how each woman experienced and wrote about prayer, but also that each left a legacy of mystical musings. Ray Frank imagined herself soaring above the world to meet "the Eternal." Neumark sought to nourish her "mystic nature." What can only be called an epiphany brought Lindheim to experience a "conversion" to Zionism.32 Finally, what is particularly striking about the writings of these pioneers in the quest for women's ordination is their attention to what we now call gender, or the social construction of the sexes.33 While these women surely would not, in their time and place, have been able to name this mode of analysis, each saw women as being implicitly different from men. Frank spoke of women's spe- cial tasks as mothers and spiritual guides for their children. Neumark under- stood that the perspective brought by female rabbis, with their particular attun- ement to the "spiritual storms" of the women of the congregation, might add a new dimension to Judaism. Although Lindheim expressed fewer reflections upon gender, both she and the great icon of American Jewish womanhood, Henrietta Szold, intuitively understood that gender affected leadership. As they corresponded about Lindheim's nomination to the Hadassah presidency, Lindheim wrote that, if indeed she were elected to lead this Zionist women's 96</page><page sequence="10">Reading Anew the Pioneers of Women 's Ordination organization, "I shall feel that I have been ordained, more truly so, even, than had I been confirmed as a rabbi." Szold responded that Lindheim's particular "preparation, personality, and convictions" were exactly what the women of Hadassah needed at that moment in time.34 Admittedly, three voices constitute a tiny sample. Yet, they suffice to affirm that the pioneers of women's ordination left a spiritual legacy. Moreover, it is one whose themes unconsciously reverberate in the lives of their heirs, the women who became rabbis. In the summer of 1997, women Reform rabbis commemorated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the ordination of the first female rabbi, Sally Priesand, in a special issue of the CCAR Journal titled Wisdom You Are My Sister. Illuminating the lives, careers, and teachings of the pioneering generation of women rabbis, Wisdom You Are My Sister reveals that their spiri- tual concerns mirror those of the women who would have been rabbis. As they write about "Meaningful Worship- How Do We Get There?"; as they seek out "opportunities for holy connections"; as they express "reaching toward the Divine"; as they yearn for "ceremonies which speak to the soul,"35 they spin a thread across time and space to Ray Frank's search for expressive prayer. In imagining God as "Creator of all / mystery wonder and awe"; in speaking of the "Mystery of God's ways and God's timing," of their "experience of Our Source of Being," or of "the daily miracles that God is working in people's lives,"36 they stand in the shadow of Martha Neumark's mystical search for God. In "thank[ing] God for the women whose arms are linked with our own" and reflecting upon "the special connection that can exist among women,"37 they leap from Irma Lindheim's understanding of women's ways of leading and guiding. The themes of their spirituality- understanding prayer, unveiling the mystical moments of their lives, and displaying sensitivity to gender- link the women who became rabbis to the women who would, if they could, have been rabbis. They reveal that the spiritual concerns voiced by today's women rabbis were once, long ago, also voiced by those who pioneered the question of women's ordination in the history of American Judaism. I wish to thank Vanessa Ochs for an extremely insightful reading of an earlier version of this essay. 97</page><page sequence="11">Pamela S. Nadell Notes 1.
