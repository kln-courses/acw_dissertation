<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS OF AUDEN'S POETRY* By MONROE K. SPEARS SIX major clusters of symbols (certainly, in one sense, myths; but I prefer to avoid that overworked term) re cur centrally throughout Auden's poetry: War, the Quest, Paysage Moralis?, Psychosomatic Disease, ~Evos-A gape-Logos, and the City. These patterns are developments of natural symbols, and are not obscure; their significance, however, be comes apparent only when Auden's work is studied as a whole. For Auden's poems are not windowless monads, but peculiarly interdependent; the full meaning of the individual poem de pends upon its relation to other poems, and its symbolism is often intelligible only in relation to the symbolic pattern of which it forms a part. My purpose in this essay is first to describe in generalized terms these major groups of symbols, with emphasis on the poems of the last decade, and then to illustrate their concrete operation by analyzing in some detail the latest long poem, The Age of Anxiety. Although my in tention is primarily exegetical rather than evaluative, I think that a proper understanding of the symbols disposes of much unfavorable criticism of Auden's poetry, for they have three principal functions: first, the technical function of providing a concrete dramatic situation and a unifying principle of organiza tion for the imagery; second, the satirical function (I have tried to show in another essay that Auden's poetry is essentially satiri cal) of extending satire into the cosmic dimension, and some times of implying a satiric norm; third, the didactic function of *This essay is the second of a two-part series contributed by Dr. Spears to The Sewanee Review.

SPEARS 393 embodying concretely and dramatically concepts of varying de grees of abstraction. I War is the most obvious and most constant symbolic pattern in Auden's poetry. Christopher Isherwood {Lions and Shadows, 1938), Randall Jarrell (The Southern Review, 1941), and others have described the war symbolism of the early poems: the fusion of the saga-world and the schoolboy-world into a world of conflict between a nebulously-conceived "We" and "They," dominated by obscure feuds, practical jokes, dark threats conveyed in puns and riddles and understatements. By the characters of the Icelandic sagas, as by schoolboys, war is regarded as man's natural and normal condition, peace as an accidental breathing space. Auden has continued to use these images, merging them with other war-images from diverse times and places, in representing the real wars of our age; the effect is to suggest that all wars are ultimately the same, and that they are no more than an intensification of man's perennial situation of insecurity and danger, that they make us aware of the true human predicament. A frequent corollary symbol is that of the Border, the Frontier between two hostile states. In this territory the soldier is singled out for an individual doom, called upon to risk or sacrifice himself (e.g., "The Secret Agent," CP, p. 29; 1928;1 "Missing," CP, p. 43; 1930); or the comfortable bourgeois is suddenly confronted by the responsi bility of choice, the surfaces of his civilized world parting to reveal conflict in which he must take sides (e.g., "The Wit nesses," CP, p. 185; 1933). In these early poems there is a strong Marxist element: the conflict is both class war and international war as a symptom of 1I refer to Collected Poems (Random House, 1945)?abbreviated CP?for all poems contained therein, quoting earlier volumes only for poems not reprinted in CP. After each reference I give the date of the first publication I have been able to discover.</page><page sequence="3">394 THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS decaying capitalism, and Auden portrays satirically the ambiva lent attitude of the doomed middle class, driven subconsciously by the death-wish and the evolutionary urge toward their own extinction, yet resisting consciously. But the War is too gen eralized and too nebulous to fit Marxist terms, and the ultimate reference is psychological and internal. The Enemy, as Auden sees it, is always self-created, is always the result of our spir itual failures (e.g., "Which Side Am I Supposed To Be On?" CP, p. 136; 1932). Similarly, in his later poetry Auden inter prets the real wars of our time in psychological terms, as pro ceeding ultimately from our metaphysical and religious deficien cies: these "Nightmares that are intentional and real" arise from our sense of guilt; the Unconscious has its revenge ("Crisis," CP, p. 169; written September, 1939; "In War Time," CP, p. 3; 1945). The development of the Border image has paralleled that of the War symbolism generally, from the partly-political reference of the early verse toward a more com pletely psychological reference. The bourgeois intellectual, un able to escape his class and so cross the sociological frontier, or to escape his time and cross the chronological frontier (when, through processes as inexorable as evolution, the bourgeoisie will have disappeared), becomes Everyman, prevented by cau tion, by timid respectability, from confronting a choice no longer political or biological, but the ultimate religious choice between Eros and Agape. Such recent poems as "Under Which Lyre" (Harper's, June 1947) illustrate this concept, as well as the persistence of the war symbolism and the plainness of its psychological reference. II Except in the early verse, War usually forms a background, a situation, in which the major symbols operate. The Quest pattern often develops out of the Border symbol: the individual is singled out, for reasons beyond his comprehension, for a ter</page><page sequence="4">MONROE K. SPEARS 395 rifying responsibility; he is required to leave his comfortable everyday life and undertake a mysterious Quest (e.g., "Some thing Is Bound To Happen," CP, p. 34; 1932). In the early poems, this pattern has no very definite conceptual meaning. The individual chosen has no special qualifications, is not a Hero; no distinction between the Average and the Exceptional is implied. The imagery is that of the childhood world of the fairy-tale Quest, where the unprepossessing hero or third son saves the princess or finds the sacred object; but this fairy-tale world is usually parodied or reversed (e.g., "Happy Ending," CP, p. 125; 1930; "Adolescence," CP, p. 24; 1932). The question implied?the meaning of Success?is unanswered, ex cept for ridicule of conventional bourgeois concepts. Later poems, however, explore the rich complex of ideas inherent in this symbol. "The Quest" (CP, pp. 251-262; 1941) is Auden's fullest treatment. In this sonnet sequence (which has, I think, been much under-rated), the Quest is interpreted mainly in terms of Freudian psychology. "The Door" of the first sonnet is the threshold between the Conscious and the Unconscious mind? "Out of it steps the future of the poor"?and the theme is, roughly, that most of our troubles, political and personal, stem from the Unconscious. The theme is made explicit in the second sonnet: "In theory they were sound on Expectation/Had there been situations to be in;/Unluckily they were their situation. . ." This Freudian analysis is combined with a semi-religious con trast between self-love and unselfish love (in this context, so cial consciousness^ altruism); thus "The City" and the three succeeding sonnets describe the temptations?all ending in ego ism, isolation?which seduce exceptional individuals from the Quest. The next group presents the theme of the Exceptional vs. the Average; the Freudian interpretation of genius as com pensation for maladjustment or physical defects is put explicitly. 3</page><page sequence="5">396 THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS "The Tower" (exceptional achievement) is "an architecture for the odd"; the danger is that it may become an ivory tower of isolation, since the genius is tempted to avoid commitment to belief; "Those who see all" may "become invisible," the ma gician may be caught in. his own spell (i.e., become insane). "The Presumptuous" describes average, well-adjusted people who, not noticing that the virgin is ugly, the hero had a "pe culiar boyhood," presumptuously "set forth alone/On what, for them, was not compulsory," and either fail or abandon the Quest. In the next, an Average man, driven by his parents' egoistic illusion that he is Exceptional, undertakes the Quest: "He saw the shadow of an Average Man/Attempting the Ex ceptional, and ran." "Vocation," a variation on the same theme, presents a situation reminiscent of Kafka: the bureaucratic of ficial rejects the application of the individual to suffer (i.e., be exceptional); forced to become a tempter instead of a martyr, he ends as a worldly ironist. Conversely, in "The Useful," those who succumb to temptations become instruments to aid others on the Quest. "The Way" is especially interesting as a contrast to Auden's later religious views (e.g. the Kierke gaardian concept of the Wholly Other); parodying the Fairy tale and Grail Quests, it observes that the Way to salvation in them "is got/By observing oneself and then just inserting a Not" (the piece has an unmistakable Ogden Nash quality). "The Lucky" considers the question of Chance, Destiny, or, in religious terms, Grace; the failure wonders: " 'Was I doomed in any case,/Or would I not have failed had I believed in Grace?'" "The Hero," in the next, is unchanged externally by his success, his only apparent difference from the Average his remarkable humility. In this, as in the preceding sonnet, Auden is evidently on the verge of a religious point of view; a slight shift of perspective would make this hero Kierkegaard's Knight of Faith. The following sonnets, however, show how</page><page sequence="6">MONROE K. SPEARS 397 far he still is from complete acceptance of Christianity. "The Adventurers" describes the desert saints, the mystics who go "the Negative Way toward the Dry"; as in Auden's earlier poetry, mystics are presented as daredevils (e.g., the Dancer's flight "from the alone to the Alone" in The Dance of Death, 1933). "The Waters" deals with human longing for belief, love of illusion, the implication being that the saints of the preceding poem cling to "rafts of frail assumption." The last sonnet, "The Garden," describes the condition of Innocence, escape from guilt, which, no matter what the apparent object of the Quest, is always its ultimate end; before it, real or illus ory, the great blushed "And felt their center of volition shifted." In recent years Auden has written a number of prose analyses of the various types of Quests and Heroes, taken as indexes to the political, moral, and religious presuppositions of the cul tures they represent. Thus in "K's Quest" {The Kafka Prob lem, ed. Angel Flores, 1946) he classifies Quests as the Fairy Tale, Quest for the Grail, Dream Quest (e.g., Dante), Pil grim's Progress, Quest for Necessity (e.g., Faust or Peer Gynt), Quest for Innocence, and Kafka Quest; another essay ("The Guilty Vicarage," Harper's, May 1948) discusses the detective story in terms of the Quest for Innocence. In the introduction to The Portable Greek Reader (1948) he formulates the types of Heroes as Homeric, Tragic, Erotic (Don Juan-Tristan), Contemplative, and Comic; in The Enchaj?d Flood (1950) he uses the Kierkegaardian division into Aesthetic, Ethical, and Religious (with its inversion, Negative Religious) Heroes. The curious fact is, however, that?though there is usually a close parallelism between Auden's poetry and his prose discussions? these concepts with which he has been so much preoccupied have found little direct expression in his poetry. The explanation, possibly, is the shift in perspective caused by his commitment to Christianity. For, as Simeon says in For the Time Being</page><page sequence="7">398 THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS (1944), Christianity negates the distinction between the Ex ceptional and the Average: The tragic conflict of Virtue with Necessity is no longer confined to the P^xceptional Hero; for disaster is not the impact of a curse upon a few great families, but issues con tinually from the hubris of every tainted will. Every in valid is Roland defending the narrow pass against hope less odds, every stenographer Brunnhilde refusing to re nounce her lover's ring which came into existence through the renunciation of love. Nor is the Ridiculous a species any longer of the Ugly; for since of themselves all men are without merit, all are ironically assisted to their comic bewilderment by the Grace of God. Every Cabinet Minister is the wood cutter's simple-minded son. . . . Nor is there any situation which is essentially more or less interesting than an other. . . . (CP, pp. 452-3) This religious perspective confirms the social analysis which led Auden to conclude that the atomism of modern society has made every man the isolated individual responsible alone for his destiny, made the Kafka hero universal; the machine has compelled all to the admission that Aloneness is man's real condition, That each must travel forth alone In search of the Essential Stone, Each salesman now is the polite Adventurer, the landless knight GAWAINE?QUIXOTE_(CP, p. 311; "New Year Letter," 1940) Returning thus to the position implied in his early poems?that there is no distinction between the Exceptional and the Aver age?Auden tends now to use the Quest symbolism only inci</page><page sequence="8">MONROE K. SPEARS 399 dentally, or as a background for other symbols; The Age of Anxiety, however, as we shall see, is based upon this pattern. Ill Paysage Moralis? (it might also be called Psychic Geography and Geology) is one of Auden's most distinctive types of sym bolism. The technique is derived, at least in part, from Rilke: Auden observes in a review that Rilke had the first fresh solu tion since the Seventeenth Century to the problem of expressing abstract ideas in concrete terms. Rilke's method, he says, is the opposite of the Elizabethans' (anthropomorphic identifica tion); but like them, and unlike the Metaphysicals, who used intellectual ingenuity, wit), Rilke thinks in physical rather than intellectual terms. "While Shakespeare, for example, thought of the non-human world in terms of the human, Rilke thinks of the human in terms of the non-human, of what he calls Things (Dinge)." "Thus one of Rilke's more characteristic devices is the expression of human life in terms of landscape." (New Republic, 1939, p. 135) Since Auden has no interest in external nature for its own sake, virtually all his landscapes are moralized; for him, as for Rilke, the distinction between the inner and outer worlds is tenuous and interp?n?tration is constant. The landscape of the early poems is well known: rusting machinery and abandoned mines suggest the decay of capitalism; an effect of ominousness is produced by representing (as in Surrealist painting) the fa miliar detail incongruously isolated; the d?bris of the glaciers, with the threat of a new Ice Age, suggests social changes as in evitable as biological ones. Though the reference here is partly political, it becomes more purely psychological in the later poems. In them, two types of moralized landscape may be distinguished. The first consists in developing and particulariz ing the natural symbolism in which landscape represents emo</page><page sequence="9">400 THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS tional states or situations. The fine sestina, "Paysage Moralis?" (CP, p. 47; 1936), in which the City stands for civilization, society; the Mountain for action, decision; the Island for es cape, isolation; Water for belief, potentiality; the Valley for passiveness, innocence, is a good example of this type. Moun tains, because of their association with frontiers, appear with particular frequency in Auden; they suggest responsibility for decision, fear, difficult action and achievement (the Border Situ ation). The last sonnet of In Time of War (1939), "Wander ing lost upon the mountains of our choice," is a highly successful use of this symbol. Mountains here represent the human situ ation, intensified in our time: though we dream of innocence, in which desire and duty are one; though we take refuge in an illusory past or uncertain future, and long for authority and certainty; we must live in the strenuous present, making our difficult choices in dreadful freedom, striving for truth in spite of our imperfections. The surface reference here is topical and political?democracy vs. totalitarianism?but the theme is very close to Auden's later Christian version of "redeem the time," In "New Year Letter" there is a long passage describing hu man nature in terms of English landscape: I see the nature of my kind As a locality I love Those limestone moors that stretch from BROUGH To HEXHAM and the ROMAN WALL, There is my symbol of us all. (CP, p. 298) Towns, shops, localities symbolize shoddy thinking, denial of reason or heart, sloth; myth and art are "enormous cones"; "turning states to strata," he sees how "basalt long oppressed broke out/In wild revolt . . .," the derelict mill is "lost belief," with its chimney pointing a question. Mines are associated with a childhood psychological experience (presumably, in Freudian terms, the emergence of the Superego): they made him aware</page><page sequence="10">MONROE K. SPEARS 401 of "Self and Not-self, Death and Dread," of "The deep Ur mutterfurcht that drives/Us into knowledge all our lives," and of guilt (p. 299). The same limestone symbol is the basis of a recent poem, "In Praise of Limestone" (Horizon, July, 1948). "If it form the one landscape that we the inconstant ones/Are consistently homesick for, this is chiefly/Because it dis solves in water." The "best and worst" seek other soils: gran ite, completely unresponsive, attracts future saints; clay and gravel, completely responsive, attract secular saviors, "intendant Caesars"; the oceanic solitudes attract the "really reckless." The limestone landscape, varied, responsive but unpredictable, repre sents human nature as seen by the child innocently dominated by Eros; more important, it symbolizes the weakness, the indi viduality, of ordinary human nature. It is "not the sweet home that it looks/Nor its peace the historical calm of a site/Where something was settled once and for all"; yet it "calls into ques tion/All the Great Powers assume"; this weakness, this indi viduality, challenges the secular saviors, protects man from the extremists ; in religious terms, it is the ultimate basis of humility and faith. It is only in terms of this landscape, the poet says, that he can imagine "a faultless love/Or the life to come." The other type of moralized landscape employed by Auden consists of symbolizing an individual's mind, his character and beliefs, and sometimes his body, through landscape. "There are two atlases," he says in New Year Letter; one is public, The other is the inner space Of private ownership, the place That each of us is forced to own, Like his own life from which it's grown, The landscape of his will and need Where he is sovereign indeed, The state created by his acts. . . . (CP, pp. 296-7) And he describes the "map of all my youth" in Letters from</page><page sequence="11">402 THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS Iceland (1937), with its "mental mountains and the psychic creeks/The towns of which the master never speaks." Matthew Arnold (CP, p. 54; 1940) is "a dark disordered city"; Lear (CP, p. 77; 1940) "became a land" to which children swarmed like settlers. At Yeats's death, the "provinces of his body re volted,/The squares of his mind were empty,/Silence invaded the suburbs,/The current of his feeling failed" (CP, p. 49; 1940). Later in the poem, the technique is generalized: poetry "survives/In the valley of its saying ... it flows south/From ranches of isolation and the busy griefs/Raw towns that we be lieve and die in"; it is used climactically at the end: "the seas of pity lie/Locked and frozen in each eye," and the poet prays, "With the farming of a verse/Make a vineyard of the curse/ . . . In the deserts of the heart/Let the healing fountain start. . . ." This type of landscape symbolism plays a major part in The Age of Anxiety, to be considered later. IV Auden's use of physical disease to symbolize mental or spir itual disorders is so obvious and well known that it requires little discussion here. According to Isherwood, the doctrine that dis ease is invariably teleological, a mode of expression of the Id, caused by a sense of guilt, was an important part of the psycho analytical philosophy taught Auden in Berlin by John Layard, a disciple of the "healer" Homer Lane, and deriving ultimately from Groddeck and Freud. Auden describes it in Letters from Iceland: "Part came from Lane, and part from D. H. Law rence;/Gide, though I didn't know it then, gave part./They taught me to express my deep abhorrence/If I caught anyone preferring Art/To Life and Love and being Pure-in-Heart/.. . . The Pure-in-Heart is never ill. . . ." While Auden has long since rejected the philosophy taught by "loony Layard," he has never ceased to give some degree of literal credence to the</page><page sequence="12">MONROE K. SPEARS 403 doctrine that organic disease has a psychic origin, that "the true significance of a neurosis is teleological ... a neurosis is a guardian angel; to become ill is to take vows." (New Republic, 1941, p. 186) The concept appears constantly, though usually incidentally, in his poetry; regardless of its truth?and psycho somatic medicine appears to be gaining more and more official recognition?it has excellent poetic results, rendering abstrac tions vividly and concretely. As I have pointed out in my first essay, Auden conceives of poetry as essentially therapeutic, and of the poet as the spiritual diagnostician. Like the psychoanalyst, he strives to overcome "resistance," bring to consciousness repressed thoughts and ac tions, hidden motives. Art is the Mirror which confronts men with the intolerable image of themselves as they really are; ex posing complacency and self-deception, it compels awareness of man's true condition. Poetry accomplishes its therapy through revealing the source of social disorders in individual disorders, of physical disorders in spiritual. The ultimate spiritual dis order thus disclosed is always, in Auden, a defect of Love. V Auden's concept of Love (usually embodied in the three symbols Eros, Agape, Logos) has changed, but never his con viction that Love is the only matter of final importance. Eros, in the early verse, is conceived in psychoanalytical terms; as in Freud (see his Outline of Psychoanalysis, N. Y., 1949, pp. 20 24) it includes both ego- and object-love, the urge to self-preser vation and preservation of the species, as well as sexual love; it wars against, and sometimes combines with, the other basic drive, the destructive or Death instinct. The Freudian concept is interpreted according to the Lane-Layard anarchistic teaching already mentioned: "The disease of the soul is the belief in moral control: the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil,</page><page sequence="13">404 THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS as against the Tree of Life"; "There is only one sin: disobedi ence to the inner law of our own nature" (Isherwood, Lions and Shadozvs, pp. 299-301). Eros is therefore good, and the "pure in heart" obey Eros. The perversions of Eros are the main theme of the early poems, portraying satirically "England, this country of ours where nobody is well." "They" are invalids in bath-chairs, with Oedipus complexes, incapable even of sexual love, "self-regarders," dominated by the Death instinct. Aside from the tenuous Marxist analysis, the trouble is that "They" are not "pure in heart," do not obey Eros. Only by reversing Their instructions can We find "the home of love" ("Have a Good Time," CP, p. 155; 1932). On this Island (1937; pub. in England as Look, Stranger! 1936) presents somewhat different concepts. The theme that our troubles, public and private, result from a failure of love, that the problem is to unlearn hatred and learn love, is ex pressed in virtually every poem. But this love is not the Eros of the earlier poems: "O for doors to be open and an invite with gilded edges" (CP, p. 219) shows the hatred, envy, and self-love of the natural man; "In Father's Footsteps" (CP, p. 95) contrasts the "intricate ways of guilt" in human love with animal innocence. Sexual love is an illusory "whisper in the double bed," an island, an isolated, selfish escape. The fine poem, "Through the Looking-Glass" (CP, p. 113) is a re nunciation of Eros: "Gone from the map the shore where child hood played,/Tight-fisted as a peasant, eating love;/Lost in my wake the archipelago,/Islands of self through which I sailed all day." Christmas challenges these "shifts of Love," and in contrast the poet hopes to celebrate the "birth of natural order and true love." Generally, however, the unselfish love contrasted with Eros and set forth as an ideal is secular rather than distinctively Christian; it produces social consciousness,</page><page sequence="14">MONROE K. SPEARS 405 aims at the "really better world," to be achieved through po litical action. Auden's complete and final commitment to Christianity ap parently took place in 1940.2 The poems of the years im mediately preceding this acceptance?those collected in Another Time, 1940, and The Double Man, 1941?reveal his ideas about Love, as about everything else, in a transitional stage. His position during this period may be called Humanism, his gods being the great poets, philosophers, musicians: Vowing to redeem the state, Now let every girl and boy To the heaven of the Great All their prayers and praises lift ("Epithalamion," dated Nov. 23, 1939; CP, p. 174) Mozart, Goethe, Blake, Tolstoi, Hoelderlin, Wagner, "Look ing down upon us, all/Wish us joy." Many poems celebrate these secular gods?Yeats, Freud, Voltaire, Matthew Arnold, Lear, Pascal, Montaigne, Rimbaud, Melville, Luther?a tend ency reaching its height in "New Year Letter." As in this poem, his ideas during the period are often semi-Christian, but stop short of commitment; they are not consistent, since they end in the conviction that secular humanism, even embodying eclectically religious concepts, is inadequate. In most of these poems, Auden carries further the tendency seen m On this Island to reverse the "pure in heart" concept in 2Neither "New Year Letter" (dated January i, 1940) nor "Spring, 1940" is dis tinctively Christian; "Autumn, 1940" and "Christmas, 1940" definitely are, and so are all the succeeding poems dealing with religious concepts. I am aware of the hazards of inferring a poet's beliefs from his poetry?no one puts them better than Auden, who observes that the poet "does not have to believe what he says, only entertain it as a possibility: e.g., if he writes a poem about the Crucifixion, there is no means of knowing from the poem whether he believes in it as a Christian must believe or is using it as a convenient myth for organizing the emotions his poem expresses, for in poetry dogma and myth are identical" (Partisan Review, Feb., 1950). Certainly Auden entertained Christianity as a possibility in many poems before he fully believed it, but the permanent change in attitude seems rather clearly marked, and the evidence of Auden's reviews supports my conjecture about rhe date.</page><page sequence="15">406 THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS the direction of orthodoxy; nobody is pure in heart, because the law of our own nature is corrupt; Eros, being selfish, tends toward evil. The windiest militant trash Important Persons shout Is not so crude as our wish: What mad Nijinsky wrote About Diaghilev Is true of the normal heart; For the error bred in the bone Of each woman and each man Craves what it cannot have, Not universal love But to be loved alone ("September 1, 1939," CP, p. 57) Even the Just are composed "Of Eros and of dust." "Eros Paidagogos/Weeps on his virginal bed" because "he is Eros and must hate what most he loves;/And she is of Nature; Na ture/Can only love herself" ("Oxford," CP, p. 80; 1940); "The Capital" is a "restaurant where the lovers eat each other" (CP, p. 100; 1940). More corrupt than the animals, man's "lust in action to destroy" is "the refined/Creation of machines and mind" ("New Year Letter," CP, p. 295). As Auden moves closer to Christianity, the other two mem bers of his symbolic trilogy make their first serious appearance: Agape (selfless Christian love, Divine as opposed to human) and Logos (the Incarnate Word; Eternity as opposed to Time; Law; Authority). Since Auden during this period is entertain ing various ideas as possibilities, however, the concepts sym bolized, and the relations between the symbols, are inconsistent and shifting. Thus there is frequently a contrast between selfish and unselfish love, foreshadowing the later clear distinction be tween Eros and Agape-, Melville, arriving at Agape, compares himself with Hawthorne:</page><page sequence="16">MONROE K. SPEARS 407 ??Nathaniel had been shy because his love was selfish? But now he [Melville] cried in exultation and surrender "The Godhead is broken like bread. We are the pieces" (CP, p. 147; 1940) But the elegy on Freud celebrates the Freudian Eros, in terms of Auden's earlier concepts; Freud "showed us what evil is: not as we thought/Deeds that must be punished, but our lack of faith,/Our dishonest mood of denial,/The concupiscence of the oppressor"; at his death, "Sad is Eros, builder of cities." (CP, p. 166; 1940) "Heavy Date" (CP, p. 105; 1940) medi tates on the strange mutations of Love, which "like Matter is much/Odder than we thought"; it is "a way of living," and through it "we discover/An essential secret/Called by some Salvation/And by some Success"; it is based on mutual need: "I believed for years that/Love was the conjunction/Of two oppositions;/That was all untrue." But, though moving hesi tantly toward Agape, this Love is still Eros: "Bless you, dar ling, I have/Found myself in you." "New Year Letter" simi larly hesitates between Agape and Eros: "We need to love all since we are/Each a unique particular/ . . . We can love each because we know/All, all of us, that this is so" (CP, p. 314). In a biological metaphor, the mutation of Eros by Logos is described: "The rays of Logos take effect,/But not as theory would expect,/For, sterile and diseased by doubt,/The dwarf mutations are thrown out/From Eros' weaving centrosome" (CP, p. 288). But, against these Christian passages, there are others where Eros is presented favorably; it is desirable that we should "fulfill/Eros's legislative will," thus giving effect to "love's volition" (p. 305); the trouble is that instead we are dominated by the Ego, self-love. In contrast, Auden later concludes that the political myth of Eros is the source of most of our troubles; similarly, the theme (as in "Crisis," CP, p. 170; 1939) that our political difficulties are the revenge of the</page><page sequence="17">408 THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS Unconscious for our sense of guilt and failure of love shifts later to the conviction that Faith alone, not better psychology, can set our love in order. "Kairos and Logos" (CP, p. 11; 1939) is a thoroughly Christian meditation on the significance of the Incarnation. Logos here connotes the Eternal, the time less world of objective law and logic; Kairos the right point of time, the particular moment, the subjective world of the in dividual. Dreading death, obsessed by time, the Roman em pire is dominated by "vast self-love"; Christ is "predestined love" which fell "like a daring meteor into time," bringing "cer tainty of love." Hence Christians do not condemn the world or hate time, but pray, in a favorite phrase of Auden's, "O Thou who lovest, set its love in order."8 In contrast, "Law Like I,ove" (CP, p. 74; 1940) explores the relations of Eros and Logos, Logos having here primarily the secular connotation of Law, society's restrictions upon the anarchic impulses of Eros. Men of various types and professions think that Law is what affects them or what they know, but they all disagree or are partial; the poet, claiming no special knowledge, says timidly that Law is "Like Love." Though this love is clearly Eros, not Agape, the poem expresses xAuden's perduring conviction that Love is the ultimate principle of explanation and that there is no secular basis for Law. Many other poems, foreshadowing the later Christian meditations on Time, consider the relation of Time (usually in the aspect of Eros) and Eternity (the Logos): thus "Our Bias" (CP, p. 118; 1940) describes the human obsession with Time instead of "going straight to where we are"; "As I walked out one evening" (CP, p. 197; 1940) presents, in the clocks' reply to the lover, the theme that Time 8See the note on 1.56 of "New Year Letter," The Double Man, p. 76. My com ment is certainly not intended as a full discussion of these four complex sestinas, I wish to make a general apology here for the inadequate treatment of individual poems and the simplified, perhaps arbitary paraphrasing of symbolism?by definition multivalent?throughout this essay. Hoping that some conciseness and clarity would be gained in compensation, I have avoided qualification and apology.</page><page sequence="18">MONROE K. SPEARS 409 conquers human love, and concludes: "You shall love your crooked neighbor/With your crooked heart." Discussing Auden's religion in my earlier essay, I have men tioned the obvious influences of Kierkegaard and Reinhold Nie buhr. His distinctively Christian concepts of Eros, Agape, and Logos evidently were influenced also by Denis de Rougemont's I^ove in the Western World and Charles Cochrane's Christianity and Classical Culture. (In reviews written during this period of spiritual clarification, 1940-1, Auden sometimes indulges in the excesses common to recent converts?e.g., reproaching Nie buhr for not being "sufficiently ashamed," believing sufficiently in the contemplative life?and frequently writes passages closely parallel, or even verbally identical, to his verse of the same time. He has been sufficiently criticized, by Jarrell and others, on both grounds.) Reviewing De Rougemont (Nation, 1941), he states the book's thesis that, historically and metaphysically, the concept of romantic love is based upon Manicheism, holding Matter and Time to be evil, denying the flesh and the present, and seeking its perfection in death, when matter and time are transcended and the soul merges into the Logos. The great exemplar is Wagner's Tristan. This myth creates its negative mirror image; in Mozart's Don Giovanni, the flesh and the present are asserted, the spirit and the future denied; time is something to be aggressively destroyed. Opposed to both iso topes of Eros is the Christian concept of Agape-, based on the Incarnation, it denies neither flesh nor spirit, and permits us to love human beings as individuals; to love God is to obey God, who commanded us to love one another. De Rougemont is wrong, Auden says, in defining Eros as of sexual origin; Eros rather is the basic will to self-actualization without which no creature can exist (we have seen this concept in Auden's early poetry); Agape is Eros mutated by Grace, a conversion, not an addition; -its symbol is not sex but eating, an act testifying to</page><page sequence="19">410 THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS the dependence of all creatures on each other. The myth of romantic love is a false solution to the problem of enabling Eros to choose truly, an attempt to eliminate the possibility of wrong decisions through making one myth discharge the func tions of religious faith, tradition, and other beliefs that once governed the conduct of life. It is only in the past hundred years that people have seri ously tried to marry their mater-imagos or their lame shadows, and it is only quite recently that, dismayed at the failure of this attempt, they have denied the significance of personal relations altogether and returned to a collec tive and political myth of Eros. Reviewing Cochrane's book in New Republic, 1944, Auden remarks that he has read it many times since its appearance in 1940. Summarizing Cochrane, Auden remarks upon the in ability of classical thought to give positive value to freedom, to avoid the dualism of God and the World, Mind and Matter,. Time and Eternity. Identifying the divine with the necessary or the legal, classical idealism cannot oppose tyranny on prin ciple, cannot give meaning to individuality. As Augustine showed, only Christianity can make sense of man's private and social experience, the central doctrine being that of the Trinity, formulation of the belief that God is love?not Eros, the de sire to possess something one lacks, but Agape, a reciprocal re lation, dynamic free expression. If men love themselves, their society is an earthly city in which order is maintained by force; if they love God and their neighbors as themselves, a heavenly city in which order appears the natural consequence of freedom (i.e., through Agape, Eros and Logos are one). Like Niebuhr and other neo-orthodox theologians, Cochrane thus shows the deficiencies of secular ethical and political thought, and the relevance of Christian dogma to these problems; his influence</page><page sequence="20">MONROE K. SPEARS 411 upon Auden is evident not only in the concept of the Logos but in the symbol of the City, to be discussed presently. After Auden's commitment to Christianity, the old perplexi ties are resolved, and the symbols gain new distinctness and sig nificance. "Autumn 1940" (CP, p. 101) is the first clear ex pression. The Ego, returning to the world of time after sleep, finds the present age particularly discouraging; the poet asks: Will the inflamed ego attempt as before To migrate again to her family place, To the hanging gardens of Eros And the moons of his magical summer? The political myth of Eros is seductive; the prospects of any thing else, any real change of heart, are dim: "few have seen Jesus and so many/Judas the Abyss." We do not understand the Logos: "who can/Tell what logic must and must not leave to fate,/Or what laws we are permitted to obey?" Predatory glaciers threaten; there seems little hope; we can only do "formal contrition/For whatever is going to happen." Auden closes with a deeply-felt prayer (his most Eliotian passage, perhaps indicating some influence at this time of Eliot on his religious views) in praise of the Logos. "Christmas 1940" (CP, p. 118) describes similarly the temptation to despair pro duced by our present predicament. The poet sketches the course of life on this planet leading to the right point of time (the "Kairos" of other poems) when "Flesh grew weaker, stronger grew the Word,/Until on earth the Great Exchange occurred." From that center of history, we have reversed the old equations, are returning to the "universe of pure exten sion"; now we are "reduced to our true nakedness" and con fronted by an inescapable choice: "Either we serve the Uncon ditional/Or some Hitlerian monster will supply/An iron con vention to do evil by." Only the vision of "that holy centre," 4</page><page sequence="21">412 THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS the Incarnation, can reconcile our rival errors, show how "The rich need not confound the Persons, nor/The Substance be di vided by the poor." "It is the vision that objectifies," and only Christianity can resolve our difficulties, "only Love has weight" in this "modern void"; but though only Agape can save us, it is an end, not a means. "In Sickness and in Health" (CP, p. 29; 1945) is a good example of Auden's mature use of these symbols. Describing the dearth and perversion of love in our time, the poem shows how Eros produces its two isotopes, Tristan and Don Juan; "Nature by nature in unnature ends." Through the romantic myth we arrive at the political myth of Eros, and at war: The lovers of themselves collect, And Eros is politically adored: New Machiavellis flying through the air Express a metaphysical despair, Murder their last voluptuous sensation, All passion in one passionate negation. Our loves are selfish, "we are always in the wrong/Handling so clumsily our stupid lives"; yet Divine Love, though it ap pears to us as the Absurd, exists and works through us. We must "pray/That Love, to Whom necessity is play,/Do what we must yet cannot do alone" and the poet prays that Agape, manifested in the Logos, enable us (through Grace) to avoid the perversions of love, preserve us "from presumption and de lay," and, paradoxically, "hold us to the voluntary way." For the Time Being (1944) employs the three symbols extensively. Eros, denying Agape, caused the Fall: Eve, "in love with her own will,/Denied the will of Love and fell" (CP, p. 419), and the conflict between Eros and Agape is put in historical terms: "the course of History is predictable in the degree to which all men love themselves, and spontaneous in the degree to which each man loves God and through Him his neighbour"</page><page sequence="22">MONROE K. SPEARS 413 (p. 452). Only the Incarnation explains the relations of Time and Eternity, Necessity ("our freedom to be tempted") and Freedom ("our necessity to have faith"); only the Agape thus embodied unites Eros and Logos. The metaphysical signifi cance of the Incarnation as explained in the doctrine of the Trinity is described by Simeon: Because in Him the Word is united to the Flesh with out loss of perfection, Reason is redeemed from incestuous fixation on her own Logic, for the One and the Many are simultaneously revealed as real. So that we may no longer, with the Barbarians, deny the Unity, asserting that there are as many gods as there are creatures, nor, with the philosophers, deny the Multiplicity, asserting that God is One who has no need of friends and is indifferent to a World of Time and Quantity and Horror which He did not create, nor, with Israel, may we limit the co-in herence of the One and the Many to a special case. . . . (p. 453) The title indicates a central theme, one frequent in Auden's later poetry. To live in the present, "the Time Being to redeem/ From insignificance," to refrain from seeking escape from guilt in the past or future or some great suffering, and instead to seek Agape in the everyday world, is most difficult; "The Time Being is, in a sense, the most trying time of all." (p. 465) VI The dominant symbol in most of Auden's shorter poems since 1945 has been the City. Signifying civilization, man's social achievement, the City has always been a feature of Auden's moralized landscape. The special connotation given it in the recent poems is closely related to the symbols just discussed: the contrast of Eros and Agape and the meditations on the Logos lead naturally into a contrast of the earthly and</page><page sequence="23">414 THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS heavenly cities, secular and Christian societies. Though Auden's city symbol is universalized, the central imagery is usually that of ancient Rome and of the present; for the state of our own civilization constitutes an inevitable parallel with that of col lapsing Rome, both naturalistic cultures rejecting in the name of Reason the Absurd of Christianity which alone can give meaning to history as well as to individual life. Thus "The Fall of Rome" (Nation, June 1947) portrays our own bank rupt secularism in terms of that of decadent Rome. The rein deer at the end form an effective but elusive symbol: Altogether elsewhere, vast Herds of reindeer move across Miles and miles of golden moss, Silently and very fast. They suggest the "Wholly Other" realm of religion which man has left out of account, and also the purity of uncorrupted nature in contrast to what man has made of his world. "Under Sirius" (Horizon, October 1949) presents Fortunatus in Rome in the dog-days of history, uncertain what to wish for. He hopes for a Revelation, but his wish is ambivalent; perhaps he is part of the rotten fruit that must be shaken, not one of the reborn, but one of "those who refused their chance" and to whom the dull dog-days of secularism will seem in retrospect "golden with self-praise." He is, in short, the disillusioned naturalist, longing for yet fearing the supernatural, and Every man reluctant to confront ultimate issues. The notion of a secular Hero who will save the City and perfect humanity has always seemed funny to Auden, as in Ode IV of The Orators, "Danse Macabre" (CP, p. 59; 1937), "Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone" (CP, p. 228; 1936), "Epitaph on a Tyrant" (CP, p. 99; 1940). His recent attitude is obviously influenced by Cochrane's analysis of the philosophi</page><page sequence="24">MONROE K. SPEARS 415 cal defects of classical idealism which lead it always to impose order by coercion and to end in tyranny: The history of Graeco-Roman Christianity resolves it self largely into a criticism of that undertaking [i.e., Au gustus's] and of the ideas upon which it rested; viz. that it was possible to attain a goal of permanent security, peace and freedom through political action, especially through submission to the Virtue and fortune' of a politi cal leader. This notion the Christians denounced with uni form vigour and consistency. {Christianity and Classical Culture, pp. v-vi) For Auden, the Secular Savior, the False Messiah, is of course dominated by Eros; his difficulties, and especially his death, indicate the limitations of political action. "The Managers" (Horizon, November 1948) contrasts our present secular sa viors with those of the "bad old days": ours are managers, overworked, depersonalized bureaucrats, without glamor, he roics, or obvious pleasures?"Honours/Are not so physical or jolly now." But, though they think themselves altruists, dedi cated to Service, they are motivated by Eros ("The fact of belonging/To the very select indeed") and deserve no pity: "No; no one is really sorry for their/Heavy gait and careworn/Look, nor would they thank you if you said you were." "Song" (ibid.) uses the Roman imagery again: the admiral and the am bassador have seen their plans come to nothing, as always, but politics and war are not everything; the ultimate joy and sor row of the individual (here represented by the pair of lovers) are beyond the power of the "great" ("Nothing your strength, your skill, could do/Can alter their embrace/Or dispersuade the Furies. . ."). "Under Which Lyre" (Harper's, June 1947; read at Harvard, June, 1946) elaborates the contrast between the Managers, the reasonable, respectable Apollonians who govern the world, believing in salvation through politics;</page><page sequence="25">416 THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS and the Hermetics, the unpredictable recalcitrant individuals for whom secularism can never satisfactorily account nor provide. "If he would leave the self alone,/Apollo's welcome to the throne," but the Apollonians aim at complete control even of education and art (through official art, or magic); the poet therefore advises the individual to remain nonconformist, to refuse to bow down before the secular political god and, trust ing in God and aware of the true ultimate issues, to take short views. Auden's most elaborate use of the City symbol is "Memorial for the City" (Horizon, November 1949). The first section contrasts the naturalistic and Christian attitudes toward history and time. The world as it appears to animals or cameras is the naturalistic world of the Greeks where Time is the enemy and human events are without significance; only Nature "is seriously there" because she endures. But human beings, even "now, in this night/Among the ruins of the Postvergilian City/ Where our past is a chaos of graves and the barbed wire stretches ahead/Into our future till it is lost to sight," know, because of the Christian Revelation, that the "crime of life is not time," that our actions have significance, that we are not to pity ourselves or to despair. The second section describes man's attempts to build a City, a true society. The Middle Ages achieved the Sane City, but it became corrupt; Luther de nounced it as the Sinful City, pointed out "a grinning gap/No rite could cross" (i.e., between the human and the Divine), and the City became insecure and divided. In the Renaissance "poets acclaimed the raging herod of the will"; while Art triumphed, glorifying man, the City was sundered by reason and treason. Later, Reason and Science (based upon the false belief that Nature "had no soul") brought civility and prosperity; the French Revolution aimed at the Rational City, based on natural goodness, seeking the prelapsarian man. In spite of all dis</page><page sequence="26">MONROE K. SPEARS 417 asters, the same goal of the Glittering and Conscious City has been pursued ever since. The third section returns to the pres ent: the end result of this secular progress is the "abolished City," in which civilization has broken down completely, leav ing the barbed wire and ruins of war. The ultimate cause is that this secular ideal, ignoring religious faith, falsifies human nature, "the flesh we are but never would believe." Yet we must not despair, must hope that "the wire and the ruins are not the end"; "There is Adam, waiting for his City." The last section, "Let His Weakness Speak," personifies human weakness (timidity, gregariousness, stupidity, "common sense," "realism"). This weakness, the despair of logicians and states men, is the irreducible core of individuality which protects man while it infuriates the social planners, the Apollonians ("As for Metropolis, that once-great city; her delusions are not mine"). The basis of humility, it is the reason man is no worse than he is, the one ground for hope (A very similar theme is developed in "In Praise of Limestone," discussed above.). VII The Age of Anxiety (1947) was received rather coolly by the critics, most of whom thought it too artificial and rhetori cal, lacking in dramatic quality?all the characters aspects of Auden, saying the same thing?and, as a war poem or a tract for the times, unrealistic and superficial. The poem moves cen trally, however, through the symbolic patterns I have outlined, and I think that an analysis of the symbolism constitutes an adequate answer to these criticisms. The poem is a sympathetic satire on the attempts of human beings to escape, through their own efforts, the anxiety of our age. The anxiety with which the poem deals is, in Auden's view, felt by all men in all times, but intensified in our civili zation with its failure of tradition and belief, its atomism which</page><page sequence="27">418 THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS leaves the individual isolated, without aid or support in his terrifying responsibility for his own destiny. This condition is further heightened in wartime, when "everybody is reduced to the anxious status of a shady character or a displaced person, when even the most prudent become worshippers of chance." The scene is a bar, which offers "an unprejudiced space in which nothing particular ever happens, and a choice of physiological aids to the imagination whereby each may appropriate it for his or her private world of repentant felicitous forms, heavy ex pensive objects or avenging flames and floods. . . ." The time is All Hallows Eve, and the characters are, metaphorically, souls in purgatory, each dreaming in his own way of escape, but aware (except for Malin) of no recourse beyond the human level ; the poem deals with the imaginary worlds they create and through which they reveal themselves. But the poem is mock heroic: this space in which time is unreal is a parody of the re ligious "moment out of time," as their alcoholically-induced visions are parodies of religious visions. The genre is the Dream Quest, in which Everyman seeks spiritual knowledge; in the sevenfold divisions (but ages and stages instead of sins) and the vision of Innocence (Dante's Earthly Paradise, Canto 28) there is a generalized parallel with Dante's Purgatorio. This, however, is "negative knowledge"; the piece is also mock pastoral ("baroque eclogue") because it is a Quest for Innocence, but the guilt and anxiety from which the characters imagine escape through a variously-attained Innocence can be overcome only by Faith. Their myth is of childhood or a happy pre lapsarian place where Eros is unconfined because Logos is un known; but only Christian Agape can make Eros and Logos one, Love become Law; only trust in God can enable man to take short views and redeem the time. The four characters are sharply distinguished, not only ex ternally but in character and point of view; each bears a differ</page><page sequence="28">MONROE K. SPEARS 419 ent relation to the main symbolic patterns of the poem and each moves through his own private world of symbols. The paral lels and contrasts among them are contrapuntal in abundance and intricacy. Malin, the Canadian airman and Medical In telligence officer, is apparently to some extent a spokesman for the poet; he disclaims having faith (pp. 135-6) but, though explicitly so only in the last section, his viewpoint is distinctively Christian. He functions as guide and commentator, as norm (one who, though lacking perfect faith, is at least aware of the true problem) to which the others are contrasted. Rosetta, the Jewish department-store buyer, has achieved material success, but her race makes her a special case of homelessness and spir itual insecurity; she moves through a dream-world dominated by the Innocent Landscape of the detective story, upon which reality intrudes in images of isolation and persecution. Since she is the only one who changes, discarding her illusory and ac cepting her real English childhood with all its implications, she is, in a sense, the protagonist. Quant, the aging Irish widower, is outwardly a failure, his intelligence much superior to his po sition as clerk; he denies, humorously or bitterly, any meaning in life, and his typical imagery is that of classical mythology. Perhaps he represents Kierkegaard's "despair of weakness." Emble, the handsome young American sailor, is insecure youth seeking a vocation, success; his images are of the Quest, the sea (potentiality, belief), mountains (difficult action, choice). Physically he is exceptional, the potential Aesthetic Hero, but unable to find a Quest; in contrast, Quant is no hero, Malin the potential Ethical Hero (i.e., possessing superior knowledge, but not absolutely committed as is the Religious Hero). At the beginning of the poem, the characters are introduced in their private reveries, each a variation on the central theme of guilt and innocence. A newscast recalls them to the present, and the War symbolism becomes dominant, emphasizing the</page><page sequence="29">420 THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS elaborate "mask" of the poem. The alliterative meter and the characteristic rhetorical devices (periphrasis, metonymy, litotes, prolepsis) suggest the mood of medieval Anglo-Saxon and Ice landic poetry, accepting war as man's natural condition and fac ing it with Stoic courage and resignation. Its effect is to take away the specificity of World War II by merging it with all wars, to extend the situation from the topical and contemporary to the universal. Unable to agree on the significance of the war (their interpretations reveal their philosophies)4, the characters agree to discuss, not the past or future, but the "incessant Now of/The traveller through time." Malin states the subject: man's perennial attempt to become reconciled to himself, to escape guilt, anxiety and dread. Part II, "The Seven Ages," puts Shakespeare's seven ages into psychological terms; it is based on the concepts of Eros, Logos, and, by negative implication, Agape. Every infant re peats the Fall: "that ban tempts him;/He jumps and is judged: he joins mankind,/The fallen families, freedom lost,/Love be come Law." Eros and Logos henceforth conflict; the will is corrupt. In the Second Age, realizing he "has laid his life-bet with a lying self/Who wins or welches," the child becomes self conscious and divided, lives isolated in dreams and self-pitying fantasies. In the Third Age, "learning to love, at length he is taught/To know he does not"; sexual love, being still Nar cissism, ends in disillusion: Quant's surrealist description of the sightseeing voyage to Venus Island puts this vividly. The Fourth Age presents Everyman emerging from the domination of Eros (abandoning his fantasies of being Exceptional, loved for himself alone) into the real world of "theology and horses." Rosetta, persisting in her regression, protests, "Too soon we 4Emble justifies the war in simple and popular terms: Rome fell through soft ness, "Better this than barbarian misrule"; Malin replies that the new barbarian was born here, inside the City, and we share the blame ("A crime has occurred, accusing all"); Quant sees no meaning beyond a temporary "defense of friends against foes' hate"; Rosetta thinks the war will change nothing, its end will see a return to the "lies and lethargies" of peace.</page><page sequence="30">MONROE K. SPEARS 421 embrace that/Impermanent appetitive flux . . . which adults fear/Is real and right"; Emble remarks that this "real" world is full of perversions of Eros: "a dean sits/Making bedroom eyes at a beef steak/As wholly oral as the avid creatures/Of the celibate sea," financiers lust for money, while average married people, losing interest in sex, long for change, the Absolute In stant. Quant replies that the Unexpected is always present, any stability illusory: "We are mocked by unmeaning." In the Fifth Age, Malin goes on, he obtains worldly approval, success. Emble fears that he will never obtain this; Quant describes failure to obtain it; Rosetta argues that success is meaningless in our time, and Quant replies that all times are the same, history has no meaning. The Sixth Age shows Every man aging, unhappy, longing for the innocence of childhood. Again, each character interprets in his own terms: Quant por trays the aging failure, who has abandoned the Quest after one glimpse of the "glaciers guarding the Good Place," returning conscious of his own evil; Rosetta describes the innocent dolls running down, the paternal landscape fading, the illusion lost; Emble describes the vanished garden (innocence), the desert (isolation in modern society) which must be home. In the Sev enth Age, Everyman's "last illusions have lost patience/With the human enterprise," and at death he "is modest at last." Ironically, each character then returns to his illusions, unaffected by the analysis: Rosetta thinks of the deaths of lovable eccen trics in her Innocent Landscape; Emble compares himself with the Average?"Must I end like that?"?Quant, describing odd deaths, takes refuge in humor and cynicism. Part III, "The Seven Stages," is based on the pattern of the Quest; it is not, however, the journey homeward to the center of time, the Quiet Kingdom, but the "Regressive road to Grand mother's House": i.e., a parody-Quest for an unrecoverable In nocence consisting in being non-human like a doll, or ignorant</page><page sequence="31">422 THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS of the Logos like a child. Since they seek "that state of pre historic happiness which, by human beings, can only be imagined in terms of a landscape bearing a symbolic resemblance to the human body," the landscape is all moralized. Because the complex symbolism of each Stage is interpreted differently, in an intricate counterpointing, by each character, an adequate com mentary on this section would run to inordinate length; I can therefore give only a simplified outline. Isolated at the begin ning, each character finds enough water (belief, hope) to moti vate his Quest. Climbing the mountains (action, choice) they arrive at a watershed in the "high heartland" (in terms of the body, the heart as seat of the will and emotions). Thence they proceed on the Second Stage to the maritime plains, where each reacts characteristically: Rosetta sees the ports as disorderly; Emble in military terms; Malin sees in the ocean a metaphysi cal and religious "border," and Quant is overwhelmed by its immensity (the desperate spirit is "a speck drowning/In those wanton mansions where the whales take/Their huge fruitions.") The Third Stage takes them inland to the Metropolis (civiliza tion; in terms of the body, the brain), on which they comment in the Fourth Stage. The City is a "facetious culture," out wardly planned and orderly, but ignoring ultimate questions; the planners have taken care of everything but the anxiety and evil of individuals. In the Big House, the Fifth Stage, Ro setta finds only her imaginary childhood environment turned sour, its innocence corrupted, "mating and malice of men and beasts." As they race away, each makes a typical comment: Malin fears that failure will indicate sin; Quant believes the average is safest; Emble rejoices in his superiority but tries to look modest; Rosetta says, "I can't hope to be first/So let me be last." The Graveyard represents the end of secular planning for the individual, the fact it omits. The Sixth Stage takes them to the Hermetic Gardens (in the symbolic body, the</page><page sequence="32">MONROE K. SPEARS 423 genitals); on the journey each feels sexual attraction. The implication is that sexual love is Narcissistic, the object self created (Auden's most famous version of this theme is the dummy-undressing scene in The Dog Beneath the Skin), for Malin's impulse is really to create a son in his own image, Quant's to create a daughter-wife. The beauty of the gardens, recalling their sins of love, afflicts them with psychosomatic disease, and the Seventh Stage takes them alone into the forest, despairing of love. At the edge they encounter the Desert, "lands beyond love," i.e., the place of trial; confronted by this, all feel self-doubt. Thus they refuse to attempt the only true Quest, to become aware of the religious Choice; and "their fears are confirmed, their hopes denied. For the world from which their journey has been one long flight rises up before them now. . . ." All feel guilt and see visions of terror; then they return to themselves and the present. Part IV, "The Dirge," is dominated by the City symbol. Discouraged by the apparent meaninglessness of Nature and the hopeless situation of man, they think of some "semi-divine stranger with superhuman powers, some Gilgamesh or Napoleon, some Solon or Sherlock Holmes" who promises to rescue man and nature, but who always dies or disappears. This is, of course, the False Messiah, the Secular Savior to whom, without Christianity, mankind will always look for relief from anxiety and guilt.. But this dirge is a parody; the Lawgiver they ironically lament is the Hero of all Quests, the Lucky Son, the Grail Knight, Caesar and the dictator?the universal Excep tional Man in whom the Average, escaping responsibility, put their faith. In psychological terms, he is the Father-imago, "Our lost dad,/Our colossal father." The characters, however, cannot take this solution seriously. Part V, "The Masque," resumes the Quest pattern: the theme now is sexual love, the Erotic Quest of Emble and Ro</page><page sequence="33">424 THE DOMINANT SYMBOLS setta, perennial Prince and Princess. Auden comments that in wartime "even the crudest kind of positive affection between persons seems extraordinarily beautiful, a noble symbol of the peace and forgiveness of which the whole world stands so desperately in need." So Malin invokes "Heavenly Venus" as a quasi-Platonic symbol of universal love, in contrast to Quant's previous bitter picture of Venus Island. Emble woos in his characteristic Quest images; Rosetta replies in her Inno cent Landscape. Though aware that sexual love is regressive, Narcissistic, Malin and Quant tolerantly urge them to cherish their illusions. The Vision of Innocence they all participate in is the crowning illusion, the climax of the whole poem as parody Dream Quest: each describes in his own terms the triumph of Eros and Innocence (the false goal they pursue throughout the poem). But all the illusions fail, Emble passes out, and Ro setta renounces her dream of "the Innocent Place where/His Law can't look," of "a home like theirs." Abandoning her Innocent Landscape, she accepts her real childhood ("the semi detached/Brick villa in Laburnum Crescent,/The poky par lor. . . ."), her "poor fat father," and the fact of her race which he symbolizes: "Time is our trade, to be tense our gift/ Whose woe is our weight; for we are His Chosen." For her there is no escape from evil, insecurity, the hard fate of her race; accepting these realities, she concludes by reciting the Jewish Creed in Hebrew. Part VI, "Epilogue," consists of Malin's meditations on the nature of Love and Time (the first time in the poem that the Christian concepts of Agape and Logos have been introduced), counterpointed by Quant's meditations on the Heraclitan flux of Time and the meaningless cycles of history: there is always a war and a peace-treaty, bringing hopes for a better world which are always doomed to disappointment. Malin reflects that we do not learn from the past, that the future looks bleak:</page><page sequence="34">MONROE K. SPEARS 425 Yet the noble despair of the poets Is nothing of the sort; it is silly To refuse the tasks of time And, overlooking our lives, Cry?cMiserable wicked me, How interesting I am.' We would rather be ruined than changed, We would rather die in our dread Than climb the cross of the moment And let our illusions die. (p. 134) But after this passage?which, if any, is the "message" of the poem?he returns to his negative knowledge: we cannot under stand the relation between Time and Eternity, the "clock we are bound to obey/And the miracle we must not despair of"; we cannot conceive of Agape, how the "raging lion is to lime/ With the yearning unicorn." Neither Reason nor Imagination can enable us to comprehend these matters; the meaning is "reserved/For the eyes of faith to find," and our own efforts, without Grace, cannot achieve faith. Eros is corrupt; our pas sions pray to "primitive totems"; science or no science, our dreams are of "Bacchus or the Great Boyg or Baal-Peor,/For tune's Ferris-wheel or the physical sound/Of our own names"; our worship is mostly "so much galimatias to get out of/Know ing our neighbor." Thus "in choosing how many/And how much they will love, our minds insist on/Their own disorder as their own punishment." Yet "His love observes/His appall ing promise," and Divine Grace, Agape, is vouchsafed us, "His Good ingressant on our gross occasions," in our "mad unbelief" as we "wait unawares for His World to come."5 6The recent poems cited in this essay as appearing in various periodicals are all included in Auden's new volume, Nones (Random House), which was published after this essay had been set up in type.</page></plain_text>
