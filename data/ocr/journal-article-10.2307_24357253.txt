Neither the apeiron of Anaximander, nor the apeiros aer of Anaximenes per sists as a circumambient of the world after cosmogony by generation out of or condensation and rarefaction of part of these archai. After cosmogony the world is coterminous with the original, spherical nass of the arche in its pre-parturition or pre-process state. In the formed world the space not occupied by a birth-pro duct or densification-rarefaction-product of the arche is occupied by part of the Urstoff in its original state. It is thus, as an internal environment of the differentiated world bodies, that the arche is a periechon. A breathing world is not Anaximenean. Apeiron does not mean «infinitely extended" in the earliest pre-socratics, but untraversably large. Thus it is applied to the sea in Homer. The Anaximandrian apeiron is best represented as space, not as a kenonvoid, but an uncharacterised matrix (without even the darkness of Hesiod's void) of the world bodies. In a sense Anaximander demythologises Hesiod. As in the Theogony, the apeiron spawns, but its products are not divinities with anthropomorphic attributes, but «activity-things", the hot, cold, wet, dry, etc., which interact by virtue of powers (dynameis). Anaximenes is more sophisticated still. The arche no longer spawns, or generates, but is involved in a purely mechanical process. The products of rarefaction and condensation are not so much powers, and thus still redolent of animism, as elements. They act not according to an anthropomorphic prin ciple of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, but re-act in conformity with physical law. The only animistic taint in Anaximenes' system is the motion of the aer which allows cosmogony to begin at a certain point of time. The offending detail was seized upon by Parmenides. p. J.
