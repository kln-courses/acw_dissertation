<plain_text><page sequence="1">BÉNÉDICTE BOISSERON After Jacques Derrida (More to Follow): From A-cat-emic to Caliban I often ask myself, just to see, who I am - and who I am (following) at the moment when, caught naked, in silence, by the gaze of an animal, for example, the eyes of a cat, I have trouble, yes, a bad time overcom- ing my embarrassment. - Jacques Derrida, The Animal That Therefore I Am Can the animal respond? asks Jacques Derrida. Can the subaltern speak? asks Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. Together, the two questions draw an analogy between Animal Studies and Postcolonial Studies, fields that came to life when the silent one started to talk, or rather, when the invisible one was finally seen seeing. As Derrida says in The Animal That Therefore I Am : "to see and. to be seen through the eyes of the other,"1 the "other" being the cat staring at his naked body in the bathroom. Postcolonial Studies, starting with the Negri- tude of Aimé Césaire, Léon-Gontran Damas, and Léopold Sédar Sen- ghor, introduced western consciousness to the experience of being seen by the other. "Here are black men standing, looking at us, and I hope that you - like me - will feel the shock of being seen,"2 Jean- Paul Sartre writes in his introduction to the nègre (as in Negritude) voice. But more than merely being seen, it would be more accurate to say that Animal and (Post)-Colonial Studies are located in the fragile instance right before self-consciousness, in the fraction of a moment when the naked one is about to realize that he or she is being looked at by the silent one. "I am seen and seen naked, before even seeing myself seen by a cat."3 This article will focus on the prescience of the gaze forcing one to look up in order to respond to the silent stare. 1.

On the one hand, the article will ad- dress the question at the heart of Colonial and Postcolonial Studies, namely how to name the one that we do not know. This question runs, in Animal Studies, from J.M. Coetzee to Derrida ( animot ); and in Postcolonial Studies, from the nègre to Christopher Columbus's cannibal. On the other, this article will focus on the very nature of the academic lecture. It will argue that, when Derrida delivers a lec- ture about the anguish of seeing his cat seeing him naked, the guest speaker is indirectly addressing, incidentally, his own nakedness in front of the staring audience. Therefore, this article will also be, and first of all, about the prescience of the audience's stare on the speaker who has to talk about the animal, a living entity that he does not re- ally know. In sum, it is about the predicament of having to talk about what one does not know. When J. M. Coetzee was invited to deliver a series of lectures on ethics for the Princeton's Tanner Lectures in 1997, the South African writer chose to give a fictional presentation on animal rights, a short story entitled The Lives of Animals. Rather than following the con- ventional format of the academic lecture, Coetzee ventured into the hybrid world of scholarly fiction writing. In a mise en abyme tech- nique, Coetzee's lecture told of the protagonist Elizabeth Costello delivering a lecture on animal rights to an audience of college profes- sors. Adding to the embedded pattern, Costello addressed in her lec- ture a short story by Franz Kafka, "A Report to an Academy," about a human-like ape (Red Peter) presenting to the Academy of Science the story of his anthropomorphic transformation. Coetzee, like Costello and Kafka, is a writer, not a scholar or specialist of Animal Studies, which makes it challenging for all three to talk about animal philoso- phy. As it were, Coetzee was able simultaneously to establish and dis- claim his author-ity by repeating seemingly ad infinitum the theme of the non-scholar addressing an audience of scholars on the question of animals, "I am not a Kafka scholar,' Costello says, 'In fact I am not a scholar at all,"'4 - just like Coetzee who, despite his lack of - so to speak - credentials, delivered an academic lecture on animal ethics. First comes the lecture, then the audience's response and along with it, the anguish of having to respond to the response. Coetzee pre- sumably sought to circumvent the usual protocol by hiding his voice, 4. J.M. Coetzee, The Lives of Animals (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1999), 27.</page><page sequence="3">BÉNÉDICTE BOISSERON 97 and hence his author-ity, behind heteroglossic chatters. Because Costello is not perceived - to quote Mikhail Bakhtin - as "an object of authorial discourse, but rather a fully valid, autonomous carrier of [her] own individual world/'5 Coetzee's protagonist can make claims of her own, independently from the author. But the problem is how to respond to a character's claims that are precisely unclaimed by the author. This question sums up the situation of the philosopher Peter Singer, as he tries to respond to Coetzee's lecture. As Singer admits in his response to Coetzee's lecture, "I don't know how to go about responding to his so-called lecture."6 Singer chooses to speak through the voice of a fictional alter ego, which is his own way of circumvent- ing the challenge of responding to Coetzee's lecture.7 Singer's response to Coetzee invites us to ponder the role of the response in an academic lecture. Coetzee uses a smoke and mirrors strategy in order to avoid answering for - as in répondre de (being ac- countable for) - his claims. In a further attempt to highjack the sec- ond step of the lecture (the response), Coetzee includes, in his own lecture, the reactions of Costello's audience as well as her Q &amp; A session. In so doing, Coetzee instigates in his audience a vicarious im- pression of having already responded to his lecture, thus preventing the real audience from having to respond. Yet, the response is always infallible, as Singer's response shows. No matter how inhospitable the lecture may be, the response never fails,- it always already follows the lecture. The book The Lives of Animals is a collection of essays from the Tanner Lectures that includes not only Coetzee's lecture, but also the responses to his lecture by four scholars (Marjorie Garber, Peter Singer, Wendy Doniger, and Barbara Smuts). The structure of the book attests to the impendingness of the response since after the lecture inevitably come the responses. The Lives of Animals (first the lecture, then the responses) serves as a reminder that, in spite of all, Coetzee must own up to his words,- meaning, he must - as the French puts it - répondre de ses actions . Coetzee is compelled to respond 5. Mikhail Bakhtin, Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1984), 5. 6. Coetzee, The Lives of Animals, 91. 7. Singer chooses to follow Coetzee's postmodern technique through a fictional dialogue between his daughter and himself discussing how to respond to Coetzee's lec- ture. The daughter has been invited to offer a response to Coetzee's lecture in Prince- ton. Singer suggests she respond with a fictional piece, which he is himself precisely writing.</page><page sequence="4">98 Yale French Studies to ( répondre de /own up to) his words, even if it means répondre de the impossibility of responding to his lecture. In this regard, Coet- zee's lecture is not only an exercise in showing the infallibleness of répondre de academically, but also of the intrinsic act of répondre à , in the sense of following after and mostly abiding by . Costello fol- lows after, takes after, Kafka's "Report to an Academy." The embed- ded pattern in Coetzee's lecture, however, exceeds what meets the eye. Presenting itself as an always already response to a previous lec- ture, Coetzee invites his followers to follow the trace of his itinerary, which leads us inevitably to Jacques Derrida. There are only a few months separating Derrida's July 1997 lec- ture in Cerisy (France) from Coetzee's October 1997 lecture at Prince- ton University, yet Coetzee's The Lives of Animals comes across as a cross-Atlantic follow-up to Derrida's The Animal That Therefore I Am. Probably unbeknownst to him, Coetzee is made to take after Derrida, in the literal sense of following right after Derrida. At the chateau of Cerisy-la-Salle, Derrida presented a ten-hour lecture, the theme of which was "The Autobiographical Animal." The introduc- tion to the lecture, which would be the only piece included in the con- ference proceedings, was later published under the title "The Animal That Therefore I Am (More to Follow)." "More to Follow [à suivre ]" indicated Derrida's intention to publish other parts of his lecture at a later date. In 2003, he fulfilled his promise by publishing another piece from his lecture, "And Say the Animal Responded?" But " More to Follow" does not only offer a promise to publish more pieces from the lecture, it also invites a follow-up. Coetzee soon enough heard the invitation and followed after him. But in addition, "More to Follow [à suivre ]" is meant to engage the audience to follow Derrida, "to fol- low' in the sense of understanding and following his train of thought, his lecture being a suite requiring some following: If I am following this suite [si je suis cette suite], and everything in what I am about to say will lead to the question of what "to follow" or "to pursue" means, as well as "to be after," back to the question of what I do when "I am" or "I follow," when I say "Je suis," if I am (following) this suite then, I move from "the ends of man," that is the confines of man, to "the crossing of borders" between man and animal.8 8. Derrida, The Animal That Therefore I Am, 3.</page><page sequence="5">BÉNÉDICTE BOISSERON 99 The English translation of L'animal que donc je suis by David Wills contributes to Derrida's text an even more ventriloquistic complex- ity. Given Derrida's ample use of homonyms, Derrida's language can only be partially translated; as such it always retains a polyglossic nature populated with markers of restance : Qui suis-jel Or Que suis-jet Who or what am I (following)? Hence- forth it is disturbed by an ambiguity that remains, within it, untrans- latable, in what remains small, the small, the small word falling in the middle of this three- word interrogative proposition, namely, the little homonym suis [. . . .].9 Lawrence Venuti, in The Translator's Invisibility , indicates that non- transparent translations are based on a so-called "foreignizing method." Translators who observe this method "register the lin- guistic and cultural difference of the foreign text, sending the reader abroad."10 Following Venuti's logic, we can say that, for the sake of ac- curacy, in his English translation, Wills is compelled to keep Derrida's French text "foreign." Derrida's text is like an animal that leaves a track for the others to follow. Like a pack animal or a horde, Derrida's writing is inherently multiple. His voice is, to paraphrase Gilles De- leuze and Félix Guattari [A Thousand Plateaus ), "molecular" because diffractive, polysémie, and polyglottic. But what about the animals? "The animal, what a word!"11 Der- rida says. And indeed, it is all about the word, animot, the mot animé that the followers animate, bring back to life as they follow the suite and repeat it in their own variation. Derrida's lecture presents itself as a dare to whoever follow his animal scent. Derrida carried the habit of writing down his lectures verbatim before delivering them. The transcription of what he is about to say pinpoints again, in a sort of inverted sequence of events, the iterable nature of Derrida's lectures. First comes the written word that will be then delivered orally, which can be seen as an expression of self -reflexive ventriloquizing. Once the words reach us, in their published version of "L'animal que done je suis (à suivre)" and even more so in their English translation "The Animal That Therefore I Am (More to Follow)," Derrida's lecture has 9.

Here is the true anguish: the fear of silence or of the reckoning, the moment when one will have ťo respond after everything has been said. As previously mentioned, Derrida presented his lecture "The Ani- mal That Therefore I Am" (which includes the introduction "The An- imal That Therefore I Am (More to Follow)") at a Cerisy conference in July 1997. Coetzee follows closely Derrida, but not only chrono- logically. Beyond the obvious question of animals and the common year in which the two lectures were delivered, what essentially brings Coetzee and Derrida's lectures together is the fear of the response. This fear is the punctum, as Roland Barthes names it in Camera Lu- cida, the thing that speaks to you, the relatable experience that is so familiar and yet never explicitly voiced. "Everything that I am about to entrust to you no doubt comes back to asking you to respond to me,"15 Derrida tells his audience at Cerisy. It is a plea for a response that also translates the anguish of répondre de, to be accountable for the words delivered in his lecture. "I no longer know how to respond, or even to respond to the question that compels me or asks me who I am (following) or after whom I am (following) [. . .]."16 In the preface to The Animal That Therefore I Am, the editor Marie-Louise Mal- 12. As Matthew Calarco indicates, in "Tracking the Animal in Derrida," his book review of The Animal That Therefore I Am, Derrida wanted to, and started to, alter his text before considering it for publication. He only published two parts of his lec- ture, "The Animal That Therefore I Am (More to Follow)" and "Say the Animal Re- sponded." The remaining chapters were published posthumously. 13.

Ibid.</page><page sequence="7">BÉNÉDICTE BOISSERON 101 let addresses Derrida's profound anguish, which she sees as an anxi- ety caused by time elapsing, again the idea of reckoning [échéance]. Mallet notices a leitmotif around time, or the lack thereof, in the transcription of Derrida's lecture, leading her to conclude that Der- rida was extremely concerned about what she calls "the tolling of a bell."17 Given Derrida's motifs in his entire body of work based on the question of delaying ( diffézance , iterability, restance, to name a few), Derrida's fear of reckoning ( échéance ) comes as no surprise. Derrida's lecture itself, as an initially written text, is a plea for a suite against a flnitude, a plea for something that will carry on his words in spite of their oral evanescence. In Limited Inc., Derrida writes: A written sign, in the current meaning of this word, is a mark that subsists, one which does not exhaust itself in the moment of its in- scription and which can give rise to an iteration in the absence and beyond the presence of the empirically determined subject who, in a given context, has emitted or produced it. This is what has enabled us, at least traditionally, to distinguish a "written" from an "oral" communication. 18 Derrida's written lecture as something that "subsists" and "does not exhaust itself" helps understand the anguish mentioned by Mallet. As the editor explains, the anxiety that she detects in Derrida's lec- ture about the time elapsing includes the obvious, namely "the end of a colloquium, the little time remaining in fact, the fear, also, of tak- ing up too much time and attention on the part of an audience that, nevertheless, was asking for nothing else."19 But there is something more in Derrida's anguish. "Jacques Derrida's readers and friends will recognize there an anxiety, an anguish, a 'trembling' of the voice that they have often heard [. . .]" Mallet says, "his thinking always forged ahead toward an uncertain future to come, in the first instance through this concern for 'doing justice' to the text."20 In other words, Mallet convincingly argues that Derrida's anguish comes from the fear of not owning up to his words, of the inability to répondre de ses mots. But what if the "trembling of the voice" did not only reflect a concern for doing "justice to the text" but also for the simple and 17. Ibid., xii. 18. Derrida, Limited Inc.

Ibid.</page><page sequence="8">102 Yale French Studies commonly shared anguish of standing alone, naked, with a text in one's hands? What if in Derrida's The Animal That Therefore I Am, the silent cat looking at Derrida's naked body were a modest detour, on Derrida's part, to address the real anguish: the silent audience fac- ing him in his "haunted castle"?21 Even more to the point, what if The Animal That Therefore I Am were, in truth, about a naked Der- rida standing in front of a silent audience not responding since, in a lecture, the response always follows {"suivre") and never is ["être")2. As Mallet says in her preface, "the conference continued with the other programmed lectures, but participants were expecting more: the question of the animal in Heidegger, which had been pointed to many times during the lecture, remained in abeyance. On the last day, therefore, July 20, at the end of the proceedings, Derrida agreed to improvise a response to that expectation."22 The last day, at the last moment, Derrida had to répondre de ses mots, and follow up on his Heidegger promise. In spite of his insistence on not being the last to speak - "don't think for a moment that I am insisting on having the last word [. . .] be really the last to speak"23 - Derrida has to keep speaking, forever catching up on a failed promise. As we tease out the polysemy in his neologism animalséance referring to the discomfort of a naked Derrida in the presence of his staring cat, we see that the animal is not the cat but Derrida, the only one truly à poil (meaning in French both "furry" and "naked"). "Nudity gets stripped to bare necessity only in that frontal exhibi- tion, in that face-to-face,"25 Derrida argues, the frontal exhibition be- ing also the nature of the academic lecture. The guest speaker is in malséance, he is the only one animé (animated) in a room filled with static listeners. Derrida is, most of all, the animal traqué, tracked down like a deer caught in the headlights of the audience's silent stare. "An animal looks at me,"26 the speaker says, as he looks at himself being looked at by the silent audience. Derrida presents a new geme of academics, the a-cat-emic, the academic animal feeling the anguish of the reckoning, the moment when the lecture comes to a close and it is time to répondre de (be accountable for his words) 21. Ibid., 23. 22. Ibid., xi. 23. Ibid., 141. 24. Ibid., 4. 25. Ibid., 11. 26. Ibid., 6.</page><page sequence="9">BÉNÉDICTE BOISSERON 103 and répondre à (answering to) the audience. The a-cat-emic reminds us of Rodney Wainwright, David Lodge's character in Small World, an Australian academic who, having only written the introductory pages of his paper, dreads the moment when he will reach the end of his unfinished paper, when he will have to face the failed expectations of the audience. "Animals are my concern,"27 Derrida asserts. Indeed, the real question raised in The Animal that Therefore I Am is: est-ce que V animal le regarde ? (is the animal looking at him) - in the polysémie sense of looking at him and concerning him. But equally, the under- lying question is: est-ce que le public le regarde7, (is the audience looking at him) - in the dual sense of looking at him, and should this gaze concern him. This brings us back to Coetzee's embedded theme of the non-scholar addressing an audience of scholars on the question of animals. Kafka, Costello, Coetzee, and Derrida, none of them are scholars of animal ethics; they all are in the situation of asking themselves if the animal les regarde - concerns them. Does the animal question fit their competence since they have never be- fore presented anything, explicitly, on the animal question? Coetzee tries to avoid answering the question by, again, having the fictional audience answer it for him. After her philosophical lecture, 'The Phi- losophers and the Animals," Costello is scheduled to conduct a cre- ative writing seminar entitled "The Poets and the Animals." When Norma, Costello's daughter-in-law, hears that Costello's seminar will address animals in the field of creative writing, she says: "I'm glad it's on something she knows about. I find her philosophizing rather difficult."28 Once again, Coetzee hides behind the veil of vicarious- ness to avoid having to face the audience's dissatisfaction about his unaccredited philosophizing. Derrida, on the other hand, is relentless in proving that animals le regardent, concern him, hence the leit- motif in his work about his long-term interest in animals. "[...] for a very long time, since I began writing, in fact, I believe I have been dedicated to the question of the living and of the living animal. For me that will always have been the most important and decisive question/'29 "They [animals] are the critters [bêtes] that I have been (following) from the start, for decades and from one ten-day confer- 27.

Since when have animals concerned him? As he says above, "for a long time." Andhere, "since so long ago" [depuis le temps]: "Since so long ago, can we say that the animal has been looking at us?"34 In his anguish to do justice to the animal question, Derrida in- vites his audience to track the restance of the animal presence in his body of work, as a way to prove that "for a long time," animals have been his concern. As he says, "Still, short of outlining a philo- sophical autobiography, short of retracing my steps along the paths of philosophy, I could have, or perhaps should have undertaken an anamnesic interpretation of all my animals." Adding promptly, "I won't do that,"35 Derrida indirectly invites his followers to follow up on his aborted intention of tracking the animal traces, dépister la piste (14).36 In Zoographies , Matthew Calarco expresses his surprise at hearing Derrida's claim that animals have been his concern for a long time. The author writes: 30. Ibid., 35. 31. Ibid. 32. Ibid., 37. 33. Derrida, The Beast and the Sovereign Vol. I , trans. Geoffrey Bennington (Chi- cago: The University of Chicago Press, 2008), 36. 34.

Derrida follows here the psychology of the pretense of a pretense, a technique described by Lacan and quoted by Derrida in The Animal That Therefore I Am: "Why tell me that you are going to do X in order to have me believe you are going to do Y, whereas you are indeed going to do X" (128). Derrida says he could retrace his animal presence yet he will not, while indirectly doing it anyway.</page><page sequence="11">BÉNÉDICTE BOISSERON 105 This statement will likely appear odd both to longtime readers of Derrida and to those readers who are familiar with debates in ani- mal philosophy. While Derrida's name and work have, in recent years, been generally aligned with progressive political discourses and move- ments, only rarely has the importance of his thought been recognized for issues concerning animals.37 The double-entendre in regarder, looking/concerning, epitomizes the a-cat-emic anguish of doing justice to the text. Coetzee, Costello, and Derrida are committed to doing justice to the animal question, in spite of their incapacity or their unwillingness to trace back their credentials on the subject. That being said, Derrida is knowingly and purposely a marginal in the field of Animal Studies, his voice being at the limit of this field. As he says, "limitrophy is therefore my subject. Not just because it will concern what sprouts or grows at the limit, around the limit, by maintaining the limit, but also what feeds the limit"38 Derrida's concept of animot is in fact antonymous with the "animal question." In fact, animot is - from Descartes on - what questions the animal question, as it challenges human entitlement to authoritatively name the animal as a non-responsive being. For Derrida, the people who studied and named the animals never thought that those animals could address them. "They have taken no account of the fact that what they call 'animal' could look at them, and address them from down there, from a wholly other origin."39 Derrida's use of the word animot, in that respect, underlines the awareness of the animals' ca- pacity to respond by looking back, by addressing the presumptuous people who have named them. Animot allows Derrida to show that he is on the defensive when it comes to subjectifying the other in the act of naming (animot as a word [mot]). Animot, as in the phonetic plural of animals (animaux), also permits Derrida to insist on the in- commensurability of the animal, animals being a "multiplicity" that cannot be "homogenized"40 into a generic living species. Derrida's cat is the real cat staring at him, not the cat as an empty signifier symbol of the animal species. Animot deals with all those who have studied, 37.

Ibid., 43.</page><page sequence="12">106 Yale French Studies looked at the animal, without seeing that the animal was looking back at them. In that, Derrida follows Sartre. Sartre writes: "For three thousand years, the white man has en- joyed the privilege of seeing without being seen [. . .]. Today, these black men are looking at us, and our gaze comes back to our own eyes."41 What Sartre describes in his 1948 preface to the Negritude anthology42 is comparable to what Derrida will address, close to sixty years later, in his lecture "The Animal That Therefore I Am." In both cases, the philosophers focus on the discomfiture of specularity, the beholder of the initial gaze losing his composure as s/he feels the "shock"43 of being seen, or as Derrida puts it, "a reflex of shame."44 In both cases, the element of unexpectedness is what creates the unease, malséance / animalséance .45 The impertinence of the eyes unexpect- edly meeting is crucial in both Sartre and Derrida. But what makes it even more impertinent is the untimeliness of the experience, given that Derrida and Sartre belatedly become aware of the cat's and the nègre' s already existing stare. They have been caught, initially un- beknownst to them, in their nakedness, literally à poil for Derrida and nakedly white for Sartre - "our white heads are no more than Chinese lanterns swinging in the wind." To add insult to the injury, Sartre says that the nègre shows no interest for the object of his gaze. "A black poet - unconcerned with us - ."46 Le noir ne nous regarde pas , we are not his concern, after all. "Maman, regarde le nègre, j'ai peurl"47 "Mummy, look at the Negro, I'm afraid!," this is how Frantz Fanon in Peau noire, masques blancs, addresses the question of Black interpellation (Althusser). As Fanon explains, the Black man is nega- tively defined through the White gaze, the White gaze being the sov- ereign authority, the one that names and defines the other. But here comes the noirséance, which is as alienating as the animalséance : the White man looks at himself being looked at and sees that his existence is not the Black man's concern, ne le regarde pas, it is an empty stare. 41.

But given that Derrida addressed the animal question at the level of words [mots), as he showed con- cerns for those who name the silent others, the comparison is not only appropriate but also pressing. Hélène Cixous once said, "who- ever cannot hear the cat's speech is just one step from not hearing a woman's speech or a Jew's or an Arab's or that of the subject of one of those species that bear the destiny of banishment."48 What brings Animal and Post colonial Studies together is not so much the "destiny of banishment" as that of being named as an unresponsive entity. The "shock of being seen" described by Sartre is due to the long-lasting expectation that the named one does not talk back, does not respond. "And Say the Animal Responded?" is chapter three of The Animal That Therefore I Am. We find its postcolonial counterpart in The Em- pire Writes Back by Bill Ashcroft, Gareth Griffiths, and Helen Tiffin. The Empire Writes Back, published in 1989, borrowed its title from a 1982 piece by Salman Rushdie from The Times entitled "The Empire Writes Back with a Vengeance." In it, Rushdie posits that the English language needs to be decentered, as "the Empire is striking back."49 Ashcroft's The Empire Writes Back looks at the revisionai methods used by authors from the Commonwealth who aimed at decoloniz- ing the English language. "They [colonized peoples] need [. . .] to es- cape from the implicit body of assumptions to which English was at- tached [. . .]."50 Ashcroft and his co-authors pinpoint the moment when the silent one was finally ready to return the stare, to talk back, and in so doing to strip English of its Western clothes. The word Caliban, almost an anagram of "cannibal," may be the best illustration of what postcolonial revision means in terms of star- ing/striking back. Caliban originally refers to a character, half-human and half-animal,51 in Shakespeare's The Tempest. Prospero occupies 48.

This character has been subject to a series of postcolonial revisions in which Caliban has turned into a rebel and defiant colonized. In Aimé Césaire's A Tempest , one of the most celebrated works of black revision, Caliban asks the colonizer Prospero to call him "X," as not only a reference to Malcolm X, but also to naming as a means of colonial subjection. Ca- liban, as an anagrammatical subversion of cannibal, precisely refers to the colonial institution of naming as empowerment. Both words hark back to Christopher Columbus's 1492 encounter with the Caribbean natives, when Columbus was told that a neighbor tribe was named Caribs . The communication was in translation from the Taino Indian language to Spanish and Columbus misheard the name, thinking the tribe's name was "cannibal." Columbus went back to Europe with the false assumption that the Caribs were named cannibals, and who could have corrected him since, as we know, Columbus was the one responsible in the Americas for naming what the westerner saw as the other? What matters is not what the tribe's name was in reality, but what the colonial decided it was. As George Lamming observes: Columbus's journal speaks about meeting a Caribbean aboriginal on arrival and conversing with him. Yet, as far as I know, Colum- bus spoke not a word of any aboriginal Caribbean language, and the aboriginal spoke neither Italian nor Spanish; it is peculiar that they could understand each other,- what Columbus really did was to create what he ordered, because he represented power."52 Much of the colonial history of the Caribbean can be read through the question of naming as an institution of power. But also, as Celia Britton argues in Edouard Glissant and Postcolonial Theory , the sub- altern sometimes purposely embraces the imposed name and flaunts it back in the Western face as ironical empowerment. This is what, Britton adds, Mireille Rosello calls "mimetic opposition," when for example the Caribbean people take over "the enemy's prejudices and us[e] them for their own ends."53 All this to say that Caliban, half animal and half human, is a postcolonial follow-up (though preceding Shakespeare's Cahban: A Cultural History, in collaboration with Alden T. Vaughan (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993). 52.

Ironically enough, in contrast to what Derrida has claimed, it is not the real cat, the real nègre or the cannibal looking back at us but the name itself with its empty stare no longer concerned by us.</page></plain_text>
