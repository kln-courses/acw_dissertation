<plain_text><page sequence="1">700 ISLE Anthill . By E. O. Wilson. New York: Norton, 2010. 378 pp. Cloth $24.95. Teachers may ask whether E. O. Wilson's Anthill is a new Adventures of Huckleberry Finn for their ecocritical syllabus, updated for the twenty-first century with the ethos, pathos, and logos of a scientist- turned-novelist. An accomplished ecologist and interdisciplinary advocate, Wilson is well known for his theory of island biogeography and for his nonfiction works, Sociobiology (19 75) and Consilience (1998). Anthill's prologue provides an enchanting interscalar vision that equates ants with humans in relation to the biosphere. The novel centers on Alabama's Gulf region, where the young Raff Cody dwells near an endangered stretch of coastal floodplain forest called the Nokobee Tract. In writing fictionalized autobiography, Wilson has poured familiar entities into Anthill's centrifuge: class tensions between poor white folks and the country club set; ethical quandaries regarding the inherent value of an ecosystem and the economic value of its devel- opment; and entomological studies of ant colony and super ant colony. The novel exhibits the challenges of crossing over from science to com- pelling fiction. Whereas effective plots display an economy of detail, Anthill smatters details without discernment, particularly after Raff leaves Alabama for college and law school (at an elite university that is elaborately rhapsodized). The narrative voice is a continual distraction: knowing who the narrator is supposed to be (a college professor not unlike Wilson), I found that persona unequipped to tell the story being told. Sacrificed is the ecological locus of the novel: the analogy between microcosm and macrocosm in ant and human realms. The most unusual portion of the book is the middle saga, called The Anthill Chronicles , which details the epic rise and fall of a super ant colony. This ant Illiad dramatizes the super-organismal bug's life while reminding the reader that all ant tales are parables. Still, the voice vacillates between depicting anthropomorphic ants in awe of god-like humans and realist ants unconsciously shouldering the wheel of natural selection. Outside the chronicles, the plot is a con- ventional bildung of Cody's development from skittish boy to junior lawyer whiz. Other characters are reduced to sex and class. College- age eco-chicks go bra-less and are wild in the sack; old maids are dotty and smell of urine; poor Southern folks are gun crazy, drunk, and occasionally are homicidal religious zealots. Considered as a first novel by an accomplished ecologist looking back on innocence and experience, Wilson's work deserves credit for dramatizing the land ethic and considering what kind of education</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 701 empowers environmental advocacy- a question that confronts stu- dents as they plot out their own autobiographies. Students may identify with Raff's position between coercion and choice in his life history, and his ability to make good with the old boys without selling out his beloved Nokobee Tract. Raff discovers that environ- mental law ideally teaches tools that forestall both the chainsaw and the need to chain bodies to trees. His answer is a legal compromise that privileges the privileged, but leaves the commons unenclosed. An old aristocratic model, it seems, represents hope in the new South. It's better than a trailer park or a strip mall for the trees and creeping things. Heidi C. M.
