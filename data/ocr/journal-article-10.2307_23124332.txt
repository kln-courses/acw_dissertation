<plain_text><page sequence="1">STEPHEN DA SILVA Transvaluing Immaturity: Reverse Discourses of Male Homosexuality in E. M. Forster's Posthumously Published Fiction Dominant ideology often represents the male homosexual as psychically or somatically arrested, and some of the critical accounts of E. M. Forster's authorial career demonstrate that this stereotype powerfully inflects literary criticism as well: these readings represent texts of Forster which explicitly thematize homosexuality as "imma ture" distractions from a professional developmental trajectory that reaches its aesthetic telos with A Passage to India. Forster's posthu mous texts are both complicit with and resistant to the fiction of the immature homosexual, which so conspicuously informs critical reac tions to them. To put it schematically, Forster employs three contradictory but re lated strategies in reinscribing and challenging the connection be tween immaturity and homosexuality: First, at times, he faithfully rehearses the critical developmental plot and sets up an opposition between the mature demands of great literature and the immature pleasures of homosexuality. In this version of Forster's mythology, great art gets located outside the contingency of history and stands in sharp opposition to homosexual desire, which becomes associated with a movement backwards in time. Second, at other places in the texts, he works within the developmental plot but transvalues it. That is, while he associates male homosexuality with youthfulness, he celebrates this youthfulness and sets it in pointed opposition to the destructive obsession with progress that characterizes heteronor mative culture. In this version of Forster's mythology, the youthful homosexual is represented as having a special access to the pleasures of the body because of his access to lost classical culture as well as "primitive" working-class and non-Western men, an access that is denied to excessively self-conscious, middle-class, "mature" hetero sexual men. Finally, there are still other moments in these texts where through the use of repetition and violent endings, Forster Criticism, Spring 1998, Vol. XL, No. 2, pp. 237-272 Copyright © 1998 Wayne State University Press, Detroit, MI 48201 237</page><page sequence="2">238 Stephen da Silva undermines and reflexively questions the myths that he simulta neously employs: empty repetition in these texts works to undercut their optimism and nostalgia. Further, by associating sterile repeti tion with normative culture's punitive response to homosexuals' transgression of racial, class, and gendered boundaries, he suggests that rather than homosexuals, it is heterosexist society that should be seen as pathologically arrested, endlessly repeating the enforcement of its rigid laws. Similarly, the violent endings of the stories work to unconceal the brutal, indeed deadly, limitations of the generational mythology surrounding homosexuality that Forster is forced to em ploy. In focusing on Forster's posthumously published texts, I do not wish to obscure thematic continuities between texts published during and after his life. Clearly, certain themes and topoi repeatedly appear in Forster's work: The association of Italy and classical Greece with childlike, sensual pleasures that informs many of the stories in The Life to Come can also be found in texts published during his lifetime, such as Where Angels Fear to Tread or the stories of The Celestial Omni bus. The association in Maurice of pastoral England with a non-do mestic space of homoerotic possibility also clearly underlies The Longest Journey. And, the eroticized violence between men of differ ent races and nationalities which I examine in the stories in The Life to Come can also be found in texts like Where Angels Fear to Tread. That the texts published prior to Forster's death are framed in het erosexualized terms does not vitiate my reading of the posthumously published works. For reasons of space, I will elaborate on just one instance of the continuity between the representations of male homo erotics in Forster's posthumously published work and texts pub lished during his lifetime. In this essay, I contend that the violent conclusions of many of the stories in The Life to Come can be read as Forster's self-reflexively commenting on the limitations of the devel opmental narrative which he simultaneously employs in representing male same-sex desire. On the face of it, a novel like Where Angels Fear to Trend might seem to call this claim into question. After all, that novel, published during Forster's lifetime, represents a scene of in tense violence between the Italian Gino and the English protagonist Philip. Yet, Philip and Gino are not lovers, and the novel ends with Philip meditating on his thwarted love for Caroline Abbott. How ever, I would suggest that the novel's triangulated homosocial con figuration places it on a continuum with the texts that more directly thematize homosexuality.1 After all, Philip learns to desire Caroline</page><page sequence="3">Male Homosexuality in Forster's Fiction 239 physically only by heeding the commendations of his male "friend" Gino: "[Philip] had reached love by the spiritual path: [Caroline's] thoughts and her goodness and her nobility had moved him first . . . the beauties of her hair, and her voice, and her limbs—he had no ticed these last; Gino . . . had commended them to his friend."2 If, in The Life to Come, male ethnic and racial others help the English homosex ual to gain access to his body, in the passage above, it is through the mediation of Gino, the Italian male other, that Philip comes to appre hend Caroline physically. Further, while the narrative voice rather abstractly tells us of Philip's mediated physical desire for Caroline, the text vividly dramatizes the two men's sadomasochistic struggle (a struggle, incidentally, which begins with the sadistic Gino "ap proaching" Philip "from behind," thus evoking the thematics of in terracial sodomy and homosexual rape so crucial to many of the stories in The Life to Come),3 as though the imaginative energy of the novel is far more engaged by the bonds between the two men than Philip's relationship with Caroline. The logic of the heterosexual mar riage plot demands that Where Angels Fear to Tread ends with a con sideration of the relationships, even if thwarted, between men and women—Philip's frustrated desire for Caroline and Caroline's frus trated desire for Gino. Yet, the intense scene of physical confrontation between two men refuses to disappear as a mere stage on the way to that conclusion. It functions, I would suggest, as an irreducible sup plement to the novel's ending, both allowing Forster to represent Philip and Gino's eroticized relationship and to register violently the impoverishment of the terms through which he can represent that re lationship.4 In other words, despite the homosocial frame of the text, this scene in the novel functions in the same way as the conclusions to many of Forster's posthumously published texts which more di rectly thematize homosexuality. Far from desiring to quarantine those of Forster's texts which explicitly address homosexual desire from his canonical body of writ ings, I want to underline precisely how tortuous are the developmen tal/generational boundaries some critics have attempted to draw between the supposedly major and minor parts of the Forsterian oeuvre. Unavoidably, though, in challenging this critical developmen tal narrative, I partially reinscribe its terms by artificially separating those texts of Forster that were published posthumously from those published during his lifetime. In that sense, I am in a similar predica ment to Forster himself: in calling into question the (il)logic of a</page><page sequence="4">240 Stephen da Silva dominant developmental narrative, I am forced to rely partially on that narrative's terms. Michel Foucault's model of resistance as articulated in volume one of The History of Sexuality saliently informs my reading of Forster's posthumously published texts. Foucault argues that the same disci plinary discourses that constituted the homosexual as deviant also provided him with a lexicon for articulating resistance: "The series of discourses that made possible a strong advance of social controls into this area of 'perversity' . . . also made possible the formation of a 'reverse' discourse: homosexuality began to speak in its own behalf, to demand that its legitimacy or 'naturality' be acknowledged often using the same categories by which it was medically disqualified" (101 ).5 This powerful theoretical insight allows gay/lesbian theory and politics to complicate the paralyzing opposition between catego ries like reactionary power and progressive resistance. For Foucault's model forces one to recognize that progressive resistance is often si multaneously complicit with and works against the dominant dis course. This recognition makes one shift the focus from morally evaluating strategies of resistance to considering what particular po litical ends those strategies allow and disallow. While I use my analysis of Forster's generational mythology to par ticularize and elaborate the implications of Foucault's anti-founda tional and pragmatic model of resistance, I am not suggesting that one can use any one writer's reverse discourse to generalize about the degree of political success that this model allows. Foucault is rightly suspicious of generalized political claims, and his genealogi cal model of inquiry demands that one work closely with the local and contingent aspect of particular acts of resistance.6 As Alan Sinfield reads Foucault: "When in any instance either incorporation or resis tance turns out to be more successful, that's not in the nature of things. It is because of their relative strengths in that situation. . . . Either outcome depends on the specific balance of historical forces."7 Hence, while I will argue that Forster's particular reverse discourse of homosexuality gives him extremely modest political leverage against his heterosexist culture, I recognize that there are other his torical moments and other reverse discourses which work more effec tively. Apart from the methodological importance of acknowledging the incommensurability of different historical moments, I would suggest there are important political and ethical reasons for doing so. An anti-homophobic reading that is committed to challenging heterosex</page><page sequence="5">Male Homosexuality in Forster's Fiction 241 ist developmental fictions has a particular obligation to challenge his torical models that ignore temporal and cultural differences: unlike a heterosexist developmental narrative which can only arrogantly con ceptualize same-sex desire in its own terms and can, therefore, only see homosexuality as a failed, immature version of heterosexuality, anti-homophobic historical readings should not narcissistically frame the past solely in terms of the present. In making such a statement, I am not arguing for a positivist view of history. With Foucault, I rec ognize that the critic's inquiries are inevitably informed by her per sonal desires and interests, yet while recognizing that historical accounts are mediated, interested constructions, I would suggest that one still has the political obligation to try as far as possible to heed the otherness of the past. Forster himself self-consciously addresses the problem of violating historical difference in several of the essays in Abinger Harvest. In "The Consolations of History," for instance, he gently pokes fun at the ways in which historians can avoid "social and moral" "dangers" by projecting their desires onto the past: "If only a sense of actuality can be lulled—and it sleeps for ever in most historians—there is no passion that cannot be gratified in the past. The past is devoid of all dangers social and moral."8 While in the quotation above there is no explicit value judgment, in the essay on visiting Cnidus which fol lows "The Consolations of History," Forster implicitly suggests that there is something predatory about projecting one's indulgent desires onto the past. In this essay, he recounts how he retrospectively has revised a muddled (to use a characteristically Forsterian term) jour ney that he made to the shrine of Demeter at Cnidus: according to Forster, when he visited Cnidus, there was a storm, and a mysterious man attempted to join his party on its return. Although the stranger was friendly, "everyone avoided [his] attentions," and he finally "melted away in the darkness," an image suggestive of death.9 But Forster confesses that in retrospectively considering this visit, he idealizes it. For instance, he "never cease [s] to dry up [Cnidus's] pud dles, and brush away its clouds, and span[s] it over with blue sky, in which is hanging a mid-day sun that never moves" (178). Although he does not explicitly revise his deathly encounter with the extra male passenger, he enigmatically tells us in the last sentence of the essay, "even over that extra person the brain will not keep steady" (178). We do not know for sure how Forster revises that non-encoun ter with the stranger, and why he should characterize his revision as "not steady." Could it be that in retrospect he tries to endow that</page><page sequence="6">Stephen da Silva frustratingly empty, even deathlike, encounter with some more ideal ized homoerotic content? Regardless of how exactly he reshapes the encounter at Cnidus, it is clear that Forster sees these revisions as as saultive: The experience at Cnidus, he writes, "lies a defenceless prey to the sentimental imagination" (178, my emphasis). But Forster's scruples about appropriating the past and revising it, which are so evident in Abinger Harvest, vanish in his posthumously published texts, where he seems fairly unreflectively to appropriate Greece and other cultures in constructing his reverse discourse of male homosex uality. Before examining that reverse discourse, I will unpack the critical developmental plot which that reverse discourse both draws on and partially resists. The Developmental Plot and Forster's Authorial Career In Epistemology of the Closet, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick points out that there is an ideological link between the binarism homo/heterosexual and such oppositions as innocence/initiation, ignorance/knowledge, and old/new, all terms which have connections with the opposition between the adult and the child.10 This link is not surprising as there has been a long homophobic tradition that has represented the homo sexual as being psychically and /or somatically arrested. Sherwood Williams, for instance, shows how the same nineteenth-century sexo logical discourse that invented the ontological category of homosex uality often described it in terms of atavism. According to the logic of evolutionary nineteenth-century sexologists such as Kiernan and Bolsche, the invert, particularly one who practiced anal intercourse, had remained fixed at an earlier phylogenetic stage of development than his heterosexual contemporaries.11 This discourse was incoherent as it moved between pathologizing the homosexual for being imma ture and for being preternaturally aged or degenerate. Either way, of course, heterosexuality was figured as an unmarked form of adult hood, whose self-evidently natural status was constituted precisely by its difference from a too young or too old homosexuality. These sexological evolutionary fictions also influenced psycho analysis.12 Thus, one of the ways in which Sigmund Freud theorizes homosexuality is as a form of arrested development. In Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, for instance, in a section entitled "Preven tion of Inversion," Freud represents "inversion" as being an ineffec</page><page sequence="7">Male Homosexuality in Forster's Fiction 243 tual, adolescent "fumbling" that is a mere prelude to adult heterosexual intercourse and reproduction: One of the tasks implicit in object choice is that it should find its way to the opposite sex. This, as we know, is not accom plished without a certain amount of fumbling. Often enough the first impulses after puberty go astray, though without any permanent harm resulting. Dessoir has justly remarked upon the regularity with which adolescent boys and girls form sentimental friendships with others. No doubt the strongest force working against a permanent inversion of the sexual object is the attraction which the opposing sexual characters exercise upon one another.13 In this developmental story, the homosexual is represented as some one who is unable to make the transition from "the sentimental friendships" of adolescence to the heterosexuality that should accom pany full adulthood. In fairness to Freud, this is not the only nor the most complex way in which he theorizes homosexuality, but this developmental model has gained such ideological power that even people who have never read a word of Freud "know" that homosex uality is a form of immaturity. For this reason, as Sedgwick, among others, points out, young gay people coming out of the closet often face the authoritative rejoinder that it's just a stage they are going through.14 Apart from sexological and psychoanalytic theories, the notion of same-sex activity as an immature stage that is a mere prelude to adult heterosexuality also shaped the middle-class educational sys tem in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As Sedgwick points out, middle-class Englishmen were expected to form intense homoerotic bonds in school. But they were also expected to relin quish these bonds and move on to occupy their rightful place in so ciety as adult heterosexual patriarchs.15 In such a system, the homosexual was understood as one who remained frozen at the boy hood stage of school friendships. Cyril Connolly, in a much quoted passage from The Enemies of Promise, economically articulates this mythology: "the experiences undergone by boys at the great public schools . . . arrest their development. . . . [Thus] a greater part of the ruling class remains adolescent, school-minded, self-conscious, cow ardly, sentimental, and in the last analysis homosexual."16 The list above shows that for Connolly, being psychically immature "in the last analysis" is equated with being homosexual. While Connolly</page><page sequence="8">Stephen da Silva usefully recognizes the disavowed homoeroticism that lies at the heart of the British male patriarchy, his analysis elides the homoso cial and the homosexual. For even though public school boys had homoerotic experiences, they often did not self-identify as homosex ual, and the whole point of the process was ultimately to channel their desires into serving heterosexual patriarchy. Conversely, many self-identified homosexual men like John Addington Symonds were extremely unhappy in their public schools and sharply disassociated their love for men from the homoeroticism they witnessed at school.17 However, Connolly's misguided formulation accurately ventrilo quizes his culture's understanding of homosexuality as an arrested stage in the normal middle-class Englishman's trajectory from public school to adult responsibility. This cultural figuration of the homosexual as arrested and imma ture powerfully informs critical evaluations of homosexual writers as well.18 F. R. Leavis's single essay on Forster illustrates this claim. At various points, Leavis declares that Forster's works are "unmistaka bly minor," "disconcertingly inexperienced," and "immature."19 Al though he does not directly mention homosexuality, merely coyly declaring that Forster's biographer does not "provide the biographi cal information about Forster that however impertinently, in one sense of the adverb, we should like to have" (261), his repeated, im pertinent (in the denigratory sense of that adjective) feminization of Forster suggests that he is more than aware of the information the biographer withholds.20 The discourses of inversion and immaturity play off each other in Leavis's description of Forster's "light . . . rather spinsterly poise" (262), his "spinsterish inadequacy" (263), and his "lack" of "force or robustness of intelligence" (267). These de scriptions with vicious economy both feminize and infantilize Fors ter, for a "spinster" is a woman who according to the telos of the heterosexual narrative has not attained full maturity since she has not fulfilled the demands of the marriage plot. The other essays in The Common Pursuit, the collection in which the essay on Forster is republished, reinforce how overdetermined Leavis's axiological pro nouncements are by a heterosexist developmental narrative. Thus, in an essay on homosexual W. H. Auden, Leavis predictably speaks of "undergraduate immaturity," and in his essay on bisexual John May nard Keynes, Leavis accuses Keynes and the whole Bloomsbury cir cle, with its strong homosexual ethos, of "undergraduate immaturity" and being "arrest[ed in their] development" (295, 257).</page><page sequence="9">Male Homosexuality in Forster's Fiction 245 The metaphorics of immaturity so central to Leavis's evaluation of Forster also shape the dominant critical narrative regarding Forster's authorial career.21 In Archaeology of Knowledge, Foucault convincingly argues that the collection of texts we consider as constituting the "works" of an author is constructed: The problems raised by the oeuvre are even more difficult. Yet at first sight what could be more simple? A collection of texts that is designated by the proper name of an author. But this designation (even leaving to one side problems of attri bution) is not a homogenous function: does the name of an author designate in the same way a text that he has pub lished under his name, a text that he has presented under a pseudonym, another found after his death in an unfinished draft. . . . The establishment of a complete oeuvre presupposes a number of choices.22 Prior to the publication of Forster's posthumous fiction, the canonical critical account of his oeuvre was invested in a developmental narra tive which represented him as growing through a series of novels which culminated in A Passage to India: Stephen Land, for instance, writes, "If we survey the sequence of Forster's five published novels, we see in outline a creative career of increasingly progressive achievement."23 The title of the first volume of P. N. Furbank's biog raphy of Forster, The Growth of the Novelist, reflects Land's story line. According to this canonical narrative, Forster falls into a mysterious silence after A Passage to India and does not write anything major again. Thus, for instance, in 1953, L. P. Hartley writes, "one of the saddest gaps in the bookshelves of contemporary literature is the space that should be occupied by the unwritten works of Mr. E. M. Forster. ... It is nearly thirty years since ... A Passage to India."24 However, Forster's posthumously published texts challenge the developmental accounts of his writing career. If the canonical story line represents Forster's texts as steadily developing toward the cul mination of A Passage to India, how can it explain stories that were published after A Passage to India, stories, moreover, which explicitly thematize "immature" homosexuality? The heterosexist critical plot can accommodate those posthumously published texts that were written prior to A Passage to India. For even though they are pub lished posthumously, they can be represented as the author's "imma ture" work which leads to the telos of A Passage to India. Thus, Barbara Rosecrance writes of Maurice: "Maurice is a painful book. We</page><page sequence="10">Stephen da Silva must respect the suffering it reveals, but the novel is otherwise largely distinguished by an absence of eloquence and depth that makes Forster a novelist of distinction. . . . [Forster] did write another novel—his greatest [A Passage to India]—after Maurice."25 In Rose crance's account, Maurice is a flawed, immature, superficial symptom of Forster's "suffering," his homosexuality, but it gives way to Fors ter's "greatest" novel, A Passage to India. Maurice in this critical story is an unfortunate stage through which Forster passes on his way to the artistic maturity of A Passage to India. Neil Bartlett has described how, as a closeted gay schoolboy, he both internalized and resisted a version of Rosecrance's critical story: while he tried to convince his teacher at school that Maurice was better than the novel assigned by the educational authorities, A Passage to India, he was simultaneously embarassed about whether in doing so he was betraying an exces sively "adolescent enthusiasm."26 In other words, not only does this developmental critical account impose a heterosexist grid on Forster's career, it also works to discipline the taste of Forster's readers. While Maurice, written more than a decade before A Passage to In dia, neatly fits the developmental account of Forster's career, The Life to Come poses great difficulties to this plot since most of the stories in the anthology were written well after A Passage to India: while A Pas sage to India was published in 1924, "Dr. Woolacott," "Arthur Snatch fold," "The Classical Annex," "What Does It Matter," "The Obelisk," "The Torque," and "The Other Boat" were written in 1927, 1928, 1930-31, probably the 1930s, 1939, 1958 at the latest, and 1957 or '58 respectively. One way to cover this temporal contradiction in the de velopmental story line is to dismiss the quality of the stories as "im mature" because of their subject matter, regardless of when they were written. Thus, they are often dismissed as "light-weight," "mi nor," "self-indulgent."27 These are, of course, the very adjectives that are often used in pathologizing the "immature" homosexual. The adjective "minor" is a good example of the economical way in which seemingly formal evaluative statements are inflected by the develop mental narrative. Robert Martin has pointed out that the adjective "minor" is often used in describing the stories in The Life to Come.28 "Minor," in many of these readings, shifts between two meanings. On the one hand, "minor" implies something "insignificant" as op posed to something central, something "major." On the other hand, "minor" also implies something young, something immature. Through a tight web of associations, then, The Life to Come is seen as unimportant and trivial (minor) because it is young (minor), and its</page><page sequence="11">Male Homosexuality in Forster's Fiction 247 youthfulness is linked to the fact that it represents homosexuality (which is a form of youthfulness). Other related terms often used in dismissing these stories, such as "frivolous"29 or "light-weight,"30 do not directly refer to the stories as immature but reinforce the meta phorics of immaturity that inform representations of homosexuality. Another way to deal with the immature homosexual stories that come after A Passage to India is to represent them as a perverse by way that does not belong on the story line of Forster's authorial ca reer at all. While grudgingly acknowledging that Forster's "pen did not dry up after A Passage to India," to use the explicitly spermatic terms of Judith Hertz,31 these critics figure the stories as a perverse distraction from Forster's "mature" art. Thus Rosecrance chides Alan Wilde for placing the stories in The Life to Come "implicitly on the same conceptual level of A Passage to India," and she suggests that the only reason he does so is because of "their temporal position." But Rosecrance contends that since the stories deal with "a byway of experience, the thrills and punishments of homosexual passion," "these private fantasies debar themselves from consideration or judg ment with the mainstream of Forster's fiction. Thus, despite their greater contemporaneity [to A Passage to India], the homosexual sto ries close the byway opened in Maurice with a no-exit sign [and] di rect our attention to the culmination of Forster's art in A Passage to India."32 On the one hand, Rosecrance criticizes Wilde for misjudging the stories' "minor status" simply because of their "temporal" posi tion. On the other hand, the vehemence of her tone suggests that she too is invested in the "temporal" position of Forster's writings be cause she is invested in a plot in which Forster consistently grows, and the homosexual stories upset the satisfying ending of that devel opmental story line. So, she attempts to exclude them from her criti cal plot by suggesting that they are irrelevant to the "mainstream" of Forster's art. They are a mere "private," "dead end" "byway" that should not distract us from the true "culmination" of Forster's career in A Passage to India. Rosecrance's metaphors and critical story line draw on sexological and psychoanalytic representation of homosex uality as a non-reproductive perversion. Just as a "perversion" is de fined in sexological and psychoanalytic discourse as a swerving away from the path toward reproductive adulthood, so too the stories in The Life to Come are mere byways to the mainstream which leads to A Passage to India. Her phrase "dead end" is particularly sinister, given dominant culture's persistent association of male homosexuality with anal intercourse and death.33 In other words, while Forster's true art</page><page sequence="12">Stephen da Silva leads to the healthy aesthetic maturity of A Passage to India, homosex ual texts like Maurice and the stories in The Life to Come lead to the unproductive, "dead end" traditionally associated with sodomy. Literature versus Immature Homoeroticism: Forster's Complicity with the Developmental Narrative Unhappily, Forster himself at various places internalizes the homo phobic, developmental account of literary production I have traced above. For instance, after burning a number of his stories in April 1922, he wrote in his diary, "Have this moment burnt my indecent writings. . . . They clogged me artistically. . . . When I . . . began them, I had a feeling that I was doing something . . . dangerous to my career . . . they were a wrong channel for my pen."34 In this for mulation, Forster employs precisely the hydraulic developmental metaphors that homophobic critics use in describing his posthumous writings. The journal entry implies that the homosexual writer has to renounce the stories which thematize sodomy, "the wrong channel," for they will "clog" his artistic development. Like his homophobic critics, then, Forster too sets "true" art or Literature in opposition to the irresponsible, deviant pleasures of homosexuality. Incidentally, Forster's description of how the stories were destroyed—"Have this moment burnt my indecent writings"—intertextually resonates with this passage from Maurice also figuring a relinquishing of immature homoeroticism: Clive Durham on his return from Greece finds that he has lost his homoerotic feelings and is ready to assume his posi tion as an adult male heterosexual subject, and the narrative voice exclaims, "the love of women would rise, certainly as the sun, scorch ing up immaturity and ushering in the full human day."35 Just as Clive's homoerotic "immaturity" is "scorchfed] up," then, Forster's homosexual stories are consigned to the flames, so he can move for ward to artistic maturity. One should add, though, that while the quoted passage in Maurice is in free indirect discourse and represents Clive's position, a position from which the narrative voice maintains considerable ironic distance, the passage cited from Forster's journal seems anything but ironic. It is not surprising that Forster should set up an opposition be tween homosexuality and great art, for like many modernists, he be lieves that great art transcends history while, as we will see at greater length in the next section of the essay, he often associates homosexuality with a movement back in time:36 Aspects of the Novel</page><page sequence="13">Male Homosexuality in Forster s Fiction best illustrates Forster's characteristically Modernist distrust of his tory. In this text, he repudiates historicist interpretations of literature and contends that rather than regarding the English novelists as in fluencing each other temporally, we are to think of them seated to gether in a circular room, writing their novels simultaneously, removed from the contingent flux of history: "We are to visualize the English novelists not as floating down that stream [the stream of time] but as seated together in a room, a circular room ...[,] all writ ing their novels simultaneously. They do not as they sit there, think, 'I live under Queen Victoria, ... I carry on the tradition of Trol lope."37 Later, he approvingly cites T. S. Eliot's contention that the "duty of the critic" is "to see [literature] not as consecrated by time, but to see it beyond time" (15). Significantly, Forster uses a homo erotically charged example to illustrate the difference between an immature attachment to temporality and the true critic's distrust of mere time: in a section entitled "Story," Forster declares that as a boy he "loved . . . The Swiss Family Robinson . . .[with its] four demigods named Fritz, Ernest, Jack, and little Franz," and that even now he could deliver "a glowing lecture" on that tale "because of the emo tions [he] felt in boyhood." But, he goes on, such feelings should not be indulged in until one's "brain decays entirely." The mature critic's concern is "great literature," and "great literature" transcends tem porality (21). In this example, Forster links pleasure in mere tempor ality, which he associates with the formal category "story" as opposed to "plot," both to pathology (the decayed brain, etc.) and the implicitly homoerotic figures of the "four demigods named Fritz, Ernst, Jack, and little Franz" of The Swiss Family Robinson. And in op position to the suspect, immature pleasures of temporality and the male demigods of the celebrated boys' story, he sets great literature which transcends history and the temporality connected with mere "story." The opposition between immature homosexual pleasures and ma ture heterosexual art appears in The Life to Come also, but in the short stories, youthful homosexuality is usually privileged over the sup posedly adult worlds of writing and literature. In the story "Ansell," for instance, it is precisely the first person narrator's bookishness—he is working on his dissertation—that cuts him off from his boyhood friend, the gamekeeper Ansell: "We [the narrator and Ansell] were now so very different that comparison was painful. ... I was writing a dissertation on the Greek optative for a Fellowship and Ansell was now gamekeeper."38 When the narrator's books are destroyed in the</page><page sequence="14">Stephen da Silva river, he represents it in the catastrophic terms of amputation or cas tration—"It means—well it's as if you [Ansell] had to lose your leg" (LC 3-4). And yet it is precisely the loss of the books which allows the narrator to communicate with Ansell and to reach an idyllic hom oerotic union with him at the end of the story: "Ansell began to talk. . . . The weight of the books which had kept him down . . . had fallen into the river, and now he was at his own level and could speak of the things he cared for" (LC 7). "Ansell has appropriated me, and I have no time to think of the future. . . . Whenever we look at the place [where the books fell over into the stream], Ansell . . . laughs, and I laugh too" (LC 9). It is the destruction of the books, then, which allows the narrator to return to his joyous boyhood union with An sell and to forget about the future. In both the journal entry and in his posthumous stories, Forster draws on the terms of a developmental narrative to conceptualize homosexuality. In contrast to the journal entry, though, which faith fully repeats a denigratory heterosexist developmental narrative, in most of the posthumously published works, Forster affirms the connection between homosexuality and youthfulness but attempts to transvalue the implications of youthfulness in order to celebrate male homosexual desire. Youthful Homosexuality and the Return to the Past Forster's posthumously published texts draw on many of the same terms that are used to pathologize them: if normative culture equates homosexuality with childishness, these writings too associate realiz ing homosexual desire with moving back in time or returning to childhood. For instance, Maurice represents the realization of homo sexual fulfillment as the recovery of a lost childhood object of desire. At the beginning of the novel, Maurice loses the garden boy George, significantly because George has become "too old" (M 17). Maurice tries to convince himself that this loss is insignificant and to adapt himself to the demands of the heterosexual marriage plot: "[Maurice] whispered, 'George, George.' Who was George? Nobody—just a com mon servant. Mother and Ada and Kitty were far more important" (M 19). But the whole of the novel can be read as Maurice's finding his way back to that lost childhood object. For closure is achieved when Maurice reaches lasting physical intimacy with the working class gamekeeper Alec Scudder who both in his class and pastoral profession evokes the lost garden boy, George, from the beginning of</page><page sequence="15">Male Homosexuality in Forster's Fiction 251 story. In other words, in Maurice, realizing homosexual desire is rep resented as recovering a lost past. This pattern can also be seen in many of the short stories in The Life to Come. To take just one instance, in "The Other Boat," Lionel is able to experience his homosexual desires on the boat traveling from En gland to India, by repeating his childhood encounter with Cocoanut on another boat traveling in the opposite direction. Lionel's second meeting with Cocoanut is full of uncanny echoes of the first one. To take one sinister example: on the earlier boat, the boy Lionel had wanted Cocoanut to "play" because "he [was] the only one who fell down when he [was] killed" (LC 166). On the second boat, Lionel and Cocoanut play again, this time in the closeted space of their cabin, and once again Lionel kills Cocoanut, as in their boyhood games. In "Arthur Snatchfold" an early morning homosexual encounter foregrounds the link between youthfulness and homosexuality. Ag ing Sir Richard Conway—we are told he has "grey hair"—is hemmed in by his responsibilities as a heterosexual patriarch and businessman and is depressed by the dullness and sterility of the Donaldson's home (LC 97-98). But he is able temporarily to escape these restraints in his early-morning tryst with Arthur Snatchfold in the woods. The sexual play between Conway and Snatchfold is described in terms of boyish horseplay: "[Conway] tweaked at the impudent nose [of Snatchfold]. It dodged, it seemed used to this sort of thing" (102). Horseplay, in fact, plays an important role in Forster's figuring of male homosexual pleasure—think of the constant "ragging" between Clive and Maurice (M 44)—perhaps both because "horseplay" pro vides a genteel way to represent physical intimacy between men but also because Forster associates realizing homosexual desire with re covering youthful pleasures. At the end of "Arthur Snatchfold," in order to preserve his safety and "go forward with his career" (LC 112), Conway has to suppress the early morning boyish pleasures he shared with Arthur Snatchfold. Significantly, we are told at the end of the story that Conway's "face" in the mirror "was that of an old man" (112). In other words, having to relinquish the youthful matu tinal pleasures of homosexuality, Conway returns to being an old man living in the drab afternoon or evening hours of heteronorma tive culture.39 Apart from moving back in time at an ontogenetic level, homosex ual characters in Forster's posthumously published fiction also move back in history. In particular, they tend to return to Greece. In his Commonplace Book, Forster approvingly quotes Marx's description of</page><page sequence="16">252 Stephen da Silva Greece as embodying "the social childhood of Humanity" and his description of the Greeks as "normal, healthy children.40 It is consis tent with this conception of Greece that in order to experience their childlike homosexual desires, many of the characters in The Life to Come should move back in time to Greece: In "Albergo Empedocle," for instance, Harold, who is getting ready to marry Mildred, falls asleep between "two ruined columns of the temple of Zeus" at Gir genti, which the editor tells us "are clearly the legs of a gigantic male figure" (LC 235). In this sleep, Harold discovers that he has lived in Greece in an earlier time and has "loved better too" (24-25). As Har old begins to revert to his Greek persona, the only one whom he thinks might understand him is his friend Tommy: '"Is there no, no one who understands?' [Harold cried out.] He stumbled up the pas sage as if he were blind and they heard him calling 'Tommy'" (32). The story ends with Harold who has now completely slipped away from the modern world into his Greek past kissing his attentive friend Tommy (35). If in a psychoanalytic narrative, homosexuality represents an early stage that must be left behind in order to move to adult heterosexuality, in "Albergo Empedocle," Harold has to slip backward in time to a past life, his Greek childhood, in order to avoid the confines of compulsory heterosexuality and achieve union with Tommy. "The Classical Annex" is slightly different from "Albergo Empedo cle" in that Denis, the homosexual figure, is a boy, rather than an adult, and the statue is a "late Roman," rather than Greek work. But the terms of the story's discourse participate in the same logic as that of "Albergo Empedocle." It sets up an opposition between the adult curator who is influenced both by rationalism and middle-class Prot estant values and his son Denis and the classical statue, both of whom are linked to a youthful, sensual, classical past. When the statue in the museum comes alive and makes a pass at the curator, he is scandalized by this "obscene breath from the past" (LC 149) and flees from the museum. But his beautiful young son Denis responds to the seductive advances of the statue with pleasure and amuse ment: "Then far away the [curator] heard a familiar, an adorable sound: a giggle. Denis was laughing at something. ... he heard his son, 'aren't you awful?' and there was the sound of a kiss" (150). In at least two places in the story, one gets the sense that the curator at some level wants to do to his son precisely what the statue is doing: early in the story, when the curator is trying to replace the fig leaf on the statue, he thinks "how much more personable" "than this classi</page><page sequence="17">Male Homosexuality in Forster's Fiction cal lout" "Denis" is (148). Later in the tale, the curator perceives Den is's giggle as "adorable," an ambiguously sentimental adjective which eroticizes the curator's paternal concern. The adult, "modern" (149) curator, however, cannot return to the past at either an ontoge netic or phylogenetic level, and so is cut off from the youthful homo sexual pleasures of Denis and the statue. In some of the texts, the homoerotic movement back in time in volves a return to England's pastoral past, rather than a return to Greece. In Maurice, for instance, Maurice and Scudder return to En gland's greenwood. We know from the pageant in Forster's Abinger Harvest that the writer associates the woods with an idealized, prein dustrial state of harmony. In that pageant, the greenwood is repre sented as both being ancient and "eternal," "an antidote to the fruits of modern progress," "houses and bungalows, hotels, restaurants and flats, arterial roads, by-passes, petrol pumps, and pylons."41 By mak ing Maurice and Scudder return to the greenwood, Forster links homoerotic desire to a pastoral England prior to the fall into capital ism and urbanization. The same link can be seen in "Ansell" where the early morning encounter, as I have said, takes place in the woods. Another manifestation of the link between homosexuality and youthfulness is Forster's emphasis on cross-racial, cross-national homosexual relationships. For Forster, non-Western men seem asso ciated with youthfulness. Hence, many of the stories in The Life to Come use youthful and infantilizing language to figure the non Western men whom the Englishmen desire. For instance, in "The Other Boat," Lionel's Eurasian lover Cocoanut is at various points described as "adolescent" (LC 174), a "subtle, supple boy" (174), "a weird youth" (171), and "kid" (194). Similarly, in the short story "The Life to Come," Vithobai, the non-Western lover of the Christian mis sionary Paul Pinmay, is initially described in youthful terms as a "gracious and bare-limbed boy" (LC 68). But when Vithobai converts to Christianity and becomes Barnabas, he loses his youth and be comes old and sick, as though his primitive youthfulness is cor rupted by Western culture. At the end of the story, however, when Barnabas returns to his pagan persona, Vithobai, and stabs the mis sionary, so they might be united together in the life to come, he re gains his youth: "He rejoiced as in his boyhood" (82). In the same vein, in "The Torque" we are told that the barbarian Goths, who will rape the Christian Marcian and allow him to discover the pleasures of a younger, pre-Christian, pagan sensuality, have "childish" faces (LC 157) and are "wild boys" (157). In associating homoerotic desire</page><page sequence="18">254 Stephen da Silva with the crossing of racial and national boundaries, Forster also asso ciates it with crossing generational ones. By realizing their desire for men of other races, English homosexuals are able to recover their youthfulness, in a way denied to heterosexual men. But it is not simply the objects of desire that link youthfulness to homoeroticism in The Life to Come. The insistent association of homo erotic pleasure with a movement to non-Western spaces also estab lishes that link. Johannes Fabian has pointed out how "evolutionary anthropology" "spacializes time," and Forster deploys a similar tech nique. Just as the anthropologist, in Fabian's argument, imagines that he is moving to another time when he moves to another culture, so too Western homosexuals in The Life to Come often move back in time when they move into non-Western spaces.42 In "The Other Boat," for instance, when Lionel comes aboard the ship in England, he is an adult "soldier man," who is revolted at Cocoanut's sexual advances (LC 174); he certainly doesn't want to play. But as the ship moves toward the East, it is Lionel who in an actively passive fashion makes the next sexual move: "Resistance weakened under the balmier sky. . . . Cocoanut was leaning out of the porthole to see the sunlit rock of Gibraltar. Lionel leant against him to look too and permitted a slight, very slight familiarity with his person." "More happened off the coast of Sicily, more, much more at Port Said, and here in the Red Sea they slept together as a matter of course" (177). The narrator's scrupulous mapping of the ship's trajectory functions to make geog raphy as much as Lionel the active agent in this seduction. It is "the balmier sky" and "the sunlit rock of Gibraltar" that allow Lionel to initiate the moves that will allow him to move back in time to his childhood intimacy with Cocoanut, and the further east they move, the greater their ability to slip back in time. This spacialization of time can also be seen on the boat itself. During the day, Lionel plays the role of the proper, adult, colonial Englishman, playing bridge with his fellow Englishmen on deck. But at night he descends to his cabin, for while Lionel and Cocoanut can't "associate on deck," "it [is] a very different business down there" (173). In other words, night and the childhood intimacy of Lionel and Cocoanut become asso ciated spatially with the cabin below deck, as well as the "lower" pleasures of genital (homo)sexuality. A similar connection between time and place can be seen in "The Life to Come." The "remote, ro mantic spot" (LC 65) of the forest hut surrounded by its vast aged trees represents a pre-historical space in which Western inhibitions can be completely shunned. Hence, in the forest, Paul Pinmay can</page><page sequence="19">Male Homosexuality in Forster's Fiction 255 enjoy sex with Vithobai. In the forest too, Paul Pinmay's youth is re peatedly stressed—he is described as a "young man" with "pagan limbs and ruffled gold hair" (65) and as "a very young man" (66). But as the "development" that the Christian missionaries bring to the natives destroys the timeless forest (74), Pinmay grows older—his hair grows "scanty" and it is no longer golden—and more dogmati cally intolerant of the youthful pleasures that he could enjoy in that vernal space—he is obsessed, for instance, with the natives covering their pagan limbs (cf. 70 and 78). The destruction of this primitive space, then, becomes equivalent to destroying the possibility of mov ing back to an earlier time. In associating the homosexual with youthfulness, Forster is compli cit with several conservative discourses, supporting Foucault's con tention that resistance is always implicated with power. For instance, in representing Greece as a valorized, childlike space, The Life to Come draws on the canonical terms of a long tradition of nineteenth- and twentieth-century British Hellenism. The poles of "The Classical An nex," for instance, have a clear affinity with Matthew Arnold's dis tinctions between Hebraism and Hellenism in Culture and Anarchy. In "The Classical Annex," the past is regarded nostalgically, and we are meant to see that part of the curator's inadequacy is his complete commitment to modernity: his mind is described ironically as "pow erful and modern" (LC 149). This same tone of nostalgia for the class ical past permeates Arnold's essay: for instance, he writes of the movement from Hellenism to Hebraism, "the bright promise of Hel lenism faded and Hebraism ruled the world."43 Further, the represen tation of the community of Bigglesmouth in "The Classical Annex" clearly draws on Arnold's critique of Hebraism. For Arnold, one of the greatest weaknesses of Hebraism is its obsession with sin: "the space which sin fills in Hebraism ... is prodigious" (469). The com munity of Bigglesmouth embodied in Town Councilor Bodkin exem plifies this Hebraistic tendency. Thus, Bodkin and the town councilors, all "God-fearing men" (LC 149), are continually preoccu pied with preserving "decency" (150), and it is their desire to protect their children from sin—"You never know where young people may not pick up dirty thoughts"—that leads to them covering the classical statue's genitalia with an iron fig leaf. The discursive terms of The Life to Come, then, draw on many of the commonplaces of nineteenth and early twentieth-century British Hellenism which undergirded British male homosocial culture.</page><page sequence="20">256 Stephen da Silva Forster's fictions are also complicit with primitivism and the dis course of evolutionary anthropology. For instance, as we have seen, Forster figures non-Western men as childlike. This representation is resonant with a long tradition of evolutionary anthropology. As writ ers such as George Stocking Jr., Marianne Torgovnic, Adam Kuper, Christopher Herbert, and others have amply documented, many Vic torian and Edwardian anthropologists represented people from non Western cultures as childlike primitives.44 In these accounts, which were shaped by a vulgarized theory of evolutionary development, non-Western cultures became childish precursors to adult Western societies. Conversely, as historians of youth like John Springhall have shown, Anglo-American adolescent boys were often figured in terms that linked them to "primitive," non-Western cultures. For instance, Stanley Hall, in his enormously influential 1904 study Adolescence, argued that every individual passes through all the historical stages of humankind.45 The adolescent, in this ontogenetic recapitulation of human phylogeny, occupies a position analogous to the non-Western primitive, and it is enormously important to "civilize" him, so he can move beyond this state to reach his rightful position as an adult, male Western subject. Further, Forster tends to associate the non-Western man with an intense eroticism which blurs the boundaries between self and other and this representation is consistent with discourse of anthropologi cal primitivism. As Herbert has pointed out, anthropological fictions of primitivism figured the primitive as intensely sensual and com pletely uninhibited. Hence Victorian and Edwardian anthropologists like McLennan stressed the originary promiscuity of primitive tribes.46 The point was that in these youthful societies, there was no sense of individuation or boundaries. A sense of selfhood and a con trol over the passions in these accounts is a product of civilized Western culture. A version of these same fictions informs the dis course of The Life to Come. In many of the stories, the sexuality of "primitive" cultures is represented as completely unbounded and lacking any sense of individuation. The excitement of these "primi tive" cultures for the Western homosexual protagonists is that it helps them to dissolve the restrictive, adult boundaries of selfhood that their culture has imposed on them. "The Other Boat," for instance, ends with a powerful and deadly sadomasochistic encounter between Lionel and Cocoanut, in which it is very difficult to separate sex from violence (note, for instance, how orgasm and death get conflated in the phrase, "when the end came")</page><page sequence="21">Male Homosexuality in Forster's Fiction 257 or to completely distinguish the two men from each other: "[Co coanut] lowered his mouth onto the muscular forearm and bit it. . . . The sweet act of vengeance followed, sweeter than ever for both of them and as ecstacy hardened into agony his hands twisted the throat. Neither of them knew when the end came" (LC 195-96). Lio nel's hands are the only things that are distinct here ("His hands twisted the throat"). For the rest of the passage, it is very difficult to keep the actors separate, or to discern exactly what is happening. Whose "ecstasy" is "hardening"? Who is feeling "agony"? Any sense of separation between the two men collapses inward into the "them." Similarly, violence and erotic pleasure blur into each other in this scene. The scene begins with Cocoanut asking for a kiss, but when the kiss is denied, he bites Lionel. Biting and kissing, ecstasy and ag ony, orgasm and literal death all collapse into each other. This repre sentation of orgiastic, boundless erotic pleasure conforms with Western culture's fantasies about the complete absence of repression in and the insatiable sexuality of childlike, primitive cultures. While the stories in The Life to Come draw on and are undeniably complicit with the problematic terms of conservative discourses of Hellenism and primitivism, Forster does attempt partially to alter these conservative vocabularies in order to create a limited reverse discourse to celebrate and affirm homosexuality.47 No doubt, for in stance, Forster associates the homosexual with the childlike, and in doing so, he is complicit with a heterosexist developmental narrative. However, rather than denigrating the child as immature when com pared to the mature adult, Forster in many of the stories associates the child with a more healthy relationship to the body and greater perceptiveness than the adults. In "The Classical Annex," for in stance, the young boy Denis, unlike his father, the curator, shows no horror or terror at the homosexual advances of a classical statue. For while the adults in the story are fearfully anxious about repudiating sexuality, Denis is amused by it—note the contrast, for instance, be tween the council's decision to protect children by covering the stat ue's genitalia with Denis's going to meet his father with "practically nothing on but his football shorts" (LC 149). Not only are heterosex ual adults extremely imperceptive in this story—note how the coun cil at the end of the story looks at the sculpture of Denis and the statue making love and can only perceive it as a wrestling match (153)—they are also associated with a deadly stasis. After all, the cu rator's prayer, intended to "protect" Denis from the delightful homo sexual pleasures he is sharing with the statue, ends up literally</page><page sequence="22">23S Stephen da Silva petrifying the boy. Vitality and perceptiveness are associated with the child and the homoerotic rather than the adult world of hetero sexuality. This same inversion can be seen in Forster's representation of the public school. Like Connolly, Forster attacks the public school as the source of the arrested emotional development of Englishmen, but, unlike Connolly, Forster does not associate this immaturity with homosexuality. Indeed, like his homophile precursor Edward Car penter, Forster sees childlike homosexuality as offering an alternative to the emotional sterility of the public school. Forster mounts his most detailed critique of public school ideology in the essay "Notes on the English Character." In this essay, he contends that "just as the heart of England is the middle classes, so the heart of the middle classes is the public-school system," but these institutions produce men who are hopelessly emotionally stunted: "[Public school men] go forth into [the world] with well-developed bodies, well-developed minds, and undeveloped hearts."48 In contrast, to the emotionally ste rile world of the English public school, Forster invokes "a world that is not entirely composed of public-school men or even of Anglo-Sax ons, but of men who are various as the sands of the sea; ... a world of whose richness and subtlety [public-school Englishmen] can have no conception" (5). This richly subtle international male community becomes particularized later in the essay when Forster compares his own need prudently to measure out his emotions with his "Oriental" male friend's emotional "kingly munificence and splendour." Ma sood, whom we know to be the unnamed "Oriental friend" in the es say, accuses Forster of measuring out his emotions "as if they were potatoes," and Forster responds that such prudence "is better than slopping them [emotions] about like water from a pail" (6). The sper matic metaphor suggests that the sterile world of the public school makes the Englishman scared of depleting his erotic resources as well as his emotions: "if I [Forster] poured it [emotion/semen?] out on small occasions, I was afraid of having none left for the great ones and for being bankrupt for the crises of life." By contrast, Masood with perverse grandeur believes that "the emotions may be endless. The more we express them, the more we have to express" (6-7). Fors ter's homoerotic bond with Masood, then, offers him a way to dis cover a more generous view of the world than that offered by the world of the public school. In Maurice too, we see the inversion of Connolly's link between immature homosexuality and the ethos of the school. Maurice's</page><page sequence="23">Male Homosexuality in Forster's Fiction 259 school, designed to prepare boys to occupy the position of heterosex ual subjects, is characterized by deadly stasis—for instance, to the principal of Sunnington, his charges appear "a race small but com plete, like the New Guinea pygmies,' [his] boys'" (M 10). In other words, like a racist anthropologist, the headmaster freezes the boys in time and regards them as perfectly finished, dead specimens. Para doxically, for Maurice to grow, he must break out of this petrifying school atmosphere and move backward in time to the greenwood and the childlike pleasures of homoeroticism.49 Just as Forster both draws on and inverts the heterosexual develop mental narrative, he both employs the terms of Arnoldian Hellenism and transforms them. As Richard Dellamora has pointed out, while Arnold is deeply nostalgic for Greece, his vision of Greece is a de eroticized, cerebral one.50 Repeatedly, Arnold associates Greece with intellectual clarity, "The uppermost idea of Hellenism is to see things as they really are."51 But for Forster, in stories like "Albergo Empedo cle" and "The Classical Annex," Greece becomes a sensual, homo erotically charged signifier. In fact, in many of these stories, intellectual Hellenists of the Arnoldian variety are denied access to the true knowledge of Greece that "youthful" homosexuals have. In "Albergo Empedocle," for instance, Mildred Peaslake and her father are far better educated Hellenists than Harold, yet they are com pletely unable to perceive the Greek past he does. Similarly, in "The Classical Annex," although or perhaps because the curator has been trained at Oxford (LC 149) and has a developed taste for classical art (147), the living manifestation of the homoerotic classical past terri fies him, and it is his completely naive son Denis who responds in a childlike, sensual fashion associated with the classical world. In "An sell," the narrator may be studying the Greek optative, but he only discovers the true Hellenic spirit when he discards his books and sur renders to the garden boy Ansell. Finally, in Maurice, it is Clive, rather than Maurice, who is deeply invested in classical culture. But significantly as Clive's homosexuality slips away from him, he can only find Greece moribund. "Clive sat in the theatre of Dionysus. . . . But he saw only dying light and a dead land. He knew that the past was devoid of meaning like the present" (M 113). Without living homosexual desire, a desire that Maurice will realize with Scudder, Greece is dead for Clive. As critics like Frank Turner have pointed out, classical studies bound together the male homosocial elite of British culture, for En glishmen from the Victorian period on were immersed in Greek at</page><page sequence="24">260 Stephen da Silva both the public school and the university.52 At the same time, homo phobic British culture attempted to disavow the male same-sex desire which was so central to Greek culture. Note, for instance, how Dean Cornwallis at Maurice's college at Cambridge attempts to repress any discussion of homosexuality in Greece, "Mr. Cornwallis observed in a flat toneless voice, 'Omit: a reference to the unspeakable vice of the Greeks'" (M 50). By insistently linking Greece to a physical realiza tion of homosexual desire, Forster aggressively forces the male homo social community to acknowledge the homoeroticism of Greece which they would rather disavow. But Forster's use of Greece does not merely challenge male homo social representations of the classics but a strand of male homosexual discourse as well. Linda Dowling has explored how Platonic peder asty provided intellectuals at Oxford with a powerfully enabling homophilic vocabulary. Although she emphasizes the distinction between the temperaments of Oxford and Cambridge, many of her assertions can be usefully applied to Cambridge as well.53 As at Ox ford, at Cambridge Platonic pederasty provided a way to defend same-sex desire, and many of Forster's mentors, perhaps most nota bly Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, powerfully associated their hom osexuality with Plato, particularly the Plato of Symposium and Phaedrus. But as Lionel Trilling points out, unlike Dickinson, Forster's brand of Hellenism resists the asceticism of Plato: "We know of Fors ter that he is a Hellenist but not a 'classicist.' . . . that Plato has never meant much to him perhaps because he mistrusts the Platonic drive to the absolute and the Platonic judgment on the body and senses."54 In his work, Forster sometimes pits a sensual, chthonic, pre-Platonic Greece against the ascetic, cerebral Platonic Greece of Dickinson and Clive. In constructing this distinction, Forster draws on Jane Harri son's revisionary feminist account of Greece.55 Harrison argued that prior to the creation of the anthropomorphic Olympian pantheon, matriarchal Greek culture had a collective, organic unity with nature that was disrupted by the virile individuating culture of the Olympic deities.56 Harrison's influence is evident in Maurice where Forster op poses Clive's ascetic faith in the motherless, virginal Athene—"Here dwelt his [Clive's] gods—Pallas Athene in the first place. . . . She un derstood all men though motherless and a virgin" (M 113)—with Maurice and Scudder's physically fulfilled homosexual desire in the greenwood that Forster in his "Afterword" explicitly associates with the maternal womb: lamenting the loss of the greenwood, Forster writes, "There is no forest or fell to escape to today, no cave in which</page><page sequence="25">Male Homosexuality in Forster s Fiction 261 to curl up, no deserted valley for those . . . who wish to be left alone" (M 250, my emphasis).57 As with Arnoldian Hellenism, The Life to Come is both complicit with and partially transvalues a primitivist discourse of evolutionary anthropology. For the evolutionary anthropologist, the primitive was someone insufficient who needed to be developed. Thus, this dis course sustained the logic of colonialism: Western nations took over primitive societies in order to educate and civilize the childish na tives. In this discourse, then, development was represented as some thing positive. But in The Life to Come, the "development" that Western culture brings is represented as being horrifically destruc tive. In the story "The Life to Come," for instance, the conversion of Vithobai and the invasion of the Western Christian missionaries leads to the destruction of the forest, epidemics among the villagers, and brutal economic exploitation. Further, in this story, Forster draws an implicit analogy between the limitations of the marriage plot and the colonial, developmental one. At the beginning of the story, Vithobai the primitive shares his homoerotic pleasure with Pinmay in the forest. But as Vithobai "pro gresses" toward marriage, Christianity, and westernization, his cul ture is systematically destroyed. The metonymic linkage of marriage with Christianity and westernization suggests that just as the hetero sexist developmental plot violently erases same-sex desire, the "prog ress" of colonial and Christian values ruthlessly destroys indigenous cultures. Neither plot can recognize difference; rather, difference is immediately read as primitive or immature and attempts are made to erase it. Clearly, drawing a comparison between two incommen surate oppressions is politically problematic, but Forster's analogy suggests that he is not merely internalizing primitivist discourse but is attempting to critique it to some extent. Not only does Forster criticize the developmental narrative of co lonial anthropology, he also inverts it. While in the developmental narrative of evolutionary anthropology, the primitive is the child who needs to be educated by the adult Westerner, in The Life to Come, it is the Western homosexual who learns from the "primitive." The lessons that the youthful primitive is able to teach the Western homo sexual include taking pleasure in the body. In "The Other Boat," for instance, Cocoanut teases Lionel saying, "Lion, he don't know noth ing at all. Monkey's got to come along to tell a lion he's alive" (LC 181). And indeed, it is Cocoanut who thaws Lionel's frozen, re pressed sexual desire (192-93). Similarly, Paul Pinmay the Christian</page><page sequence="26">Stephen da Silva missionary in "The Life to Come" glibly talks of love but is alienated from the pleasures of the body. By literalizing the Christian formula, "God is love," and sleeping with Pinmay in the forest, Vithobai offers the missionary the possibility of confronting the lovelessness of his strain of Christianity and the emptiness of his professions of love. For Forster, the middle-class man's learning of bodily pleasure seems to be often implicated with the experience of being penetrated. Repeat edly in the stories, the experience of being buggered by a younger, "primitive," or working-class man helps the overly cerebral English man/middle-class man to move from pure consciousness to an ac knowledgment of his body: In "Arthur Snatchfold," for instance, the aged Sir Richard Conway is able to exult youthfully in his body after being penetrated by the working-class milkman. Similarly, even though in Maurice the first physical encounter between Scudder and Maurice is not explicitly figured in terms of anal intercourse, Scud der's forceful entry through the window of Maurice's bedroom evokes the thematics of penetration, and it is through Scudder that Maurice recovers his youth. Beyond teaching the middle-class Englishman physical pleasure, the primitive destabilizes the Englishman's sense of integrity and forces him to confront the constructedness of identity. In "The Other Boat," for instance, Lionel starts out with a deep faith in a phallogo centric notion of selfhood. He views his name as guaranteeing the unequivocal nature of his identity and stoutly pronounces the almost mystical tautology, "My name is Lionel March and that's my name" (LC 184). For Lionel, culture/the father/the law puts its stamp of ap proval on the essential identity of things by conferring motivated proper names on them; thus as a boy he sternly declares to Cocoanut that everything "must have a name because Adam named all the ani mals when the Bible was beginning" (167). But Cocoanut, the primi tive, non-Western man is characterized by his shifting identity and his hybridity—he has different names for different people (to the people on deck he is known by his Eurasian surname, "Moraes," but for Lionel, he is "Cocoanut" because of the shape of his head); he has two passports ("one of the passports was Danish, the other Portu guese"); he is racially mixed ("half the blood must be Asiatic, unless a drop was Negro") and hence looks neither black nor white but has a "blackish-greyish skin" (173); and his gender appears indetermi nate, so Mrs. March in some exasperation calls him "a silly, idle, use less, unmanly little boy" (170, my emphasis). Given Cocoanut's indeterminacy, it is no wonder that he should be radically skeptical</page><page sequence="27">Male Homosexuality in Forster's Fiction 263 of a system built around the unified self, and he destabilizes Lionel's certainties. Thus, by the end of the story, Lionel loses his rigidly de fined sense of self and ecstatically merges with Cocoanut in a mo ment of deadly sadomasochistic intensity. It is important, I would suggest, that we do not join Lionel (and Forster perhaps) in mystify ing Cocoanut's hybridity in metaphysical terms by locating him out side or beyond culture; to do so would be to dehumanize him in a familiarly Orientalist fashion. Rather, we should see Cocoanut as un concealing the constructedness of all subjects. Lionel's identity, after all, is just as artificially constituted as that of Cocoanut, but from his unmarked position as a Western, adult male subject, he cannot per ceive its fictiveness until he sees it through the defamiliarizing lens of seemingly exotic Cocoanut. In addition to inverting and transvaluing dominant developmental fictions of homosexuality, Forster also relies in his posthumous texts on empty repetition and violent endings to deconstruct the brutal (il)logic of those fictions. Empty Repetition and Violent Endings Both the title story of The Life to Come and Maurice illustrate the tortuous temporal split that Forster associates with realizing homo sexual desire. "The Life to Come" begins in the past perfect tense: "Love had been born in the forest" (LC 65). Right at the beginning of the story, then, we are already looking retrospectively, at a homosex ual passion that lies in the past. The story ends with Vithobai killing Pinmay, so he can recover the love they had in the life to come. However, the recovery of their passion does not enter representation. Forster told Siegfried Sassoon that he attempted unsuccessfully to represent Pinmay and Vithobai's life together beyond the grave, but it is significant that, in fact, we never do get to see them beyond the grave (LC 237). Similarly, in Maurice, right at the beginning of the novel we learn that Maurice has lost his object of desire, the garden boy George. Once again, we begin with homoerotic desire already lying in the past. And the novel ends with Maurice slipping away into the darkness, "leaving no trace of his presence except a little pile of petals of the evening primrose, which mourned from the ground like expiring fire" (M 232). The image of the mourning petals like ex pired fire and the darkness link Maurice's disappearance into the greenwood with death. Again, Forster tells us in the Afterword to the novel that he tried to represent Maurice and Scudder's idyllic life in</page><page sequence="28">Stephen da Silva the greenwood, but he found himself unable to do so (250). So, we never get to see Maurice recover George and his past in the life be yond death in the greenwood.58 The tension in these texts between a homoerotic desire which has already occurred but does not enter representation and the promise of a future realization of that desire which Forster cannot seem to represent, as well as the insistent association of homosexual desire with death are eminently logical given the developmental narrative which Forster is both employing and inverting. In the developmental marriage plot, homosexuality is a stage that must be eliminated in order to progress to adulthood. So, it is no wonder homosexuality should be associated with death, or merely seen as an immature stage that lies somewhere in the past prior to the language and cul ture employed by fully adult heterosexual subjects. Within the (il)logic of this narrative, then, it is impossible for homosexuality to enter full representation. No doubt, Forster inverts the terms of the narrative to celebrate youthfulness and to celebrate the life beyond the grave, but he is ultimately unable to displace that narrative's terms. But if Forster is unable to displace the terms of a heterosexist de velopmental narrative, he does create limited friction within the de velopmental machinery that he employs. For instance, in many of the stories, he deploys empty repetition to undermine developmental logic.59 Perhaps the best example of this empty reversal of the devel opmental narrative occurs in the Afterwood to Maurice. On the face of it, Maurice seems to reach dialectical closure by moving forward through returning to England's past represented by the maternal greenwood. But in a 1960 "Afterword," Forster undermines the dia lectical telos of the story. The "Afterword" begins in the same nos talgic terms as the novel with Forster looking back enviously at the greenwood which is being destroyed by industrialism and capital ism, a greenwood which Maurice and Scudder could flee to but one that is not available to us. It ends, however, by undercutting Maurice and Scudder's escape from heterosexual culture and class difference by asserting that nothing has really changed, and the same cycle con tinues to be repeated: "police prosecutions will continue and Clive on the bench will continue to sentence Alec in the dock. Maurice may get off" (M 251). The repetition of the phrase "will continue" in those final sentences undermines any hope of closure. Similarly, in "The Life to Come," Lionel March's transgression and punishment emptily repeat those of his father: Lionel's father crossed racial boundaries by</page><page sequence="29">Male Homosexuality in Forster s Fiction 265 having an affair with a woman of color, and his transgression caused him to be deemed unspeakable by his family and culture. Lionel practices miscegenation with a man, rather than a woman, but in an empty repetition of his father's punishment, he is posthumously deemed unspeakable by his mother. Again, the past provides no way to escape the cycle of repetition. One way to provide this empty repe tition with some political content is to see it as an inversion of the heterosexist developmental plot: as we have seen, in the develop mental plot, the homosexual is seen as a deviant who endlessly re peats his immature pleasures, but in these texts it is normative culture that is represented as pathologically frozen in time, cease lessly and vengefully enforcing its prohibitions on crossing racial, class, and gendered lines. More politically useful than his use of repetition, however, is Fors ter's use of violent endings to undermine the developmental logic of his stories. Several critics have pointed out how many of the stories in The Life to Come end with brutal deaths. For instance, both "The Life to Come" and "The Other Boat" end with murders and suicides —Lionel kills himself and his lover Cocoanut in "The Other Boat" and Vithobai kills himself and Pinmay in "The Life to Come." I would suggest that one can read the violence in these stories as a self-reflexive comment on the murderously constraining limits of the plot which Forster is forced to employ. The heterosexist developmen tal plot erases homosexuality as a preliminary stage that must be eliminated on the way to the telos of heterosexual closure. But this violent erasure is effected with bland complacency—homosexuality must slip away into the darkness, giving way to heterosexuality, be cause that's the way things are. While the idyllic tone of Maurice's ending might eroticize the link between death and homosexuality, it does not uncover the heterosexist violence that sustains this link. By contrast, the hyperbolic, even sadistically pornographic, tone of the endings of stories such as "The Other Boat" and "The Life to Come" has the potential to uncover the violence and motivated desire that inform a heterosexist developmental plot. I use the phrase "has the potential" because as Colleen Lamos has pointed out, one can never predict the "multivalent," "contingent" political effects of irony or parody, and indeed those critics who read these endings simply as a symptom of Forster's self-hatred demonstrate the vulnerability of ironic attempts to undermine the norm.60 However, at least one po tential effect of these endings might be to disclose the complacent brutality of heterosexist developmental ideology. Indeed, I would</page><page sequence="30">Stephen da Silva suggest that Forster's violent endings have greater potential to do anti-homophobic work than his nostalgia, for a celebration of youth ful homosexual desire prior to or beyond culture offers very little po litical purchase to a struggle all too firmly situated within history. But beyond acting as a critique of a heterosexist developmental nar rative, the endings of the Forster texts also help tonally to enrich the Foucauldian formulation through which I have read them: while the endings of these texts support Foucault's insightful contention about the availability of the norm for anti-homophobic appropriation and resignification, their sensational violence salutarily dramatizes the toll and ambivalent pleasures which can be involved in such resistant strategies, affective complexities which the seemingly disinterested, self-assured tone of Foucault's formulation does not adequately illu minate.61 Rice University Notes I am indebted to Helena Michie, Colleen Lamos, Scott Derrick, Martine van Elke, Padmaja Challakere, and the anonymous reader from Criticism for com menting on various drafts of this essay. 1. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Between Men: English Literature and Male Hom osocial Desire (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985), theorizes the continuity between triangulated male homosocial and male homosexual de sire and describes the violent rupture that was effected between them in Anglo-American culture in the wake of the Wilde trials and the instantiation of the homo/heterosexual divide. The Structuralist model of mediated desire which Sedgwick both uses and historicizes is drawn from Rene Girard, De ceit, Desire, and the Novel: Self and Other in Literary Structure, trans. Yvonne Freccero (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1972). Part of the attraction of Mediterranean and Indian cultures for Forster is that he believes these cultures allow a seamless continuity between norma tive male homosocial and homosexual bonds. 2. E. M. Forster, Where Angels Fear to Tread (1905; Harmondsworth, Mid dlesex: Penguin English Library, 1984), 154, my emphasis. 3. Ibid., 149. My reading of the confrontation between Gino and Philip as a displaced representation of sodomy is indebted to Sedgwick's reading of similar scenes of violence between men in Our Mutual Friend (Between Men, chap. 9). 4. My description of Gino and Philip's struggle as irreducibly supple mentary to the conclusion of the novel relies on an understanding of the sup plement elaborated by Jacques Derrida, Of Grammatology, trans. Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976). In this text, Derrida theorizes that supplements call into question, or supplant,</page><page sequence="31">Male Homosexuality in Forster's Fiction 267 the seemingly self-contained structures to which they are supposedly ancil lary. Although the idiom through which I read Forster's posthumously pub lished work is more Foucauldian than Derridean, my argument implicitly maintains that Forster's posthumously published texts act as a supplement to the common critical developmental narrative describing his ouevre—that is, these works both constitute additions and fundamental challenges to the writer's body of work as it has usually been critically narrativized. 5. Michel Foucault, The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction, trans. Robert Hurley (New York: Vintage Press, 1976), 101. I use the pronoun "him" to describe "the homosexual" because Foucault's work is highly an drocentric and focuses exclusively on the male homosexual. Critics such as Jonathan Dollimore (Sexual Dissidents [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991], 48-55) and Esther Newton ("The Mythic Mannish Lesbian: Radclyffe Hall and the New Woman," in Hidden from History, ed. Martin Duberman, Martha Vicinus, and George Chauncey [New York: Meridian Books, 1990], 281-93), have examined how lesbian writers like Radclyffe Hall and Rita Mae Brown deployed reverse discourses of female homosexuality. 6. Foucault strenuously insists that one recognize the discontinuity of history. Genealogy, he tells us, unlike metaphysical paradigms of history, "does not restore an unbroken continuity" and "does not resemble the evolu tion of a species." It resists those models of history which would make "pre sent needs" the "origin" of the past ("Nietzsche, Genealogy, and History," in The Foucault Reader, ed. Paul Rabinow [New York: Pantheon Books, 1984], 81 and 83). 7.

The stereotypical association of the homosexual with immaturity endures and has taken a particularly ugly form in the hysteria surrounding AIDS—one common narrative portrays AIDS as a penalty visited upon a hedonistically immature generation of gay men forcing them to grow up and accept mature responsibility. The strategy that Thomas Yingling suggests to confront this narrative has obvious reso nances with at least one of the strategies Forster deploys: Yingling suggests that "it may be time to rethink homosexuality's claims to maturity" and to consider transvaluing the denigratory implications of immaturity instead</page><page sequence="32">Stephen da Silva ("Wittgenstein's Tumour: AIDS and the National Body," in Textual Practice 8.1 [spring 1994]; 110. 15.

For the most full and lucid theorization of such a position, see Barbara Herrn stein-Smith's Contingencies of Value (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988). In uncovering the heterosexist logic that informs some of the most common critical accounts of Forster's authorial development, I am not attempting to suggest that there can be a disinterested account of an author's career or the quality of her works, nor am I attempting to offer such an ac count. Like Herrnstein-Smith, I am convinced that aesthetic value judgments are inevitably informed by local, contingent interests. As a reader committed to anti-homophobic values, I am merely contesting those readings of Fors ter's work whose figurative and narrative logic draws on those values. 19. F. R. Leavis, "E. M. Forster," in The Common Pursuit (New York: George Stewart, 1952), 264 and 268. Subsequent references to the essays in this volume appear in the text within parentheses. 20. This is not the only place where Leavis feminizes Forster. Contemp tuously dismissing Forster's Clark Lectures, which were to become Aspects of the Novel, Leavis declared that "Forster's capacity audience consisted largely of sillier don's wives." He saw "the resultant book . . . fas] a nuisance" "since all the girls' school English mistresses in England seized on the dis tinction between flat and round characters." For Leavis, Forster's "intellec tual nullity" seems connected to his effeminacy, an effeminacy that is evidenced by the fact that he drew mainly women to his lectures and his ideas appealed mainly to schoolmistresses (F. R. Leavis, qtd. in Oliver Stal leybrass's introduction to E. M. Forster's Aspects of the Novel, Abinger Edition [London: Edwin Arnold, 1974], xi-xii). Ironically, certain defenders of Forster replicate the gendered terms of Leavis's dismissal of Forster. In a recent study that attempts to rehabilitate Forster's strain of liberalism as a precursor of current brands of pragmatism, Brian May opposes the "toughness and tenacity" shown by Forster's version of liberalism in its reaction to Modernism to the "precious, fey, and Wil dean" reaction that is usually associated with an enervated nineteenth-cen tury liberalism's response to Modernism (The Modernist as Pragmatist: E. M. Forster and the Tate of Liberalism [Columbia and London: University of Mis souri Press, 1997], 3). In order to restore Forster's reputation as a serious thinker, May predictably aligns him with qualities traditionally associated with virility, "toughness and tenacity," and distances him from the "fey" ef feminacy associated with inversion and the figure of Wilde. 21. In a Paris Review interview, Forster articulates his own lack of interest in developmental and degenerative accounts of authorial careers: "I am more interested in achievement than in advance on and decline from it. . . . The paternal wish of critics to show how a writer dropped off or picked up as he went along seems to me to be misplaced" (Interview [1953] with P. N. Fur</page><page sequence="33">Male Homosexuality in Forster's Fiction bank and F. J. H. Haskell, in Writers at Work, ed. Malcolm Cowley [New York: Viking Press, 1959] 34-35). Forster's use of the adjective "paternal" is particularly relevant to my reading of the critical developmental plot. Like good heterosexual patriarchs, many critics paternally (indeed, often paternal istically) dismiss those texts of Forster that thematize homosexuality as im mature distractions from his mature work, just as many heterosexual fathers dismiss their gay sons' desires as distractions from the path to heterosexual adulthood. While in this interview, Forster with heartening perversity rejects this organic, familial critical narrative as "misplaced," in his posthumously published texts, as we will see, he sometimes endorses or creates his own version of this narrative. 22.

For an alternative reading that sees "Arthur Snatchfold" as represent ing the postmodernist, as opposed to the Modernist, strain in Forster's writ ing, see Alan Wilde, Horizons of Assent: Modernism, Postmodernism, and the Ironic Imagination (Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1981), 66-71. For Wilde, what is important in Conway's and Snatch fold's encounter is its transitoriness, its lack of emotional depth. He sees the story as a celebration of surface and fragmented momentary experience as opposed to a Modernist aesthetics built around intersubjective relationships and characterological depth. In order to advance this reading, Wilde has to downplay the Romantic images of time and nature that so richly inform the story. These images suggest that Forster is not celebrating atomistic, frag mented postmodern surfaces but is invested in a Romantic pastoral myth of youthfulness and its link to nature. 40.

While my contention is that Forster partially transvalues the dis courses he employs, I would want to distance myself from some of the ex travagant claims that have been made for Forster's subversiveness, claims based purely on the fact that he was gay. Martin, for instance, moves from accurately describing Forster's perceptions of the egalitarian possibilities of male homosexuality—"it is clear that for Forster homosexuality can lead to a greater democracy of vision, to a violation of social, racial, and class bar riers"—to endorsing those perceptions uncritically—"Forster's homosexual ity made it easier for him to renounce the burdens of class that prevent his heterosexual characters from loving fully" (73). June Perry Levine makes a similarly sweeping claim for Forster's openness to alterity: "Forster is more of an outsider than we had realized. . . . Self-aware and self-critical, seeking to connect not only the prose and the passion but also the public and the pri vate, his art pays homage to the redemptive possibilities inherent in the love</page><page sequence="35">Male Homosexuality in Forster s Fiction 271 of the totally other, one who must be reached by stepping over the chasm of class or race" ("The Tame in Pursuit of the Savage: Posthumous Fiction of E. M. Forster," PMLA 99 [(January 1984): 87]. Apart from the extravagance of the "redemptive possibilities" that Perry-Levine sees to cross-class or cross racial homosexual relations, her formulation worrisomely resembles The Life to Come in mystifying non-Western and working-class people as "totally other." 48. Forster, Abinger Harvest, 3-4. 49. At a biographical level too, Forster seems to have enjoyed challenging and inverting the developmental narrative. For Forster, a crucially transfor mative moment occurred in his life when he met Mohammed el Adl, his Egyptian lover, and realized his physical desire for the first time. Writing to Florence Barger, he described this experience in terms of attaining adult hood: "It isn't happiness; it's rather (beastly phrase)—that I first feel a grown-up man" (Forster, quoted in P. N. Furbank, E. M. Forster, A Life: The Growth of a Novelist, 1879-1914 [London: Martin, Seeker, and Warburg, 1977], 40). Note how Forster both deploys the developmental narrative and dis tances himself from it by qualifying the term "grown-up man" with the par enthetical "beastly phrase." While el Adl allowed Forster to attain maturity, Furbank suggests that their erotic life was framed in terms of childlike fun: "In bed at night, they [Forster and el Adl] played the fool like children" (50). Both statements are consistent with Forster's inversion of the developmental narrative: in travelling away from the "adult" world of England to the "childlike pleasures" of el Adl and Egypt, Forster imagines paradoxically that he is able to become a "grown-up man." 50.

Turner, 125-27. 57. But the maternal occupies a complicatedly split position in Forster's mythology. On the one hand, Forster often represents the mother as enforcer of cultural prohibitions who thwarts the realization of male homosexual de sire. Thus, Mrs. March in "The Other Boat" is represented as the prohibitive voice of her son Lionel's conscience—"From the great blank country she in habited, came a voice condemning him [Lionel] and all her children for sin but condemning him most. There was no parleying with her—she was a voice" [LC 193]—and as a would-be castrator—"The scarf covered [Cocoan ut, Lionel's lover].

[LC 192], In this sense, his mythology is</page><page sequence="36">272 Stephen da Silva "gender separatist," to use Sedgwick's term (Epistemology of the Closet, 85 88), for it envisions male homosexual desire as being thwarted by the femin izing maternal constraints of the law. On the other hand, as we have seen, he also associates realizing male homosexual desire with a flight back to the maternal, chthonic powers of the greenwood. At a biographical level too, this split in Forster's figuring of the maternal is evident. He writes to his friend J. R. Ackerley, "Although my mother has been intermittently tiresome for the last thirty years, cramped and warped my genius, hindered my career, blocked and buggered up my house, and boycotted my beloved, I have to admit that she has provided a rich subsoil where I have been able to rest and grow" (Forster qtd. in Claude Summers, E. M. Forster [New York: Fredrick Ungar, 1983], 28). In this formulation, Forster both associates his mother with thwarting his homoerotic desires, which he figures in characteristically anal terms—her boycotting of his be loved is alliteratively linked to the blocking and buggering up of his house— and with providing him with a vitally generative "rich subsoil"—a phrase whose fecal connotations also indirectly evoke anal pleasure. Thus, in this description, Forster figures his mother both as an obstacle and a vital facilita tor to his homoerotic desires. 58. My focus here is on Forster's posthumously published texts. However, other texts of Forster, most famously A Passage to India, also dramatize the sense of homosexual desire as something which cannot be realized in the present but which is held out as a tantalizing, shadowy, ambivalent promise for the future. A Passage to India ends with Fielding and Aziz being sepa rated by the very landscape of India—'"Why can't we be friends now?' said [Fielding] holding [Aziz] affectionately. 'It's what I want, it's what you want.' But the horses didn't want it—they swerved apart, the earth didn't want it, sending up rocks through which riders must pass single file; the temples, the tank, the jail, the palace, the birds, the carrion, the Guest House . . . they didn't want it, they said in their hundred voices, 'No, not yet,' and the sky, 'No, not there'" (A Passage to India [1924; New York, London, San Diego: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1984], 322). 59. A distinction must be drawn between Forster's use of "empty" and meaningful repetition in these texts. As we have seen, there are places where repetition plays a meaningful, dialectical role, acting to recover and trans form the past—for instance, as discussed earlier, in "Ansell," by meeting his boyhood friend again, the narrator is able to return to a sublated state of their pastoral, boyhood union. In contrast to this meaningful repetition, there are other manifestations of endless, sterile repetition which lead to no resolu tion but which serve to challenge and invert the nostalgic and Utopian strain of Forster's mythology. 60.

In using Edwardian Forster to complicate the insights of postmodern Foucault, I am inverting a Whiggish, developmental model of intellectual history, a move which satisfyingly resonates with at least one strategy de ployed by Forster himself in his posthumously published texts.</page></plain_text>
