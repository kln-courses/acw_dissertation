<plain_text><page sequence="1">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE II. CRITICISM AND EXEGESIS 6 ANY SCIENCE is overcrowded with theories of more or less probability of which some are proved as facts and Qthers discarded as fiction. Theo- ries are the seeds of civilization which grow into facts, and without them there would be no growth and no progress in human development. The same holds true of biblical science. Our attitude against the critical views is not because of their destructive tendencies as being subversive of the traditional conceptions. We do not object to the documentary hypothesis as an hypothesis. We merely maintain that it still remains in an embryonic stage and has not yet developed into an incontrovertible fact which can serve as basis of all biblical studies. While the position of conservative scholars against it is not taken seriously, the denial of the documentary hypothesis by one of the foremost German critics must have come to the critical school as a bolt from the blue. We refer to Max L6hr's Untersuchungen zum Hexateuch. These studies consist of three parts. The first part is called Der Priesterkodex in der Genesis; the second, Das Ritual von Leviticus 16; and the third, Das Deuteronomium. The author's starting point is, that, as far as Genesis is concerned, it is an error to see in the Priestly Code an independent source of the Hex- ateuch. It is generally held that this documentary source originated among the Jewish exiles in Babylonia about 500, and was revised and expanded by a redactor (RP) about 100 years later. This revised docu- ment was worked into the Hexateuchal materials. It is further maintained that we are able to separate this Priestly source from all other sources of the Hexateuch with absolute certainty, not only by means of linguistic criteria characteristic of this priestly document, but also by its contents, and especially by its chronological notices and its Toledoth-superscrip- tions. The author admits that there can be no doubt that in many parts of Genesis we meet with a certain schematism both in form and contents. 6 Untersuchungen zum Hexateuchproblem. Von MAX LOHR, D. Dr. I.

Furthermore, it is very questionable whether the dates and similar matters should be assigned to this priestly document. Finally, it is more than doubtful whether it be permissible to separate passages assigned to P from their context, and to regard them as to their contents and arrangement as belonging to an independent document. In raising these doubts, the author indicates the essential points of his investigations. Firstly he deals with the linguistic usage and Toledoth- superscriptions, and secondly with the contents or the narrative mate- rials of the so-called Priestly Code in Genesis. He subjects the sections, passages, phrases, and words assigned to this priestly source to a minute investigation, and arrives at the conclusion, that those that are taken as characteristic of P must be assigned to later interpolators. We have neither space nor is there any need to give an outline of his arguments, and it is sufficient to present his conclusions. In denying the separate existence of the Priestly Code, he rejects the documentary theory on which all modern biblical studies are based. It is his contention that the whole Pentateuch, with the exception of the chronological net which is spread over Genesis, some chapters as 14, 34, 38, 49, and a great many glosses and changes in detail, was the work of Ezra and his associates in Babylon. He takes it for granted that Ezra had at his disposal a widely extensive and diverse literature dating from pre-exilic times. It consisted of sacrificial and ritualistic ordinances coming from more than one sanctuary. It contained also popular and scholarly traditions con- cerning the Patriarchs, which were of a secular, religious-political, priestly and theological character. Some of the Patriarch-narratives had already been combined into cycles, as those of Abraham-Lot, Jacob-Laban, and the presentation of Joseph in Egypt. There were also found traditions concerning the divine promises as to the possession of the land of Canaan, genealogical tables, and scholarly treatises, as the stories of Creation, deluge, etc. All these materials Ezra collected and revised for the use of the restored community of Jahveh and His service on the sacred soil in the land of their fathers. The author contends that it is more natural to presuppose that these diverse materials of Genesis, in the main at least, were put together by one man and his associates, according to a certain design and purpose, than is the assumption of a very complicated process of joining together a series of independent sources. He points out that the documentary</page><page sequence="3">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 323 hypothesis digs its own grave by the presumption that the sources them- selves do not constitute a unity, as for the existence of each source and its combination with the others it needs an army of redactors, who are not infrequently charged with a deficient mentality, in order to explain the composition of the Mosaic books. Now from these premises it would seem that it is the author's con- tention that Ezra in his composition of the Pentateuch used exclusively pre-exilic materials and added nothing of his own, neither of exilic or post-exilic origin. This would constitute a complete departure from the current critical views. But this is by no means the case, as the author credits Ezra with the so-called first account of Creation and its com- bination with the Sabbath-idea, and with a number of other sections (p. 3 f). This view is based on an historical conception which is generally held by the modern critics of the Wellhausen school. However, the author clearly states that this is his opinion, and if we do not share this historical conception we are at liberty to reject it, as he did not arrive at it on the basis of his criteria or his arguments. The latter merely demonstrate that Ezra was the editor and reviser of the pre-exilic litera- ture, but does not throw any light on the question of his own contribu- tion to the composition of the Pentateuch. As a matter of fact, the author is far from being conservative in his arguments and his strictures will find recognition only among those who believe in modern criticism. He surely goes too far in seeing in Genesis 49 a post-Ezraic addition, which would imply that the Blessing of Jacob dates from a late post- exilic period. The same is true of Genesis 38 in which he sees an insertion later than Ezra's composition of the Pentateuch. We cannot see any reason for such a view. However, though the author must not be classed with the conserva- tive scholars, he has done a great service to biblical scholarship in a conservative direction, in having demonstrated the fallacy of the docu- mentary hypothesis, and proving thereby that modern biblical critics are on the wrong track in making it the starting point of all biblical researches. Though his own constructive attempts may or may not be satisfactory, his investigations are exceedingly valuable. Their results may pave the way for seeking other solutions of the problem without being hampered at every step by the fundamental assumptions of mod- ern criticism. Moreover, while modern critics consistently ignore views of conservative scholars who deny the validity of the critical premises, they will have to take into account investigations of a critic who refutes the documentary hypothesis from a severely critical point of view.</page><page sequence="4">324 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The second part of his Untersuchungen deals with the ritual of Levit- icus 16. This chapter contains the ordinances for the Day of Atone'ment, and it is generally held by modern critics that its enactment is of post- exilic origin. In this part also the author bases some of his results upon vague hyper-modern theories (cf. p. 8f). He submits every verse and almost every word of this chapter to a rigid investigation, which, how- ever, for one who does not subscribe to the critical premises on which it is founded will not be of much force. We are merely concerned with the author's conclusions concerning the pre-exilic origin of the Day of Atonement. Also on this point his investigations tend to conform to ancient tradition, though his own view that the Ritual of Leviticus 16 in the present form is post-Ezraic is far from traditional. As to the third part that deals with Deuteronomy, the problem under consideration is to find out the contents of the original Book of the Law and to separate it from the later additions which are now extant in the canonical book of Deuteronomy. Modern research in referring to the original book has in mind the Book of the Law discovered under the reign of Josiah. However, it has been objected that it is wrong to apply the term original to that Book of the Law, as it could be applied only to the original sources from which it was composed. True, according to Wellhausen and his followers who hold that the discovery of that Book was merely a pious fraud, and that it was actually composed at the time of its pretended discovery, the term original is justified. But Holscher in recent years has given biblical research quite a new direction, in deny- ing the identity of Deuteronomy with the discovered Book of the Law (ZA TW 1922, 189ff). On account of its ideological character he assigns it to about 500 B. c. E. This view on the whole is concurred in by Horst (ZDMG, 1923, p. 220), who sees in the historical record of the discovery of the Book of the Law a post-exilic revision of the original record which dealt only with Josiah's reforms. Thus the narrative which makes Deu- teronomy the instrument of Josiah's reforms is a post-exilic invention. The author then investigates the two problems which are of funda- mental importance: the historical character of the record of 2 Kings 22, as to the discovery of the Book of the Law; and if its historicity be admitted, whether there is any possibility of separating the original parts from the present Book of Deuteronomy. On the first question, the author is fully in agreement with Gunkel, who declared: "If this is not an absolutely authentic tradition, there is none!"-A poor argu- ment for modern critics!-However, he admits that this record contains later additions, which do not affect the main fact, the record of the dis-</page><page sequence="5">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 325 covery of the Book of the Law. With regard to the second question, the author enters into a minute and laborious examination of the con- tents of the discovered Book, concerning which he is fully in agreement with the Wellhausen school, that in the main it is identical with Deu- teronomy chapters 12-26. Also in this part of his investigations he is rigidly critical, and innumerable phrases and passages are discarded as later additions. The author arrives at the conclusion that, if the original book of Deu- teronomy claims to be of Mosaic authorship, there is no reason for reject- ing this claim. He points out, that modern critics are wrong in seeing in the ordinances of Deuteronomy a complete overthrow of existing conditions, and therefore it is an error to argue that such an overthrow could not be expected in a pre-exilic period. Furthermore, we must bear in mind, that the priestly ordinances could not be effected in practice, and remained purely theoretical, though dating from a Mosaic period. Finally, there is a whole series of ordinances which could be understood only, if intended for a commonwealth living together within a small space, and the Book of Deuteronomy was the law-book of Judah and of the clans connected with it. As the present writer does not recognize the premises underlying the arguments concerning Deuteronomy, as he denies its identity with the discovered Book of the Law, in which he sees a priestly manual for the instruction of the priesthood containing all the known traditions and ordinances of the pre-Mosaic, Mosaic, and post Mosaic periods, he cannot accept either of the two divergent views. But it may be observed that there is one important point which the author has overlooked in his arguments. The contention which identifies the discovered Book of the Law with Deuteronomy rests on' the centralization of the cult undertaken by Josiah immediately after its discovery. But if the author is right in declaring that the ordinances of Deuteronomy, including those of the centralization of the sanctuary had been well known and funda- mental in Israel's religion from the Mosaic period, at least as far as Judah was concerned, what evidence is there for identifying the discovered Book with Deuteronomy? If the author had accepted the documentary hypothesis, he would have had a cogent reason for such an identification, as it would account for the existence of Deuteronomy. He might justly have contended that the discovered book was neither the Elohistic nor Jahvistic document. Seeing, however, that the author denies the exis- tence of these documents, why not assume that it was one of the Toroth that Ezra used for the composition of the Pentateuch? The fact that</page><page sequence="6">326 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the laws found in Deuteronomy are ancient is no proof for such an iden- tification, considering that the author admits the antiquity of many priestly ordinances found in the so-called Priestly Code, and neverthe- less ascribes their codification to a post-exilic period. However, whether this identification is right or wrong, is of secondary consideration. The most important fact is, that the author notwith- standing his critical position, arrived at the conclusion, that the laws of Deuteronomy date from a very early period, and that we have no rea- son for doubting their Mosaic origin. This is a vindication of conserva- tive scholarship which consistently rejected the critical views as to the late origin of Deuteronomy. But as a matter of curiosity, we would like to know the author's position with regard to the composition of the historical Books of Judges, Samuel, and Kings. It is the consensus of modern critics that these Books were written from a Deuteronomistic point of view, and therefore their composition in the present form must be assigned to a post-Deuteronomistic period. But the author contends that the laws of Deuteronomy date from an early period, and they must have been well known to the spiritual leaders of Judah centuries before the discovery of the Book of the Law. If so, we have no longer this criterion whereby to decide the date of the composition of these his- torical Books, and the Deuteronomistic views found in them might antedate the discovery of the Book of the Law. As to references to later events found in them, they cannot be regarded as an absolute criterion, as they might be ascribed to late glossators. 7 In connection with the discussion of these critical problems we may consider Meinhold's Einfiihrung in das Alte Testament, which claims to be a thoroughly revised edition of the author's work reviewed in this Quarterly (XVI, 1926, pp. 423-428). But there is scarcely any modifica- tion of the views expressed in the former edition, and the revision con- sists only in discussing the literature accumulated during the years that' elapsed between the two editions and in taking issue with different views, which of course enhances its value. Hence there is no need for present- ing the author's views and discussing them, as our judgment concerning his work remains the same, that from a critical point of view it is a prom- inent contribution to Old Testament textbooks, though we reject its critical premises and take exception to most of its conclusions. 7 Einfiihrung in das Alte Testament. Von D. JOHANNES MEINHOLD. Zweite v6llig neubearbeitete Auflage. (Sammlung Topelmann. Die Theologie in A briss, Band I). Giessen: VERLAG VON ALFRED TOPEL- MANN, 1926. Pp. viii+350.</page><page sequence="7">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 327 However, there are some points that we cannot let pass. In our review of the former edition, we objected to the starting point of the author, that the Book of Deuteronomy was the first Lawbook produced by the disciples of the prophets, and this constituted Israel's first "Sacred Writings." He of course identifies Deuteronomy with the Book of the Law discovered under the reign of Josiah. But on this point, he was bound to come into collision with the contentions of Holscher and Horst concerning the date of the composition of Deuteronomy as being about 500 B. C. E. However, the author is not much disturbed by these views, observing: "Whatever position we may adopt toward these recent con- tentions, the fact still remains that with the Jewish congregation "Sacred Writings" came into existence, and the first Lawbook of the congregation was Deuteronomy" (p. 9). But the matter is not so simple, as the author would have us believe, if we seriously consider these views. In assuming that Deuteronomy is identical with the Book of the Law discovered under the reign of Josiah, there is good reason why it should have found general recognition as a Lawbook, since it was accepted by the Judeans in a solemn covenant, as stated 2 Kings 23, 3. But if its composition dates from about 500 B. C. E., where is the evidence, that the Jewish congrega- tion submitted to its authority and recognised it as their Book of the Law? Such a recognition could be effected only in a solemn assembly of the whole congregation, and there is no biblical record to that effect. Surely the author would not imply that the Lawbook of Ezra was Deu- teronomy, as in Nehemiah 10, 31; 13, 1-2 there are references to laws which are found only in Deuteronomy. Furthermore, according to the author, the Law of Holiness (Lev. 17-26) in the main originated during the exile (p. 246). Thus if he does not object to H6lscher's contention, this legislation preceded the composition of Deuteronomy, and it might just as well have been the first "Sacred Writings" of the Jewish con- gregation. Finally, in accordance with this date of Deuteronomy, the Deuteronomistic School would have to be placed within the half century that intervened between 500 and Ezra's proclamation of the Pentateuch; and to this period must be assigned also the revision of the historical Books of Judges, Samuel, and Kings. In the present form these are written from a Deuteronomistic religious conception, as critics generally contend, and this would be contrary to the author's dates and exposition of this historical literature. As a matter of fact, Holscher undermines the whole critical edifice and makes all the introductions to the Old Testament and a good many modern biblical commentaries obsolete. This would hold true also of this work, if the author should not emphati-</page><page sequence="8">328 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW cally reject his views. We may notice by the way, that the date of Deuteronomy is not the only point of divergence between Holscher and the current criticism. In his contribution to Gunkelfestschrift 1923, p. 156ff, Holscher went still further in denying the pre-exilic origin of the Elohistic document asserting that it must be assigned to the exilic period. It goes without saying that the possibility of such a view is bound to turn present biblical criticism, exegesis, and history, topsy-turvy. The present reviewer has already pointed out that modern criticism would force us to assign not only Elohistic writings but also those of the Jahvist, partly at least, to an exilic or post-exilic period. Considering the unsta- ble character of modern biblical criticism, the view of Lohr who denies the truth of the documentary hypothesis, and those of Holscher who assigns D and E to exilic and post-exilic periods, conservative scholarship is justified in turning its back upon vague and fluctuating hypotheses and disregarding them in its biblical exposition. There is also another point to which we may call attention. In dis- cussing the commandment of circumcision (p. 428), the author evidently disregards the fact that even according to P (Gen. 17), this is not a Mosaic commandment, but dates from a pre-Mosaic period, and is obligatory on all the descendants of Abraham and Isaac, including the Ishmaelites, the sons of Keturah, and the Edomites. We have seen that Kittel also regards circumcision as pre-Mosaic. Therefore the whole discussion as to, why circumcision is not presented as a sign of the covenant by Ezekiel or in the Decalogue, is gratuitous. How could it be such a sign, if it was not especially characteristic of Israel but is shared by the whole race of Abraham? If we accept the Kenite hypothesis, we must assume that this rite was practised also by the Kenites as descen- dants of Abraham. As a matter of fact, circumcision was not even by the Rabbis, declared as a Sacrament, as the author expresses himself, seeing that it is not incumbent upon one whose two brothers died on account of having been circumcised. Nevertheless such a man is regarded as an Israelite in every respect, with the exception of not being permitted to eat of the paschal lamb. 8 A novel and more satisfactory solution of the problem of Deuteronomy is proposed by Welch in his book entitled The Code of Deuteronomy (A New Theory of its Origin). The introductory chapter contains an account of the history of this problem in modern times which is exceedingly inter- esting and instructive, as it discusses also the various difficulties encoun- 8 The Code of Deuteronomy (A New Theory of its Origin). By ADAM C. WELCH, D. D. London: JAMES CLARKE &amp; LTD., [1924] Pp. 224.</page><page sequence="9">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 329 tered in the acceptance of any of the proposed attempts at its solution. After reviewing the current position of the critics that the Book of Deu- teronomy, apart from later post-exilic additions, was the programme for the centralization of Israel's cult, the author enters into a discussion of the new movement that has arisen in connection with it, which insists that certain laws included in Deuteronomy must be of post-exilic origin. This movement is to be seen in Britain by Kennet in his book Deuteronomy and the Decalogue, in America by Perry (JBL 1921), and in Germany by Holscher, the most thoroughgoing advocate of this position who has submitted the entire Code to an exhaustive examination. He observes, that the mere fact that the question has sprung up in all three quarters, serves at least to demonstrate that the problem of Deuteronomy is far from being satisfactorily settled. Since that question is the corner-stone of a certain school of modern criticism of the Old Testament, the signif- icance of such a recognition cannot be overestimated. However, we may note, in passing, that Holscher's main contention that many of the laws of Deuteronomy imposed upon the worshippers were demands which it was impossible to carry out, when Jerusalem was erected into the sole legitimitate shrine for the country, is essentially wrong. It will be generally granted, that the Deuteronomistic ordinances concerning tithes, harvest-festivals, and firstlings, which are specifically singled out to prove this point, were strictly observed by the pious Jews during the second commonwealth. If they had found insurmountable difficulties to comply with them, they would have been modified by the spiritual leaders, and there would be traces of such modifications in the Rabbinic literature, in the Tractates dealing with these matters. Surely the conditions of the post-exilic Jews in Palestine were not different from those of the first commonwealth. Therefore it is preposterous to maintain that Deuteronomy contains demands which could not be observed by those who were willing to accept the divine commandments. This argument is on a par with the belief prevailing among non-Jewish scholars from the beginning of Christianity to the present that the Jews are so overwhelmingly oppressed by the intolerable yoke of the Law that it kills all their joy-a charge to which Kittel in the book reviewed above takes exception (p. 192). It is simply incredible that during an era of nineteen hundred years this fable should have maintained itself, and no scholar should ever have tried to convince himself of its truth until the advent of Kittel. It is likewise a fundamental error to assert that the law about the king was impossible at the time when the kingdom was still in existence. The prophets did not hesitate in the least to con-</page><page sequence="10">330 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW demn wrong actions of the kings and to predict their downfall, and legislators should have feared to promulgate laws which imposed restric- tions upon the kings, laws which were supposed to antedate the rise of the monarchy in Israel, and for which, according. to this claim, they could not be held responsible. Is it conceivable that the most pious king Josiah should have felt insulted by such laws? Thus the contention that Deuteronomy contains laws which could never be carried into effect has no leg to stand upon! One might just as well maintain that the dietary laws are absurd and unworkable, and nevertheless they were rigidly observed by religious Jews for two millenniums and a half, and the same holds true of numerous other biblical laws. It is the author's view that there is need for a re-examination of the current -critical position that Deuteronomy was written to insist on centralization of the cult. It is necessary again to ask, what were the controlling principles which guided the legislators who laid down the laws which appear in chapters 12-26 of the Book of Deuteronomy? Was the aim of that Code to enforce centralization of the worship? Were the laws even revised with this purpose in view? It is possible, he says, that the practical difficulties which attend the laws only arise so long as we obstinately refuse to think it possible that these laws never aimed at a solitary altar. The aim of the present work is to attempt such an examination. The laws are passed in review without any effort to interpret them in con- nection with Josiah's reform, but with the desire to see exactly what they demand. For such an examination the laws that have nothing to do with the cult, and nothing to say on the question of its centralization, are entirely passed over. The remaining laws are roughly grouped to- gether. First come those which deal directly with the cult, and which at once raise the question, whether they aim at centralization. Then comes another series of laws which, while they are not directly concerned with the cult, are concerned with the priests, the judges, etc., whose functions are supposed to have been changed by the reform of 621. Again there are several laws, like that of the king, which do not concern themselves with the cult or its personel, and which have not been mod- ified by the reform of the centralization, but which have been strongly pressed as proving the post-exilic character of the whole Code. In the examination of the various laws, the author shows not only good scholarship, but also sound, practical sense, and an unbiased mind would readily accept his conclusions that these laws never aimed at centralization of the cult. We may even go a step further than the author</page><page sequence="11">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 331 and doubt whether centralization was intended in Deuteronomy 12, 1-7, concerning which he asserts that this section definitely and uncompro- misingly orders the centralization of the cult and ascribes it to a later period (p. 58). Nor it is necessary to assume that the writer of the law takes the attitude of the last revision of the Book of Joshua, according to which Canaan was overrun and conquered by united Israel in one or two campaigns, and thereafter the land from Lebanon to Negeb was distributed among the tribes. Even if that were the case, it is daring to assert that this conception is unhistorical. The changing attitude of scholars toward the historical character of Deuteronomy, hitherto the corner-stone in modern biblical history, ought to serve as a warning not to impugn a biblical tradition on account of critical hypotheses. Who knows whether the two different traditions concerning the conquest of Canaan, as found in the Books of Joshua and Judges, do not record events of different periods? It is the contention of the present writer that this is possible as soon as we assign the Exodus to the 14th century, after the death of Amenophis-Iknaton, when Egypt was in a state of anarchy and had lost all influence in the Syrian provinces. 'Israel, in accordance with biblical traditions may have entered Canaan 40 years later. This country inhabited by a heterogeneous population, consisting of native Semites, Hittites, and .Habiri, (the latter may well have been closely related to the Israelites and may have made common cause with them), they may have fallen an easy prey to the invaders as far as the open land was concerned. However, during the Egyptian-Hittite war, which lasted about eight years, the native population, especially the Hittites strengthened by the Hittite invaders from Asia Minor, asserted themselves and overthrew the Israelitish invaders. Those who had settled in the North may have been partly destroyed and partly sub- jected, while the southern tribes Judah and Simeon, withdrew to the desert.' They had to reconquer their former possessions after the Egyp- tian-Hittite war was over. We may thus assume that the Book of Joshua, being of Ephraimitic origin, contains traditions of the first conquest, while the Book of the Judges presents an account of the second conquest, when the southern tribes reconquered their territory. This conception is contrary to all critical hypotheses, but in the light of history may nevertheless be true. However, we have no quarrel with the author if he is still influenced by the current criticism, as he himself admits: "It is not easy to be quite unbiased in an effort which goes counter to the work of a generation" (p. 21). It is noteworthy that, while both L6hr and Welch reject the critical</page><page sequence="12">332 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW position on the laws of Deuteronomy, they differ diametrically on the law of the centralization of the cult, which the former regards as a pos- tulate of the Mosaic religion and finds the same tendency in the old laws of Ex. 34, 23.26; 23, 14-19; the latter, however, assigns its origin to the period of Josiah's reform. There is another difference in their conclusions. According to L6hr, the Book of Deuteronomy was the ancient Lawbook of Judah, while our author maintains: "The Deuteronomic Code is the outcome and one expression of that religious and national movement which rose in Benjamin and Ephraim, and which in its beginning is associated with the personality of Samuel" (p. 206); and he further observes: "And the Deuteronomic Code which is the outcome of the same movement always brings the student back to northern Israel" (p. 209). Accordingly, they differ also on the date of these laws. Lohr has not the least objection to one who would insist upon their Mosaic origin, while our author maintains that they date from the period of Samuel. Thus if we should rely on the authority of both these scholars, we would be justified in seeing in Deuteronomy a Mosaic Lawbook recognized by both Judah and Ephraim. However, while we may take exception to not a few of the author's views, justice demands the statement, that he has produced an excellent work, crowded with a host of original ideas and sound suggestions. In this respect it differs from many other literary productions of recent years, which on the whole re-hash critical views generally known to biblical students, and seldom contain ideas that possess originality. This is due to the fact that their authors do not dare run counter to the current critical views, as they fear that their literary labor would be buried in the library and none would read it. While our author on the whole is not hampered by such considerations. 9 Though current criticism still maintains its sway in biblical research, and studies that do not comply with this standard are looked upon with disdain and are on the whole ignored, here and there we meet with dis- senting voices which protest against its tyrannical dictum. Such a pro- test is voiced in Wieser's study Zur Literarkritik des Buches der Richter, which appeared in the Beitrdge zur Wissenschaft von Alten und Neuen Testament. In the introduction, the author discusses this question, in referring to the edict of the late Hugo Gressmann, in his essay Die Auf- 9 Zur Literarkritik des Buches der Richter. Von KURT WIESE (Beitrdge zur Wissenschaft vom Alten und Neuen Testament, herausgegeben von Rudolph Kittel, Dritte Folge, Heft 4). Stuttgart: W. KOHLHAMMER, 1926.

Hempel, however, in his review of this essay, rightly took exception to this statement, observing that the pronouncement is more characteristic of the unsci- entific attitude of the author than of those who reject the documentary hypothesis. The latter, who is a firm follower of Wellhausen, cannot help admitting, that all those who object to this critical position must be taken seriously and ought to be given at least a hearing, provided that they operate with scientific arguments. He cannot close his eyes to the fact that the results of Old Testament research on this position are badly in need of revision. A survey of the commentaries and special investigations with regard to the views on the separation of the sources shows considerable differences of opinion and a certain reserve in their conclusions. As for instance, in the assignment to J and E, there are in the evaluation of the specific arguments bewildering differences. The common ground is too small to point to as absolutely certain and that it must be objectively and generally recognized as a final result. The specific arguments which on the whole are purely of a linguistic nature are far insufficient to be taken as the characteristic marks of an author or of a school. It is the author's contention that biblical criticism has not succeeded in pointing out peculiarly literary formations and certain modes of thought which would be actually and exclusively characteristic of the several sources. On the contrary, any attempt in this direction, as that of Eissfeldt in his Hexateuch-Synopse and that of Judges, must be pronounced without any exaggeration as a complete failure. Voltz in his reivew of Eissfeldt's book rightly observes: "I see in this Synopse the end of the prevailing method, and find that it proves the contrary of what it intended to prove, as the paltry scraps of narratives placed in separate columns clearly demonstrate, that four original narratives never existed, and that this whole Synopse of the Hexateuch is the artificial product of modern scholarship.-The present writer in his review of Eissfeldt's book in this Quarterly (XVI, pp. 451-455), arrived at exactly the same conclusion-. We dwell on this point, because the view generally prevails among American and English biblical students, that "modern scholarship," and especially its position toward the docu- mentary hypothesis is the last word in biblical studies. It might interest them to see what a German critic has to say about this matter, though the study under consideration does not deal with the Pentateuch but with the Book of Judges.</page><page sequence="14">334 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The most prominent exponents of biblical criticism like Budde, Cornill, etc., maintain that the work of J and E is continued in the Books of Judges, Samuel, and Kings, which, however, is emphatically denied by Kittel in his Geschichte des Volkes Israel (II 6.7., p. 293f), and other scholars. It is the latter thesis which is defended by the author in his study, in subjecting each narrative of the Book of the Judges to a text- critical analysis, demonstrating by this method the uniform character of the tribal narratives which were purely of a secular nature, which have nothing in common with the J and E sources. The investigation which consists of technical details is of interest only for biblical scholars, and there is no need for entering into a discussion of it. It is sufficient to point out, that we have in this study an important contribution to the exegesis of the Book of the Judges. 10 The same issue of the Periodical in which the preceding study is published contains also a profound investigation of Ezekiel's visions, entitled Ezechielstudien by Spank. This prophet, in comparison with other prophets, is not held in high estimation by biblical scholars, due to his attitude toward rituals and sacrifices. It is a favorite pastime with a good many writers on biblical subjects to emphasize the low religious conception of the Jewish religion based on the Pentateuch in which morals and rituals are placed on the same level as being equally obligatory and to point out its inferiority, if compared with the religion of the prophets which was exclusively of a moral nature. They are bound to look askance at the prophet Ezekiel who considers morals and rituals equally binding and whose religious conception was identical with the Jewish religion. His very existence renders their argument illusory. The only way out of the dilemma is to deprive him of his prophetic rank. It is maintained that his book was a purely literary production, and he was not a speaking prophet like the others. The same view is held also concerning his visions, that they are not to be ascribed to a religious experience as are those of the other prophets who believed in the reality of their theophanies, but are pure ifiventions. It has been asserted that in comparison with the visions of Isaiah and Jeremiah his visions show a strongly pseudepigraphic character, as they are described to the small- est detail. The author takes issue with this view, in declaring that the vision of Ezekiel in its original form can stand comparison with those 1o Ezechielstudien.

The point that the author sets out to prove is of high importance, as the contention that Ezekiel was not a true prophet rests on his visions. The author arrives at his conclusion by a text-critical examination of every word and every verse of Ezekiel's visions, and on numerous points argues against many scholars who have been working on this subject, and especially against H6lscher in his book Hezekiel, der Dichter und das Buch, whom he charges with being one-sided in deal- ing with the problems concerning the personality of the prophet, and completely disregarding psychological problems in his deductions. The author holds that Ezekiel's visions contain numerous glosses and interpolations. To them must be ascribed all the minute details found in the present text, and the simple and grand character of Ezekiel's vision will appear, if they are eliminated. It might be of interest for students to see the original form of Ezekiel's theophany as reconstructed by the author, who cuts out more than three quarters of the present text. It would read as follows: "And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud and flashing fire; and out of its midst came four beings. This was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man. Every one of the four had a face and every one of them had four wings: all four had the face of a man, and two wings were stretched upward, so that two wings of every one were joined one to another and two covered their bodies. And between the Beings there was an appear- ance like coals of fire, and there was brightness to the fire, and out of the fire went forth lightnings. And over the heads of the Beings, there was the likeness of a firmament, like the color of crystal, and above the firmament was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was the like- ness of a man. And I saw like the color of electrum from the appear- ance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him. As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the bright- ness round about, And I saw and fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one who spake." This reconstructed text has one distinct advantage over the original that it eliminates the theriomorphic features in this theophany and it becomes purely anthropomorphic, and there is no reason any more to</page><page sequence="16">336 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW see Babylonian influence in this vision of Ezekiel. However, it is some- what difficult to believe that the original text was so profusely incrusted with interpolations and glosses, as it would be an isolated phenomenon in Old Testament writings, that the glosses and interpolations should be three times as large as the original text. Nevertheless, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that insurmountable difficulties are encountered in the exegesis of this vision, and the author's interpretation will have to be taken into consideration in the investigation of this subject. "While the reputation of modern critics as liberal scholars will not be impugned, if they act intolerantly toward the studies of conservative scholars in ignoring their views, the latter do not possess the same license to ignore modern criticism, as they would expose themselves to the charge of being intolerant, reactionaries and obscurantists, and there- fore must be thoroughly acquainted with all the critical views and well versed in the history of Biblical criticism. An exceedingly useful work and worthy of recommendation to those who are desirous of making themselves acquainted with this subject is Gray's Old Testament Criticism. It presents the history of biblical criticism, its rise and progress from the second century to the eighteenth c. E. Of special interest is the first part which deals with Patristic criticism, at the beginnings of Christianity. This is a subject little known and scantily touched upon in the textbooks on biblical criticism. The author is perfectly correct in dwelling upon the fact that biblical criticism, as far as the question of the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch is concerned, is by no means of recent date, but goes back to the beginnings of Christianity. However, we regret to find that he omitted to point out the reason of its origin, which was theological rather than literary or critical. The fundamental idea underlying the Pentateuchal problem in the early Christian Church was that any doctrine which did not square with the teachings of the Founder of Christianity cannot be true. But as a matter of fact, the latter did repudiate the Mosaic ceremonial and ritual laws. It was, therefore, argued, that if these laws had been commanded by the Godhead, Jesus who was the incarnation of it could not have contradicted himself in repudiating his own laws. It is well known that it was a moot question in the early Christian Church whether the Mosaic Law was obligatory on a Jewish convert to the Christian creed.

Pp. 252.</page><page sequence="17">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 337 venient way out of this dilemma was to deny the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch. This denial was supported by literary evidence, in pointing out that the Pentateuch recorded the death of Moses. This was the conception of the Jewish-Christian sect of the Ebionites, which observed Sabbath, circumcision, and several other Jewish precepts, and accordingly was vitally interested in the question whether the Mosaic laws were still binding for Jews who had embraced Christianity. A confirmation of this view was found in the Apocryphal Fourth Book of Ezra, where it is stated that all the Books of the Old Testament had been lost with the destruction of Jerusalem, and were rewritten by Ezra. Now the very existence of this legend in a work produced by a Jew leaves no room for doubt, that even before the rise of Christianity there were Jewish scholars who denied the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch and assigned it to Ezra, though holding that the latter was divinely inspired to reproduce it just as it was originally written by Moses. There may have been others of a sceptical turn of mind who doubted the exactitude of this reproduction. Thus it was easy for the Jewish Gnostics to go a step further, in seeing a core of truth in this apocryphal legend, that the Mosaic Books were written by Ezra, but denying that he was inspired to the extent of having reproduced them exactly in the original form and not having added to their conrtents'anything of his own or of post-Mosaic origin. This contention they could easily support by the record of Moses' death found in the Pentateuch which could not have been written by Moses himself. Their belief was that only that part of the Pentateuch was of Mosaic authorship, and consequently of divine origin, which was approved by the Founder of Christianity, while the rest consisted of materials for which Moses was not responsible. As a matter of fact, this criterion has not yet lost its force, and we meet with it frequently, though in veiled form and in a modern phraseology. However, while we heartily recommend this work as the best textbook on the history of biblical criticism, and hope soon to see the second part which is intended to deal with that of the 19th century to the present, there is one point to which we decidedly take exception. It is a regret- able error to say that the modern student is confronted with the respon- sibility of deciding for himself, whether to abide by the ancient tradition that the Pentateuch was written entirely or nearly so by Moses at the command and under the direct inspiration, even dictation of God Him- self or to accept the standpoint of modern criticism that the great law- giver contributed but little, if anything at all, to its contents (see pp. 2-3). He ought to know that there is a middle way between these two</page><page sequence="18">338 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW extreme views which is traversed by numerous moderate and conserva- tive critics. Such a view is misleading in forcing upon the modern student the acceptance of one of two extreme views, and he would naturally be inclined to side with radical criticism. Furthermore, does the author not know that the belief in verbal inspiration is shared by very few con- servative or orthodox scholars who believe in the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, and it is not even insisted upon by the Catholic Church? By such rash assertions the reader is at once prejudiced in favor of the most radical tendencies and has no longer a free mind to choose one or the other view. The growth of adherents to the radical tendencies is for the most part due to propaganda of that sort and not to its con- vincing character. However, this may have been a slip of the pen on the part of the author, and does not detract from the value of his pre- sentation of the history of Old Testament criticism. I2 That there are some curious notions with regard to the belief in inspiration may be seen also in Martin's book, The Meaning of the Old Testament (According to Modern Scholarship), which devotes a full chap- ter to the discussion and definition of this conception. The author states that his book does not pretend to be a complete introduction to the Old Testament, but aspires only to being a guide to the main results of modern scholarship, and it was written throughout with those in mind who know nothing at all about theology or biblical scholarship. We may add that it is likewise written from a thoroughly Christian point of view, being intended for Christian readers, and he continually quotes the New Test- ament in support of his conclusions. This is especially the case in the first chapter, entitled The Inspiration of the Bible. However, while the author's definition of biblical inspiration may express good Christian doctrine, it is more than questionable whether it can be brought in line with modern scholarship which discards such a conception altogether. In his definition he has failed to perceive that inspiration is limited to those parts of the Old Testament that claims to give divine utterances, and not to historical narratives, and is limited to the prophets, and not to the compilers of their prophecies. There is no reason to assume that these scribes ever claimed to have been inspired in their work of compil- ing the biblical literature. Ezra, as we know, never put forth the claim of having been an inspired prophet in the Old Testament Book that bears his name, though he is given prophetic rank in the apocryphal 12 The Meaning of the Old Testament (According to Modern Scholar- ship). By HUGH MARTIN, M. A. London: STUDENT CHRISTIAN MOVE- MENT, 1919. Pp. 168.</page><page sequence="19">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 339 books assigned to his authorship. The only qualifications with which these scribes ought to be credited, that they were honest and accurate in their compilations, and that they did not falsify the words of the prophets, in putting in their writings utterances they never expressed, are denied to them by "modern scholarship," and this view is funda- mental in biblical criticism. The title of the book sufficiently indicates its tendency and defines its scope, and there is no need to dwell on its contents. The views ex- pressed are those generally held by believers in the documentary hypoth- esis and are far from being radical. But the term "modern scholarship" is of a relative character, and we may doubt whether Meinhold and other radical scholars would approve its application to the author's exposition. It is true, their own literary productions may share the same fate of becoming obsolete, if L6hr or Holscher should have their way. But to show the author's views at least on one point we may refer to his comparison of the Old Testament miracles with those of the New Test- ament. He observes: "In the New Testament the contemporary evidence for the miracles, taken as a whole, is as strong as for the more ordinary events. It is impossible to separate the miraculous from the narrative without destroying it. The argument is overwhelming. But it must be admitted that the evidence for many of the stories of the Old Testament is insufficient to counterbalance the inherent improbability of the events" (p. 49). However, is it not obvious even to a casual reader that almost all the miracles of the New Testament are merely a repetition of those ascribed to Elijah and Elisha in an exaggerated form? Shall we assume that Old Testament fiction was realised in the New Testament? Is this conception also a part of "modern scholarship?" The book consists of seven chapters and concludes with an epilogue expressing the author's sentiments and appreciation of the Old Testament from a Christian point of view. Its style is clear, concise and attractive. Its main purpose is to make biblical criticism acceptable to the orthodox Christian believer. It contains also two appendices, the first on the Book of Jonah, and the second on the study of the Old Testament. 13 Under this heading may also be discussed Robinson's work The Decline and Fall of the Hebrew Kingdom (Israel in the Eighth and Seventh Centuries B. C.). Though the book bears an historic title, the title does I3 Old Testament Vol. III. The Decline and Fall of the Hebrew King- dom. Israel in the Eighth and Seventh Centuries, B. c. By T. H.

This book presents the third volume of the Old Testament Series of the Clarendon Bible. Its aim is set forth by the General Editors: "The problem of the teaching of Holy Scripture at the present time presents many difficulties. There is a large and growing class of persons who feel bound to recognize that the progress of archaeological and critical studies has made it impossible for them to read, and still more to teach it, precisely in the old way. However strongly they may believe in inspiration, they cannot any longer set before their pupils, or take as the basis of their interpretation, the doctrine of verbal inspiration of Holy Scripture. It is with the object of meeting the requirements not only of the elder pupils in public schools, their teachers, students in training colleges, and otliers engaged in educa- tion, but also of the clergy and the growing class of the general public, which we believe takes an interest in biblical studies, that the present series is projected." They further declare, that it is not the writer's intention to set out the latest notions of radical scholars-English or foreign-or even to describe the exact position at which the discussion of the various problems has arrived. The aim of the series is rather to put forward a constructive view of the Books and their teaching, taking into consideration and welcoming results as to which there is a large measure of agreement among scholars. However, they have completely overlooked the fact that there is a large measure of agreement on radical views among modern scholars, and the book would be bound to be repre- sentative of radical criticism. The author's position on fundamental points is indeed in conformity with that of tHe advanced critics, though on minor points his position is somewhat more moderate, as seen from his book Prophecy and the Prophets, reviewed in this Quarterly (XVII pp. 100-104), and the same point of view is found also in his present work. If one cannot take the doctrine of verbal inspiration as the basis of biblical interpretation-a doctrine which is absolutely against reason and ought never to have come into existence-, is there any need for going to the other extreme in accepting as its basis radical criticism? Considering that the very aim of the author is to make the Bible student and the general reader acquainted with the views generally held by modern critics, no originality is expected, and it is unnecessary to enter into a discussion of the book's contents. It is exceedingly well written and the presentation of the various subjects is profusely illus-</page><page sequence="21">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 341 trated with scenes, mostly ancient, but also modern, besides maps and plans. The main part of the work deals with the Book of Kings and the writings of the pre-exilic prophets, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, Zepha- niah, Nahum, Habakuk, and Jeremiah, besides the Book of Deut- eronomy which is identified with the Book of the Law discovered under the reign of Josiah. Each of these Books is treated in the form of an introduction and notes on selected passages. The reason for placing Micah before Isaiah, which is done also in the Chronological Table, arranged by Evelyn W. Hippisley, is not apparent. The work is supplemented by additional notes which discuss the text of the Old Testament, the chronology of the period, the prophets, the prophetic books, Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomists, and eschatology. The whole is preceded by an introduction which contains a brief outline of the historical back- ground of the Near East during this period, and then proceeds to describe the political history of Israel and Judah, their social, economic conditions, and their religious conceptions. The arrangement of the materials is on the whole excellent. 4 Another contribution to biblical criticism, published in Kittel's Beitrdge, and which may lead to important results, is Rost's work Die Uberlieferung von der Thronnachfolge Davids. We have seen that Wiese's investigation Zur Literarkritik des Buches der Richter pursues the aim of demonstrating that the hands of the Jahvist and Elohist are not dis- cernible in the narratives of the Book of the Judges. Our author goes further in proving by a critical analysis that neither are they found in the Books of Samuel. But we have seen that the very existence of these documents in the Hexateuch had become a matter of dispute, and those who deny their existence will not be greatly interested in the author's arguments. As far as the analysis is concerned, a presentation of its account is nigh impossible. We shall limit ourselves to its results. In his analysis of the narrative of the ark, the author comes to the conclu- sion that, though separated in various parts of the two Books of Samuel, it originally formed a unity. In the narrative of Nathan's prophecy, he finds three strata dating from various periods, and objects to the various views which assign it to a late period. In the record of the war against the Ammonites, he sees an independent source. He finally dwells on the narratives of David's succession and shows, first of all, contradic- '4 Die Uberlieferung von der Thronnachfolge Davids. Von Lic.

He likewise objects to those that find there a series of independent novels, seeing that linguistically and stylistically there is not the least distinction discernible. On the other hand, he demonstrates by a brief sketch of all these narratives their close and logical connection. With regard to their author, he was certainly a member of the royal court, though there is no reason to accept Klostermann's suggestion ascribing their authorship to Abimaaz or that of Duhm, that Ebjathar was their author. He points out also that in only a few of these narratives God acts directly, and his conclusion is that they constitute a unity. This is a very learned work full of sagacity. But as far as the problem is concerned, this is a family quarrel among the critics; let them fight it out among themselves. I5 Chronology is the backbone of history, and if it is exact on all points, the conclusions based upon it may be accepted as almost certain, and thus it differs from all other solutions of historical problems which are more or less of a relative value. This is the contention of Thilo in his Die Chronologie des Danielbuches, which investigates the chronological data of the Book of Daniel. The investigation presupposes that the author of this biblical book lived in the second century at the period of Antiochus Epiphanes, a view now almost generally held both by modern and conservative scholars. The starting point is the problem of the chronological notice of Daniel 1, 1, which dates Nebuchadnezzar's inva- sion of Judah in the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim. This cannot be reconciled with the date of Jeremiah 46, 2 which places this event in the fourth year of this king's reign. The second and main problem is the date given chapter 9, 26 which reads: "And after 62 weeks shall an annointed one be cut off." It is commonly held that this anointed one was the high priest Onias III who was deposed by Antiochus Epiph- anes. The weeks in this date are taken as cycles of seven years, and the 62 weeks are reckoned from 605 to 171 more or less. But more difficult are the dates of seventy weeks and seven weeks found 9, 24. The explana- tions and the discussions of the various views are highly complicated and students interested will have to read them for themselves. It is the author's opinion that these numbers were already an apocalyptic tradi- tion at the time of the composition of the Book of Daniel. He also credits the author of Daniel with an exact knowledge of Babylonian and Persian history and on this point takes issue with other scholars who deny this fact, but his arguments are scarcely convincing. However, 15 Die Chronologie des Danietbuches. Von Lic. Dr. MARTIN THILO. Bonn: VERLAG VON ALEXANDER SCHMIDT, 1926. Pp. 43.</page><page sequence="23">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 343 while there may be a few points which will not find assent, the work as a whole is of an original and ingenious character and will no doubt be favorably accepted by biblical scholars. 16 The Old Testament has been shot full of holes by modern biblical science, so that "from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it, but wounds, and bruises, and festering sores." Some of the missiles of the sharpshooters are aimed at the fountain head of Israel's religion, the Decalogue, holding that it is neither Mosaic nor pre-exilic but a post-exilic invention. Israel's Lawgiver himself has been reduced to a shadowy personality whose existence is more or less doubt- ful, arid it became questionable whether any of the biblical laws may be traced to his authorship. Others directed their attacks at the Patri- archs putting them out of existence as individuals. The biblical narra- tives concerning their lives are declared as being partly legendary and partly pure inventions of Israelitish writers. The actions ascribed to them are branded as being immoral and offensive to a pure, religious feeling. There is a concentrated assault against the stronghold of Israel, participated in even by conservative scholars; its religious conception is condemned as being of a low character. Offence is taken at the claim that Jahveh is designated the God of Israel and of no other nation.- That it was Israel alone that recognised His existence, so that it means, that the Godhead worshipped by Israel, and that even Deutero-Isaiah whose monotheistic and universalistic conceptions cannot be doubted, used the same designations, is not taken into consideration.-Deep indignation is further expressed at the claim that Israel's wars are pre- sented as the wars of Jahveh.-Yet for more than one millennium and a half to the World War, nations confessing the same religious belief, were slaughtering one another, scarcely with any intermission, praying to the same God and using the same prayer formulae for the destruction of their enemies, and during all these periods, the spiritual leaders of each warring people proclaimed the sacred character of its cause and the Divine approval of its battles. Why then be so squeamish, if the ancient Israelites claimed to fight the battles of Jahveh against their heathen enemies? Christians ought to be the last to raise such an accusation and to deny the claim that they were actually the battles of Jahveh, as with- out them Israel's religion would not have survived and the Christian creed would never have come into existence. Some are horrified at the 16 What Remains of the Old Testament and Other Essays. By HERMANN GUNKEL. Translated by the Rev. A. K. DALLAS, M. A. New York- THE MACMILLAN CO., 1928. Pp. 187.</page><page sequence="24">344 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW fact that the pious Hebrew hurls fearful curses against the enemy of his nation, without any feeling of the injustice and wrong involved in such expressions. They forgot that if the pious Hebrews could have avenged their terrible fate and indescribable wrongs inflicted upon them by the hands of these enemies, they would have hurled fearful weapons against them and not fearful curses. With regard to the prophets, their claim to have been divinely inspired is by the overwhelming majority of the modern scholars not even taken into consideration, and it is held that they claimed it for the purpose of lending divine authority to their utterances. Thus this claim was nothing but a pious fraud and the prophets were nothing short of deceivers. Yet they were the founders of Ethical Monotheism, which is claimed to be the basis and the essence of the Christian creed. As to the prophetic writings, only an insignificant part of them is admitted to be of their authorship. Predictions found in them that were actually fulfilled are taken as interpolations post eventum, inserted by the editors of their writings. This is certainly noth- ing short of forgery. Late writers are further accused of having falsified Israel's history in presenting early events in the light of later religious conceptions. The Christian reader who studies the Bible in the light of modern criticism cannot but come to the conclusion that the Old Testament on the whole consists of a collection of forgeries largely of a low religious conception. If so, is he not fully justified in raising the question: What Remains of the Old Testament? This is the title of Gunkel's book, which consists of a collection of essays of this great Bible scholar and critic, published in various German periodicals between the years 1914-24, and recently translated into English by A. K. Dallas. Modern biblical science has inflicted such deadly wounds on the Old Testament, that among the teachers in the German elementary schools the cry is raised to bury this offensive corpse; in removing it from the schoolroom, it is natural that Old Testament scholars should feel depressed at having created a Frankenstein that is going to eject from school and Church the subject to the study of which they have devoted their whole life and render it obsolete as no longer of any value. The famous author who, on some points is more moderate than other critics, rises valiantly to the defence of the Old Testament. His starting point is, that to Old Testament science the Bible in the first instance is a book produced by human means in human ways. Science has brought it down from heaven and set it up in the midst of earth. It treats the Old Testament and the people of Israel with the same methods as would be applied to any other book and any other people. By doing</page><page sequence="25">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 345 so, Old Testament science justly claims to be a fully qualified member of the circle of historical sciences. But admitting the author's claim, this would not justify Old Testament science for intruding itself into the Theological Colleges as a Theological discipline and certainly not into the elementary schools, and far less into the Church, as it would then stand on the same level as Sanskrit and other Asiatic literatures. However, this is merely a preamble, and the author goes much further proving that its value is incomparably more than other historical sci- ences. "Just because we have dealt with the Old Testament in this manner, we have rediscovered its true significance for the history of the world; and to the question: What do we have in the Old Testament? we reply soberly and definitely: We have a great treasure, a very great treasure in the Old Testament" (p. 19). It seems that modern criticism has rediscovered a fact that was always obvious to those not blinded by its theories. In the first place, the author dwells on the almost illimitable wealth of artistic stimulation found in the Old Testament, referring to the poetical narratives in Genesis and Ruth, and quoting numerous pas- sages from the prophets, many of whom were also poets of the first rank, using a language full of power and energy and majestic elevation, who were trumpets of God, uttering notes of such strength that our ears can hardly bear them, filled with overwhelming anger and overflowing with rapture, or at other times melting into pity, torn by grief and sorrow, and withal rising to defiant faith. He further cites examples from the Old Testament lyric poetry and observes: "Taken as a whole, all the poetry of the ancient East is much inferior to that of the Hebrews, and the highest praise that can be given to a Babylonian or Egyptian song is that it is not altogether unworthy of being compared with the poems of the Bible" (p. 27). He points out, that generally speaking, the Hebrew mind has not the type of genius required for lengthy productions, and so the shorter the pieces the more beautiful they are, and yet it succeeded in producing one great poem of length, the Book of Job, in which the author is bold enough to impugn or even to attack the strongest base of the whole Hebrew religion, the doctrine of divine retribution. How- ever, it is an error on the part of the author to maintain that the ortho- doxy of past centuries revealed no understanding of this pearl of the Old Testament poetry (p. 30). We would recommend him to read the commentary on Job by Gersonides (13th century c. E.), which is regret- ably quite unknown among Christian scholars, and he would change his mind on this point.</page><page sequence="26">346 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The author further declares that all the things mentioned are but trifles when compared with the greatest treasure of the Old Testament, its religious value, though averring that in numerous details and in its profoundest thoughts it is much inferior to the Christian religion. He asserts that in reality there is a close connection between the two Testa- ments, and that the religion of the New Testament arose on the founda- tion of the Old Testament Jewish religion, and thus the former is historically inconceivable without this basis. Jesus was born and edu- cated as a Jew, nourishing his spirit on the Old Testament, and no trace of Hellenistic influence can be found in him, and although such influence was undoubtedly present in Paul and John, they too remained Jews in all essential elements. It was within the walls of the synagogue that Christianity spent its early days; it only left it when it was forcibly expelled, but to the inheritance which it brought from its ancestral home it has clung down through the centuries. These are of course truisms, and it is characteristic of our age that there is a need for point- ing them out. The author concludes this argument with the words that the interpretation of the Old Testament may change, but the right of the Old Testament to its place in the Church is indisputable, and it will be read as Holy Scriptures as long as the Church endures. The author proceeds to call attention to the fact that the Old Testa- ment possesses many features that give it an outstanding religious value for the present day altogether apart from its connection with the Church. It has a wealth of thoughts and conceptions which form the imperishable achievements of the Hebrew spirit, and they can never become obsolete, for they lie at the root of all modern thinking whatever attitude man may take toward Church and religion. It contains also conceptions, which although they may have now been outgrown in the history of thought, can never be forgotten, because they were necessary stages in the path of evolution. It has among its peculiar thoughts some which form a valuable counterpoise to certain injurious tendencies of our time. Simplicity is a fundamental feature of the Hebrew religion, as for instance, the principles of morality as expressed in the Ten Commandments: "Words like these, with the breath of the primeval world upon them, tower up like giant mountain peaks. Empires disappear; nations pass away; even modern nations and States have no promise of permanence; all external civilization is in constant movement, but foundations like these moral principles abide',' (p. 37). Another instance for simplicity is the great Tenet of Monotheism, which is so simple that a child should be able to understand it, and is the root of all higher moral and spiritual religion.</page><page sequence="27">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 347 Another tenet equally simple is Divine retribution of good and evil. There is further the controversy which the prophets carried on with the people of their time with regard to the question: Wherein consists true service of God? In the prophetic words: "I desire mercyand not sacrifices," religion and morality have formed an alliance that can never be dis- solved. To-day all views of the world lead up to morality, even those in which it is not easy to see any relation to morality at all. In this inward necessity to which even the modern spirit pays homage, we have an achievement of the Hebrew prophets. All modern social legislation is an outcome of these Hebrew teachers, who hammered into the hearts of their people, and through their writings into the heart of all mankind, the truth that the essence of sin among men is oppression of the lowly, and righteousness consists in the worthy treatment of the poor and oppressed. The spirit of these Hebrew teachers will continue to urge the nations to ever fresh efforts. There are not many scholars who would have had the courage to express frankly such an opinion, crediting the Hebrew prophets with modern social legislation, though it is the plain truth. The second essay is entitled Fundamental Problems of Hebrew Literary History. Its aim is to give a brief account of the principles underlying a History of the Hebrew Literature. But this investigation is too com- plicated and not of much interest for the general reader and Bible student. Of far more importance is the third Essay The Religion of the Psalms. The starting point of the author is here also, as in the first essay, the discussion about the value of the Old Testament for the Protestant Church. The Psalms are classified according to their types, in order to have a clear view of the aspects presented by the religious life of Israel. Of an highly exegetical value is the fourth essay The Close of Micah: A Prophetical Liturgy, which is presented as A Study in Literary History. Any Bible student is well aware of the difficulties involved in the inter- pretation of Micah VII, 7-20, which are almost unsurmountable. The fifth essay is Jacob, in which the main argument is that figures like that of Jacob are neither historical figures, nor gods of former days, nor pre- historic tribes but heroes of primitive narratives. The same view is expressed about Reuben, Judah, Dinah, and Joseph. JACOB HOSCHANDER Jewish Theological Seminary of America</page></plain_text>
