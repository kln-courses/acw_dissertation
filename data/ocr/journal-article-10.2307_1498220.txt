<plain_text><page sequence="1">Belsnickling in a Nova Scotia Island Community RICHARD BAUMAN Christmas mumming is one of those customs which was all but made to order for the antiquarians and survivalists of the nine- teenth century and their ritualist epigones of the twentieth; the antiquity of the institution was well documented, its seasonal sig- nificance was unquestionable, and its ritual nature apparently ob- vious (V72). Accordingly, the literature on mumming abounds with references to fertility gods, saturnalia, and death and resur- rection, all focused backward on the roots of the custom in dim antiquity. Recently, however, there have been signs of an emerg- ing reorientation in the study of mumming, away from the sur- vivalist perspective and toward a concern with the social and sym- bolic significance of the institution where it may still be studied as a living tradition. Halpert and Story and their collaborators have provided a pioneering series of ethnographic analyses of Christmas mumming in Newfoundland; Turner, Norbeck, and others have pointed the way toward structuralist analyses of festivals of this kind.1 The present paper has taken its lead from these recent works in the study of belsnickles in the La Have Islands, Nova Scotia. Belsnickles is a term applied to a series of related forms of Christ- mas mumming found in areas of German settlement in North America. The common term derives from the German Peltznickel, though the forms it designates are often syncretic adaptations, com- bining German features with aspects of the English mumming tradition borrowed from neighbors of English stock. Belsnickling has been described for Nova Scotia by Creighton, Pennsylvania by 1. Herbert Halpert and G. M. Story, Christmas Mumming in Newfoundland (Toron- to, 1969); Victor Turner, The Ritual Process (Chicago, 1969); Edward Norbeck, "Rites of Reversal," a paper delivered at the annual meeting of the American An- thropological Association, San Diego, California, 19 November 1970.

It is the purpose of this paper to provide such a description as well as an analysis of the complex structural and symbolic significance of this form of mum- ming within the community. Our study of belsnickles was carried out in the La Have Islands, which lie off the shore of Lunenburg County at the mouth of the La Have River, on the southwest coast of Nova Scotia. The back- ground of the Island population is difficult to establish with any certainty. Folk history holds that some of the earliest settlers were deserters from British ships in Halifax, for whom the remote Is- lands were a haven from the law. German surnames are not un- common among the residents, reflecting the German background of much of the population of Lunenburg County. Other settlers appear to have come to the Islands from the Anglo-Irish settlement at nearby West Dublin, and still others were probably of Yankee stock, via the western part of the County.3 The Islanders them- selves do not make anything of whatever German connections they may have had, and German was never current on the Islands. Concerning Christmas mumming, or belsnickling, on the Is- lands, it seems to be of mixed German and English derivation. The term belsnickle, as noted, is derived from the German Peltznickel, used in the Palatinate for a figure associated both with Saint Nich- olas' Day and Christmas.4 Many of the German settlers in Lunen- burg County came from this area of Germany and it is possible that they brought the term and the institution with them. On the other hand, the same term is used for Christmas mummers by the Penn- 2.

Perhaps the common ties with the Rhine- land underlie the terminological similarity. The attribution of mixed German-English ancestry to belsnick- ling is made chiefly on morphological grounds, consistent with the mixed roots of the Lunenburg County population. The German Peltznickels and related figures made their rounds as individuals and were chiefly inquisitors, dealing out both punishment and treats to children. Belsnickling in the La Have Islands carries the German name and inquisitor element in combination with an in- formal house visit and performance by a group of collectors which are more characteristically English.6 Shoemaker has described sim- ilar syncretisms in Pennsylvania.7 In recent years, belsnickling has died out on the Islands, though the Islanders see an echo of it in Halloween trick-or-treating, which has made its way into their culture via the mass media. My in- formants ranged from approximately fifty to almost ninety years of age, and the description of belsnickles which follows pertains to the period between about 1900 and the beginning of the second World War. Belsnickling in the La Have Islands falls within Halpert's In- formal Visit type of mumming, involving a house-visit, a visitation by inquisitors, and a collectors' performance.8 While belsnickling proper took place on Christmas Eve-from just after dark to after midnight-the institution pertains to the entire Christmas season. The horns and bells associated with belsnickles were sounded as much as a fortnight before Christmas and especially on the night before Christmas Eve "to show the belsnickles was around," and a small number of those who went belsnickling on Christmas Eve also wore their costumes on New Year's Eve when they joined their cohorts in firing in the New Year. These were designated New Year's Bucks.9 5. Shoemaker, 73. 6. Halpert and Story, 37-39; Shoemaker, 21-23. 7. Shoemaker, 21, 73-85. 8. Halpert and Story, 36-44. 9. Cf.

This is not to say that it was con- fined solely to these groups, for a few of the younger married men went belsnickling as well. Nevertheless, the activity was associated with the older boys and unmarried men and considered most ap- propriate for people of that age. The youngest belsnickles were fifteen or sixteen years old, with the majority around eighteen to twenty-one and the oldest between twenty-five and thirty. In terms of Island society, the age of belsnickling was a socially transitional one, between childhood and full adulthood; boys began working for a living around sixteen, but did not conventionally marry or leave their parents' households till their early twenties (A1530). Toward the very end of the heyday of belsnickling, in the years just preceding the second World War, a few of the bolder girls on the island began to join the groups of belsnickles, but generally speaking belsnickling was considered too wild and licentious an activity for women. Certainly married women never went belsnick- ling, and some of the girls who dressed up for belsnickling were too timid to go into houses and would run away when approached. Even some of the more bashful males in the community declined to go belsnickling or backed out at the last minute. Belsnickling groups ranged in size from approximately eight to fifteen members, with twelve a more or less average figure. The costumed belsnickles were characteristically accompanied by one or two of their fellows who did not dress up, but served as "guides" for the belsnickles, who were supposed to be strangers to the island. These guides, who stayed outside when the belsnickles entered the houses on their route, carried lanterns "to pilot them around" and did the rowing when the belsnickles visited neighboring islands within their mumming territory. When it came to dividing the evening's treats, however, they received an equal share. The groups were very distinctly local in composition, consisting of one's own friends "that lived handy 'round home," that is, on one's own island and the other islands which were linked with it by local community ties. The visiting territory too was local; with comparatively rare exceptions belsnickles visited only within their own home community. The community on which I concentrated</page><page sequence="5">BELSNICKLING 233 my attention, for instance, consisted of the lower end of Bush Island (approximately twenty-five households), Covey's Island (two households), and Hirtle's Island (three households). The upper end of Bush Island, George's Island, and Tumblin's Island con- stituted another community ("They never mixed with us up there"), as did Bell's and Wolf's Islands, and so on. For the belsnickles, much of the enjoyment of mumming was connected with the making and wearing of their disguises. People worked for days, even a whole fortnight, on their costumes as Christmas Eve approached. Most of the preparation took place at home, but there were times as well when a number of young peo- ple gathered in an old house or barn and had a party "gettin' to- gether tryin' to make a rig." The goal of the belsnickles was to make the costumes as grotesque as possible. Comments like "some of 'em was hard lookin'," or "we had some awful lookin' rigs," in- dicated enthusiastic approval when applied to the belsnickles. Belsnickle disguises in the La Have Islands were of three major types, with wide variation within each type. The first, and prob- ably the most common type was a wild, disheveled, grotesque, but essentially anthropomorphic figure. This disguise was effected by dressing in torn, tattered clothes hanging in shreds and turned in- side out to hinder recognition still further. Occasionally the tat- tered effect was enhanced by hanging strips of paper to the shred- ded cloth, and a pillow was stuffed in front of the costume to "make 'em puff out." The masks, which were perhaps the most important component of the disguises, were made of painted canvas for the most part, al- though old stockings and other kinds of cloth were also used. Holes for the eyes and mouth were cut out and trimmed around with yarn. To the mask were added a long nose made of canvas, and hair and whiskers of raveled rope or sheep's wool. The costume was characteristically topped off with a tall, pointy hat-so high it could not get through the doorway-again made of canvas or a stocking cap stuffed tightly with rags to make it stand up. To com- plete the disguise cloth horns were attached to the hat, or rags hung from its tip. The second type of disguise was in most ways similar to the first, except that it was meant to make the wearer look still less human and more animal-like. Differences centered mostly on the mask,</page><page sequence="6">234 WESTERN FOLKLORE which was painted with an animal's face and crowned with horns. In a few cases, the mask itself was made of sheepskin or rabbit skin. Belsnickles who wore this type of disguise hung cowbells around their necks, or, for those who did not have a cowbell, tin cans filled with pebbles sufficed. Disguises of the third type were quite different from the other two, involving a kind of rough transvestitism, or sex reversal. The belsnickles who dressed as women used meal bags made of hemp for skirts, with the mouth of the bag at the waist, fitted with a draw- string, and with the wide part at the bottom. The costume was stuffed out with lots of padding, and women's features painted on the masks. In a few cases, a disguise was worn which did not fit any of these types, but these were almost always the result of a last-minute de- cision to join the group of belsnickles. One man wore his long underwear over his clothes, others simply wore a stocking over their faces, or darkened their faces with stove-blacking. When there was time for preparation, however, one of the three main types almost always resulted. Whatever the nature of the disguise, it was supplemented by a pair of old boots-if possible, not one's own-and most important, a pair of gloves or mittens for the hands: "everybody was used to you-they could tell you right quick by your hands." Finally, to round out their costumes, many of the belsnickles carried horns to blow or bells to ring as they made their rounds. It was not, of course, sufficient to disguise one's person alone to avoid recognition in a community as closely knit as those on the La Have Islands. Besides their costumes, the belsnickles concealed their identity still further by altering their voices and movements. Belsnickles dressed as women made their voices "squealy," and caricatured feminine movements, while those who wore costumes of the other types affected "coarse" or "rough" voices and walked hunched over, with a rolling gait. Those who felt they could not disguise their voices effectively simply refrained from talking at all. The belsnickles began their visiting rounds shortly after dark on Christmas Eve. "The very minute the sun went down, we'd go in a barn or someplace and start to rig up." Once dressed, the bel- snickles began their rounds, ringing their bells, blowing their</page><page sequence="7">BELSNICKLING 235 horns, singing, occasionally shooting off firecrackers, and generally making their presence known. When they reached a house, the belsnickles' chief method for requesting admission was to knock on the door, or more often a window, and call out "belsnickles allowed in?" Most people, ap- parently "was glad to have 'em come" and "let 'em right in," put- ting aside the nets they were knitting for the fifteen or twenty minutes that the belsnickles would stay. Very few families refused the mummers admittance-perhaps two or three at most-al- though every house in the community was visited. Those who re- fused were either very old people, finicky housekeepers who did not want their floors dirtied by the belsnickles' muddy boots, or families whose small children were so frightened by the belsnickles that their parents feared they "would get the fits." Once inside the house, and with the encouragement of their hosts, the belsnickles launched into their special performance be- havior, characteristically indecorous and licentious. This behavior was summed up by my informants with such phrases as, "you'd put on a little act," "just act the jackass," "carry on a little bit," or "act the fool." The performances usually involved grotesque singing and almost always clumsy, exaggerated step dancing, and were re- quested by the householders if not soon forthcoming. The dancing was done to the accompaniment of a mouth organ and occasionally a drum, with one member of the group stretching back the mouth of his mask to play while the others danced around the room: "they'd dance or make believe they was dancin'-jump around a little bit." Informants emphasized that it was not only the good dancers who danced, but everyone. One said, "they would just go through the performance-why they couldn't step dance." An- other made the revealing comment that "any of us fellers that didn't dance, well, we danced just the same. We wouldn't dance at all if we wasn't dressed." In effect, then, belsnickling represented a performance occasion for those who were not usually performers: the one event of the year in which those who ordinarily did not feel they had the talent or were otherwise too self-conscious to perform had an opportunity to do so, protected by the anonymity of their disguises. There was no other occasion on which one could act the fool except belsnick-</page><page sequence="8">236 WESTERN FOLKLORE ling on Christmas Eve, and from the testimony of the former bel- snickles themselves this was one of the most salient features of belsnickling and one which gave belsnickling much of its attrac- tion. Besides the singing and dancing, the belsnickles engaged in other "foolish" antics. Some might pretend to be drunk and stagger around the room, while others simply jumped around wildly. Those dressed as women engaged in an exaggerated caricature of feminine behavior-"they was waltzin' around just like women." A degree of sexual license also characterized the behavior of some of the bolder belsnickles, who would do such otherwise for- bidden and daring things as sitting on a woman's knee and hugging her, "just to torment her," or making "as if they was going to kiss the girls." It is clear from all accounts that the householders enjoyed the belsnickles' antics as much as the belsnickles themselves. While such behavior would have been severely censured at any other time, on Christmas Eve, people "just lay back and laughed at you," "people was glad to have 'em come." The licentious performance behavior of the belsnickles was but one major feature of their belsnickling role, and was in fundament- al contrast with a second activity they carried out during their visits, namely, acting as inquisitors. The licentiousness was di- rected at the adults; the focus of the inquisitors was upon the chil- dren of the household, to whom the belsnickles presented a very different face. In the years when belsnickling was in its heyday, La Have Island society was one in which ghosts, spectral apparitions, revenants, and other supernatural beings and forces figured very prominently in the people's consciousness. "Every yard of road had its ghost in them days," and stories about encounters with the supernatural were the most common kinds of narratives in the Islanders' reper- toire. "Ghost stories" were told by both sexes and by children and adults alike.1' In addition, owing to the isolation of the Islands, this was a society in which strangers were most uncommon and seldom seen. Consequently, the children of the Islands had an in- tense fear of the unknown, fostered by an extensive body of beliefs 10. See Creighton, 30-45.</page><page sequence="9">BELSNICKLING 237 and fears of the supernatural and the extranatural, and all these fears were evoked by the grotesque and wild belsnickles. The children's fears of the belsnickles were not assuaged by their parents, but reinforced still further by the use of the belsnickles as bogeymen during the rest of the year. Many of my informants re- called the threat, "the belsnickles will get you" to curtail their mis- behavior as children. Two men in the community are remembered for teasing children by dressing up in long black oilskin coats and belsnickle masks when they saw them coming and scaring the wits out of them. The belsnickles themselves played upon the fears of the children as well as the anticipations of the adults by blowing their horns for several nights before Christmas Eve, "to show the bel- snickles was around" and frighten the children. It required special boldness for a child to venture out of the house after dark around Christmas. Almost all my informants were teenagers themselves be- fore they found out that the belsnickles were local people dressed up in costumes. The net effect of all this was that when the belsnickles entered the house on Christmas Eve, the children were petrified. They took refuge under a table or in a cupboard, or hung onto their parents so "you couldn't tear 'em away." This, then, is the frame of mind in which they faced the belsnickles in their role as inquisitors. Any of the belsnickles could act as inquisitors, and all those who were willing to use their voices did so in one or another of the houses they visited. The inquisitors would call the children of the house forward and ask if they had been good during the past year. Naturally, the children always replied in the affirmative-"we're good, we're good"-whereupon the inquisitors made them promise that they would be good during the coming year as well, and re- warded them with candy which was carried on their belsnicking rounds for this purpose. As is clear from the statements of informants themselves, the belsnickles' indulgence in indecorous and licentious behavior was closely tied to the concealment of their identity: "We wouldn't dance at all if we wasn't dressed." Some informants viewed the fun of hiding their identity as the most enjoyable aspect of belsnickling. The adult householders, of course, knew that the belsnickles were local people, almost as familiar to them as the members of their own households. It was therefore as intriguing a game for</page><page sequence="10">238 WESTERN FOLKLORE them to try to guess the identity of the individual belsnickles as it was for the belsnickles to remain concealed: "we used to have good fun doin' that-tryin' to guess who they was." The householders used various means to uncover the identity of their disguised visitors. Questions such as, "which way did you come?" or "did you have a long walk?" were addressed to the mask- ers, less in the hope of gaining accurate information than of getting the belsnickles to talk in order to hear their voices. The belsnickles never gave straight answers; typical replies to the question "where have you come from?" were "Came from way out in the West In- dies, just got on here," or "Came down on a freighter from Hal- ifax." The guessers looked for other clues to the maskers' identities in their costumes, attempting to find recognizable items among the tattered and patched and borrowed garments from which the bel- snickles fashioned their disguises. They also examined the mum- mers' hands and feet (though these were almost always covered), and tried to peek in around the eye- or mouth-holes or under the masks. Not infrequently, the process of trying to guess the identity of the belsnickles was accompanied by roughhousing as the guessers tried to pull up the belsnickles' masks to get a glimpse of the faces beneath, or tickled them to make them talk. The belsnickles, though, were alert for these attacks, and "they wouldn't allow you to get too handy to 'em." Occasionally, though apparently not often, someone would be identified correctly. Interestingly, however, the guessers never en- joyed the full satisfaction of guessing correctly, because the bel- snickles never unmasked or acknowledged a correct guess, but re- mained concealed throughout the visit. This seems to have been a source of some frustration to the householders, for several inform- ants recall being confronted after Christmas by people who had guessed their identity and were pressing for acknowledgement. This, of course, was a special satisfaction to the belsnickles and all reported with relish how they refused to acknowledge correct guesses to the very end. There remains one final major aspect of belsnickling to be de- scribed, namely, the treats which the householders bestowed on the belsnickles. Before they left each house, the belsnickles would ask the woman of the house for "a bit of brouse"-a term used only in</page><page sequence="11">BELSNICKLING 239 this context-and they were never refused, for those families that were willing to let them in were always prepared in advance with something for the maskers. The most common and welcome treat was cake. Christmas cakes in the La Have Islands were special in being made with sugar instead of the molasses used during the rest of the year. Belsnickles received cake of all kinds, as well as cookies, apples, and, in later years when they were no longer so expensive, oranges. A special feature of the giving of treats to the belsnickles was that they were never consumed in the house but carried away and eaten later. This may have had something to do with the difficulty of eating without moving one's mask and revealing one's identity. One member of the group carried a basket, sack, or bucket in which the food was collected, and at the end of their rounds the belsnickles retired to a house or "store" to have a party with what had been collected. What could not be finished at one setting was divided up among the group and taken home. For descriptive convenience, it has been useful to break bel- snickling down into a number of component elements, each recog- nized as significant by the participants. We have reviewed who the belsnickles were, where and when they acted as belsnickles, their disguises, performances, licentious behavior, and behavior as in- quisitors, the attempts made at guessing their identity, the treats they received from their hosts, and some of the beliefs and re- sponses of the various participants in the belsnickling interaction. Taken together, these elements make up the complex whole of belsnickling as behavior and event, the materials of the festival scenario. It remains, however, to ask how the festival fit together on a more fundamental level-what can we say of the symbolic struc- ture of belsnickling, its meaning as a ritual of social relations with- in the La Have Island community? The belsnickles, as we have pointed out, were the young un- married men of the community, mostly in their teens or early twenties. In terms of Island society, they occupied a distinctly tran- sitional position, being no longer children, but just on the verge of assuming their full roles and responsibilities; the early to middle twenties were the years in which the young men of the community characteristically married and separated from their parents' house- holds to establish households of their own. They were, then, at a</page><page sequence="12">240 WESTERN FOLKLORE stage in life where they were having to give up the carelessness of boyhood and the peer group and face up to the stronger social de- mands and constraints of adulthood. Belsnickling, I believe, is most fruitfully examined as a symbolic and ritual manipulation of the transitional position of the belsnicklers, playing upon the ambigui- ty of their liminality, to borrow Victor Turner's term for transi- tional qualities "betwixt and between" fixed points or statuses in the social structure."1 By assuming their mumming disguises, the belsnickles were able to put off all semblance of social identity to the fullest possible ex- tent. In fact, they went beyond mere anonymity to complete re- versal of their social and human status, becoming variously an- imals, women, or lumpish and infrahuman creatures, removing themselves as far as possible from the social order and reveling in their own communitas, to borrow again from Turner, their own undifferentiated fellowship, set apart from the social order.2 Their evening of communitas culminated in the communal feast at the end of the evening. The behavior of the belsnickles was part of a complex ritual structure that revolved around their liminality and fully exploited the ambiguity of that condition. In considering their behavior as inquisitors, vis-a-vis the children, for instance, it is evident that in frightening and intimidating the youngsters of the household, the belsnickles were gaining release from the time, just recently left behind, when they themselves were fearful children, terrified of the strange and the supernatural and subject to external mechan- isms of moral control. On the other hand, it must be recognized that at the very same time the belsnickles were rejecting their for- mer status as children from their position outside the social order, they were also acting as agents of the social order by participating in the socialization of the children. By calling the children to ac- count for their behavior during the past year and extracting prom- ises of good behavior for the year to come, as well as by serving as bogeymen for bad behavior throughout the year, the belsnickles served as an agency of moral order. We may discern, then, a basic opposition in the place and behavior of the belsnickles: they were 11. Turner, ch. 3 and pass. 12. Ibid.</page><page sequence="13">BELSNICKLING 241 outside the social order and behaved in an unsocialized and licen- tious manner, yet they served as a powerful agency for the socializa- tion of children.13 This, however, is only half the picture, for during the course of their visits the belsnickles interacted not only with the children but with the adults of the household as well. Significantly, however, the ambiguity which surrounded their liminal nature allowed them to turn a different face to the adults, one which contrasted structurally with their position in their relationship with the chil- dren. We have noted that belsnickling provided a means by which the young men could disassociate themselves from their own child- hood by frightening the children as they were frightened them- selves not long before. By the same token, it allowed them symbol- ically to reject the status of adult as well by allowing them to violate the everyday rules of adult decorum by carousing about the house, indulging in sexual license, and resisting adult attempts to pin them down in their true social identities. However, whereas the role of inquisitor placed the belsnickles in a superordinate role vis-a-vis the children, and made them the agents of the moral and social order in that relationship, their position was entirely re- versed in their moral relationship with the adults. Here, I would argue, the adults were the representatives of the moral order and ultimately emerged as the dominant parties in the relationship; though the outcome once again served to reinforce the moral order, the belsnickles played a structurally different symbolic role in the transaction. This interpretation is based upon the basic association in the minds of the Islanders between the belsnickles and the supernatur- al forces and beings which were the ubiquitous feature of the night- time world on the Islands. Although this association took its purest form in the minds of the children, for whom the belsnickles were unquestionably emissaries from another realm, the adults too made this connection while knowing at the same time that the mummers were members of their own community in disguise. Normally, the domain of these supernatural beings was outside the house; the 13. William Willeford has noted "the tendency of fools to serve the principle of wholeness by bringing together extremes and even opposites." See The Fool and His Scepter: A Study in Clowns and Jesters and Their Audience (Evanston, Ill., 1969), 17.</page><page sequence="14">242 WESTERN FOLKLORE household was the realm of order and safety. On Christmas Eve, however, the supernatural and the strange, in the form of the bel- snickles, approached and entered the household itself. In contrast, however, with the malign and threatening figures which peopled the night during the rest of the year, the belsnickles were harmless and amusing. For all their grotesquesness and antisocial behavior, they were, in the end, concerned largely with entertaining the adults of the house. From the very beginning of the encounter, control was in the hands of the adult householders, for the bel- snickles were compelled to ask to be allowed in, thus conceding the primacy of the householders in their own home. Then, although the mummers took certain liberties which transcended the bound- aries of conventional decorum, the final element in the transaction clearly placed the householders in a superordinate position; when the belsnickles asked their hosts for food and their request was granted, the relationship was confirmed as a form of host-guest re- lationship which, on the Islands, placed the host in a superordinate and controlling position. In the view of all the Islanders, bel- snickles and householders alike, the treats were understood to be a favor bestowed by the hosts, with nothing of the sense of an offering or a bribe about them. The belsnickles were guests and acknowl- edged their status as such. By so doing, they afforded the house- holders the opportunity of bringing the forces of disorder under control; they validated and reinforced, through ritual and sym- bolic means, the security of the household and the moral order it represented. In this light, we may speculate that the failure of the belsnickles to unmask may have heightened the effect, for if they had revealed themselves as specific and familiar individuals, the illusion served by their association with the malign supernatural world would have been lessened and the ultimate victory of the social order mitigated. Our analysis may be summarized in diagrammatic form (see fig. 1). The transitional position of the young unmarried men of the community was given symbolic expression in the anti-identity of the belsnickles which they assumed on Christmas Eve. By acting as belsnickles, liminal figures outside the social order, they were able to reject both their former status as children and their pros- pective status as full adult members of the community. At the same time, however, they represented an agency through which the</page><page sequence="15">BELSNICKLING 243 moral order of the community was reinforced by ritual means. On the moral level, the belsnickles assumed an intermediate position in a moral hierarchy which upheld the moral order of the com- munity. They were superordinate agents of socialization and order in their relationship with the less fully socialized children, while remaining subordinate symbols of disorder in relation to the moral integrity of the adult household. It is noteworthy that in both sets of relations, the giving of food (candy to the children, treats to the belsnickles) served as a means of establishing the moral hierarchy which is central to the festival.
