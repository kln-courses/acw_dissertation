<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE REDEEMER OF ISRAEL At the core of OT faith and worship is the conviction that Israel lived in covenant with Yah weh, and by that covenant was transformed into a holy people on pilgrimage toward the fullness of covenant blessings. Every aspect of Israel's life and hope fell within the ambit of that relationship. Similarly, at the core of NT faith and worship is the conviction that Jesus is Lord and Messiah (Acts 2:36), establishing a new covenant and redeeming all men by His death and resurrection. In recent decades much energy has been devoted to the study of these statements from a variety of historical, literary and theological perspectives ; scholars have attempted to probe the unfolding faith-understanding of Israel, both old and new. This study offers a synthesis of significant conclusions documented and widely though not universally accepted, hoping in this fashion to bring some small light to the form and content of Israel's faith and to the NT reality which brought that faith to fulfillment. The Problem of Hittite Treaties If one examines the narrative of the Sinaitic covenant as enshrined in the Tetrateuch (Ex 19-24), it becomes obvious to even the most casual reader that considerable redactional activity has taken place throughout the history of the tradition. Evidence of that process appears on many levels. The sudden mention of Israelite priests for the first time (Ex 19:22,24), and indeed prior to the account of Aaron's consecration (Lv 8), as well as the mention of the shophar in the context of the theophany (Ex 19:16,19), suggest that cultic interests and liturgical usage had a considerable part to play in the final formulation of the text.1 Moreover, the account is filled with logical inconsistencies and stylistic irregularities which contribute to a highly complex narrative: the multiple and humanly exhausting move- ments of Moses up and down the mountain (Ex 19:3,7,8,9,14 etc.) ; the acceptance on the part of the people prior to the actual covenant (Ex 19:8) ; the occasional ambiguous use of pronouns (Ex 19:13b: hēmma) ; the storm theophany interwoven with elements of volcanic origin (Ex 19:16,18) ; the multiplicity of law forms and codes (Ex 20-23) ; the double tradition of covenant making as either a meal on top of the mountain (Ex 24:1-2,9-11) 1 The mention of Nadab and Abihu in the primitive account of the covenant meal (Ex 24:1,9) may well be another example, resulting from the final formulation of the priestly genealogies which recognized the authority of Aaronite priests in Jerusalem. For a contrary opinion, cf. M. Noth, Exodus: A Commentary (tr. J. Bowden; Phila- delphia: Westminster, 1962) 195. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 34 or a sacrifice at the foot of the same (Ex 24:3-8) ; etc. These and countless other inconsistencies have been listed elsewhere ;2 they are recalled by way of introduction to reaffirm the complexity of this narrative's history and significance, as well as the necessity of such analysis for current under- standing of the theology of covenant in Israel. It has been fashionable in recent years to suggest a considerable similarity between the biblical account of the Sinai covenant and certain international treaties from the various Late Bronze Age civilizations of the Near East. Due to the convenient location of these treaties in history, there is the probability of cultural and literary contact with Israel (through Egypt and Canaanite city-states such as Ugarit) ; moreover, because of a consistent historical emphasis within the specifically Hittite treaty format, their suzerain treaties have been singled out for special study. Within these Hittite treaties a basic literary structure has been uncovered ; the form is well known and amply documented in countless excellent studies on aspects of covenant theology. G. Mendenhall suggested as characteristic the follow- ing elements: introductory preamble, historical prologue, stipulations, provi- sion for the deposit of the text and periodic public reading, the invocation of gods as witnesses, and cursing and blessing formulae.3 With slight modifica- tion this pattern has received wide acceptance and many parallel details have been discovered throughout the entire Old Testament and New. After initial acclaim, however, there followed a period of more mature reflection, and the difficulties involved in a quick application to the biblical text began to surface. Although distinct similarities with this treaty are often visible and parallel details striking when its format is compared with the ceremony of Jos 24 and Dt (and indeed the entire Pentateuch as shaped by the final priestly redactors), differences also exist and these become sig- nificant when the text selected for comparison is Ex 19-24. Among the first to offer serious objection to any extended similarity between the international treaties and the Sinai narrative was D. McCarthy.4 His analysis of the various international treaties and the historical evolu- 2 O. Eissfeldt, The Old Testament: An Introduction (tr. P. R.

Others such as M. Andrew have joined in denying any direct dependence of the Sinaitic narrative on the Hittite treaty structure.® The fact of the matter is that Ex 19-24 in its existent form seems to offer minimal similarity to that treaty format, and even many of those details which might suggest an echo of such literary and cultural dependence are themselves of a secondary nature. Sinai Revisited A critical reading of the account of Israel's primal experience of Yahweh has often suggested the presence of pericopes apparently inserted into the narrative by later redactors. These must be momentarily set aside if one is to attain a fuller appreciation of the theological affirmations inherent in the original experience of Sinai. The initial geographical locations (Ex 19:1-2) have been supplied by the Priestly Tradition. Though they may well incorporate original historical data, subsequent reformulations in view of contemporary pilgrimage pat- terns and preoccupations with liturgical calendars no longer allow certainty in this matter. This is further complicated by the acknowledged gradual assimilation of sacred traditions into larger literary complexes of material associated with central shrines of earlier or later importance.6 The next literary unit encountered is that of Ex 19:3-8(9) which is almost universally admitted as originally independent ; only later was this passage preserved by inserting it into its present position in the text,7 The 5 J. Stamm and M. Andrew, The Ten Commandments in Recent Research ( SBT 2/2; Naperville: Allenson, 1967) 62: "The conclusion from this evidence would seem to be that a direct dependence of Israel on the Hittites is not likely." Cf. E. Gersten- berger, "Covenant and Commandment," JBL 84 (1965) 47: "Consequently the commandments which control the affairs of 'everyone and his neighbor' cannot be explained by analogy with the 'treaty stipulations' which aim at regulating the relations between the covenant partners alone"; E. Nielsen, " The Ten Commandments in New Perspective ( SBT 2/7; Naperville: Allenson, 1968) 131: "Let the 'Hittite treaty formula' be as old as it likes. It is only the decalogue in its secondary form, and in its late secondary form at that, which, in respect of this form, corresponds to some extent to the pattern of the treaty formula." 6 For the primitive relationship of covenant to the shrine at Qadesh, cf.

The six verses include an obvious self- contained unit of action: a summons by God (vs. 3b), the actual offer of a covenant with Israel (vss. 4-6), the gathering of Israel to deliver the message (vs. 7), followed by the solemn positive response of the people (vs. 8a) and the report of Moses to Yahweh (vs. 8b). Moreover, the manner of expression and terminology suggests a complete covenant formula in abbreviated but essential terms: the historical prologue (vs. 4), the general stipulation (vs. Sa: Hauptgebot ), blessings for obedience (vss. 5b- 6a) and the acceptance in solemn assembly by the people (vss. 7-8). 8 The refined poetic parallelism evident in the text serves to single out this section as unique in form and style. The anticipated action of Moses as covenant- mediator before his selection as such by the people (Ex 20:18-21), and the people's acceptance of the covenant before the ritual conclusion and imparting of the law confirm the judgment that this is an independent unit.9 Certainly the repetition of fundamentally the same words of acceptance (Ex 19:8; 24:3,8) is striking. Although Noth ascribes this pericope to the Deuteronomic tradition, it generally receives the label of E today.10 This text may well have originated at one of the shrines where Sinaitic traditions were preserved. At most one might deduce that the terminology and the theological affinities suggest a northern origin, though probably not Shechem since there is no explicit mention of the curses and blessings which seem so deeply rooted in the cult of that sanctuary. Barring the interwoven duplication of traditions describing the phenomena which accompanied the theophany (storm in Ex 19:16 and volcano in vs. 18) and the equally evident secondary expansions of the demand for cultic purity and respect for the sacred (Ex 19:21-25), the remainder of the chapter is deeply embedded in the faith-experience of Israel, and al- W.

Vs. 9 would be a transition supplied by the editor who first inserted the pericope into its present position. 8 Moran, "Kingdom," 18-19; Muilenburg speaks of the "covenant message form" as oracular opening (vs. 3b), proclamation of mighty acts (vs. 4), and covenant condition (vss. 5-6) in "Form," 354; Gerstenberger reduces a legal covenant to three fundamental elements of agreement, stipulations and curse in "Covenant." 45. 9 McCarthy, Treaty , 156; Noth, Exodus , 154, 157. 10 Ibid., 157; cf.

The next object of special consideration is the decalogue (Ex 20:1-17). A great deal of energy has been spent on this code from a form-critical and traditio-historical as well as theological perspective. A comparison between Ex 20 and Dt 5 indicates that the form preserved in Exodus, while perhaps fundamentally more ancient, shows signs of the most recent final redaction as seen, for example, in the motivation for Sabbath observance which is patterned after the P account of creation.11 Though an increasing number argue for the Mosaic origin of the decalogue,12 all admit some reshaping of the tradition in the decalogue's long history. The initial proclamation formula with its first-person singular expression (Ex 20:2-6) is at variance with the imperative quality of the remainder. In all probability a shorter series of apodictic commands were embodied in the present decalogue form ; any reconstruction, however, is difficult and hypothetical at best. The prohi- bitions themselves incorporate material whose roots lie buried in a pre- sedentary culture; the proclamation formulae were supplied when these laws were brought into relationship with the theophany at Sinai and pre- sented in the form of a direct command.13 Several contemporary authors suggest an independent origin for the decalogue, but the determination of the primitive Sitz im Leben poses considerable difficulty.14 Given the secondary quality of the initial proclamation formula, Mowinckers sug- gested Torah or entrance liturgies become less likely and Gerstenberger's traditional clan wisdom seems worthy of serious investigation and reflec- tion.15 In any case, the decalogue as it exists today shows signs of literary reshaping, and therefore, its relationship to the primitive experience on Sinai must be carefully determined. Since the bond between theophany and commandment occurs so fre- quently throughout biblical literature,10 it would seem most unlikely to 11 Stamm-Andrew, The Ten Commandments , 15-16. 12 For an exhaustive bibliography, cf.

The decalogue may well bear the fingerprints of generations of editors and may have been inserted in this context by way of substitution for another code;17 nevertheless the mere presence of the code in its existing context is an expression of the faith of the editors who saw a necessary correspondence between some expression of the Divine Will and the primitive experience of Sinai. The freedom with which Israel was able to handle this code is indicative of the fact that its value was ultimately based upon something more fundamental in Israel's faith- experience, and that a certain cultural and literary latitude was possible in the historical unfolding of Yahweh's Will. In the critical quest for the original form and content of the Sinaitic experience, consequently, it seems necessary to postulate some articulation of law, but at the same time to assert that law as the effect of a logically prior element. It has been suggested that the passage immediately following the decalogue in which Moses is designated mediator by the people (Ex 20:18-21) has been shifted from its prior location by the insertion of the current form of the decalogue, and thus has become an introduction to the more extensive Covenant Code (Ex 21:1-23: 19). 18 Embodied in the intention of the text may well be an effort to authenticate the liturgical covenant mediator of later generations. Although the accidentals of form and textual position may be secondary, the basic tradition of Moses as mediator is so deeply rooted in the historical consciousness and faith-awareness of Israel that the verses simply cannot be rejected as devoid of historical reference. The position of the decalogue prior to the election of Moses as intermediary, while bristling with logical and literary inconsistency, serves to underline the priority of divine initiative in the covenantal dialogue with Israel. The regulations preserved in Ex 20:22-26 contain material which is very ancient. The prohibition of idols is an echo of the absolute claim of Yahweh expressed in the decalogue and pervading the entire theology of trate the bond between theophany and some sort of commandment: from J Gen 2:15-17; 3:8-19; 4:8-16; 12:1-3; from E 15:1-16,17-21 ; 22:1-14; from P 6:11-22; 9:1-17; 17:1-14; from D the entire book of Dt. The assignment of sources follows G. Von Rad, Genesis : A Commentary (tr. J. H. Marks; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1961). 1* Rowley concludes that Ex 34:14-28 represents the primitive Kenite decalogue, originally part of the J tradition of Sinai and later replaced by E's code (Ex 20:1-17) ; cf.

Nielsen states that Ex 20:22-26 and 23:10-19 formed the original "words" of Yahweh on Sinai and that "the existing 'classic' decalogue of Ex 20:1-17 had originally no textual connection with Ex 19-24": cf.

The entire five-verse unit represents a secondary literary expression of values inherent in the Sinaitic theophany ; in their present context they serve to introduce the subsequent Code and to place it within a liturgical frame of reference, thus conferring added authority to it. The Code of the Covenant (Ex 21 : 1-23: 19) is a collection of laws for the most part casuistic (Ex 21:1: misepãtím) ; they deal with many aspects of community life: slavery (21:1-11), homicide and bodily injury (21:12-32), property (21:33-22:15), sexual conduct (22:16-19), miscellaneous matters (22:20-23,13) and cult (23:14-19). The composite quality of this collection, its clear relationship with the legal mores of the Ancient Near East, and its sedentary tone suggest that it was formulated after the entrance of Israel into Canaanite territory and civilization, though isolated individual prescrip- tions may reflect the social ethos of an earlier age. The Code probably cir- culated in an independent form prior to its insertion into the text of Ex 19-24.20 The presumption throughout the collection is that of town life which obviously incorporated the human values and social concerns de- manded of nomadic existence. The final editors may well have transferred the Code of the Covenant from another prior location in the biblical narra- tive, but there can be no doubt that it represents a secondary addition to the Sinai account.21 The blessings at the end of the Covenant Code (Ex 23:20-33) have 1» Von Rad, O.T.

A closer study, however, indicates that the blessings refer, not to the newly established covenant, but rather to future obedience to the "messenger of Yahweh."22 A general Deuteronomic quality is perceptible in the terminology (sir*'a [hornets?] in Ex 23:28) and in the concern for the land about to be possessed.28 The lack of context for the instruction suggests that the blessings were attached to the Code prior to the insertion of both into the Sinai narrative of Ex 19-24. The manner in which the Code of the Covenant is clearly distinguished from the decalogue offers a theological commentary on the value of this collection. Social custom and mores are gathered and presented under the egis of divine command and somehow related to the more universal impera- tives of the decalogue. Their normative value consists in the divinely sanc- tioned human relationships incorporated in the social customs and endures as long as those social customs retain their vitality among the people. In the final form of the narrative the decalogue is imposed in a permanent fashion, whereas the Code of the Covenant is not ; as a result, each social evolution requires a corresponding new form of life in covenant with Yahweh. Both decalogue and Code, however, in their present form are secondary additions and look to another element of the covenant for ultimate significance and value. The narrative concludes with an interwoven double account of the ritual by which the covenant on Sinai was solemnly established. In Ex 24:1-2,9-11 the narrative describes a solemn pilgrimage to the mountain top where a covenantal meal with Yahweh was celebrated; this strand of tradition may have been associated with the storm theophany (Ex 19:16) and more remotely with the story of the sacred meal with Jethro, the Midian priest (Ex 18: 1-27). 24 Also present is the account of a sacrificial blood-ritual 22 There is no doubt in my mind but that the frequent allusions to this figure are ultimately based on an historical cultic figure, an itinerant oracle-giver who received this title. The presence of this figure in ancient traditions (Jgs 6:11,12,20,21,22; 13:3, 6,9,13,15,16,17,18,20,21; etc.) and often in the context of holy places (Gen 16:7,9,10,11 for J's account of Hagar's dismissal at a desert oasis; cf. E's account in Gen 21:17) or objects (viz. the oaks of Mamre in J's version of the promise, Gen 18:1-16) is noteworthy. This is the nature of the caravan leader in Ex 14:19 (Noth: P) and the covenant mediator in Ex 23:20,23. To affirm a theological device employed by the Elohist tradition is to ignore the cultic background to many of these traditions and the multiplicity of priestly titles reflected in the biblical narratives. 23 G. Auzou, De la Servitude au Service (Paris: l'Orante, 1961) 263. Eissfeldt, however, states that these blessings were originally found after Ex 34:28 as part of the JE narrative; cf.

The com-</page><page sequence="9">1972] The Redeemer of Israel 9 (Ex 24:3-8) by which the covenant was concluded at the foot of the moun- tain; this in turn may be related to the volcanic elements included in the theophany account (Ex 19:18). It is no longer possible to select either tradition as historically prior and thus more indigenous to the original historical experience on Sinai. Although the literary expressions of vss. 9-11 may be more primitive and their objective significance more mysteriously elusive in terms of the actual historical event, the blood-ritual is equally fundamental and ancient in the cultic praxis of Israel. Furthermore, the two rituals are by no means mutually exclusive, since every meal presumed some sacrificial preparation (with a ritual pouring of the blood) just as the mention of "communion ( sHãmím ) sacrifices" (Ex 24:5) included a sacred meal in the presence of the deity so honored. Perhaps the most feasible solution, then, is to presume that both traditions reflect authentic dimensions of the original rite and, while acknowledging a divergent literary history for each of these cultic aspects, to assert a common origin for both elements in the actual rite of the original Sinaitic experience. In summary, then, the account of the covenant on Sinai as narrated in Ex 19:1-24:11 contains passages which have been critically examined by many scholars and designated as originally independent units: Ex 19:3-8; 20:1-17; 21:1-23:19 (33). Other portions of the text offer indications of editorial reworking, at least in terms of the existing literary expression: Ex 19:1-2; 19:21-25; 20:18-21; 20:22-23,24-26. Therefore, the original primitive experience on Sinai, as reflected in the remaining sections of the account in Exodus, contained these items: 1) the personal mediation of Moses during the theophany described with storm and volcanic allusions (Ex 19:10-20); 2) some expression of Divine Will; 3) the people's solemn acceptance of the Presence and the Will within the context of a sacrificial meal (Ex 24:1-2,9-11 and 3-8). The nature of this material is such that pertinence to any of the Pentateuchal traditions is no longer possible ; both J and E are represented here.25 The basic elements of liturgical celebration are visible: parentic invitation with cooperation of the participants, proclamation of the Divine Will, and bined accounts of the sacred meal and selection of assistants in the work of applying oracular responses of Yahweh to the people's needs is interesting; this may supply the commandment element otherwise present in the blood ritual (Ex 24:3-8) but absent from Ex 24:1-2,9-11. Note that for Eissfeldt Ex 24:1-2,9-11 is a prime example of the L (Lay) Source; cf. The Old Testament , 193-194. Noth asserts that Ex 24:9-11 is "fairly unanimously regarded as the oldest form of the tradition concerning the act of covenant making" ; cf. "The Laws," 39-40. In the same context he notes the absence of law in this passage (Ex 24:9-11) or in passages attributable to similar strands in the tradition; this seems mistaken in the light of Ex 18. 25 Noth affirms a primitive E account in Ex 19: 3a, 16b, 17, 19; 20:18,19-21; 24:1-2, 9-11 in Exodus , 197; cf.

As Noth indicated so clearly, the same form can be discovered in Dt and in Jos 24, and was used consistently in the Covenant Renewal Festival.26 The Family of Yahweh It was stated above that the total narrative of Ex 19-24 does not offer sufficient basis for the conclusion that it had been modeled after the struc- ture of the Hittite treaties from the 15th through the 13th centuries B.C.27 The historical prologue is minimal and serves as identification rather than motivation for consequent commands (Ex 19:4; 20:2) and the blessings and curses are equally minimal and implicit, without any inherent relation to the actual series of stipulations included in the text (Ex 20:5 ; 23:22,25- 26,27,28) 28 The judgment regarding the lack of treaty format is all the more valid for the elements which remain germanely rooted in the Sinai tradition after the secondary insertions and redactional passages have been momentarily put aside. With the removal of the secondary legal collections and the admission that we no longer have the precise formulation of the original Mosaic com- mandments (whose value then becomes dependent upon another element), the emphasis of the narrative falls upon the rites. This stress is re-enforced by the fact that the tradition preserved in Ex 24:1-2,9-11 does not mention stipulations of any sort. Given the importance of the rituals for understanding the genuine sig- nificance of the Sinaitic relationship between Yahweh and Israel, it becomes imperative to probe their affirmations carefully. Essential to any treaty covenant is the oath by which the performance of the stipulations is guaranteed.29 Note that the mere presence of witnesses (in this case the massëbâ of Ex 24:4) does not constitute an oath; there is required the further element of self-curse or punishment (either verbally articulated or symbolically invoked) for any violation. Since such an oath is clearly absent from the affirmation of popular acceptance (Ex 24:3,7), and since 26 "The Problem of the Hexateuch," The Problem of the Hexateuch and Other Studies (tr. E. W.

Hillers, Covenant: The History of a Biblical Idea (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1969) 46: "Our analysis of treaty texts has made it clear that blessing and curse forms a standard, even essential, part of ancient covenants." 29 Ibid., 28: "An ancient treaty, then, is essentially an elaborate oath."

It is characteristic of the Israelite mentality to see a pro- found relationship between blood and life, even to the extent that one's life is envisioned as inherent in his blood, which is therefore sacred and reserved to God alone (Gen 9:4-6; Lev 17:11). To share the same blood was to share the same life and, thus, in some way to belong to the same family relationship.82 In the primitive experience on Sinai, therefore, the sprinkling of the blood of the communion sacrifices and holocausts (nar- rated in Ex 24:6,8 without any ominous overtones) served to create a family bond ; the people of Israel, with Moses as guide and mediator, came to understand that Yah weh had accepted them as His own relatives and kinsfolk. The same election is sacramentalized in the meal of Ex 24: II.83 The implications of that theological intuition in terms of Israel's liturgical practice and social institutions are many.

In any case, if a blood-ritual existed prior to Sinai, its meaning would have been radically intensified through the revelation of that event. A similar insight is suggested in reference to the use of blood in the consecration of Aaron and his sons as priests. The blood of the "ram of consecration" (Lev 8:22) was placed on their right ear lobes, thumbs and toes (Ex 29:20; Lev 8:23-24) and sprinkled on their garments (Ex 29:21 ; Lev 8:30). The clear relationship to the manner of presenting a "com- munion sacrifice" (Lev 3) and reconciling cleansed lepers (Lev 14:14) indicates a covenant and reaffirmed union of life. In the case of Aaron that special affinity was to be expressed through attentive hearing of Goďs oracle and behavior consistent with that bond; the extremities of the privileged right side represent the total human response to the all-embracing covenant.36 It becomes very easy to understand the logical connection be- tween the family life with Yahweh established in covenant and the blessing of life for obedience to that covenant or the "death sentence" for a serious crime against cultic or social stipulations.37 In suggesting that the initial experience on Sinai was the revelation that Israel had been accepted as the family of Yahweh Himself, one realizes that this is in some sense a return to the suggestion made by Wellhausen who felt that a primitive totem ritual lay at the base of the Judaic religion.88 Although the final affirmation may show some superficial similarities, the approach and frame of reference is totally different. No longer is any Hegelian evolution invoked from crass totemism to sophisticated prophetic spiritualism, nor is the law seen as a postexilic priestly blurring of Israel's religious vision. The affirmation is genuine sacramental symbolism, not 34 Studies in Old Testament Sacrifice (Cardiff: U. of Wales, 1964) 48-51. w Ibid., 15-26. 36 M. Noth, Leviticus: A Commentary (tr. J. E.

The emphasis falls upon the theophany and faith- response which truly transforms Israel from within. The law is the social consequence of God experienced. Yahweh the Redeemer Merely to establish a familial relationship between Yahweh and His people is not sufficient; any appreciation of the theological dimensions of that bond also requires an understanding of kinship as expressed in the nomadic culture of the Late Bronze age. Certainly every family bond im- poses certain mutual obligations, but the form and expression of those duties as well as the social mores surrounding them will vary considerably from age to age and from culture to culture. For that reason it is also necessary to probe the significant aspects of early Israelite family life and to determine their implications for the primitive understanding of Yahweh as kinsman. Contemporary studies of the history of the tribes of Israel and form- critical studies have shown the complexities of the historical evolution of the Twelve Tribes.39 Only a limited group participated in the revelation on Sinai, and their trip from Egypt to the mountain in terms of time and route is far from clear. This much seems certain, however, in spite of Von Rad's arguments to the contrary: basically the same group arrived at Sinai as had previously experienced the Exodus from Egypt.40 As a result of Daube's patient and imaginative scholarship, it is apparent that certain legally recognized social customs existed in Israel which in turn exercised considerable influence on the Exodus narratives.41 The un- known God was understood and described in terms of the known man and his world. One such institution of special import is the figure of the go'ēl, the "redeemer" or "recoverer" who is so called because as next of kin he bears the solemn obligation to step in and recover any enslaved relative (or property) and to restore him to his proper position within the family. Daube's striking and perceptive study is based upon the universal prac- tice of slavery in the Ancient Near East, the certainty that the social prac- tice in question does indeed precede the actual narrative as well as on the extensive references to this legally recognized custom throughout the OT 80 M.

As a consequence, and in keeping with the social custom of the day, they became His slaves in turn. The entire narrative is subtly shaped around the social legislation and actual practice of the people regarding this institution in the family. The case is a good one; the arguments are convincing and well docu- mented. Nevertheless, the question of the origin of the image of Yahweh remains. While an occasional anthropomorphic allusion might be ascribed to the poetic talent of an individual prophet or priestly psalmist in Israel, the consistent and pervading invocation of this image cannot have originated in so casual a manner. The only feasible origin for so bold an image of Yahweh as "redeemer" and "next of kin" must have been that primordial event of revelation by which the people of Israel perceived themselves as united in family bonds with the God they served. That event was Sinai. In the wake of that extraordinary experience and in the light of their newly found faith, these people under the leadership of Moses reflected upon their recent deliverance from Egypt and understood that it had been Yahweh Himself, though unknown at the time, Who had brought them forth from "a house of slaves." As a self-designated relative, He had freely bound Himself by covenant loyalty ( hesed ) to show concern for His family and had expressed that bond by liberating them from the oppression of Pharoah. The ancient hymn of Moses expresses the faith of Israel in con- fessing, "By Your mercy ( hesed ) You lead the people whom You redeemed « 1 Kgs 16:11; Jer 32:7,8; Ru 2:20; 3:9,12; etc. 43 Although no exhaustive list is intended, an attempt will be made to offer some indication of usage in the Exodus narrative, the Code of the Covenant and some other legal collections: ' abad "to do a slave's work" (Ex 1:13,14; 5:18; 6:5, 14:5,12; 21:2; Lev 25:39; Dt 15:12) ; 'inna "to afflict a dependent" (Ex 1:11,12; 22:21-22) ; fa'aq "cry, petition for legal justice" (Ex 2:23; 3:7,9; 14:10,15; 22:23); šillah "dismiss into freedom" (Ex 3:20; 4:21,23; 5:1,2; 6:1,11; 21:26; Dt 15:13-14); yafa' "go out into freedom" (Ex 11:8; 12:31; 14:8; 21:2; Lev 25:41); and ga'al "recover, redeem" (Ex 6:6; 15:13; Lev 25:25-26,48-49,51). Note that this terminology is found in all the Pentateuchal sources. *4 Such details are the dispute with Pharoah regarding who is to go free (Lev 25:41: children to accompany redeemed parents) and what possessions may be brought out (Dt 15:13-14) ; cf. Daube, Exodus Patterns , 22-23, 47-61.</page><page sequence="15">1972] The Redeemer of Israel IS ( ga'al )."45 Implicit, though nonetheless real in this verse (Ex 15:13), is the bond of family relationship out of which God worked. The fact that the concept of Yahweh as g o' ēl does not appear explicitly in either the existing account of the Sinaitic covenant or its reconstructed primitive form (as suggested above) does not pose any real objection to the fundamental suggestion of this study. The fundamental affirmation of Ex 19-24 is the fact of family relationship, not liberation; it is to be antici- pated that the image of gô'ël will be evident primarily in the accounts of the deliverance just as Daube has demonstrated. Even so, the Semitic concept of redeemer does find some echoes in the repeated references to slavery in the decalogue (Ex 20:2,5,9,10) and in the family responsibilities which form the base for the relationships sanctioned by the covenant. In this context the special blessings of life for those who honor their parents (Ex 20:12) takes on special significance. Herein lies another argument against viewing the account of Sinai as a vassal treaty with Yahweh, for as Gersten- berger has pointed out, the concern of such treaties is the relationship be- tween the covenant partners alone; stipulations which deal with the bond "between a man and his neighbor" without explicit reference to the Overlord and his concerns, cannot be explained by analogy with treaty stipulations.46 The theological ramifications of this Sinai-event perceived as an adoption into Yahweh's family are many. With the redemption from slavery every sphere of life falls under the authority of the new Owner and a new morality based on total service is postulated from the very beginning of Israel's existence as a nation. The decalogue can only furnish signposts on the margin of that service.47 Moreover, an enduring quality is injected into the social customs of Israel, and the various family institutions achieve a divine- right unknown in other religious traditions. This explains the ease with which compilations of social laws such as the Code of the Covenant (Ex 21:1-23:33), though admittedly historically and culturally conditioned, could be inserted into the Sinaitic narrative; in this way the Code could assume the force of an expression of the Will of God Himself. This also explains some of the pain involved in the shift from the customs entailed in tribal life to those demanded by a monarchical government. From the very beginning of the Mosaic tradition, social legislation was a matter of prime concern because God Himself had assumed and thereby sanctioned personal obligations of this nature ; any consequent prophetic action, such 45 N.

Theology , I, 194-195.</page><page sequence="16">16 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 34 as that of Amos or Micah, was merely a re-affirmation of the ideal which lay at the very core of Israel's faith. Even in this frame of reference, the initiative remains obviously that of God Who freely chose to enter a family covenant with His people. To say that salvation depends upon living within that family is to risk a theoretical Pelagianism. Rather one shows that one has genuinely accepted the offer of kinship by living accordingly; to do otherwise is to demonstrate that salvation was never really accepted at all and this is the self-destructing rejection made possible by the God-given liberty which accompanies the offer of covenant. This entire discussion sheds considerable light on the role of Moses in the historical evolution of the belief of Israel. Contrary to the thought pro- voking suggestions of Moran, it is not to Moses that the treaty format is to be ascribed, since neither the existing narrative (Ex 19-24) nor the reconstructed original show signs of direct influence from that theology or that literary structure.48 Rather, in divine providence it was the momentous achievement of Moses to perceive Yah weh as desiring to form one family with His people, as intervening in history to maintain their freedom for His service and thus revealing the bonds of fraternal justice and fidelity to the oppressed as primal expressions of His Will for all time. The God of Moses was Yah weh, a God of radical justice, not caprice, a generous and loyal kinsman to those who truly love Him (Ex 20:6) and an ever present redeemer in times of oppression. The continuity with "the God of the Fathers," deeply concerned with the social evolution of the nomadic groups represented in the patriarchal narratives and identified with people rather than things however sacred, is immediately apparent.49 The contribution of Moses is a radical spiritual impetus which perceived the intrinsic relation- ship between the nature of Yahweh and the demands of social justice as well as the essential difference between the human values of prime impor- tance and the specific cultic forms (not mentioned in the decalogue of Ex 20:1-17) within which those human bonds are expressed and sanctified. At the very heart of the matter is the identification of the Kingdom of God and the Family of Man ; Israel was called to provide mankind with a pattern of life which alone measures the capacity of the human heart. That intuition, 48 "De Foederis Mosaici Traditione," VD 40 (1962) 3-17. 49 Special attention is drawn to the classic study by A. Alt, "The God of the Fathers," Essays , 3-100. Elsewhere de Vaux makes a point of describing the gradual union of separate clans under the artificial bond of genealogies. All tribesmen were united by blood relationship, real or supposed, and the ensuing family bonds may have been a significant aspect of the pre-Mosaic religion; cf. Ancient Israel , Its Life and Institutions (tr. J. McHugh; New York: McGraw-Hill, 1961) 4-12.</page><page sequence="17">1972] The Redeemer of Israel 17 profoundly simple and simply profound, merited for Moses a lasting place of glory in the traditions of Israel. Some Developments in History Only at a later date, after the tribes had come forth out of Egypt and been unified by the Sinaitic experience, did these nomadic groups become assimi- lated with the various Amorite clans previously settled in Canaan ; at that time their relationship with Yah weh took on the form of the international treaties. This literary structure with its extended historical prologue (Dt 1-3; 4-11) and oath of acceptance with blessings and curses (Dt 27:9- 29:29) then became the customary form for expressing the relationship between Yahweh and His people.50 The transformation may be ascribed, at least in part, to the new images of authority and power encountered upon the assimilation of a sedentary life amid the city-states of Canaan. Whereas previously Yahweh had been worshipped as a Divine Sheikh Whose sacred tent moved with His people, now He became a Melek after the model of the rulers of Palestine, and as such entered into covenant with His vassals on the land and assumed their fortress-sanctuaries as His dwellings. Given the ancient relationship between some of the tribes and the Shechemites (Gen 34) and the identification of the Deuteronomic treaty sites with the area of Shechem (Dt 27:12-13; Jos 24:1) which boasted a temple in honor of El Berit (Jgs 9:46), 51 it seems probable that the transformation from Yahweh as Relative to Great King took place within the traditions of that sanctuary. The consequent appearance of a human king as leader for Goďs people was an almost inevitable development as a consequence of this theol- ogy as well as a response to military pressures, and although the transition occasioned some pain, the bond between the image of God and the social institutions was again quickly formed. Only during the exile, when the people of Israel found themselves in foreign territory once more, to some degree imprisoned in a culture and society alien from their own, did they turn to Yahweh as Redeemer once more. With a fresh burst of theological enthusiasm and insight, the unknown prophet of the exile resurrected images long dormant and spoke of a new exodus through the wilderness and a figure who would be Yahweh's servant 80 Even here the classical treaty form is combined with a farewell speech of Moses ; cf.

In the renewed profession of faith in Yahweh as Creator and Redeemer, Deutero-Isaiah envisioned creation as the first intervention by which the world was freed from chaos and all men were formed in the image of God Himself, sharing His responsibility for establishing harmony and fraternal justice among all men. To list the countless ways in which this basic theme of Old Testament theology has influenced the understanding and the institutions of the New is hardly possible at this point. Christ's awareness of God as Father and His love for the poor are immediate references of continuity, as is Paul's unfolding understanding of the mystery of Christian redemption. Also, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly, the notion of dikaiosynë , "saving justice," so strongly affirmed by Paul as God-given, and so energetically pursued by his Pharisaic contemporaries, finds its first roots in the God Who revealed Himself to Moses on Sinai. In the light of this study the debt of the early Church to the theological perception and profound faith of Moses becomes ever clearer; because of Sinai they were able to understand the Lord's injunction to "seek first the Kingdom of God and His justice" (Mt 6:33) and to rejoice with Paul at the liberating summons to become the servants of God (Rom 6:22).
