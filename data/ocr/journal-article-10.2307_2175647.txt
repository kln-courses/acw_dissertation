<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS. L'anrn'e philosophique. Publi'e sous la direction de F. PILLON, ancien re'dacteur de la Critique phi/osojhique. Cinquieme annee, I894. Paris, Felix Alcan, I895. -pp. 324. The fifth number of the Annie philosophique, the organ of the French ' criticists,' resembles its immediate predecessor in the nature of its articles. M. Renouvier, who, in the fourth volume, gave an exposition of the teachings of Jesus, continues his New Testament researches with an interesting "Philosophical Study on the Doctrine of St. Paul " (pp. 1-54). The article belongs to the domain of theology, and does not, therefore, fall within the scope of this REVIEW. M. L. Dauriac's contribution, entitled " Neutral Phenom- enalism " (pp. 55-84), is an exhaustive critique of ?tmile Boirac's book, 'IdtXe du Pphenomene. Then follows one of a series of essays on the evolution of idealism, which the editor of the journal, M. F. Pillon, began in i892. The present treatise bears the title, " L'ltvolution de 1' ide'alisme au XVIII siecle. - Spinozisme et Malebranchisme" (pp. 84-199). The volume concludes with the customary annual review of the philosophical books that have been published in France during the previous year (pp. 201-32i). This bibliographical part is the work of the editor, who, with a few strokes of the pen, outlines the essential features of a book and adds brief but pertinent criticisms. The eighty-six reviews give one a fair idea of the progress of philosophical thought in France. One contribution in particular demands the attention of the student of philosophy, and deserves the closest study. I refer to Pillon's dissertation on " Spinozism and Malebranchism." Ever since the physicist and mathematician Dortons de Mairan characterized Malebranche's system as Spinozism, the historians of philosophy have spoken of the resemblance existing between the teachings of the father of the Oratory of Jesus and those of the outcast Jew. Hegel expresses an opinion in his Vorlesungen uiber die Geschichte der Philosophie (p. 41 i) that seems to have become traditional with historians of philosophy: "Es ist Spinozismus in anderer, frommer, theologischer Form. Nur dieser Form wi/len hat seine Fhiilosoph/ie nicht den Widerspruch gefunden den Spinoza fand;</page><page sequence="2">644 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IV. und dem Afalebranche ist darum auch nicht der Vorwurf des Athleismus gemacht worden." Victor Cousin dubs Spinoza, " unfr're de MaZe- branche dans la famille Cartisienne," and calls Malebranche the "Christian Spinoza." Kuno Fischer acquiesces in these views "Malebranche's Lehre, richtig verstanden, ist die Lehre Spinoza's" (Geschichte der neuern Philosophie, I, 2, p. 84). Malebranche himself emphatically denied the charge of Spinozism in his correspondence with Mairan, and pointed out the differences between himself and le miserable Spinoza. But his protests were ignored. Our historians, almost without exception, proclaim Mairan as the victor of the contest against the old philosopher, who, they say, puts an end to the controversy simply because he feels that he has been worsted in debate. M. Pillon does not accept the verdict of the histories of philosophy. Malebranche's views have, he believes, been misunderstood, and therefore misrepresented. Mairan is so steeped in Spinozism that he is utterly unable to grasp Malebranche's distinction between intelligible and real extension, a distinction on which the entire system of Malebranche hinges. Malebranchism is not Spinozism, and this Correspondence, which is almost universally regarded as proof of the contrary, has been "the object of superficial, and often second-hand judgments, which it is necessary to correct" (p. 89). Pillon first examines the eight letters which passed between de Mairan and Malebranche. It appears that the physicist appeals to the philosopher for help against Spinoza's system, " whose arguments are so convincing and whose consequences so discouraging." The whole trouble lies in this, answers the French Plato, that Spinoza "takes the ideas of the creatures for the creatures themselves, the ideas of the bodies for the bodies, and supposes that we see these in themselves." He mistakes the intelligible world, which is the immediate object of the mind, for the world of created extension. " Hence he confounds God or the Supreme Reason, which holds the ideas that enlighten the mind (qui renferme les idtes qui 'c&amp;airent les esprits), with the work which the ideas represent (l'ouvrage que Zes idles rep res enten)." The distinction which Malebranche draws here, and has always drawn, between the intelligible world and the real or created world is what differentiates his system from Spinoza's. De Mairan's second letter betrays its author's utter inability to grasp this thought. He confesses that he can form no clear concep- tion of what is meant by created or material extension and intelliible extension. It seems as though his study of Spinoza had filled his</page><page sequence="3">No. 6.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 645 mind with Spinozistic hallucinations. ' Intelligible space' he inter- prets to mean the infinite attribute of extension, which, of course, is in God or the divine substance; and 'created space' means for him the modifications of this infinite extension, Spinoza's modi. To see things in God, therefore, means to see his modes, the so-called created bodies, which are in God. Malebranche bravely attempts to make his meaning clear to his friend of the inquiring mind, but with poor success. The latter insists on projecting Spinozistic concep- tions into the master's views until the wearied philosopher, despairing of making himself understood, begs "q que nous cessions de travailler inutilement." And I cannot but feel that he is right. His meaning is perfectly clear. Malebranche is a successor of Descartes. If the soul and the body are two separate substances, the problem is: What is the relation between the two? This question was not satisfactorily answered by Descartes; it remained one of the great stumbling- blocks in his system. The Occasionalists took it up and offered the parallelistic solution. That was one way out of the difficulty. Malebranche also turns his attention to it. Thought is something utterly distinct from motion. How, then, can motion produce sensation ? How can the mind perceive the real extension, if such there be ? The thing is impossible. The bodies themselves cannot act upon the mind; " the world or created extension " " cannot be the immediate object of the mind, because it cannot affect the mind." Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. "The like sees the like only." What we see is not the real world, the real exten- sion, but a world of ideas, an intelligible world, intelligible or ideal space. These ideas are in God or the Supreme Reason; this God is spirit, with spiritual attributes only. The intelligible extension, which is in God, is not the extension " which you call extended substance, but the idea of the extended substance of which the world is composed." A real body or created space cannot affect the mind; nothing but an ideal body, the idea of a body, can do that. We see all things in God, not in an extended God, but in a thinking God, and the things we see are ideas, not the extended material objects themselves. Hence the real or material world is a terra incognita. Whether it exists or not, Malebranche does not know; he does not " prove that there is but one substance," he only proves "that there is but one Supreme Reason, which embraces the ideas of all possible beings," " which act directly upon the mind of man." He cannot be sure that matter exists although, as he says, he cannot</page><page sequence="4">646 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IV. doubt the existence of its idea. " For its idea is the real immediate object of my mind, and not matter itself, and I cannot know that this exists except through natural or supernatural revelation, as I have already explained in the Entretiens m~taphysiques. The intelli- gible world is in God, is God himself; for that which is in God is substantially all God (substantiellement tout Dieu)." "If God had destroyed the created world, and would continue to affect me as he now affects me, I should continue to see what I now see; and I should believe that this world still exists, since it is not this world that acts upon my mind." De Mairan's obtuseness would seem strange did we not remember his infatuation for Spinoza's logic. His letters prove that he is not seeking for information but fighting the battles of his master. Thus, in his fourth epistle, he shows signs of understanding what is meant by ' intelligible space.' " It 's an idea," he says; " now I grasp your thought. But ideas represent something, they presuppose an object. My idea of extension includes the notions of infinity, necessity, and eternity. Hence, real extension must possess these properties, and if it has the same properties as intelligible extension, why, the two must be identical. And so you get to Spinozism after all! But, if there is nothing corresponding to the idea of extension, if it is but an idea ' sans idtat,' in God, then there is no corporeal substance at all, no bodies, for extension is the essence of body." Male- branche wisely responds: Perhaps that is the case, "perhaps there is no object corresponding to the idea (no ideat). I see nothing but the idea immediately, and not the id~at; and I am persuaded that the idea has existed for "an eternity without an ideat. En tin mot, je Juis concevoir qu'i/ n'y en a point." Malebranchism is not Spinozism. Malebranche's God is pure thought ; his ideas, which are eternal and necessary, are the arche- types of all that exists; we see them, and only them, hence we see everything in God. Pillon is right in refusing to accept the verdict of the historians of philosophy. In a second chapter Pillon enumerates Cousin's errors in reference to this question. In Chapter III he undertakes to prove that the Spinozistic pantheism is derived from the Cartesian conception of matter. Extension is the attribute of a substance, matter. What- ever is extended is material. There can be no void anywhere, every- thing is full, everything is substance. Hence, matter is infinite and infinitely divisible. Hence, it is also eternal and necessary, and therefore untreated, or God. It is not always possible to tell exactly</page><page sequence="5">No. 6.] REVIEWS OF BOOOKS. 647 how one thinker developed his system from the conceptions of his predecessors. We cannot look into a man's mind. Spinoza's pan- theism is undoubtedly the logical sequel to the principles of Des- cartes. But I am not quite so sure that the chain of reasoning is that given by Pillon. The Spinozistic philosophy may be deduced from the Cartesian definition of the divine substance. The Tractatus brevis and Cogitata metaphysica seem to prove that Spinoza reached his system by consistently reasoning from Descartes' concepts of substance. " By substance we can understand nothing else than a thing which so exists that it needs no other thing in order to exist. And, indeed, the substance, which evidently needs no other thing, can be thought of as being one only, namely, God. But all others, we perceive, can exist only by the help of the concourse of God. And, therefore, the name ' substance' cannot belong to God and them univocally, as they say in the schools, that is, no signification of this name can be distinctly understood as common to God and to creatures " (Torrey's -Translation of Descartes' Princiypies, p. I94). Compare, also, Descartes' definition of attribute and mode. Pillon himself declares that " Cartesian substantialism, simplified by logic, and freed from secondary substances, becomes the monism of Spinoza " (p. I32). In Chapter IV Pillon more closely compares Spinoza and Des- cartes, especially as regards their psychological teaching. He is struck " with the extreme importance given to the representative character of the attribute of thinking." Spinoza's philosophy is realistic dogmatism. Logical priority is given to extension. The attribute of thought cannot be conceived without extension, which is its object, its idtat. Nothing can be more out of line with the ideal- istic conception, which makes extension relative to thought. There is truth in the remark, which Pillon repeats, that Spinoza really sub- ordinates the mental or ' representative ' series to the ' represented' series. Extension seems to receive more reality than the other factor. Mens is explained as idea corporis, not vice versa; it is the body that is taken as the real reality. In view of all this, it is incon- ceivable how any one can construe Spinoza's system as idealism, as Pollock has done. Pollock is severely criticised in Pillon's fifth chapter, and justly so, it seems to me. It is the business of the interpreter to give a correct exposition of his author's thought, not to develop it himself. Pollock draws certain conclusions from Spinoza's principles which may, no doubt, be logically deduced, but which the philosopher himself never drew. God has an infinite number of attri-</page><page sequence="6">648 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IV. butes, according to Spinoza. Now each attribute has a separate mind, a modification of thought that corresponds to it. Hence, the modes of thought are numerically equal to the modes of all the other attri- butes put together. This, says Pollock, gives the attribute of think- ing preeminence over the rest. Even if extension were blotted out, it would remain in thought, and thought would remain intact. The same reasoning applies to the other attributes. Hence, they are all superfluous, and nothing exists outside of thought and its modifica- tions. Furthermore, thought alone is both objective and subjective; the other attributes are objective only. Again, if the mental series is independent, then the corporeal series is useless. We do not lose anything by suppressing the modes of extension; we can get along with mind and ideas. This method of interpretation, pursued by Pollock, is, to say the least, a somewhat elastic one. One might, by means of it, produce some very pretty results in the history of phi- losophy. There is sometimes a wide difference between what a philosopher really says and means, and what the logic of the exposi- tor demands that he should have said. Had Spinoza followed Pollock's line of reasoning he would have been an idealist, but some- how he had his own ideas about things. In Chapter VI Pillon likens Spinoza's system to Eleatic pantheism, which he regards as the first stage in the evolution of idealism. Spinoza's substance is the '5v of the Eleatics. Spinozism reproduces all the features of Eleatic monism. It is true there are many points of resemblance between the two systems, and these are well brought out by the writer. But there are also differences that cannot be ignored, such as there naturally would be between a disciple of the Cartesian dualistic school and the Pre-Socratics, by whom mind and matter were not differentiated. The doctrine of attributes and modes is not found in Parmenides, and we cannot derive it from the Eleatics without employing force. In a seventh chapter Pillon returns to Malebranche. The latter, he says, is usually considered the disciple of Descartes. He is more than that; he is the reformer of Cartesianism. Pillon explains the Malebranchian psychology and theory of freedom; these certainly bear no resemblance to Spinoza's teachings. Chapter VIII contains Spinoza's criticism of Platonic anthropomorphism (which shows what a difference there is between Spinoza and Malebranche), and points out the difference between M.'s and S.'s ethical views. The last chapter takes up the different conceptions of space, and it is here urged that the ingenious theory of intelligible extension, advanced by</page><page sequence="7">No. 6.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 649 the great French idealist, " anticipated the transcendental aesthetic of Kant, and placed the distinction of space and matter, that is, the new cosmology, the new atomism, upon its true rational and philo- sophical basis, by destroying a p5riori . . . the Spinozistic necessity of an extended, eternal, and infinite substance" (p. 194). And, in order to be logical, Malebranche should have denied the objective reality of the attribute of extension and the existence of bodies. Pillon's article is a valuable contribution to the history of philoso- phy. It proves, I think, that the differences between Malebranche and Spinoza are greater than was imagined, and that the former is as independent a member of the Cartesian family as the latter. It is not true that Malebranche's system, rightly understood, is the sys- tem of Spinoza. We may, in a certain sense, call Malebranche a pantheist. All things (ideas) are seen in-God, all things (ideas) are in God; the universe, the world of ideas, is in God. This is ideal- istic pantheism. Perhaps there is a created world of bodies, perhaps there is not; at any rate, it does not affect us, we do not see it. We believe in such a world because Revelation tells us so. If God is the creator of heaven and earth, then all things are dependent on him; they are his manifestations, his creatures; all things are in God, and God alone is. This, too, would be pantheism, but it is a kind of pantheism that Christianity itself cannot escape. I see no objection to calling Malebranche a pantheist. What's in a name ? But he is not a Spinozist by any means. Spinozism is pantheism pantheism is not necessarily Spinozism. The student of the history of philosophy will be amply repaid for his study of Pillon's able work, which alone would make the fifth number of the Anniephizosophique of lasting value.
