<plain_text><page sequence="1">LOUIS PAMPLUME Gabriel Marcel: Existence, Being, and Faith One of the most striking aspects of the present philosophic scene in France is without a doubt the eclipse of the idealist tradition, so eminently represented before the last war by Leon Brunschwicg. Three currents of thought appear predominant: Marxist rationalism, Christian existential- ism, and atheist existentialism. Gabriel Marcel is, in France, the pioneer of what has come to be called Christian Existentialism. However, con- cerning this appellation (which he does not particularly like), it is advisable to point out from the start that the Marcelian philosophy does not depend on any dogmatic frame of reference. Its fundamental themes were elaborated before he was converted to Catholicism.' Of this vision of the world, oriented by and toward Christianity, a considerable number of aspects can retain their value even for those who might refuse to follow the author in his conversion. Like Kierkegaard and Pascal, Gabriel Marcel condemns all concern for systems. Starting with the Journal Metaphysique published in 1927,2 (the first treatise on existentialist philosophy to appear in France, 15 years before J.-P. Sartre's L'Etre et Le Neant) his entire work appears to be a quest motivated by a kind of anxious patience. In Position et Approches concretes du Myst're ontologique (1933), Etre et Avoir (1935), Du Ref us a' l'nvocation (1940), Homo Viator (1944), Le Mystere de l'Ete (Gifford Lectures delivered at the University of Aberdeen in 1949-1950 and published in 1951), the same themes, on highly varied subjects, are investigated, confronted and developed. The unity of this philosophy is perhaps of a musical rather than a logical order; it is less concerned with proving certain truths than with restoring a spirit of truth comparable to music of the soul. There is no question of outlining a philosophy whose very nature defies such an attempt. Neglecting the breadth of his work for the benefit of its intention, we shall limit ourselves to a presentation of certain essential ideas. 1 In 1929; Gabriel Marcel was born in 1889. 2 Published in 1927, the Journal metaphysique was written between 1914 and 1923; Gabriel Marcel is by-the-way the author of important dramatic works; he defines his philosophic and dramatic activities as "two slopes of the same height." 88</page><page sequence="2">LOUIS PAMPLUME Spiritual humility being in his eyes the prime virtue of the meta- physician, Gabriel Marcel employs a method of phenomenological anal- ysis. However, this analysis is never divorced from a critical reflection that questions the final meaning of experience. Rigor and fervor are joined in a process in which faithfulness to reality is nourished by anxiety for redemption. The problem of understanding and the hope for salvation are jointly formulated, in Gabriel Marcel, in ontologic terms. But this ontology declares itself from the outset alien to all intellectualism: it is based, not on the idea, but on the necessity of being. This "ontologic necessity," like the vital instinct of the spirit, explains itself in these terms: "It is necessary that there be, or that there shall have been, being- that everything be not reduced to a game of successive and inconsistent (this word is essential) appearances-or to recall a line from Shakespeare, to a tale told by an idiot; in this being, in this reality I avidly yearn to participate in some way."" A conception such as this situates itself at equal distance from traditional ontology and from criticism. Both value and reality are fused in being, but reflection, forsaking being in itself, is only associated with its concrete experience. "Happiness, love, in- spiration: it is, I believe, in relation to such experiences that the problem of being can be stated in an intelligible fashion."4 Being is defined, existentially, as the foundation of plenitude, "fulfilled waiting." The ontologic necessity clashes with the negations of a pessimism based on the unjustifiable aspects of our condition, in order to proclaim the metaphysical primacy of nothingness. But it clashes equally with idealist pretentions-or more, broadly, all rationalism-that deny all but psychological significance to a "desire" inseparable from rational truth. Gabriel Marcel shows that between idealism and pessimism there exists a secret bond, that they share the same attitude of "spectacular detach- ment" in the face of reality. However, the act of transcendence that restores to us the plenitude of being is neither an "irrational flight" nor a fideist wager-it identifies itself, in Gabriel Marcel, with the very act of reflection. The fundamental opposition of vacuity and plenitude, which replaces the traditional problem of the one and the many, dominates the totality of experience through which it is specified in coupled categories: existence and objectivity, mystery and problem, being and having, He and You. At the core of this bipolarity, reflection reveals a conflict of spiritual attitudes. One might say, in Bergsonian terms, that a closed consciousness is opposed to an open consciousness. On each level of experience, philo- sophic awakening, transformation from closed into open, renews the 3Position et Approches concretes du Mystere ontologique, p. 51 (Vrin, 1949). 4 Journal mnetaphysique, p. 202. 89</page><page sequence="3">Yale French Studies "tconjugal bond of man and life."5 The approach to faith can only be formulated as the ultimate entreaty of a metaphysic of communion. In its double aspect of philosophy of existence and philosophy of being, Gabriel Marcel's doctrine has declared itself in reaction against the idealist tradition. From the immanentist perspective, which is that of the "philosophy of consciousness" of a Leon Brunschwicg, faith in a transcendental and revealed God can only appear as a subjective inclina- tion, accounted for solely by psychology. "To believe or to verify," stated Leon Brunschwicg, "the alternative is ineluctable." It is interesting to note that Gabriel Marcel, as we shall see later, could easily adopt this formula for his own use though in a completely opposite sense. This dilemma set off in Gabriel Marcel a veritable intellectual rebellion, the origin, he states, of his entire philosophy. Can one strictly identify verity with verifiability? Are not the highest levels of spiritual life, creation, love, in general any experience of value, based on an apprehension of reality, implying the idea of a living truth transcending all logic. Idealism, on the other hand, discloses a deep-rooted metaphysical insufficiency before the prob- lem of existence. The presence of reality, "the existential sign" of the given is actually conjured away in favor of an act of rational determina- tion. Far from allowing itself to be deduced from essence or reduced to such a relationship, is not existence rather "an insuperability incapable of ever being transcended."" Gabriel Marcel realized that ignorance of existence and deprecation of faith, intrinsically united, both rest on the same postulate. The study of the linked problems of sensation and the union of body and soul reveals the irreducibility of existence to objec- tivity and opens the way for metaphysics. It encompasses, on the same level as sensory experience, a "mystery" in which faith emerges as the transcendent analogue. We naturally tend to consider our body as a perpetually available instrument, but reflection points out the fallacy of such a conception. This instrument is revealed as being nothing other than the means of extending or realizing an initial power of our body, our body appearing as that through whose function the instrument is possible. We cannot, therefore, think of it on an instrumentalist mode without unconsciously materializ- ing the soul that would use it. Generally speaking, I cannot attempt to determine the tie that unites me with my body without, by that very act, ideally placing myself outside of it: my body thus becomes an object of the world and ceases to be mine. At the same time, by reducing myself to bodiless and soulless eyes, I myself cease to exist. Without our taking 5Homo Viator, p. 116. '; Journal me'taphysique, p. XI 90</page><page sequence="4">LOUIS PAMPLUME the time to go into greater detail, it is manifest that "all communication between me and my body, when submitted to reflection, is revealed as unthinkable." I cannot comprehend it because it comprehends me. What is involved, in Marcelian terminology, is not a problem but a mystery. The immediate function, the "participation" by virtue of which I am my body defines my state of incarnation. Incarnation, "the central guiding point of metaphysical reflection," refutes both idealism and materialism. Materialism claims to identify me with that which is the exterior of my body insofar as it is an object. However, the body that I am is not an empiric reality, but constitutes, paradoxical as the expression may seem, a "body-subject." Contrary to the claims of idealism, the transcendental subject (abstract in the full sense of the word) possesses only a secondary reality relative to the incarnate subject. Born of a purely fictive detach- ment, "it is only on condition that it considers it is not."8 Existence and presence relate only to incarnation. Beings and things exist for me insofar as, sharing a similar immediation, they are, as it were, "united with me as my body." From the point of view of the body-object, sensation appears to be a communication, a message received and then translated. But the idea or a message in fact presupposes sensation and thus cannot account for it. Drawing on the Aristotelian concept of the sensitive faculty and the sensible quality, Gabriel Marcel sees in sensation an immediate presence, a communion which verifies the Claudelian pun: "Connaissance est co- naissance." Substituted for the problem of the existence of the exterior world is the notion of the "mystery of feeling." My body, in some way "in sympathy with things," plays the role of an absolute mediator in relation to the world: it is only "the nexus of my presence with world rendered manifest." The objective idea of the world as a spatial container finds its origin at the interior of a global presence in which my incarnation is rooted. As I cannot isolate myself in thought from my body, so can I not isolate myself from the universe, that "in affecting me, creates me;" except in fiction. Every cosmologic system, particularly a creationism that likens God to a sort of transcendental engineer, exemplifies a denial of our fundamental condition. Each individual presence, even that of one's own consciousness, relies on an absolute presence that is not manifest but is inherent and which "underlies the totality of our experience, of all experience, whatever it be."9 Incarnation, existence, presence, all manifest the primacy of the mystery in relation to the distinction between the subject and the object. 7Du Refus a l'Invocation, p. 30. 8 Ibid., p. 32. 9 Journal me'taphysique, p. 321. 91</page><page sequence="5">Yale French Studies Existence unites with that which exists, escaping all prediction and re- vealing itself in an uncharacterizable presence. Not that this presence is indeterminate; it transcends presentation, excludes all possibility of objective indication. In its fullness, this presence reveals a concrete infinity by its intimacy and its limitlessness. It is discerned as the fun- damental value that precedes judgment and defines existence through its ontologic dimension. Gabriel Marcel calls "primary reflection" the act of rupture by which the subject, in a moment of "spectacular detachment," affirms itself in denying itself. The Cartesian Cogito, "willed non-participation," is the metaphysical consecration. This is the objective world offered to our domination: theoretic domination achieved through the formulation of problems and the edification of understanding; practical domination through technical activity. However, neither the epistemologic subject nor its object "exists." In isolating myself from the world I cut myself off from myself; but by the same token, the world, changed into a ghostly spectacle, thins out, becomes empty, "finally suppresses itself through the simple fact of ignoring me." Objectivity is only an hypos- tasis of absence. In the words of one of the protagonists of l'Iconoclaste: "Knowledge exiles to infinity all that it imagines it embraces." Logico-mathematic thought, objective awareness, as such, retain com- plete value on a localized level; but all metaphysical pretentions on their part should be denounced as subversive, "anthropocentric in the second degree."10 By turning its back on abstract universality, philosophy does not as a result become an "affaire de confidence." The original uniqueness of the incarnate subject is established as irreducible either to the imper- sonality of a consciousness in general, or to the subjectivity of the empiric L. Metaphysics transcends the antinomy of logic and psychology, consists of this very transcendence, and finds its basis of concrete universality in an existential relationship of fate and vocation. Philosophy thus conceived does not rest methodologically on the precarious privilege of an intuition that claims to seize the immediate as a known quantity. The intentional character of pure sensitivity is only disclosed through the most rigorous study of the implications prior to experience. Refracted in every aspect of existence because it is situated at its base, original participation is found reestablished in its fullness by a critique of the conditions of the possibility of reflection itself. "This reflection of the second degree or to the second power," writes Gabriel Marcel, "is, in my eyes, philosophy itself in its specific effort of restoring 10 Da Refius a l'Invocation, p. 45. 92</page><page sequence="6">LOUIS PAMPLUME the concrete beyond the disjointed and disarticulated determinations of abstract thought."1 Approaching experience by means of its structure of reality, reflection results in the discovery of the ontologic meaning of incarnation in presence. Source of all anguish as of all plenitude, incarnation defines our state as a trial. Existence is not an empiric fact, but the modality of our union with being. Posing the problem of being in its totality (begin- ning this time with direct questioning), existentialist thought challenges pessimism. The pessimist proclaims: "It must assuredly be that being was; however, being is not-and I who recognize this fact am consequently nothing." There is no reality, asserts Gabriel Marcel, that cannot become the object of an annihilating analysis. Absolute pessimism is therefore theoretically always possible. Secondary reflection, reactivating the prob- lem, questions the validity of this seeming conclusion: does not all question of being ineluctably imply the being of him who poses it? Does being exist? What is being? I cannot reflect on these problems without seeing a new chasm open under my feet: I who question being, can I be assured that I am? . . . So long as I confine myself to reflection alone, it seems that I am involved in a state of endless regression. However, by the very reality of this regression I conceive of the impos- sibility of determining an end. I go beyond it, as it were. I am aware that this process is inherent in a manner of affir- mation that I am to a greater extent than I profess: in pro- fessing it I destroy this affirmation, I shatter it, I am prepared to betray it. One could say in unavoidably approximate terms that my interrogation of being presupposes an affirmation in which I would be passive to a certain degree and of which I would be the center rather than the subject. But this is only a boundary that I cannot reach without contradiction. Thus, I am directed toward the position or awareness of a participation that con- sists of a reality of subject. This participation cannot, by defi- nition, be the object of thought. It cannot serve as the solu- tion, but goes beyond the world of problems: it is meta- problematic.12 This celebrated text, in which certitude is implied in the question itself, formulates what might be called the Marcelian Cogito. By not limiting the scope of an interrogation that questions "the totality of being and of the I in its measure of totality," ontologic assurance embraces 11 Ibid. P. 34. 12 Position et Approches concretes du Myst're ontologique, p. 54-56. 93</page><page sequence="7">Yale French Studies me as the incarnate subject, reveals being as the presence, at the heart of unique existence, of an "illimitable concrete."'3 The identity of the individual and of the transcendent is affirmed in opposition to all doc- trine of being in general. Moreover, being, revealing itself as mystery, denies the possibility of a constatation of presence or absence on which pessimism is founded. The problem confronts me as an obstacle crossing my path, objective in the etymologic sense of the word. Transcending opposition of the "in-me" and the "before-me," the mystery, "problem that encroaches on its own immanent conditions of possibility," evades all objective apprehension because I am inextricably implied in my very liberty: it cannot be proven, but only recognized, in a procedure-that reflective mediation rescues from all arbitrariness, without depriving it of its nature of free consent. In the act in which thought transcends itself, theoretical and practical reason are identified. "Ontologic humility," exem- plifying the words of St. Paul "Ye are not your own," commands all of spiritual life. It might seem that Gabriel Marcel's notion of mystery implies a double meaning: adherence of my body, adhesion to being. Such an interpretation would not acknowledge that, far from being imposed as a limiting necessity, incarnation is itself only recognized through free reflection, baring me, on the other hand, to the cosmic presence that "in affecting me, creates me." In fact, the participation that I cannot transcend discloses and postulates the participation that transcends me. Factual involvement is determined by moral involvement which unites the two meanings of the notion of incarnation: my body incarnates me, I incarnate being. It is through metaphysical betrayal that the participa- tion that constitutes the I unifies its double aspect, degenerates into a multiplicity of insoluble problems. Yet at the heart of all existentially reclaimed human realities, there lies, as the truth of our condition, the ontologic mystery. Thought, knowledge, suffering, hope, love, faith-com- posite experiences of intimacy and transcendence-all unveil, like so many modalities of the same mystery, the immediation of the individual and of the absolute, and make manifest the essential primacy of the that in which and through which I am over the I am. Autonomy is an objectification of liberty. The richer experience becomes, the less the ego perceives itself as a separate entity, sui juris. The creator is distin- guished from the fabricator precisely in his power of reception and receptivity. The logical opposition of inflicting and submitting to, giving and taking back, relative to a consciousness conceived of as an "objet dos," vanishes in the highest realization of ourselves, in which the spirit, 13 Du Reflm u' I'Invocation, p. 91. 94</page><page sequence="8">LOUIS PAMPLUME communing with an inspiring presence, recognizes it as nourished and actually created by the very thing to which it is consecrated. Our freedom is only a power of refusal or allegiance to that which makes us free. The ethics of participation nevertheless excludes all quietism. If the ontologic necessity, reassured that it is not mere nostalgia, discovers that it manifests a "prise de l'etre" (the grasp that being has) on us, this unobjectifiable grasp escapes our own grasp and operates like magnetism or a stimulus. All presence, from that of beings and the world to that of the Divine Presence, is established in the benefaction of its influx as creative stimulus. Upon our "availability" depends our knowing how to perceive a vocation in our condition, our knowing how to give meaning to the tragedy of suffering as well as to any ordeal-a meaning that although not objectively inherent in these experiences, does not become manifest to any greater degree as in inert matter but necessitates an involvement, an inner transformation. It is through a creative interpre- tation that we are able to give life the countenance of destiny. At the point of sainthood, our total incarnation would be nothing more than a transparency of being. At the origin of the immanentist position which embraces idealism, Gabriel Marcel discovers the sin of spiritual pride. On another level, sense and nonsense being unverifiable, the "absurdisme" of atheist existen- tialism discloses a choice in favor of the absurd. A philosophy based on the denial of participation can be formulated in intellectual asceticism oriented toward the unconditionality of pure mind. In the case of atheist existentialism, such a philosophy proposes a doctrine of involvement but accepts incarnation only by degrading it to factitiousness. In these two attitudes existence, emptied of its "ontologic weight," only escapes from despair through recourse to stoic illusionism. The theoretic category of objectivity, in a domain that is the very negation of ethics, corresponds with the practical category of Having. For, far from being the occasion of a moral affirmation of autonomy, the space hollowed out between subject and object by "spectacular detachment" is filled by an avidity for possession that appears as the perverted "ersatz" of ontologic neces- sity. The more we identify ourselves with our possessions, the less we are. Claiming to enslave the object, man enslaves himself with the worry and anguish of which all having becomes the source: "L'inventoriable est le lieu du desespoir."14 We can only regain our being beyond our having by mastering our mastery. At the threshold of spiritual life reflec- tion discloses the intelligible structure of a truth in which conversion is born and metaphysically creates mysticism. We cannot arrive at the 14Etre et Avoir, p. 148. 95</page><page sequence="9">Yale French Studies "illimitable concrete" except with that which is "most untainted, most pure in us." Only the casting-off of all opulence and pride will restore to us a contemplative innocence, "a power of wonder" comparable to the evangelical spirit of childhood. This purity, however, nourishes an active fervor. "Becoming a subject is neither a fact nor a starting point, but an achievement and a goal.""5 The ontologic mystery is revealed to creative fidelity as the experienced dialectic of grace and freedom. The metaphysics of mystery refutes all ontologic explanation-rational explanation which reduces presence to a concept, or gnostic explanation which is founded on the privilege of intuition conceived of as a separate experience. Marcelian doctrine refutes agnosticism no less radically than the foregoing. We know being insofar as we participate in it. The assimilation of knowledge into understanding promotes the idea of exercized intelligibility. All light radiates from being. We are as though in the presence of a brilliance whose source remains invisible because it is situated at the very origin of our vision. All that we receive is the radiation in a "reflective intuition," a "blinded intuition ' "that cannot actually be for itself but can only perceive itself through the modes of experience on which it is reflected and which it illumines by this same reflection."I7 These modes of experience indicate the aspects that are assumed by creative fidelity-the substance of spiritual life-according to the domains in which it operates. Existential ontology manifests itself in a phenomenology of ontologic experiences. Beyond all ethical formal- ism-from the nostalgia of being to the summit of sainthood-existence, in an ascending dialectic, bears simultaneously upon both reality and the being that apprehends it, shapes itself into as many levels of profun- dity as correspond with levels of truth. Verifiability is only applicable at its lowest level. The more pregnant a truth is with significance, the less it can be detached from the being that incarnates it. Poets, prophets and saints are witnesses to a truth they do not prove but to which they attest. However, on this level the absence of an objective criterion in no way entails a subjectivism in which only the intensity of adhesion would decide its authenticity. The ecstasy of martyrdom may well disguise a pathologic form of self-affirmation. Being is only attained by surpassing the separate self. All consecration that does not partake of the spirit of justice and love, in which the act of transcendence is postulated as the unique realiza- tion of a universality de jure, becomes idolatry. There is no "human nature." In attempting to take hold objectively of our reality, we find ourselves in the presence of an "existential vacil- 15 Du Ref us a l'Invocation, p. 236. 16Etre et Avoiw, p. 175. 7 Ibid., p. 170. 96</page><page sequence="10">LOUIS PAMPLUME lation." Man determines his being, or rather determines to be or not to be, according to "whether he affirms being and opens himself to it, or whether he denies it and at the same time shuts himself off."118 But this fundamental choice is not effectuated in confusion and ignorance. Fol- lowing its own vocation, metaphysical reflection becomes redeeming in the measure in which, orienting itself toward an epistemology of love, it delimits a "logic of liberty." "It is private life that holds out the mirror to infinity; personal inter- course, and that alone, that ever hints at a personality beyond our daily vision." Gabriel Marcel twice, in the course of his work, quotes these words of the novelist E. M. Forster in which the central idea of his philosophy is expressed: the unity of meaning of the two dimensions of transcendence and intimacy. The incarnate being is immediately apparent to others as well as to the world-esse est co-esse. The Other One, objectively apprehended as identical with his vital statistics, absent even when physically near, is defined as Him. He becomes authentically You in the plenitude of love. Marcelian spirituality excludes the romantic dream of fusion in sameness: we are one with the other, the living unity of us is as opposed to the inherent conformity as it is to the exterior conformity. While object and judgment, relating to a dialogue that deals with them, are of triadic essence, as shown by Josiah Royce, love achieves a dyad whose true mode of expression is Invocation-"The You is to Invocation what the object is to judgment."'9 Invocation brings to a transcendent infinite all possible characterization and all reason. I love you not because you are such or so, but because you are you. In Invocation it is not a feeling that is expressed but rather a person, who is identified not with the love he experiences but with the love he is. All so-called psychology of love is thus contradictory in its very project. There is only one way of defining love and that is to love. TIhe unity of the We is affirmed as metaphysically primary over the I. The dualism of the "I-He," born of the rupturing of the dyad "I-You," is relative to the aseity (by-one's-self-ness) in which I enclose myself. Autocentrism inevitably objectifes me and exiles me from myself. In love, as the result of an inner reconciliation in which I find my concrete unity and become You for myself, the presence of another mediatizes my own presence. In the discovery of the ontologic meaning of incarna- tion begins a spirituality at the end of which love confers upon presence its total plenitude-"a mystery such as that of body and soul is only tangible through love and in a certain way expresses it."20 Conferring an 18Ibid., p. 175. 19 Journal metaphysique, p. 277. 20 Position et Approches concretes dtu Mystere ontologique, p. 59. 97</page><page sequence="11">Yale French Studies absolute value on the humblest aspects of existence, love becomes the very act of redemption. All experience of being is experience of love, not only through the generosity it requires but through' the transforma- tion it effectuates, when all distinction vanishes between the flesh that is spiritualized and the spirit that is incarnated. "The sphere !of the meta-problematic coincides with the sphere of love.'"21 Only love, as E. M. Forster asserts, orients us toward the absolute love that is faith. "As strange as this may seem to sheer reason, there can exist a love without conditions of man for man .. ." Upon question- ing "the underlying connection that unites pure Faith in its ontologic plenitude to this unconditional love of man for man," Gabriel Marcel affirms his conviction that such a love "is only thinkable, is only possible in a being capable of this faith, but in whom it is not yet awakened; it is perhaps like prenatal palpitation." 22 It may seem paradoxical that by the end of an introduction to Christian existentialism we have but very briefly presented the theory of faith. In exposing a doctrine that in all its processes is guided by faith as a veiled presence, we have never, in a sense, spoken of anything else. In opposi- tion to any idea of understanding, conviction or hypothesis, faith, accord- ing to Gabriel Marcel, appears as the supreme expression of ontologic ad- herence, absolute love and creative fidelity in its highest form. God is the name that being receives at the summit of ascending dialectics, the Absolute You toward whom the Invocation of prayer rises. "Ontologic humility" itself implies philosophic faith whose transformation into truly religious faith can be mediatized by no dialectic, but only by grace, which transcends all philosophy. Gabriel Marcel's entire doctrine, through its restoration of an authentic idea of truth, the elucidation of the ontologic mystery and the phenomenology of its modes, assumes the apologetic value of an appeal. To return to the dialectics of being on a religious level, where ontol- ogic necessity turns to an "Absolute Recourse," reflection proves that a God whose existence could be verified-by empiric observation or by rational conclusiveness of demonstration-would lose his character of Transcending Being. The critique of faith conceived of as an affirmation without proof thus loses its very object, at the same time that a rational theology postulated in understanding is determined inadmissible. In its opposition to rationalism, however, fideism admits itself subject to the same objective conception of truth: faith only plays the role of a sub- 21Ibid., p. 59. 22 Du Refus a' lInvocation, p. 179. 98</page><page sequence="12">LOUIS PAMPLUME jective compensation for the despair of ever attaining absolute understand- ing. According to the dictum of the German philosopher Peter Wust, the fideist is only a "disillusioned gnostic." Turning radically away from the notion of an ideal object, the appeal for the "Unverifiable Absolute" transcends by this very act its subjective aspect. Becoming aware of its unconditional meaning, it surpasses itself as an appeal, "changes direc- tion," and manifests "something more inherent in me than myself." Our appeal for God is participation based on an intimate presence, whose immediate character recalls, in relation to all discursive conclusions, that of sensation. The soul maintains itself available to Divine Presence only through love. "I cease believing in God from the moment that I cease loving him."23 A "psychology of religious life" that destroys faith in its aspect of dyadic union is doomed to miss its true essence. Similarly, any theology that defines God as the primal cause, the cosmologic prin- ciple, and is formulated in a logic of being, transforms the Absolute You into Him and only treats of an idol. "When we speak of God," states Gabriel Marcel in a celebrated line, "we must fully realize that it is not of God we are speaking."24 What opposes the scholastic tradition is not a purely negative theology, but rather a "theology of concrete approaches." The ontology of being in itself makes way for an "ontology of sainthood." To believe is not to believe that, but to believe in. We do not "possess" faith; faith infinitely surpasses the awareness that we can have of it because it constitutes our very being. Its ontologic plenitude is indivisi- bly existential plenitude. "An intellectualism that pretends that I can only elevate myself to faith by extricating myself, even ideally, from my sen- sitive nature, seems to me doomed to losing the essential of that very thing which it attempts to apprehend in its purity."25 God does not separate but unites. The love of beings, the love of the world find in the love of God both their supreme realization and their ultimate founda- tion. Far from causing a withdrawal from reality, sainthood, the total consecration of existence to being, radiates from an intensity of presence that is experienced reality. In concluding, we shall limit ourselves to a few comments on the meaning of Marcelian existentialism. It would be a denial of its very spirit to see in it an emotional in- tuitionism or a mystical empiricism. No rights are accorded sentiment as such. The concern for the most rigorous truth leads reflection, beyond the mutual blindness of psychologic affectivity and abstract understanding, to find in the reciprocity of light and love the true unity of the spirit. 23 Journal metaphysique, p. 58. 24 Ibid., p. 158. 25 Da Refus a l'Invocation, p. 219. 99</page><page sequence="13">Yale French Studies Love conceived of not as an accidental sentiment but as the original Eros spurs the intelligence to the encounter of a light toward which one should turn, according to the Platonic expression, with one's entire soul. This light is doubtless possible only through a sort of "'fecund irradia- tion" of Revelation, whose philosophy remains nevertheless intrinsically independent. The idea of the historicity of the Absolute, replacing the most naive anthropomorphism, cannot be philosophically integrated with rationalism except through a symbolic interpretation that would ruin it in its essence of revelation. Also opposed to rationalism is the "credo quia absurdum" of the Kierkegaardian Paradox. But an existentialism founded on the intimate connection of incarnation and transcendence opens a third road, where Revelation, without losing any of its super- natural character, becomes in a way metaphysically plausible. Philosophic mysteries foreshadow and anticipate the mysteries of faith and constitute the introduction of the supernatural into the very heart of nature. The flesh and the spirit partake of the same redemption. Coming after a Claudel, and above all a Peguy, Marcelian spirituality, rediscovering Christian authenticity beyond Jansenist perversion, is guided toward the recapitulation of all things in God. Even the perceivable is sacred; the universe in its totality conceals a liturgic meaning, a sacramental value. For those who would refuse to follow it in its ultimate steps, Gabriel Marcel's thought still retains its truly religious value which, outside of any Christian frame of reference, he himself recognizes in the Rilkian orphism: "Aber noch ist uns das Dasein verzaubert" (existence is for us still bewitched). Spiritual realism, orienting transcendence less in the sense of the beyond than of the profundity, excludes as treasonable the nostalgia of an ideal "arriere monde" more or less objectively conceived; but, disclosing an "ontologic trauma" in any doctrine that embraces experience within itself, spiritual realism reveals "the existence of a sort of metaphysical Atlantis . . ."26 Regnum Dei intra vos est.
