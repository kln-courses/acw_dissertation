<plain_text><page sequence="1">Painted Cave by Steven R. Cooper, Editor-in-Chief Awhile back I was visiting the Southern California area. On a trip up the coast, I was told a special treat was in store for me. Out- side of Santa Barbara, we drove up a steep mountain road for fifteen minutes and came to a sign announcing Painted Cave State Park. I have seen cave art before. I've visited several caves in the Tennessee/Kentucky area, including Dunbar Cave in Clarksville. All had some evidence of Mississippian art. Most drawings were barely visible. I had also visited a Chumash (pronounced "shoe-mash") Indian cave right outside of Los Angeles, and every- one was excited about the two highly eroded red figures on the back cave wall. They were very difficult to make out and looked like just doodles created with some red ocre by prehis- toric man. We parked and walked up the road to the cave. Obviously, from my previous experi- ences I didn't expect much. We climbed up the path to the entrance, which was blocked by an iron gate. Behind it was a massive wall covered with huge paintings. The paint was still bright and colorful, as if had been created yesterday. Some drawings had been damaged by modern graffiti, but the artwork was still intact. I was allowed to stay awhile to view and photograph the images. I was struck by the similarity to Mississippian cave art. What drove the Chumash and the Mississippians to create these images? The Mississippian cave art has been mostly hidden until modern times. However, the Chumash were still living in primitive conditions as late as 1800. Span- ish missionaries observed the creation of two cave paintings and wrote about them. They said local shamans created the paintings, and that Indians said they represented the spirits of the shamans for all to see. Oral traditions collected at the turn of the century by several ethnographers confirmed the shamanistic origin of the images and shed some light on their usage and meaning. It seems the Chumash believed the cosmos con- sisted of powerful supernatural forces. The story is that the Sun and Sky Coyote played a gambling game each night. If the Sky Coy- ote won this game, the harvest for the next year would be good. If the Sun won, he would win human lives. The shamans kept a tally of the game, hoping to foresee coming events. The entrance to Painted Cave 42</page><page sequence="2">One of the larger group images to be seen at Painted Cave. Note the large anthropomorphic being on the left that is portrayed in white and black colors. There are some who believe parts of this image represent a depic- tion of a solar eclipse that occurred on November 24, 1677. From tests, it is known that some of the drawings are thousands of years old. This is a huge wall, probably 30 feet by 30 feet. Many symbols also utilized by the Mississippians can be seen, including the cross, scalloped circles and sun symbols. 43 Much like the Mississippian drawings, many show anthropomorphic beings. Humans have antlers and are shown turning into birds. Many have their hands raised with palms open. They also have many circular motifs, probably indicating heavenly bodies such as the sun and moon or stars. I've learned since that Painted Cave is just one of a few Chumash caves in California open to public viewing. Most are in out of the way places, and since their art is very fragile they are protected and viewing is not allowed. Obviously ancient man wondered the same thoughts we have today. Maybe there is some- thing to learn from these ancient complex drawings beyond just admiring them. I think it's the fact that we have much in common with these ancient peoples. Maybe our under- standing of the cosmos is more scientific. Yes, our ability of communicate is far beyond the imaginings of ancient man. We may not write on rock walls to share or save our thoughts, but the questions are all the same. Who are we? What does the future hold? Why do we die? Is there any reason or order to this chaos of life?

William Smith drained a swampy area that had been underwater in the late 1960s. He first plowed the area in 1968, and started to uncover the large blades. When first spotted from his tractor, he thought they were turtles. He went down to pick them up and found six of the largest blades. From 1968 to 1972 more than 200 were found. They still show up, sev- eral being found in the late 1990s. No other artifacts of any type have been found in the drained swamp area. Of the blades found, five were over seven inches in length and two nearly reached eight inches. One blade was longer than eight inches. The blade pictured is almost 7 Vi inches long, 3 Vi inches in width, and as seen in the side view, just lA inch in thickness at the center of the blade.

These magnificent creations are nearly identical in size and manufacture, leading one to believe that perhaps the same individual made them. They are made from two exotic materials, Williamsite and Bowenite, and are both translucent. Each measures approximately 2 Vi inches long by 2 inches wide. Both are polished smooth and have an amazing perfection of form. Collection of Rickey P.

It is an extraordinarily well-proportioned, polished specimen, made of dark brown fine-grained hardstone. It is 3 % inches long by 2-3/8 inches high, and exhibits no signs of damage or utilitarian usage on either the poll or bit surfaces. The exact purpose of use of miniature axes like this is unknown. Collection of Ron Harris, Hickory ; North Carolina This well-defined Southern Barbed Axe was found in the north-central Piedmont region of North Carolina in Stokes County. It is made of dark brown fine-grained hardstone and is an excellent example of the rare 4/4 Southern raised-ridge style axe with pronounced side barbs. Very few axes of this type and quality have been found in the Blue Ridge Mountain foothills of the Carolinas or Virginia. This 7 Vi inches long specimen exhibits wear polish on the bit edge which suggests it was used for utilitarian cutting or chopping tasks. There is minimal battering on the squared poll end which suggests moderate hammering or pounding usage.

It features fine flaking, serrations around the edges and unusual spotting in the colorful material. Randy Nichols found this blade in Livingston County, Kentucky in March 2008.
