<plain_text><page sequence="1">RHETORIC FOR THE SENSES: A CONSIDERATION OF MUSLIM PARADISE NARRATIVES* That sensual pleasure in this world is praised and, indeed, enjoined in Muslim tradition when it occurs within the bounds of legitimate union, requires no demonstration. Equally demonstrable is the discouragement of serious forms of long-term asceticism and of carnal self-denial, over and above what some sufis might adopt during periods of initiation and devotional isolation (khalwa). The repudiation of pleasure characteristic of Christian traditions in general1 is almost entirely absent, and monastic life with its various forms of physical self-immolation was frequently the object of derision by Muslim authors, who often regarded it as something contrary to what God intended for, and by, nature. Islamic traditions thus appear to take cognizance of desire, and this recognition permeates the lines of interpretation and the uses made of Muslim Traditions in legal works, or in works of anecdotal literature, or in sententious works on piety. The pursuit of pleasure, including the supreme pleasure of the flesh, is regarded as in keeping with nature and is indeed enjoined, on account of its accord with nature, by Koranic verses and by Prophetic statements and examples.2 Love (hawd, lishq) is a natural, albeit a pathological humoural condition (melancholy) which burns blood and transforms it to atrabile, causing an inflammation of the gall bladder.3 Its only truly effective remedy is consummation,4 although various forms of sublimation are often suggested. Moreover, sexual pleasure preserves the species and in this capacity is a manifestation of divine grace.5 And whereas libertinism is always proscribed, pietistic texts, by Ghazll (d. 1111) and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (d. 1350) for instance, constantly repeat the contention that sexual pleasure in this * An earlier version of this essay was presented to a symposium at the International Institute for Advanced Studies, Kyoto, in March 1993.

This accounts for recent, unsuccessful, attempts by al-Azhar to suppress a book by the Islamist author Muham- mad JalUl Kishk, in which the fully bisexual promise of Paradise is clearly outlined, and even the attempt by Muhammad Rashid Ridla to interpret the paradisical Huris as indicating no more than a man's earthly wives,7 which matter, we will see, is contrary to both letter and spirit of Muslim traditions. Legal works (fiqh) detail aspects of sexuality in clinical form, in chapters concerning ritual purity (.tahdra) and conjugal relations. Erotic literature abounded which treated sexuality from medical, legal, and lex- ical and "technical" aspects, as well as the anecdotal and the por- nographic. This very rich repertory of anecdotes had a particular social setting, it being in the public domain in female, male and mixed com- pany, although feminine participation in the latter, in this regard, was largely confined to slave girls, a public domain from which family members were excluded.8 Anecdotes involving purely feminine com- pany, which abound in this literature, however, relate both to free women and slave girls. It is not surprising that one lexicographer com- piled a dictionary of sexual terms in which 1083 verbal forms of coitus were listed, and the chapter concerning women in the famous Mukhasas of Ibn Sayyiduh (d. 1067) comprises 289 terms for metonymically describing women by their sexual and temperamental aspect.9 A letter is 6 Al-Ghazali, Al-Mahabba wa'l-uns wa'l-shawq wa'r-ri4d, Cairo, 1961, 52 and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, Rawda, 18-20, 132-133. 7 Muhammad Rashid Rida, Fattiw, ed.

Enjoyment of such beauty and of such pleasure as are tabulated and classified is residual in relation to possession of the capacity to behold and conceive the image of such beauty and pleasure. In other words, the desire is desire for a narcissist spectacle, a voyeurism of one's double. The carnality of Paradise, therefore, is in no wise anomalous or peculiar, although it has presented a problem for many Western writers, occasioning a centuries-long polemic or at the very least the sanc- timonious attitude of some scholars." In medieval Muslim culture, it remained "la doctrine de la masse des fideles a toutes les epoques". 12 Even the strongly anti-anthropomorphic exegesis of the Muctazilite school of theology left the sensuality of these traditions beyond the remit of allegory or of metaphor,13 although an allegorizing pantheistic tendency is detectable in some mystical exegesis.14 Yet it must be stressed that the sensuality of Paradise in Muslim tradi- tion is by no means entirely carnal, for the pleasures of Paradise are polymorphous and engage all the senses,'5 although genital carnality is a pronounced element. Overall, the textual volume occupied by genital desire in the repertoire of Muslim traditions on paradise does not justify exaggeration, although the prurient curiosity of countless generations of Muslims and of Europeans has rendered to it a centrality which is not 10 Text in Ihsin CAbbas, 'Abd al-Hamid b.

Genital desire is one of many delights, but an integral part of the catalogue of the ultimate delights which is paradise according to Muslim tradition. Like other delights-of the palate, of redolence, of posture, of the ear, delightful colours and shapes-carnal delights are described according to a canon which imagines the unimaginable, delights in beholding it, and glories in the possibility of possessing it and of endlessly repeating its possession and enjoyment, which is endless, because the desire is endless. As we shall see, matters heavenly are all described according to an economy of sumptuosity whose measure is infinite. The body of traditions on Paradise is rather small, and seems to have crystallized by the ninth century. It comprises a number of distinct topics-paradisical geography and toponymy, soil and vegetation, architecture; the condition of blessedness, including carnal pleasures and the sumptuosity of victuals and provisions; and ceremonial, including the Beatific Vision. Each is described by a number of distinct Traditions (.hadith) of sparse and rather crude narrative construction, which are of wide incidence and which seldom diverge; they are perhaps most systematically put together in the consolidated treatise Al-Durar al-hisdn by al-Suyiti (d. 1506), which relates them after narratives of Muslim necrology, eschatology, apocalypse, and Hell, with which they are nor- mally associated. The precise history of this limited repertoire of paradisical narratives has not as yet been the topic of any studies known to the present author, and the material is used in the following pages in the original form in which it occurs in traditionalist discourses, as discrete narratives, and it is indeed as discrete narratives or points of detail that this material is used in compilations of Tradition (hadith) and in Koranic exegesis, the two textual locations to which it originally belongs. It is moreover their being discrete narratives that renders them apposite for traditionalist discourses, which, by their very nature, weave this material within their textures in such a way as to make that texture appear as if it were exclusively begotten by this body of canonical material. It is out of such discursive textures that connected narratives of Heaven (as of Hell) are made. The paragraphs to follow have the limited aim of making visible from narrative Traditions of paradisical libidinousness a general physiognomy of this textual material. This puts forth what is essentially a textualization of the imagination, a textualization which renders pleasure rhetorical and constitutes a rhetoric of pleasure, and sets forth a reduction of pleasure and of virtue, as one might witness in an utopian text, to sets of represen- tative figures of pleasure and of virtue. In all, one witnesses a description of Paradise, as of utopia, as if one were inspecting it under the guise of 218</page><page sequence="5">RHETORIC FOR THE SENSES an Intourist guide, as Northrop Frye aptly remarked.'6 Overall, we have before us material amenable to analysis such as a celebrated one under- taken of the social, pornographic, and homiletic utopias of Fourier, Sade, and Loyola, from which resulted the disengagement of Sadean por- nography as being not so much a discourse sustained on amorous acts, but the "tissue of erotic figures, cut up and combined like rhetorical figures of the written discourse"."7 Formal parallels with science fiction, thrillers, and folktales will be readily accessible. There are, of course, many other ways of handling this textual mate- rial with which the present essay will not be concerned. The following pages will not address the various possible aesthetics of reception of these narratives: their insertion in social and temporal instances of pietistic practice and belief, in preachers' art, their relative weight and location in the imaginary life of various times, places, and socio-cultural loca- tions, their relation to non-canonical materials. Nor is there an attempt to study the related issue of the metaphorical use of Paradise to articulate mundane matters: Sufi-inspired notions, for instance, have the four first caliphs (Abui Bakr, CUmar, CUthman, and (All) preexisting in it as lights coeval with the Muhammadan light;18 mysogyny and asceticist piety have the population of Hell predominantly composed of women and of the rich; eighty of the 120 throngs of the Elect housed in Paradise are Muslims; the extent of indulgence in any pleasure in the afterlife is inversely proportional to the extent of indulgence in this world.19 But these matters are outside the remit of this study, as are the ironical and irreverent pronouncements on the descriptions of Paradise as, for instance, those of Ibn al-Rawandi (d. ca. 860), who likened the pleasures described within it to what might be sought by uncouth peasants and Kurdish tribeswomen; so also are the moralistic strictures inspired by philosophical ethics such as the view held by Miskawayh (d. 1030), that the sensual view of Paradise is one held by ignorant degenerates and uncouth commoners, and can lead only to the debasement of this-worldly motivation.20 Nor is there any consequential attempt to do a study of the literary genres in which paradisical narratives are inserted. I have not doen a structural study of these narratives as myths, nor have I analyzed 16 Northrop Frye, "Varieties of Literary Utopia" in F.E.

The reader will not find facile explanations linking those imaginings to the desires of impotent men liv- ing in desert surroundings, neither is there any attempt to use the mate- rial to discuss the constructions of gender. What this study will offer, however, is indications concerning the morphology of the sensual elements in these narratives which might be utilized for further, historical, anthropological, mythological or psychoanalytic studies. The vexed question of provenance and history of these narratives is entirely excluded from consideration, as is that of their subsequent history in late medieval Latin and early European vernacular literatures. Paradise is a realm of accentuation, and the discourse upon it a logothesis of rhetorical figures whose very improbability appears to be the measure of their desirability and, indeed, of their very inevitability. One prophetic tradition states that, just as Hell is all the more hellish for being surrounded by desires and pleasures, so Paradise is surrounded by unpleasantness.21 Many traditions describe the awareness of the Blessed of the fate of the Damned, and one articulates pleasure and pain and accentuates both by stating that the delightful Huris enjoyed by the Blessed are in fact the wives of men who dwell in Hell,22 although other traditions describe the Blessed as being in total oblivion to all but the pleasures to which they attend constantly23-each group of traditions is of use in particular discursive contexts. But all in all, Paradise is the realm of pleasure so accentuated as to be perpetual and consummate-so much so, indeed, that it is said that the Blessed do not sleep, for fear slumber may divert them from their pleasurable occupations.24 Desires in this realm of perpetual consummation are only virtual, as they are eradicated with such an immediacy and perpetuity of fulfilment as is the very stuff of Paradise. A hyperbolic rhetoric of pleasure, articulated in figures and classes of pleasurable acts and pleasurable objects, constitute a discourse closed by its very narration in the figures and topoi whose sentences are the sole reality of these sentences. The juxtaposition in the Koranic text of the delights of Paradise and the torments of Hell are constant.25 The same can be said for other rele- 21 Muslim, Al-Jdmic al-$a.hh, Cairo, A.H. 1383, vol. 8, 142-3. 22 Ibn Maja, Sunan, ed.

In all respects, the discourses on Heaven and on Hell are isornorphous, and complementary within their broader, discursive and other instances. Like all discourse on Paradise, descriptions of Hell are a labour of accentuation, of rendering impeccable and consummate, for just as the pleasures of Paradise are impeccable and ever consummate, so are the torments to be met with in the dark catacombs of Hell, which signal the consummatenes of their opposite: if one drop of zaqqlim, a juice extracted from a hellish tree on which the Damned feed, were to pollute the oceans, it would entirely spoil earthlings' livelihood, and if one single spark from the fire of Hell were to reach the East, its heat would be felt in the West, and if a mountain were to be struck by a club with which the Damned are beaten, this mountain would be sure to disintegrate.26 A Sisyphean mountain is located in Hell, which the Damned are forced to climb; it is a mountain made of fire so intense, that whenever the climber's hand is placed on it, it melts, and grows again instantly once it is withdrawn, and so that whenever the climber's foot is placed on it, this also melts, to be instantly replaced once it is withdrawn.27 Thus it is clear that the discourse on Heaven (like that of Hell) is struc- tured by two principles which constitute its elements: pleasure which is never inconsummate and always fulfilled, and the expression of this pleasure in terms of scale-the counterparts of this in Hell are of course the perpetuity and intensity of torment. It is noteworthy that this is out of keeping with the normal discourse on the exoticist fantastic in medieval Arab-Islamic culture. For there, the fantastic is expressed not in terms of distortion of size, but of grotesque hybridization and per- mutation of parts or by morphological distortion.28 But it is comparable to two types of Arab fantastic narrative, which share some of its fantastic realism whereby fantasy is engendered by distortions of scale: eschatological narratives, especially of the Gog and Magog, and the fan- tastic sumptuosity of the Thousand and One Nights and of anecdotal and pseudo-historical repertoires, especially those concerning the remote past; both also involve hybridization and the grotesque. Overall the material is narrative, with its veracity and realism strongly implied by its discursive context. But the mechanisms of realizing imaginary possibilities are distinct. Be that as it may, the imaginative desire of the Blessed is limitless. Whatever one wishes is instantly materialized, so that desire is always matched by its consummation and is never merely desire.29 The 26 Ibn Kathir, Nihdya, vol. 2, 129, 145, 152. 27 Ibid., 158. 28 See Aziz Al-Azmeh, Al-CArab wa'l-Barabira, London, 1991, 197 ff. 29 Muslim, $ahi.h, vol. 1, 114. 221</page><page sequence="8">RHETORIC FOR THE SENSES limitlessness of fulfillment is also implicated in the fairly rare Tradition that the Blessed can, at a particular place in Paradise, be metamorphosed into the identical copy of whoever they might wish to resemble.30 On entry into Paradise, the Blessed are asked if they would be content with having what earthly kings have, and when they answer in the affirmative, they are given ten times as much,3' and even the lowliest among their number possesses 80,000 servants, 72 consorts, and a pavilion made of pearls and rubies whose size is as the distance between $an'c in Yemen and southern Syria,32 although it is sometimes said that this pavilion is merely a cavernous giant pearl measuring one parsang by one parsang, with 4000 golden doors, or, in other traditions, measuring three nights' march across.33 It is unsurprising that the soil of Paradise should be of musk, that its breeze should be scented with musk, that its rivers are of pure water, milk, honey, and wine, that its dimensions should be so vast. The sense of space is also conveyed by the trees that exist therein, which shade areas 100 years' march across and which, once a fruit is picked off them, immediately give birth to another34--not only is desire immediately arrested by fulfillment, but visual want and the potential for privation are instantly remedied by the restoration of impeccability, of consum- mateness, of the integral spectacle which might again call up desire. This expansion of spatial dimensions and the instant remedialism of paradisical physiology is matched by the contraction of temporal dimen- sions, conveying a sense of constant immediacy, of a timeless because effortless eternity, an eternity reduced to the dimension of an instant. Thus the same vast trees mentioned, whose fragrance can be smelt up to 1000 years' journey away, can nevertheless be crossed in the flash of an eyelid if one were seated on the Rafraf, the winged horse made of red rubies which, along with a white camel, are, apart from birds, the only animals in Paradise.35 And when a man from among the Blessed reclines in repose, he does so for seventy years at a stretch,36 a span of time which indicates the immediate timelessness conveyed by repose. As for the plenty of clothing-all silk-the same garment worn by one of the blessed 30 Al-Tirmidhi, Sunan, ed.

It is in keeping with this fundamental nature of things paradisical that every man in Paradise be optimally conceived: he will have the height of Adam (60 cubits), the age of Jesus (33 years), the beauty ofJoseph, and he will have Muhammad's language,38 for each of these descriptions is in itself consummate: Adam is the consummation of innocent original humanity recapitulated in Paradise, the age of Jesus is that of consummate yet still vigorous manhood, Joseph was prover- bially beautiful and the Arabic language is that of the Koran which rounds off human existence and consummates it, and clearly, of Paradise and of God Himself. The spectacular impeccability of the heavenly throngs is further emphasized by the absence of ordures, for the Blessed do not blow their noses, nor do they urinate or defecate and are indeed said not to have recta, and the women do not menstruate. In the rare event of spitting, such spittle is so sweet as to sweeten the sea, and any bodily waste is released by the skin in the form of a musk-like scent-the bodies of the Blessed, after all, are perfected and eternal, and what they consume is consumed for pleasure only, not for sustenance, and the sumptuosity of provisions is again for pleasure and entirely unrelated to need.39 A not unnatural implication of this is that, the copious intensity of sex- ual activity notwithstanding, no semen is produced by either man or woman-medieval physiology believed both sexes produced their respec- tive types of semen, both required for conception. Sexual union is con- ducted as a continuous movement of shoving (dahman dahman), uninterrupted by orgasm,0° therefore unspoilt and potentially a perpetual act. The sexual capacity of every man in Paradise is the equal to that of one hundred men of the world, capable of deflowering and copulating with one hundred virgins every day,41 an optimal potency which is a con- summate maximum like the impeccable expression in terms of prophets that was encountered above-indeed, Solomon was credited with the libido of one hundred men while Muhammad, manifestly well provided, only had that of thirty to forty men.42 37 Al-$andni, Al-Muzannaf, ed.

It indicates certainly more than the sublimation of an impotent or geriatric libidinousness. For one thing, it conforms to one fundamental narrative disposition which requires a sense of the perpetuity of pleasure, and it is interesting that the finality of climax was not thus conceived sub specie aeternitatis, but was rather subsumed in the moment of perpetual potency, of endless capacity, of the total and unbending empowerment expressed in the endless frenetism of the expression dahman dahman, thus underlining the rhetoric of spectacle according to which Paradise is constructed. More- over, it conflates beginnings with ends, climax with coitus, and thus eradicates desire as desire by rendering the fulfillment of desire coeval with desire itself and by freezing activity in a moment-eternity where desire as longing and inconsummate wish, that is, as privation, is eradicated and transformed into desire as a mere figure of utter fulfill- ment: in this, desire in Paradise ceases to be desire, and is transformed into wish, into the imagination of desire instantly eradicated, and frozen into the image of fulfillment which is the paradisical reality of a desire which is only virtual. Thus, just as space is inconsequential and is the mere indication of spatial sumptuosity, and just as time is nonexistent, as it never intervenes between beginnings and ends but only passes in a space shorter than the flash of an eyelid, so is coital activity frozen in an eternal moment of potency, in the form of a spectacle. In other words, sexual pleasure-or rather, genital possession-is a visual prospectus for pleasure delightful to desire, not an act involving desire or pleasure; and just as the physical description of Paradise is a prospectus for boundless sumptuosity which, upon scrutiny, will reveal itself to be in part a situation of extreme discomfort and coldness-hard surfaces of precious stones-so genital congress with the famous huris (al- huir al-cn--those with large jet black eyes) will reveal itself as pleasing to the imagination only if the various single components of these acts are each considered on its own and as an instance of sumptuosity magnified, and if the appearance of these huris is itself disassociated into the compo- nent parts of which the huris are composed. The rhetoric of paradisical pleasure, like the rhetoric of canonical feminine beauty, is the congress and concatenation of single pleasurable parts. More on this later. Of paradisical consorts, it is a matter of general Consensus (ijmdc), (with variations irrelevant for the purposes of this study) that every man in Paradise will have two wives-women who had lived and died, nor- mally the man's earthly wives-in addition to seventy huris.43 Additional 43 For instance, Muslim, Sahth, vol. 1, 120 and Ibn Kathir, Nihaya, vol. 2, 258-9. 224</page><page sequence="11">RHETORIC FOR THE SENSES pleasure is derived from the enjoyment of boys,4+ although some exegetes do not seem to imply any carnality in this enjoyment but rather convey a sense of these boys figuring as assiduous servants, while others explicitly denied the existence of paederasty in Paradise, which induced the infamous but celebrated bisexual libertine poet Abfi Nuwas (d. 813- 815) to urge his friends to stock up in this world on the paederasty that they will miss in Paradise.45 The sense of spectacular unreality is sustained by the character of the sexual relations that exist in Paradise and by the very description of the huris' consummate and fully describable beauty. They are recursively virginal, in keeping with the spectacular consummateness of paradisical physiology, their virginity restored after every defloration by their man who, by all accounts, has a perpetual-and consequently an infinite- erection.46 All the while, the huris pronounce a song announcing their fidelity to their men, their reliability, their constant acquiescence, all of which qualities being, like all else in Paradise, eternally complete and consummate, and an inversion of the character of worldly women.47 One interpretation of a Koranic verse referring to boys in Paradise describes them as true and fast in their attachment, in clear contrast to the rent- boys of Baghdad, notorious for their fickleness, rapacity, and inconstancy.48 Sexual union thus has the quality of spectacle, of a prospectus for perfection, utterly unencumbered, fully consummate. The reduction of the experience of women to the visible and the tactile to the exclusion of other senses well serves their objectification within the realm of the spec- tacular imaginary, and it is precisely this sort of objectification which renders irrelevant Traditions and pietistic writings-relevant to this world-enjoining mutuality in sexual pleasure.49 Pleasure derived from the huris is spectacular, something to be beheld and described, to be enjoyed as the consummate act of the possession 44 For instance, Tabari, Tafsfr, vol. 29, 136 and Tifashi, Nuzhat al-albdb fi-mn Id yuijadfi kitdb, ed.

Hence the almost mathematical and abstract pleasure derived from the idea of pleasure, expressed uniformly and consummately, as one can see in the clinical detachment involved in pornographic discourse describing, for instance, defloration, or a series of sixteen positions of heterosexual and intercourse, each ending with a metonymical title derived from the sound caused by, or from another characteristic of, the position.50 It also bears comparison with the clinical detachment in evidence in the works of Sade-and is therefore Sadean albeit not sadistic-where the actor is also the punctilious spectator, where the act and the conception of the act are one, where the gaze and the technique are coterminous. In addition to this, in the case of paradisical pleasure, it cannot be overstressed that sexual pleasure is entirely and exclusively genital, complementary to the infinite erections of the Blessed. This perpetual cathexis is performed upon objects whose very descrip- tion necessitates their fragmentation into parts which convey the spec- tacle of sumptuosity and consummate beauty, but which, when entire, do not meet any aesthetic specifications of which the present author is aware. This virtual beauty is consonant with the virtual pleasure of genital congress with them. The beauty of the huris is accounted for by their eyes, and by the shape of their breasts (kawdaib), which are the small breasts of pubescent girls in early adolescence, and which conform to the charms of cA)isha which the Prophet so admired.51 In this, the appearance of the huris answers to a bookish medieval Arab-Islamic canon of feminine beauty,52 which is correlative with the spectacular quality required by discourse on Paradise. This canon of beauty, it must be stressed, is one based on the separate descriptions of individual bodily parts, the optimally beautiful ones which, if combined, convey strangely grotesque and improbable shapes, such as the breasts indicated conjoined to a very narrow waist and unnaturally huge buttocks. Such is the man- ner in which a rhetoric of beauty is construed. The discourse on the idea of paradisical pleasure devolves here again to one on the idea of the spectacular sumptuosity of the object, and con- s0 Tifashi, Nuzha, 282-3; Ibn Kamal Pasha, Ruju` al-shaykh, 144-7. 51 Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, Rawda, 197, who misinterprets the word, on which see Tijani, Tuhfa, 318.

For the huris' complexion is so soft and white that their skin, as thin and delicate as the membrane separating an egg from its shell,53 is simultaneously reflective (because white) and translucent (because soft): a man sees his own face reflected in her skin, despite the seventy garments of exquisite finesse that she wears,54 and his sight can also penetrate her skin and flesh to see the marrow inside her bones, as one sees red drink in a white glass.55 Other traditions describe the huris as composite creatures: they are made of musk between their feet and knees, of amber between their knees and breasts, and of camphor upwards of their chest.56 Objects to behold in every discrete detail, enticements that engage the desire for enjoyment and the idea of an infinity of pleasure, the huris yet do not conclude nor foreclose the possibilities of even more sublime pleasure. And this further sublimity is also a spectacle, that of the vision of God's Face which, it has been rightly pointed out, is in continuity with the sexual pleasures of Paradise in which the sexual and the sacral are integrated.57 The agency of this integration, the continuum along which both are ranged, and the sign under which it is performed, is the spec- tacle and the sense of pleasure, of bliss, that it conveys. The involvement of the Scriptures in this is a purely aesthetic one, where the Text is fully aestheticized and sensualized, and converted to pleasure, as we shall see. Scripture is no longer a guide to belief and action: this function, purely mundane, is superseded by its becoming an object of sheer enjoyment. It seems immaterial precisely how the Face of God is seen, how much of it is seen, in what form, or whether it is pure light,58 all of which are matters deeply implicated in theological disputes over anthropomor- phism and allegorism; these matters do not seem to have had a conse- quential impact on the aesthetic of this vision, on its inevitability, or the circulation of images concerning the relevant literature, much of which, by all indications, is somewhat later than the crystallization of had£th nar- ratives on Paradise. It is equally immaterial whether women in Paradise do in fact behold Him,59 though the predominant strand of opinion seems to have been that they do.

He entitles his chapter on Paradise "The Infinite Orgasm" which is inappropriate. 58 For instance, Ghazill, Mahabba, 40-41; Muslim, Sahfh, vol. 1, 112-5; Tabari, Tafsir, vol. 29, 120. 59 Ibn Kathir, Nihdya, vol. 2, 302. 227</page><page sequence="14">RHETORIC FOR THE SENSES to the desired experience of Paradise is that beholding the divine Face is the most pleasurable of all paradisical delights.60 In all events, the Beatific Vision is said to occur at regular intervals, specified by particular days in some traditions and allocated to particular times of the day in others, and, in all cases, following a rhythm roughly equivalent to the mundane rhythm of prayer rituals. Other traditions suppose Him to be beholden as is the moon, by men in repose, reclining on their couches.61 These periodic encounters are nowhere described as to their pro- ceedings. But an idea of what might be involved could be be gained from the descriptions that abound of the spectacular reception God throws for the Blessed upon their arrival in Paradise. For the sumptuosity of this spectacle-presided over by God, who is also the main actor in this spec- tacle and the climax of the "sublime symphony"62 performed-reclaims all the elements that have been discussed in this study, with the exception of the genital, for the pleasure deriving from the Beatific Vision far exceeds pleasure derived from intercourse. The reception63 is preceded by a procession of the Blessed, led by Adam, Muhammad and the other prophets. In the flash of an eyelid, they all traverse the span of a silver castle the length of 1000 years' march, then that of a golden castle of the same dimensions. Also in the flash of an eyelid, the procession traverses the 3000-year span of a castle made of green emerald and a 4000-year castle of red ruby. Just as instantly, the throngs travers a fifth castle, 5000 years long and made of sapphire, and a sixth, 6000 years long and made of chrysolite, and four further castles of various precious stones and up to 10,000 years long. After all these distances have been covered, the procession glimpses, at a distance of 10,000 years, the lights of the divine enclave which, when reached, proves to be a green meadow 1000 years by 1000 years, with innumerable castles, each with the name of one of the Blessed inscribed on its door. They then proceed to an even larger meadow, with two rows of trees, each tree bearing 70,000 castles; within each castle are 70,000 couches of gold, each 300 yards long. Should any of the Faithful wish to recline on one of these couches, it contracts to his size and then returns to its original size once he has installed himself upon it. A most sumptuous banquet then proceeds, with exquisite foods served by the angels out of containers made of gold and gems, followed by the perfuming of the 60 Muslim, $ah.h, vol. 1, 112. 61 Ibn Kathir, Nihiya, vol. 2, 301-2. 62 El-Saleh, La viefutur, 62. 63 The following account is based on the integrated narrative of SuyulT, Durar, 24 ff. 228</page><page sequence="15">RHETORIC FOR THE SENSES Faithful with musk and amber sprayed by the fluttering wings of birds dipped in perfume. All the while, God is occluded by curtains of pearls and curtains of light,64 but these are removed once the banquet is over. And God states:65 Welcome 0 my worshippers and guests. Angels: delight my worshippers with music. The Angels then proceed to fetch the musicians of Paradise, they being the huris and flutes. The flutes are attached to branches of trees, each branch carrying 70,000 flutes. A breeze blows from below the divine Throne and enters the flutes and makes them sound tunes the bet- ter of which were never heard. God then tells the huris: enrapture my worshippers, which they do with sweet songs. When the Faithful then tell God how much they enjoyed hearing his words (this being the Koran), He orders one of the angels to set up a platform made of as many steps as there are prophets, who are then seated according to their station with Muham- mad occupying the most elevated position. The rest of the throngs pres- ent then sit on dunes of musk and amber, and then the caller calls: 0 Abraham, rise and speak to your nation. God's Intimate then rises to his feet and reads the Tablets revealed to him to their end, and then sits down. Then follows the call from the most elevated heights to Moses, who says: Yes 0 Lord! and rises to his feet, and reads the Torah from beginning to end, then sits down, whereupon the call arrives from God the Elevated to Jesus, saying: rise and speak to thy people, whereupon he rises and reads the Gospel to its very end, and sits. Whereupon the call from God comes: 0 David! David says: Yes 0 Lord! God then says: ascend the platform and let my loved ones hear from thee ten portions of the Book of Psalms. David thereupon rises to his feet and reads the Psalms in ninety different voices, and those assembled are greatly enraptured by David's voice, which causes them to cry for joy ... Once they have recovered from their rapture God Almighty asks them: have you ever heard a sweeter voice than this? and they say: no, 0 Lord, never has a voice so sweet reached our ears. Whereupon the call from God Almighty comes, saying: my beloved Muhammad, ascend the platform and recite [the Koranic chapters of] Taha and Yasin. Muhammad there- fore ascends the platform and recites them, and exceeds David's voice in beauty by seventy times. The people there assembled are entranced, as are the seats upon which they sit, and the lantern of the Throne, and the Angels likewise undulate with rapture, and likewise the huris and the boys. Nothing possessing a soul remains unmoved by the voice of the Prophet, may God's praise be upon him. Then God says: have you heard the recitations of my prophets? and they say: Yes 0 Lord our God. He says to them: do you wish to hear the recitation of your Lord? and they 64 Tabari, Tafsir, vol. 26, 108-9. 65 SuyuiiT, Durar, 28-9. 229</page><page sequence="16">RHETORIC FOR THE SENSES say with one voice: we desire nothing but this. Ibn CAbbas [the tradi- tionist] narrated: then the Lord most elevated recites [the Koranic chapter] of al-Rahman, and, in another text, al-An'am, and upon hearing the recitation of the Truth, the most elevated, they all faint with rapture, and entranced are the Angels and the Veils and the palaces and the trees, and the leaves flutter and clap, and the birds chirp and sing, and the rivers undulate with the pleasure of the recitation by the most Precious, the most Powerful, and the Throne ripples with pleasure, and the divine Chair bends with wonderment, and nothing in Paradise remains without trembling with longing for God Almighty. The scene continues in what seems to be a fairly late addition to the repertoire: It is also narrated that the people of Paradise wish neither to eat nor to drink unless they hear the recitation of the Lord the most elevated, but to enjoy its sweetness and beauty. When they awaken from their rapture, the Lord the most elevated says to them: my worshippers, have you any other wishes? and they say: Yes; It remains for us to see your gracious Face. The Lord the most elevated then says: 0 Cherub, lift the veil between me and my worshippers. The angel then lifts the veil, and a wind blows unto them that causes their clothes to shine, that beautifies their faces and clears their hearts and pleases their bodies ... The Lord the most elevated then says to Cherub: Lift the greatest veil between me and my worshippers. And when this is lifted off His Face he calls: who am I? and they say: you are God. God says: I am peace, you are the peaceful, I am the believer, you are the believers, I am the beloved and you the beloved; this is my Speech: hear it, and this is my Light: behold it, and this is my Face: view it. So they look at the Face of the Truth the most elevated, with no intermediaries and no veils, and when the lights of Truth shine upon their faces, their faces are illuminated, and they remain looking at the Face of Truth for three hundred years. The rise of this sublime spectacle to its crescendo mirrors, of course, world hierarchies. But the most salient feature for this essay is not this matter, but rather that it is an ascent towards the most sublime of delights, indeed, to the limit of all possibilities which, apart from the pleasure taken from this spectacle, are limitless, and it is to this limitlessness of visual pleasure that the majority of the Blessed revert, for, as al-Ghazall stated: He whose love for God in the world was driven by the wish for the delights of Paradise and the huris and palaces, is admitted to heaven to fulfill what he desires, playing with boys and enjoying women, for such are the bounds of his pleasure in the afterlife ... whereas he whose only aim is the God of the KaCba and the All-Possessing, and who was overcome only by his love ... is placed upon a seat of truth by a capable King. The Faithful thus enjoy orchards and delights in gardens with the huris and the boys, whereas those closer to God are ever present in His Presence, ever gazing 230</page><page sequence="17">RHETORIC FOR THE SENSES 231 at His Presence, holding in contempt the bliss of the gardens ... This is why the Apostle of God, may God's praise be upon him, said: The majority of dwellers in Paradise are simpletons (al-buluh).66 AzIz AL-AZMEH University of Exeter " Al-Ghazalh, Mahabba, 81-2.</page></plain_text>
