<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNCERTAINTY, HUMILITY, AND ADAPTATION IN THE TROPICAL FOREST: THE AGRICULTURAL AUGURY OF THE KANTU'1 V Michael R. Dove East-West Center The first and in some respects most important stage of the swidden cycle of the Kantu' of West Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) consists of selecting a favorable site based on augury from seven species of forest birds. Evidence suggests that the relationship between augury and favorable conditions for swidden cultivation is random, and that this randomness is culturally enhanced by the rules of the augural system itself. What is the meaning of this metaphoric throw of the dice at this critical point in the swidden cycle? What insights does it offer into the unparalleled historic success of swidden agriculture in achieving sustainable use of tropical forests? I suggest that the augural system is a statement that is "saying something of some? thing" (to use Geertz's [1972:26-29] phrase), and what it says is that the environ? ment is indeterminate, that knowledge of it is imperfect, and that systematic management strategies are ill advised. This article intends to show that the selection of swidden sites is problematic because of the large number of environmental variables that differentiate sites and because the particular variables associated with swidden success change unpre? dictably from year to year. My thesis is that the augural system, through both instrumental and symbolic means, helps to randomize swidden behavior and mini- mize a tendency towards systematization. This promotes intrahousehold and inter? household diversity in swidden strategies, which helps to ensure a successful adaptation to a complex and uncertain environment. I will further argue that this traditional system of adaptation provides a needed lesson to development planners in the virtues and ills of, respectively, indeterminate versus determinate strategies for resource use in the tropical forest. There is a precedent for this analysis in Moore's (1957) pioneering analysis of scapulimancy (bone divination) among the Naskapi Indians of Labrador. He con? cluded that divination helped to randomize Naskapi hunting strategies, which maxi- mized their chances of success against nonterritorial herbivores whose location on any given day was also random. Lawless (1975) studied divination in a context of ecological change in Northern Luzon, and describes how such a system evolves as resources become scarce. In a related vein, Rappaport (1968) shows how ritual cycles regulate the relations among people, pig herds, and the natural environment in highland New Guinea. The linkage between ritual and ecology in all of these cases is instrumental: ritual practice has consequences that in turn have direct economic 145</page><page sequence="2">146 ETHNOLOGY or ecological implications. The Kantu' augural system links ritual to ecology not just instrumentally, but also symbolically and pedagogically. ADAPTATION TO UNCERTAINTY IN THE TROPICAL FOREST The Kantu' are a tribal people living along tributaries ofthe Kapuas River in West Kalimantan. They are Ibanic speakers and share most cultural traits with the well- described Iban of Sarawak. The Kantu' meet their market needs by tapping rubber and their subsistence needs by growing rice and other cultigens in swiddens. Every year each Kantu' household makes an average of two-to-three swiddens, with a total area of 4.6 hectares per household. Their cultivation is constrained by the character of the local environment, notably its high degree of uncertainty. Several variables are crucial to swidden success; viz., the amount and timing of annual rainfall, the magnitude and timing of riverine flooding, and the types, location, and severity of pest outbreaks. All these vary greatly from one year to the next. This variation makes the selection of swidden sites problematic. For example, swiddens cut from primary forest will yield very good harvests in a year with a drought of sufficient length to thoroughly dry and burn the felled timber. Otherwise, such swiddens will burn and yield poorly. Similarly, swiddens cut in the riverine flood zones will yield well, because ofthe rich alluvial soils, as long as there is only minimal flooding. But if flooding submerges the rice plants for more than a few days, these swiddens will fail. The difficulty of matching swidden type and location with annual environmental fluctuations is reflected in the fact that two out of three Kantu' households do not reap sufficient swidden rice for their needs. This level of failure is common for swidden systems in Borneo (Table 1). Table 1 Rates of Swidden Harvest Failure in Borneo Group Location Harvest Failure Source Note: "Harvest Failure" represents the percentage of households in the study community(s) that did not reap a harvest sufficient for one year's needs. The human tendency to prepare for the future on the assumption that it will be like the past is especially strong in environments characterized by great uncertainty and risk, like the tropical forest. During my fieldwork, for example, the members of one</page><page sequence="3">AGRICULTURAL AUGURY OF THE KANTU' 147 household observed that floods of sufficient duration to destroy the rice crop had not occurred for several years. They reasoned on this basis that the likelihood of such a flood occurring during the coming year was relatively high, and so they decided to locate all of their coming year's swiddens on high ground. Cyclical resonance is a key heuristic device in many ecological models, in industrial societies as well as tribal societies (Henderson 1987:253; cf. Dove 1985:76). But there is no evidence of cyclical patterns in rainfall or flooding in Kalimantan. Consequently, the nonoccur- rence of a rice-destroying flood during a three-year period does not affect the statistical likelihood of such a flood during the following year: it is no more or less likely than in any other year. Anticipation of a flood (or a drought) will more often be wrong than right, therefore, and it will produce poor harvests more often than good ones. The best strategy for the aforementioned household, accordingly, was to prepare neither for a year with a flood nor a year without a flood, but for an average year; i.e., a year with some percentage likelihood of a flood. The best way for a household with multiple swiddens to do that is to mix its swiddens between the flood zone and the nonflood zone. For a household with only a single swidden, the best strategy is to locate it across both zones or, if that is not possible, to randomly locate it in one zone or the other. These principles of diversification apply not only to flooding characteristics, but also to the two other local environmental variables of special relevance to swidden success: forest type (primary versus secondary) and drainage type (dryland versus swampland). It is no less risky to draw conclusions about the future based on the past behavior of one's fellow farmers than on the past behavior of the environment. The Kantu' are keen observers of one another's harvest successes and failures, and when one household enjoys conspicuous success, other households are tempted to copy its strategies. Most differences in harvest success are not due to differences between households in the wisdom of the swidden strategy, but are due to the purely serendipitous fit (or its lack) between this strategy and the character of the local environment in a given year. Since marked agricultural success is serendipitous, any attempt to associate a particular strategy with success and then imitate it will result in poor harvests more often than good ones. The best preparation for the average household is to follow its own, diversified swidden strategy. Individual household swidden strategies maximize the frequency of occurrence of some successful harvests within the longhouse. If households shared swidden strategies, then all of the households in a longhouse would tend to have good or bad harvests at the same time. By not sharing swidden strategies, some households usually will have good harvests while some will not, a fact that is fundamental to the Kantu' system of food security. While the harvests of many households fall short of subsistence needs in an average year, the overall harvest of the longhouse typically exceeds its total needs, because the harvest surpluses of the households that do well more than counterbalance the deficits of the households that do poorly. This was the case in the Kantu' longhouse studied. For example, during the first study year, although 57 per cent of households reaped harvests insufficient for their</page><page sequence="4">148 ETHNOLOGY own needs (with average shortfalls of 21 per cent), the total longhouse harvest exceeded the total longhouse rice requirements by over 3 per cent. There are strong longhouse institutions for transferring rice from harvest-surplus households to harvest-deficient households (Dove 1988:161-162), principally as payment in kind for swidden labor. During the year following the aforementioned harvest, more than 40 per cent of the surplus rice in the longhouse was transferred to the rice-deficit households as payment for wage labor (with much of the remaining surplus being distributed either under other arrangements or to households in other longhouses). THE KANTU' AUGURAL SYSTEM Divination comprises a major part of the traditional belief system of the Kantu\ as it does among other Ibanic peoples and most of the other tribal peoples of Borneo.4 Kantu' divination is based on the premise that the major deities ofthe spirit world have foreknowledge of human events and that out of benevolence they endeavor to communicate this to the Kantu' through the medium of natural phenom? ena. If the Kantu' are able to read the intended meaning of these phenomena correctly, they too can possess this foreknowledge. The deities can express themselves through a wide variety of phenomena, but most commonly through seven species of forest birds, believed to be the sons-in-law of the major deity, Singalang Burong. The birds vary in age and hence in authority. In ascending order they are the Nenak (White-rumped Shama), Ketupong (Rufous Piculet), Beragai (Scarlet-rumped Trogon), Papau (Diard's Trogon), Memuas (Banded Kingfisher), Kutok (Maroon Woodpecker), and Bejampong (Crested Jay) (cf. Richards 1972:64-65).7 Interpretation of augural messages from these birds is complex:8 it is minimally based on the particular species involved; the character of its flight; the type and number of its calls; the direction of its call or flight relative to the observer; its order within a sequence of messages from other omen birds; the time and place observed; the length of time sought; the activity for which sought; and the character of the household doing the seeking. The Kantu' deem omens from these birds to be relevant to all facets of Kantu' life but especially to swidden cultivation. Auguries are observed through most of the stages of swidden labor and typically are honored by proscription of swidden work on the day received. (An interesting comparative perspective on the augural system is seen in the Kantu' comment, "Just as the Christians proscribe work on Sundays, so do we proscribe work for omens.") Our principal interest here, however, is in the auguries that are deliberately sought for selection of a swidden site. This first stage ofthe swidden cycle, called beburong (to take birds or omens), consists of traversing the section of forest that is proposed for a new swidden and seeking favorable bird omens. Two separate, sequential omens are sought: thcpun burong (stem omen) and the pun nyuror (stem that gives off roots). The latter must be from a bird regarded as senior to the former in age. Obtaining these omens may take from a few days to a few weeks (cf. Freeman 1970:173), after which clearing of the forest for the</page><page sequence="5">AGRICULTURAL AUGURY OF THE KANTU' 149 swidden can begin. If no favorable omen is obtained, clearing is likely to proceed, but if an unfavorable omen is obtained the site may be rejected for that year. In any case, the character ofthe auguries received at this time?burong badas (good birds) versus burong jaV (bad birds)?is considered to be a major determinant of the ultimate success or failure ofthe swidden harvest. This augural sequence is practiced in its most complete form in the umai pun (stem swidden) in which each household plants its padi pun (stem rice), a variety believed to be of supernatural origin. Practice of the augural sequence will be somewhat different in the one, two, or three other swiddens that households cultivate each year. In swiddens lacking the ritual stem rice, the Kantu* may attenuate the augural sequence by accepting less favorable omens than they would in their stem swiddens; e.g., by accepting the iron in the duko' (brush sword) as the omen. In swampland swiddens (umai paiya9), the Kantu' may completely dispense with the initial augural sequence associated with site selection, although they would still honor unsolicited omens by halting work on the day observed. No Linkage to the Environment Is there is any empirical linkage between the behavior of the omen birds and the success or failure of the Kantu's swidden harvests? If there is, then the system of augury would merely be an indirect method of obtaining important agronomic data, which has been given the imprimatur of religion. There is certainly an empirical basis for the birds' behavior, in the sense that they have fixed and predictable habitats, feeding patterns, mating seasons, and so on. But is any of this relevant to swidden success? Are there either temporal or spatial patterns in the birds* behavior that might correlate with temporal or spatial variables critical to swidden success? With regard to temporal patterns, the principal birds from which omens are taken are not known for seasonal variation in behavior. There is some diurnal variation: the Kantu' say that most birds (such as the Rufous Piculet) do not call during the heat of the day nor (with the exception of the White-rumped Shama) when it is raining. But there is no indication that this variation is relevant to swidden success or failure. The evidence is somewhat more suggestive as regards spatial patterns. For example, Freeman (1960:85-86) found that the omen birds vary in the extent to which they approach human habitations; e.g., the Rufous Piculet is commonly seen and heard in the immediate vicinity of longhouses. There is related variation in the extent to which the omen birds frequent primary forest; e.g., the Kantu* say that the Rufous Piculet, along with most other birds, does not frequent primary forest. Since prox? imity to the longhouse and the primary/secondary forest distinction are important variables in the Kantu' swidden system (Dove 1983), such spatial variation suggests a possible empirical linkage between specific bird omens and specific swidden outcomes, but the linkage in fact is spurious. The rules of augural interpretation thoroughly scramble any possible empirical linkage between bird behavior and swidden success or failure. A linkage is ruled out</page><page sequence="6">150 ETHNOLOGY 12 not by ecology, therefore, but by culture. There are important but ecologically arbitrary rules for interpreting omens that effectively dissociate interpretation from the behavior ofthe birds. According to Kantu' augural lore, for example, some omen birds have more than one type of call, and the meaning of an omen varies according to which call is heard. Thus, the normal call ofthe Rufous Piculet is auspicious but its variant trill is inauspicious (cf. Freeman 1960:82-83). There appears to be no ecological significance to this variation. Similarly, there is great augural, but there can be no agricultural, significance attached to whether there are one or more calls of the Rufous Piculet (or other omen bird) heard. Equally important to interpretation (and equally irrelevant from an agricultural point of view) is whether the call is heard (or the bird is seen) to the observer's right or left. Augural interpretation is subject to an extravagant number and variety of additional rules and caveats, none of which appears any less arbitrary in an agroecological sense than the foregoing. The agroecological arbitrariness of augury is clearly illustrated in the perform? ance of betenong kempang (to divine from the kempang tree), a variant type of augury that the Kantu' sometimes practice instead of seeking omens at the prospec? tive swidden site. It consists in cutting a pole from the kempang tree (probably Artocarpus elasticus Reinw.ex BI.) and measuring and marking one's depa' (arms- breadth) on it. The augurer then proceeds to cut some of the underbrush on the site, after which he or she remeasures his or her arms-breadth against the kempang pole. If this measurement exceeds the initial one (indicating that the pole has "shrunk"), this augurs ill for the proposed site, but if the measurement falls short of the initial mark (if the pole has "grown"), this augurs well. Although this procedure is suscep? tible to unconscious influence on the part ofthe augurer, it nonetheless represents a cultural statement regarding the fundamental randomness of the augural system. The absence of an empirical causal association between omens and agricultural ecology is a prerequisite to Kantu' belief in the efficacy of omens. If a particular omen was obviously associated with some spatial or temporal variable relevant to swidden success, it would undercut its own supernatural character. In most systems of divination, it is precisely the impossibility of any such empirical connection that confers supernatural authority on the system (Aubert 1959:7,8). Divine intervention can only be seen in chance outcomes. This is reflected in the intentional modification of divinatory mechanisms to erase any empirical bias that may creep into the system. Thus, in the poison oracle of the Zande, larger chickens are given larger doses of poison (and vice versa) in order to make the outcome as "discriminating" (viz., random) as possible (Evans-Pritchard 1937:295,324). The poison's powers of dis? crimination are further tested by requiring it, in most instances, to first kill one fowl and then spare a second (Evans-Pritchard 1937:299). Similarly, in the ritual cock? fight of the Balinese, the attachment of the fighting spurs is adjusted to compensate for differences in size or strength between the two cocks (Geertz 1972:13). In the present case, any systematic ecological information that the birds might convey is negated (or, more correctly, it is obscured) by the investment of meaning in such nonsystematic phenomena as the number, type, and direction of their calls.</page><page sequence="7">AGRICULTURAL AUGURY OF THE KANTU' 151 No Linkage between Households The randomization of the connection between agroecological meaning and augu? ral meaning is reflected in, and further enhanced by, another distinctive feature of the rules governing augural interpretation: interhousehold sharing of omens is proscribed, and idiosyncratic interpretation of them is promoted. If omens in fact conveyed to the Kantu' empirically valid information about the environment, we might expect interhousehold sharing of this information, and we certainly would expect interhousehold agreement on what information is conveyed by what omen. But this is not the case. Augury is performed by each household on its own, usually by the eldest male. "Omens cannot be shared," the Kantu' say. If an auspicious omen became known to a neighboring household, the latter would want to join in taking it. Such sharing might abrogate the auspiciousness of the omen or, minimally, make it difficult for the original recipient household to obtain that omen again in future years. The Kantu' minimize sharing of omens by the simple expedient of keeping their own household's omens secret from other households. Sharing is also minimized by augural rules that tie omen interpretation to the varying composition and fortunes of the individual household. For example, the meaning of certain omens (e.g., the bacar call of the Rufous Piculet) is said to vary depending upon whether elders live in the household.15 Of more importance, many omens have no meaning other than to signify a reversal of the household's prior swidden fortunes, regardless of whether these were good or ill (cf. Sandin 1980:104-8). For example, if a household hears the bacar call of the Rufous Piculet when selecting a swidden site, they must abandon that site unless they (viz., their particular household) have never gotten a good harvest of rice. This arbitrary reversal of the meaning of omens makes it difficult to share them, increases interhousehold diversity in responses to omens, and generally enhances the randomizing effect of augury. Sharing of omens and systematization of augury's impact is also mitigated by the belief that augural interpretation is personal and idiosyncratic. The Kantu' say, Utai td ngau bidik kitai "This thing is a matter of our own fortune." As Metcalf (1976:108) claims for the Berawan (and erroneously denies for the Iban), each person builds up over his lifetime a personal and distinctive relationship with each of the omen birds. It is quite possible, as a result, for two augurers to assign completely opposing meanings to the same omen. This personal relationship, coupled with the fact that there is considerable interhousehold variation in the knowledge and intensity of observance of augural rules, ensures that there is consid? erable interhousehold variation in both the seeking of omens and the interpretation ofthe omens obtained.16 (See Figure 1.) The Kantu' recognize that the authority of omens is constrained by a variety of other factors. They do not say, for example, that good omens ensure a good harvest.17 Rather, they say that good omens ensure a better harvest than other households farming nearby who did not obtain good omens.

It shows, for example, that during the first year over 40 per cent of the households took nothing for their stem omen in at least one swidden, over 60 per cent took the White-rumped Shama, and over 30 per cent took the Rufous Piculet. conversely, is one that gives one a poorer harvest than others obtain (Dove 1985:88; Sandin 1980:119-20). The enhanced swidden fortunes that the Kantu' expect as a result of good omens are relative, therefore, and ultimately constrained by the general agroecological conditions prevailing in a given year. Another constraint is the seasonal cycle. The Kantu' state that good omens are of no avail if they do not plant their rice at the proper time. According to Kantu' belief, therefore, honoring local agroecological principles is a prerequisite to reaping the benefits of good omens. ANALYSIS OF THE AUGURAL SYSTEM To support the thesis that the Kantu' practice of bird augury randomizes their swidden strategies and thereby enhances their adaptation to their environment, evidence is required of disruption by augury of four different systematic relation-</page><page sequence="9">AGRICULTURAL AUGURY OF THE KANTU' 153 ships in the agroecology of the Kantu*: (i) between environmental conditions and the swiddens; (ii) between the swidden strategies of different households; (iii) among the multiple swiddens of the same household; and (iv) between the swidden strate? gies of the same household in different years. Evidence of the disruption of each of these relationships by augury is presented below. Environmental Conditions and Swidden Strategies The augural system counters any tendency to impose false systematization on the environment by severing any meaningful relationship between the environment, the omens, and the swiddens. This severance is achieved by the rules of augural interpretation, which are so structured as to strip all empirical content from informa? tion about the environment before passing it on to the swidden system as augural information. The Kantu' augural system, in its mediating position between bird behavior in the natural environment and harvest success in the swiddens, functions very much like a random numbers table (Aubert 1959:7). The metaphor of the random numbers table is not exact, however. Whereas the relationships among the digits in a random numbers table are by definition not meaningful, this is not the case within the body of augural lore of the Kantu'. For example, the interpretation of omens in terms of left/right and hot/cold dichotomies is clearly systematic and meaningful, and it relates to the wider cultural tradition of symbolic opposition that is found throughout Southeast Asia. The appropriateness of the metaphor of the random numbers table lies in the fact that the meaningful relations within the body of augural lore do not correlate with the meaningful relations between the environment and swidden agriculture. The absence of any such correlation means that the content of the augural system is arbitrary and could have been taken from many possible phenomena besides the behavior of forest birds. The birds came into use by virtue of their projective value. One of the most salient sensory inputs in the tropical rain forest is sound, especially that from (usually unseen) birds.18 This suggestion is supported by the fact that the seven omen birds are remarkable less for their appearance (Freeman 1960:97) than for the arresting character of their calls.19 These calls are also notable for their anthropomorphic character, evoking qualities of excitability, taciturnity, and so on (Richards 1972:66; cf. Freeman 1960:83). Interhousehold Variation in Swidden Strategies If one household appropriates another's omens and follows the swidden strategy dictated by them, it reduces the randomization and diversification of the swidden system at the interhousehold level. I have discussed above how such sharing is minimized by norms of secrecy, by the belief that augural interpretation varies according to the prior fortunes of the household, and by the belief that the interpre? tation of omens is in general a personal and idiosyncratic matter. The diversity in swidden strategies to which this ritual diversity contributes is shown in Figures 2</page><page sequence="10">154 ETHNOLOGY 20 and 3. Figure 2 shows that in the first year ofthe study, 7 per cent of all households made only one swidden, 50 per cent made two and 43 per cent made three or four; 50 per cent of the households made only primary forest swiddens, 7 per cent made only secondary forest swiddens, and 43 per cent made at least one of each; and so on. This diversity in swidden strategies is matched by diversity in swidden out? comes: there is no correlation (viz., rs=.05) between the first and second study years in the rankings of the sample households' swidden harvests (measured as the percentage of subsistence needs met). These levels of observed ritual and agricul? tural variation are consistent with my thesis regarding the randomizing function of augury. This thesis potentially explains beliefs regarding the consequences of deviation from the norm in both the augural system and the swidden system. If, as the Kantu' believe, good omens give the recipient household a better harvest than other house? holds, and if obtaining good omens is (at least in part) a function of the amount of time and knowledge devoted to omen-taking, then the more devout practitioners of augury should enjoy better agricultural fortunes than the less devout. If devoutness or thoroughness in omen-taking is equated with the extent to which swidden strate? gies are randomized, then this perceived association between omen-taking and swidden fortunes may indeed have an empirical basis. According to the ecological analysis presented at the outset of this study, the households that practice augury most strictly and locate their swidden sites most randomly will, on average and in the long run, reap better harvests than those that practice augury less strictly and locate their swidden sites more systematically. Just as the randomization thesis explains the association of bad omens and bad harvests, it can also potentially explain the occasional association of bad omens and good harvests. Some omens signify a reversal of the household's prior swidden fortunes. Such a reversal is not welcome to the average farmer enjoying a modest degree of success, but it is welcome to a farmer who has been doing so poorly that his fortunes can only improve. (Accordingly, the former would reject a prospective swidden site at which such an omen is encountered, while the latter would accept it.) The effect of this augural rule is to encourage unsuccessful farmers to pursue swidden strategies that differ both from the strategies of other farmers and from their own past strategies. The effect, that is, is to change the rules (whatever they are) under which the unsuccessful farmer has been operating. If randomization of swid? den strategies is as important, and if systematic behavior is as inimical, to harvest success as this study suggests, then a shakeup of swidden strategies may be just what the (continually) unsuccessful farmer needs. If randomization is the most successful strategy, then repeated swidden failure may well be due to nonrandom swidden strategies; in which case a disruption of established patterns would be beneficial. Intrahousehold Variation in Swidden Strategy In order for the augural system to achieve its theorized goal of randomizing swidden strategies, it must exert a randomizing pressure not only between house-</page><page sequence="11">AGRICULTURAL AUGURY OF THE KANTU' 155 Figure 2: Interhousehold Variation in Swiddens - 1st Year L. 60% O a No of Swiddem Forest Type Drainage Type MAJOR 5WIDDEN VARIABLES Flood Zone Figure 3: Interhousehold Variation in Swiddens - 2nd Year o No, of Swiddens Forest Type Drainage Type MAJOR SWIDDEN VARIABLES Fiood Zone DL = Dryland SF = Secondary Forest AFZ = Above Flood Zone SL = Swampland PF = Primary Forest FZ = Flood Zone DL/SL &amp; SF/PF &amp; AFZ/FZ = Mixtures</page><page sequence="12">156 ETHNOLOGY holds but within them. The necessity for randomization within the household is based on the fact that most Kantu' households cultivate multiple swiddens each year: the averages during the first and second years of study were 2.4 and 2.2 per household, respectively. The pursuit of similar versus dissimilar strategies in a single household's multiple swiddens can significantly affect the overall diversity of the swidden system. Of particular importance is the location of each swidden within a different microenvironment: in primary forest versus secondary forest, on dryland versus swampland, and in the riverine flood zone versus on higher ground. The more microenvironments that are exploited, the greater the diversity and long-term stability of the system. A randomizing strategy alone will not ensure exploitation of the maximum number of different microenvironments, however, because the incidence of each microenvironment within the swidden territory of the Kantu' is not the same (Table 2). Primary forest, swampland, and flood-zone land are all relatively scarce within the territory. As a result, they would be minimally represented in Kantu' swiddens if all swidden locations were selected randomly. Figure 4 shows, for example, that a household making three swiddens in a given year has a 14 per cent chance of randomly locating at least one on dryland and one in swampland, a 29 per cent chance of locating at least one in secondary forest and one in primary forest, and a 36 per cent chance of locating at least one within the flood zone and one above it.22 A pure "random-walk" strategy cannot maximize diversity, therefore, in an environment characterized by important but irregularly distributed variation. Table 2 Incidence of Different Microenvironmental Variables within the Territory of the Study Longhouse. % of Long? house Territory FOREST TYPE Primary Secondary DRAINAGE TYPE Dryland Swampland FLOOD ZONE Above Within 86% 14% This problem is resolved through some restriction on the scope of the augural system. The Kantu', as mentioned earlier, practice augury in its fullest form only when selecting sites for their stem swiddens, where they plant their ritual stem rice. They practice a more attenuated form of augury in their other dryland swiddens, and they usually neglect it altogether in their swampland swiddens. This diminution of augural observance in what amounts to over one-half of all swiddens, allows the Kantu' to select their remaining swidden sites so as to incorporate all possible environmental variation in their swiddens. The amount of intrahousehold swidden diversity thereby achieved is much greater than could be achieved under a random-</page><page sequence="13">AGRICULTURAL AUGURY OF THE KANTU' 157 Figure 4: Intrahousehold Variation in Swidden Strategies: Random Basis 4 swiddens Flood Zone Figure 5: Intrahousehold Variation in Swidden Strategies: Actual Basis DL/SL 5F/PF AFZ/FZ 4 swiddens Flood Zone DL = Dryland SF = Secondary Forest AFZ = Above Flood Zone SL = Swampland PF = Primary Forest FZ = Flood Zone DL/SL &amp; SF/PF &amp; AFZ/FZ = Mixtures Note: The scale of the Y axis in Figure 5 is greater than in Figure 4.</page><page sequence="14">158 ETHNOLOGY izing strategy. Among households making two or more swiddens in a single year, the distribution of swiddens among the three major microenvironmental categories is much greater than would be expected by chance alone (with the possible exception of the flood-zone category), as a comparison of Figures 4 and 5 shows. Figure 5 shows, for example, that among households making three swiddens in either of the two study years, 100 per cent located at least one swidden on dryland and at least one in swampland, 91 per cent located at least one in secondary forest and one in primary forest, and 27 per cent located at least one within the flood zone and one on higher ground. In addition to the need to exploit irregularly distributed microenvironments, there is a second reason why augury is attenuated in swampland swiddens. The agro? ecological dynamics of these swiddens are quite different from those of normal dryland swiddens, as is the level and nature of their risk. Two of the principal hazards in dryland swiddens, the failure to obtain a thorough burn and prolonged inundation by flood waters, pose no threat in swampland swiddens. The vegetative cover on most of the swampland in the Kantu' territory today, by virtue of relatively frequent cropping, is grassland. In the event that the grasses cannot be burned, they are simply cut and mulched into the swamp soil. Also, the special rice varieties planted in the swampland swiddens possess unusually deep roots that heighten their resistance to water stress, enabling them to survive most floods. For these reasons, the selection of a site for a swampland swidden is less problematic than the selection of a site for a dryland swidden. (In addition, there are simply fewer sites to choose from: swampland comprises no more than 5 per cent of the Kantu' territory, and it is all concentrated along the valley's main river and streams.) Just as the exception proves the rule, the thesis of this study is supported by the nonuse of augury in that part of the farming system where there is less uncertainty and correspondingly less need for randomization. Yearly Variation in Household Swidden Strategies Systematic or patterned behavior from one year to the next violates a random response to environmental uncertainty just as much as systematic or patterned behavior between swiddens. Yet the impulse toward behavioral patterning from one year to the next is probably the strongest of all. Reliance on precedent is the foundation of most empirical knowledge, and the psychological predisposition for such reliance increases as uncertainty increases (Aubert 1959:1 ln), notwithstanding the fact that the practical utility of such reliance decreases by the same measure. Augury is the perfect device for countering this predisposition because its episte? mology depends upon the evocation of chancelike decisions. The desired impression of supernatural communication can be sustained only if there is a clear de-coupling of augural decision-making from any historical precedent. The Kantu' system of augury, in fact, discourages reliance upon precedent. With the possible exception of the previously discussed augural rule that divines a reversal of past fortune from very</page><page sequence="15">AGRICULTURAL AUGURY OF THE KANTU' 159 potent omens (for which rule a randomizing impact has already been argued), augural interpretation is never based on historical phenomena. With the additional possible exception of omens whose significance is said to apply to three successive farm years, the meaning and prescribed courses of action taken from current omens are never tied to past omens. The year-to-year diversity in household swidden strategies that results from this augural structure is clear in Kantu' swidden strate? gies. Regarding number of swiddens, for example, 64 per cent of the households studied did not make the same number during the second year of the study that they made in the first year. There were equally significant changes between the two study years in the incorporation of major environmental variables into household swidden strategies. Figure 6 shows, for example, that 57 per cent of the households made at least one secondary forest swidden in the first year (viz., "Some SF") but none during the second year, or they made at least one during the second year but none during the first. Figure 6 also shows that 50 per cent of the households made at least one secondary forest swidden and at least one primary forest swidden during the first year (viz., "Mixed SF/PF") but not during the second, or they did the reverse.

Perhaps the most significant differ? ence between the two systems of belief is the indeterminism of the augural system and determinism ofthe development system. The augural system assumes a complex reality, the perfect understanding and mastery of which is foresworn. In contrast, the development system assumes a simpler reality, whose understanding and mastery it demands. According to the augural system, systematic attempts to decipher and thus master the environment can only worsen society's ability to productively exploit it. According to the development paradigm, productive exploitation ofthe environment is only achievable through systematic efforts to comprehend and master it. In the augural system, failure may reflect an effort to take too much information into account (viz., through trying to discern and respond to purported environmental patterns). In contrast, failure in the development paradigm is interpreted by its proponents as evidence of insufficient information. Failure in the indeterministic system of augury prompts a call (through cultural rules promoting changes in behavior) for more indeterminism; failure in the deterministic system of develop? ment prompts calls for more determinism. The two paradigms are as different in their results as in their characters. The indeterministic paradigm has produced systems of adaptation to the tropical forest like swidden agriculture, which is still the most sustainable system of cultivation ever developed for this environment. The deterministic paradigm has produced, in contrast, a serial commitment to one "magic bullet" after another; whether cattle ranches and pulp plantations in the Amazon, oil palm plantations and transmigration projects in Borneo, or miracle rices and trees. No sooner are such schemes applied, than fatal flaws surface that prompt a search for equally deterministic replacements. For example, the failure of the Indonesian transmigration program to meet one objective after another has resulted in only a narrow restatement of objectives, not a reconsideration of the broader paradigm. Figure 7 compares the deterministic char? acter of the transmigration program with the nondeterministic character of the Kantu' economy. One fundamental distinction between the deterministic and indeterministic para? digms was aptly demonstrated during a meeting that I attended with some Kantu' elders and the local subdistrict head. The subdistrict head made a ninety-minute speech directing the Kantu' to stop making swiddens and start making wet rice fields instead, whereupon a prominent headman and shaman responded, "Don't tell us how to make wet rice fields, rather tell us which omen birds are best for swiddening. Instead of telling us useless things, tell us which bird omens are the best." In effect the headman rejected the proposal to stop swiddening, proposing instead that they try to swidden better. The headman's retort is notable both for its rejection of overly simplistic and deterministic adaptations to the tropical forest, and for its implicit</page><page sequence="17">AGRICULTURAL AUGURY OF THE KANTU' 161 Figure 7: The Kantu' Economy And The Transmigration Program The Kantu' Economy Swampland Swiddens Food Cropping Non-rice Crops Economic Base Dryland Swiddens X Rice Rubber Cultivation ?Cask Cropping Pepper Cultivation Hunting Hunting and Gathering k Fishing Gathering Forest Products Trading The Indonesian Transmigration Program Economic -?

A fundamental difference between the deterministic and indeterministic para? digms is the degree of hubris in the one and humility in the other. The augural system of belief contains an implicit, structural admission of incomplete knowledge and the limitations of the system. The development paradigm contains no such admissions: it regards incomplete knowledge as a temporary and remediable fault in a system whose correct functioning presumes complete knowledge. The difference between the two paradigms in terms of humility and hubris is illustrated in the Kantu* term for the first day of augury-seeking at a prospective swidden site, ninga tanah (to listen to the earth). This term refers literally to the immediate objective of listening for bird omens; but it also refers metaphorically to the ultimate objective of ascer- taining the receptivity of the natural environment to a proposed human use of it. There is a marked difference between this attitude and the attitude taken by most development theorists. Compare "listening to the earth" with "Managing Planet Earth," which was the title given to a recent special issue ofthe Scientific American on global development. The development community is not as humble, in contemplating their ability to understand and productively intervene in the development process, as the record of postwar development suggests they should be. This may be linked to their determi? nistic models, which engender overconfidence and promote mistaken courses of action; whereas indeterministic models engender doubt (Norgaard and Dixon 1986:310). At this stage in the co-evolution of human society and the natural environment, a little more doubt about human wisdom and abilities may be a good thing. It may be good to start asking, as Goodland (1990:176) writes, "How bad would it be if you were wrong?" The Kantu' system of agricultural augury merits our attention because of what it demonstrates about successful adaptation to the tropical forest environment. Its first lesson is that systematic, integrated development planning is inappropriate for this environment. Sustainable adaptation to tropical forests requires unintegrated planning (cf. Thompson et al. 1986:116-7), not optimum solutions but pluralistic ones (Norgaard 1988:619), which properly emphasize the complexity of develop? mental situations and the difficulty of carrying out effective intervention (Norgaard 1989:52). CONCLUSIONS The augural system of the Kantu' is a phenomenon in and of history; there was a time when it did not exist in its present form and there will come a time when this is again the case. Augury is depicted here as it was in the non-Christian, non-Islamic interior of Borneo in the 1970s and 1980s. The early colonial, travel, and ethno-</page><page sequence="19">AGRICULTURAL AUGURY OF THE KANTU* 163 graphic literature suggests that it was present in the nineteenth century but not for too many centuries before that. The origins of augury are often linked to the origins of rice cultivation in Bornean mythology. Gomes (1911:278-300) recounts an Iban tale of a time when the Iban subsisted on only forest fruits and cultivated tubers. This ended when a young Iban known as Siu was taught by Singalang Burong (one of the paramount Iban deities) how to plant rice and observe omens. This treatment of rice and omens as part of a single cultural complex supports the thesis of the current study, since it is in agriculture that the indeterminacy addressed by augury is most prevalent and most pressing, and since within agriculture it is rice that is most problematic. Harrisson (1960:51) suggested, based on ethnological data, that rice was of "relatively recent origin" in Borneo, and Crawfurd (1820) estimated that it was introduced in the sixteenth or seventeenth century. In fact, rice has been present in the archeological record of Borneo for millennia, but this does not mean that it had the predominant role in Bornean agriculture that it has today. Comparative data (and my own research on the role of non-rice cultigens in contemporary ritual) suggest that the early tribal economies of Borneo depended less on rice and more on non-rice grains (such as Setaria italica, Italian millet) and, especially, a variety of tubers (including Colocasia esculenta, taro), in association with more hunting and gather? ing than is currently the case. This subsistence base is less sensitive to environmental perturbations than is dry rice cultivation; and the randomizing role of augury would have been, accordingly, less important to it. A historical association between augury and environmentally sensitive rice culti? vation is supported by the relative lack of augury among Borneo's hunting and gathering peoples, the Punan. Contemporary scholarship has always indicated that augury and related beliefs are less developed among the Punan than among the agricultural Dayak. Hose and McDougall (1901:195) observe that the Punan at the turn of the century were then in the process of adopting augury, which was about the same time that they were beginning to adopt some of the Dayak's agricultural practices. The association of augury and the swidden cultivation of rice also is supported by the relative lack of augury among tribal groups like the contemporary Rungus of North Borneo,27 who cultivate rice not in environmentally chancy swid? dens but in irrigated fields, where environmental perturbations are more susceptible to human management. If the system of augury did indeed develop in conjunction with the development of the swidden-based cultivation of rice, it follows that any diminution in the importance of swidden rice might provoke a corresponding diminishment in the scope and authority of the augural system. There is clear evidence that the latter, at least, is happening. For example, whereas the Kantu' say that today the only swidden stages in which they really pay attention to omens are (in addition to the initial stage of site selection) nebas (slashing) and nebang (felling), they say that formerly they observed omens even during such relatively inconsequential substages as the reburn- ing of poorly burned swiddens (mandok) and the transplanting of swamp rice seedlings (nambak). A weakening of not just the scope but the authority of the</page><page sequence="20">164 ETHNOLOGY augural system appears to be reflected in the recent emergence of institutions for abrogating the impact of inauspicious omens; e.g., the begelaf (offering ceremony) in which chickens and perhaps a pig are sacrificed to the spirits. Formerly, only a ritual expert known as the tuai burong (bird elder) could abrogate undesirable omens. This office is no longer found among the Kantu', suggesting that the abrogation of omens has become so commonplace as to no longer require a ritual expert. These contractions in the historical scope and authority ofthe augural system may be explained by the expansion of the Kantu' economy beyond its traditional con? fines. The comparatively recent development of swamp swiddens (with their dimin- ished level of uncertainty) has increased the certainty of returns within the swidden system. Outside the swidden system, the development this century of pepper culti? vation and, especially, rubber cultivation, has significantly increased the ability of the Kantu' to survive swidden harvest failures, by providing them with a secure source of tradeable cornmodities with which to purchase rice from the market (see Dove in press). These developments have increased the overall stability of the Kantu' agricultural economy, which in turn has arguably decreased the dependence of the Kantu' on their traditional dryland rice swiddens. This decreased dependence may have increased the Kantu' toleration of risk in the swidden system, thereby making omen-based randomization somewhat less important than was once the case. NOTES 1. Research was initially carried out among the Kantu' from 1974 to 1976 with support from the National Science Foundation (Grant #GS-42605). Additional data were gathered between 1979 and 1985 during periodic field trips to Kalimantan, with support from the Rockefeller and Ford Founda- tions and the East-West Center (EAPI). This analysis was written during the tenure of fellowships in Yale University's Program in Agrarian Studies and the East-West Center's Population Institute and Environment and Policy Institute.

The author alone is responsible for the analysis presented here. 2. The Kantu' system of swidden agriculture has been described in Dove (1985). 3. These quantitative data are drawn largely from two sets of swiddens planted by the Kantu' longhouse Tikul Batu: 34 swiddens planted by fourteen households in the fall of 1974 and harvested in the spring of 1975 (referred to as the "1st year's swiddens"), and 35 swiddens planted by sixteen households in the fall of 1975 and harvested in the spring of 1976 (referred to as the "2nd year's swiddens"). 4. Bird augury has been mentioned by nearly every Western observer to visit Borneo since the mid-nineteenth century (for a representative sampling see Hose and McDougall 1912; Geddes 1956; and Low 1848). Harrisson (1960), Jensen (1974), Richards (1972), and Sandin (1980) prepared detailed descriptions of augury. Freeman (1960) carried out the first analytical study of (Iban) augury, and concluded that it served an essentially psychological function of minimizing anxiety. King (1977) and Metcalf (1976) subsequently debated whether augural interpretation was fixed or subject to individual interpretation, a matter of some relevance to this essay. 5. Freeman (1960:80) writes, "Iban augury is thus, in essence, a beneficent and beneficial commentary on human purposes, a system of divine guidance for the well-being of man." While</page><page sequence="21">AGRICULTURAL AUGURY OF THE KANTU' 165 Freeman (1960:81) says that "It is not an augury in itself which produces results, either good or bad, but rather the behavior of men in respect of it," other observers differ as to whether the role of the deities is limited to foretelling the future as opposed to changing it and, thus, whether divination amounts to supplication (Metcalf 1976:116; King 1977:80-82). 6. Less common omen mediums include the beruang (Malayan sun bear), bintang andau (the sun and stars seen together in early morning), ingkat (Western tarsier), kayu rebah (falling tree), kenawang (red-headed krait), kijang (barking deer), kuai (chameleon), merajus (rainbow), munsang (common palm civet), pelanok (mouse deer), pungo' rebah (falling stump), remaung (tiger), rusa' (sambhar deer), and ulat buluh (hairy caterpillar). Other important media are dreams (cf. Gomes 1911:161; Richards 1972:79-80) and the livers of domestic pigs (cf. Hose and McDougall 1901:181). 7. The zoological names for the omen birds, in order, are: Copsychus malabaricus Scopoli, Sasia abnormis Temminek, Harpactes duvauceli Temminck, Harpactes diardii Temminck, Lacedo pul- chella Horsfield, Platylophus galericulatus Cuvier, and Blythipicus rubiginosus. Some Kantu* add to this list the beriyok tailor-bird (Orthotomus spp.), ranked below the White-rumped Shama, and the lang burak mwa white-faced eagle or Brahminy Kite (Haliastur indus Boddaert), ranked above the Maroon Woodpecker. See Freeman (1960:78-79), King (1977:67), and Metcalf (1976;110-111) on the problematic status of the Brahminy Kite as an omen bird. 8. Freeman (1960:84-85) suggests that augural interpretation is based on the anthropomorphic symbolism of the bird's call, the similarity of the call to other sounds, the bird's physical appearance, the bird's habitual behavior, and the bird's movement. 9. Harrisson (1960:24) writes, "It is only a mild falsification to imply that the basic relationship between man and his universe over nine-and-a-half tenths of Borneo is set in a loose framework of a fairly elaborate applied ornithology." 10. Beburong besi (to take the iron as an omen) differs from normal omen-taking in that clearing of the forest is begun in the absence of an auspicious bird omen. The decision to do so may be due to either the swidden's lack of ritual importance or the household's own ritual slackness. Gomes (1911:155) describes an archaic and perhaps related practice wherein "if a piece of gold be hidden in the ground, the hearing of the proper omen birds may be dispensed with." 11. There are augural systems in which the actual and intended function of the system is to highlight an empirical association between bird behavior and local ecology; e.g., Bharara (1982) on the prediction of drought from birds in Rajasthan, India. 12. Some observers maintain that linkages also are ruled out by ecology. Thus, Harrisson (1960:23) writes (of another Dayak group), "Nor do the Kayans use as omen birds ... any that have anything actually *to do' in fact with the operations (house building, marriage, canoe journeys, rice planting, etc.) which these birds powerfully influence and not infxequently decide." 13. "The intricacies of the subject are great. The different combinations of these voices of nature are endless, and it is difficult to know in each special case whether the spirits intend to foretell good or bad fortune. It is not an unusual thing to see old men, industrious and sensible in ordinary matters of life, sitting down for hours discussing probable effect on their destiny of some special combination of omens" (Gomes 1911:159). 14. In cases of illness, a senior male sometimes performs augury on behalf of the longhouse as a whole, but in the case of swidden cultivation the augural unit is normally the household. The only exception to this occurs when the longhouse farms for the first time in a tract of primary forest, when augury may be performed on a longhouse-wide basis in a ritual called ngali tanah (digging the earth). Among the Iban studied by Freeman (1970:73), a senior augurer initiates the augural stage of the swidden cycle, but each household carries out its own augury. 15. The presence of elders usually indicates a three-generation household. This is an important determinant of consumer/producer ratios and, thus, is highly relevant to swidden labor strategies (Dove 1984) and success or failure. Even so, there is no empirical association between this variable and any particular bird omen. 16. Freeman (1960:90) writes, "Despite a general acceptance of the meaning of augural signs it is not unusual, therefore, for the recommendations of one augur to differ from those of another." I suggest that this variation is not a problem in the augural system but is, rather, one of its purposes.</page><page sequence="22">166 ETHNOLOGY 17. Freeman (1960:81) quotes an augurer as saying, "Even though one hears a good augury ten times over, the harvest will not be an outstanding one without sufficient work." 18. Cf. Feld's (1990) ethnography of sound among the Kaluli of Papua New Guinea, in which he argues that the principal metaphoric source for weeping, poetics, and song are the birds of the rain forest. 19. The Rufous Piculet and Maroon Woodpecker both make the distinctive noises characteristic of woodpeckers; while the Crested Jay and Banded Kingfisher are noted for the abundance, volume and distinctiveness of their calls; and the White-rumped Shama is known for the melody of its call (Delacour 1947:175,234,347; Glenister 1951:192; Holmes and Nash 1990:50,58; Smythies 1981: 201,233,244, 301-302,426; cf. Gomes 1911:153; Harrisson 1960:61). 20. Swamp swiddens, because of their unique ecological character, were excluded from the calculations pertaining to forest types and flood-zone types in Figures 2, 3, 5, and 6. 21. These are actually not distinct microenvironments but microenvironmental variables, some of which overlap. Thus, a single location may be classified as (e.g.) dryland, located above the flood zone, and covered in secondary forest. 22. These calculations are based on estimates that the percentage of the study territory covered by primary versus secondary forest is 11 per cent versus 89 per cent, the percentage covered by swampland versus dryland is 5 per cent versus 95 per cent, and the percentage located within versus above the riverine flood zone is 14 per cent versus 86 per cent. 23. The fact that exceptionally auspicious omens may apply to as many as three successive farm years, during each of which the prescribed course of action is unchanged, may represent a true exception to the randomizing structure of augury. It is noteworthy that no omens, however auspicious, are accorded lifelong efficacy. 24. The difference is made even plainer in a rhetorical question in the introductory article to the issue, "What kind of planet do we want? What kind of planet can we get?" (Clark 1989:47). (This publication was drawn to my attention in a seminar by Hugh Iltis.) 25. This is not to suggest that all tropical forests resemble those in Borneo, only that the problems of human adaptation to them are broadly similar. 26. Ethnological evidence (Harrisson 1960:24), suggesting that the role of birds in tribal custom, belief, and art may once have been eclipsed by other fauna (notably the centipede and the scorpion), supports this notion of a historically lesser role for augury. 27.
