<plain_text><page sequence="1">ICONOGRAPHY OF SRI-LAKSHMI IN SRIVATSA-FORM IN TAMIL COUNTRY R. Mohana Bai Lakshmi, the chief consort of Visnu, has the appellation 'Sri'. The word 'Sri' signifies "the sign of beauty", "the token of good fortune", "the mark of royal power", and is synonymous with luck, prosperity, grace, happiness and royal domain. She is widely worshipped in our country by all religious sects, including Jains and Buddhists. Iconographically she has been differently represented from the earlier times, always with the central theme of the origin of the universe. She is not merely the goddess of prosperity, luck, auspiciousness, but she is the root and essence of the universe. She has her own forms, anthropomorphic, symbolic, zoomorphic and botanic.1 The earliest symbolic representation of Sri-Lakshmi is in Srivatsa form. K.V. Soundararajan while explaining Srivatsa symbol and its antecedent motif opines "elite and the folk draw from the same common pool of beliefs and cult symbolism. Their sustenance in an interlinked character is nowhere better brought out than in the development of aniconic motifs of which doubtless the figurai motifs pertaining to Sri, Srimadevata and Srivatsa would be the most pervasive. Its temporal vicissitudes are spread over a fairly long span of life, from the proto-historic stages and as exemplified in metal, stone and terracotta. The origins are to be seen in the copper-bronze figures which have a prominent but featureless rounded head and two projecting arms and a heavy lower body with an emphasis on the womb area. It is certainly not produced in any truly artistic form in the early and intermediate stages until it becomes a popular motif for material prosperity both under Buddhism and Hinduism, and is coming to be designated as the Srivatsa symbol. The term Srivatsa itself is enigmatic as it integrates the agricultural wealth of Sri and the fertility or child- bearing potential reflected by the term "Vatsa". This proto historic symbol has a tribal charcter. Since it is used for a folk or festivity of community worship, these objects are found in Indus culture onwards". He further points out that the tribal motif merged with the "Greater cultural" pool of which they are "less cultural" parts and form a substratum trait. In Buddhism, Srimadevata was a floral, agricultural goddess of prosperity and green vegetation. In Hinduism, as Sri, or Srivatsa, she is part of the role of Visnu as preserver and is also his mascot.2</page><page sequence="2">Historical Archaeology, Epigraphy ; Numismatics &amp; Archives 1237 In the Tamil country in few sculptures, inscriptions and coins, this mode of the fusion of Srivatsa symbol of the goddess and her physical form is found. The identification of Sri with the Srivatsa symbol is so complete that she is not different from it. In a Megalithic burial ground at Visiriparai, in Udaiya Natham is found a stone pillar considered as mother goddess in the shape of Srivatsa symbol (Figure 1). This and the Mogur pillars are the earliest such symbolic motif of Sri in Tamil Nadu. In the Paliava and early Chola sculptures alone we get a developed Sri in Srivatsa symbolic form in which the hands and legs are curled up at the sides and without taking the face into account. From 6th to 9th century A.D. Sri was carved as independent sculpture or along with other deities. In Ariyalur Kothandarama temple, Lakshmi in Srivatsa symbolic form is carved. The temple belonged to 6th - 7th century A.D. and only two sculptures of the former temple exist now. They are the sculpture of Lakshmi and the lion pillar. The Sri-Lakshmi symbolic piece is 11" by 5". It has minute features. Seated on a lotus (figure 2) she has a karanda makuta ' mangala sutra , necklace and wears jewellery in ears, hand and chest. She has a chatra on whose both sides two ladies stand and above the shoulder two elephants pour water on her. Her hands and legs are floriated.3 Paliava ruler Paramesvaravarman built a temple at Kurram (Kanchipuram Dt.) in 7th century A.D. A plaque (Figure 3) from this temple has all the features described above, except the elephants standing on lotus with long stalk bathe her. In Tiruvalancheri (near Tiruthani) in the Siva temple a plaque of Sri Lakshmi is found (Figure 4). The hands and legs are floriated. She has Kirita makuta and chatra. Two lamps on two sides and sankha on the and left side and lotus on the right are found. This symbolises sankha nidhi and padmanidhi respectively. Of the two elephants from both sides, one does abisheka and the other is holding the water pot. The sculpture of late Paliava period (9th Century) from Kaveripakkam near Kanchipuram is now preserved in Madras Museum. It is on a stone slab (Figure 5) and is flanked by two elephants. The two animals are carved like the elephants bathing Lakshmi in Varaha Mandapa at Mahablipuram. The presence of two lamps suggests the auspicious character of the deity. On the two sides of the lotus seat are the sankha and padma nidhis indicated by lotus and conch oozing a curling roll of coins. Lakshmi wears svarnavaikakshaka. This ornament is seen on the figures of women and children. The figure without hands and feet is said to show that wealth has to be earned by</page><page sequence="3">1238 IHC: Proceedings , 61st ( Millennium ) Session, 2001 hard work and that the goddess will not come and offer it to anyone as she has no hands to give nor feet to walk. It is the emblem of the Archaeological Society of South India.4 A tiny copper image of Lakshmi in symbolic form, a unique piece of which is found among the bronzes of the Madras Museum, comes from the village of Enadi in Arantangi Taluk of Tanjore district (Figure 6). The legs and arms of the figure are skillfully floriated here and not merely curled as in the stone sculpture. She wears Svarnavaikaksaka, makuta as found in stone figure. She is seated Ãµ"n a lotus of many broad petals. C.Sivaramamurti dates it in the transitional period of art from the Paliavas to early Chola period i.e. - about the ninth century A.D.5 A plaque from Manimangalam in Chenagalput district, dated around the beginning of the seventh century A.D., is found with other deities like Siva, Parvati, Skanda and Narasimha. By the side of the seated Narasimha figure is seen Lakshmi in the form of Srivatsa on Padmasana (figure 7). In the Siva temple at Maduranthagam a sculptured panel depicts Visnu and Jyesthadevi. On the right side above Visnu's shoulder, Srivatsa and Ardhanaresvara are carved. This sculpture belongs to the 7th or 8th century A.D.6 The symbol of Lakshmi is introduced into the seal of the copper plate grants of kings e.g. the Velurpalayam copper plates which was issued by Nandivarman III, the Paliava ruler. They are five in number and consist of eight written sides. The outer face of the first and the last being completely blank. The breadth of each plate is abut 3-1/2" the ring measures 7" x 6-1/4". The seal bears a bull and an ornamental lamp-stand, on either side below this there appear the faint traces of an expanded lotus flower. Above the bull are engraved in one row eight symbols of which Goddess-Lakshmi flanked by two lamp stands occupies the centre. Another symbol which is recognisable is the Svastika. The remaining four are indistinct. Above this are two chauris mounted on handles and a parasol between them. The object of the plate was the gift of the village Tirukkattupalli to a temple of Siva built by Yajnabhatta in the sixth year of the reign of King Nandivarman III.7 The rich trading community also used the Sri-Lakshmi symbol in its grants and inscriptions e.g. In Melnangavaram village situated in Karur Dt., near Kannimar Temple, an inscription issued by Bhavarochaman belonging to Iynnuruvar, a trading community, is found. It belongs to the 10th century A.D. In a stone pillar Durga</page><page sequence="4">Historical Archaeology, Epigraphy, Numismatics &amp; Archives 1239 with four hands are carved, on the other side of the Pillar Lakshmi in Srivatsa Symbolic form is carved (Figure 8). She is flanked by two lamps. Below her the purpose of the inscription, dedication of a farm for the benefit of the trading community is written in Tamil and Grantha.8 In Kilakuruchi village of Tiruchi Dt. a rectangular pillar inscription of the 11- 12th century is found. It is 150 cm by 50 cm (figure 9). At the bottom of the pillar Puranakumbha , with lamps on both sides, above the sword, arrow and Dharmachakra , along with Damaru , plough and on top between two chauris an umbrella like Srivatsa symbol are carved. The object of the inscription was to exempt the village from all taxes and dedicate it to the Buddhist monastry.9 The coins of South India particularly those of the Paliavas, Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas depict only the emblem of their dynasties e.g., the bull and lion for Paliavas, bow for Cheras, fish for Pandyas and tiger for Cholas. These coins are not religious in character. Stangely three Sangam period Chola copper coins contain Srivatsa symbol on one side and tiger on the other. Srivatsa is mounted on an elephant with an umbrella and near it is a horse. On the reverse side is a tiger with wide open mouth and its right legs and tails are raised (figure 10). The coins are of various sizes and weights.10 The excavation at Kanchipuram have yielded eight lead coins datable to 5th and 6th century A.D. They have bull on one side and Srivatsa on the other." Like the Hindus, the Buddhist and the Jains have assigned to the Srivatsa an honoured place in their iconography like the wheel and svastika. This symbol was incorpated into their sculptures from other older symbols, i.e., Srivatsa along with Svastika mark in Kharavela's inscription of 2nd century B.C. (figure 11). The Srivatsa mark figures on the icons of the Tirthankaras of the Jaina pantheon, but here the mark is right in the middle of the chest and assumes the form of a four-petalled flower. Hemachandra describes Srivatsa as the banner (vis., distinguishing mark) of the Tirthankaras12 ( arhatam dhvajah'). Srivasta symbol occurs in the early Buddhist sculptures of Sanchi in association with triratna symbol (figure 12). At Amaravathi it is found as an auspicious architectural motif on window tops. During the archaeological excavation at Kaveripoompattinam, a Buddha foot carving with Srivatsa mark was found. At Kanchipuram Srivatsa symbol carved in bone is found.13 In Brahminical mythology Sri is said to reside in Visnu's chest and is depicted on the right chest of Visnu. In the Visnu images of the early Paliava period Srivatsa mark is absent on the chest of Visnu.</page><page sequence="5">1240 IHC : Proceedings , 61st ( Millennium ) Session, 2001 Instead we find Sri in sculptures and in panels in a semi-symbolic form. In the early Chola period the shape in which Sri is represented is like the figure found in Kaveripakkam. But the sculptural representation of Sri in Srivatsa symbolic form ceased after early Chola period. This could be due to the rise of Pancaratra Agama, with its rituals and the importance accorded to Sri-Lakshmi by the Vaisnava Acarya's Nathamuni, Yamunacharya and Ramanuja, which resulted in the rise of Sri-Lakshmi as a separate consort par excellence. The Srivatsa symbol gradually assumed a triangular shape and in Vijayanagar and later period images the triangle came to be accepted as representing the symbol of Srivatsa (Plate 1).
