(2) Notions of "reality" in early childhood are linked to experience rather than ontological status. (3) We have no good description of children's handling of fiction. (4) Cultural systems of religious representations make particular demands on developmental processes. INTRODUCTION One ought to be grateful to J. Woolley for giving us, not just a detailed survey of this literature, but a sus- tained argument about the theoretical and method- ological issues involved, as well as directions for fu- ture research. Without acting the spoiled child, I will suggest yet further conceptual distinctions, offer more speculation, and even suggest additional exper- imental studies. 1. The literature commonly considers children's reactions to counterintuitive events, on the one hand, and their attitudes toward fictional or imaginary or fantasy occurrences and characters on the other, as closely related manifestations of a general "reality- fantasy" distinction. Now these are different phe- nomena; although Woolley does not confuse them, lumping them together under the general "reality- fantasy" heading may lead us to overlook important differences between the cognitive processes involved as well as important features of each of them. I take it as (conceptually) obvious that the oppositions (1) be- tween events that conform to intuitive expectations and those that violate them, and (2) between real and unreal ones, are orthogonal. A course of events may be represented as imaginary, yet conform to intuitive expectations; conversely, counterintuitive events may be represented as real occurrences. That these distinctions are orthogonal is clear in children's pre- tend behavior and in their reactions to magicians' tricks. Many behaviors directed at imaginary items conform to intuitive causal principles: To pour pre- tend water into a pretend glass, children generally hold the pretend jug right above it, in accordance with intuitive physical expectations. Conversely, Johnson and Harris's (1994) participants readily apply the term "magic" to a particular range of oc- currences that are represented as both counterintu- itive and real. Their use of that particular label re- quires both features. Incidentally, the lexical labels (magic, magical) are confusing here, in that there may be no strong connection between such events and the (partly overlapping) domain of what is called "magic" in our culture. To speculate a little, we could probably produce the same effect (i.e., get children to mark off a particular class of events as special) even if the label was new or invented. This would show that from early childhood there is a conceptual slot, as it were, ready for the "counterintuitive + real," a point of great importance for the anthropological study of magic and religion (see below). 2. That counterintuitive events can be seen as "real" leads to another question that is partly ob- scured by the "fantasy-reality" frame. Perhaps the cognitive issues are more tractable if we use a finer- grained opposition between what is experienced and what is not. In this sense, it is misleading to say that magicians do not "really" take rabbits out of hats. Their performance is experienced as being just that, whatever reservations we (adults) may have about our own experience being illusory. For the child, (one aspect of) the lexical meaning of the term "real" may still be largely derived from "experienced." If this is the case, experimental protocols in which we ask chil- dren whether strange occurrences are "real" or not may be misleading for two reasons. One is that coun- terintuitive occurrences are real experiences (see above); the other one is that it is not clear how the opposite of "real" should be construed. It is often as- sumed that occurrences described as "not real" are construed as similar to fiction, so that when the child Commentary on Woolley, "Thinking about Fantasy: Are Children Fundamentally Different Thinkers and Believers from Adults?" ? 1997 by the Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.

This is not necessarily the case. This assimila- tion may be an artifact of the simplistic "reality- fantasy" opposition. At any rate, even if all nonreal occurrences were represented as fiction, this would not give us much purchase as concerns the cognitive processes involved, because we do not have a precise understanding of the child's way of handling fiction. Which leads me to: 3. Children often seem more liberal than adults in giving credence to fictive entities, fairy-tale charac- ters, or Santa Claus et al. Again, considering the issue in the frame of a "reality-fantasy" discussion may conceal interesting phenomena. The literature often works on the assumption that representing some agencies as fictional is a simple question of ontologi- cal status (i.e., deciding that they are "not for real"). But there is another, more difficult problem here. Un- derstanding fiction requires precise, mostly tacit hypotheses about which assumptions from common experience should be maintained and which should not in representing fictional events and inferring from them (see, e.g., Searle, 1979). There is no good understanding and very little experimental study of how this is actually done. It is a difficult question be- cause adults do not just follow what could be called a simple default-logic understanding of fiction; ac- cording to that principle, everything should remain the same (i.e., all assumptions and expectations about normal experience should be applied to the imagi- nary situation) except what is explicitly described as different. It is possible (this is speculation) that chil- dren are much more committed to a straightforward version of this "default" understanding than are adults. If they are, it should be obvious for them that, for example, Santa must brush his teeth or that the tooth fairy has a refrigerator. There is good (though mainly anecdotal) evidence that children often follow the default-logic principle, and are therefore more willing than adults to produce inferences and conjec- tures about fictional characters. This would lead us to think that they take those characters as "real," whereas it is only evidence for a slightly different handling of fiction. There is, however, little system- atic study of this process in either adults or children. 4. Woolley is quite right to compare children's fan- tastical thinking and thinking about fantasy, not to idealized versions of adult competence, as is too often the case, but to actual experimental evidence. That a good developmental theory should include a precise description of the end-point may seem self-evident, yet it is striking how much developmental descrip- tions in this domain leave aside adult superstition and magical propensities. This is nowhere as damag- ing as in the psychology of religion. Although we have some studies of children's religious thinking, these are too often based on irrelevant comparisons with an ideal, "theological" version of what adults think. This is a domain where the kind of questions raised at the end of Woolley's survey could be profitably extended to the study of cultural represen- tations. For instance, religious ontologies generally include assumptions that violate intuitive expecta- tions: Agents like spirits have counterintuitive physi- cal features, gods have counterintuitive biological features, and so on. Despite some common anthropo- logical beliefs, it is quite clear that such representa- tions are counterintuitive to the people who hold them. They are salient precisely because they are counterintuitive and held as real, the precise combi- nation that Johnson and Harris's participants identify so easily. However, religious representations are not exhausted by such counterintuitive claims. They typ- ically activate a set of intuitive expectations as con- cerns those aspects of religious agencies that are not explicitly counterintuitive: So spirits, for instance, are tacitly given the kind of cognitive processes that our theory of mind expects from all intentional agents (Boyer, 1994a, 1994b). There is little experimental study of such processes, with the remarkable excep- tion of Barett and Keil (1996). Their experiments sug- gest that people both (1) hold an explicit concept of God that includes possession of counterintuitive cog- nitive powers (God can see everything, God can at- tend to everything at once) and (2) use a tacit concept of God that is more in keeping with intuitive expecta- tions (e.g., God actually attends to one thing after an- other). More generally, the evidence would suggest that (1) we cannot readily compare children's and adults' ideas about magic unless we have a good de- scription of the interaction between counterintui- tive representation (which provides salience) and in- tuitive assumptions (which drive inferences), and (2) the "fantasy-reality" opposition is, again, much too blunt a conceptual instrument to describe the cognitive processes involved. To sum up, Woolley's survey of the literature is very helpful as a detailed account of work done in the "reality-fantasy" frame. More important, it is so- phisticated enough to suggest several ways in which we could go beyond that simple and simplistic oppo- sition.
