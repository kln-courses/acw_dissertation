<plain_text><page sequence="1">Words and Music Introduction ROBERT VILAIN Amongst the various literary works that bear the title Words and Music, one film and one radio play suggest between them both the more straightforward and the more esoteric aesthetic possibilities offered by combining the two elements of their titles. The film, made in 1948, directed by Norman Taurog, and starring Mickey Rooney and Tom Drake, is a somewhat bowdlerized version of the collaboration between Lorenz Hart and Richard Rodgers, 'the words' and 'the music' respectively in a long-lasting partnership that produced nearly thirty musicals and hundreds of songs. It was a successful cooperation, aesthetically and commercially ('nine hits in ten tries', as one historian remarks1). However, the paradigm the film offers for the integration of light verse and melodious music is relatively simple: one partner writes the words, the other the music, and the two (the products, not necessarily the artists) interact in an essentially harmonious and mutually completing manner. This is not to condemn this mode of writing ? such a stance would fail to do justice to a whole series of critically respected partnerships from Gilbert and Sullivan to Hofmannsthal and Strauss2 ? and it is not intended as a snobbish comment on the relative merits of so-called 'high' and 'low' (or 'lower') art. It means only that the film does not begin to exhaust the potential ways in which the linguistic, or the textual, and the musical interact. Another work with that title, Samuel Beckett's play, first broadcast by the BBC in November 1962, gives a more challenging and altogether more troub ling insight into this potential. Here Words and Music are characters, the servants Joe and Bob, who are enjoined to entertain their frail and irritable old master, Croak, with joint illustrations of the concepts of 'Love', 'Age' and 'Face'. If we read Words and Music as in some sense allegorical of the creative act, with Croak as the artist, and Joe and Bob as the dual media in which he creates, then it is clear that these media are to some degree independent of their shaping spirit; they can ignore him and they exist when he is not present. Croak demands that they represent his chosen themes, but they 'have to stumble by roundabout ways to reach the desired epiphany', which reflects both 1 Geoffrey Holden Block, The Richard Rodgers Reader (Oxford, 2002), p. 4. 2 It also includes works in which both elements stem from the same pen, of course, such as No?l Coward's Words and Music, a musical from 1932 (in which 'Mad Dogs and Englishmen' first featured).

They are told 'be friends' by Croak,4 but argue and irritate each other most of the time, as the * dialogue' prompted by Croak's demand for the representation of 'Age' shows: CROAK: Bob. (Pause.) Age. (Pause. Violent thump of club.) Age! MUSIC: Rap of baton. Age music, soon interrupted by violent thump. CROAK: Together. (Pause. Thump.) Together! (Pause. Violent thump.) Together, dogs! MUSIC: Long la. WORDS: (Imploring.) No! (Violent thump.) (pp. 129-30) The dialogue is such that Bob answers Joe's verbal prompts with musical responses. Music's 'speeches' (in italics but without parentheses, to distinguish them from the stage directions) are Samuel Beckett's shorthand for actual music, which in the original production only was provided by his cousin, John Beckett. When Katharine Worth proposed a production in 1973, she approached John Beckett for permission to re-use his music but this was denied. Her score was written by Humphrey Searle; subsequent versions use music by Morton Feldman, written in 1986?87.5 The difficulty that a reader of the printed text will have in conceiving of the sounds suggested by Beckett's very laconic descriptions in Music's 'speeches' is thus compounded by the fact that there is not even an authorized score for musicians to interpret. The reader has virtually no idea what one half of the dialogue is, although this indeterminacy does not seem to be acknowledged by the text itself, which proposes 'humble muted adsum', 'Age music', 'suggestion for following', 'air', 'warm suggestion from above' or 'irrepressible burst of spreading and subsiding music' at various points. Worth notes how the author was not interested in meeting the new composer in 1973, which suggests that the actual music, as it would sound to an audience, was of little importance to him.6 'Music seems to be treated as if it will be and mean the same in any realisation ? as a pure idea, indivisible and unchanging in essence from one manifestation to another, or as "pure 3 Katharine Worth, 'Words for Music Perhaps', in Samuel Beckett and Music, ed. by Mary Bryden (Oxford, 1998), pp. 9-20 (p. 10). 4 Samuel Beckett, Words and Music, in Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London, 1984), pp. 125-34 (P- 127).

From the point of view of the history of words and music in Austria, the antagonistic situation staged in Beckett's play is strangely reminiscent ofthat in Richard Strauss's and Hugo von Hofmannst hal 's play-opera Ariadne auf Naxos, where Zerbinetta's troupe of actors is required by the Major Domo to perform simultaneously with the opera company's production of their mythologically inspired music-drama, such that the apparently incompatible are ultimately fused to the audience's aesthetic satisfaction. No such fusion emerges from Beckett's play. The relationship there between Words and Music is always uncertain or conflictual: Music's more confident outbursts are met with 'Peace!', 'No!' or 'Please!' from Words; the more tentative 'discreet suggestion[s]' have Words 'trying to sing', which implies failure or at least dissatisfaction. The play ends with Croak shuffling off into the distance, Words pleading for more music ? 'Again. [...] Again!' ? a pause, and then Words' emission of a 'deep sigh' (p. 134). Beckett apparently told Theodor Adorno that the play 'ends unequivocally with the victory of the music',8 but it is hard to reconcile such a judgement with the equivocations of the play itself, which are characteristic of Beckett's 'endless wandering to find an elusive home', as Catherine Laws puts it, and demonstrate 'a groping through language for a true expression of self and experience'. Words and Music, she suggests, *hold[s] out for the possibility of language finding, perhaps through the example of music, a way towards this point'.9 This is a more positive assessment than Jonathan Kalb's, who sees music in this play as 'confine[d] to a function very similar to that of a filmic signature score'.10 We are a long way from the confidence in the relationship of words and music that I suggested was implied emblematically by the 1948 film of that title. Beckett explicitly rejects that degree of confidence in terms that prefigure the contrast of the two works considered here. His Words and Music has been called 'the closest thing there is in the Beckett canon to an opera',11 but Beckett disliked both operas and the opera: 'By definition, opera is a hideous corruption of this most immaterial of all the arts: the words of a libretto are to the musical phrase that they particularise what the Vend?me Column, for example, is to the ideal perpendicular. From this point of view opera is less complete than vaudeville, which at least inaugurates the comedy of an exhaustive enumeration'.12 7 Laws, 'Music in Words and Music\ p. 279. 8 Quoted in Clas Zilliacus, Beckett and Broadcasting (?bo, 1976), p. 114; quoted in Jonathan Kalb, 'The Mediated Quixote: The Radio and Television Plays, and Film\ in The Cambridge Companion to Beckett, ed. by John Pilling (Cambridge, 1994)?

P- 92.</page><page sequence="4">4 Robert Vilain The conceptual axis that the juxtaposition of the 1948 film and the 1962 radio broadcast seeks to establish might be summarized as the tension between easy success and strained failure, or in reverse, and more suggestively, in lines from the fifth of Rilke's Duineser Elegien [Duino Elegies] conveying 4die uns?gliche Stelle, wo sich das reine Zuwenig | unbegreiflich verwandelt ? , umspringt | in jenes leere Zuviel' [the ineffable place where pure too-little is incomprehensibly transformed ? where it flips over into an empty too much].13 But these works also highlight the factor of control, the artist's (lack of) control over the medium, or media, in which s/he 'composes' ? in the extended sense of that word. The pole represented by the film implies a high degree of mutual control: the two parties concerned, 'the words' and 'the music', can expect to arrive at a satisfying reciprocity. The pole represented by the play suggests the opposite, that frustration and antagonism are the norm, such that meaning is generated by a failure straightforwardly to map the one onto the other. It is important to retain a sense that failure in this respect can also be a creative bonus, since it is all too tempting to see the interaction of words and music sentimentally as mysterious but ultimately of guaranteed significance. George Steiner has reflected at length on the subject, here in the context of translation: The composer who sets a text to music is engaged in the same sequence of intuitive and technical motions which obtain in translation proper. His initial trust in the significance of the verbal sign system is followed by interpretative appropriation, a 'transfer into' the musical matrix and, finally, the establishment of a new whole which neither devalues nor eclipses its linguistic source.14 This account presupposes a high degree of confidence in the controlling capacity of the composer and takes a good deal for granted. Discussing at first multiple musical settings of canonical poems by a variety of composers, Steiner asks: Has the composer read his poem accurately? Which individual syllables or words, which phrases or prosodie units, does he select for instrumental or vocal emphasis? Does this selection or its converse, the understatement of certain units, fairly enact the poet's intention (is Schubert right, in setting Schmidt von L?beck 's 'Der Wanderer', when he concentrates the whole meaning of the song on the word nicht in the last line, making the word come on a poignant appoggiatura over a strange chord of the sixth)? In what ways are Schumann's, Liszt's and Rubinstein's settings of Heine's 'Du bist wie eine Blume' successive but also divergent commentaries on a deceptively na?ve text? [...] There are numerous cases in which the composer simply misreads 13 Rainer Maria Rilke, Werke, Kommentierte Ausgabe, ed. by Manfed Engel et al., 5 vols (Frankfurt a. M. and Leipzig, 1996), 11, 216. 14 George Steiner, After Babel. Aspects of Language and Translation (Oxford, pbk. 1976), pp. 415-16.</page><page sequence="5">Introduction 5 his text. In all his six settings of Heine, Schubert misconstrues the poet's covert but mordant irony. Often the musician will tamper with the words, altering, omitting or 'improving' on the poem to suit his personal gloss or formal programme [...]. Mozart tacks on an extra verse to Goethe's 'Veilchen'; wishing to obtain a rise of a full octave on the word, Schubert elides the e in V?gelein in Goethe's 'Ueber allen Gipfeln'; in Schumann's opus 90, the composer alters Lenau's text, changing words, leaving out several, inserting some of his own (being the most verbally-perceptive [sic] of songwriters, Hugo Wolf almost never modifies the lyric). In musical translation, no less than in linguistic there are problems of surpassing. In both Die Sch?ne M?llerin and Die Winterreise, Schubert utterly transfigures the feeble poems of Wilhelm M?ller, making of them a searching statement on the griefs and doubts of human existence.15 The quotation could be continued, but is interrupted here both because its gist is already perfectly apparent and because this section ends with a series of references to Austrian poets and musicians and thus begins to lead neatly back to the theme of this volume. Leaving aside the problematic assumptions made by value-judgements such as 'accurately', 'fairly', 'misreads' and 'surpassing', the relationships of power and control that this rather traditional account of aspects of the interrelations of words and music presupposes are useful as a foil against which to judge the more ambitious and exciting accounts of this relationship that this volume offers. Some of the studies encompassed by this volume undertake the kind of analysis that Steiner adumbrates here ? that of one composer's settings of a particular poet's work ? albeit with rather more critical rigour. Others trace the ways in which a literary text is modified and adapted before and as it develops as one of the principal components of an opera. Several share new insights into the complex relationships of individual works with the literary and musical traditions out of which they emerge (or which they transform and renew) ? or set such works in the political contexts of their genesis or reception, often using a key historical moment, a turning-point or a 'snapshot', as the starting-point for a wide-ranging investigation. In some cases the words and the music are those of the same 'composer', the relationship here shedding light on the process of composition itself. Literary works are often scrutinized for the light they shed on a musician's creative processes, but the importance of music to writers ? as audiences, but also as amateur or even semi-professional practitioners ? is no less important as an investigative standpoint. The chronological range covered by the individual essays is more than two hundred years, from the Classical Enlightenment to the early twenty-first century. In his study of the Austrian national anthem that opens the volume, Andrew Barker single-handedly spans the same period, as he traces the shifting paths taken by the anthem's words and music as they were used at various times and in a multitude of different combinations as expressions of social, political 15 Ibid., pp. 416-17.</page><page sequence="6">6 Robert Vilain and patriotic identity, under both Empire and Republic. Haydn's tune for 'Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser' [God preserve our Emperor Francis] to words by Lorenz Leopold Haschka emerged during the Napoleonic wars. The need for an anthem seems to have been triggered by the recognition of the unifying role played by England's 'God Save the King', to another melody that has been 'recycled' in a variety of different, and often implicitly contradictory, national contexts (including Prussia and then most, but not all, of the united Germany until 1918). New words were sometimes substituted during the life time of Haydn's melody, and some of Austria's most distinguished writers, such as Adalbert Stifter, Franz Grillparzer and Hugo von Hofmannsthal, were approached for a definitive text. After the end of the First World War, other composers, too, had a shot at providing a lasting melody, but Haydn's was reinstated after the Anschluss in 1938, since it was, ironically, the one used for the infamous 'Deutschland, Deutschland, ?ber alles' [Germany, Germany, above all else], and indeed for the current German national anthem 'Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit' [Unity, laws and liberty]. The current Austrian anthem is sung to a tune attributed to Mozart, although the essay on Mozart in this volume approaches the relationship of words and music from an entirely different perspective. John Irving looks as Mozart's encounter with the renowned fortepiano maker Johann Andreas Stein in October 1777, which was documented in a compelling series of letters between Mozart and his father over the next few weeks. Stein's development of the escapement action provided the technical basis for a touch-sensitive instrument and thus a more sophisticated range of possibilities for dynamic, articulation, expression, register and texture, of which Mozart made full use in his sonatas KV284 and KV309. The letters chart father and son's excited realization of how important this was for Mozart's compositional potential, the texts both recording and anticipating the musical developments that Irving explores in detail, convincingly illustrating his claim that 'neither Mozart's words nor his music make full sense without the other'. In the first of two contributions on Czech opera, David Brodbeck 's study of the first Viennese performances of Bedfich Smetana's The Bartered Bride opens with a historical moment similarly rich with potential significance for European music, the eagerly anticipated (and politically sensitive) arrival in Vienna on 31 May 1892 of a train carrying members of the Czech National Theatre for a programme of five Czech operas as part of the Viennese Exhibition of Music and Theatre. Music here served to articulate the growing cultural independence of a Slavic component of the Habsburg Empire at a point when tensions between its German and Czech nationalities were coming to a head. Analysing the responses of the German liberal and nationalist press, Brodbeck documents the complexities and tensions that underlie the surprisingly warm reception of an ambitious and contentious repertoire. Some critics sought to deploy the German-speaking Mozart's relationship with Prague and Smetana's affinity for</page><page sequence="7">Introduction 7 Wagner as well as other musical rapprochements between the Germanic and the Slavic to explain the phenomenon of the first performance of The Bartered Bride in Czech, which one of them, alluding to the 'B?hmischer Ausgleich' [Bohemian Compromise] of 1890, described as a musical 'Ausgleichs-Abend' [evening of compromise]. Others by contrast stressed the uniquely Czech nature of Smetana's opera or chided the Germans for not defending their native musical tradition as vociferously as the Czech visitors supported theirs. A more extraordinary 'Ausgleich nach Noten' [musical compromise], which must be a hapax legomenon amongst the multifarious possible relationships of words and music, was a series of four performances of The Bartered Bride in German but with one performer singing in Czech! Unfortunately the musical model for harmony and healing was not to prove replicable on the streets of Prague. The closing of wounds is overtly the theme of the next essay in the volume. A decade and half after the premiere in Vienna of Smetana's Bartered Bride in German, another premiere, that of Schoenberg's Second String Quartet in F sharp minor, Op. 10, met with a markedly different response. Darla Crispin explores both the scandal prompted by this work ? whose third and fourth movements each set a poem, most unusually for a genre in which words habitually play no role at all ? and the relationship it embodies between Schoenberg's chamber music and the music dramas of Wagner. Crispin also draws some telling parallels between Schoenberg's hatred of what he felt to be many contemporaries' dishonest use of the language of music and Karl Kraus's campaign against an equivalent tendency to pervert the written word in journalism and literature. It was the words in this concert that prompted the most furious hostility, embodying as they did an empirical articulateness felt to be transgressive within a genre traditionally associated with the abstract. Superimposed on this tension is another that derives from Schoenberg's determination to use the strictness of variation form to control the inherent romantic emotionality and drama of the text he chose to set in the third movement, Stefan George's 'Litanei' [Litany], which itself displays intertextual links with the libretto of Wagner's Parsifal that parallel the musical referencing of Kundry's laughter at Christ on the cross in Schoenberg's setting of the word 'Liebe' [love] with a similarly 'deformed' octave leap. Furthermore, Crispin shows how the two poems by George, especially 'Entr?ckung' [Transport] in the fourth movement, actually have a commentating and explanatory function in relation to the music itself. Crispin's concluding paragraphs speculate eloquently on the implications the order of the last two movements (and of the texts they set) has for our understanding of Schoenberg's views on the theme of redemption in music, given their respective relationships with the antithetical pairing of Wagner's Parsifal and Tristan und Isolde. The importance of appreciating the response to Tristan articulated by Gustav Mahler's Lied von der Erde [Song of the Earth] provides the starting point for Andrew Deruchie's exploration of the treatment</page><page sequence="8">8 Robert Vilain of the theme of death in its last movement, 'Der Abschied* [The Farewell]. Deruchie challenges the traditional subjectivist view that this work enacts the process of an individual death (much less the composer's own, which his illness made more imminent) and proposes that it explores an alternative epistemology, an exotic, oriental and anti-subjectivist alternative to late-nineteenth-century attitudes to death, one mediated via the poetry that inspired the work, Hans Bethge's Die chinesische Fl?te [The Chinese Flute]. Deruchie offers a rich tour of the anthropological and cultural history of death in the nineteenth century that ranges from the ecstatic Wagnerian 'Liebestod' [love-death] on the stage to the less alluring medicalization and commercialization of death in what one might paradoxically call 'real life*. But it is the combination of the brutally real and the ideal that emerges from Rilke's novel Die Aufzeichnungen des Malte Laurids Brigge [The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge], his conception of the mutual relationship of life and death in a form of 'Doppelbereich' [double realm], that provides the closest link to Mahler's 'Der Abschied' and the Taoist background mediated, albeit tenuously, via Bethge's reworkings of German translations of French paraphrases of Chinese originals. Deruchie concludes by exploring in detail how the music and the textual narration of the finale to Das Lied interdependently work through the Taoist solution in grammar, texture and gesture, moving from being 'drama of to discourse on death'. Mahler's Lied von der Erde is perhaps the first song-cycle with ambitions towards being a symphony (in ways distinct from, for example, Hector Berlioz's Les Nuits d'?t? [Summer Nights] or Richard Wagner's Wesendonck-Lieder), and as such it is an important landmark in the otherwise shifting terrain of the relationship of words and music. It was begun in 1908, the same year in which Arthur Schnitzler's novel Der Weg ins Freie [The Road into the Open] was completed and published. Mahler's work is the product of a series of personal crises (his resignation as the principal conductor at the Opera House, his daughter's death and the diagnosis of his own serious heart condition). As Felix Tweraser points out in the opening paragraph of his essay, Schnitzler's novel depicts a whole culture in crisis. Mahler's resignation from the Opera House was partly prompted by the anti-Semitism he encountered, a phenomenon that forms one of the main themes of Der Weg ins Freie, whose principal character, Georg von Wergenthin, attends a performance of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde conducted by Mahler. Tweraser presents a reading of the novel's d?mystification of social constructions including, but not limited to, those affecting the Jewish population of Austria in the early twentieth century, that draws out the extent to which music is not only thematized (Wergenthin is a composer and conductor) but pervades both its structural and conceptual architecture. The latter emerges most elaborately in the musical theories of one of Wergenthin's most important interlocutors, the Zionist Leo Golowski, who exposes the sentimentality and self-indulgence of his friend's music and thereby of his politics and ethics.</page><page sequence="9">Introduction 9 1908 was also the year in which Schlo? Nornepygge [Nornepygge Castle] was published, a hugely successful first novel by Max Brod, who would later become an influential champion of the operas of Leos Jan?cek. The uneasy relationship between German and Czech explored by David Brodbeck in the context of the performance of late-nineteenth-century opera in Vienna manifests itself on a different plane in Geoffrey Chew's investigation of Max Brod's 'Umdichtung' of Jan?cek's opera The Cunning Little Vixen, which was completed in 1923. The origins of the story lie in a series of drawings of animals by Stanislav Lolek and texts provided by Rudolf Tesnohlidek when they were serialized in a Brno newspaper before being drawn together into a novel, where they acquired a satirical-political dimension, and thence into the opera, where they represent a broader vision of humanity without in a narrow sense being allegorically anthropomorphic. Thus the material undergoes an unusually varied trajectory from the entirely wordless images, via Tesnohlidek's expanded narrative, into a pared-down verbal partnership with Janacek's music. Chew shows how the text is defamiliarized in various ways and how the music takes on the narrative function. Brod's attempts to intervene when shown the work in 1923 demonstrate his failure to grasp the full extent of Jan?cek 's originality in the handling of the text?music relationship, as does the freedom he proposed to exercise when translating it in 1925, rendering the animal-human relationships mutually symbolic in a more overt and less sophisticated way. Chew argues that Brod's version reflects concerns he developed in his own work on religion and cultural history at the expense of Jan?cek 's musical achievements, and that the tendency to use or study the German translation of the libretto rather than the Czech original similarly masks or even distorts Jan?cek's unique realignment of the relationship of words and music in the genre usually known as Literaturoper. Despite a certain chronological proximity, there is a considerable contrast between the delicately experimental animal world of The Cunning Little Vixen and the world inhabited by the poet Alfons Petzold, settings of whose socially aware, often highly politicized 'workers' poetry' by Erich Zeisl are the subject of Karin Wagner's essay, the only contribution to this volume that focuses directly on the tradition of the Lied, so important in Austria. Looking first at Zeisl's origins, his studies first with Out-and-out romantics' and then with more innovative, more Modernist teachers, Wagner argues that Zeisl's miniatures were intimately linked to the times and circumstances that inspired them and focuses on the period after 1931 (his 'Liederjahr' [year of songs]) when his choice of texts shifted away from works largely by Romantic or Neo Romantic authors. In 1932, against a background of increasing political unrest, Zeisl expressed his solidarity with the Social Democratic movement via his settings of four poems by Petzold. Adopting a musical style free of ornament and artifice ? at some remove from his Romantic origins, therefore ? Zeisl even sharpens the political focus of some of Petzold's poems by omitting their</page><page sequence="10">io Robert Vilain more redemptive elements or by setting up contrasts between more optimistic sounding passages of text and settings that emphasize the transience of hope. In 'Der tote Arbeiter' [The Dead Worker], for example, words and music both in different but cooperative ways establish a tension between the harsh world of labour and an optimism suggested by youthful purity, their subtle interrelationship itself a form of optimism that no longer obtains in the more overtly melancholy 'Komm s?sser Tod' [Come Sweet Death] that in January 1938 clearly anticipates the threat of National Socialism in Austria. The last two essays in this volume mark a shift to a much later period in Austria's history. The subject of Marton Marko's essay, Peter Handke, was born in 1942, four years after Zeisl left Austria, first for France and then for the United States, and nearly two decades after Petzold's death. And the music with which he became most familiar as a young man ? pop, rock, folk and blues ? is at some little remove from the tradition of the German Lied, opera, the concerto or the symphony, as is the jukebox that features in Der kurze Brief zum langen Abschied [Short Letter, Long Farewell] and in the long essay Versuch ?ber die Jukebox [Essay on the Jukebox]. It is tellingly alien to the world of the symphony orchestra, the chamber ensemble or the live accompanied voice that is inhabited by other essays in this volume. Marko argues that music functions in Handke's works, and for Handke personally, as the vehicle of moments of 'recurring epiphanic enchantment' that are desirable and necessary as antidotes to his intense experience of cultural and subjective fragmentation ? with the whistle of a steam boat in Der kurze Brief, for example, acting as the epicentre of a volcanic experience of music, myth and the collective. From his earliest works on ? including Publikumsbeschimpfung [Offending the Audience] ? the capacity of rhythm in music and language to impact on and change emotional states is systematically exploited, and Handke's texts contain performance guidance akin to that of a musical score (and not unlike Croak's structuring 'thumps' and pauses in Beckett's Words and Music). Marko uses the work of Roland Barthes and Walter Benjamin to suggest deeper affinities between the practice of music and the expanding concept of the text ? text and music are both 'composed', as Barthes points out ? in an era of mass culture and mechanically reproducible cultural products, in which both the authenticity of the work of art and its unique auratic character are under threat. In doing so, Marko returns to a question raised by a number of the other essays in this volume, that of the relationship of the modern to Romanticism, which is also the starting-point of the examination of Elfriede Jelinek's dramolet Rosamunde by Gillian Pye and Siobh?n Donovan. In a satisfyingly indirect way, this essay makes good what would otherwise have been a near incomprehensible lacuna in a volume on words and music in Austria, by acknowledging the presence of Franz Schubert in this tradition. Schubert's incidental music to Helmina von Ch?zy's drama Rosamunde has all but smothered the play itself ? and there is a further ironic refinement of the</page><page sequence="11">Introduction ii complexities of musico-verbal interrelation in the fact that Jelinek's play was written to 'accompany' a performance of Schubert's incidental music. His reworking of his own setting of 'Der Tod und das M?dchen' [Death and the Maiden] by Matthias Claudius as a string quartet is virtually a one-work definition of the term 'canonical'. That it provides the title for Jelinek 's much less obviously canonical quintet of dramas is an irony clearly intended by their author, who describes her Rosamunde as 'autobiographically' and 'parasitically' 'abusing' Ch?zy's original. Musically, too, Jelinek 's drama productively 'abuses' its Romantic intertexts, producing a cacophonous mix of discourses to enact the drowning out of the female voice by generations of male voices in a post-dramatic drama whose full realization requires its 'recipients' (actors and audience) to 'play' it as they might play music. In a sophisticated deployment of concepts developed by Barthes and modified by him in response to the work of Julia Kristeva, the 'pheno-song' and the 'geno-song', Pye and Donovan take the notion of the 'grain of the voice' as the starting-point for their analysis of Jelinek 's text as one that 'skirts the fringe of contact between words and music' and works with the 'friction' that their mutual engagement produces. The idea of virtuosity in musical performance is mapped onto the inability of the female voice to express itself in Jelinek 's Rosamunde where the 'geno-song' is allowed to emerge above the disrupted 'pheno-song', effectively parodying or debunking its Romantic intertext by 'playing it out of tune'. In accordance with the usual practice of Austrian Studies, German quotations are also given in English translation, usually by the authors of the respective contributions or by the editors. Titles of German works are translated upon their first appearance. Karin Wagner's essay was translated by Robert Vilain and Geoffrey Chew.</page></plain_text>
