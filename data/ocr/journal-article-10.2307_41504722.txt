Department of Art History ; Carleton University ; Ottawa The fifty-five bags in the Chandler/Pohrt collection of Great Lakes Indian art at the Detroit Institute of Arts are the products of one of the outstanding traditions of Native North American weaving. The technical sophistication of these bags has excited the interest of scholars for many years, while the rich variety of imagery they display continues to challenge our understanding. Twined (or finger-woven) bags were made by the Chippewa (also called the Ojibwa), Potawatomi, Winnebago, Menominee, and Sauk and Fox, as well as by a number of other Great Lakes and eastern Plains peoples. In the early decades of this century, sizeable collections of twined bags were acquired by major North American museums.1 The Chandler/Pohrt bags are an important addition to this body of material not only because of the out- standing quality of many examples but also because a number of the bags were found in their original contexts as containers for medicine bundles. A striking example is a Chippewa Panel Bag (figs. 3 and 4) collected at Cross Village, Michigan, in the late nineteenth century. It displays on its two sides bold, beautifully drawn images of the major Great Lakes Indian supernatural beings, Thunderbirds and Underwater Panthers. Although the making of twined bags seems to have died out among most Great Lakes peoples by the 1930s,2 eth- nographers working at the beginning of this century were still able to collect extensive information about the prepa- ration of materials and weaving tech- niques. Twined bags were made for a wide variety of purposes, from the hulling of corn to the storage of food, clothing, and sacred medicines. Mate- rials and techniques of construction naturally varied according to the use for which the container was intended.3 In comparison with our knowledge of technique, however, our ability to interpret the images woven into the bags is inadequate. This is surprising in that twined bags constitute one of the richest iconographie complexes in all of Great Lakes Indian art. Many early bags are adorned with beautifully rendered images of Thunderbirds and Under- water Panthers. Others bear depictions of deer, horses, dogs, turtles, and anthropomorphic figures, as well as a wide range of complex geometric pat- terns.4 So far, however, the complete repertory of representational and abstract geometric imagery on twined bags from the Great Lakes region has not been systematically studied. Several fundamental and fascinating iconographie problems arise when considering the Chandler/Pohrt collec- tion bags. Of central importance is the relationship between representational and abstract imagery in the oldest type of bag. As we shall see, a radical change in technique and design occurred in twined bags during the nineteenth cen- tury when the clearly recognizable images of spirit-beings, called manitos, were gradually replaced by a type of bag whose ornamentation was geometric and non-representational. In order to under- stand the significance of this stylistic and iconographie development, a rigorous visual analysis of the overall range of motifs on woven bags is needed. Fiber panel and banded woolen bags Before turning to an examination of these issues, it will be useful to establish a technical classification of twined bags, for iconographie problems are closely associated with overall developments in technique and form (see also Lurie, "Beaded Twined Bags of the Great Lakes Indians," pp. 38-45). Two types of twined bags, both of which were used to store personal belongings or individual Figure 2. Reverse of Panel Bag , figure 1. sacred medicines and medicine bundles, will be the focus of this paper. The older type of bag is generally regarded as an aboriginal form of container.5 It is made of vegetable fibers (usually nettle stalk), which were used for both warp and weft. The warps were hung over a rod and paired wefts were woven spirally around them, working from the top (the bottom of the finished bag) down. Wool made from moose or buffalo hair was added to the weft to form the motifs; later, raveled and re-dyed blanket wool was used. The result was a seamless container which could range in length from approximately ten to fifty centi- meters (four to twenty inches). The two faces of the bag were divided vertically into three compartments by striped vertical bands in colored wool. The large central rectangular panel contained single or multiple images which were nearly always different on the two sides. Representational and geometric designs occur on both early and later examples of this bag type, known as the fiber panel bag. 27</page><page sequence="3">Figure 3.

A dramatic change in the style and technique of twined bags may have begun as early as the mid-eighteenth century and seems to have been stimu- lated by the increasing supply of colored trade yarns.6 Although the weaving of fiber panel bags has continued into the twentieth century, the new type of banded woolen bag had become much more common by the late nineteenth century and was used for the same purposes as the earlier type. Not only were new trade materials adopted, but major changes in twining techniques, construction, and designs occurred.7 Banded woolen bags made after this time no longer display a large central rectangular panel, but are divided into three and sometimes four horizontal zones which are filled with repeated geometric motifs. A new technique, termed compact weft-twining, is employed that permits more frequent changes of motif and hue and results in a more richly colored and densely patterned surface. In compact weft- twining, paired weft elements twine around and hide the warps, making it possible for the weaver to vary color and motif by introducing new wefts where she chooses. This later type of bag no longer exhibits the bold, clear images of mythological beings that are to be found on many of the fiber panel bags. The geometric designs that replace these representa- tional images have not been closely analyzed, and they are usually alluded to as ornamental, decorative, and- by implication- devoid of symbolic mean- ing. Echoes of nineteenth-century cultural evolutionist theories can be heard in remarks which imply that representational imagery in the earlier 28</page><page sequence="4">bags later dissolved into fragmented, unreadable designs. Winnebago banded woolen bags, for example, are described as displaying "such degenerate geometric forms as to be unrecognizable." Similar Menominee geometric motifs have, on the other hand, been referred to as "purely aesthetic."8 In order to test these statements regarding the iconogra- phy of banded woolen bags, it is necessary to examine the relationship of abstract to representational design in the fiber panel bags that preceeded them. Upperworld images On a number of fiber panel bags one side bears a depiction of one or more Thunderbirds and the other side depicts single or grouped Underwater Panthers. According to traditional Great Lakes Indian cosmology, these two categories of manitos were the dominant spirits of the realms above and beneath the earth's surface into which the universe was divided. In the many accounts con- cerning the nature of these beings presented in the ethnographic literature, we find local beliefs and myths specific to particular clans or tribes, as well as a number of constant features attributed to the manitos by all peoples native to the Great Lakes region.9 The Thunderbirds were a class of spirits that resembled powerful predatory birds. The Ojibwa related them to hawks, while the Winnebago conceived of them as eagles.10 They were among the most popular and frequently repre- sented guardian spirits, in control "of almost all the power that men can imagine."11 Those who received visions of Thunderbirds were blessed with success in war and many other good things. The Thunderbirds were also associated with the rainfall necessary for successful cultivation. Lightning was said to be produced by the flashing of their eyes and thunder by the flapping of their wings. Many myths recount transformations of men into Thunder- birds and describe the manitos as organized into families analogous to the families of mankind. Images of Thunderbirds on twined bags depict many of these attributes and powers. Three fine bags in the Chandler/ Pohrt collection (figs. 3, 5, and 7) display the manitos adjacent to zigzag or jagged lines that represent lightning or thunderbolts. On each bag a large, fully described image is flanked by two or more smaller birds, a grouping that has been explained by some informants as representing "Thunderbirds and flocks of their young."12 Another interpreta- tion states that grouped Thunderbird images may symbolize a group of people bound together by ties of friendship13 or, presumably, kinship. These depictions of Thunderbirds also display a series of conventional stylizations. The body is shown as two triangles joined together to form a stylized hourglass shape. Indeed on two of the Chandler/Pohrt bags (figs. 1 and 5) the hourglass stylizations representing smaller Thunderbirds are reduced to minimal geometric forms whose meaning must be deduced from their context. Another common styliza- tion in images of Upperworld manitos is the internal elaboration of the triangular- and hourglass-shaped forms of the torso, which are filled in with concentric triangles, chevrons, or dia- monds. The central diamond or chevron in the upper torso depicts the heart in the "X-ray" manner common to images of spirits and power animals throughout the Great Lakes. The wings are normally shown as diagonal lines extending down from the torso and fringed with parallel lines representing feathers. Figure 5.

Underworld images If we turn to Underworld imagery, the dominant mythological being is known by a variety of names that are usually translated as Underwater Panther. This manito was represented as a powerful cat-like creature with horns, which may have been based on the lynx's projecting tufted ears. A long, dragon-like tail that frequently displays triangular "scales" 29</page><page sequence="5">Figure 7.

Reverse of Panel Bag , figure 7. elements of Christian cosmology in which the Underworld is a realm of evil and darkness. For the Great Lakes peoples, however, there is ample evi- dence that the underworld was also a source of constructive, creative powers in the form of medicines that could heal and prolong life. Various observers have noted that among the Chippewa "those who dreamed of water were usually the most successful in treating the sick."14 The attitude of Winnebago informants toward the water spirit was ambivalent: "he is evil, yet his 'bones' are the most prized possessions of man on account of the remarkable power with which they are endowed." The Winnebago regarded the water deity as partly good and partly evil, "always to be feared and capable of bestowing great blessings on man."15 Myths also record successful encounters with the Underwater Panthers in which great wealth in the form of pieces of copper from the animal's long tail came to those humans involved.16 Representations of Underwater Panthers are also highly stylized though perhaps to a slightly lesser degree than those of the Thunderbirds. The Chandler/Pohrt bags display the catlike bodies, horns, and long tails associated with this manito. The ribs or "bones," mentioned as highly valuable medicine, are clearly shown in all the examples (see figs. 2, 4, 6, and 8). One of the depictions also includes elongated hexagonal forms, identified as representing sacrifices of food in bark dishes, which were intended to "keep them (the manitos) contented."17 The long tail curving around the manito was termed by the Menominee "the Panther's road"18 and its coiled arrangement is probably related to the peculiar water phenomena associated with it. In the myth referred to above, in which two girls gain wealth by acquiring a piece of copper from the Panther's tail, whirlpool is the channel is shown coiled around the image (see figs. 2, 4, 6, and 8). Just as the Thunderbird was associated with storms in the skies, the Underwater Panther was associated with disturbances on water. Whirlpools and rough waters resulted from the swirling of its long tail, manifestations of cosmic forces that constituted serious dangers for people who traveled a great deal on lakes and rivers. Ethnographers have recorded many associations of danger with the Underwater Panther as well as the more generalized identifica- tion of the manito as an evil spirit. Despite these malevolent connections, there is good reason for caution in attributing such a moral dichotomy to the Upper/Underworld division of tradi- tional Great Lakes cosmology. The interpretations recorded during the past hundred years undoubtedly incorporate 30</page><page sequence="6">or path to the panther's presence: "in the center of the mud was a hole of clear water . . . the water was swirling around the hole, and as they started to cross it, a lion came out of the middle and switched his tail across the boat."19 Just as concentric chevrons or diamonds appear to be associated with depictions of the Thunderbird's torso and heart, concentric circles and concentric polygonal shapes appear to be associated , with the Underwater Panthers. This motif is prominent in a Potawatomi fiber Panel Bag (fig. 6). Two of the Chandler/Pohrt bags also display unusual iconographie features. The group of four Panthers on a Chippewa fiber Panel Bag (fig. 4) is clearly intended to represent two Panther families. Inside the bodies of the two females in the top row are small "baby" manitos, while their larger horns identify the lower two panthers as males. The representation of the Under- world manito on a Sauk and Fox fiber Panel Bag (fig. 8) has highly unusual branched deerlike horns, although the other iconographie features are those of the Underwater Panther. Images of Underwater Panthers, like Thunder- birds, are usually accompanied by zigzag, wavy, or castellated lines, which have been interpreted as representing the roiled waters these manitos create. One Menominee informant also identi- fied variants of the castellated line as representations of serpents, often thought to be the guardians and com- panions of the Panthers: "It is said that sorcerers sometimes had representations of horned serpents woven into the bags which contained their poisons."20 Bags like those we have been examining, which bear depictions of Thunderbirds and Underwater Panthers on opposite sides, may be regarded as a classic type of fiber panel bag. Occurring in all major collections and frequently large and finely made, they can be used as a baseline for interpreting the imagery of the genre as a whole. Such bags seem to constitute models displaying the arrange- ment of zones of power in the universe. Images are placed on the two sides of the bag, establishing a symbolic identity of one side with the Upper world and the other side with the Underworld. Con- tained between the two surfaces are power objects or medicines that are effective on the earth itself, which is located in the interface between the Upper- and Underworlds. Great Lakes mythology repeatedly expresses the opposition and enmity of the Thunder- birds and the Underwater beings. Yet, as we have seen, it would be inaccurate to interpret this opposition as a division between good and evil. The metaphor of positive and negative electric charges might be more useful, implying as it does a necessary complementarity in which two opposite poles of force must be properly aligned in order for a flow of energy to be established. The asym- metrical distribution of imagery on twined bags, in which top and bottom, over and under surfaces were differently marked, was perhaps a means of mimet- ically bringing opposing force fields into balance and neutralizing the destructive capabilities of each.21 Dreams and designs To understand this process more pre- cisely, it is necessary to look at the purpose of manito representations in Great Lakes art. Most discussions of spirit images in the art of this region stress that an image of a manito "is a prayer to gain the protection of these deities."22 The impetus for making such an image in beadwork, weaving, paint- ing, or sculpture came from a dream or vision. In earlier times images of dream guardians were woven by the Menomi- 31 Figure 9. Panel Bag , obverse, Winnebago (Wisconsin), 1860; wool and cord, 19 x 18 cm (7Уг x 7 l/l6 in.).

Reverse of Panel Bag , figure 11. nee into mats used to line the interiors of houses; in the twentieth century it has been reported that "the most common manner of weaving a dream representa- tion was in woven beadwork."23 Men who had such dreams would ask their wives to include certain motifs in the beadwork done for them.24 The images thus perceived and translated into works of art were not, however, merely decorations or marks of prestige. Stories are reláted of the transfer of special powers to the possessor of a dream representation. One informant's grandfather had received a Thunderbird vision and wore beaded garters with images of the manito. These garters conferred magical protection and when worn their owner "was imbued with the power of the birds they represented and was able to call lightning from the skies to strike his foes."25 The powers inherent in vision- derived imagery are thus comparable to those attributed to Plains Indian shield paintings. Indeed, Sauk and Fox inform- ants remarked on this analogy, claiming that their medicine bundles, many of which contained ornamented twined bags, were more powerful than the shields of their Plains neighbors.26 Other accounts describe the efficacy of objects painted with dream imagery in healing rituals.27 A story of a Winnebago man who wanted to receive a vision of Earthmaker (see note 15) also increases our understanding of dream representa- tions. The deity revealed itself as a flash of light and the making of an image was an immediate response: "Then Wegi'cika tried to draw a picture of the flash of light extending from the heavens to his camp, just as he had seen it, upon a cane. To that cane he sacrificed."28 Thus, the making of an image, the act of prayer through offering, and the reten- tion of the blessing are interrelated acts fundamental to the relationship between man and the powers of the cosmos. Geometric motifo It is significant for our discussion of artistic imagery that in the anecdote just cited the image of Earthmaker is described as a non-figural motif. Deities did not always manifest themselves as zoomorphic or anthropomorphic beings. Thus, dream representations could be either non-figural (geometric) or representational. According to one report, one complex dream repre- sentation painted on a man's blanket carried both representational and geometric motifs symbolizing the Thunderbird, lightning, and the earth. Although people in the community knew the subject of the dream, "the relation of these (images) to one another and to 32</page><page sequence="8">the dreamer remained a secret known only to himself and those to whom he revealed it." Representation of a dream thus "took the form of an object or an outline, and might be either an exact representation of an article or an outline more or less remotely suggesting a peculiarity of the dream."29 The semi- hidden meaning of motifs in Winnebago woven bags can be seen as "representa- tions of moods and feelings in the weaver's life," according to one observer. It also appears that "many of the woven bags have designs of the weavers9 inspirations during fasting in their first menses periods."30 All of this evidence leads to the conclu- sion that non-representational motifs in weaving, as in other Great Lakes artistic contexts, can be symbolic as well as decorative. If we return to the iconogra- phy of the fiber panel bags, we find that many of the older bags display abstract designs either on one or both sides. Beyond a general assertion that these non-representational designs can be seen as an "interpretation" of a phenomenon perceived in a dream rather than an "imitation," can we penetrate any further their private meanings? Six additional fiber panel bags, not illustrated here, in the Chandler/Pohrt collection display Thunderbird images on one side and abstract patterns on the other. Most of these bags are small and form component parts of medicine bundles. Close examination of these bags shows a series of recurrent geometric patterns that are related to the representational motifs we have been discussing. In four examples in this group, parallel zigzag lines occur on the reverse side of each bag. On the other Thunderbird bags, hourglass shapes and patterns of concentric squares or polygons are seen on the reverse.31 Another bag (figs. 9 and 10) with two Panthers on one side also has a geo- metric pattern on the reverse composed of two rows of linked star forms termi- nating in hornlike projections. These apparently abstract shapes could represent the stylized serpents reputed to be the companions and guardians of the Underwater Panther. We have already observed the placing of geometric motifs similar to these adjacent to images of the Upper- and Underworld manitos in order to represent emanations of power. Manitos were understood to manifest themselves through aural phenomena, climatic dis- turbances, and as transformations of the natural landscape.32 The display of geometric motifs on one side of a twined bag bearing the image of the manito on the other would logically seem to repre- sent an alternative manifestation of the spirit's power perceived as waves of light, sound, or movement. On these smaller bags, then, abstract patterns appear to reinforce and extend the meaning of the explicit image. As containers for individual personal medicines or as component parts of larger bundles, they seem to express the power of a single dream experience rather than the broader ordering of cosmic forces suggested as an interpreta- tion of the "classic" fiber panel bag. The last group of fiber panel bags to be considered displays abstract designs on both sides. These designs are closely related to the geometricized, convention- alized stylizations of the manitos we have previously discussed. On a Chip- pewa fiber Panel Bag (figs. 11 and 12), the design on the obverse consists of concentric diamonds bordered by radi- ating patterns of chevrons. The pattern, sometimes termed a "spider-web design," closely resembles an enlargement of the central portion of a Thunderbird image Figure 13.

Reverse of Panel Bag , figure 13. -a "blow-up" of the heart and upper torso. The reverse of this bag with its waves of parallel zigzag lines evokes lightning or, alternatively, water. The contrasting geometric patterns on a Potawatomi fiber Panel Baß (figs. 13 and 14) also make use of motifs derived from fully representational manito depictions. The obverse displays an elongated ser- pentine form composed of lozenge and 33</page><page sequence="9">Figure 15. Banded Bag , obverse, Ojibwa (Wisconsin/ Minnesota), c. 1885; wool, 44.6 X 59.7 cm (17% X 23% in.). Founders Society Purchase (81.184). Figure 16. Reverse of Banded Bag , figure 15. triangle forms, an enlargement of the form found adjacent to one Underwater Panther depiction (see fig. 6). Additional undulating lines are placed on either side of the central form. The reverse of the bag exhibits a pattern of horizontal zigzag lines which could refer, as in the previous bag, either to lightning or to water. An important aspect of the overall composition of this and other entirely geometric fiber panel bags is the way in which the spatial orientations of the patterns pull in opposite directions when the two faces, or sides, are super- imposed. Just as the explicit imagery of bags with an Underwater Panther and a Thunderbird on opposite sides creates a conceptual equilibrium, bags with abstract designs frequently display patterns oriented at ninety-degree angles to each other on their two faces so that the layering of the patterns creates a stable, interlocking grid as seen on the Potawatomi example. Though visually separate, the two faces of the bag form a conceptual unity that is a matrix of positive and negative charges. So far we have confined our examination to the older type of fiber panel bag. If we now turn to the innovative banded woolen bags that came to replace the fiber panel type, we find that nearly all the geometric motifs they display are immediately identifiable with the design elements that compose images of the cosmic manitos. Hourglass forms occur frequently, as, for example, in a Chippewa Banded Bag (figs. 17 and 18), and would seem to be derived from the Thunder- bird torso stylizations we have examined. Another element of the Thunderbird image, the fringed diagonal line of the feathered wing, is one of the most common motifs seen on banded woolen bags (see figs. 15 and 18). Bands of parallel zigzag lines and lattices of diamonds (see fig. 16) are also frequently found and closely resemble the abstract designs on the older type of bag. Although the derivation of the geometric motifs on banded woolen bags from the older fiber panel bags is relatively easy to determine, there remains a funda- mental problem of interpretation. Are we to regard this late development in Great Lakes art as a shift from the symbolic to the "aesthetic," or to what has been called the "degenerate geo- metric?" We have already cited early twentieth-century ethnographic evidence that weavers found inspiration in their own visionary experiences and in those of their relatives. In addition, further evidence exists of the use of highly stylized and abstract geometric forms in other late nineteenth-century Great Lakes art that can be assumed to be related to dream experience. The Chandler/Pohrt collection contains three such objects that exemplify extreme stylizations verging on abstraction. An appliquéd Chippewa Drumstick Bag (fig. 19) has on one side a row of linked diamonds resembling the serpentine motif seen in the Potawatomi Panel Bag (fig. 13) and displayed on a number of banded woolen bags in other museum collections. Above this motif is a diamond enclosing a square, a motif associated with the earth and the four cardinal points of direction. On top is a figure reminiscent of stylizations of anthropomorphic spirits found on rock art. A second object that displays designs closely related to those on banded woolen bags is a Chippewa Awl (fig. 20) incised with three geometric motifs placed beneath a carved spirit face. A lightning/sky motif of vertically oriented parallel zigzag lines is placed at the top, an earth symbol of a diamond enclosing a cross is in the center, and 34</page><page sequence="10">horizontal parallel zigzags evocative of water and serpents are placed at the bottom.33 Finally, a pair of Potawatomi Mat Needles (fig. 21) provides evidence of a degree of stylization equivalent to that seen on late woven bags. The carved forms of the needles suggest representa- tions of manitos. The wavy contour of one form recalls serpentine imagery, while the notched triangle of the other may derive from a partial contour of the Thunderbird torso, which commonly includes an edging of small triangles along one side, or from a Panther head similar to the representation on the Ottawa Panel Bag (fig. 2). The drumstick, the awl, and the mat needles seem to display a private and personal form of symbolic imagery. These three objects are tools whose efficacy can be extended through the blessings of the spirits. Indeed, all three present stylized images of spirits juxta- posed with geometric designs, providing further evidence that such motifs are symbolic rather than decorative. In all three cases a vertical stacking of the geometric motifs occurs that parallels the way in which bands of related geo- metric motifs are stacked on the late- period banded woolen bags. Although the contrasted patterns are still seen on the two sides of these later bags in approximately half the examples examined, a new kind of spatial zoning has been introduced in the horizontal division of the bag face. We might think of this change in terms of a shift from a three-dimensional model of the cosmos to a two-dimensional map. The classic fiber panel bags, we have suggested, replicated the structure of Upperworld/ earth surface/Underworld as obverse/ contents/reverse. The banded woolen bags appear to present a more idiosyn- cratic and personal charting of zones of spirit power on the two-dimensional surfaces of the individual bag face. Figure 17.

The changes that occurred in the design of woven bags during the nineteenth century were closely paralleled by changes in other forms of art. The shift from a combination of unambiguous representational imagery and geometric design to esoteric abstract patterning that occurred in woven bags also took place, for example, in shoulder bags from the Great Lakes. The quill-embroidered hide bags of the late eighteenth century with their clear images of Thunderbirds and Panthers were replaced by the geometric and floral motifs of beaded bandolier bags. In these bags, too, there may be a greater weight of symbolic intention than is usually assumed.34 It seems highly unlikely that the expressive meaning of Great Lakes Indian art could have changed so totally and so suddenly under the stimulus of new materials and stylistic approaches when we know that traditional religious ideas and cosmology were still retained. Rather, visual analy- sis suggests that an ancient repertory of geometric motifs, which had long been used to communicate the immaterial manifestations of the manitos, continued to be employed. Although the syntax changed, the vocabulary remained intel- ligible. During the nineteenth century, in the medium of twined bags, Great Lakes Indian artists continued to find in dreams the ancient designs of cosmic power. Notes 1.

The earliest extant examples of fiber panel bags probably date to the mid-eighteenth century. Three bags now in the National Museum of Ireland, Dublin (1902.327, 1902.328, and 1902.329), may be the earliest documented examples. They were collected between 1800-09 in the vicinity of Detroit and show signs of wear. Lyford states that "a well made bag would last a hundred years or more" (1943 [note 3]: 77), so that these bags could have been made as early as the mid-eighteenth century. Very few other examples occur in early European collections, although there are two in Vienna and two in the British Museum on loan from Stoneyhurst College, which were collected in the mid-nineteenth century. Whiteford points out that similar weaving techniques were in use as early as the first millenium in the Great Lakes region (1977a [note 3]: 36). 6. Whiteford's statement about the period when the change occurred in the Great Lakes is slightly unclear (1977b [note 3]: 40), and he does not cite his evidence for putting the origin of the banded woolen bags back to the mid-eighteenth century. I am not aware of any museum specimen that could be dated this early. 7. Whiteford 1977b (note 3): 40. 8. Carter 1933 (note 2): 45. On the Menominee, see Skinner 1921 (note 3): 257. 9.

Unlike the Chippewa, the Winnebago appear to have had a concept of a Supreme Creator, usually called Earthmaker, and did not make strict good- evil dichotomies. 16. V. Barnouw, Wisconsin Chippewa Myths and Tales and their Relation to Chippewa Life , Madison, Wisconsin, 1977: 132. G. Hammel finds the same "complementary, bilateral symmetries of Above and Below" in Iroquois mythology, in which the eagle symbolized the sky world and the serpent the Underworld ("Pieces of Dreams and Ancestors: The Tree and Serpent Motifs in Iroquois Culture," unpublished manuscript, n.d.). 17.

Castellated lines appear in association with Thunderbird images on the Sauk and Fox Panel Bag (fig. 7), where they could also be interpreted as the bottom half of a line of linked hourglass Thunderbird torsos. For a discussion of the intentional ambiguity of such imagery, see R. Phillips, "Zigzag and Spiral: The Interpretation of Geometric Design in Great Lakes Indian Costume," Papers of the Fifteenth Algonquian Conference , ed. W. Cowan, Carleton University, Ottawa, 1984. 21. T. Michelson notes that the myths of many Woodlands peoples narrate conflicts between Thunderbirds and water monsters in which the manitos ask and receive help from humans ("Contributions to Fox Ethnology - II," Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 95 [1930]: 55-56). These narratives also reflect three cosmic power "zones," sky-Thunderbirds/earth-man/Underworld- water spirits. 22. Skinner 1921 (note 3): 261. 23. Ibid.: 241; and Densmore 1929 (note 3): 82-83. 24.

The Chandler/Pohrt collection contains a twined Sauk and Fox Bag (81.531) displaying a juxtaposition of representational and geometric forms very similar to the blanket described by Densmore. 30. Carter 1933 (note 2): 45. 31. These bags are 81.392, 81.399, 81.433a, and 81.433b (parallel zigzags), 81.103 (hourglass forms), and 81.367 (concentric squares). 32. Hallowell 1976 (note 10): 370-372. 33. Radin identifies the cross as a symbol of Earthmaker in the context of the war bundle feasts and says that it is "unquestionably supposed to represent the four cardinal points" (1923 [note 11]: 28). 34.
