<plain_text><page sequence="1">Slaves and Livestock in Eighteenth-Century Jamaica: Vineyard Pen, I750-I75I Philip D. Morgan S LAVES and livestock were inextricably linked in the eighteenth-century British West Indies. As John Pinney, a Nevis planter, put it, "slaves and stock ... are the sinews of a plantation." In contrast to England, where land was of great value, a Caribbean estate, one attorney noted, was hardly worth the name unless "animated." The primary sources of animation were human and animal labor, indispensable both in the field and in the factory. Consequently, humans and animals were the most valuable-and highly vul- nerable-components of a plantation's movable equipment. For this reason, estate inventories consistently listed, first, the value of slaves and, second, that of livestock. Likewise, in describing the costs of establishing a Jamaican sugar plantation, Bryan Edwards, a late eighteenth-century historian of the British islands, succinctly labeled the most expensive item as "Stock," by which he meant both domestic animals and slaves. Because of their signal importance, these two forms of capital were usually grouped in precise grada- tions according to their productive capacity: from strongest to weakest, from first gang to children, from working stock to calves. As units of power, they were subject to constant evaluations of their effectiveness, persistent weigh- ings of their worth.' In the seventeenth century, Jamaica became known more for its livestock than for its slaves. Under the Spanish, Jamaica was an open-range ranching colony, with cattle, horses, and hogs running wild. After the British captured the island, settlers rounded up the remnants of the Spanish herds and built new, or commandeered old, cattle pens and hog crawls. The term "driver" originally meant one who caught wild horses and offered them for sale, and "maroon' was early applied to a hunter of wild cattle. In i67I, Cary Helyar, a knowledgeable planter, observed that there were "many ways to improve- ment . . . but a small stock of cattle is no bad beginning; here are good estates in that very thing mer[e]ly." The small capital requirements of ranch- Mr. Morgan is a member of the Department of History, Florida State University.

When Helyar made his observation, sugar planting, and the large influxes of slaves that it entailed, had already become the primary route to "improvement." Initially, large-scale sugar agri- culture grew at the expense of small ranching operations, because the num- ber of draft animals needed to power the sugar mills and provide the major means of overland transportation, as well as manure, milk, meat, and leather, led sugar planters to engross common lands and deny pasture to small farmers' livestock.2 Still, Jamaica was large and diversified enough to encourage small-scale ranching, particularly in areas unsuitable for sugar cultivation, and, more important, to allow the development of specialized pens linked to sugar plantations-the latter a unique phenomenon in the British West Indies. As Edward Long explained in I774, sugar estates in Jamaica had increased not, for the most part, at the expense of farms or pens. "It is more probable, that the augmentation of sugar-estates has been the means of increasing the num- ber of penns, by enlarging the demand for pasturage and stock." In Jamaica, slaves worked with livestock in three distinct settings-sugar plantations; small ranches or farms (termed "pens" or, more specifically, "grass-pens," in eighteenth-century parlance); and, most important of all, specialized pens (or "cattle-pens") that were often satellites of larger sugar complexes.3 These varied settings make it difficult to gauge how many slaves worked primarily with livestock at any point during the eighteenth century. The ear- liest calculations date from about I770. In that year perhaps I50,000 slaves labored on sugar plantations, another I7,000 on specialized pens, and I4,000 on ranches or small crop farms, with another 9,000 in towns. Nine percent of the i90,000 slaves lived on pens. Perhaps about 5 percent of the slaves on sugar plantations and farms worked solely or more than occasionally with livestock. In all, about 25,000 slaves or I3 percent of the island's enslaved population worked predominantly with livestock.4 2 Richard S.

Long advertised the Pedro's Cockpit district, lying between Clarendon and St. Ann's parishes, as a veritable Eden for pens. The pasture in this upland region, according to its booster, was so "wholesome and nourishing" that sheep "grow so fat upon it as almost to exceed credibility," and cattle and mules were "larger and finer than in most other parts of the island." Indeed, in I768 the two parishes contained about as many livestock as slaves, a good indication of penning's importance. They were outstripped, however, by St. Elizabeth's, the island's primary livestock-producing parish, which had almost I7,000 head of stock and a ratio of cattle to slaves, standing at I7 to I0, that was easily the highest of any parish. St. Elizabeth's specialized in livestock because it contained a large area of open, rolling, hilly country, together with large stretches of infertile, swampy lowlands, both of which were unsuitable for sugar production. In I790, William Beckford described the land in this southwestern corner of the island as "admirably adapted to the formation of pens, the best of which are certainly to be found in this parish."5 Located in this foremost livestock-producing parish, Vineyard was a repre- sentative mid-eighteenth-century pen. In I750, it employed forty-two slaves; six years later, Hertford Pen, in Westmoreland Parish (adjoining St. Elizabeth's), had forty-one. Between I756 and I776 the median Jamaican pen had a slave complement of forty-three. Vineyard measured I,172 acres; at mid-century, the average size of a Jamaican estate was I,045, and the I77 landholdings in St. Elizabeth's averaged I,237. Long was close to the mark when he reckoned the average pen at i,000 acres. Vineyard averaged 225 cat- tle during I750-I75I; six years later, Hertford Pen had 2I4 cattle, and in I759 one observer estimated that Jamaican cattle pens typically comprised about 250 cattle. Finally, Vineyard Pen, like many others, was part of a large plan- tation complex. Its owner, Florentius Vassall, who gave his name to a species of grass imported into Jamaica, maintained two pens in St. Elizabeth's Parish (Vineyard and Island) as complements to his sugar estates (Greenwich, Friendship, and Sweet River) located in neighboring Westmoreland Parish. Vineyard was thus a satellite, operated by a manager, rather than an indepen- dently owned cattle ranch.6 L. Solow and Stanley L.

Located at the edge of the Great Morass, close to Black River, barely rising above sea level, it was a lowland, not the more usual upland, site. Further, Thomas Thistlewood, who was its overseer or pen keeper during I750-175i and whose diary provides the prism through which the pen can be viewed, had idiosyncracies. For one thing, no other overseer, so far as is known, kept such a detailed aide de me'moire. Nevertheless, Thistlewood opens a window onto the world of a stockpen that is typical in three important ways: the composition of its labor force and livestock, the work requirements of specialized slaves and field hands, and the social and cultural life of slaves, each of which will be studied in turn. In such pens as Vineyard, in contrast to sugar estates, the smaller size of the labor force, the greater variety and flexibility of work routines, the lighter workload, and the more open social atmosphere produced a distinc- tive, and on the whole more favorable, slave experience. Perhaps most notable were the extremely wide-ranging exchanges-both material and edu- cational-between manager and slaves. But these advantages should not be overestimated: pen slaves like slaves anywhere faced violence, illness, near starvation, and sexual exploitation. The degradation was not just physical but also mental, for the commingling of slaves and livestock encouraged the manager to think of his human and animal charges in similar ways and treat them as such. One final aim, therefore, must be to gain insight into the ways slaves and animals were joined in the minds of Anglo-Jamaicans. During I750-I75I, Vineyard's complement was overwhelmingly adult, mostly male, and declining in numbers. Of the forty-two slaves at the pen in July I750, twenty-four were male and eighteen female. Four to six of the males can be identified as boys old enough to work in the fields. Three of the females may have been girls. In short, at least four-fifths of Vineyard's slaves were adults, of whom about 55 percent were men, not a marked imbal- Jamaica and England, I744-I799," Jamaican Historical Review, IV (i964), 4I, and for the report- ing of his wider calculations, "The Wealth of Jamaica in the Eighteenth Century: A Rejoinder," Econ.

Forty-one slaves were in residence when Thistlewood arrived, for one man had run away. Captured about a month after Thistlewood took charge, the fugitive was soon sent to his owner at Westmoreland, never to return. Another slave man, a pen keeper, was soon transferred to Westmoreland, and over the year Vineyard lost two more slave men and two slave women in this way. One infant girl was born during the year. The work force numbered thirty-seven when Thistlewood relinquished control in July I75I.7 During Thistlewood's tenure, there were just two births and, even more notably, only one death. The death occurred two days after Thistlewood's arrival, when an infant daughter born to Hago, a creole, died. One month later, Dianah, a "Congo," gave birth to a daughter, Chrishea, who survived her first year. The low mortality of Vineyard slaves probably owed most to the pen's work regime, which was less taxing than that of sugar estates, but the slaves' age structure also played a part. Almost all Vineyard's slaves were either adolescents or young adults; only Mimber, Sambo, and Titus were, according to Thistlewood, "old." The virtual absence of deaths was particu- larly notable on Vineyard because such a large proportion of the slaves were recent African arrivals, all of whom seem to have survived their first year in Jamaica. "Seasoning" was less traumatic on a pen than on a sugar estate. Nevertheless, fifteen to eighteen women might have been expected to pro- duce more than two births in one year, particularly as contemporaries like Long noted that slaves on pens "have more children" than those on sugar estates. Such an expectation may have been undermined by the large propor- tion of African newcomers among the women.8 7 At one time or another, Thistlewood identified Chelsea, George, Quashe, and Sussex, all "New Negroes," as boys. All 4 worked in the fields. In April I75i Thistlewood distributed oznabrigs. Two yards went to the infant Chrishea, and 5 yards was the customary allocation for adults (although 8 got at least twice this amount). It might, therefore, be a reasonable assump- tion that any slave who received 4 yards was an adolescent. However, Sussex was the only one of the above 4 boys to receive 4 yards, along with Adam's Joe and Coffee. I assume, therefore, that about 4, but perhaps as many as 6, boys were on the pen at any one time. Among the females, Deborah, Juba, and Quasheba received 4 yards. All may well have been girls, but Deborah and Juba were old enough to have sex with Thistlewood. The slaves who left Vineyard during the course of the year were: Bank (a pen keeper, who was in Westmoreland July 24, I750), Beneba or Eve (a water carrier, who was not mentioned after Feb. 4, I75I, when she went "to wash in the sea," perhaps on her way to Westmoreland), George (an African newcomer, who was sent to Westmoreland Nov. 30, I750), Joan (a washerwoman, who was sent to Westmoreland on Nov. 22, I750), Robin (the runaway, who was sent to Westmoreland Aug. IO, I750), and Simon (a pen keeper, who was not mentioned after May IO, I75I, when he went to Mr. Markman's). 8 July 4, I750 (death of Hago's infant); Aug. 20, I750 (birth of Chrishea); Long, History of Jamaica, II, 437. It is conceivable that other children were born and were not noted, although I doubt that Thistlewood would fail to note a woman large with child. As for mortalities, all slaves are accounted for, except for those who left the pen. Thus the fate of George, a newly arrived African, is unknown after Nov. 30, I75o, but the I2 other recent African arrivals were alive at Vineyard when Thistlewood left the pen. See J. R. Ward, British West Indian Slavery, 1750-1834: The Process of Amelioration (Oxford, i988), I26. For the low mortality of slaves on livestock pens see Higman, Slave Population and Economy, 123-25. For births exceeding deaths on 7 large livestock pens in Westmoreland Parish in the early i9th century see Dunn, "'Dreadful Idlers' in the Cane Fields," i67.</page><page sequence="6">52 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY Africans predominated at Vineyard. In July I750, there were thirteen "New Negroes," each known by an African as well as an Anglo-Jamaican name. Eight were women. Another five women and five men were also Africans, some probably recent arrivals, since six were also known by Old and New World names. In short, almost three-quarters of the women and two-fifths of the men were African, and many of these were recent newcom- ers. The coastal origins of ten of the newly arrived African women at Vineyard roughly paralleled those of the larger slave trade to the island. The Gold Coast and Benin accounted for five of the ten slaves and half the larger trade, but Vineyard departed from the norm in having four slaves from Central Africa, a region that accounted for only about I4 percent of the trade. One man and two women at Vineyard were said to be creoles.9 Vineyard pen, on Thistlewood's arrival, contained 25I cattle, i6 horses, 86 sheep, 8o goats, io8 chickens, 23 turkeys, 2i ducks, and a few pigs. Thistlewood grouped these animals, like slaves, into categories determined by sex and age, although Vineyard, unlike other Jamaican plantations, made no distinction between foreign and creole stock. The livestock population was heavily female, and perhaps for this reason their numbers either held their own or increased modestly during the year. Thistlewood handed over fifty-one fewer cattle than he accepted, although births had exceeded deaths by six; the shortfall owed to his having dispatched fifty-seven more cattle than he had received, including eleven to a Kingston butcher. During I750-I75I, births exceeded deaths among horses by four, and the pen received more horses than it shipped out, so that Thistlewood almost dou- bled the number of horses and mules. The numbers of goats and sheep remained static, although in both cases births exceeded deaths-by twenty- seven among the former and fourteen among the latter, with the surplus largely being sent to Westmoreland. The one group of animals that did poorly was poultry; a fivefold decrease in their numbers occurred over the year. Thistlewood noted diseases among them, most particularly "yaws," a swelling or scab around the eyes and beak. Whites also noted yaws, a non- venereal variant of syphilis characterized by scarring and ulceration, among their slaves-an example of the conjunction of slave and animal in the white Jamaican mind.'0 9 The "New Negroe" women were Accubah, Betty, Chrishe, Cynthia, Deborah, Marina, Mary, and Wannicker; the men were Chelsea, Dublin, George, Quashe, and Sussex. The addi- tional 5 African women were Beneba or Eve, Dianah, Jenny, Phibbah, and Silvia; the men, Charles, Guy, Julius, Mingo (because he once told Thistlewood of "blood sucking bugs in negroe country"), and Simon. The creoles were Dick, Hago, and Juba (Adam's Joe, presumably the son of Adam, was probably also a creole, although this was never stated). The ethnic or regional origins of io African women were noted: 4 were "Congo" (Chrishe, Deborah, Dianah, and Marina), 3 "Coromantee" (Accubah, Betty and Mary), I "Ibo" (Silvia), I "Papah, from a country called Aladder" (Wannicker), and I "Bambarah Negroe, or what Coromantees call Crappah or Tenne dones [illegible], being brought into this country young" (Cynthia). For the coastal origins of slaves imported into Jamaica I726-I750 see Philip D. Curtin, The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (Madison, Wis., i969), i6o. 10 Thistlewood constantly took censuses of the livestock. For the most useful see July I5, 26, Oct. 5, I750, Jan. i, Feb. I2, Apr. i6, May 8, 25, June 24, July 3, 7, I751. He also reckoned up</page><page sequence="7">SLAVES AND LIVESTOCK IN JAMAICA 53 Like slaves, the cows and horses had names, which Thistlewood recorded. Cynric Williams, an early nineteenth-century traveler, claimed that Jamaican livestock had "as fine or finer names than the negroes themselves." The names of Vineyard's horses and cattle were mixed. On the one hand, some had positive names such as Beauty, Faithful Black, Happy, and Hope, or names deriving from favorite locations such as Banbury, Chesterfield, and Edinburgh, or popular classical names such as Jupiter, Lucrece, and Venus, or even, in one case, the name of a famous literary figure-Tom Jones. On the other hand, some cattle had pejorative names such as Big Belly, Brazenface, Deceitful, Dreadful, False Heart, Impudence, Mangoe Arse, and Monkey. More interesting, many of the names of horses and cattle were also found among slaves. Ten of the twenty-four male slaves and sixteen of the eighteen female slaves shared a name with the pen's livestock. There were Cudjoes and Cynthias, Quashes and Quashebas among both slaves and cat- tle. At Vineyard, the name pools of slaves and stock overlapped markedly. 1 " Whites more than likely assigned most of these livestock and slave names. It is hard to imagine the slaves giving names like Phillis and Nelly to mares, Basheba and Magpye to cows, Joseph and Portland to steers. Similarly, either Vassall himself or Thistlewood's predecessor as manager almost certainly named the recent African immigrants. Thus Cranke became Chelsea, Quamini Dublin, Odomah Mary, and so on. Perhaps the involvement of whites explains why some slaves with specialized positions-Dick the driver, Julius and Scipio the pen keepers, Adam the gardener, for instance-did not share their names with livestock. By refraining from assigning such names to animals, whites may well have been conferring prestige on some key slave men. Over time, slaves probably began to assume some of the responsibility for naming. Adam and Dianah may well have named their daughter Chrishea. Since slaves lived closest to and cared most for the animals, they may well have named some of them. African naming traditions probably account for cows with names like Run-to-logwood and Small-Neck and heifers with names like Young Grandy and Young Run Mad. The vast major- ity of livestock names, however, were fairly standard Anglo-American ones; additions and losses on July 7, I75I. For the mention of "yaws" see July 24, 28, Aug. 3, I4, Sept. S, 7, I750- For this disease's common application to poultry see Frederic G. Cassidy, Jamaica Talk: Three Hundred Years of the English Language in Jamaica (London, i96i), I04-05. Some of Thistlewood's descriptions of livestock are quite precise as to color, markings, age, and the like. In fact, more is known about the physical characteristics of the Vineyard livestock than the Vineyard slaves. For instance, the only slave for whom we know an age is Chrishea, the infant. 11 Williams, A Tour Through the Island ofJamaica. ., 2d ed. (London, i827), 202, quoted in Higman, Slave Population and Economy, i. Male names shared by slaves and cattle were Bank, Cesar, Coffee, Cudjoe, Guy, Mingo, Quashe, Roger, Sambo, and Simon. Female names shared by slaves and cattle were Accubah, Betty, Cynthia, Deborah, Eve (also known as Beneba, which was also a cow's name), Joan, Juba, Marina, Mary, Mimber, Phibbah, Quasheba, and Wannicker. Female names shared by slaves and horses were Dianah, Jenny, and Silvia. Vineyard's cattle were not named until they reached a certain age, usually close to I2 months old. Some slave infants in Jamaica died before they were named, but this was a matter of weeks not months.</page><page sequence="8">54 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY owner and managers no doubt did most of the naming, although slaves probably played a part.'2 Some Jamaican planters claimed that only dark-colored cattle, like simi- larly colored humans, could toil effectively under a hot sun. "Monk" Lewis, for instance, reported that "the only horned cattle said to be fit for Jamaica work, are those which have a great deal of black in them." Vineyard bears out this custom in part. Brown, particularly dark brown, was the predomi- nant color among this pen's cattle, with black, red, and brindle the other most notable colors. There was no difference in the colors of cattle put to the fattening pasture and those retained in the field: lighter colored cattle were not disproportionately designated for the butcher's knife. The colors of the Vineyard horses were more varied-bright bay, light brown, dun, grey, sorrel, and strawberry-though brown was again the most common color. Although the skin color of most slaves on Vineyard is not recorded, we know that three slaves with specialized posts-Dick the driver, Sambo the goatherd, and Hago a house slave-were either mulattoes or "yellow skinned," an indication that a light skin helped in the exemption from field labor at Vineyard, as at other Jamaican estates.13 Slaves were more than stock, as Jamaican planters sometimes reluctantly and always unwittingly acknowledged. But this did not stop planters from thinking about, and sometimes treating, their human chattels as such. The fact that people and animals worked closely together hardly discouraged such thinking. All the slaves on Vineyard worked in one way or another with livestock, some more closely than others. Five men, some bearing the title pen keeper, specialized in handling animals, particularly cattle. Perhaps the most notable feature of their working lives was the amount of time they spent away from Vineyard, ferrying livestock between pens and between pen and the home estate in Westmoreland. Julius spent the most days (145 in all, 39 percent of Thistlewood's whole tenure) away from the pen and Simon the least (II days, just 3 percent), with Scipio, Guy, and Charles falling between these extremes (ii6, 93, and 53 days respectively). One trip can stand as typical. In mid-February 1751, Julius, Scipio, and Simon shepherded twelve sheep to Westmoreland, returning four days later with flour, cloth, and twelve bills. These five pen keepers accounted for 83 percent of all working days spent away from the pen. Another eight slaves left the pen for one or more days on errands, often assisting the five; their collective days away amounted to 85, 12 Horse names are recorded on July 26, I750, and cattle names on June 24, 175I. 13 Matthew Gregory Lewis, Journal of a West India Proprietor (London, i834), I97, quoted in Higman, Slave Population and Economy, 2. See also Shepherd, "Pens and Pen-keepers in a Plantation Society," II2. Seventy-seven of 208 cattle, or 36%, were described as brown or dark brown. Another 83, or 40%, were red, black, or brindle. The other colors were lighter versions of the above and yellow, dun, and white. Ten of 29 horses, or 34%, were brown or dark brown. In addition, there were 3 black and 7 bay horses. Of the lighter colors, there were 2 bright bay, 2 dun, 2 grey, i light brown, i sorrel, and i strawberry. Dick's ancestry was mentioned on July I5, I750; Sambo's and Hago's color on July i, I75I.</page><page sequence="9">SLAVES AND LIVESTOCK IN JAMAICA 55 most of which were attributable to Dick the driver and Phibbah the house maid.14 Cattle were penned almost every day, at dusk, with more general pennings at inventory time. Thistlewood notes that "men and boys" penned the cattle, an indication that other slaves assisted the pen keepers and that this was a masculine task. Other activities included "cutting" or castrating young bulls; branding and earmarking young cattle; attending to the health of the cattle, such as bleeding those in the fattening pasture twice a year; assisting at births; and pulling cattle and horses out of swamps and rock holes. The abil- ities of the livestock handlers impressed Thistlewood, who was no mean herder himself, for his father and elder brother were graziers and in the 1740s he had spent a number of years in Lincolnshire learning animal husbandry. On one occasion, he described the pen keepers as "very expert at throwing a Rope to halter Cattle," and he even drew a diagram of their hand placements as they held the rope. Slaves may have provided Thsitlewood with the recipe for a cattle tonic-"a quart of their own [the cattle's] Blood, a handful of Salt in it, and about 1/4 of a pint of Semper Five juice" (sempervive, an aloe, well known for its medicinal properties). Perhaps they also informed him of the strategy for getting an animal to stand-"Bite his Tail or Chafe it between 2 sticks"-and then supplied him with a palliative if the cow's tail was twisted off.15 Thistlewood's mention of animal tails, important status symbols in West Africa, suggests possible African influences in Jamaican pastoralism. Africans invested horse and cattle tails with high value because they reflected the prestige attached to the ownership and use of livestock; they put tails to practical, decorative, and magical uses. That four of the five pen keepers at Vineyard were fairly recent immigrants supports the supposition of African influence, although it is not known whether these four were from the north- ern part of the Western Sudan where animal husbandry was widespread. If they were from southern savanna regions or from the forest belt, where pas- ture was limited and diseases such as trypanosomiasis were virulent, they were much less likely to have had close contact with livestock. Moreover, all Africans unquestionably encountered novelty in Jamaican ranching. Most 14 Julius, Simon, and Scipio were listed as pen keepers when Thistlewood arrived at the pen. Bank was another, but, after one trip to Westmoreland, he disappeared from Vineyard. Charles and Guy, though never designated pen keepers by Thistlewood, fulfilled the same functions as the other three (in fact, they traveled a lot together). The other slaves to make trips off Vineyard (with number of days in parentheses) were Dick (35), Phibbah (i8), Port Royal (I4), Adam's Joe (9), Quashe (5), Bank (2), Chelsea (I), and Coffee (I). 15 On most days Thistlewood reported "penning a drove of cattle at evening or night"; July 27, I750, Apr. 30, May 8, I75I (general penning); Oct. I, I750, Apr. 9, I5, May I, 2, I75I (penning by men and boys); Oct. 4, I750, and May 25, I75I (castration); Oct. 4, I750, Feb.

In addition, the sedentary quality of animal husbandry in Jamaica would be unfamiliar, for in West Africa transhumance was central to livestock rearing. In short, an African influence cannot be taken for granted, nor can it be dis- counted, for animal husbandry was, in Anthony G. Hopkins's words, "at least as old in West Africa as agriculture."'16 The five pen keepers performed some of the heavier manual jobs at Vineyard, as well as giving a hand in the fields. They cut down limes and lignum vitae, made fence posts, and weighed logwood. Guy and Simon occa- sionally went crabbing. Charles received a new bill, suggesting that he per- formed field labor. In March 1751, after ten days on the disabled list with an injured foot, Scipio went back "into the field again."'17 In addition to the cattlemen, Vineyard employed four shepherds and shepherdesses and one goatherd. Elderly or adolescent slaves usually occu- pied these posts. They kept Thistlewood closely informed of deaths and births: his diary has 143 such notations for sheep and 112 for goats. The loss of sheep particularly concerned Thistlewood. During his first month on the pen, he reminded the shepherds "constantly" of the heavy mortality and spoke of finding "abler, sharper" persons to keep an eye on the flock. In October, he gave old Mimber fifty lashes because a ewe went missing and also punished her adolescent assistants. In January 1751, he again threatened the shepherds. By the end of May, he demoted Adam's Joe to the field, not- ing that he had "enough sheepkeepers." Old Sambo appears to have man- aged the goats largely on his own, except for general pennings and their transportation off the pen. One time, fifteen goats were carried on the heads of slaves to a nearby barquadier (wharf), where they were put on a boat for Westmoreland. Sheep and goats were "cut," branded, and earmarked, which must have been the responsibility of their handlers. If Vineyard's shepherds were new Africans, they would have had a direct link to their homeland, for Jamaican sheep were largely of West African origin.18 Four slaves-Cesar, Mingo, Roger, and Tony-served as watchmen. Only occasionally, it would seem, did Thistlewood come into contact with them: 16 Hopkins, An Economic History of West Africa (New York, I973), 39-42, 72, 74; Robin Law, The Horse in West African History: The Role of the Horse in the Societies of Pre-Colonial West Africa (Oxford, i980), 76-77, I59-62. i68-69.

Watchmen probably lived rather solitary lives, although on one occasion two of them took a "most solemn oath" by drinking "gravewater" together. Their huts appear to have stood at the outer edges of the pen, for Mingo's adjoined a neighboring plantation's cane land and Roger's was in the northwestern corner. Much of the watchmen's time must have been spent guarding crops, but Thistlewood refers only once to this collective activity-when the watchmen set traps of hardwood spikes in the plantain walks, about a step apart, to deter intruders. The watchmen also monitored livestock, for on one occasion Thistlewood ordered Mingo to walk about the pen by the morass to watch for cattle that had fallen in-one of the few times that Thistlewood specifically mentioned an individual watchman's duties.19 Titus lived a solitary life similar to that of the watchmen-on one occa- sion, he was put to "watching the corn in Mingo's room"-but his primary role was to catch land crabs to be eaten by Thistlewood or sent to Westmoreland. Titus also worked on his own account, for Thistlewood bought additional crabs: twice he paid for a dozen and once exchanged a bottle of rum for a dozen and a half. On one occasion, Thistlewood faulted Titus's productivity when he brought home only fifteen crabs over three days. In all, Titus spent at least fifty-one working days crabbing. He also repaired stock houses, sheep and goat pens, fences, and a storehouse; made chicken coops, posts, poultry baskets, and a water trough; and gathered wild cinnamon bark and logwood seed. These jobs accounted for another twenty- eight working days. Titus's independent lifestyle is confirmed by evidence that he "frequently" sat and ate by runaway Robin's fire when supposedly out catching crabs. Titus had another reason to spend time away from Vineyard: his wife, Tomassee, lived on a neighboring estate.20 Perhaps the most independent, and certainly the most powerful, slave man at Vineyard was Dick, the mulatto driver. His responsibilities were consider- able. The most important was to discipline the slave labor force. In Thistlewood's first month, Dick helped seize a runaway; a few months later, he captured another. In Thistlewood's absence, Dick took command of the pen. He distributed tools to the field workers and presumably supervised their labor. He also kept an eye on livestock. Once he showed Thistlewood the head and bones of a young horse and told him that he thought it had 19 Nov. 2I, I750 (gun and powder); Dec. 5, I750 (mats and baskets); Feb. 2, I751 (cabbage); Aug. 5, I2, i6-31, Sept.

At other times, he helped ferry livestock to and from Westmoreland. He also supervised wood- cutting expeditions.21 Dick's relations with Thistlewood attest to his relatively independent and elevated status. It is possible to argue thus despite the brutal whipping-300 lashes, easily the most severe punishment administered during Thistlewood's stay-that Dick received just a fortnight after the manager's arrival. Florentius Vassall must have ordered this punishment, perhaps to bolster the authority of his new manager, because he arrived at Vineyard a few days before the dramatic show of force and left the following day. This public humiliation undoubtedly battered Dick psychically as well as physically, lay- ing him up for nine days, but this was a world where savagery was common- place and where the lashes meted out to sailors and soldiers often exceeded 1,000. Thereafter, Dick's relations with Thistlewood were always familiar; Dick was not punished again. When Thistlewood arrived at the pen, he reconnoitred his new surround- ings with Dick at his side. After two days, they caught snakes together. Two weeks after the whipping, Dick sent Thistlewood the hind quarter of a young wild boar that his dog had caught-the first, and by no means last, gift that Thistlewood received from his driver. Vassall had ordered this dog destroyed, but Thistlewood turned a blind eye, perhaps in part because of this gift offering. Dogs became something of a bond between the two men. Dick told Thistlewood how to make dogs faithful. Take the liver of a dead bitch, dry it, beat it to a powder, put a little of this in the dog's meat, and he will never "forsake" you. Thistlewood was amused enough by the names Dick gave to his dogs to record them: Gainst Me, Fair to my face, Help myself, Creold Woman, Good Women's Scarce, and Women want all. Although a creole, Dick here engaged in African naming, for dog names were more often expressions or proverbs than single words in West Africa. Dick accompanied Thistlewood on alligator hunts. As they returned from one expedition, Dick and two other slaves showed Thistlewood how to carry large numbers of turtles and mudfish on a pole-"very cleverly," noted the diarist. And when Thistlewood visited the mountains-a four-day, ioo-mile round trip-Dick was one of his three companions and guides. Along the way, Thistlewood and the three slaves ate meals together, slept in fear of runaways, saw traps that maroons set for wild hogs, and feasted on roasted plantains, yams, and herring at the house of a maroon, whose arms hung behind the door.22 21 July 31, Oct. 24, I750 (capture runaways); Feb. 5-8, I75I (in charge); Feb. 26, I75I (distrib- ute tools); I assume that Dick supervised a certain amount of field labor, though Thistlewood never mentions it; Aug. 4, Dec. 4, I750, Mar. 30, Apr. io, June 22-23, 175I (livestock); July I, 3, 175I (wood cutting). 22 July i6, I750 (300 lashes); July 7, I750 (killing snakes); July 31, I750 (wild boar); for other gifts see Oct. 23, Dec. 30, I750, Jan. 6, Apr. 22, I75I; Nov. 5, I750 (recipe for fidelity); June 26, 175I (names of dogs); Feb. 23, I75I (alligator hunting); Mar. 5-9 I75I (mountain trip).

Horrific as 300 lashes</page><page sequence="13">SLAVES AND LIVESTOCK IN JAMAICA 59 Dick's female equivalent was the house maid, Phibbah. With the assis- tance of one or two other women, she kept house for Thistlewood-clean- ing, washing, and cooking. He entrusted to her care items for distribution to the slaves: a dozen biscuits, sugar, bottles of rum, rice, and oatmeal. She minded his possessions: candles, wine, even the keys to important lockers and chests. She tended to sick slaves, dispensing sugar and rum. She also worked closely with animals-in her case, poultry. She "cut" capons, pur- chased cocks, and periodically received a hundred ears of corn for the fowls. Her most unusual employment was selling cloth. Via Thistlewood, Vassall forwarded many yards of garlits, check, cross bar, and other materials to Phibbah, who marketed them around the neighborhood at between 5 and 7 bits (at current exchange rates, 3 to 4 shillings local currency) per yard. Her customers were probably other slaves, but even Thistlewood bought cloth from her. The first consignment of cloth began arriving in late November, and Phibbah spent at least thirty days over the next seven months selling successive allotments. Some of her expeditions took her away from Vineyard for five or six nights at a stretch; Thistlewood provided her with a pass. In April 1751, she sent money back to her owner: it amounted to over ?21.23 Phibbah was able to make a little money on her own account. Her hus- band, Romulus, lived on a neighboring estate. Thistlewood mentions him when he came to cut thatch at Vineyard-a favor that suggests the privileged position of his wife. Phibbah not only sold cloth, pocketing some of the pro- ceeds no doubt, but also received payment for making and mending clothes. Thistlewood paid her at least 50 bits (about Li iis) to have trousers, shirts, caps, and a waistcoat either made or mended, as well as a number of coats and frocks made for his favorite slave woman. Phibbah also earned money from the poultry: Thistlewood bought eggs from her. She used her accumu- lated wealth to acquire property. Once she bought a sow and a boar from a slave man for cash. When the potatoes in her provision ground were stolen, Thistlewood had the two culprits whipped.24 A few other slaves worked in or near the house. Hago appears to have been the other primary house servant, helping Phibbah clean or wash, but Hago was sick during most of Thistlewood's last five months at Vineyard. In the fall of 1750, Joan, a washerwoman, and Juba assisted Phibbah, but both left in November-Joan to Westmoreland and Juba to field labor. In 1751, Phibbah seems to have managed largely on her own, with infrequent help from one or two women (Cynthia, Silvia, and Wannicker, for instance) were, floggings in the army were often 3 times, sometimes 5 times, as great.

One other slave who worked in the environs of the house was a gardener, Adam. Presumably, he watered the garden, an activity Thistlewood occasionally mentions. He may have assisted with the poultry, for one Saturday he sold forty eggs to Thistlewood for 5 bits.25 The rest of the slaves were field hands. This group was overwhelmingly African and predominantly female. Of the nineteen who worked in Vineyard's fields, sixteen were Africans. All of the "New Negroes" immedi- ately became field workers. Thirteen of the field laborers were women. Four of the six male field hands were boys. At Vineyard, as at other Jamaican estates, men monopolized specialized posts, and women were relegated to field labor. The employment patterns of men and women were diametrically opposed: three-quarters of the women were field hands while almost three- quarters of the men were not (see Table I).26 The laboring force was too small to divide into gangs. Some activities called for male labor-cutting fence posts, sawing wood, penning cattle- and temporary alignments along sex lines then occurred. But the predomi- nance of women among field slaves militated against such divisions. Thistlewood once mentioned nine women and girls hoeing corn. The small number of male field workers no doubt explains why Vassall let neighboring planters bring male gangs onto Vineyard to cut logwood.27 Some tasks on the pen were done daily. Almost every morning the slaves cut breadnut boughs or bastard (wild) cedar boughs and carried them back at noon and evening to spread in pastures and yards as cattle fodder. At noon and evening slaves usually carried grass and hogmeat (a vine), or less frequently plantain leaves and corn tops, back to the enclosure to feed the livestock. Grass carrying was so necessary that it sometimes invaded the slaves' sabbath. This activity was highly reminiscent of Africa, where small boys carried fodder to livestock and the cutting and fetching of grass "was 25 Nov. 26, 28, I750 (Hago). See also Jan. 22-24, Mar. 23-24, Apr. II, 24, I75I. Almost all other references to Hago simply state "about the house" or, from Feb.

They are deduced by subtracting the slaves with specialized roles, by noting those slaves who received bills and hoes, and by Thistlewood's occa- sional references to a slave returning to the field. The women are: Accubah (who received a new hoe on Dec. 20, I750), Betty, Chrishe (new bill, Feb. 4, I751), Cynthia (new bill, Mar. 3I, I751), Deborah, Dianah, Eve, Jenny, Juba, Marina (new hoe, Dec. 20, I750, and new bill, Apr. 2I, I751), Mary, Silvia, and Wannicker. The men and boys are: Chelsea (new bill, Jan. I2, I751), Coffee (bill, Dec. I7, I750, and new bill, Mar. IO, I75I), Dublin (new bill, Feb. I2, I751), Port Royal (new bill, Mar. 2, I751), Quashe (new bill, Jan. 25, I75I, and new hoe, June 25, I751), and Sussex. See note 7 for the names of boys. At his departure, Thistlewood counted 23 field Negroes. He included the pen keepers to arrive at this figure. 27 For penning cattle by men and boys see note Is.

I750 and Jan.-Mar. I75i Benjamin Banton of Catabo usually employed between I4-2I "hands" and 1-2 draft steers in cutting, chipping, and transporting logwood at Vineyard. Lewis Markman, with whom Vineyard had other dealings in I75I, visited the pen on June 3, I75I, with 7 men and from thenceforth had them cutting and chipping logwood and mahogany.

Grass carrying was not particularly onerous, for it was considered children's work in both Jamaica and Africa, but there was no respite from the monotony. One other year-round task was corn husking. Like the carrying of boughs and grass, it occurred at the close of day.28 Most of the other activities of field hands fell into two categories. First, there was crop work. The most important staple at Vineyard was corn, which was fed to both slaves and livestock. Corn was planted during more than half the year-in August and September and from January through May-and hoed and gathered throughout the rest of the year. Almost as important were the grasses (Guinea, Scotch, and sour) that field hands planted, hoed, picked, and fed to the livestock. At Vineyard, grass planting occurred twice a year-in September and March. From September to March, slaves planted vegetables, including cassada (cassava), long okra, potato slips, red peas (beans), and taya (coco root), and two fruits, plantains (eaten green as a veg- 28 From July I5, I750, to June 30, I75I, Vineyard slaves spent almost every working day and 22 Sundays carrying boughs, grass, and hogmeat back to fenced pastures and yards. For Africa see Law, Horse in West Africa, 73-76. Penning or driving livestock was the only other activity that approached these levels of frequency, and it too sometimes occurred on Sundays (ii times). Husking and shelling of corn took place 3 times in Aug., I4 times in Sept., once in Oct., 7 times in Jan., 8 times in Feb., I4 times in Mar., 4 times in Apr., and once in May.</page><page sequence="16">62 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY etable) and sweet-sops, as supplements to their diet. Finally, slaves planted pinguins as a live fence from September to December and logwood as a valu- able dyewood in June. The second major activity was pen maintenance. Slaves kept pastures free of bushes, fences and stock houses in good repair, and ditches and drains open for bringing water to the stock. Over the whole year, Vineyard's slaves spent about equal numbers of days on pen maintenance and crop work, with concentrations on one or other in certain months. Thus, in March, slaves spent ten days planting corn and grasses and seventeen getting posts and rails for fencing, removing bushes from pastures, and clearing an interval or path (see Figure I). Conversely, in October hoeing corn and planting cas- sada, potatoes, taya, and pinguins occupied twenty working days, leaving five for repairing fences and clearing pastures; significantly, most of the cutting and burning of bushes occurred at night.29 Work at Vineyard was less physically taxing than sugar cultivation. As David Barclay noted, "the labour on a Pen is much lighter than on a sugar plantation."30 Nor was stockpen labor heavily regimented and disciplined. To be sure, there were some activities, such as grass picking and penning cat- tle, that punctuated each day, but slaves rarely spent a whole week on any single task. Many slaves worked alone or in small groups, rather than in gangs. Vineyard supported no tradesmen, although working with livestock required numerous skills, and a majority of men and a fifth of the women escaped continuous field labor. At the same time, slaves holding some spe- cialized position often turned their hands to odd jobs, and a measure of flu- idity existed between specialized post and field labor. Variety and flexibility were the hallmarks of a pen's laboring patterns. In some ways, the work regime facilitated a more open social atmosphere than did that of a sugar estate. The brutality and impersonality of sugar cul- tivation were generally avoided where hard driving was unnecessary, slave numbers small, and relations with a manager face to face. Nevertheless, the relative advantages enjoyed by pen slaves should not be exaggerated. If never as savage as on a sugar estate, life for slaves was harsh on a livestock pen. Violence was common. Thistlewood recorded whipping twenty-three or just over half of the slaves. A few were troublemakers in his eyes: he whipped five slaves twice, and two slaves three times. Almost two-thirds of the men and nearly half of the women received a lashing. Thistlewood whipped most often for what he called slack and ineffective work. Although he did not always specify the number of lashes, when he did, they ranged from 50 to 300, with the most frequent being 50 and ioo. It is difficult to assess the full 29 I count 70 working days planting, hoeing, and gathering corn, another i8 days planting and hoeing grasses, and 23 days planting, weeding, and gathering other vegetables and fruits. Planting pinguins occupied 33 working days and planting logwood seed another 7 days. Overall, Vineyard slaves spent I44 days in pen maintenance and I55 days in crop work. 30 Barclay, An Account of the Emancipation of Slaves of Unity Valley Pen in Jamaica (Dorking, Eng., i825), I9.</page><page sequence="17">SLAVES AND LIVESTOCK IN JAMAICA 63 Working Days 22 20 15 10 Jul Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun 1750 1751 Pen Maintenance * Crop Work FIGURE I Days Spent on Pen Maintenance and Crop Work</page><page sequence="18">64 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY meaning of these actions, but the following observations seem warranted. First, corporal punishment was part of the fabric of eighteenth-century civil and military life. A whipping was not an unusual event but a regular occur- rence, certainly not a declaration of war on the master's part. Second, a whipping every eleven days suggests the ubiquity of the threat, even if such a rate was lower than the only other known estimate: from Bennett Barrow's nineteenth-century Louisiana plantation, where a slave was whipped every five days. Third, the harshness of a whipping depended on the instrument used and the vigor with which it was applied. That Dick could resume work nine days after receiving 300 lashes is probably a testament to more than his resilience. No other slave missed even a day's work after a whipping; in fact, Thistlewood sometimes notes their immediate return to work. Although Thistlewood punished often, most slaves received no more than one whip- ping and almost half escaped the lash during the year of his management.31 Despite his formidable powers, Thistlewood never rested secure. A field hand named Wannicker-a name implying, appropriately enough, fierce temper or toughness-told Thistlewood that, in her crossing from Africa, the slaves had agreed to rebel. The young children had brought the men knives, machetes, and other weapons, but these were discovered before the revolt could take place. Some eight months later, this same woman revealed that she was a "Papah"-from Dahomey, where the port of Popo was located-from a country called Allada, two days from the coast. She then told Thistlewood a story of cannibals in her native land. She had seen them boil men's flesh and heard that it was more sweet than hog's meat. Perhaps she liked to make buckra (white man) uneasy! Thistlewood personally encountered violence one month after his arrival on the pen, when he caught Duke, a slave from nearby Salt Spring plantation, gathering fruit. Duke pulled out a knife and threatened his would-be captor. Surprisingly, after overpowering Duke, Thistlewood's response was merely to write a letter to his overseer, asking him to punish the bondman-almost as if to be threat- 31 Whippings were administered 3 times to Titus and Mimber (the two older slaves); twice to Deborah, Joe, Juba, Marina, and Simon; once to Accubah, Charles, Chelsea, Coffee, Cynthia, Dick, George, Guy, Jenny, Mary, Port Royal, Quashe, Roger, Sambo, Scipio, and Sussex. Thistlewood specified the number of lashes on I4 occasions: 300 (I), I50 (2), IOO (5), and So (6). It is possible that Thistlewood failed to record all punishments. For infractions that normally merited a whipping but for which there is no record see July 22, I750 (Bank), Oct. 24, Nov. 23, I750 (George), Sept. 27, I75o (Joan), July 31, I750 (Robin), Mar. 30, I75I (Simon), and Sept. 2, I750 (Titus).i Again, my thanks to Richard Dunn for making me recheck my figures, but I believe he is in slight error in his "Servants and Slaves: The Recruitment and Employment of Labor," in Jack P.

A couple of months later, Thistlewood saw a slave from an adjoining estate strung up on a tree, with his head cut off. His crime? Drawing a knife on a white man.32 Tensions sometimes arose from within the slave community itself, often involving abuse of women by men. Two Africans-Simon and Silvia-quar- reled so violently that the latter was, in Thistlewood's words, "made to cut herself" by her antagonist. Thistlewood had to divide the provision ground allowed another two Africans, Charles and Mary, because they "can't agree, and he uses her very ill." Adam the gardener received candles, flour, salt pork, and rum to distribute to his African wife, Dianah, when she gave birth to their daughter. A few days later, Thistlewood personally supplied Dianah with food "so that she might not starve." Adam had neglected to provide for her. When Hago encountered runaway George, an African newcomer, in the slave provision ground at noon one day, he threatened Hago with a knife.33 Africans in particular found life at Vineyard harsh, even when it was not violent. One problem facing them, especially newcomers, was illness. Eight, or two-thirds, of the "New Negroes" spent part of 1750-1751 sick in bed. Some, like Chrishe and Wannicker, lost only a few work days; others, like Betty and Mary, were ill for almost forty days each. The eight collectively lost a recorded 135 work days through ill health. Eighty percent of the other Africans were sick, though they collectively lost only ninety-six work days. Among the other slaves (either creoles or those of unknown birthplace), only six of eighteen, or one-third, lost work days through sickness. Collectively, they lost 159 working days, but over half of these were the creole Hago's; she was sick for much of the period between late February and early July 1751. This five-month period was much the unhealthiest for all slaves.34 Since the African newcomers had no provisions in their own grounds, they also faced acute nutritional deficiencies. In his first month, Thistlewood pro- vided new arrivals with a salted herring a day and a quart of flour a week, together with an occasional six ears of corn to individual slaves, such as Dublin and Marina, who were "really in want." In early August, he noted that the newcomers "complain very much of hunger, not without reason," and he doled out more ears of corn. By mid-August, he had stepped up the allocation of flour to two quarts a week, although it sometimes fell short at one and a half quarts. In the early New Year, shad replaced herring for a 32 Oct. 3I, I750, and July i, iysI (Wannicker), and Cassidy and Le Page, eds., Dictionay of Jamaican English, 462; Aug. 4, I750 (Duke); Oct. 2, I750 (hanging). 33 Jan. 14, I75I (Simon and Silvia); May I3, I75I (Charles and Mary); Aug. 20, 22, 25, I750 (Adam and Dianah); Oct. 24, I750 (Hago and George). 34 Apparently, 4 of the "New Negroes" (Cynthia, Deborah, Dublin, and Marina) escaped ill- ness. I omit George from these calculations because he was a runaway for the few months he was on the pen. The two Africans who escaped sickness were Eve (who left the pen in the early new year) and Mingo. The 6 other sick slaves (two creoles, the others of unknown birthplace) were Coffee, Hago, Juba, Mimber, Port Royal, and Scipio. I omit Robin from these calculations because he left the pen in Aug. I750. Of course, I count only recorded days of sickness (includ- ing Sundays, if a slave was ill on the preceding Saturday and following Monday). Quite possi- bly, Thistlewood failed to record some slaves' illnesses if they were of short duration.</page><page sequence="20">66 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY while, and five or ten ears of corn every few days often substituted for the allocations of flour. Recent arrivals sometimes received spoiled food: plantains "about to rot," "a bit of bad salt beef," "a piece of salt pork spoiled with long keeping," and "some peas which the ants had almost eaten." The Africans were kept from starving after August, but their diet was hardly nourishing. Not surprisingly, they were involved in the two recorded thefts of corn at Vineyard. In September 1750, three of the four slave women caught stealing corn were newcomers; in May the following year, two "New Negroes" com- mitted the same act.35 Africans also formed a significant proportion of runaways. In all, there were eighteen attempts, involving eleven slaves. Of the eleven runaways, only five were Africans, but they managed twelve of the flights. George, an African boy, fled as many as five times before Thistlewood shipped him off the pen permanently; Sussex, another African boy, ran away three times. As a further indication of African restiveness, Accubah and Mary-two "New Negro" women-freed George after one of his unsuccessful flights. Most fugitives absented themselves for no more than a few days, returning of their own accord; this was particularly true of the Africans. The three slaves who each remained at large for three weeks or more seemed quite familiar with their surroundings: while absent, Robin committed many robberies and consorted with slaves; Titus had a wife on a neighboring estate where he probably hid; and Joan, who stayed out longer than anyone, returned "of her own accord." Joan and Juba were the only absentee women.36 Subject to illness and near starvation and unsuccessful in flight, African women were also especially vulnerable to Thistlewood's sexual advances. Thistlewood recorded fifty-nine acts of sex with thirteen partners, ten Africans and three creoles. Africans were less likely to have formed attach- ments among the slave men and were therefore Thistlewood's main targets. Refusing his attentions would no doubt have proved hazardous, resulting in increased work or lack of favors. Casual exploitation is suggested by the time and place of some of the encounters: almost a fifth occurred at a workplace or in the open air. On different days, Thistlewood had sex with Hago on the dresser in the wash-house at 3 P.M.; with Silvia, an Ibo, in the woods between the cornfield and the swamp at II A.M.; and Chrishe, a "Congo," near a rock hole at 2 P.M. It is not hard to imagine a single slave woman, working or walking alone, being easily imposed upon by the manager.37 35 July 3I, I750 (Dublin and Marina); Aug. 7, II, I750 (complaints); July i8, 2I, Sept. 2, I750, Feb. IO, I75i (spoiled food); Sept. I4, I750 (Cynthia, Deborah, and Jenny); May i6, 175I (Deborah and Sussex). From July-Oct. I75o Thistlewood received plantains (IOO-25O on 5 sepa- rate occasions) from Samuel Coulson, overseer at Island Plantation, presumably because of short rations at Vineyard. Although the newly arrived Africans were distributed among the houses of the older residents, they obviously did not share their food, nor is there any evidence that the newcomers worked on the plots of the slaves with whom they were lodged. 36 The runaways (with number of days absent in parentheses) were Joan (so), Robin (30), Titus (2I), Sussex (i5, 9, 8), Simon (8, I), Bank (6), Charles (5), George (3, 2, 2, I, I), Chelsea (I), Juba (I), and Tony (I). George's rescue occurred on Oct. I2, I750. Thistlewood assumed that Titus was with his wife, for he wrote to her overseer about him. Three runaways from other estates (Flora, Fortune, and Cesar) were captured at Vineyard. 37 Nov. 29, I750 (Hago); Dec. 5, I750 (Silvia); Feb. i8, I75I (Chrishe). The Africans with</page><page sequence="21">SLAVES AND LIVESTOCK IN JAMAICA 67 Despite the sexual exploitation, slave women were not entirely defenseless. Most of Thistlewood's activity took place not at the workplace or outside but in his own house, in slave houses, or even in the Great House. Presumably, he let it be known that he would welcome a visit from a particular slave. Marina, his favorite, once spurned his advances, at no apparent cost. Thistlewood recorded paying a Vineyard slave for sex-he gave her i bit-perhaps because she was the wife of another. On Sundays he had sex with women from neigh- boring estates. As they were less under his control, a measure of volition may have been involved. Single African women proved Thistlewood's easiest prey, and, in return, they may have used him for their own ends. Three recent immigrant women appear to have invited him into the houses in which they lodged: Betty, a "Coromantee," had sex with Thistlewood in Guy's house, once on a form, once on a bed in his parlor; Accubah, another "Coromantee," in Cesar's house; and Cynthia, a "Bambarah," in the parlor of Scipio's house.38 Marina or Waree, a "Congo," became Thistlewood's favorite and recipient of many small and large favors. On August 5, one month after assuming his post, Thistlewood had sex with her. She was the first slave woman he took to his bed, and she loosed a flood of sexual passion. Over the next four weeks, Thistlewood had sex with Marina twelve times: usually at night, once at noon; usually in his bed, occasionally in the house of Guy, another African; usually once a night, sometimes twice; and once when a creole house servant was pre- sent. During August, Thistlewood also had sex twice with Juba, a creole, and twice with Betty, the "Coromantee." On September 1, Thistlewood recorded his last sexual encounter with Marina for almost ten months, because she then moved in with him. He began showering her with small gifts, culminating in the construction of a two-roomed house, about eighteen by seven feet, espe- cially for her. On leaving Vineyard, Thistlewood asked the most trusted pen keeper, Julius, to take care of her.39 If sex was not only exploitation but also exchange-however asymmetri- cal-it was part of a larger transactional pattern at Vineyard. Thistlewood whom Thistlewood had sex (with number of contacts in parentheses) were Marina (14), Chrishe (I0), Betty (4), Accubah (4), Cynthia (I), Deborah (I), Dianah (I), Mary (I), Peggy (I), and Silvia (I). For every one of these women, Thistlewood noted ethnic origin and African name, presumably indicating that they were fairly recent arrivals. The creoles were Hago (i0), Juba (2), and Clarinda (I). 38 Aug. 2I, I750 (Marina's refusal); May 4, I75I (i-bit payment to Dianah); Feb. IO, I75I (Peggy, Ibo, from Fullerswood) June 9, I75I (Clarinda, creole, from Saltspring); Aug. I7, I750, June 24, I75I (Betty); May II, I75I (Accubah); Apr. i8, I75I (Cynthia). 39 Gifts to Marina, which Thistlewood began offering on Sept. i6, I750, included two old pairs of dungaree trousers, a new bordered coat and frock, a basket, a large wooden bowl, old penknife, pork and chickens, more clothing, a corn sieve, beads and black ribbon for a necklace, and a crab basket. Thistlewood also gave a slave tobacco for hoeing Marina's provision ground. In May I75i he began drawing up plans for the house, which was roughly half the size of Thistlewood's own abode. Dick thatched and wattled it for I bits (just over 6s.), and Charles finished off the walls for the same amount. Thistlewood himself put up a hanging book shelf and set up a bed made of mats bought from Cesar. There were a couple of sour notes: on Jan. I2 and Feb. I3, I751, Waree (Thistlewood reverted to her African name on both occasions) received a beating for "bad behavior." Thistlewood's obvious affection for Marina did not insulate her from punishment. If one assumes that Thistlewood maintained roughly the same sexual activity with Marina as in the first month (I2 sexual acts a month), although perhaps declining between March and June I75I (say I a month) when the number of his partners expanded, then</page><page sequence="22">68 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY constantly exchanged material items with the slaves. The most numerous were with Dick, Phibbah, and Marina; the first two were obviously important to the smooth running of the pen, and the last was his lover. Yet Thistlewood paid for services or bartered items with another fourteen slaves, some of whom held privileged positions, but four of whom were field hands. Altogether, he entered into transactions with 40 percent of the slaves on the pen. Typically, he rewarded them for small favors. For instance, Scipio, the pen keeper, gained i bit for guiding Thistlewood on his first trip to Lacovia, the local town; Joan exchanged pork for rum; Guy swapped six good crab- wood torches for a bottle of rum; and Mimber secured i bit for eight eggs. Thistlewood also gave gifts: a beef cask to Sambo for storing corn and an old pair of trousers to Chrishe. Slaves were equally generous: Hago brought Thistlewood a potato pudding at Christmas; Adam's Joe gave him a live hum- mingbird, Adam a live swallow; and Scotland, a neighboring slave, gave him a carved calabash water cup. One day Adam lent Thistlewood some sugar; the next day, Thistlewood punctiliously returned the loan.40 In part because of these transactions, slaves acquired small amounts of property. Those of highest status owned a few animals: Dick kept dogs, in part for hunting; Julius, Phibbah, and Simon owned hogs, as did Joan, one of whose was shot at by Thistlewood for being in the slaves' provision ground. Many slaves kept poultry. Only Phibbah, it would seem, owned larger stock, for her mare strayed onto a neighboring estate.41 Slaves had items to exchange because of their work in their provision grounds. In the fall of I75o, Thistlewood divided over 6oo plantain suckers among the slaves according to the size of each family; early the next year, he estimated that the slaves had about i,8oo plantain trees in their own grounds; in May I75I, at the division of a new ground, he calculated that each slave had at least ioo square feet, though some had more. In all, the slaves appear to have had two grounds amounting to fourteen acres-about a third of an acre each-which, by mid-eighteenth-century West Indian standards, was proba- bly above average. They worked in these grounds on public holidays Thistlewood engaged in about 170 sexual encounters during his year at Vineyard. Douglas Hall and Richard Dunn corrected me on a significant error that I made with respect to Thistlewood's relationship with Marina. I am grateful for their help. 40 For Dick, Marina, and Phibbah see above; Oct. 2, I750 (Scipio); Nov. 3, I750 (Joan); May I, I75I (Guy); Dec. 23, I750 (Mimber); Dec. 23, I750 (Sambo); Mar. 24, I75I (Chrishe); Dec. 26, I750 (Hago); Apr. 2, I75I (Adam's Joe); May I2, I75I (Adam); Jan. 27, I75I (Scotland); Jan. 23-24, I75I (Adam).

Such exchanges were not unique to livestock pens, but my impression, which I hope to document from Thistlewood's later experiences, is that they were more widespread than on sugar estates. 41 For Dick's dogs and Phibbah's hogs see above; July I9, 1750 (Julius); Aug. 6, I750 (Simon); Jan. 28, I75I (Joan); Joan also once gave Thistlewood pork (Nov. 3, I750), as did Adam (Sept. 20, I750), and pork was stolen from Tony's hut (Oct. 24, I750); Aug. 21, I750 (Phibbah's mare). In another pen, 8% of all adult slaves owned horses and cattle: Increase of Horses, Mares, Mules, Asses, &amp;ca on Bodles Pen from Jan.

Plantains were important, and so was corn: on the Sunday before Christmas Thistlewood noted that slaves were gathering their own corn planted in August. A corn-based diet, together with occasional meat supplements that came their way either licitly or illicitly (cowskin was a popular dish, made from hide boiled to a jelly, with yams, cocos, ochro, and other vegetables), may help explain the general fertility of stockpen slaves. But provision grounds were not always sufficient. In August and September I750, six men and five women- other than the newly arrived Africans-received occasional rations of a pint of flour and a herring, presumably because they were in dire need. Nevertheless, pen slaves had more time to supplement their diet than sugar estate slaves. To their predominantly vegetable diet, Vineyard slaves added fish, crabs, ducks, pork, the odd alligator, and grubs-"In Cotton Trees, mahogany trees, &amp;c. are a Kind of worms cald Machackow's [macaca], by Some Bagoobah's [buga- boo], Negroes fry them and Eat them, they are said to look extremely well when dress'd."43 Another indicator of the familiarity and mutuality of a pen-at least when compared to a sugar estate-is the way in which Vineyard's slaves educated their new manager. Thistlewood was a newcomer to the island and perhaps more than usually curious, but the intimacy of a pen facilitated communica- tion between manager and slaves. Dick and Phibbah were Thistlewood's pri- mary teachers. Dick passed on much local lore: he gave Thistlewood advice on shooting birds and on using "Negro peppers" to catch them; he told him, with a straight face no doubt, how to harden his hands if they were to blister with hard work-just piss on them; pumpkin eating subdues sexual desire, he solemnly averred. Dick had come to terms with modern technology: he had tips about how to use a smoothing iron and claimed that a musket ball would not penetrate a bladder held up loosely. He introduced Thistlewood to gungo (peas used in soups and frequently cooked with rice, often called Angola peas) and to mamee gum (a substance made from the fruit of the mamee apple tree, which slave doctors often used for chigoes). Phibbah gave Thistlewood his first taste of many local dishes: "o-corn" (perhaps oka) made from pea flour, fried with peppers, tum-tum made from flour of red peas and Indian corn, pounded into a paste, and asham made of parched corn, finely ground, and mixed with sugar. She recommended cures for sores and for irritated eyes (the latter pre- scription was the juice of pigeon pea leaves). Thistlewood witnessed Phibbah's 42 Oct. i6, I750 (division of plantains); Jan.

Phibbah once told Thistlewood a complicated "Coromantee" story about an old woman who refused to give any meat to her grandchild. The girl had to learn her grand- mother's name in order to get food. She asked everywhere and finally discov- ered the name-six African words that Thistlewood dutifully recorded-thereby avoiding starvation. But the grandmother uncovered the identity of the informant-a crab-and, in a rage, threw a calabash at it. In this way, the crab got its shell. Thistlewood thus recorded one of the first African animal fables in the New World.44 Almost all the slaves at one time or another took a hand at educating Thistlewood. They introduced him to a cornucopia of plants, animals, and foods: ca/alu, a stew made from the leaves of this green plant; kaya, probably cayenne pepper that Thistlewood ate for dinner in a beef stew; coustee, which he reports as the "Coromantee" name for Guinea corn and may be couscous; fuingee, a Central African word for which there were many other equivalents, such as pone, and for which Thistlewood also lists previously unknown terms such as bitte and moasher (perhaps mussa), all referring to corn or cassava meal boiled up thick to eat instead of bread; junjo, mushrooms; patu, the Twi word for owl; pindars, the Kongo term for ground nuts or peanuts; trawmawly, crabmeat cooked with lime juice and peppers; wangla, a Kongo word for the small oily seed, sesamum, used in cakes and broths. They acquainted him with their instruments and entertainments: drums made from gourds; banja or strum-strum or merrywong, a favored musical instrument; "Tabrabrah," a "Coromantee" dance involving a rope tied at one end; and an athletic game involving a stick, performed by "Congo" men. Perhaps slaves coined the sea- sonal terms that apparently were peculiar to St. Elizabeth's: "Great Spring" for the rainy season between July and September; "Year Corn" for the corn gathered at Christmas; "Crab Rain" for spring rains, associated with the nightly appearance of land crabs; and "Parakeet Corn" gathered in July, when parakeets were plentiful.45 In addition to the vegetables and foods already noted, the foundations of the Vineyard economy-the fodder and the livestock-represent a long his- tory of wide-ranging exchanges between whites and blacks. Vineyard livestock fed on European, American, and African plants-Dutch grass (Eleusine indica) from Holland; Scotch grass and Guinea grass (Panicum sp. and Panicum maximum) from Africa, the latter entering Jamaica in 1744 and spreading rapidly thereafter; and maize from aboriginal sources.

Thistlewood learned of duppy, the spirit of the dead, which he likened to the Yorkshire superstition of padfoots (or gob- lins). The scavenging bird John-Crow or carrion crow inspired fear. Hurt this bird and you would never be well. Glass bottles and wooden images were set in provision grounds to prevent thieving. A wax kernel in grain had to be struck three times by a knife heated in fire for it to waste away. It was bad luck to sweep a house at night. Burn pepper in your house to keep away snakes. Slaves also told Thistlewood stories. In "Papaw" country lived abarra who lured individuals to their death by imitating familiar voices. In "Coromantee" country resided a monster called cokroyamkou who carried off children in a mortar on its back. Once a boy escaped. The monster searched and eventually found his quarry up a tree. He proceeded to bare his red "arse" to the boy and engaged in a thousand comical antics to make the boy laugh and lose his grip. But the boy was cunning and instead threw down fruit. The monster gorged himself and died under the tree. An animal fable and monster story in one.47 Thistlewood learned much sexual lore from his slaves. Phibbah borrowed his razor to shave her belly and told him that both creole men and women often shaved their private parts. She also told him that women with sores ought not to have sex. Slave men spoke of a powder that if given to a desired woman would make her love you. Slave women who ate too much cane or drank too much bisange (perhaps a drink made from bissy or the kola nut, or more likely from cane juice) appeared as if they had just had sexual intercourse; for this misimpression, "many a Negro woman [received] a beating from their hus- bands." Young black men used hog's lard in order to enlarge their penises. Slave women would not have sex with a "stranger" while they were breastfeed- ing. To do so was tantamount to murder because the new man's nature would alter the mother's milk and her child would sicken and die. In Africa, Thistlewood discovered, little girls were not allowed to tickle their ears with a feather, for this would excite them and make them want men.48 The familiarity of the pen owed much to the isolation and lonely existence of its overseer who, despite his formal powers, depended on the slaves for fel- lowship, even for friendship. In some ways, the pen was a more insular place for the manager than for the slaves, even though he was free to leave the pen at will and received and wrote letters almost daily. After he had been at Vineyard 46 Long, History ofJamaica, I, 452-54; Thomas B.

A few months later, in early January I75I, he again mentioned a long interval without white people-almost three weeks. All through the Christmas celebrations-at which Thistlewood heard the distant firing of guns and the nearby playing of "Christian, Congo, and Coromantee music, drumming, and dancing"-he never left the pen, saw no whites, and mixed solely with slaves. During his year at Vineyard, he left the pen only twelve times. Most of these trips were morning or afternoon excur- sions to the local store at Black River (about five miles away) or to Lacovia (some ten miles distant). Only two trips were extended ones. In all, Thistlewood spent eight nights away from the pen. Sometimes an artisan, another overseer, or his employer and his associates dropped in for a day or so. More likely, slaves from other estates were the visitors. In fact, many more slaves, visited the pen than whites. Both within and outside Vineyard, Thistlewood lived in a predominantly black world.49 In sum, although Vineyard was full of tensions between men and women, between semiskilled workers and field hands, between creoles and Africans, and most signally between bondpeople and their free manager, it was also a place of education where black and white learned from one another, of recip- rocal giving and exchanging, of intimacy. The slaves' companionship even extended beyond Thistlewood's tenure at Vineyard. A year after his departure, Thistlewood met Dick the driver and caught up on news of the Vineyard slaves, and in March I753, Guy, his former pen keeper and trusted traveler, called on Thistlewood, who then lived about twenty miles away, to renew acquaintance. As these acts of friendship attest, slaves struggled daily to over- come their dehumanization. Their world consisted of sickness, near starva- tion, rape, and brutal punishment. But Vineyard slaves responded to these outrages by engaging in a remarkable drama of social exchange and cultural survival. They ran away, planted their own grounds, cooked their own dishes, learned about native plants, made music, danced, played games, told stories, carved calabash bowls, lived in families, and named things. They maintained their humanity under severe conditions.50 Perhaps the most illuminating insight into the slaves' robust social life and their relationship with their manager comes in how Thistlewood took his leave of them. On his last Saturday night, he supplied Marina with four bot- tles of rum, sugar, beef, _fungee, and pepperpot so that she could "treat" the slaves, in particular her "shipmates." The occasion was Marina's housewarm- I75I (effects of cane eating); May I1, I75I (hog's lard and breastfeeding taboo); May i6, I751 (effects of feather). 49 Aug. 6, I750 (doctor); Jan. 8, I75I (first white face since Dec. i9).

At this fes- tive event, he marveled at the "tip-top performances" of the slaves who "danced congo," sang, and drummed. Charles even swallowed fire and "stabbed his naked arm many times with the edge of a bill, very hard, yet received no harm." Everybody was "merry," and Marina, in particular, got very drunk. On Sunday morning Thistlewood distributed a pint of red peas to every slave as a special treat. He delivered the pen books, mosquito net, bed- ding, table cloth, and other household items into the custody of the trusted Phibbah, and gave Dick charge of the chest of carpentry tools. In the after- noon, he went around the pen taking his "Farewell" of his charges. There were more gifts: his old scarlet waistcoat to Coffee, a bottle of rum each to Phibbah and Adam. The lion's share went to Marina-thread, an old cap, two old handkerchiefs, a white shirt, two pairs of old trousers, a yard of cloth, a bas- ket, a tin roaster, wild cinnamon, wax light, a form, a little stool, a cupboard that he hung for her in her new house, a chest for her clothes, a barrel for her corn, a barrel of beef brine, a piece of beef, potatoes, three bottles of rum, sugar, and butter. On Monday morning he rose by moonlight, gave Marina one last bottle of rum and a water pail, and said his goodbyes to her in his par- lor, before leaving the pen for good. There remains only one detail to record: on that last Sunday Marina and Thistlewood had sex-the first time he had recorded such an intimacy since she had come to live with him ten months earlier.51 Slaves on Jamaican stockpens were slightly better off than those who labored on sugar estates, with their killing work regime and terrible mortality rates. The work itself was varied and flexible, and although opportunities for skilled labor were few, general labor required versatility and dexterity. Life there, as for slaves everywhere, could be violent, but the social climate tended to be less fraught than on a sugar estate. Human relationships seem less strained, less brutal, and less heartless. At the same time, the propensity to think of slaves as animals and to treat them as such was always present. On one occasion, Thistlewood described as "ugly" the slaves' practice of picking "lice off their heads, with their fingers, putting them in their mouth and eat- ing them." According to him, monkeys "had a parallel custom." This equation of slaves and monkeys had a long history. As news about Africa spread through Europe, the supposed association of blacks and apes exerted great fas- cination. Here is a glimpse of how blacks could descend, in a white mind, to the level of animals.52 This mode of thinking is best understood in the context of preindustrial peoples' relationship to animals. The early modern English generally assumed that the world had been created for humans and that other species were meant to be subordinate to their wishes and needs. Domestication was good for ani- mals; it civilized them and increased their numbers. Thus castration-prac- 51 July 6-8, I75'. 52 Apr. 20, I75I; Winthrop D.

To butcher domestic stock proved more a kindness than a cruelty, for their despatch was quick and they were spared the sufferings of old age. Killing for pleasure was equally justified by referring to human ascendancy. Thistlewood and the Vineyard slaves were avid hunters, who probably gave little thought to the spilling of animal blood. English culture generally emphasized the great gulf between man and beast. To behave in a "beastly" or "brutish" fashion was to give rein to animal impulses and to transgress a vital boundary. Furthermore, a people who were thought to live predominantly brutish lives would, there- fore, lack the essence of humanity. In their animal-like condition, they could be branded, bought and sold, chained, whipped, even castrated-just like stock. And possibly slaves, like the lower orders in general, if Mary Wollstonecraft can be believed, domineered over animals in order "to revenge the insults that they are obliged to bear from their superiors." Bryan Edwards claimed that Jamaican slaves' "treatment of cattle" was "brutal beyond belief." Furthermore, "[e]ven the useful and social qualities of the dog secure to him no kind usage from an African master. Although there is scarce a Negro that is not attended by one, they seem to maintain these poor animals solely for the purpose of having an object whereon to exercise their caprice and cruelty." In this way, slaves demonstrated to their superiors their alleged brutality.53 British West Indians usually compared slaves to domesticated, not wild, animals. It was common to note that slaves were purchased "like a herd of cat- tle" or as "Horses in a Market," although these similes hardly exhaust the range of animal analogies. Hans Sloane described slave women's breasts as "lank . . . like those of goats," and Richard Ligon wrote that slaves wrestled "like two Cocks, with heads as low as their hips." White Jamaicans referred to their livestock ranches as breeding pens and their slave women as breeding wenches. Like other whites, Thistlewood learned to inventory animals and slaves as "Stock," referred to livestock and slaves by the same names, and attributed a disease to both slaves and poultry. Although he does not say so, he more than likely thought that both dark-colored humans and animals were suited to field labor-such seems to have been the pattern at Vineyard. In these ways, he and other Jamaicans likened slaves to animals that could be curbed, tamed, kept docile, and domesticated. They were not generally likened to predators or to vermin, animals that needed to be eliminated. Significantly, when Thistlewood referred to Jamaican maroons, he termed them "the Wild Negroes," implicitly contrasting them with supposedly domesticated blacks. In I788, Hector McNeill stated the typical white Jamaican view of the black character: "A Negro has more idea of liberty good sir, than your horse. Both are equally disposed to roam at large without con- trol; and provided they have plenty to eat and drink, they will not come near 53 Keith Thomas, Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England, i5oo-i800 (London, i983), esp. chap. i, Wollstonecraft quotation on 50; Jordan, White over Black, 28, 33, 38, 54, II9, I55-56, I90, 228-34, 365; Edwards, History ... of the British West Indies, II, 95.</page><page sequence="29">SLAVES AND LIVESTOCK IN JAMAICA 75 you. Take however either, and break him in properly; accustom him to the bridle and occasionally to the whip; direct him to the road in which he is to go, . . . [and] he will soon (unless he is vicious) not only bear, but love the task he has to perform." The one wild animal to which slaves were often com- pared was the ape. This comparison was not made in order to suggest the slaves' wild, savage character, because apes were clearly the most humanlike of animals. Rather, the purpose was to render the boundary between beast and man even more indistinct than it was becoming.54 Indeed, the chasm between the human and animal kingdoms narrowed con- siderably in the early modern era. First, relations with domestic animals were always more intimate than notions of human ascendancy might suggest. Living in close proximity to humans, animals often assumed personality. In early modern England, as in Jamaica, cows were always given individual names, but, unlike Vineyard, these names were not usually human ones. Perhaps in Jamaica the close linkage of slaves and stock facilitated the jettison- ing of old injunctions about never giving an animal a Christian name. In Jamaica, a fateful bridging of the gap between certain persons and certain beasts seems to have gone farther than in England-to the point of sharing names. Whether naming was primarily the responsibility of whites or blacks- more likely, a combination of the two-is less important than the existence of shared names. Second, mankind's relationship to certain favored animals grew closer in the eighteenth century. Keeping pets became fashionable; Thistlewood's interest in cage-birds and butterfly collecting was typical of the age. Perhaps here too white Jamaicans were influenced by their slaves, who probably had a less distanced view of animals than whites. Thus Dick's anthropomorphic naming of his dogs, his interest in inspiring their loyalty, the slaves' animal tales, the biting of cattle tails, the sexual uses of animal parts (rat turd powder as an aphrodisiac, for example), and the ritual use of animals or animal parts (whether fowls at funerals, abengs or cow horns on musical occasions, and cowlike headdresses in John Canoe festivals) suggest the prox- imity that already existed between slaves and animals. Slaves may well have coined many of the Jamaicanisms that connect animal, human, and plant worlds: dog-driver to denote a sugar estate manager who treats his laborers like dogs; goat-pepper because of its goatlike odor; hog-apple, hog-berry, hog coco, hog-grass, hogmeat, hog plum, hogweed, all types of feed for pigs. Finally, the narrowing of the distance between humans and animals owed much to scien- tific classifications or reclassifications of primates. A closer sense of affinity with the animal creation could weaken old assumptions about human unique- 54 Edwards, History... of the British West Indies, II, iMi; Richard Ligon, A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbadoes ...

But striking a blow at human pride might be compensated, at least for whites, by arguing for different species of humans. By ascribing a common detestable trait to monkeys and Africans, Thistlewood could pull slaves down to the level of beasts. Here he anticipates Edward Long's view that the pri- mate was closer to the African than was the African to the white person. 55 Increasingly, then, white Jamaicans singled out the supposed animal-like traits in their slaves. Almost without exception, their characterizations were highly pejorative: slaves were willing to eat snakes, worms, and grubs, foods improper for humans; they ate voraciously, without a semblance of civility; some Africans were cannibals; they were sexually promiscuous; they had a strong odor; their hair, in Long's words, was a "bestial fleece"; they went naked; they treated their offspring barbarically. If early modern Englishmen generally attributed to animals those impulses they feared in themselves- gluttony, sexuality, uncleanliness, ferocity-no other humans were said to share all of these features more intensely than Africans.56 Attitudes toward animals, then, were closely linked to attitudes toward slaves. Whether attitudes toward animals were harsh or compassionate, dis- tanced or intimate, the implications for slaves seem almost always to have been negative. An emphasis on human ascendancy and the great gulf between human and beast encouraged the assumption that people who lived most like animals must somehow be beasts. Conversely, the undermining of notions of human uniqueness, to which slaves unwittingly may have con- tributed, could pave the way for the argument that some people were really more animal than human. This tendency was the more dangerous of the two because it could and did lead to vicious racism. Either way, blacks were obvi- ous victims. The joining of animals and slaves in the contemporary mind had tragic consequences. The degradation to which the Vineyard slaves were subject was both mental and physical. Thistlewood was inclined to regard his slaves as human stock. He and other Jamaican overseers worked their slaves onerously, fed them poorly, whipped them harshly, and exploited them sexually. At the same time, Thistlewood, and others like him, depended on his slaves, who constantly struggled to maintain their humanity despite the outrages visited on them. They worked for the manager in varied and flexible ways; they exchanged goods and services with him; they showed him that they could acquire prop- erty and supplement their diets; they fed him their dishes; they danced and made music for him; some even befriended him; and, above all, they educated him. They fully engaged'him in an astonishing human drama of social and cultural exchange. Even more tragic than the coupling of animals and slaves in the white Jamaican mind is the way in which exploitation and mutuality coexisted at Vineyard. 55 Thomas, Man and the Natural World, esp. chaps. 2, 3; Jordan, White over Black, 492-94; Cassidy and Le Page, eds., Dictionary ofjamaican English, I54, I99, 226-27. 56 These characterizations can be found in, for example, Sloane, Voyage to the Islands, I, xx, xxv, xlviii; Long, History ofjamaica, II, 352, 353, 382, 383; and Edwards, History ... of the British West Indies, II, 73, 89, go, 98.
