<plain_text><page sequence="1">the world OF the MUGGLETONIANS. By Christopher Hill, Barry Reay and William Lamont. London: Temple Smith. 1983. x + 195 pp. Â£12.50. 1 his reviewer recently described the Muggletonians as an idiosyncratic millenanan sect...founded by Lodowick Muggleton and John Reeve...they preserved a shadowy existence from the mid-seventeenth century to the twentieth...a group who took the millennium seriously, though they were themselves seldom taken seriously'. That description, it now appears, was on most counts wrong. The Muggletonians were not, strictly speaking, millenarian; according to the sociological criteria of a sect - exogamy, confrontation with church, state and society - they were only partly sectarian; they preserved more than a 'shadowy' existence down to the twentieth century, and survived into the 1970s; they were not founded by Lodowick Muggleton and John Reeve, but by John Reeve and Lodowick Muggleton, in that order; and, finally, they must now, with the appearance of this collection of essays, be taken seriously.</page><page sequence="2">EARLY MODERN 321 In the overture, 'Why bother about the Muggletonians?', Lamont surveys the debate over popular participation in the tumults of the mid-seventeenth century, emphasising the secular egalitarianism of the radical sects and taking the lid off an 'underworld' of subversive notions about creation and the mortality of the soul. Barry Reay's first contribution to the collection, 'The Muggletonians: an introductory survey', shows how the group was rooted in the Joachimist tradition, even though the Muggletonians renounced Joachim's trinitarianism, the source of his scheme of history. They expressed, and resolved, Calvinist tensions about election; nicodemists in the Lollard or Familist mould, they adapted themselves to survive the Clarendon Code through concealment. The complex theology, christology, angelology and demonology of the group is examined by Hill in 'John Reeve and the origins of Muggletonianism'. They were obsessed with creation and procreation, and their creational myth, reminiscent of that of Carlo Ginzburg's heretical miller Mennochio, reduces God to manageable, indeed human, proportions, especially since He creates out of something rather than nothing and is checked and balanced by various forces - angels, demons and Reason. Their theory 'that God hath a bodily shape' (a rather modest one) may have reflected a plebeian and heretical anthropomorphism going back at least to the Lollards, but their actual vision of this limited deity - a 'grave, ancient, holy, old man' - probably owed as much as anything to subterranean traditions of parish church iconography. The diminution of God, possibly as a mechanism by which the suppressed classes of medieval and early modern Europe could cope with the concept of His authority and thus with all authority, went through a marked revival in the mid-seventeenth century with the Muggletonians. This revival also pointed the way to the future, for the reduction of God, as Lamont shows in 'Lodowick Muggleton and "Immediate Notice" ', allowed Muggleton to play down the catastrophic and revolutionary notion of the 'special intercession of Providence' and thus permitted the movement to come to terms with the institutions of post- Revolutionary England, which were endorsed by a merely 'general providence, which is over all God's works'. This clearly written and fascinating book, based on a sensational archival discovery, is offered at a reasonable price and deserves to be widely read.
