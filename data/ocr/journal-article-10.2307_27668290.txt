<plain_text><page sequence="1">Romantic Imagery in Tykwer's Lola rennt Grant P. McAllister Wake Forest University Lola rennt engages twenty-first-century audiences through a plethora of post-modern themes such as chance, circumstance, and time. However, the film's treatment of representation, in particular its circular re-presentation of a single event, reflects questions of aesthetic representation introduced by Romantics such as Schlegel and Novalis. In accordance with Romantic theories of representation, Tom Tykwer's cinematic recontextualizing of represen tation centers on the definition of the subject as a self-reflective construction of art through art. Lola's action, her running, mirrored by the film's literal act of "running" defines Lola's and the film's aesthetic and figurative essence, which is Lola rennt As Tom Tykwer's Lola rennt approaches its lOth-year anniversary, it is time to reexamine the film's aesthetic constitution from which it burst forth upon a fawning public. Of course, the film's romance-laden and circular narrative, its collage aesthetic and mythical reality resonate with twenty-first-century audi ences flooded with computer-animated imagery and virtual realities. Today's subjects endure a diverse barrage of visual, literary, and audible texts, finding themselves inebriated from a satyric orgy of metaphor. Perhaps Lola rennt succeeds because it offers the visually fractured millennial subject a parallel narrative about confronting representations and master narratives professing facts and reality. For if Lola rennfs aesthetic constitution comprises anything more than a simplistic love story, it certainly establishes a critique of repre sentation and narrative. Surprisingly, the manner in which Tykwer frames this critique is not en tirely twenty-first-century, modern, or postmodern. Although the medium of aesthetic presentation is a product of twentieth-century "modern" technology, the letter of the film's critique harkens back to another fin de si?cle and earlier theories of non-closure, representational ambiguity, and semiotic trace. As postmodern theory claims, every discourse and every sign conceals a trace of another sign, another discourse. If there is indeed another discourse in this film's deceptively postmodern text, it speaks with a Romantic twang. The film's treatment of representation, its concept of truth, its ironic and circular narrative, and its peculiar theory of self-definition all converge in a Schlegelian Romantic spiral of symphilosophic Poesie?a synthesis of the work and the work's own self-production.</page><page sequence="2">332 German Studies Review 30/2 (2007) This is not the first time contemporary aestheticians or philosophers have employed Romantic theories to examine questions of representation. As new technology repeatedly readdresses a long history of aesthetic questions initiated by Kant, the specter of Romanticism frequently rears its ironic head. When Benjamin and Heidegger found themselves confronted with the mechanical reproduction of the image at the turn of the twentieth century, they examined modern representation through a Romantic lens.1 A hundred years later, new technological advancements in computer-aided drawing and digital processing of the image again complicate the question of representation. Like Benjamin and Heidegger, Tykwer uses Romantic discourse to formulate a theoretical structure to examine questions and expand the limits of contemporary filmmaking. Ro mantic imagery also abounds in his other works, including Winterschl?fer and in particular Der Krieger und die Kaiserin, where the Romantic self-reflective motif of the Doppelg?nger ?nds center stage. Yet Lola rennt outpaces all his other works, as she runs into a new millennium of unprecedented visual, audible, and visual representation, and reenters the debate of Darstellung (representation) through the back door of Romantic rhetoric. Without question the film lends itself to debate and to various theoretical interpretations. For example, critics Alexandra Ludewig and Mathias Keller read Lola renntvia Nietzsche.2 Ingeborg Majer O'Sickey provides a compelling analysis of film's subversion of gender and power relations via the techno-char acter Lola, who ultimately loses her desire for desire. Or in Nietzschean terms, she loses her "will to power."3 Tom Whalen employs Hegel in his analysis, and Christine Haase reads Lola rennt against the backdrop of De Certau.4 Robert A Lauer suggests that the film's cyclical and repetitive structure evokes not only a modern or Nietzschean view of aesthetics, but that it also anticipates postmodern society.5 Certainly Lauer is correct in identifying the film's affinity to postmodern theory, especially its three-minute self-reflective preface, which introduces the idea of non-closure and tautology with intertextual quotations from T. S. Eliot's "Little Gidding" and the famed German soccer coach Sepp Herberger's comment "nach dem Spiel ist vor dem Spiel." However, not all critics view the film as a postmodern construction. Owen Evans argues the film is not postmodern, but rather optimistically humanistic, celebrating the can-do human spirit of love.6 Yet no critic has identified the self-constitutive aesthetic theory that mirrors Jena Romanticism: Friedrich Schlegel's self-re flexive notion that a theory of a novel must itself be a novel,7 and Novalis' idea of autopoiesis, a poetic construction of the self.8 My argument is that Tykwer's film is a Romantic text, producing an autonomous, self-productive aesthetic that is both character, Lola, and work, Lola rennt. Lola, the work and title character, is reminiscent of Kleist's impetuous and doggedly determined Romantic goddess Penthesilia. Like Penthesilia, Lola refuses to surrender and repeatedly rises from the dust of violent defeats to</page><page sequence="3">Grant P. McAllister 333 win. Yet Lola is also digitized and driven by Silicon-Valley processing speed. She is imbued with twenty-first-century hustle, conveyed not only in fashion and style, but in personality as well. She is a female who barks at authority and gazes into the eyes of patriarchal edifices with heart-wrenching scorn. Lola embodies a healthy dose of millennium restlessness and irreverence, smashing through patriarchal boundaries and disregarding any imposition of limits like temporality and, especially, mortality. Not once but twice, she wills a continu ation of life via a disruption of linear time where conventional notions of time and death would have concluded with an impervious closure. Most importantly, she plays with representations of patriarchal authority, specifically money?the currency defining the reciprocal relationship between master and slave, truth and deception, and male and female. Lola perceives the world as a fluid game, an aesthetic Spiel, and chooses to create her own reality aesthetically. Lola exudes optimism. She believes in herself and readily overcomes obstacles. She wills her own destiny with the ear-piercing pitch of a scream ing fury. Her frequently uttered phrase: "ich will es!" defines her character and establishes the mode with which she rewrites fate, determines chance, and alters established notions of time. Moreover, she accomplishes all of this with the drive and determination of the childhood train "that could," running along while breathing: "ich schaff's, ich schaff's (I can do it, I can do it)." The literal meaning of Lola's ability "to do" the impossible is clear. Less obvious is the implicit meaning of schaffen, meaning to create. Lola is able to determine destiny, alter the time continuum, and rewrite the narrative flow of the film precisely because she creates (schafft) it. She is the symbolic Romantic author of the self-titled production Lola rennt, and represents the active force and formative voice behind the creation that is the film. She is character, author, and work, whose incessant running as the character "Lola" symbolically echoes the whirling circular cans of the film as it "runs." The first section analyzes the film's introduction, which introduces itself and the aesthetic theory framing the film?a theory epitomized by tautology and self-referentiality.The introduction presents the problem of circular repre sentation, which is itself corralled by space and time. The next section analyzes the first and second "running" scenes or re-presentations, as counterpoints, as thesis and antithesis. These two scenes establish the two competing discourses interacting in each "running" scene: Lola, the female voice of subversion, and her "father," the patriarchal voice of authority striving to maintain the status quo. The last section examines the film's final scene that presents a synthesis, where Lola does not simply invert patriarchal power structures to gain her au thorial influence, but rather acts and plays within patriarchal spaces to achieve her goal?acquiring one hundred thousand German Marks without "playing" (working) by the patriarchy's rules. However, the film's synthesis engenders a rather ambiguous open ending, suggesting Lola's running is far from over. The</page><page sequence="4">334 German Studies Review 30/2 (2007) synthesis itself becomes a new thesis, implying an endless process of progres sivity. In Romantic terms, the film's open-ended conclusion allows for multiple interpretations. It is the means by which the work continues to evolve and develop through a reader's own interpretive contributions. As Schlegel noted: "Der wahre Leser muss der erweiterte Autor sein."9 The Preface Importantly, the film opens more like a book than a film. In the first five min utes, written quotations and extensive narration dominate the screen. In this "written" preface, the film presents a theme of existential woe engendered by the inflexible confines of time. A quotation by T.S. Eliot describes the futility of one's searching, which inevitably concludes where one begins: "am Ende allen unseren Suchens sind wir am Ausgangspunkt zur?ck." The famous soc cer coach Sepp Herberger's tautological statement "nach dem Spiel ist vor dem SpieF (after the game is before the [next] game) reinforces a theme of circular determinism. Shortly thereafter the ticking of a stopwatch can be heard, fol lowed by the swinging pendulum of a massive grandfather clock, suggesting time in the film is itself a patriarchal authority. After the pendulum comes to rest and the beat of the ticking stopwatch quickens to double time, a gargoyle positioned at the top of the clock opens its mouth and consumes the viewers' gaze, projecting them into a black void that slowly gives way to anxious whis pers and a chaotic crowd. Then a narrator, the popular "uncle of German fairytales,"10 Hans Paetsch, begins to speak. His words reemphasize the tautological dilemma facing "lost" subjects, noting that one's quest for self-knowledge is paradoxically answered by more questions. As the narrator announces this pessimistic paradox, the viewer's gaze mingles through a chaotic collection of people, momentarily pausing on certain characters in the film. Finally, the viewer's gaze fixates on a guard who greets the reader/viewer with an enigmatic statement: "Ball ist rund, Spiel neunzig Minuten, so viel schon mal klar, alles andere ist Theorie." He then kicks the ball in the air, bringing the audience's view with the ball, where one looks down on the anthropomorphic representation of letters spelling out "Lola rennt." The film transforms into an animation sequence, picturing Lola running through a spiral-like tunnel, shattering credits and tearing webs. The animation is interrupted by an introduction of actors, posing like criminals for mug shots. The mug shots lapse into film footage, and one sees and hears the ringing of a phone. Lola answers and learns she is late. Surprisingly, Lola does not panic at the prospect of being late. In fact the film's initial affinity to existential determinism is ironic. For on a closer read ing, one sees the film's initial suggestion of circularity belies a hint of ironic progression. In the T. S. Eliot quotation, the subject's return to the start of his "search" ends with the subject learning something, namely an understanding</page><page sequence="5">Grant P. McAllister 335 of the place where the search begins. Similarly, Herberger's idea that the end ing of a soccer game constitutes a new game's beginning (nach dem Spiel ist vor dem Spiel) implies one starts the next game with knowledge gained from the last. In this manner, the film's discussion of circularity appears to describe a spiral evolution, further suggesting the film's own representational structure is not made up of exact copies, but rather similar re-presentations of a single event. Each re-presentation of the same incident (Lola's running to save Manni) involves a slight diversion and progression from the previous representation, indicating representation of the film's narrative advances by building upon previous representations in a m?tonymie fashion. Additionally, the image of time as an absolute is questioned. The faster, condensed pace of the ticking stopwatch and the quickly spinning arms of the clock present time as if it were spinning out of control on a runaway course of self-destruction. The clock's gargoyle with its gaping open mouth and exposed teeth presents another quandary. It effectively consumes itself as much as it consumes viewers and characters. The visual import of a mouth lined with ra zor-sharp teeth conveys a vaginal dentate, suggesting the clock's metamorphosis into a mouth could be interpreted as metaphorical castration of the grandfa ther clock's linear time. "Father Time's" swinging pendulum is replaced by a circular dark cavity. The flaccid hanging position of the clock's pendulum or "Glied," as the clock stops, insinuates "Father Time" is now impotent. In terms of the film's structure, the image of linear time being replaced by circularity proclaims the film's narrative "time" will not proceed in a linear (patriarchal) fashion. The substitution of linear time by a cavernous chasm, a euphemistic womb, indicates narrative time will be disrupted by a female, her open mouth, her voice or perhaps her scream. However, once inside the clock's open mouth, a male, not a female, guard establishes the aesthetic rules of the film. The guard, the film's metaphorical figure of patriarchal authority, announces that the ball is round, the game is 90 minutes long, and that everything else is simply theory. With this statement, the guard provides the film's most explicit self-reflective and self-critical state ment. The absolute facts or truths are that the ball, the medium of play (its method of representation), is round?a reemphasis about the circular mode of representation in the film?and that the game, the structure of play, lasts 90 minutes?roughly the length of the film itself. Everything else is theory, i.e., the body of the film?its plot?is theory. Stated differently, the core of Lola rennt is a theory of film presented as film. The guard then kicks the ball allow ing the viewer a visual glimpse of the meaning behind the guard's statement: people, the film's characters, its organic constituency, spell out or perform the theory o? Lola rennt. As the ball falls through the center of this anthropomorphic representation of the film's title, the audience views the film's first animation sequence and the film's key performer, Lola. She is the aestheticized (literally</page><page sequence="6">336 German Studies Review 30/2 (2007) sketched) theory of the game in action, the self-titled heroine, who constitutes the film's "body" and its aesthetic theory through her running. The animation scene not only repeats the Romantic idea of mixing genres (animation and film), but also reflects the Romantic writers' tendency to draw attention to the artificial or fabricated nature of their works. Animation reminds the viewer more strongly than actual film footage that the image is indeed art. Importantly, the cartoon Lola is pictured smashing the credits of the film's creators and contributors. Her destruction is not vain vandalism. Rather, she is erasing the presence and contribution of the film's creators and is substituting their presence with her own; metaphorically, she purloins creative potential. However, she does not smash and erase every credit and name. She leaves the film's writer and producer, Tom Tykwer, alone, and for a moment, both share the stage and the credit for the film's aesthetic structure. Tykwer and Lola's sharing of the stage can be highlighted to emphasize certain extradiegetic aspects such as Tykwer and Franka Potente 's relationship off the set. While such interpretations might explain the intensity of certain actors' performances, this highly aestheticized cartoon sequence introduces a far more significant theme concerning authorial authority. In Romanticism authorship is an organic progress evolving from author, work, and reader, where all engage in a process of self-reflection. Even though Tom Tykwer has a hand in every aspect of the film's creation, his status as an auteur does not preclude a self-reflective relationship between author and work, where the author finds himself reflected in the work and the work in the author. Moreover, it is plau sible that Lola, especially this highly aesthetic and purposefully drawn Lola, symbolizes the feminized embodiment of Tykwer's creative potential. She gives voice and face to his aesthetic design, his name. Adopting feminine attributes is also part and parcel of the Romantic program. Schlegel and even Goethe ap propriate metaphors of female fecundity to describe the aesthetic inception and birth of their works. Therefore, rather than completely undermining Tykwer's authorial status, Lola's sparing of Tykwer's name suggests both authorial voices ultimately fuse in a Romantic expression of author/work reflection. Other aesthetic and self-critical implications emerge from the animation sequence. In particular, the clocks provide hints about the film's aesthetic theory, as they turn into devouring mouths or vaginal dentates. Lola, the cartoon, re peatedly jumps through these anthropophagie clocks unscathed. Yet there is a deeper philosophical implication behind these consuming time pieces, beyond the gender implications. The mouth is the literal locus of the sense to taste, and taste, as a metaphorical value judgment, lies at the very foundation of German aesthetics, epitomized by Winkelmann's study of Greek art and notions of "good taste" (guten Geschmacks). It appears that the clocks' consumption, their tasting of Lola constitute a similar aesthetic judgment. The film metaphorically critiques itself, tastes its quality. However, the film inverts the metaphorical</page><page sequence="7">Grant P. McAllister 337 usage of "taste" that refers to a mental judgment of art, and projects instead the image of a literal consumption of the aesthetic object.11 The film's literaliza tion of this aesthetic metaphor challenges classical notions of aesthetic value based on disinterested objectivity. The imagery suggests aesthetic judgment is itself a contributing, organic, facet of the entire project, and that the film's own physical and metaphysical qualities are inexorably entwined and integrated. Symbolically, the film's self-consumption stresses the leading representational motif of endless self-rebirth. The film purposely evokes the imagery of the mythical ouroboros, the self-consuming snake in order to better define the film's aesthetic theory personified in the character Lola, who repeatedly defies death. The imagery also contributes to the film's mythological and fairytale veneer. As Owen Evans suggests, the film is a modern-day fairytale, where Lola's bright red hair constitutes a twentieth-century Red Riding Hood.12 If Lola rennt is indeed a contemporary fairytale, it seems natural that the well-known fairytale narrator Hans Paetsch introduces the film's preface. Gen erations of Germans have grown up hearing myths and fairytales through his voice. Vocally he is a cipher for fantastic fiction, and his voice emphasizes that Lola rennt is indeed a M?rchen, a fiction intended to be viewed as an artifice. Paetsch's voice, in concert with his words questioning notions of existence (what one is), metaphorically establishes a self-reflexive critique, similar to Novalis' idea of critical reception: "Manche B?cher bed?rfen keiner Recension.... Sie enthalten schon die Recension mit."13 Through Paetsch's voice the film critiques its own aesthetic validity?a strikingly Romantic concept. The Romantics (Tieck, Novalis, Brentano, and Hoffmann) all praise and produce fairytales, and the genre itself came into its written form through the Grimm brothers, two Romantics. Moreover, the film's fairytale quality, inexorably associated with children, suggests that a theme of development or education (Bildung) frames the film's introspective story. The nascent "child" aging, growing, and maturing is the film itself. The character of Lola visually represents this aesthetic trans formation as she undergoes a process of Bildung and aesthetic development, which takes place within the playful structure of a representational "game." First Running Lola's first running sequence is prefaced by Manni, who provides the background of the plot and the impetus for Lola's subsequent running?he lost 100,000 Marks. Manni narrates the events that led up to his desperate phone call and his pleading for help. After completing an illegal transaction for the gangster Ronnie, he left a bag full of 100,000 Marks on the subway. A bum snitched the money, as Manni tried to escape controllers checking tickets. He would have never taken the subway; he only did because Lola was late and unable to pick him up as they had previously agreed. Now Manni is certain Ronnie will murder him for his amateurish mistake. Distraught and crying for help, Manni</page><page sequence="8">338 German Studies Review 30/2 (2007) begs Lola to extricate him from this dire situation. Immediately Lola's resolute and strong character comes to the forefront. She tries to calm Manni's nerves, and assures him she will come up with the money by the noon deadline. In contrast to Manni, Lola appears resolute and capable; Manni's puerile whimpering and pessimism contrasts with Lola's optimism and can-do spirit. Here the female is clearly the stronger, the more pragmatic, and the more capable of the two sexes. Moreover, when Manni questions Lola's orders, she barks back with a deafening scream, "weil ich es will" and shuts his mouth. Her female volition silences the errant voice of Manni's narration. She shuts his mouth with a formidable "will" that promises to produce the money in any manner possible, even if that requires an aesthetic tweaking of reality. However, Lola's aesthetic freedom is undermined by the fact she still lives under the roof of her parents and most notably the "law" of her father. In order to alter the film's narrative, and to turn back the hands of time, Lola ironically requires paternal permission. The question about Lola's dependence upon her father is found not in their literal relationship, but rather in their metaphorical or aesthetic relationship. Her father is the head manager of the bank Deutsche Transfer. The metaphorical significance of the bank's name lies in the word Transfer, which on the surface suggests a simple economic exchange. However, the word's Latin etymology (to carry over) conveys the same meaning as the Greek word metaphor. Moreover, the act of representation is founded on the basic premise of an exchange, a transfer, where an image, symbol, or word substitutes or stands in for an absent object.14 The bank, through its tide, is a bank of representation, and Lola's father is the keeper of the bank's currency, its representations. The interior of the bank is adorned with representations of currency from around the world?Marks, Dollars, and Schillings. The bank presents money as art, further implying currency and money are indeed synonymous with aesthetic representation. As a product of the text's aesthetic, its representational currency, it is only natural that Lola turn to her father and his institution in order to appropriate the aesthetic agency necessary to alter the narrative. Unfortunately for Lola, her "father" refuses to comply. The father's reason for denying Lola's request for money, which drives Lola to commit robbery, arises out of a question of paternity. Lola fails to gain access the bank's aesthetic currency because she is potentially appealing to the wrong "dad" for help. For, in fact, her father reveals Lola is a Kuckucksei, a bastard child. Like the bank in which he works, he is nothing but a metaphor, a substitute, a surrogate father. Her literal father seems absent and unknown. Or is he? The rather dubious conversation Lola's mother has with a Sagittarius or Sch?tze potentially identifies Lola's father. Phonetically and etymologically the word Sch?tze is related to sch?tzen, meaning to protect, as in the word Schutzmann.15 Perhaps Lola's father is in fact the guard?the same guard kicking off the "game" titled Lola in the film's introduction, and the guard in charge of protecting</page><page sequence="9">Grant P. McAllister 339 the film's bank of currency, its representational potential. This possibility is also suggested by the visual framing of the scene. After her father announces she is a cuckoo's egg (a bastard child), he opens a door, a frame, revealing the astonished guard on the other side of the door. Her father then says: "Jetzt wei?t du (now you know)." Not only does Lola know she is a "cuckoo's egg," but she also knows who her aesthetic, "framed," father is. The guard's paternity is probable not only physically, but also metaphysically. For the symbolic guardian of the text, the figure producing the most self-in trospective statement in the film, is indeed the guard. When he announces the rules of the game, he glances down, as if conversing with a child, a little Lola, whose animated running (playing of the game) coincidentally begins with his kicking the ball and his "und ab ! " (go !) The guard engenders the film's "running" metaphor, and he is in this sense the "father" of the text's most prominent theme of "running." Who else, after all, runs as hard and consistently as Lola? Without question, Lola's paternal quandary adversely affects her abil ity to secure the 100,000 Marks required to save her Manni. It seems males undermine her will at every turn. Like the red ambulance, which is delayed by a pane of glass?a fragile limit?as it races to save a victim, Lola, too, is stopped by a metaphorical patriarchal glass ceiling. Initially she is undermined by her surrogate father, the banker, who denies her access to the text's most powerful representation?money?and who also thrusts her into a paternal quandary. She is then derailed by Manni, who refuses to obey her and robs the Bolle. Ultimately Lola is killed by a rookie cop, a Sch?tze (shooter rather than Schutzmann, policeman or literally "protector"), who shoots Lola through the heart by mistake. The policeman's bullet is the physical shot to the heart redrawing the metaphorical shot unloosed by her surrogate father's paternal confession. Oddly, Lola's blood is not red; the color is a stark contrast to her hair and everything else associated with her. She bleeds black as ink, as if ink courses through her veins. She bleeds like a text, murdered by a protective representative of the film's own patriarchal voice, aborting its nascent produc tion, apparently beset on a path of self-destruction. Second Running The film's second running scene is prefaced by a break in the film's narrative time and space, a transcendental refuge outside the textual confines of the film's story. The scene is a glimpse into the inner world of Lola's intellect, the source of her aesthetic intuition. Like the film's introduction that questions intellectual certainty and emphasizes its own aesthetic status, the interlude between the first and second running sequences reveals that male concepts of certainty (Sicherheit) and belief (Glaube) ultimately resolve in the senses (Gef?hle) or aesthetics. In trying to answer Lola's question about the validity of his love for her, Manni struggles to provide a satisfying absolute answer. Yet</page><page sequence="10">340 German Studies Review 30/2 (2007) all he knows is what his feelings (his heart) tell him. His entire notion of love is based on intuition, not fact or absolute truth. His senses are the basis of his certainty and belief. In other words his belief system, his source of self-cer tainty, is unstable, not absolute, and, most importantly, aesthetic and subjective. Even though Manni's answer to Lola's question of love is unsatisfactory, his answer seems to provide Lola with the key to undermining male projections of security, which until now seemed impermeable and absolute. Time, money, and power, like Manni's sense of security, are all aesthetic. They too can be molded, permeated, and altered. As soon as Lola makes this decision (Ich muss mich entscheiden), she announces her volition (Ich will nicht weg. Stopp! [my emphasis]). She turns back the hands of time, rewrites the film's narrative, and re-presents her running once again. Like the first running sequence, the second begins with the ringing phone and the shot of Lola's mother speaking with her Sagittarius friend. However, everything else is slightly different. The mood, enhanced by the soundtrack, is palpably different. Now the music features lyrics dominated by the phrases: "Never, never give up," "do, do, do the right thing," and "I want." Each phrase reveals Lola's changed attitude in the second running. The phrases highlight Lola's desire to act (to do) and not to bow to outside pressure (never give up). Most importantly her will (I want) comes to the fore, indicating she will exer cise unwavering volition in this episode. The lyrics of the first running feature phrases dominated by subjunctive wishes and desires: "I wish I were a writer." In the second running she no longer wishes to be a writer, rather she becomes the scene's sole writer. Other differences are found within the small subplots accompanying Lola's run. In the first episode all women characters experience negative lives and men achieve success. On the subsequent second run, the women achieve success and dominance, demonstrated most pointedly by the female bank assistant who becomes a dominatrix, whipping the male teller. Acting as a running commentary on the film's main plot, the female dominatrix subplot indicates women now have the upper hand within the narrative. One can suspect Lola's banking experience will end on a slightly different note than the first. Indeed the similarities to the first running all but disappear once Lola gets to her father's bank. Most striking is the fact that fathers (males in general) lose their authority. This loss of patriarchal dominance is highlighted by the fact that Lola's father is essentially infertile, incapable of producing offspring. Subtextually, Lola's banking father is unable to create (procreate), to dictate the aesthetic progeny of the film. His function is completely symbolic. The discovery that his lover is pregnant with someone else's child emphasizes his reproductive and creative difficulties. His mistress' child is the second "child" who is not his own and whom Lola's "father" would raise.</page><page sequence="11">Grant P. McAllister 341 Most significantly, Lola herself undermines her father's claim to authority. She literally robs him, leaving him penniless, without any patriarchal "currency" or representation of power; she hijacks male currency and the representational power it wields. Not surprisingly, posters and pictures of money permeate ev ery scene in the bank. In fact, while Lola robs the bank, she and her father are separated by a huge poster of a Deutsche Mark, indicating money as art is the central metaphor in the second scene. It is the medium through which male subjects perpetuate their authority and dominance, and it is also the medium through which males lose that authority, as Lola steals it to establish her own aesthetic. Importantly, Lola also usurps the authority of the guard by taking his gun and using it against the entire establishment of male authority. By taking the gun, Lola adopts the patriarchal means of control that ended her previous run ning sequence. Her ability to skillfully wield the gun reveals she has successfully inverted power relations. Whereas she appears unable to "man" the weapons of male authority in the first scene, she now adeptly turns off the safety with the ease and skill of a professional Sch?tze. She has become the symbolic autho rial "voice" of the second episode who barks orders at males, and through her voice, or rather her scream, she appears able to determine her own narrative fate. For example, when she finds herself surrounded by police as she exits the bank doors, it seems her criminal "run" has come to an end; however, she simply mutters, "Das gibt's nicht," and miraculously the guards mistake her for an innocent bank customer and whisk her away to safety. Through her inversion of power structures, Lola, the robber, is now the innocent victim, while her father, the banker, remains confined in the bank like a jailed criminal. This ironic inversion of power is voiced by the police who announce that the structure is surrounded: "Das Geb?ude ist umstellt." Interestingly, the verb umstellen could be understood as being placed upside down: stellen means to place and urn means around or upside down. This supplemental meaning of the verb umstellen metaphorically describes the state of affairs in the film's textual economy: the structure is not just surrounded, but rather turned on its head. Things have been inverted. Lola rules supreme and has co-opted the male's currency and his power. She has broken through the proverbial "glass ceiling" of male privilege, just like the red ambulance?Lola's allegorical leitmotif?that smashes through the pane of glass that stopped the ambulance in the first running episode. It appears nothing will stop Lola from achieving her goal. Like the color green of the bag holding the stolen currency, all intersections seem to open and yield to her. This bag of currency, this metaphor of aesthetic representa tion, gives her the power to manipulate and drive her own destiny, to write her own narrative. She even expresses self-assured faith in herself and her ability as she runs along whispering: "ich schaff's, ich schaff's." She clearly</page><page sequence="12">342 German Studies Review 30/2 (2007) believes in herself and her ability to create and determine (schafft) the events in the film's narrative. In this running, she is the film's sole author and voice, which has severe negative implications. She gains her voice through thievery, by stealing the symbolic "currency" of patriarchal dominance. Like the bicycle she claims is stolen (geklaut), the vehicle (the narrative) she now drives is hot, red hot?perhaps too hot. For ultimately no one can stop Lola from achiev ing her goal except Lola herself. Like the Romantic text exhausting itself in its self-critical reflexivity, Lola ultimately undermines herself through her own exuberant self-reflexivity. Lola nullifies all males including the man she is trying to save, ultimately the purpose behind her running. It is a negation of existence, a murder, metaphorically presented by her allegorical leitmotif, the red ambulance, running over Manni. Thus, Lola's second game comes to another tragic end. Except this time the male dies, concluding the nexus of inversions that characterize Lola's second running. Lola's power play ends tragically like the first running because the same structure of dominance is repeated. Only now the film's narrative is determined by the female. She usurps every male position of authority, including the guard, her father, and the policemen surrounding the bank. She essentially negates their presence, crosses them out like an editorial erasure. The first sequence concludes with the death of the female; subtextually, Lola as a textual cipher is punctured and bled of her ink. Not surprisingly, the second episode ends with the death of a male, whose outstretched arms and legs on the street cre ate a visual X, metaphorically indicating Lola has effectively crossed out male presence and authority. Coincidentally, the name of Tom Tykwer's company is X-Filme. Manni's lifeless body splayed out on the street in the symbol of an X suggests Lola also kills the film's producer, writer, and director, essentially negating the film itself. This is the cause of her second failure. In the first running, she is the victim of patriarchal, "fatherly," authority. In the second, she inverts that paradigm and victimizes all males, even her lover, Manni, and the named author of Lola's aesthetic reflection, her self-titled production Lola rennt. Third Running Similar to the first running, the second ends with a narrative interlude, a space beyond narrative time and action. As the interlude begins, the gender and power inversion of the second running is still being played out. Manni appears vulnerable and asks seemingly unanswerable questions regarding Lola's love for him. Significantly, Manni's worries reflect the inverted nature of the second running: he is worried Lola would forget him, erase him from her re-cogni tion if he were to die. Certainly Lola's attitude in the second running bears out Manni's concerns. For indeed Lola does forsake everything male in her ironic attempt to manipulate the film's narrative in order to save a male. Realizing</page><page sequence="13">Grant P. McAllister 343 the mistakes from her previous running, she answers Manni's doubts with the resolute: "Ich w?rde dich nicht vergessen," and "Du bist nicht gestorben." Symbolic of her death-defying and can-do attitude, Lola not only promises to remember Manni, but also resurrects him from death. Unlike the second running, which is a mere inverted copy of the first running, the third begins with a theme of synthesis. The soundtrack combines melodies and lyrics of both the first and the second running. Most notably the phrase: "I wish I were ..." from the first running is paired by the dominant phrase of the second running: "never, never say never! "16 Also there is a parallel narrative dominated by males, which accompanies Lola's "running" narrative. Lola, the female voice, shares narrative space with a strictly male narration. At the core of this male narrative is the bicycle thief, Mike, whom Lola repeatedly meets in her runnings. In this subplot, Mike encounters the bum who stole Manni's bag of money at an Imbiss and sells the bike to him. This creates a temporal lapse in time, allowing Manni to see the bum on the bike, whom Manni then chases through a traffic intersection, causing a major pileup that involves and kills Lola's "banking" father. Eventually Manni catches the bum and retakes his bag full of money. Within this male narrative, Manni, the "man" as his name suggests, saves himself. Yet Lola continues to run, to "play" the game. Although Lola's goal of acquir ing 100,000 Marks is accomplished by Manni himself, Lola's narrative ironically continues to develop. However, Lola now runs not entirely for Manni's sake, but also for her own personal freedom and self-definition. She is engrossed in a struggle, a literal Rennen (race), for the authorial agency of her own narrative, her own fate. This struggle for textual control manifests itself in the conflict between Lola and her father, which remains unresolved. Importantly, Lola's paternal struggles no longer involve her surrogate "banking" father, but her textual "father," the text's guard of aesthetic representation, the Sch?tze. Thus Lola never enters the bank, the space once occupied by her surrogate father. Rather she remains outside the structure and confronts the guard instead. He alone represents the final male impediment to Lola's aesthetic freedom. Surprisingly, he anticipates Lola's arrival, and in his typically patronizing tone states: "Ja, da bist du mein Schatz" (my emphasis). It is more than mere coin cidence that he refers to Lola as his Schatz, &amp; term of endearment usually used for one's lover or child. Significantly, Schatz (treasure) also denotes material ownership and possession. By referring to Lola as his treasure, the guard em phasizes she belongs to him. She is his object, his worthy property. However, Lola counters the guard's statement with a searing gaze that shuts his otherwise flippant and patronizing mouth, and then she simply turns her back on him and the bank?an act of personal defiance that sends the guardian's heart into erratic arrhythmia.</page><page sequence="14">344 German Studies Review 30/2 (2007) By turning away from the guard and the bank, Lola turns her back on male institutions, rules, and regulations. She also turns her back on the security the bank portends. For indeed banks crash, like her father's accident with Meyer, and they fail, similar to the guard's failing heart. With no father figure to ap peal to, no patriarchal structure to provide an illusion of security, Lola seems lost and without a goal. As she runs along, she whispers: "Hilf mir. Hilf mir." Robert Lauer suggests Lola is appealing to a higher power, to God himself.17 It is possible Lola beseeches divine intervention or calls on Fortuna to throw her a lucky hand. However, she might be asking herself for help. After all, she has already turned her back on patriarchal figures, and it seems unlikely that she would immediately surrender her burgeoning independence by submitting her destiny to a divine father or chance. Yet when she finally stops running, it seems chance is exacdy what she seeks; for she appears to find the answer to her problems in a casino. By entering the casino, she substitutes one institution (the bank) for another (the casino). Instead of abiding by the rational, calculable, and mathematical rules of a bank, all of which provide a veil of security, Lola enters the openly insecure world of gaming, where she can play with chance and with currency as representations. Moreover, gambling lies outside the traditionally accepted norms of economic exchange; one either loses or gains inequitably. In terms of the theory of representation, the casino symbolizes a subversive, yet ironically "valid" form of economic exchange, and Lola seems to sense that through this seditious institution she can achieve her goal. Like the bank, the casino is a man's world and has its own rules and regula tions, and as such, Lola initially appears unworthy to enter. The cashier, a female guardian of sorts, tells her: "so, kommen Sie hier nicht rein." Yet, instead of preventing her from entering or forcing her to wear more appropriate clothing, she gives Lola the 100 Mark chip, opening the door for her chances of winning. Once inside, the audience realizes Lola is in an unfamiliar world. The music accompanying her entrance is rhythmic and full of primitive drumbeats and exotic melodic lines, indicating she is a foreigner in a different world, possibly a jungle of male predators. Or perhaps the music signifies Lola's presence as the foreign outsider from the "dark continent," the aboriginal woman, threat ening the male order of this patriarchal world. The male pit bosses ogle Lola intensely with her suggestively sexual, disheveled fire-red hair, perspiring skin, and visible bra as if her sex constitutes a potential threat. Her sheer impudence and utter disregard for patriarchal rules and tradition seem to take the males by surprise, for she simply walks through the crowd of males and places her bet without conflict. The pit bosses' hesitation to act and to confront her conspicu ous presence, ironically provides Lola with the opportunity to infiltrate and subvert their game, and appropriate male representational power, or money.</page><page sequence="15">Grant P. McAllister 345 Lola chooses to play roulette, a reflection of the film's aesthetic structure. The game encapsulates the aesthetics of the film perfectly: there is circular ity, the colors black and red, and a round ball that runs against the flow of the rotating structure of the game. Moreover, Lola plays number 20, the number of minutes or the amount of time she has to come up with 100,000 Marks. Metaphorically, Lola's playing roulette is synonymous with her playing with the theory of the film. Even though it appears she is playing with chance, it is clearly her volition that determines the game's outcome. After she wins the first round with a fervent hope that guides the ball onto the number 20, she lets it all ride for one more spin. During this make-or-break moment, Lola belts out an ear-piercing scream shattering glasses and halting a clock in its revolution. Like the gargoyles in the film's introduction, Lola's gaping mouth seems to derail time and patriarchal rules of chance. Interestingly, after Lola wins the improbable bet, all the characters are frozen in their gaze upon Lola, who has already turned her back to them. The film then focuses on a paint ing of a woman with her back turned toward the viewer. Her hair is tied up in a circular bun, repeating the film's prominent motif of a spiral. As the film's focus brings the viewer's gaze closer to the painting, it becomes clear that the painting functions like a mirror reflection of Lola's back, and that the viewer is essentially looking at the back of this woman, just as all the patrons of the casino are staring at Lola's back when she exits. Lola, the woman, is in the lead, running away with the prize, the money, the ball, and guiding the eyes of those who passively follow her every move?the audience. She has become the film. Undoubtedly Lola gets her cash and runs away to deliver it to Manni. To expedite her run, she jumps into the red ambulance and discovers the bank guard, the Sch?tze^ in the throes of a full-blown cardiac arrest, which she earlier precipitated with a scornful gaze before turning her back on him. The guard reaches for Lola's hand, and she gives him hers and utters the enigmatic phrase: "Ich geh?re zu ihm." The English translation reads: "I'll stay with him." However, the literal meaning is much more telling. She announces that she belongs (geh?rt) to him, to the guard?the film's narrative guard. Once she announces this fact, the guard's heartbeat steadies. Lola's revelation of relations is multifaceted. Not only does she admit he is her father, and she is his child, but she also admits that she belongs to him. Metaphorically, she surrenders herself as an aesthetic product to his guardianship. Yet there is an ironic twist in Lola's surrender. In Hegel's master/slave dialectic, the bondsman surrenders his will to the lord, but ironically gains or adopts the freedom of self-certainty of the lord.18 Similarly, Lola admits that she is the property of the film's lord, its authority figure; yet, in doing so, she defines herself as the film. The film's other similarity to Hegel's dialectic concerns Hegel's idea that the bondsman achieves self-certainty through his work, his activity in opposition to the inactivity of</page><page sequence="16">346 German Studies Review 30/2 (2007) the lord. Lola's activity, her running, enacts a Hegelian self-defining dynamic, and constitutes the "activity" through which she becomes the workLola rennt.19 Lola is the life-force and body of the film, the red blood coursing through the heart of the production itself. She alone determines the beat of the heart, the narrative flow of the production. Conclusion The final scene recaps the major thematic features of the entire film. It fea tures Lola and Manni, a bag of money, and most importantly an unanswered question. Initially, the camera focuses on Lola looking for Manni. She utters his name: "Manni, Manni," a name that phonetically resembles "money." In calling out his name, Lola ironically identifies the male and what guarantees his life?money. As a cipher for the survival of the male himself, money func tions as the key representational metaphor driving the film and Lola's running. Ironically, Manni leaves his narrative alive, but broke, whereas Lola walks away from her narrative, not only alive, but also 100,000 Marks richer. Moreover, she holds in her hand not just any bag of money; she possesses metaphor it self, a literal life-giving necessity and the metaphorical life blood of the film's own narrative. Unaware of Lola's efforts, Manni expresses surprise at Lola's disheveled appearance and asks obliviously: "Wie siehst du denn aus? Bist du gerannt?" His ignorance emphasizes the peripheral role the male ultimately plays in the film. Due to Lola's presence, he is literally left out of the film's main narrative and its overriding metaphor of "running." He then asks another question, ending the film's dialog: "Was ist drin [in der Tasche]? "The question not only comes full-circle to the film's first running and the importance of the bag (die Tasche), but it also forces the film to end with an unanswered question. The film, in its structure and its narrative, returns to the introduction and the theoretical self-critical investigation where questions are answered by seem ingly more endless questions. The tautological conclusion of the film evokes the Romantic concept of metaphysics described by Schlegel in his posthumous Philosophical Fragments: "This metaphysics should proceed through several cycles, ever greater and longer. Once the end has been reached, it should start again from the begin ning, alternating between chaos and system, preparing chaos for the system, then a new chaos)."20 Certainly repetition is the prevalent characteristic in the film's thematic struc ture. Yet beyond a mere repetition of a singular event, repetition also suggests the question of aesthetic representation, which is characterized in Romanticism by an endless tautological re-presenting. Within this endless act of representa tion, the Romantics located the aesthetic construction of a system, a subject. In its ending, which reflects its initial self-questioning, the film not only repeats the Romantic idea of auto-criticism, but also evokes the Romantic concept of</page><page sequence="17">Grant P. McAllister 347 auto-production or autopoiesis. Lacoue-Labarthe and Nance define Romantic autopoiesis as the discursive construction of the subject through po?sie, or what Novalis would term a representation representing. Similarly the character Lola represents running, and through her running she becomes a representation of running, a film. The film's final shot of Manni and Lola walking hand-in-hand clarifies Lola's authorial status. She holds not only Manni's (the man's) hand, but also the bag of money initially meant for his survival. Metaphorically, she holds both the male and his means of economic representation in her hand. She is the medium through which representation represents. Not the male, but Lola, the female, becomes an instantiation of Romantic autopoiesis?a representation of the subject through the film Lola rennt. 1 In her book Delayed Endings, Alice Kuzniar frequently mentions Benjamin's affinity to Romantic theory: Alice Kuzniar, Delayed Endings: Nonclosure in Novalis and H?lderlin (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1987). In The Retreat of Representation: The concept of Darstellung in German Critical Discourse (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1996), Martha Heifer argues Benjamin's own analysis o? Darstellung is an instantiation of Romanticism (178). Heifer also identifies Nietzsche's and Heidegger's affinity to Romantic theories of language and representation or Darstellung. In her study Rep resentation and Its Discontents (Berkeley: California, 1992), Azade Seyhan indicates the similarities between Heidegger and Benjamin and Romanticism. Moreover, Seyhan argues deconstruction needs to "relive its past through the restless spirit of Romanti cism to exorcise its demons" (20-21). 2 Alexandra Ludewig and Mathias Keller, "Nietzsche ist nicht tot: Zumindest nicht in Lola rennt?
