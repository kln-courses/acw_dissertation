<plain_text><page sequence="1">Computers, Minds, and Texts: Preliminary Reflections William Paulson Man's very soul is due to the machines; it is a machine-made thing: he thinks as he thinks, and feels as he feels, through the work that machines have wrought upon him, and their existence is quite as much a sine qua non for his, as for theirs. Samuel Butler, Erewhon ("The Book of the Machines") OF ALL OBJECTS that minds can seek to know, the mind itself is at once the most central and the most intractable. To follow the Delphic and Socratic injunction to "Know thyself," one must face a double challenge of reflexivity and complexity: the mind is at once subject and object of knowledge, and the mind as object to be known is as rich in structure and variety as the mind as knowing subject. Attempts to know the mind thus proceed by detours, by ex- teriorizations, by models that simplify in the interest of gaining par- tial, figural insights. In this respect the study of the mind follows a path common to many other forms of inquiry, differing mainly in the radical difficulty of passing from indirect, modeled, or figurative ap- proaches to something like direct knowledge. Fontenelle, writing in the early eighteenth century, noted that the fables of antiquity and modern, Newtonian "philosophy" share a common principle: "we ex- plain the unknown things of nature by those that we have before our eyes, and we transport into Physics the ideas with which experience provides us." For the ancient fabulists, this known experience cen- tered on the life and movement of the human body, whence the anthropomorphism of their explanations of nature; for the moderns, known experience includes "what weights, springs, and levers can do," whence the mechanicism of theirs. "We have always represented the unknown in the figure of what was known to us."1 For Plato and Aristotle, memory and mind could be compared to a wax tablet, a medium of writing.2 The tabula rasa was to be a standard figure of philosophy until at least Locke, who compared the mind</page><page sequence="2">292 NEW LITERARY HISTORY prior to experience to "white paper, void of all characters."3 The nature of mind in ancient and early modern philosophy cannot of course be reduced to the figure of a writing surface, but it is this figure and not the philosophy of mind that I wish to emphasize here. In "The Book as Symbol" in his European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages, Ernst Robert Curtius surveys the career of the tablet or book as figure not only of mind but of the entire world as object of inquiry and knowledge.4 The ubiquity of liber mundi or liber naturae figures points to a profound and durable identification of knowing with read- ing. To investigate nature is to read nature's book. The representation of knowledge by reading may have been especially characteristic of the Hellenistic period and the Middle Ages, but the figure remained important to the very founders of the modern sciences that have come to limit sharply the domain of the book's authority. In his Discours de la mithode Descartes told of leaving the study of letters for that of "the great book of the world"; Galileo wrote that the book of nature is "written in a mathematical language" and can thus be read only by those whom we might now call-using a familiar present-day version of reading's figuration of knowledge-the "mathematically literate."5 By its pragmatic successes and its use of mathematics and experi- mentation, modern science severed the traditional link between knowledge and reading. Writing and book metaphors survived the Enlightenment, but lost much of their cognitive pertinence; increas- ingly they came to signify the self-consciousness and autonomy claims of Romantic and post-Romantic literature, a kind of writing thought to be separated from the serious discourses of knowledge. As Fon- tenelle suggested, science by no means put an end to explanation by figures and comparisons, but its figurations of universe, body, and mind were to be generally technological rather than scriptural. In Cartesian dualism, the bodily aspects of mental activity were described as a system of fluid mechanics, to which was adjoined an immaterial soul, seat of will and imagination. A century later, the materialist La Mettrie would describe all aspects of mind as the workings of a dy- namic mechanical system, specifically a system whose vibrating har- monic chords suggest musical instruments and automata. Closer to the present, Freud's successive "topographies" of the psyche made use of energetic, dynamic, and economic models. The digital computer is now our privileged model of organization, as ubiquitous as was the mechanical clock in the Enlightenment, and considerably more protean. The divine watchmaker, if not dead, has become the divine hacker. Computer concepts have entered the de- scription of life with the adoption of the concept of "genetic code," often called a "program that programs itself." Most important, the</page><page sequence="3">COMPUTERS, MINDS, AND TEXTS 293 computer has given new force and legitimacy to La Mettrie's program of describing mind as a strictly physical system of processes. The modern discipline of artificial intelligence (AI) works to construct such a system, and neuroscientists are beginning to use computer analogies as they try to understand the brain as a system of neurons. In place of the mind as text or machine, we theorize the mind as supercomputer. A leading literary scholar and advocate of educa- tional reform, E. D. Hirsch, Jr., writes of "the floppy disks in our minds."'6 The French sociologist Edgar Morin, attempting an ambi- tious synthesis on the physical/biological/anthropological/epistemo- logical bases of society and of the possibilities of understanding it, replaces the Cartesian cogito with the computo, the quantitative self- regulatory activity assumed to be a basis of every living thing's existence. Perhaps more than any previous artifact taken as a model of complexity and organization, the computer seems capable of real- izing Samuel Butler's vision of human souls shaped by (or at least understood in accordance with) the machines around them.8 Everyone by now realizes that electronic storage and retrieval sys- tems can supplant the printed page as the medium or element of written language. Computers are fast replacing pen and ink, and could literally replace the book, though that will not happen soon and may not happen at all. For the moment, however, the concrete change in technology is not the most important aspect of the so-called com- puter revolution for the study of literature. What matters most is the conceptual, social, and economic situation created by the computers and the sciences of information. In my fragmentary excursion into explanatory figures and models, I suggested that the "book as symbol" has been decisively replaced, first perhaps by the machine, certainly now by the computer. Note that in all cases I have been referring to the displacement not of literature but of the book. Papyri, printed books, and floppy disks are storage devices, and literature can be preserved and transmitted by any of them. But the status of literature is closely bound up with the status of writing and the book as the preeminent means of com- municating and saving what modern cultures have considered most important. The role of literature in education derives in no small part from the book's status as the principal and prestigious vehicle for communicating information. To master literature has been to master the book and the written word, and thus to master what are now often called the knowledge base and communications skills. Whether we like it or not, the use of computers in the study of literature is thus a curricular question, one that has to do with the</page><page sequence="4">294 NEW LITERARY HISTORY delicate matter of the (now largely indirect) vocational relevance of literary education. For the great majority of graduates who do not make careers in academia, writing and research skills have long con- stituted a crucial implicit curriculum of literary study. To the extent that instrumental, nonliterary writing and research are increasingly performed using computers and digital storage media, a literary cur- riculum that resists or trivializes this technology could lose a signifi- cant part of its covert but useful vocationalism, and thus inevitably lose students and cultural influence. Whitehead noted in The Aims of Education that the goal of literary education was to prepare individuals for decision making and command.9 He assumed, in other words, that literature constituted the cultural resources whose mastery trans- formed the individual mind into one fit to make decisions and to direct the actions of groups. Today, however, qualified decision mak- ers are often understood to be those who have access to vast data bases, usually quantitative in nature, and the skills to summon, select, and analyze this information. Put bluntly, the appropriately con- nected computer is supplanting the book as the primary resource or tool of the decider. It is also in a position to supplant the book as the primary resource of the literary scholar. Much literary writing and writing about liter- ature is now done on electronic media. Scholarship can now be pro- duced more efficiently, with less time spent on the retyping of drafts and the numbering of footnotes. It is not clear, however, whether the economics of higher education will permit an increased production of academic criticism-at least so long as by production we mean a pro- cess culminating in print publication--or, if so, what intellectual ad- vantages such increased output would offer. Word processing is but a modest first step in the adaptation of literary studies to new technologies of information processing. The MLA is working to provide on-line and CD-ROM bibliographic data bases; the Trisor de la langue franGaise and similar projects provide electronic access to significant portions of the textual archive. Thanks to optical readers, textual data bases, electronic mail, and desktop publishing, it is now possible to envision-without recourse to imag- inary technology-a complete workstation for the production of lit- erary scholarship. Its user could call to the screen, peruse, and selec- tively copy any text in the system. As Michael Heim wrote in his study of word processing, "by connecting a small computer to a phone, a professional will be able to read 'books' whose footnotes can be ex- panded into further 'books' which in turn open out onto a vast sea of data bases systematizing all of human cognition."'10 And the criticism</page><page sequence="5">COMPUTERS, MINDS, AND TEXTS 295 produced by such a well-connected scholar could instantly become a part of textual data bases consulted by others. Although we may never see the literary workstation pushed to this kind of extreme of self-sufficiency, it is no idle speculation. When university administrators talk about research in the humanities these days, they often emphasize technology-for example, electronic data bases and communications for the speeding up of literary scholarship.1' Carnegie-Mellon University and the Online Computer Library Center recently announced plans "to build an electronic li- brary to bring to a scholar's desk all the information needed for research projects."'12 It is therefore urgent to think critically about how literary studies might differ from other disciplines with respect to computerization. The Carnegie-Mellon proposal raises the question of the so-called "knowledge base." In the sciences this is taken to be a regularly up- dated body of generally recent technical information, the product of recent data-gathering (and data-interpreting) activities. The literary equivalent would be the MLA Bibliography and the materials indexed in it. This kind of material can be produced directly for electronic storage and access, although at present most literary scholarship is still printed. But in the humanities, the contemporary textual data base pales in comparison with the textual archive of the past, which can be made machine-readable only at considerable cost and after decisions have been made about what to include and exclude-decisions that would certainly raise the stakes of already heated arguments over canons. A substantial portion of the written past would be left be- hind-preserved in libraries, of course, but accessible only in a man- ner that could come to seem archaic or inefficient. Even the best possible electronic library of literature would not be without risks for scholarship. Books between their covers or poems on their pages are distinct things, experienced in their separateness. The passage from one book to another implies physical movement, the weight and feel of another object. This is the manner in which books have always existed for those who read and wrote them. Extensive literary data bases would create a new situation-the immediate link- ing and juxtaposition of texts whose authors and earlier readers knew them as separate books. The search for intertextual connections of all sorts, which has always passed through the memory of readers, aug- mented by notes and works of scholarship that must themselves be remembered, could be carried out with unprecedented speed and thoroughness. This kind of rapid access would surely give rise to some new and</page><page sequence="6">296 NEW LITERARY HISTORY interesting work. Yet it could also push scholarship even further to- ward ahistorical formalism. The context of criticism already seems to have become the community of critics and the stockpiles of texts in research libraries. This situation encourages critics to regard litera- ture as existing above all for them and their interpretive community; it does not particularly foster an understanding of literary texts as utterances situated in sociohistorical contexts. If and when we come to see FAUST and ULYSSES primarily as labels for text files that we bring together on a splitscreen, this process of decontextualization will only have advanced further.'3 The written past will take on a new exist- ence in an element quite foreign to the conditions of its production, a concretely realized and infinitely reproducible muswe imaginaire. The computer's mindlike attributes and information processing abilities equip it to begin encroaching not only on the book's territory but on that of author and reader. "Computer methods" in literary scholarship amount in general to a technologizing of the reader, in that computers perform part of the task of receiving, sorting, and regrouping textual features. This use of information technology has received much scholarly attention elsewhere, so I wish to turn briefly to the possible technologizing of the author and the literary artifact itself. The computer is by no means the first machine to have inspired speculation on the technologizing of literature or the displacement of the author. Here is an excerpt from the 1825 introduction to Scott's The Betrothed: Why, he is of the opinion, that at the expense of a little mechanism some part of the labour of composing these novels might be saved by the use of steam.... it is to be premised that this mechanical operation can only apply to those parts of the narrative which are at present composed out of com- monplaces, such as the love-speeches of the hero, the description of the heroine's person, the moral observations of all sorts, and the distribution of happiness at the conclusion of the piece. ... by placing the words and phrases technically employed on these subjects in a sort of framework... and chang- ing them by such a mechanical process as that by which weavers of damask alter their patterns, many new and happy combinations cannot fail to occur, while the author, tired of pumping his own brains, may have an agreeable relaxation in the use of his fingers.'4 Clearly this is to be taken as a bit of amusing outrageousness, and not as a realizable technical program. Yet for readers in the computer age, this text is perhaps not without some serious implications. First, the facetious argument for employing a machine in literature is none</page><page sequence="7">COMPUTERS, MINDS, AND TEXTS 297 other than the standard argument for mechanization in industry: the saving of labor through steam power. The newly dominant technol- ogy comes complete with a rationale for its use. Second, the possibility of mechanical production immediately implies a distinction between what could and could not be so produced. Third, this distinction is linked to an aesthetic preference for the human or nonmechanical, that is, for that which is original, unpredictable, irreducible to the iteration of commonplaces. Finally, the mechanical production of text is a matter of combinatorics, the production of variety by putting things together in new groupings. The possibilities of generating literary texts using combinatoric and algorithmic methods have been explored by a group known as the OuLiPo (Ouvroir de Litterature Potentielle), founded in France in 1960 by the mathematician FranCois Le Lionnais and the encyclopedic writer Raymond Queneau. For a demonstration of the sheer variety inherent in combinatoric composition, one need look no further than Queneau's Cent Mille Milliards de Poimes (One Hundred Thousand Billion Poems), in which the reader can choose from ten possibilities for each of the fourteen lines of a sonnet.15 The book's 140 lines thus contain 10'4, or 100,000,000,000,000, potential poems. Each of its ten text "pages" is cut into fourteen horizontal strips, so that by turning the strips the reader selects a line for each position and thereby sets up a sonnet that can be read in the usual manner. Obviously the possibilities of the book as format are being strained to the limit, and Cent Mille Milliards de Poedmes would be an ideal candidate for a com- puterized edition. When today's students encounter Oulipian texts, they spontane- ously believe them to have been produced with the aid of computers. One form which now seems to have a particular affinity with the computer is the lipogram, a text written without one or more letters of the alphabet. The best known example of such a work is Georges Perec's e-less novel La Disparition, in which characters vanish as they investigate the disappearance of the fifth in a series of twenty-six objects. The constraint of the vanished e even yields some startling rewritings of poems by Hugo, Baudelaire, Mallarm6, and Rimbaud. Here, as an example, is what happens to the first quatrain of Baude- laire's "Recueillement." Baudelaire's quatrain, Sois sage, 6 ma Douleur, et tiens-toi plus tranquille. Tu r6clamais le soir; il descend; le voici: Une atmosphebre obscure enveloppe la ville, Aux uns portant la paix, aux autres le souci.</page><page sequence="8">298 NEW LITERARY HISTORY appears in Perec's revision as: Sois soumis, mon chagrin, puis dans ton coin sois sourd Tu la voulais, la nuit: la voila, la voici Un air tout obscurci a chu sur nos faubourgs Ici portant la paix, IA-bas donnant souci.16 In A Translation of "La Disparition"for Anglo-Saxons, this might become: Submit, my sorrow, in your nook sit still You wish'd for night; it's falling, now it falls A darkling air has hid our city's hills, Now bringing calm, now bringing worry's thrall. Perec wrote La Disparition well before the era of word processing, but students are right to see the connection: the electronic thesaurus and keyboard modification to disable the excluded letter(s) are virtually made-to-order tools for the production of lipograms.'7 Italo Calvino, himself an OuLiPo member, discussed the possibility that computers might soon "author" literary texts in a 1967 lecture on narrative and combinatorics that has recently been translated as "Cy- bernetics and Ghosts." He explained why he viewed that prospect with serenity rather than anguish: "... literature as I knew it was a constant series of attempts to make one word stay put after another by following certain definite rules; or, more often, rules that were nei- ther defined nor definable, but that might be extracted from a series of examples, or rules made up for the occasion-that is to say, derived from other rules followed by other writers.... Writers as they have always been up till now are already writing machines; or at least they are when things are going well."'s Calvino shuttles here between lit- eral and figurative usage of the word machine, not to reduce the hu- man to the mechanical, but to find a way of talking about writing as an affair of composition in words rather than as a plumbing of psychic and spiritual depths. Unlike the steam engine of Scott's day, which seemed merely mechanical and antihuman, the computer interests Calvino not as a mere machine but as a mindlike machine. Despite traces in his talk of the overconfidence of the early years of AI re- search, Calvino was by no means wrong to foresee that computers create a new situation for the understanding of minds, their activities, and their productions. Computers are an unprecedented develop- ment in human culture, and they differ significantly from all previous models used to think about problems of mind, cognition, and the</page><page sequence="9">COMPUTERS, MINDS, AND TEXTS 299 production of symbolic artifacts. Unlike mere storage devices, the computer can process information; unlike simple processing devices such as mechanical governors and adding machines, it has speed and plasticity that make it capable of being used in many ways in a large variety of contexts. My thesis here is that computers and information technology are more important to literature as conceptual models and shapers of intellectual and social context than as concrete devices with immediate applications in the production, storage, and manipulation of texts. Neurobiology and AI are exploring aspects of mind, consciousness, and the generation and perception of patterns that have until recently seemed among the privileged objects of humanistic reflection. In lit- erary studies, meanwhile, much attention has been directed toward signifiers and their combination, and thus away from descriptions of literary experience that would be completely out of step with the world of information processing. An example of the ways in which thinking about computers over- laps with thinking about literature is provided by a familiar AI com- monplace, the Turing Test. In a 1950 article,19 the great British com- puting theorist Alan Turing made the following suggestion: to decide whether a computer program is intelligent, have someone carry on a conversation with it through a device such as a teletype. If the person can't tell whether he's conversing with a machine or a human being, then the program can be said to be intelligent. No program has yet passed the test to general satisfaction, but a number of programs can perform mildly convincing mimicry of human responses in restricted contexts: the ELIZA program, which mimics the responses of a psy- chotherapist to a "patient's" complaints, is a well-known example. The Turing Test requires intelligent or personlike behavior to be mani- fested strictly in written language. The problem is in effect an inter- active version of the kind of situation we encounter routinely in read- ing literature, most obviously (though not exclusively) with respect to effects of character in realistic novels. There is nothing there but text, yet the text's organization and conventions invite (or in some cases frustrate) the inference that complete individuals are being "represented" as if they existed. A similar situation arises when read- ers react to abstract, rhetorical/conceptual language. As Jean Paulhan pointed out in Les Fleurs de Tarbes, one reader may say "these are just words," while another reader will find in the same words a well- constructed argument.20 The divergence comes largely from the dif- ferent meanings that the readers associate with the words in question, but it amounts to one reader's decision to treat the text as a mere</page><page sequence="10">300 NEW LITERARY HISTORY string of (unintelligently produced) signifiers, and the other's postu- lation of a thinking mind behind them. Like computer programs, written texts are an exteriorization of mind, and all writing must, in some sense, seek to pass a Turing Test: the possibility that it may fail is a central factor in the suspicion and devalorization of writing.21 There are of course strong and worthy objections to the introduc- tion of terms and methods from computers and information theory into humanistic fields. There would be nothing to be gained, and much to be lost, in sacrificing the specificity of literary study by ex- pecting it to adopt quantitative methods because these are technolog- ically dominant. And there is no denying that the word information is sometimes no better than a thought-stopping cliche in public dis- course, or that educators have been known to embrace computeriza- tion without much serious thought about its real benefits and risks.22 Humanities scholars are not wrong to wish to preserve a part of the intellectual environment from overhasty assimilation to computer and information paradigms. One of the most serious objections concerns information technol- ogy's implication in the project of cybernetics, the science, in the words of its founding popularizer Norbert Wiener, of "control and communication in the animal and the machine."23 At the center of cybernetics is a generalization of the effects of feedback, or the use of the output of a process as an input to the same process. Feedback is the basis of simple process control devices like thermostats and gov- ernors, but is also assumed, by cyberneticians, to be a fundamental mechanism of much more complicated forms of biological, techno- logical, economic, and social self-regulation and adaptive behavior. In the words of its more sinister enthusiasts, cybernetics came to sound like an agenda for technological control and management of virtually everything, including human beings. For many, cybernetics, informa- tion theory, and computers are thus tainted by their association with the very real dangers of manipulative technocracy. David Porush has suggested that a major strain of postmodern fiction can be read as a resistance to the enclosure of the human within a cybernetic "servo- mechanical loop."24 He is certainly right to emphasize the ways in which literary works propose alternatives to reductive and manipula- tive forms of meaning, but his rejection of cybernetics not only as an ideology but as a concept leads him to write that "cybernetics threat- ens to deprive us of our sense of ourselves and authors of their au- thority. It would replace the mind with a brain, meaning with infor- mation, reading with information processing, the text with technique, uncertainty with closure, love with feedback loops."25 This denunci- ation derives its rhetorical force by embracing extremely traditional</page><page sequence="11">COMPUTERS, MINDS, AND TEXTS 301 terms and concepts (sense of self, authority, mind, meaning, love) that have long been the object of materialist, deconstructive, and psycho- analytic critiques that can hardly be reduced to technocratic ideolo- gies. To use a much criticized but heuristically useful opposition, there is "truth" as well as "ideology" in cybernetics. The sciences of information may often be used to pernicious ends, and their vocab- ulary may initially seem alarming or dehumanizing, but they are a major part of the intellectual equipment with which the real questions about human experience and culture that were concealed under the old essentialist terms can now be explored.26 The kinds of thought fostered by computers need not be reductive or technocratic. To be sure, the immediate and literal subjugation of literary studies to present-day methods of quantitative analysis would be a grim and gray disaster, but that is no reason to abstain from thinking with and about the sciences of information. What is unique and valuable in literary texts is not what can already be handled unproblematically as information, and what we can thus program "expert systems" to count up and put in order. What most interests us in texts, if recent critical activity is any guide, are the margins and complexities of their "messages." I have argued elsewhere that the ambiguities and undecidables of literature may usefully be under- stood as a kind of noise (in the information-theoretic sense of un- coded variety) that may incite readers to convert them into meaning- ful information through the creation of new contexts and connec- tions.27 In this sense the heuristic use of information and systems theory points not to the technologization of textual study but toward a renewed appreciation for the role of literature in interdisciplinary study and intellectual invention. Self-organization from noise, the capacity to turn hitherto uncoded variety into part of an enlarged pattern, is an attribute of cognitive and living systems, a formal property of certain highly complex in- formation processes. That this kind of phenomenon can be under- stood at all is a consequence of the theory of information and the possibilities of formal simulation offered by computers. There now is a branch of AI research, known as the new connectionism or neocon- nectionism or the study of neural nets, that should prove to be of greater heuristic interest to those of us in the humanities than any- thing the computers in our offices now can do. The neoconnectionists are attempting to build artificially intelligent systems not by modeling a logical approach to problem solving, as traditional AI has done, but by building parallel processing networks that imitate, however crudely at first, the architecture of the brain. These systems differ from familiar serial or Von Neumann architecture computers by their</page><page sequence="12">302 NEW LITERARY HISTORY ability to "learn" behaviors which have not been programmed into them, their capacities for associative memory, and their high level of fault tolerance, that is, their ability to function in less than perfect working order.28 A program known as NETtalk, for example, has achieved fairly good pronunciation of unknown English words after having been "trained" by exposure to a data base of sample pronun- ciations; no pronunciation rules are programmed into it.29 What pro- grams like this are beginning to offer are formal models of emergent behavior, systemic phenomena not reducible to or predictable from the qualities of system components.30 Since relations between part and whole occupy a fundamental place in the study of literature, and since the properties of texts are not generally held to be reducible to or predictable from the linguistic, generic, psychological, and cultural constraints and inputs out of which they arise, this kind of model is of enormous potential interest. Students and scholars of literature should be encouraged to under- stand computers and be aware of what is going on in the sciences of information, particularly artificial intelligence and its growing ties to neuroscience. We should all try a little elementary programming, not to accomplish anything concrete but to sense the difference between the underlying architecture of computers and the "user-friendly" en- vironments of our slick software. Computers offer and will continue to offer new ways to think about mind and pattern, which are constant concerns of literature. Beyond that, the arrival of the "information age," for what that term is worth, should incite us to think with new urgency of such fundamental issues as the use and value of the verbal past and the role of literature in the general economy of discourse.
