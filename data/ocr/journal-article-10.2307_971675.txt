<plain_text><page sequence="1">In this article I demonstrate the utility of an historical study of social change by examining the development of political authority on the Peruvian north coast during the Moche period through its symbols of power. We too often equate the mater- ial record with "archaeological culture,^^ assume that it reflects broad cultural realityX and interpret it by reference to gener- al evolutionary models. Here I reassess Moche society within its historic context by examining the relationship between underlying social structure and short-term processes that shaped Moche political formation, and reach very different con- clusions. I see the "diagnostic" Moche material record primarily as the symbolic manifestation of a distinctive political ide- ology whose character was historically constituted in an ongoing cultural tradition. Aspiring rulers used ideology to manip- ulate cultural principles in their interests and thus mediate the paradox between exclusive power and holistic Andean social structure which created the dynamic for change. A historic study allows us to identify the symbolic and ritual mechanisms that socially constituted Moche ideologyX and reveals a pattern of diversity in time and space that was the product of differ- ential choice by local rulers, a pattern that cannot be seen within a theoretical approach that emphasizes general evolution- ary or materialist factors. En este articulo demuestro la ventaja de un estudio historico sobre la integracion y el cambio social, a traves de un examen del caracter del poder politico en la costa norte del Peru durante el periodo Moche. Con demasiada frecuencia equiparamos el registro material con "las culturas arqueologicas "; asumimos que este refleja la realidad cultural amplia y la interpreta- mos con referencia a modelos evolutivos generales. En este articulo presento una evaluacion de la arqueologia Moche den- tro de su contexto historico, al examinar la relacion entre la estructura social subyacente y procesos de corta duracion que modelaron la formacion politica Moche, y llego a conclusiones muy diferentes. Veo a la arqueologia Moche solamente como la manifestacion de una ideologia politica distintiva cuyo caracterfue historicamente constituida dentro de una tradicion cul- tural continua. El elemento que dio forma a la ideologia Moche fue su cimiento basicamente andino, establecido en el con- texto regional de la costa nortena. Los aspirantes a gobernantes emplearon la ideologia para manipular los principios estruc- turales tradiciona les en su propio in teres y asi m ediar la paradoVa en tre el poder exclusivo y la estructura social holistica andina que constituyo la dinamica de cambio. Un estudio historico nos permite identificar los mecanismos rituales y sim- bolicos que socialmente constituyeron la ideologia Moche, y revela un modelo de diversidad en tiempo y espacio que no se puede ver dentro de una perspectiva teorica basada en la teoria evolutiva general.

Copyright t by the Society for American Archaeology Scholars are increasingly aware that the structure underlying early Andean social complexity incorporated a distinctive pat- tern of structuring principles (e.g., Moseley and Cordy-Collins 1990; Netherly 1984; Zuidema 1986). However, the implications of this insight for understanding social development have not been thoroughly explored, especially for pre- Inkaic societies. In these cases, general models of cultural evolution often provide the theoreti- cal framework for social explanation. Such mod- els emphasize increase of managerial complexi- ty, and general material causes of change. This approach tends to deflect study from mecha- nisms of social integration and change that are mentally constructed in the specific cultural experience of a society (e.g., Ohnuki-Tierney 1990). It has been so with the Moche "culture" of the Peruvian north coast (Figure 1), often described as a chiefdom or embryonic state. In this study I view Moche sociopolitical integra- tion as a product of a distinctive cultural tradi- 255 1 HE STRUCTURAL PARADOX: MOCHE CULTURE AS POLITICAL IDEOLOGY Garth Bawden</page><page sequence="2">256 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 6, No. 3, 1995 Figure 1.

Models of Moche Political Development Although recent fieldwork (AARG 1993a, 1993b; Alva 1988, 1990; Donnan and Cock 1986; Shimada 1976, 1978, 1990; Tschauner 1993; Wilson 1983, 1988) and iconographic research (Castillo 1989; Cordy-Collins 1992; Donnan 1978, 1988; Donnan and Castillo 1992; Donnan and McClelland 1979; Hocquenghem 1981, 1987; McClelland 1990; Quilter 1990; Schuster 1992) is modifying the database, the developmental scheme for the Early Intermediate Period Peruvian north coast (Figure 2) still depends largely on ceramic and settlement analysis generated from the Moche-Chicama-Viru "core area" (Bawden 1982a; Beck 1991; Donnan and Mackey 1978; Fogel 1993; Hastings and Moseley 1975; Kroeber 1925, 1926; Larco 1938, 1939, 1945; Moseley 1975; Moseley and Mackey 1974; Topic 1982; Willey 1953). As with most style-based chronolo- gies, the Moche sequence (Moche I-V:Figure 2) emphasizes temporal disjuncture, whereas the wide projection of ideas derived from a "core area" imposes an unreal pattern of spatial unity. The traditional model describes Moche society as evolving from antecedent Gallinazo culture around A.D. 1 to 100 (Figure 2; see Fogel 1993 for a somewhat later date), and in Moche III times establishing a conquest state supported by exploitation of labor, intensive agricultural pro- duction, and monopolization of trade (Shimada 1987; Topic 1982; Willey 1953; Wilson 1988). After recovering from major ecological disruption around A.D. 600 at the end of Moche IV (Moseley and Deeds 1982; Niles at al. 1979; Shimada et al. 1991), the state collapsed around A.D. 750 (e.g., Shimada 1990). As is common in studies of early society, the scheme sketched in the foregoing sen- tences associates change with material agencies that act through functionalist or adaptive process- es to produce a series of definable social stages. The value of such studies in creating our current databases is clear, but they have been less suc- cessful in identifying dynamics of social integra- tion and change. Newer evolutionary theories focus much more on the structure of political systems and the | COLONIAL PERIOD LATE HORIZON LATE INTERISIEDIATE PE R IOD 181 I DD L E HORIZON CO LONIAL INCA CHI ISIU _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 181 OCH E @s ll G AL Ll N AZO SALI NAR CUPISNIQUE 1500 V 1000 1 lV 500 A.

Chronology of north coast archaeological cul- tures. nature of the power that they embody (e.g., Earle 1991 a; Upham l 990a). Despite growing recogni- tion of variability, however, concepts of social typology continue to influence such research. While accepting the importance of ideology in the formation and maintenance of political systems, these approaches ultimately regard ideology as the means by which elites exploit their power, and they continue to ascribe the basis of political for- mation to the material domain (Claessen and van de Velde 1987, 1991; Daggett 1987; D'Altroy 1992; Earle 1991 a; Earle and D'Altroy 1989; Friedman and Rowlands 1978; Gregg 1991; Haas 1982; Haas et al. 1987; Hastorf 1990, 1993; Isbell 1987; Johnson and Earle 1987; Kristiansen 1991; Patterson 1991; Upham 1990b). The utility of evolutionary views is increasing- ly being questioned (e.g., Bawden 1989; Brumfield 1992; Demarest 1989; Hodder 1986; Leonard and Jones 1987; Paynter 1989; Roscoe</page><page sequence="4">258 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 6, No. 3, 1995 1993; Shanks and Tilley 1987; Wylie 1989; Yoffee 1993). There is no need to review this criticism fully here, but three points are relevant to this study. First, the use of social categories, no matter how sophisticated, inclines the scholar to investi- gate integration and change by reference to cross- cultural similarity. This approach downplays the importance of unique development. Second, func- tional models, still influential in Andean studies, assume systemic equilibrium as the objective of evolution and progressive complexity as the adap- tive mechanism by which this is achieved. Historic events that upset balance are viewed as anomalies and insignificant in wider evolutionary terms. The third point, which is especially relevant to my study, is the tendency to base evolutionary models on the relatively accessible material aspects of human culture. Although few scholars would deny the role of material agencies, their frequent use as the explanatory determinants of social integration and change has obscured the importance of less tangible factors that derive from the specific cultural experience of each human group. Prominent among such factors are the structurally based ideological systems through which interest groups negotiate their political advancement. In this paper I explore the role of the structural and ideological aspects of society during the Moche period, and reassess the historic development and political dynamics that charac- terized the north coast at this time. The Andean Basis of North Coast Social Structure Structure embodies the innate complex of shared values and rules that defines group psychology or "worldview," the relations between group mem- bers, and the responsibilities associated with such relations. It therefore sets the parameters for social action. Structure is historically constituted, and at its broadest extent defines the world's great cultural traditions. Within this broadly shared her- itage, specific cultural histories describe their own variants. Two important points should be made: first, although structure shapes, it does not determine social action by group or individual because a range of alternative actions is applica- ble to any situation; second, and closely related, action is not only constituted in structure, but, by negotiation in the social arena, reflexively changes it (Giddens 1979, 1984). In the political domain such negotiation usually occurs between conflicting interests, a dialectic interaction that is an important dynamic in social change. Andean social order is embedded in a structur- al tradition defined by kinship principles. Here such factors as affinity to mythical founder, ances- tral reverence, and emphasis on community mem- bership define status, strengthen social cohesion, and impede intergroup political integration. At the basic community level authority is exercised more through consensus than through exclusive political follllation. Consequently, elite power, by defini- tion exclusive in nature, must be constructed with- in a context that innately resists it; this creates structural paradox between what have been aptly termed holistic and individualizing ideology (Bloch 1992; Dumont 1980, 1986). It follows that the greater the paradox, the greater the potential for disruption should social stress imperil the abil- ity of elites to sustain their position. Within the greater Andean tradition the Inka masked power behind an ideology grounded in principles of genealogy and ancestry by present- ing themselves as a senior kinship group (Bauer 1992; Conrad and Demarest 1984; Urton 1990). Netherly's (1984, 1990; also Zuidema 1990) eth- nohistoric study of the Chimu successors of the Moche suggests that they were organized accord- ing to an extended segmentary system within which moieties of unequal status were nested hierarchically by rules of asymmetrical dual orga- nization while they retained their internal social integrity. Given the persistence of Andean social strategies it is quite likely that, despite the impact of conquest, this pattern generally reflects earlier structure. In both the Inka and the Chimu case the structural foundations of integration embodied paradox between holistic and individualizing forces that inhibited formation of strong, long- lasting political entities and ensured that their components would revert to autonomous exis- tence with the removal of the superstructure. I assume that the structure of earlier societies was also embedded in traditional Andean princi- ples and that Moche elites, like their Chimu suc- cessors, faced the challenge of creating individual- izing power within a holistic cultural milieu. I</page><page sequence="5">Bawden] MOCHE CULTURE AS POLITICAL IDEOLOGY 259 stress, however, that although these broader princi- ples provided the conceptual context for Moche political formation, they could not determine its specific strategies or course. These specifics were the products of discrete decisions by which Moche elites created a paradoxical dynamic of social change in which an ideology of power served to mediate structure and political enhancement. Ideology and Power Various overlapping meanings are ascribed to ide- ology in social studies (e.g., Althusser 1971; Bloch 1983; Bourdieu 1977; Conrad and Demarest 1984; Demarest 1989; 1992; Eagleton 199 l; Friedman and Rowlands 1978; Giddens 1979; Gilman 1989; Godelier 1978a, 1978b; Shanks and Tilley 1987; Valeri 1990). I focus here on ideology as the means by which the interests of certain groups are promoted relative to others through the perceived resolution of social opposi- tion, often with recourse to divine sanction (e.g., Foucault 1984; Gero 1985; Giddens 1979, 1981; Godelier 1988: 149-168; Gordon 1980; Gramsci 1971; Handsman and Leone 1989; Leone et al. 1987; Tilley 1989). In helping to sustain inequal- ity, ideology enters the domain of political rela- tions. Although initially actively created, ideolo- gy, if successful, becomes part of structure and embodies the beliefs of its cultural context while it is continually reconstituted as a dynamic mech- . &gt; anlsm ot power. It is important to realize that society is always in a state of transition. Internal tension, whether between the forces and relations of production, competing views of social order, or individual interest relative to that of wider institutions, spurs negotiation and change. Ideology as both cause and product of social imbalance cannot ultimate- ly possess greater inherent stability than the con- ditions it seeks to disguise. Hence, it is constantly adjusting to changing situations, whether to main- tain the position of the privileged, to confront opposing ideologies, or to mediate challenge by those whom it seeks to subordinate. When it can no longer resolve the contradictions presented by such situational challenges, breakdown in social process occurs. In the Andean political domain it appears clear that elites used ideology as a vital mechanism for the construction of power. Ethnohistory reveals that Inka rulers consciously translated traditional concepts into ideologies of authority in order to surmount the constraining effects of local belief systems (Conrad and Demarest 1984; Patterson 1991; Urton 1990). Similarly, archaeological research reveals the importance of ideological manipulation of concepts of descent and kinship by Chimu rulers (Conrad 1981,1990). These ide- ologies employed ritual enactment of mythic events and processes that underlay group integra- tion as the means of maintaining social order. By conducting these rituals, rulers and their political order identified themselves with the transcenden- tal quality of myth and the social permanence that it fostered. Material symbols played active roles in the above-mentioned political process. Symbols are active forces in ordering, interpreting, even recon- stituting reality, and resolve social contradictions by permitting humans to forge links with the structural events that give them group identity (Kurtz 1982:203). Such diverse symbols as dress, regalia, religious and funerary paraphernalia, rit- ual iconography, monumental public art, and the architectural contexts of power all act to articulate human leadership with the structural foundations of society. By so doing, material symbolism con- fers both mundane and supernatural status on elite leaders, closely identifies them with the founda- tions of social order, and legitimizes their exercise of power. Reassessing Uniformity and Diversity in the Moche Period Moche "culture" traditionally has been largely understood through archaeological research cen- tered in the Moche and Chicama valleys. The resulting scenario sees a discrete archaeological culture succeeding Gallinazo in this restricted "core area," and later spreading throughout the region as the material expression of a unified state. My reassessment of the evidence drastical- ly modifies this view by suggesting that there was no disruption in the north coast cultural tradition during the Early Intermediate Period. The charac- teristic Moche material complex was actually the symbolic manifestation of an influential political ideology that was differentially adopted by local</page><page sequence="6">260 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 6, No. 3, 1995 groups; north coast history of the Moche period was therefore far less uniform than supposed. Gallinazo-Moche Continuity A brief summary of the archaeology of Gallinazo- Moche transition suggests that regional culture remained essentially unchanged. It is difficult to distinguish Gallinazo from Moche platform mounds by form (Kroeber 1930:77; Lumbreras 1973: 100; Moseley 1992: 165; Strong and Evans 1952; Wilson 1988: 151), by construction because they share the segmentary technique that suggests community-based labor organization (Bennett 1950:68; Moseley 1975: 183; Willey 1953: 163), or by site context because they generally share the "ceremonial center" configuration (Fogel 1993; Topic 1982: 165). In agriculture, the extensive irri- gation systems that supported Moche populations derived from major Gallinazo-phase expansion (Willey 1953). Significant settlement disjunction between the phases was limited to the southern valleys (Willey 1953; Wilson 1988), a situation whose causes I discuss later. Other aspects of Gallinazo-Moche material culture also display continuity. Utilitarian ceram- ics are almost identical, and elite pottery also shares many formal features (e.g., Collier 1955; Larco 1966a; Lumbreras 1973:106; Strong and Evans 1952; see especially Fogel 1993). In metal- lurgy, copper-gold alloy, the basis of Moche tech- nology, became popular in the earlier period (Bennett 1950:101-103; Donnan and Mackey 1978:45-54; Strong and Evans 1952:71, 73). In the religious domain there are many continuities in burial practices (Fogel 1993:281-290), includ- ing the extended burial position, similar grave goods, and placement of copper in the mouth of the deceased (Donnan and Mackey 1978; Larco 1945 :25-28; Strong and Evans 1952:71 -79). Only in the area of elite art is there basic dis- continuity (Moseley 1992); a complex and formal iconography replaced the much plainer Gallinazo elite style (Fogel 1993:279). Various scholars have described the religious content of Moche art (e.g., Donnan 1978; Donnan and McClelland 1979; McClelland 1990; Quilter 1990). Iconography was restricted to such status symbols as fine pottery, textiles, and metal, and was used in broadly cere- monial contexts-elite burials and great platform complexes. Exclusive use of religious iconography in contexts of corporate authority and formal reli- gion clearly identifies it as a symbolic component of power. Continuity in many other aspects of reli- gious and corporate practice suggests, however, that Moche iconography and its related elite belief system were outgrowths of existing cultural con- ception, not cultural replacements. It follows that the art complex that has traditionally been regard- ed as marking Moche "culture" actually possessed its greatest significance as the symbolism of a political ideology growing out of the cultural tra- dition that formed its continuing context and gave . . t meanlng. North Coast Diversity during the Early Moche Period Having narrowed the meaning of elite Moche material culture to an ideology of power, I now propose to examine its emergence and develop- ment. The earliest Moche stylistic phase is found far more widely than emphasis on core area dis- tribution would suggest. Most prominent among numerous "peripheral" appearances is the far north Vicus complex (Figure 1), where early pot- tery (Larco 1966b; Lumbreras 1979) and ornate metal items (Jones 1979; Lechtman 1979) appear in the looted Loma Negra cemeteries, together with ceramic features that suggest distant connec- tions with Ecuador (Guffroy 1989; Kaulicke 1991; Lumbreras 1973:149) and the Peruvian southern coast (Larco 1966a:63-64). The Vicus Moche style (Lumbreras 1979:119-144) is dis- tinct from that of Moche and Chicama in terms of ritual iconography (Schaffer 1981), emphasis on metallurgy (Cordy-Collins 1992:Note 1; Jones 1979), and mass production of pottery jars from the same mold (Larco 1966a:84). Some scholars believe that the Vicus material reflects the presence of a distant Moche colony (Larco 1966a:87-88; Lumbreras 1979; Shimada 1987:135). Although this is certainly possible, it is important to note that Moche I and II material is increasingly being found in the Jequetepeque, Zana, and Lambayeque valleys (e.g., Shimada 1987: 131; Ubbelohde-Doering 1983 :Plate 63); recent work in the Lambayeque region even evokes the suggestion of a Moche I and II north- ern polity (AARG 1993b:19). Hence even if its</page><page sequence="7">Bawden] MOCHE CULTURE AS POLITICAL IDEOLOGY 261 origins were external rather than local, Vicus is most likely to have been a product of northern innovation that was succeeded by the elaborate Sipan (Alva 1988, 1990) and San Jose de Moro (Donnan and Castillo 1992) sites, whose burial symbolism differs markedly from that of the southern valleys. Moreover, Kroeber (1930:163) long ago noted and Shimada and Cavallaro (1986) recently reiterated that such northern platforms differ in form, location, and construction from their southern counterparts, a trait that persisted in later settlement configuration (Bawden 1977:359) Distributional studies support the evidence for diverse Moche origins and early development. They now indicate that Moche and non-Moche societies coexisted throughout the Early Intellllediate Period in the north (Kaulicke 1991; Schaedel 1951, 1985a:448; Shimada 1987: 132-133), not the pat- tern to be expected in a unified state. Also, as I have noted, the fact that there is better evidence for a dis- tinct Moche I-II presence in the north than there is in the supposed core area (AARG 1993b: 19; Fogel 1993), casts doubts on the latter area's generative role in broad political expansion. Indeed Fogel (1993) interprets the sparse early southern Moche material remains as indicative of tellllinal Gallinazo culture, at best transitional between it and Moche; only in Moche III is there clear evidence of strong Moche political presence in this area, a far cry from the picture emerging from recent work in the north. All this challenges simple evolutionary models of Moche origins and state formation. The Ideological Dynamic of Moche Historic Development Central to the ensuing discussion are two implica- tions of my assertion that Moche material culture was the symbolic component of political ideology. First, changes in the material record should denote ideological adjustment. Second, it follows that dynamics of social change during the Moche peri- od can be observed in the ideological domain. I apply these premises to explain the diverse nature of Moche development presented above. I focus on the Vicus Moche complex to study the internal structure of Moche political ideology, on the "flo- rescent" Moche III-IV phases in the Moche- Chicama area to portray the dynamic of change in this elite ideology, and on a more general discus- sion of Moche ideological response to stress in the final Moche V phase. By so doing, in the broadest sense I examine the reflexive relationship between short-term historic processes and social structure. More particularly, I use this interaction to explain the specific historic changes evident in the Moche archaeological record. Vicus as Ritual Signification The superb quality of Moche I metal objects from Vicus, including many of gold alloy, has raised doubts as to their date relative to pottery. The ulti- mate resolution of this issue awaits further study, but Lechtman et al. (1982:5) have elegantly addressed the apparent incongruence by asserting the structural priority of Andean metallurgical canons. The inherent qualities of gold imbued it with profound cultural significance in Andean thought. Gold possessed sacred import; its non- corrosive nature made it an ideal ideological sym- bol for the permanence of divinely ordered power (Sallnow 1989:222-223). It was so used by Inka rulers, who monopolized all gold production for this purpose (Harris 1989:258; Helms 1981; Sallnow 1989). Lechtman (1975: 8- 1 O, 1984:29-35) has proposed that the essential nature of gold shaped Andean metal technology, and explains the metal's importance even when painted or interred (Lechtman 1979:32). Superb Moche metal items probably also acted as sym- bols of divinely sanctioned power, a status that would explain their technical superiority relative to pottery in the Moche Vicus complex. Moreover, their presence in a funerary context would have separated the deceased from the gen- eral population and would have accorded them sacred status. The Vicus funerary inventory also possessed more particular ideological significance. The metal inventory included masks and other items that repeated specific themes, a reflection of the process of symbolic codification that is vital for general communication of a well-defined ideolog- ical system. Furthermore, headdress emblems were used to link their wearers iconographically to representations of specific rituals, the beginnings of the Moche practice of interring powerfill per- sons in the regalia of their rank and ritual status</page><page sequence="8">262 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 6, No. 3, 1995 (Donnan 1988; Donnan and Castillo 1992). Although several rituals are suggested in the Vicus material, the best-defined includes a figure hold- ing trophy head and knife (Jones 1979:96-100). On grounds of iconographic similarity (Cordy- Collins 1992:Figure 8; Jones 1979:Figure 37), I propose that this is an early version of the Decapitation Theme (Cordy-Collins 1992), a cere- mony concerned with ritual sacrifice. Sacrifice is a central and persistent theme in Moche ritual iconography. Sacrifice is an event that enables officiants, acting on behalf of their community, to acquire the vitality of outside forces through ritual violence in a setting charged with supernatural power where they themselves become spiritually transcendent (Bloch 1992). When they re-enter the mundane community, the sacralized participants retain aspects of their supernatural vitality that enhance their status and authority. Belief in the ability of a shaman to mediate directly with the spiritual world is a fun- damental feature of Andean belief. We can assume that, by taking the shaman's place, Moche elite transformed the ritual of sacrifice into for- mal religious practice. At the same time they used their control of this important ritual to acquire divinely sanctioned authority. A recurrent motif associated with the trophy head/sacrifice theme is the "Moon Animal" (Jones 1979:95), a religious symbol adopted from the adjacent highland Recuay Culture (Menzel 1977:62-64). The symbol is an example of adop- tion of a material signifier of ideas that tran- scended limitations of local belief systems as an adjunct of power. Whereas the "Moon Animal" exemplifies borrowing from a familiar nearby tra- dition, the Moche also used powerful symbols from their own religious history. For example, the Moche Decapitation Theme itself derived from earlier Chavin-related Cupisnique iconography (Cordy-Collins 1992), as did the fanged mouth, also a dominant symbol of the Chavin Horizon (Benson 1974; Kan 1972:81-84; Menzel 1977:61-62). Adoption of Cupisnique/Chavin motifs suggests the intentional manipulation of powerful symbols of an earlier pan-Andean ideo- logical system. Hence, to reinforce elite status, Vicus symbolism was used both to identify an elite with the supernatural ritual of Moche ideol- ogy and to harness in symbolic form powerful ideas that were distant in time and space and yet part of the north coastal cultural experience. The use of funerary ritual as a primary focus of ideological symbolism offers another avenue for understanding the structural basis of Moche ide- ology. Almost by definition, burial possesses important religious connotations. In Andean belief the treatment of the dead was integrally linked to kin-based principles of descent and the relationship between the living and their fore- bears. Whether at the community level (Bastien 1985; Sallnow 1987:128) or in the Inka royal cult (Conrad and Demarest 1984), funerary ritual played an essential role in Andean religious belief by making ancestors vital players in the affairs of the living. I propose that Moche elite burial prac- tice naturally embodied these Andean structural principles to create a spiritual context within which political ideology could be most effective- ly constituted by animating elite ancestors as vital supernatural forces for perpetuating the prevail- ing sociopolitical order. The Dynamic of Change: Individualizing Ideology in Moche III and IV I have noted that political ideologies are never sta- tic; they exist in a state of dialectic tension with antagonistic forces within their wider societies. Through active engagement with these forces the ideologies continually adjust, and, in the process, they reflexively affect social structure and stimu- late wider change. The Moche III-IV archaeolog- ical record illustrates this dynamic aspect of ide- ology. The well-known Moche-Chicama-Viru Valley "core area," location of the Huaca del Sol platform (the Moche site:Figure 1) and assumed center of an expansionist state, has traditionally been used to characterize Moche III-IV society as a whole, a danger that I have explored above. Important regional trends are apparent, but they vary locally in symbolic expression. I continue my contextual focus on funerary ritual here as a vehicle to study growth of the individualizing ele- ment in Moche ideology. Moche portrait vessels, variously interpreted as realistic depictions of individuals (Larco 1939) or symbolic images of shamans (Hocquenghem 1977), are among the best-known and admired</page><page sequence="9">Bawden] MOCHE CULTURE AS POLITICAL IDEOLOGY 263 and Chimu government centers (Isbell 1986:194; Schaedel 1985b:159-160). I propose that the via- bility of the southern Moche polity depended chiefly on the ability of its rulers to articulate in their own persons the combined authority of high social position, ritual status, and supernatural affiliation, through the codified symbolism of Moche ideology. Projection of the expansionist model to the entire north coast generated the idea of a unified Moche III-IV state. Examination of the record, however, shows that this view is untenable. Recent excavation of elite burial sites at San Jose de Moro in the Jequetepeque Valley (Figure 1; Donnan and Castillo 1992) and Sipan in the Lambayeque Valley (Alva 1988, 1990; Donnan 1988; Schuster 1992) reveals the persistence of local variation in Moche elite funerary practice. These two sites represent the only intact examples of such high-status burials, and hence compar- isons with the thoroughly looted Vicus and south- ern sites, known chiefly through private and museum holdings, must be made cautiously. Despite this preservational asymmetry, however, it is possible to identify certain differences between northern and southern patterns which suggest that the interred individuals of Sipan and San Jose were members of autonomous local societies, not provincial governors of a Moche Valleysentered polity. The Sipan and San Jose sites follow the gener- al Moche custom of burying elaborately accou- tred individuals with iconographic signifiers of their participation in the important Presentation or Sacrifice Ritual (Donnan 1988). However, they differ from Moche-Chicama practice by emulat- ing earlier Vicus emphasis on precious metal items for this purpose. In contrast, the southern- area inhabitants used the new and exquisitely crafted portrait vessels to designate status in funerary ritual. There is no evidence that such vessels were used at Sipan, San Jose, or in the Vicus area, whose large pottery inventories lack the quality and iconographic richness found in the southern valleys. Finally, at San Jose de Moro, the presence of Cajamarca and Nieveria pottery from the northern highlands and central coast respec- tively, together with lapiz lazuli from Chile and Spondylus shell from Ecuador (Donnan and expressions of New World indigenous art. They portray persons wearing headdresses that bear distinctive emblems. Two important points pro- vide the geographic and social contexts of their meaning: almost all known vessels have been recovered in the Moche-Chicama area, and were used exclusively in funerary settings (Strong and Evans 1952: 156). Portrait vessels repeat the Vicus practice of using headdress signifiers to link indi- viduals with specific ritual activity, now chiefly depicted in fine-line ceramic painting . The actors in these larger ritual scenes either are themselves divinities or assume supernatural quality through the masks that they wear (e.g., Donnan 1978, 1992:42; Quilter 1990:44). Formally, portrait vessels denote an extension of the ideological symbolic system and its mean- ing. I suggest that, in the Moche-Chicama Valley, Moche III political leaders succeeded in acquiring a greater degree of exclusive power than either their predecessors or northern counterparts. The question of whether the vessels were actual por- traits or not is less significant than the fact that symbols of social position were now so strongly individualized, a development that suggests pro- gressive differentiation of exclusive elite groups if not actual persons. This in turn indicates emer- gence of a domain of power less constrained by community sanction, together with its structural corollary increased potential for tension between individualizing and holistic ideology. This unprecedented consolidation of exclusive power accompanied coercion of the valleys from Viru to Hualllley into a Moche Valley-centered polity (Figure 1). Rapid southward spread of Moche artifacts and architecture, together with major changes in settlement and agricultural pat- terns (e.g., Donnan 1973; Willey 1953; Wilson 1988), constitutes the single clear body of evi- dence for the forceful replacement of Gallinazo political hegemony by the Moche. There is little sign, however, that the intrusive Moche III-IV southern ceremonial centers accompanied signif- icantly increased managerial differentiation. Largely absent in the architectural inventory are highly controlled corporate storage facilities, elaborate administrative complexes, military housing, and specialized craft sectors, all of which form such a conspicuous part of Moche V</page><page sequence="10">264 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 6, No. 3, 1995 Castillo 1992:42), suggests that the local elite exploited a wide distribution network as autonomous leaders. It would be surprising if there were not compe- tition among the local polities. Although the ten- sion is most clearly seen in the subjection of the southern Gallinazo sphere, it also appears that Moche polities fought among themselves, a prac- tice reflected in the common artistic theme of com- bat between warriors wearing identical Moche garb (see Donnan 1978:Figure 266; Kutscher 1955: 11, Figure). Given the frequent association of sacrifi- cial scenes with captive taking, both Donnan (1978:182) and Kutscher (1955:29) reasonably see combat as having played a major ritual role. This interpretation, with which I concur, has two impli- cations. First, the very custom intrudes an ideolog- ical requirement that other polities exist as ritual partners, a structural obstacle to political unity. Second, combat was an activity conceptually and practically integrated into a ritual complex cen- tered on the Presentation/Sacrifice Ceremony (Donnan 1978, 1988), and hence provided another visual referent to the principal sacralized actors of Moche ritual the elite. It appears that by Moche III-IV times several autonomous north coast societies existed, some adhering to Moche ideology while others rejected it. Moche societies ranged in size from the large Moche III-IV multi-valley southern polity with its center in the Moche Valley, probably organized on segmentary principles (Moseley 1975), to smaller northern examples that may not have con- trolled the entire valleys in which they were locat- ed (Bats 1991; Hocquenghem 1991; Schaedel 1985a:448; Shimada 1987: 132-133). Through several centuries of local development, Moche societies created diverging political and symbolic systems; differentiation in the latter sphere shows that, while sharing most ideological precepts, local elites used different means of communicat- ing this basis of their power. Moche III conquest of the south must have increased the demands on central authority. However, this challenge was addressed primarily by ideological adjustment rather than administra- tive differentiation, a process dependent on fur- ther enhancement of elite power through funerary and political ritual whose extreme symbol was the portrait vessel. Individualization of authority would have further separated the ideology of power from its holistic cultural origins, and thus increased the potential for social tension should authority no longer be perceived as serving the general interest. Around A.D. 600, in the context of regional crisis, the efficacy of Moche political ideology was apparently so tested, with resultant structural crisis and transformation. Ideological Response to Stress: Collapse Revisited The well-known basic framework of the Moche IV-V transition included Moche expulsion from the southern valleys (Figure 1), abandonment of the "capital" at the Huaca del Sol, establishment of the inland urban settlements of Galindo and Pampa Grande at the valley necks (Figure 1), abandonment of previously cultivated land, and major changes in the iconography of elite art (e.g., Bawden 1982a:287; Moseley 1992:213). The transformation has variously been ascribed to Wari invasion (Menzel 1964; Schreiber 1992:274-275; Willey 1953:397), internal breakdown (Bawden 1982a, 1982b), and environmental perturbation (Craig and Shimada 1986; Moseley and Deeds 1982; Moseley and Ortloff 1981; Niles et al. 1979; see especially Shimada et al. 1991). Whereas these changes have usually been viewed as reflections of unitary, pan-regional, state collapse, I now pro- pose that they were the differential expressions of local response to disruption, and that they depict the complex nature of Moche ideological adjust- ment. I trace this process through Moche V funer- ary, iconographic, and settlement data. Iconography In Moche V many of the key figures of earlier rit- ual iconography disappeared, to be replaced by new ones or, as in the case of the Presentation Theme, used in innovative contexts (Bawden 1983:231-233; Berezkin 1980, 1983; Donnan and McClelland 1979; McClelland 1990; Quilter 1990). Following other scholars, I regard the Revolt/Presentation/Burial/Raft thematic series as a mythic cycle asserting the triumph of order over chaos (Berezkin 1980; Quilter 1990). Myths, like structure, are not changeless. They embody persis- tent ideas that underlie the relationships of people with their wider temporal and spatial universe. However, they also resolve particular structural</page><page sequence="11">Bawden] MOCHE CULTURE AS POLITICAL IDEOLOGY 265 contradictions of their society and hence necessar- ily incorporate interpretational flexibility (Bloch 1992:99; Levi-Strauss 1955; Obeyesekere 1992:1&gt;15). It follows that myths are constrained by time, and address major historical problems and events (Obeyesekere 1992; Sahlins 1985). I suggest that the Moche V mythic cycle reflects ideological adjustment in response to ter- minal Moche IV disruption, and is an example of the ritual form commonly used to promote social renewal (e.g., Bloch 1992). The focal Presentation Theme offered historic continuity and symbolized acquisition of vitality from the defeated forces of disorder portrayed in the Revolt Theme through the medium of sacrifice conducted by elite offi- ciants. The Burial Theme depicts further transfor- mation signifying re-entry of the sacralized offi- ciants into the community, bearing spiritual power that reinforced political authority in the mundane world. Finally, the Raft Theme shows the arrival of the two central divinities of the Presentation Theme from exotic maritime sources (McClelland 1990). They symbolize renewal by bringing with them valued commodities that include the sacrificial prisoners vital for the ritual reconstitution of Moche V society. One other major iconographical change indi- cates the reality of ideological adjustment. Portrait vessels, symbols of the triumph of indi- vidualizing ideology, abruptly disappear from the Moche ceramic tradition. Their elimination is a major indicator of the rejection of the ideological complex in which they were central players, fol- lowing broad economic and political collapse. Funerary Ritual In the important area of funerary ritual diverse local change occurred in Moche V In the Jequetepeque Valley elite burial practice demon- strates general continuity (Disselhoff 1958; Donnan and Cock 1986; Ubbelohde-Doering 1951, 1983) by following earlier patterns of extended cemetery and mound burial. Elsewhere change is much more pronounced. Neither Galindo nor Pampa Grande, the best-known Moche V towns, possesses formal cemeteries, a major break with convention. The means of burial at Pampa Grande has yet to be discovered, but three innovative types of burial have been found at Galindo in the rump southern polity (Bawden 1977:362-377). They include modest in-house burial and groups of chamber burials whose loca- tion within a town is otherwise unknown in the Moche period, as well as a single small burial platform (Bawden 1982a:293-296; Conrad 1974). Moreover, a large proportion of the dead were buried in semiflexed side position. The mag- nitude of these innovations in a social domain imbued with supernatural significance clearly marks profound religious change. Settlement Moche V settlement survey reveals that, apart from loss of the valleys from the Viru Valley south, the overall Moche settlement distribution remained much the same, comprising the entire Moche, Chicama, Jequetepeque and Zana Valleys (Figure 1) and the middle parts of the valleys far- ther north (Eling 1987; Schaedel 1985a; Shimada 1990:334-5), where non-Moche polities also per- sisted (Schaedel 1985a:448e49). However, data from the Moche V towns of Pampa Grande (Anders 1981; Haas 1985; Shimada 1976, 1978) and Galindo (Bawden 1977, 1982a, 1982b, 1983; Moseley and Ortloff 1981; Topic 1991) clearly support iconographic and burial evidence for change. Located in the valley necks in order to control the main canal intakes and maximize agri- cultural capacity that had been significantly diminished during the ecological crisis of late Moche IV times (Moseley and Deeds 1982:38-39; Shimada et al. 1991), these towns introduced an urban pattern of unprecedented complexity and administrative differentiation. The economic disruption reflected by such major adjustments would have been greater at Galindo than in the north. The small Moche Valley was previously the core of a large polity that drew on the resources of the subjected southern valleys (Willey 1953; Wilson 1988:335-336). With the Moche IV disruptions not only was this entire eco- nomic sphere lost but also the southern part of the Moche Valley itself fell out of production (Moseley 1983). This massive economic blow was probably magnified by the need to support settlers ejected from the southern valleys. In contrast, although it is clear that significant reduction of agricultural capacity did occur in the north (Shimada et al. 1991), it was not compounded by loss of political control over large areas.</page><page sequence="12">266 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 6, No. 3, 1995 Local response reflected such differential impact. The substantive Galindo innovations have been described elsewhere (Bawden 1982a, 1982b, 1983, 1990). The platform, architectural focus of social integration since the early Gallinazo period, virtually disappeared, to be replaced by a new walled enclosure form (Bawden 1982a). Corporate storage, probably intended for subsis- tence goods, reflects important economic innova- tion in the face of food shortage (Bawden 1982a:304-306). Residential occupation was highly differentiated (Bawden 1982b), with the lowest privileged group formally segregated by a massive wall that may originally have been built for defence during the disruptions that attended the town's founding (Topic 1991). The much larger Pampa Grande, often consid- ered the capital of a late Moche state, is more fea- sibly explained as the product of local northern response to pressure. The town far exceeds all contemporary Moche V settlements in its urban qualities. Dense residential occupation surrounds a vast corporate precinct whose formal complexi- ty suggests highly differentiated managerial structure. However, the fact that residential class- es were not segregated as at Galindo implies less social stress. Extensive craft-production areas are located in the corporate precinct (Shimada 1976, 1978). A large area of corporate storage displays a high degree of standardization, excellent con- struction quality, and restricted access. Most sig- nificant, the central precinct comprises a complex of enclosures and platforms dominated by the Huaca Fortaleza (Haas 1985), one of the largest edifices ever built in the Andes. Displaying the distinctive chamber-and-fill technique and formal proportions characteristic of the northern part of the region (Shimada and Cavallaro 1986), the edi- fice stands solidly in the north coast platform tra- dition, its awesome size and ideological meaning proclaiming the dominant authority of its builders, a situation that contrasts vividly with Galindo. The Nature of Moche V Political Reconstitution In response to collapse, Moche V ideological structure underwent major adjustment. A new mythic cycle that combined traditional and innov- ative elements mediated past disruption through ritual transformation and renewal. However, while this adjustment was probably a major factor in allowing temporary recovery on the regional level, local political strategies reflect deepening social contradiction that heralded further crisis. The rulers of Pampa Grande created an organi- zational system of unprecedented complexity. In light of the holistic worldview of north coast peo- ples, this further concentration of power may well have laid the foundations for further social ten- sion. In the short term, however, it effectively sus- tained political cohesion. The basis of recovery is revealed by its great symbol, Huaca Fortaleza. Bearing murals that proclaimed the ideological core of power, this huge platform manifests the ability of the local elite to construct power by har- nessing the force of cultural continuity embodied in symbolic form. By using this powerful symbol of traditional north coast administrative organiza- tion as the integrative focus of a complex urban system, the Pampa Grande elite effected a struc- tural transformation and appropriated exceptional political control. The Moche Valley situation is very different. Here Moche IV leaders developed individualizing ideology to an extreme degree in the absence of a complex administrative system, thereby centering social integration on their personal qualities. By so doing they augmented structural paradox, and posed the danger that failure would be solely ascribed to them and their ideology. As a result of the late Moche IV crisis and loss of the southern territories, the system collapsed. In an attempt to restore control, Moche V leaders rejected the dis- credited ideology together with its material sym- bols. At Galindo, their attempts are vividly seen in the material record. Burial practice was trans- formed. Iconographic changes, greater than those that occurred farther north (Bawden 1977, 1987), included elimination of the portrait vessel, the symbol of individualized Moche IV power. Moreover, no evidence of the Moche V mythic cycle has yet been found. New architectural forms without historic meaning replaced platform mounds as dominant symbols of the new order. A single burial mound complex suggests a supreme ruler without counterpart or successor. Furthermore, an extreme degree of imposed resi-</page><page sequence="13">Bawden] MOCHE CULTURE AS POLITICAL IDEOLOGY 267 dential segregation indicates that the changes occurred in the context of social stress and struc- tural change (Bawden 1990). 1 suggest that these varied responses were his- torically shaped. There is no evidence in the Lambayeque area of the political disjunction expe- rienced by the south. The rulers of Moche V Pampa Grande were therefore able to base their organizational changes on traditional structure, and restore economic strength in more favorable conditions than their southern counterparts enjoyed. Northern crisis did not discredit historical signifiers of power, and ideological continuity played an important role in political recovery. At Galindo, however, in the context of profound polit- ical stress rulers rejected the political ideology that had sustained power. The archaeological picture suggests an ensuing state of instability in which an embattled elite ruled a highly stratified population largely through coercion. Power here seems unmasked by ideology and the structural paradox appears even greater. It follows that, with the struc- tural foundations of society eroded, the Galindo polity was even more vulnerable to complete col- lapse at the next major crisis. Ironically, with the complete removal of structural restraint on power and what can superficially be construed as the tri- umph of individualizing ideology, Moche Valley society was at its weakest and ripe for the extreme dissolution that occurred in little over a century. Postscript By A.D. 750 the Moche V cities of Galindo and Pampa Grande were abandoned and a distinctive Moche symbolic complex had ceased to exist as the dominant expression of north coast material culture. However, as with its history, the end of Moche culture was not as uniform or complete as often believed. Abandonment of Galindo accompanied total disintegration of the Moche Valley polity. Settlement reverted to a rural pattern until the emergence of Chanchan well over a century later. It is significant that the long-abandoned Huaca del Sol was renewed as the site of ritual activity related to foreign Wari-related ideology (Menzel 1977; Uhle 1913). These events marked the final collapse of an ideology and its related political system. Having become so disconnected from its structural base, Moche ideology in the south ceased to possess structural meaning and disap- peared from history. The Moche Valley popula- tion returned to a system of self-dependent social groupings, the usual response of Andean popula- tions to the removal of central political super- structure, a situation that was repeated at the fall of the Chimu polity. Wider religious focus natu- rally moved to the transcendental Wari religion, and articulated it with the powerful aura of the ancient Huaca del Sol while rejecting all sem- blance of Moche ideology. In the north where Moche V changes were grounded in cultural tradition, the end of the peri- od did not involve such deep disjunction. Hence although urbanism, in its role as response to struc- tural crisis, disappeared as quickly as it did farther south, the Lambayeque Valley inhabitants contin- ued to erect large ceremonial centers whose mixed Moche-Wari iconography signaled transition from Moche into the later Sican (Lambayeque) phase rather than transformation (Bonavia 1985; Donnan 1972; Shimada 1990:313). In this respect there obviously had been no deep break, with the Huaca Fortaleza at Pampa Grande maintaining cultural continuity through the Moche V period. Here Moche ideology had not divorced itself so completely from structure, and it appears to have played an important role in the transition to Sican. Conclusions Conventional scenarios of Moche political devel- opment have stressed a temporally and spatially uniform evolutionary pattern that is not supported by the diverse archaeological record. I believe that more specific focus on social construction and change allows better understanding of historic process and its internal dynamics. I have therefore reassessed Moche culture from a historic view- point by examining the relationship between underlying north coast social structure and the shorter-term processes and events that shaped Moche polities. I have conducted the study through the agency of material symbolism, which I regard as a sensitive indicator of Moche political development. I believe elite Moche material cul- ture to be the symbolic component of political ide- ology that gave objective meaning to the precepts that defined it as a source of power. It follows that</page><page sequence="14">268 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 6, No. 3, 1995 by studying variation in the symbolism one can identify regional diversity and change in political structure. Moche political ideology and symbolism, irre- spective of local variation, acquired social signif- icance within a structural system in which perva- sive principles of kinship, ancestral reverence, and the centrality of direct spiritual mediation in religious practice provided its persistent internal logic of meaning. Such group-focused, holistic ideation was a structural obstacle to the growth of exclusive power, and it encouraged local autono- my against broad political union. Local rulers met this challenge by placing themselves at the axis of social structure and organization. They achieved this by assuming central roles in the enactment of myths of communal order, thereby ritually identi- fying themselves in life and death with the omnipresent spiritual forces of society. They thus constructed political ideology according to the constraints of structural meaning. However, by achieving a large degree of exclusive power they created contradiction between holistic and indi- vidualizing ideology. This structural paradox pro- vided a dynamic for further ideological adjust- ment and related social change. At the same time it raised the potential for internal social crisis. Structure constrains but does not determine action. Within the constraints individuals always have alternatives open to them. Their chosen course of action is given meaning by structure, but also reflexively influences it and thereby cre- ates a force for change. The significant variation evident in the symbolism of Moche power through time and across space vividly illustrates this process of choice. Thus, throughout the course of Moche history, we see fundamental dif- ference in cultural form and symbolic use between north and south. However, this difference was not merely one of passive cultural diversity. It also represents the active production of discrete historic courses through the conjuncture of short- term process and persistent structure, differential- ly mediated through unique social practice. The natural corollary of this process was the develop- ment through time of different local political strategies and histories within the greater Moche ideological sphere. Finally, this study of the Moche suggests that the various levels of integration within a cultural tradition experience different forms and rates of change, a notion that generally accords with Braudel's multiple time-scale scenario (e.g., Braudel 1980; see also Knapp 1992). Hence although structural change ensued Eom reflexive interaction with social practice over the long term, it occurred within a context of consistent meaning. In contrast we have noted that both symbols and their meaning are subject to more abrupt modifica- tion at times of major short-term historic change, whether generated Eom inside the system as part of the political aspirations of Moche III ruling elites, or produced in response to the wider social disruptions of Moche IV-M It is clear that pro- found short-term social disruption occurred con- currently with deeper structural and cultural conti- nuity. Only in the Moche Valley during Moche V do we see radical disjuncture of structural mean- ing, total collapse of sociopolitical superstructure, and disruption of the very tradition of social con- trol of which it was part. This was, of course, the culminating consequence of the structural paradox inherent in Moche political formation. In conclusion, I believe that study of material culture in its filll historic context can facilitate recognition of important social dynamics that might not be considered within a materialist evo- lutionary model. Moreover, the study of cultural meaning through material symbols informs us of the significance of these mechanisms for under- standing the deeper structural fabric that con- structs both political ideology and culture itself.
