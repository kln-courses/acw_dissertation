<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ascent of Humanity. By GERALD HEARD. London: Jonathan Cape, 1929. Pp. xiv + 332. 15s. THE purpose of this book is to display the evolution of the body- mind of man as involving a passage from a relatively unindividualised condition to full individualisation and then on to a condition ana- logous to, but different from, the first. It contains, therefore, an interpretation of the whole of history, seen like a landscape from an aeroplane as having a pattern which escapes us when we are too close to it. The first problem that confronts us, before we start on our journey, is that of progress. Every discussion on this subject is held up by the remark: " It depends what one means by the word 'Progress ". That is to say, there are nowadays two problems and not one. On the one hand you have the problem of progress, and on the other the problem of the idea of progress. This pre-occupation with different ideas of progress is characteristic of a psychologically-visioned age, If anyone is asked whether mankind is progressing, by which must be meant not the sophisticated 'mere alteration of state,' but alter- ation in a certain direction which involves more ' good,' he will answer according to his lights. In an age when the subjective view of ethics was not current the light will seem to lie outside, and the basis of comparison may be agreed upon; but we are landed with serious difficulties when it dawns on us that the light in accordance with which we-make our judgments is shining out of our own eyes and that we,see things ' couleur de si6cle '. It is then that progress gives place</page><page sequence="2">212 CRITICAL NOTICES: to the idea of progress. The question may be attacked in three ways: (1) We may ask outright: ' Is there more good in the world now than before and is there a likelihood of there being still more? ' (2) We may ask: 'What sorts of things can have the quality' good,' and are there more of such things now ?,' or (3) 'What means may be cal- culated to produce an increase of good things, and are we reaching a state of affairs when such means are more and more ready to hand ? ' I do not pretend that these are independent questions; they are obviously very closely related and in practice are all asked at once, or else answers are assumed to some of them. If happiness is said to be good, and if the economic stability of each individual can be shown to be productive of happiness all round, then thel question is whether we are moving in the direction of such econ- omic stability. Difference of opinion with respect to the idea of progress means that people will differ about the second and third questions, both as to their meaning and as to the answers which are appropriate. They will differ as to what is meant by saying that a thing is good, as to what things really are good (if any) and as to the means whereby such things are produced. If it is held that happiness is good, and that happiness is a state in which our desires are satisfied, it might be argued that we should be equally satisfied whether we wanted what we got or got what we wanted. An important question is now raised: why do people differ ? The answer given by Mr. Heard is that their views on progress will be a reflection into a desirable future of a state of disequilibrium in the present; mankind evolves and (p. 6) " Progress is disclosed as a novement in the human mind, a standard which as it changes, gives an accurate path of the evolution of man's consciouisness ". Now this would seem to be leading up to the subjectivist conclusion that progress is not real, but a phantom bait which alters with the state of our digestions. This, however, does not appear to be the case. He notes that there is a tendency to despair because economic and political advance do not seem to be the means for producing satis- faction-perhaps, indeed, there are no such. means. Mr. Heard interprets this condition as being due to the fact that thinkers " Ob- sessed with economics and suspicious of psychology . . . take the individual to be final and insoluble ". This might mean that the present age has not projected any idea of progress, either because disequilibrium is so acute, or because knowledge and insight are lacking, granted that equilibrium itself has not set in. But Mr. Heard wishes to go farther than this; it is not merely that we have not created a phantom, we have not seen the truth. We are promised (p. 6) that the individual " will now be driven by the fact of his own unresolved individuality (no more an End in Itself than the State) to create a community in which he may resolve himself, compassing a real progress from the original co-consciousness (out of which his individuality originally condensed) through the painful transition that is individuality, to the superconsciousness of a purely psycho-</page><page sequence="3">GERALD HEARD, The Ascenzt of Humantity. 213 logically satisfying state ". It would seem that the troubles are due to the painful transition and to the lack of recognition of its tran- sitoriness, and that when individuality is ' resolved ' we reach a satisfying state and, according to Mr. Heard, this is real progress. It is hard to see exactly what is meant by a 'purely psychologically satisfying state '. Is it a state of desirelessness ? or a state where we want what we get ? or a state in which we think we get what we want ? When you have classed progress among the subjective phenomena it is not altogether safe to use the word 'real ' in connexion with it. Why should this state which is described as a real goal be more than a projection symptomatic of Mr. Heard's own condition? All he might be able to show is that the idea of progress is an indication of tension between what we have and what we need, that as our needs alter our ideas of progress will alter, and that mankind develops in such a way that the tension becomes less and less until the idea of progress vanishes-in the complete satisfaction of the organism. If you look at one end of the series and prefer it to the middle you are merely projecting desires symptomatic of your age on to the concept you are contemplating. On page 5 Mr. Heard says that the idea of progress when it arose was necessitated by "-the new sense of individuality . . . now for the first time become conscious ". The tension in fact is partly a function of the conflict between the individualist urge and the cohe- siveness of the group, and in a masterly way Mr. Heard proceeds to trace the growth of individualism out of the primitive unindivid- ualised mass. He displays great learning, and has an astonishing selective technique at his command. In the first chapter he collects together a certain amount of the evidence for co-consciousness. He points out that existing scarcely individualised tribes have themselves a long history of their own and can only be taken to be like primitive man if we suppose that they have been pushed off from the centre of human diffusion into circumstances where their development was arrested either because nature was too kind or too cruel, and that we must be careful when we draw inferences from their conditions to the conditions appertaining among our remote ancestors. Two main arguments are put forward to support the hypothesis of co-consciousness. One is the usual heuristic argument that much that was puzzling in the behaviour of backward peoples is clear if we accept some such hypothesis, the other is that in nature ' all growth tends to be spiral,' evidence for which is unfortunately assumed, to be known, and which seems to mean that certain qualities of or- ganisms, e.g. size, alter in a certain direction up to a point and then alter in a reverse direction. . It is assumed that such a law dominates human evolution with respect to individualism; and Mr. Heard is perhaps carried away by a too vividly spatial form of ideation when he suggests that we are now on the return curve of the spiral and as it were look down on primitive peoples from a position more immedi- ately above them than was the case with our fathers, which means</page><page sequence="4">214 CRITICAL NOTICES: that we can know more about them. In fact our co-conscious theory is a symptom of our development towards a new co-consciousness. " To-day," writes Mr. Heard (p. 33), " for the first time, civilised, self- conscious, critical man is able to recognise a pre-individual condition, and the fact that he can so recognise it is evidence of an evolution in himself which has carried him whither he can perceive that in- dividuality is not final, that other states lie behind him in the past and may await him in the future," whereas (p. 25) " a generation ago . . . the observers saw little but the distorted reflection of themselves." The epistemological pit gapes before us. Why should our vision be any the less distorted ? A very important point is made, of course, but not so much in support of the theory as to show how dangerous it is to accept it as more than useful. As Mr. Heard elsewhere (p. 31) says: "iRealising the distorting rationality (that they assume themselves to be norms of consciousness) of researchers, we ought to decide . . . in favour of oddness, against the limited distorting fancy of 'making sense However, accepting the hypothesis of primitive co-consciousness, Mr. Heard spreads the map of history before'us and brings order and intelligibility into the vast confusion. It would be hard to exaggerate his skill in bringing such an immense amount of material into so small and so admirably organised a canvass. He writes brilliantly, his grasp is sure, and he shirks none of the difficulties, of which per- haps the greatest lies in the fact that evolution does not occur con- tinuously but in jerks. There are set-backs, apparent regressions, and periods during which nothing seems to be happening at all. First comes the ambiguous proto-individual-the priest king- embarrassed and almost detested because of his peculiarity. He is often reduced to offering himself as a sacrifice to satisfy his ambi- valent attitude to society. With growing strength he, or rather his spiritual descendants, take to conquest. Kingdoms are formed with offices, religious and lay, to be filled by developing individuals, while occasionally the fore-runners fail to find satisfaction on earth and take refuge in a personal religion of survival. Empires crumble because they cannot support the strain of a fissured state, and con- ditions become unfavourable for further development; but once it has made its appearance individualism has altered the pattern of the universe for later comers. More and more individuals will be pre- cipitated, more and more places will have to be found for them, the familiar themes of priest-king and hero will be repeated but in different media, and a time will come when there are so many individualised organisms that society will have to invent a monastic system to protect itself by shutting them up. Society is taken to be an organic unity with a stability of its own, to preserve which it will automatically take measures against any element which is likely to upset its equilibrium. I But as the stream of individuals increases, as the principle of separation affects more and more organisms, the advance guard are</page><page sequence="5">GERALD HEARD, The Ascent of Humantity. 215 endowed with a new interest; suddenly (p. 199) " at the beginning of the seventeenth century we are faced with a new force as positive as intelligence and at the same time instinctive in its blindness and strength," and Humanitarianism makes its appearance. The ' upper individuals ' " are already re-expanding toward a consciousness larger than individuality ". The leaders develop an interest in other people's welfare, pity them, and go out of their way to help them, and their very interest in others than themselves leads them to help hatch out 'lower individuals' of our own age-the age of revolutions. The masses are becoming more and more individualised, the more advanced are acquiring more and more interest in matters not pri- marily concerned with their own personal welfare. There is ample evidence of the former in the excessive sensitivity of the working classes about their own individuality, and their preoccupation with its integrity, though of course they are superficially influenced by the humanitarianism with which they are surrounded. The question is whether the new interests can be properly described as ' consciousness larger than individuality'. It is not a mere quibble, because it is just this change in consciousness which is under discussion; it is not merely that the expression is used in a popular sense. And, furthermore, inference is drawn from the change which was first apparent in the seventeenth century to the probable state of mankind in the future. Co-consciousness is the name given to a hypothetical condition of consciousness in which the nail of a man is seen as a vulnerable part of the man himself, in which the unit of counting is, say, a hand's worth, in which collective decisions are taken without the steps usual in civilised meetings, and in which the individual is not aware of him- self as apart from his group but is so identified with it that he feels misfortunes and adventures which happened to another as having happened in some way to himself. What that is like we cannot say. The point is that the world is supposed to look different, and we infer the look of the world from the behaviour of the organism we are studying-obviously a dangerous procedure. But the fact that we cannot remain unmoved in the presence of other people's misery, does not mean that we are conscious of them in a different way from the way in which we were conscious of them when we were indifferent to them. Now we are prompted to help them, then we were not, but our present view of them is in no way analogous to the mysterious unimaginable condition which is named 'co-conscious'. In our hypothesis concerning primitive man we are making two sugges- tions-one is that he had a different mode of consciousness, and the other that the pull of the group was stronger. When individuality emergesA'the pull of society becomes weaker (possibly owing to re- latively stable conditions) and the change which is called a change in consciousness is really a gradual return of the pull of society, which can leave the mode of consciousness unaltered. In the last two chapters Mr.- Heard brings together evidence for</page><page sequence="6">216 CRITICAL NOTICES: those changes of interest which he thinks point to a change of con- sciousness. Of course it would be admitted that I shall interpret that of which I am aware in a way dependent on my interests, but the interpretation may very well be experienced in the same way as alternative interpretations, unless that of which I am conscious be identified with consciousness, which certainly does not seem to be the position which Mr. Heard either can or wishes to take up. The first change mentioned is a change in the keenness of our senses. This leads to the power to perceive more details of the universe, while as a matter of fact there is also a movement in the direction of whole-wise organic concepts. The having of such concepts is the same kind of experience as the having of other concepts. Secondly Mr. Heard says that we lose our desire for power over nature and are more impersonally interested. " Our true action is to watch and try to understand the drift, the flood, of the Universe," and on the same page (270), " Understanding reveals itself not as the means but as the end of life ". Is this really the case ? Even if it were, the fact that we manipulate finer grades of matter cannot con- ceivably make our activities less material. He believes that we can infer from the increasingly small trace we leave behind us, when we compare our relics with the pyramids and Palmyra, that " We are dematerialising ". Surely this must be meant as a pictorial re- presentation and is not to be taken seriously, and yet it is followed by an appeal to the uselessness of astronomy, the impersonal nature of the astronomer's objective, the detachment of his attitude, and finally on page 277 we read that this is evidence of " the building up of the new social consciousness, the new group personality ". It is difficult to see how we can possibly draw such a conclusion, and indeed one would have expected the astronomer to be devoting himself to social service rather than to the satisfaction of his own curiosity. The only difference between the 'individualist' and the astronomer is one of interest and not of consciousness; and we find the argument even harder to follow when, after dealing with the hypothesis that we are diminishing in size, he says on page 279 that " the diminishment of bulk means that mind can now and must now be carried on as a group affair wherein the units can rely wholly for their survival on a common co-ordinated immediate interest of the whole " (my italics). A further indication of change is that the modern concepts of physics are symptomatic of so altered a way of regarding the uni- -verse that the older physicists are incapable of grasping them. Mr. Heard then goes on to state of the modern unifying concept of the world, as if this were peculiar, that " derived from sense data . . . it passes under our eyes to-day beyond physical vision ". But any hypothesis of the ultimate nature of the universe must be in the same position, even if we believe in tables and chairs which persist when we are not there to perceive them,-puckers in space-time are no odder.</page><page sequence="7">GERALD HEARD, The Ascent of Humanity. 217 There is yet another attempt to infer altered consciousness. Our view of the world is non-anthropomorphic, once it was' anthropo- morphic; we have therefore changed. But can we admit that " as we attain unindividualised vision we ourselves alter. Our minds become, though still retaining their keen consciousness, integrated parts of a larger consciousness " (p. 285) ? Lastly with cosmology morality has changed. We think and feel more socially. This is true and undoubtedly indicates an alteration, but in what ? Not in our experience, say, of pity, but in the objects which call it forth. Our actions are, whether we like it or not, un- reasonably, and therefore 'naturally,' determined by the welfare of others and not exclusively by the welfare of ourselves. The position seems to be this. There is undoubted change in the springs of action, and change which seems to come from within rather than impressed from without-attitudes, interests, concepts alter. If we are right in supposing that the hypothetical co-conscious- ness of primitive man refers to a mode of being conscious, and not only to what he was conscious of, then there is evidence that our consciousness differs from his, but no evidence that we are attaining to a consciousness varying from our own in a way analogous to the way in which ours varies from his. We may go on experiencing very much as we do now, but inter'ested less in ourselves. This can hardly be called ' losing our individuality ' because it might be a distinct 'I ' who was interested in other people. ,Of course Mr. Heard might very well say that my arguments are due to my preoccupation with my own individuality and my dislike of the idea of losing it, btut this form of argument can be used in the opposite direction. In the last chapter Mr. Heard has some interesting and original remarks to make about psychic research. He finds its origin in witch-cults, which he interprets as; the emergence of proto-individual women, late developers. His suggestion is that there is an imper- sonal field of experience which can be tapped by people suitably sensitive. He calls attention to the fact that the sensitive have been found of later years among the ' higher individual class'. The general conscious field is very like that assumed by Jung to account for the persistence and spread of common legends and symbols, and Mr. Heard has here a convenient explanation of telepathy and haunt- ing. Interpretation of elements picked up from this common field varies with the state of evolution of the interpreter; first it is an- thropomorphic, then animistic and then increasingly impersonal. Surely this cannot be taken as evidence of our depersonalisation; if the personalised expression is due to some pre-occupation with per- sonality because of emergence from a totally different state of con- sciousness, when that pre-occupation is over, because of stability or other interests, it does not mean that we have altered our state of consciousness. Mr. Heard's visual scheme of ideation and pictorial vivid style are often, as I have suggested before, responsible for metaphorical 15</page><page sequence="8">218 CRITICAL NOTICES: expressions which sometimes make his arguments difficult to follow in detail. This is most evident in the first and last two chapters. It should be pointed out, however, that whatever may be said in criti- cism of Mr. Heard's views on consciousness and progress, in a great constructive achievement like this one cannot expect accuracy of expression on such technical points, and that the main thesis of the work, the development of individuality, remains untouched by argu- ments directed against the more philosophical parts of it. In any case he has made a very important contribution to social psychology, perhaps the most important that has yet been made in this language; and it is to be hoped that he will provide us with further studies of subjects which he has been forced only to touch upon in the book before us.
