ORLINSKY Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion, New York Chapter III On the Matter of Anthropomorphisms, Anthropopathisms, and Euphemisms IARGELY, if not primarily, because the LXX of Job is about one -י sixth shorter than the masoretic text and scholars generally almost automatically "blamed" the translator for this disparity,1 the translator came to be accused also of theological bias and anti anthropomorphism when some aspect of "normative" religious belief or of God — a "hand" or His "rage" or His alleged brutality, etc. — was not carried over literally from the Hebrew into the Greek. Per mitting the Greek renderings to speak for themselves, especially in the light of the knowledge gained in the preceding chapter, this chapter will will deal in five Sections with: A. Anthropomorphisms; B. Anthro popathisms; C. Alleged concept of an afterlife; D. Charges, and the like, involving God; E. Miscellaneous. A. anthropomorphisms The manner in which God and His actions are described in the text of the Bible was a familiar problem to the Jewish and Christian sages of old. H. A. Wolfson2 reminds us (pp. 127-8) that ". . . in Greek religion, the objections to anthropomorphisms on philosophic grounds led either to a rejection of the popular deities altogether or to a trans formation, by the allegorical method, of the popular deities in philo * Chapter I, "An Analytical Survey of Previous Studies," appeared in this Annual,Annual, 28 (1957), 53~74; and Chapter II, "The Character of the Septuagint Trans lation of the Book of Job," in 29 (1958), 229-271. 1 See Chap.

In native Judaism, the objection to anthropomorphisms on the ground 01 the scriptural doctrine 01 the unlikeness of God merely led to the general explanation that anthro pomorphic expressions are not to be taken literally, and that they are used in Scripture only as a practical pedagogical device to instruct the people in the knowledge of the ways of God in the world ..." Such rabbinic statements as □דברה תורה בלשון בני אד ("the Torah speaks in the language of human beings")3 and גדול כחן של נביאים שמדמים צורה ליוצרה ("great is the courage (power) of the prophets who compare creatures to their Creator," viz., by using the same language for both)4 were used freely by exegete and philosopher alike.5 This view is basically that of the Church Fathers later on, who had the benefit of earlier Rabbinic Judaism, Greek philosophy, and Philo. Thus Origen, Contra Celsurn (Book IV, Chaps. 71, 73), "But as, in what follows Celsus, not understanding that the language of Scripture regarding God is adapted to an anthropopathic point of view, ridicules those passages which speak of words of anger addressed to the ungodly . . . And as a sequel to his [viz., Celsus'] non-understanding of the statements regarding the 'wrath' of God . . ."6 Again, in his De PrincipiisPrincipiisPrincipiis (Book II, Chap. VIII, "On the Soul," § 5), "That as with respect to everything corporeal which is spoken of God, such as fingers, or hands, or arms, or eyes, or feet, or mouth, we say that these are not to be understood as human members, but that certain of his powers are indicated by these names of members of the body; so also ג Babylonian Talmud, Berakot 31b; and elsewhere. Xenophanes ("the first philosophic theologian"; 6th cent. B. c.) put it this way (cf. Wolfson, op. ext., 288 and n. 9), ". . . if oxen and horses . . . could paint . . . horses would paint the forms of the gods like horses, and oxen like oxen." 4 Genesis Rabba 27, 1; and elsewhere. 5 E. g., Moses Maimonides (1135-1204) in his Moreh Nebukim (cf. Wolfson, Philo,Philo, I, 135 and nn. 34, 36). On Targum Jonathan's attitude toward anthropo morphism and the like, see P. Churgin, Targum Jonathan to the Prophets (New Haven, 1927), Chap. IV, "General Peculiarities" (pp. hi ff., ". . . the targumist made it a principle to differentiate between the holy and the profane ..." — more so, it may be noted here, than in the case of anthropomorphism; on pp. 44 and 45, at three passages in Jeremiah [e. g., 16.11; 31.27], evidence is cited for the view that "later usage eliminated some anthropomorphic substitutes from the TJargum]"); and The Targum Targum to Hagiographa (in Hebrew; New York, 1945), e. g., 19 ff.

If this version, which had replaced the Hebrew original as their Bible, had practiced anti anthropomorphism, the problem would for all practical purposes have been resolved. But when God's "wrath" and "human members" were reproduced literally in the LXX, then Celsus had a point, and Origen had to reply to his philosophical polemic against Christianity.8 According to G. Gerleman,' ". . . The expression 'the hand of God' often has a purely symbolical significance, which does not convey any concrete associations whatsoever of an anthropomorphic nature. In such cases the translator, of course, has naturally retained the ex pression unchanged, e. g. in 12.10 . . . Likewise in 13.31 . . . Sometimes the translator himself actually introduces such a faded metaphor into the text without any equivalent in the original, e.g. in 2.10... Analogous with this is the translator's rendering of 'the face of God.' A passage such as 13.24 ... is evidently regarded by the translator as too concretely realistic, and he paraphrases it. . . On the other hand he is not at all shocked by the symbolically understood אס־לא על־פניך יברכך / et μην tis πρόσωπον σε ευλογήσει, 1.11, cf. 2.5 .. . The examples adduced," the author concludes, "may suffice to show the difference between the Hebrew poet's unreflectingly anthropomorphic view of God and the translator's scrupulous aversion to describing God in human terms." This sort of "reasoning" is described in some, non-academic, circles as: Heads I win, tails you lose. In other words, when the trans lator reproduces literally the "face" of God, it is only because it is only "symbolically understood," whereas \vhen he does not do so it is because it is "too concretely realistic." Had our author gone on to 7 The Writings of Origen, translated by F. Crombie (Edinburgh, 1895), p. 125. In In ed.

II, § 3 (pp. 132-6), "Origen agrees to a certain extent with Celsus in regard to the limitations of man's knowledge of God . . ." Our own problem may be seen from a broader view in William A.

ORLINSKY [4] cite such a passage as 14.20 he would have made it clear to his readers, and perhaps to himself also, that our translator was not bothered at all by anthropomorphism: masoretic (חחקפהו לנצח 1;הלך) משנה פניו (נינשלההו) was rendered ΐπίστησας10 αντω τό πρόσωπον (και 6ξαπέσταλαϊ) "Thou hast set Thy face ( = פניף; see Chap. V below) against him." Or cf. 42.5 (see under § פנים below). Again, what is one to say about such "reasoning" when the very concrete usage of "hand" of God in 2.5 (cf. 1.11), . . . (אולם) שלח־נא זיךף ונע (אל־עצמו ואל־בשרו) / (ού μην 8e άλλα) άποστβίλας την χίΐρά σου άψαι (των οστών αυτόν και των σορκώνσορκών αντου . . .), has to be dismissed by our author (p. 59) as a "less concrete context"! Or when 26.13 (חללה) ;דו (נחש בריח) is de scribed by Gerleman (p. 58) as an "Unduly anthropomorphic expres sion" because the LXX rendered it by 7τρσστάγματι (5e €θανάτωσ(ν δράκοντα δράκοντα άποστάτην)·, but what is less "unduly anthropomorphic" than God's "hand" in 10.8 (זיךיןי עצבוני 1;עשוני / at Xtlpes σου 'έπλασάν μβ και βποίησάν pe) — a passage not mentioned by our author — which our translator did reproduce without "dogmatic misgivings"? In the same vein: in its single occurrence in Job, the "lips" of God must have had "an unduly anthropomorphic ring," since the trans lator rendered it by ένταλμα "command," whereas the "mouth" of God must have been a "less concrete expression" because it was reproduced literally, στόμα "mouth." But on what basis is the "mouth" of God "less concrete" than His "lips"? How does one determine when the "hand" of God "does not convey any concrete associations" and when it does; or when God's "face" is "too con cretely realistic" on tlie one hand, and only "symbolically understood" on the other? Why are the "eyes" of God, paraphrased in 11.4 and 34.21, more "symbolically understood" or less "a faded metaphor" than the "face" or the "hand" of God? I suppose when one takes for granted and operates with, as though already demonstrated, a Q. E. D. Since we shall deal immediately with each anthropomorphism in detail, it will suffice here to state that, contrary to scientific method, our author began with the assumption that the LXX translator had a "scrupulous aversion to describing God in human terms" and when he was confronted by the plain facts of the Greek translation he proceeded to create, ad hoc, psychological, literary, and theological concepts and motivations for the translator — when he should simply 10 According to Schleusner, Novus Thesaurus Philologico-Criticus sive Lexicon in LXX,LXX, etc. (on this fine work, see Chap.

This fatal error in method holds true also for the section on "The Removal of References to Parts of the Human Body or their Func tions" (pp. 32-36) in the chapter (II) on "Anti-Anthropomorphisms" in D. H. Gard's work on Job.11 He, too, "explains" or ignores the numerous and obvious anthropomorphisms in the LXX of our Book so as to reach the conclusion — which happens to coincide with the original assumption — that "the translator reject(ed) any depiction of God in human form with reference to parts of the body . . ." (p. 36).12 But let us get on with the data themselves, directly. 1. 1.

In this instance it would appear that the LXX did not render ס.יד (cf. Beer, "&lt;8&gt; . . . 93 de manu מיד; ob Horfehler fur מאת?"; but Schleusner, V, 512, "Num [LXX] legerunt מיד?"), but employed a simple Hebra ism.

Fritsch (Princeton, 1943), where all but two of the num erous instances of the "hand" of God are admittedly rendered literally in the LXX, but where the two solitary instances to the contrary are "explained" as due to anti anthropomorphism; or where harah and qsp "be angry" are always reproduced literally in connection with God except once each, but where the many anthropo morphisms are brushed aside and the single instance to the contrary is made the evidence for anti-anthropomorphism.

On the other hand, it may be that 7τροσταχμα for יד in our context is due to the fact that the translator knew of a tradition that God had created the world and overcome the monsters not by direct physical action but by fiat; on the "Words" and "Acts" versions of creation and related cosmogonic struggles, see H.

And in 20.22, where (כל עד עמל (ו!1םאנו is represented by traça ôè àvàyicq [ = ע?ל?] (é7r' avrov tirtXtvtreTai), it may well be that יד is not original; note that many translations, even the more literal ones, have to paraphrase the Hebrew: et omnisomnis dolor (Vulg., following the LXX); "Tous les coups du 'malheur' " (Dhorme); "Every form of trouble" (Kissane, p. 150, "Every form lit.

The "arm" (זרוע) of God occurs but once in our Book, and it is reproduced literally, in a typically vigorous Jobian passage (40.9): ואכחרוע כאל | לך / ή βραχίων σοι έστιν κατά του κυρίου; 3.

In the fourth instance, 13.20, (אך־שתום אל־תעש עפרי) אז מפניך לא אסתר אסתר was not preserved in the LXX. According to Beer, "&lt;g hat 202 aus religiosem Bedenken weggelassen." In 13.24, לפה־פניך הפתיר (ותחשבני לאונב ?1ך) was translated δια τί άττ' εμου κρύπτη "Why dost Thou hide from me?" According to Beer (followed by Dhorme), "1 פניךst von (β aus dogm.

It is clear from ι.ιι // 2.5 and 14.20 that our translator had no qualms about reproducing literally the "face" of God any more than His "hand" or "arm"; note, e. g., the anthropomorphism and rather curt line that follows immediately on 13.20: בפך ם?לי הרסק — literally reproduced (τήν χείρα άττ' έμοΰ άπεχου). Furthermore, it is but a baseless assumption that he deleted an entire line (13.20b) because of God's "face": (1) No one has demonstrated that this line was present in the translator's Hebrew Vorla^e and that it was deliberately left out by him; (2) It so happens that the second half also of the verse pre ceding (19b), מי־הוא ,יריב עפרי) בי־עתה אחריש ואגןע), has not been pre served in the LXX; nothing anthropomorphic or otherwise allegedly "offensive" was involved here; (3) Our translator could easily have rendered מפניך prepositionally, by something like "before Thee" (note, e. g., εναντίον αΰτοΰ / אל / לפניו "before Him" only a few verses back [vv. 15 and 16]); (4) Indeed, our 20b finds its sequel only four verses farther on (13.24a) in 1מה-פניר תקזתיר? where, far from deleting the line, our translator rendered δια τί ά7τ' έμοΰ κρύτττχ!. So that whatever the reason (s) for the absence of vv. 19b and 20b in the preserved LXX, anthropomorphism was not one of them.</page><page sequence="8">160 HARRY Μ. ORLINSKY [8] As to 13.24a, it should be kept in mind that פנים "face; surface; presence; before (temporal and spatial); because of," etc., is the sort of term that lends itself readily to non-literal, idiomatic reproduction in another language. Thus, in instances where God was not involved, וךבצ?1 ואין מחריד) וזחלו פניף ךבים) in 11.19 — Zophar to Job — was rendered idiomatically (ησυχάσεις yap, /cat ουκ εσται ό πολέμων πολέμων σε,) μεταβαλόμενοι δε πολλοί σου δεηθήσονται. Again, in 32.21 אל־נא אשא פני־איש was turned into άνθρωπου yap ού μη αίσχυνθώ "for I shall not stand in awe of (lit., feel shame before) man."1' Yet in the very next verse (22) he resorted to idiomatic (oh yap επίσταμαι)επίσταμαι) θαυμάσαιθαυμάσαι πρόσωπον for 20■(כי לא ;דעתי) אכנה It is clear, then, that it is style, context, and the like — in short, "The Character of the Septu agint Translation of the Book of Job" (Chap. II)—not anthropo morphism, that determined for our translator the literal or non-literal reproduction of פנים, whether for God or for man. And if a clinching argument should still be desired for this view, it may be found in 42.5, where Job says to God: לשסע אזן שמותיך) ועתה עיני ראתף), and where our translator did not flinch in rendering it (άκοην μεν ώτός ηκουόν σου τότό πρότερου,) νυνί ό όφθαλμόϊ μοι εόρακέν σε, "but now my eye has seen Thee" — in gross contradiction, e. g., to Ex. 33.20, ויאמר [יהוה] לא תוכל לךאת את־פןי כי לא־ןךאני האךם ןיחי (reproduced there literally in the LXX).21 There is, finally, 33.26, where (;עתר אל־אלודז !;רצהו) גיר א ®;יו כתרועה ן:שב לאנוש צד,קתו)) is represented in the LXX by (ευχόμενος δε προς κύριον,κύριον, και δεκτά αύτφ εσται,) είσελεύσεται δε προσώπφ καθαρω συν συν tfryopiq. (αποδώσει δε άνθρώποις δικαιοσύνην). While it is not impossible that είσελεύσεται, derives from a reading ויבא (so, e. g., Beer) in place of masoretic וירא — and leaving פניו unaccounted for — I believe that our translator — correctly — understood ראה פניו (lit., "see His face") in the sense of "appear before Him for worship" (so commentators generally); cf., e. g., Schleusner, s. καθαρός (III, 138; see also s. εισέρχομαι / ראה, II, 262), "εν προσώπω καθαρω, " Schleusner would regard aiax^vopai here as being =revereor, respicio; see his discussion, s. v.

He equated פני איש with avdpuiros (I, 280 bottom), when — as it seems to me — he should have equated נשא פנים with aioxwopa.!.. The Old Latin rendered our 32.21 by neque enim erubescam faciem viri. 20 On the expression davpiàÇuv irpoouirov / נשא פנים, see my chapter "On the Textual Criticism of the Old Testament" in the W. F. Albright volume. 21 An acute study of "see the face of God" in the LXX of Psalms may be found in Arthur Soffer, "The Treatment of Anthropomorphisms and Anthropopathisms in the Septuagint of Psalms," HUCA, 28 (1957), 86-92.</page><page sequence="9">[9] STUDIES IN THE SEPTUAGINT OF JOB 161 h. e. ίλαρω: ubi καθαρω est merum additamentum, quod ideo neces sarium erat, quia antecedens ךאה de templum adeuntibus et sacrificia offerentibus explicaverat. καθαροί ibi respondet latino serenus, q. d. purus ab omni tristitia ac metu."

Gard (p. 78) suppresses all mention of the anthropomorphisms in 1.11, 2.5, and 14.20 (he discusses 14.17-203 on the same page, but did not include 20b), and is content to note — following Beer, Dhorme, etc., but without mentioning them — that "# . . . removes the anthropo morphic expression [in 13.20b] by leaving out line 2 entirely." He might, at the very least, have raised the question as to why it was necessary to leave out an entire line when it could have been rendered "innocuously" as but four verses farther on (13.24); or by resorting to prepositional εναντίον, or the like, for 23מפניו; or why כפך in the very next verse (13.21) was literally rendered. (On Gard's treatment of 13.20a, see my Chap. II, § 2, ad loc.) As to 33.26b, Gard believes (P· 57) that the translator "omits the ending ו of פניו 'his (God's) face' to avoid the idea that any man may see the face of God. &lt;3, therefore, by a trick of the translator, interprets ירא as יבוא and renders είσε\εύσεται . . ." On this alleged "trick," frequently at tributed to our translator, which I have characterized as but "playful 22 According to some scholars (e. g., Dhorme, following Beer "P "ונרא), "Syr. considère ירא come un nifal 'et il apparaîtra devant lui.' " This is hardly so (note that the Hebrew would have had to read לפניי), and certainly unnecessarily so; the Syriac, ונתחזא קדמוה', simply interpreted masoretic I'JS 11ךא, just as the LXX and others did, as "appear before Him." 23 I have not bothered in this study with the prepositional instances of לפני ; cf. my comments on prepositional בעיני and '3לפ in Crozer Quarterly, 21 (1944), 158. An excellent study of these, for the book of Psalms, may be found in Soffer, op. cit., pp. 92 f., 95.</page><page sequence="10">162 HARRY Μ. ORLINSKY [10] nonsense," see my Chap. I, 70 f. and n. 63; JBL, 73 (1954), 252 f. and n. 1. 5. The "mouth" (פה) of the Lord occurs twice in our Book. In 22.22 (קח־;א) מפיו (ר1וךה_) was reproduced literally: (6κλαβ6 56) e/c στόματος αΰτοΰαΰτοΰ (i£r\yopiav). In 25.12, however, our translator turned (מצות שפתיו ולא אסיע מחפןי צפותי) אמר'־פיואמר'־פיו into (άπό ένταλμάτων αύτοΰ και ού μη μη παρέλθω, 6ν 86 κόλπφ μου [= מחקי; see Chap. VJ 'έκρυψα) ρήματα αΰτοΰ.αΰτοΰ. Bickell (p. 42), Beer, Dhorme, and of course Gard (p. 35; but he suppresses mention of פה / στόμα in 22.22),24 blame this on the translator's anti-anthropomorphism. But not only was פה some times rendered — correctly — by πρόσταγμα (see, e. g., 39.27, where Job, not God, was involved; see end of § 1 above, on יד) or ρήμα,25 "command; word," but in our passage "the words of His mouth" means nothing more than "His words," just as the parallel in a, "the commandments of His lips" is equivalent to "His commandments"26; or cf. 29.11 (10) where (כי אזן שמ?ה (נואשתי (God is not involved here) was rendered idiomatically ο 1 86 ακοΰσαντ6ς (έμακάρισάν μ6) — contrast Theodotion ότι ους ήκουσ6ν (καί έμακάρισέν μ6). In fine, unlike פה / στόμα in 22.22, our translator rendered פה in 23.21 as he did only because of stylistic reasons. 6. Biblical לבב / לב is sometimes an elusive term: "inner man, mind, will, heart" is how Brown-Driver-Briggs {Hebrew Lexicon, 523a, 524a) defines it; for what is the "mind" (διάνοια; νους) to the Greeks and Western civilization generally was the "heart" (לב) to the Israelite and his fellow Semites.27 Thus in 7.17 (Job to God), (מה־אנוש כי תגדלנו וכי־תשית אליו) לבך was rendered (. . . ή οτι προσ6χ6ι,ς) τον νουν2* (6ίς 24 Gerleman (p. 59), strangely, overlooks פיו in 23.12b. He "explains" פיו in 22.22 as a "less concrete expression" than the "unduly anthropomorphic ring" of שפתיו in 23.12a. 28 Cf. Schleusner, 5. v. (IV, 552), for such passages as Num. 33.2 and Deut. 34.5 (על־פי יהוה)יהוה)יהוה), Deut. 1.26 and 9.23 (ותסרו את־פי יהוה אלהיכם), where everyone recognizes in פה the meaning "word; command." 26 LXX aT0 kvTaXixârœv avrov.

In 9.4 (Job about God) our translator reproduced דזכם לבב ואמיץ כלו)) by σόφος yap έστι διανοίρ. (κραταιός re και peyas). In 10.13'—Job to God — (ואלה צפנל!) בלבבך (,ידעוזי בי־ואת עטך) was trans lated (ταΟτα 'έχων) kv σεαι/τψ (οΐδα ότι πάντα δύνασαι).

At 10.13 Bickell (p. 43) and Beer ("&lt;β&gt; ... 1st dogmatische (Jber setzung") contend that the translator's kv σ6αυτω for בלבבך was due to his anti-anthropomorphism. Unfortunately for this view, one has but to call to mind 27.6, where Job's statement, (!(בבךזקו1י דזדןז&lt;קמ1י ולא אך?ל לא יחרף לעבי 9:9' was reproduced by ού yap σύνοιδα έμαυτω άτοπα πρόζας.πρόζας.πρόζας. Two additional passages in the Bible, where the wicked and Haman, not God, are involved, may be cited here as analo gous to our 10.13 and 27.6: Ps. 36 (35).2, (גאם־פמע לר?&gt;ע ביקךב לבי) / (φησιν(φησιν ό παράνομος του άμαρτάνβιν) kv έαυτφ [=ינ[לבו; Esther 6.6, ויאמר לוטן) בלבו) / (efaev δέ) kv έαυτω (Αμαν). While לבב / לב was ordinarily rendered in our Book by καρδία30 — where God was not involved — yet the following passages are instruc tive for our 7.17 and 9.4: 1.5 (Job about his sons), (אילי סבאו בני וברכו אלסים) בלבבם / έν τη διανοίφ αυτών; 1.8 // 2.3 (God to the diabolos), (ססבס לבך (על / אל־עבדי איוב / προσέσχβς rfj διανοίςι σου (κατά του παιδόςπαιδός μου Ιωβ (but προσίσχβς31 οΰν32 τω θβρόποντί μου Ιωβ in 2.3). 7. The "lips" (מבוזים) of God occur but once in our Book, at 23.12, where (דרכו לומךלוי ןלא־אט:) מצות מפלדו (ולא אטימ מחקי צפנסי אטרי־פיו) was rendered (. . . και ού μη ΐκκλίνω) από ένταλμάτων αύτοΰ (. . . ρή ματαματα αύτοΰ), "(... nor will I turn aside) from His precepts." According to Bickell (p. 42), Beer, Dhorme, Gerleman (p. 59), and Gard (p. 35), 2י On this passage in Psalms, as well as לב / KapoLa of God in the LXX of Psalms, see Sofifer, op. cit., 99 f. 30 On KapÔla, ètàvoia, and the like, see E.

Add, e. g., Josh. 14.8, the data compiled in M. L. Margolis, The Book of Joshua in Greek [Paris, 1931], Part III, ad loc.). It is a pity that Hatch did not analyze also vovs in the LXX. See also F. Baumgârtel - J.

ORLINSKY [12] &lt;81 suppressed the שפתים of God for anthropomorphic reasons. It is clear from our analysis above (§ 5) of the parallel אמרי פיו that our translator was not bothered by anthropomorphism in this connection: for stylistic reasons alone he turned literal "the precepts of His lips . . . the words of His mouth" into "His precepts . . . His words." This matter of style, likewise involving "lips" — but Job's, not God's — is evident also in 11.2,11.2,11.2, where (Zophar to Job) (חרב דברים לא ;ענה ואם־) איש שפתום (ו*ךק), traditionally "a man full of talk," was reproduced neatly by (. . . fj και) ό eDXaXos (oierat 611'at δίκα ως); see Schleusner, s. v. (II, 558). One may compare here Prov. 16.21, where (לחכנדלב ייקךא נבון) ומחק שפתים (''סיף לקח) was rendered οί 56 γλυκ6Γϊ 61' λόγω. 8. The "eye(s)" (עין) of the Lord illustrates very well the style of our translator. In 14.3 (אף־על־זה) ?קדות עינך (ואחי חכיא במשפט עעך) was translated (οΰχι καΐ τούτου) λόγο 1' έποιήσω (καί τούτον έποίησαςέποίησας 6ισ6Χ06ΐι' έν κρίματί ένώπιόν σον;), "Hast Thou not taken account (even of him)?"; and in 34.21 בי־עיניו על־דךכי־איש ןבל־עעךיו ;דאה was rendered αυτός yap όράτης έστίν epycov ανθρώπων, \έληθ6ν 56 αυτόν αυτόν ουδέν ων πράσσουσιν, "For He is a beholder of the deeds of men, and nothing of what they do has escaped Him." In both these passages, Bickell (pp. 42, 43) and Dhorme (Beer only in 14.3) would see cases of anthropomorphism. Bickell, with his one-track mind (see our Chap. I, pp. 58-60), saw this factor operating also in 11.4 (ובר 61 . . .) / ?זיתי בעיניך/u . . .) καί άμεμπτος έναντίον αυτού [=בעיןיו], "and [I am] blameless before Him") and 25.5 (וכוכבים לא־1כו בעיניו / αστρααστρα δέ ού καθαρά έναντίον αυτού, "and the stars are not pure before Him"), to which he might have added 15.15 (ושמים לא־זכו בעי;יו / ουρανός ουρανός δέ ού καθαρός έναντίον αυτού).33 First of all, so far as such passages as 11.4, 15.15, and 25.5 are concerned, it is a pity indeed that the "anti-anthropomorphists" failed not only to recognize or keep in mind the common prepositional function of בעיני (as of לפני; cf. note 21 above) but also to associ ate these "God" passages with such "human" passages as 18.3 (Bildad to Job: מדוע נחשבנו כבהקה נטמעו] בעיניכם] / έναντίον σου;) and 19.15 (Job about his erstwhile friends: כרי הייתי] בעיניהם}] / έναντίον αύτών).34 33 Gerleman (p. 59): "The expression 'the eyes of God' is always paraphrased by the translator in one way or another. By way of example ...11,4... 34,12 . .

This is exactly the idiom used by him in 22.4, where (המוךאקך יכיחך (,יבוא ע?!ך בק&lt;ן!?ט — note the virtually identical expres sions in 14.3b and 22.4b — was rendered ή \byov σου ποωΰμβνος (Xiy^d at (και συν(1σ(λ(ύσ(ταί σοι. (is κρίσιν,). Ziegler (pp. 286-7) has drawn attention to the "Wiederaufnahme desselben Wortes oder derselben Wendung . . . Im Buche Job sind solche Wiederholungen sehr haufig . . ."— where style and not anthropomorphism is involved; our own 14.3 and 22.4 — not listed by Ziegler — constitute a typical case in point. The translator captured well the meaning of 14.3, cf., e. g., Rashi לדקדק בחטאיו, "to observe / examine closely his sins"; Buttenwieser (cf. pp. 66-7 of our Chap. II), "Thou keepest constant watch." Furthermore, as noted, e. g., by (Driver-)Gray, Peters, and Kissane, our verse is to be compared with 7.17; cf. 17b (?ה אנוע! קי ק1נךל3י) ובי ס?וית א?|יו לעך, the LXX of which, η ότι προσέχ(1ς τόν νουν (is(is αυτόν, finds a fitting sequence in the rendering of 14.3a, Xbyov (ποιήσω.(ποιήσω.(ποιήσω. Dhorme would compare with 9.32-33 (בי־לא־איש בטני אעננו ןבוא :דוךו בב&lt;ןופט . . .). In the case of 34.21 (בי עי{יו על־ / αύτός yap όράτης), even Bickell admitted (p. 43), "attractionis quoque elegantia notari potest." This willingness to sacrifice a literal reproduction of עין for the sake of elegant composition can be seen in another passage, where God was not involved, 28.21: והיבמה . . .) ונעלמה מעי3י בל־לוי) / (ή δ( σοφία . . .) \(ληθ(ν\(ληθ(ν πάντα άνθρωπον, "(and wisdom . . .) has escaped the notice of every man."

While there is some LXX and Old Latin evidence for αυτου ("His") instead of μου ("mine"),35 there can be little doubt that our trans lator had עיני in his Vorlage and that μου is the original reading, αυτου being but a later scribal concession to MT.36 § 15, p. 197; this holds true even in Isa. 36-39, cf. Marshall S. Hurwitz, "The Septu agint of Isaiah 36-39 in relation to that of 1-35, 40-66," HUCA, 28 (1957), 75-83, § I A, p. 76 (with reference to M. Johannessohn's study). 35 R. Homes-J.

(Gard, 34). If the anthropomorphism had bothered our translator, he did not need to pervert what was to him Holy Writ; he could readily have resorted to various kinds of paraphrase. As for the alleged "simple trick," see end of § 4 above.</page><page sequence="14">166 HARRY Μ. ORLINSKY [14] In 24.23 the LXX differs too much from MT to be taken up here: ותךלו לעמה וושען ועיניהן על־דךכיחם / μαλακισθείς μη έλπιζετω ύγιαϊ θήναι,θήναι, άλλα πεσεΐται νόσοι. On the LXX rendering of עיניו על דרך in 34-21, see above. 9. God's נעש is mentioned but once in our Book, in 23.13, and it is rendered there as elsewhere in our Book for man's (והוא באחי וסי :נפש ונעשו (אן$ה 1,יעש) O3?'#' / δε καΐ αύτός έκρινεν ούτως37 . . .) ό γάρ auros (ήθέλησεν καί έποίησεν), "for He Himself (willed and did)," understanding נפש correctly as but the equivalent of a personal pro noun, parallel to הוא in the first stich. With this may be compared Job's נפש in 30.25 ([עגמה נפשי [לאפיון / έστέναξα [ίδών άνδρα έν άνάγκαΐϊ], "I groaned [when I saw a man in distress]") and 32.2 ([ניכור אף אליהוא . . . כאיוב . . .] על־צזיקו נפשו [מאלהים]) / διότι άπέθηνεν έαυτόνέαυτόν δίκαιον [εναντίον κνρίου], "because he declared himself just"). It is, finally, interesting to note that regardless of the Greek conception of ψυχή, our translator felt no compunction in reproducing literally 13.14, ונפשי אשים בכפי / ψνχήν δε μου θήσω 'εν χειρί. 10. In two of the three times that mention was made of the נשמה of God, the LXX reproduced the term literally: 32.8, (אכן רוח־היא באנוש) ונשמת שדי (הכינם) / πνοή δε παντοκράτορος; 33-4- (,W? (רוח־אל ונשמת שדי (אסנני)) / ττνοη δε παντοκράτορος (η διδάσκουσα με [ = תחוני; see Chap. V below]).38 This is the same word that our translator employed for the נשמה of Job in 27.3: כי־כל־עוד נשמתי בי / η μην 'έτι τήςτής πνοής μου ένούσης. Consequently, because (מנשמת אלוה (יאבדו ומרוח אפו וכלו in 4-9 was reproduced by ά7τό προστάγματος κυρίου (άπολοΰνται, άπό δέ πνεύματος πνεύματος όρ~γής αύτου άφανισθήσονται), it is methodologically wrong to assume, as did Beer (cf. Bickell, p. 43), that "&lt;© . . . nur 37 I have elsewhere ("Jewish Scholarship and Christian Translations of the Hebrew Bible," Yearbook of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, 63 [1953], 238238 f.) drawn attention to Leo Prijs' convincing solution (Judische Tradition in der SeptuagintaSeptuaginta [Leiden, 1948], 32) of this long-standing Hebrew-Greek problem (see, e. g., the several — desperate — opinions collected in Beer), namely, LXX "if He Himself has judged thus" reflects an interpretation of והוא באחד that coincides — or shares a common origin — with the rabbinic interpretation preserved in Midrash Rabbah on Deut. 1.7, . . what does והוא באחד mean? Resh Lakish said, 'That the Holy One blessed be He renders and seals a decision by Himself' כך שנו רבותינו,) " אל תהי דן יחידי, שאין דן יחידי אלא אחד, שנא' [איוב כ"ג] והוא באחד ומי ישיבנו, ומהו והוא באחד, אמר ריש לקיש, שהקב"ה דן וחותם לעצמו. 38 If (ונ&lt;ן!מת מי (;צ$ה מטך in 26.4 refers to God (cf., e. g., [Driver-]Gray, Kissane). then irvori Si rivos terriv would be an additional case in point.</page><page sequence="15">[15] STUDIES IN THE SEPTUAGINT OF JOB 167 dogmatische Obersetzung, weil Gott bei dem alexandrinischen Juden keine נשמה haben darf" (pace 32.8 and 33.4 in our Book, and the LXX elsewhere in the Bible!); cf. Dhorme, "&lt;S . . . pour 6viter l'anthropo morphisme." Actually Schleusner explained the LXX a long time ago (s. v., IV, 498), "Non legerunt ממצות, ut nonnullis placuit, sed rem expresserunt non vocis proprietatem. Nam flatus iste Dei est eius imperium."imperium." Ziegler (p. 280) lists our נשמה / πρόσταγμα as one of a number of instances in which our translator "Konkreta durch Abstrakta wiedergegeben"; and cf. πρόσταγμα for God's יד in § 1 above. 11. The רוח of the Lord is referred to three times in our Book, and twice it is translated literally: 27.3, (י־?ל־עוד (?!?חי גי) ןרוס אלוה (?א?י?) / (η(η μην ετι της πνοής μου ενούσης) πνεύμα δε θεΐον (το περών μοι εν εν ρισίν); and 33-4רוח־אל (??!חני ונ^מת ?!די תח-'ני) ' / πνεύμα θείον (τό ποίησανποίησαν με, πνοη δέ παντοκράτορος . . .). In 26.13, however, (רוחו (?1מןם ?ו?ךה חללה זיד1 ןח0 ?ריס? was rendered κλείθρα κλείθρα (δε οΰρανου δεδοίκασιν αΰτδν . . .), "the bars (of heaven fear Him . . .)." In the light of 27.3 and 33.4 (where the parallel נשמה was likewise reproduced literally; see immediately above), it was but gratuitous on the part of Bickell to accuse our translator of rendering ברוחו by κλείθρα in order to avoid the anthropomorphism (p. 10, n. 13, "ברוחו, LXX κλεϊθρα = בריחי ad eliminandum afllatum Dei"). Clearly the LXX- Vorlage read בריחי (so most commentators, e. g., Schleusner, s.s. v., Ill, 324; [Driver-jGray; Dhorme); whether בריחי is — or harbors something of — the original reading, will be taken up later. Note that κλείθρα κλείθρα was used also in 38.10 for ריח?· (to be continued)</page></plain_text>
