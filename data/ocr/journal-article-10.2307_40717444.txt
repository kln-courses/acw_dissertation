<plain_text><page sequence="1">by Joel B. Diriam and Rudolf R. Rhomberg â–  the nation and the govern- ment have been of several minds about foreign aid, and all of these theoretical positions have taken on palpable form as governmental of- fices. The list is unusually lux- uriant, even for Washington, in alphabetical combinations and cryptic syllables: ECA, TCA, MSA, FOA, ICA, DLF, Exim- bank, IBRD and IMF. Included in this heterogeneity are the newly born, the mature, the declining, the dead and buried, and the dead and stirring. Congress made another of its recurrent efforts to achieve a defi- nition by altering C. Douglas Dillon's administrative personality last year. It removed the "Deputy" from his title of Deputy Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and fixed his annual salary at $500 more than that of the Di- rector of the International Coop- eration Administration. Congress assumed that it thus had answered the question of who was to be master of economic aid. But there is no indication that this anthropomorphic approach will unravel all the complications. We still have a major conflict be- tween the need for a nimble con- duct of day-to-day diplomatic af- fairs on the one hand, and for the sound administration of a long-run development program on the other. The ICA is the major single dispenser of nonmilitary economic aid. A semiautonomous unit of the State Department, it allocated a billion dollars, for the most part in grants, in fiscal 1958. Some of these funds went to defense sup- port, aid which strengthens the economies of allies and permits them to maintain more adequate military establishments. The De- fense Department, however, con- trols direct military assistance in weapons and material Other agen- cies handle other phases of eco- 7g Challenge</page><page sequence="2">nomic assistance, many in the form of loans. The primary purpose of the Export-Import Bank is to foster American exports, but it has found itself competing with other agen- cies in financing economic devel- opment. Its career illustrates the pragmatic responses occurring when the nation's policy needs changed faster than official poli- cies. Eximbank was created in 1934 to help finance exports to Soviet Russia, a simple purpose subsequently overshadowed by the more complicated goals of a more complicated time. Its bilateral aid commitments in fiscal 1958 totaled $733 million. While Eximbank remains auto- nomous, Congress created a new agency in 1957, the Development Loan Fund, designed to do frankly what Eximbank does illogically. Unlike the ICA, however, the DLF, which began with an initial appropriation of $300 million, is relieved of the disrupting require- ment of submitting annual re- quests for funds to continue its existence. And unlike Eximbank, which is held to strict business principles, the DLF can accept loan repayment in local currencies, a boon for the underdeveloped bor- rower with a weak currency. The United States also partici- pates importantly in such interna- tional organizations as the Inter- national Bank for Reconstruction and Development (see Challenge Profile, page 70), the International Monetary Fund and the UN Tech- nical Assistance program, all op- erating in the general area of in- ternational aid. This double role is extended to the narrower field of scientific aid, with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission com- peting with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The American chairman of the inter- national agency has complained, for example, that the AEC has virtually undermined its program of multinational aid by negotiat- ing AEC bilateral agreements. Yet the IAEA was formed on American initiative. A certain amount of personal coordination of these multifarious activities is achieved through Under Secretary Dillon. In his State Department dignity he re- views the military and economic assistance programs, and can keep himself informed on any other relevant matters like atomic en- ergy. He is also chairman of the Development Loan Fund Board, conducts liaison with Eximbank and is alternate U.S. governor of the IBRD, popularly known as the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. It is obvious that Dillon's administrative personality suffers dilution among the wide reaches of his responsibilities. The consequences of the lack of coordination are serious. Appli- February 1959 79</page><page sequence="3">cants have the inducement of playing off one source of funds against another. It is also difficult for the agencies to apply uniform long-run development criteria to applications for funds, if indeed they are disposed to use such cri- teria. Nothing in their statutes requires the agencies themselves to subordinate their policies to a consistent set of specific long- range objectives and, indeed, the practice of annual appropriations makes it impossible for so im- portant an agency as the ICA to look beyond the administrative present. Conflicting objectives pre- vent orderly sequence and area dis- tribution of loans and grants. "Voluntary" system Some American policies conflict with the economic improvement of underdeveloped areas. Reciprocal trade ageements are not univer- sally applicable, and thus cause in- equity of treatment for those who are excluded. The imposition of quotas on the import of lead, zinc and sugar sabotages the efforts of the ICA, Eximbank or DLF to aid Latin America. The Interior Department administers the "vol- untary" oil import quota system, justified on the transparently spe- cious ground of national defense, which sacrifices international in- terests for the sake of oil market stability at home. Other American policies have a chameleonlike character that sometimes supports and sometimes hampers our aid programs. Thus the disposal of surplus agricul- tural commodities presents a series of complex problems. These prod- ucts can be of enormous assistance to food-poor countries but they also reduce the markets for nations that depend on food exports for revenue. The theoretical complex- ity of the problem is reflected in the administrative complications, and those concerned with com- modity disposal include the De- partment of Agriculture, the Com- modity Credit Corporation, the State Department, ICA and Exim- bank. The situation has evoked con- siderable ingenuity in maximizing the benefits of the program, and if it was necessary to extend the bureaucratic interweavings, the results have sometimes justified the confusion. Thus Congress has passed laws permitting payment in local currencies for the surplus products, with the money being used for economic development projects or loans to local business- men. The ICA reviews all pro- posals for the development use of funds, while Eximbank passes on the loan applications. The lack of coordination among the American agencies is matched by a lack of clarity in their rela- tions with the international or- ganizations. It is impossible to 80 Challenge</page><page sequence="4">say just where the responsibility of the one group begins and that of the other group ends. The World Bank has tended to restrict itself to loans to build up the "basic economy"-ports, roads and electric power projects. Yet Ex- imbank has loaned Ecuador and many other countries millions for highway construction and other infrastructural projects. Another obstacle to efficient development assistance is the fail- ure to coordinate private invest- ment with public grants and loans. Public assistance to areas or in- dustries that can count on private funds should be minimized. Un- less there is a hostile political situation, private capital will launch itself into petroleum ex- ploration or refining. Countries like the Arabian sheikdoms which enjoy mineral royalties should need less help, while the extensive investment and enlightened man- agement of the United Fruit Com- pany in Guatemala and Panama relieves the public sector of much of the aid burden. We could raise the productivity of our global aid program if we were to compile and analyze carefully the invest- ment plans of private firms. Variety vs. logic The history of our aid programs in general, like that of Eximbank in its smaller compass, has been characterized more by variety than logic. The Economic Cooperation Administration, created in 1948 to administer the Marshall Plan, was remarkably effective in its rela- tively simple objective of reviving a developed and homogeneous area. More specific Communist pressure, taking such ugly forms as the Korean episode, imposed new responsibilities that included frank military assistance. The EC A was transformed into the Mutual Security Agency to carry on the greater task. Meanwhile, the Technical Cooperation Admin- istration, created within the State Department in 1949, was charged with technical and economic aid in Latin America, the Middle East, Burma and Indonesia. The MSA Director was responsible for co- ordinating the TCA program and the military assistance operations of the Defense Department. Congress attempted to improve the tenuous coordination by chang- ing the MSA into the Foreign Op- erations Administration in 1953. The new agency took over the technical assistance program of the State Department and had su- pervisory authority over Defense's military assistance, but this cen- tralization proved temporary. In 1955 the Defense Department got back its powers over military aid, and the independent FOA became the International Cooperation Ad- ministration as a subordinate agency of the State Department. February 1959 81</page><page sequence="5">Yet the ICA Director, owing per- haps to his former autonomy, has remained a powerful figure, and Dillon's salary increase, which the former banker did not need as a work incentive, was meant to counter the residual force of the ICA. Thus the centralization of economic policy, failing in the case of the FOA, was transferred to the office of the State Depart- ment's Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. Untidy political events have re- flected unkindly on the effective- ness of our foreign economy poli- cy. Nasser's seizure of Suez showed that decisions about eco- nomic development, like the with- drawal of the Aswan Dam loan, can have shocking consequences. Other developments, the intensi- fied Sino-Soviet program of as- sistance to underdeveloped areas, the hostility aroused by U.S. quotas on lead and zinc imports, and Vice President Nixon's recep- tion in Peru and Venezuela, should have enforced the lesson. Long-term affair What possible solutions may be suggested for this multidimen- sional complexity? It would be naive to assume that a mere re- shuffling of the agencies could suddenly eliminate disorder. Nev- ertheless, there are changes which could result in substantial im- provements. First, it seems clear that military aid should be finally and definitely separated from eco- nomic aid both in the budget and in administration. But it is necessary to go fur- ther. The economic aid program can be carried on effectively only if there is general recognition that it is a long-term affair and that it will be continued on a large scale. We must somehow concen- trate U.S. policy and operations in one organization, which will then be able to conduct liaison with the multinational agencies and allocate funds accordingly. It would be similar to the Foreign Operations Administration, which Congress has rejected less than four years ago. But it was the Congressional misreading of the future that led to FOA's demise, and long-term development assist- ance will replace the old-style foreign aid which served only short-run purposes. The American contribution will increasingly be looked upon as a continuing in- vestment project rather than as a temporary hand-out. Another deficiency of FOA was the failure to define its role vis-Ã - vis the State Department, the De- partment of Defense and other agencies. If Congress created a Foreign Economic Administration at the departmental level it could avoid the paradox of FOA, which was subordinate in policy matters to the State Department and yet 82 Challenge</page><page sequence="6">had authority to supervise De- fense Department military assist- ance programs. The proposed agen- cy would have full authority for formulating and carrying out our long-run foreign economic policy, but would have nothing to do with military assistance. It would ab- sorb Eximbank, DLF and ICA, and it would direct the surplus com- modity disposal program. Organ- ized on a regional basis, it could insure the fullest possible integra- tion with programs of multina- tional agencies and regional groups. Economic choice The agency would be able to select from a wide range the kind of assistance most desirable for applicants. It would have funds ranging from hard loans in dol- lars through local currency loans to outright grants. Interest terms and maturities would likewise be flexible. Such an agency would be able to make an economic choice among countries and projects in order to maximize the benefits from a given total of funds ap- propriated by Congress, with the full knowledge of what private investment and multinational agencies were currently propos- ing and accomplishing. Applicants, knowing that there was only one source of funds, would be stimulated to prepare sound development programs. Since this new organization would be relieved of pressure to adjust its policies to short-run diplomatic considerations, it could avoid the embarrassments we have suffered when temporary considerations determined the disposition of ap- plications like the Polish loan. In retrospect, we have gained little by allowing our long-run policy to be so distorted. It is true that the main diffi- culties with our foreign assistance program-multiplicity of objectives and lack of unified administration -reflect the democratic process. However, it would be in our best interest to show the rest of the non-Communist world how these difficulties can be overcome in a democracy. We do not have to prove that democracy grants more freedom than other forms of gov- ernment. What we may have to prove is that democracy does not necessarily mean less efficiency in the problem of peace and survival. â–  Space and Alaska scientists report that Alaska may be the best possible site in the Continental United States for launching space ships with human pas- sengers.
