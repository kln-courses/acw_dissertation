IT can seldom have fallen to the lot of any reviewer to examine a book closer packed with learning, laboriously and honestly gathered, than this sumptuous pair of tomes. Mr. Cook has ransacked every corner of classical literature and art, from the most famous to the most obscure, to get materials for his study, whereof this is but the second of at least three volumes. The results of his search he has poured out in a wealth of illustra- tions and in a huge number of footnotes and appendices, the former varying in length from two or three words to several close-printed pages. His industry is prodigious, and the student who consults his work may rest assured that, so far as material goes, little has been omitted, although there are a few gaps, some caused by the inability of any one man to read or see everything in so wide a field, some owing to the very long time needed to get the book through the press, which forced the author either to omit or to content himself with briefly noticing in the second part several works which appeared in the mean- while. But, for a reviewer, the serious question is :-What use has Mr. Cook made of his learning? Is the book to rank with Frazer's Totemism and Exogamy, to which one turns alike for abundant material and for penetrating and suggestive inter- pretation, or with Donelly's Atlantis or Bachofen's Mutterrecht, 305</page><page sequence="2">306 Reviews. in which one may delve for useful facts while smiling at the absurdity of the theories which knit them together? There is no room, in a notice of moderate length, to go into small detail; I shall pass in review some of the chief features of the work, with a view to judging their value to the serious student either of Greek cult in particular or of the worship of sky-gods in general. To begin with, as a piece of book-making the work is un- wieldy and ill-proportioned. The subject is the cult and myth of a great god, and incidentally of several other deities more or less connected with him; no attempt is made, or could be made without writing a whole library, to give an account of all the monuments of that cult in art or architecture. Why then is so much space taken up with illustrations and descriptions, such as would be very desirable in a treatise on ancient art, of such monuments ? Take for example Plate X. It is a good and clear reproduction on a large scale of an interesting votive relief, erected by one Xenokrateia to a number of deities, great and small, in gratitude for the gift of a son. But its con- nection with the argument of the section in which it occurs is simply this, that one of the gods is the Pythian Apollo, who is seen with his feet resting upon the sacred omphalos, and Mr. Cook is here discussing the nature and significance of that symbol. A small figure in the text and three or four lines of reference and description would have sufficed. The whole business of the cult of Apollo is in the nature of a digression; we have therefore a digression within a digression, one of many, and the result is that the book is most difficult to read with understanding, even with the help of the retrospect provided (pp. 840-858). But far more important than such formal weaknesses, which a blue pencil might easily have cured, are the faults in argument. It is one of the most important doctrines urged in the book that the sky-god, whether Zeus or another, is throughout a great part of Europe associated with a path of souls in heaven, the Milky Way, and with pillars or pillar-like structures erected to keep the sky from falling. As regards the former, the author produces (pp. 36 et seq.) on the one hand several passages proving</page><page sequence="3">Reviews. 307 that savages and barbarians in sundry parts of the world regard the Milky Way as a path of souls; on the other, citations from Greek authors proving that they held a similar view. But, and here the proof breaks down, the classical passages are one and all from philosophic writers influenced by astronomical doctrines, which, as is well known, had a great tendency to transfer the traditional underground House of Hades to some place quite outside the earth and among the stars. What Mr. Cook does not produce (because it does not exist) is any passage indicating that Simple folk in Greece had any such doctrine as part of their ancestral beliefs. As regards the pillars, he gives descriptions and illustrations of them in abundance. But when it comes to producing proof that anybody seriously feared that the sky would tumble on him, and especially that primitive Europeans feared anything of the kind, his arguments amount to this (pp. 54-5): there are certain stories to the effect that barbarians, Kelts or Bastarnians, either said they feared nothing else, or thought during a violent thunderstorm that the heavens were falling on them; there is a Latin proverb " What if the sky should fall? " meaning "That's an absurd suggestion," and one instance of a Greek oath, " If this is not so, may the sky fall on me," (Mr. Cook has stated elsewhere that he finds con- firmation of his theory in certain Irish oath-formulae); and, lastly, there is the droll of Henny-Penny. - This satisfies Mr. Cook that " the lower classes in Italy and at least the Megarians in Greece shared with Celts and Bastarnians the paralysing fear that some day the sky itself might fall " (p. 55). His sky-pillars lead him to a discussion of the Delphic om- phalos, concerning which he assumes,-for he produces nothing that could be called proof,-that it was the support of a sky- pillar. He holds also that it was an omphalos (navel or navel- cord) in the literal sense, i.e. the place where the sacred navel- cord of the infant Zeus was buried, (this despite the fact that the word means simply " central point " as early as Homer, and that ancient tradition agrees that that is what it meant at Delphi). This leads to a quainter conclusion yet. The Pythia, or Delphic prophetess, sat on top of a tripod to await inspiration. Therefore, she was sitting on a sky-pillar, (a tripod sometimes</page><page sequence="4">308 Reviews. has a columnar support) ; and, as the language of sexual union is not infrequently used concerning the god's relation to her, she may be considered his bride. Therefore (p. 21o) she must have been through some rite of apotheosis, (one wonders why) ; therefore it is likely that she was boiled, for boiling in a magic cauldron is a known form of getting rid of mortality, in Greece and out of it, and a tripod is among other things a cauldron- stand. But, as she did not die every time she had to prophesy, the boiling must have been a mere pretence. It is enough to set down the outline of this argument; it needs no refutation. Furthermore, as he is on the subject of Delphi, he assures us in defiance of all chronology that Dionysos must have been there before Apollo; for Zeus was there (on his theory of the omphalos), so also was Themis, who is often identified with Earth, and so " their Thraco-Phrygian offspring " may well have been there too (p. 239). In support of this he cites the doubtful statement of several late writers, (he admits that the evidence goes back no further than the third century B.c.), that Dionysos was buried at Delphi. This proves simply that, in an age already full of Euhemeristic ideas, some ancient cult-monument there was identified as a tomb, and its occupant named as the dying and rising Zagreus, whom many identified with Dionysos, rightly or wrongly. All the accumulated evidence of normal Greek tradition that Apollo, while not the original occupier of the holy place, had been there for a long time when the stranger Dionysos made his way into Greece and was hospitably received by his half-brother, must yield to arguments of this sort, backed by a few scraps of very late writers such as lamblichos concern- ing the views held by Pythagoras on Delphi and its history. Sundry disquisitions concerning monuments on which Zeus appears to be doubled, and which Mr. Cook, who knows not the ars nesciendi, proceeds to interpret, bring us to lanus (pp. 326 et seq.). Here we have some very old friends, some with com- paratively new faces. Ianus once more appears as a sky-god, as Dianus, as Virbius,-which in turn leads to much erudition concerning the cult of Diana at Aricia,-in short, as nearly every conceivable thing, even the gateway which he plainly is. Thence, by way of twins, the divine twins Apollo and</page><page sequence="5">Reviews. 309 Artemis, and the Hyperboreans, with a liberal sprinkling of the views of Dr. Rendel Harris and no differentiation between Pythagorean speculations and normal Greek cult, we finally reach thunderstones, and so the Minoan double axe. In this Mr. Cook, like many other investigators, sees a thunder-weapon, and is of opinion that " the Minoans " paid divine honours to the double axe qua sign and symbol of an anthropomorphic sky-god (p. 548), a proposition which is hardly consistent with the facts that no certain representation of a god has yet been found in Crete, and that the double axe is never seen carried by a man, but always by a woman,1 thus suggesting that, whatever it really means, it is connected with a goddess. Then follows a very long account of double axes of all sorts, and in all manner of places, during which the ancient symbol is brought into very strange company, such as butterflies (p. 645) and crabs (p. 666). Such curious vagaries of the decorator are well worth cataloguing, although one may draw the line at following the author's too ingenious attempts to extract ritual and belief out of them. When, however, (p. 667) the local legend of Tenedos, which bears every sign of being a Hellenistic invention, is dragged in to prove that " the double axe of Tenedos belonged to a god conceived as the rebirth of his own father " the mytho- logist must needs rebel. It may be remarked in passing that Mr. Cook is particularly fond of mythical fathers who are identi- cal with their own sons, and does not seem to have lighted on the simple and obvious explanation that a mythical genealogy is often a comparatively late and reflective piece of work, with consequent doubt as to which generation a particular figure belongs. Later, the episode of the double axes in the Odyssey, combined with the name of Penelope, which perhaps means " ducky," sets him speculating on an underlying religious meaning, -sacred double axes and a goddess in bird form. There is no reason why this kind of thing should stop short at the Odyssey. In the first English novel that comes to hand, Charlotte Bronte's Villette, there occurs (chapter xxv) a mention of a girl called Polly, who is to go to school to Madame Beck. Considering 'Mr. Cook's figure 419 (p. 544), while interesting, is unconvincing in this connection. U</page><page sequence="6">31o Reviews. that Polly is a common name for a parrot, and that a beck is a brook, we surely have here a water-goddess in bird form. It does not seem to occur to our author that now and then, even in an ancient tale, an axe is just an axe, and that names derived from those of beasts and birds are fairly common among human beings of many races. Of the huge collection of material regarding double axes, as of the great thesauri of facts and speculations which make up the long lists of appendices, I have a further adverse criticism to make, despite their utility to the delver after material. That is, the lack of any real chronological sense in the arrange- ment of the data. I take one example. Mr. Cook wishes (pp. 1121 et seq.) to prove certain theories in connection with Zeus Meilichios, whom he connects with supposed divine kings of early date. He takes as a starting-point a story which can- not be traced further back than the beginning of the Christian era, and looks to it for evidence of very early (prehistoric) Attic belief. To this he adds (p. 1132) a casual statement in the great myth of Er, in Plato's Republic, that the soul of Agamem- non became an eagle, and again looks to it for evidence of an early popular idea,-forgetting apparently that the myth in all its details is the work of a great and imaginative philosopher. Now comes a very curious interpretation of part of the Parthenon frieze as representing the deification of the king-archon of Athens ; an interpretation in which I can see not a shadow of probability, or even possibility. The conclusion is that ancient Attic kings claimed to be Zeus incarnate, and had magical sceptres, topped by eagles, which contained the souls of their divine predecessors. The date of these kings would be, at the latest, not far from the beginning of the last millennium B.c.; the date of the earliest evidence adduced, poor though that is, is the middle of the fifth century before our era. There are such things as survivals, certainly; but a proof which is entirely made up of supposed survivals to which a highly dubious meaning has to be attached is too weak to deserve much attention. It is for readers of Folk-Lore to say in which of the two categories mentioned in the second paragraph of this review Zeus is to be placed. H. J. ROSE.</page></plain_text>
