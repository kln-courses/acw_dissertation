<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES THE INTERVENTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN MECHANICS By ALFRED J. LOTKA, M.A., D.Sc¡ Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, U.S. A . The physicist, as physicist, sees the world essentially as a determinate mechanism. As a human being, on the contrary, he cannot help feeling, at any rate as a primary, naïve, un- analysed intuition, that certain events are governed by caprice, by his will and that of others. A problem thus arises. What opportunity can there be, in a determinate world, for the exercise of such capricious agencies ? Certain tentative answers that have been suggested or implied must be mentioned only to be forthwith rejected. So, for example, to some an opportunity for capricious interference with the course of events has seemed to reside in the freedom of action left open by the two fundamental laws of thermo- dynamics. W. Ostwald 1 observes that " the organism utilises, in manifold ways, the freedom of choice among reaction velocities, through the influence of catalytic substances, to satisfy advantageously its energy requirements." H. Guille- minot * sees the influence of life upon physical systems in the suostitution of guidance by choice in place of fortuitous happenings, where Carnot's principle leaves the course of events indeterminate. This point of view evidently cannot bear scrutiny. The two laws of energetics, indeed, are not competent to predicate unequivocally the course of events ; but this is true whether living beings are present or not. Yet, in the absence of such beings (and therefore irrespective of their caprice) the course of events is determinate, as we commonly suppose, in obedience to other principles well known to the physicist, and more exacting than the broad but indecisive first and second laws. 1 Vorlesungen über Naturphilosophie , 1902, p. 328. 8 La Matière et la Vie, 191 9, p. 121 et passim ; Nouveaux Horizons de la Science , 1916, p. 415 et passim.

Others have seen the opportunity for the interference of consciousness with the course of physical events, in certain indeterminate situations that arise in mechanical systems. Among the orbits of such a system some are unstable, passing through singular points at which " influences whose physical magnitude is too small to be taken account of by a finite being, may produce results of the greatest importance. ... In the course of this our mortal life we more or less frequently find ourselves on a physical or moral watershed, where an imper- ceptible deviation is sufficient to determine into which of two valleys we shall descend." 1 This conception makes the intervention of conscious volition in mechanics an exceptional occurrence, reserved for special occasions, or at least for a special set of circumstances, and Clerk Maxwell's quotation, in this connection, of Shakespeare's famous lines regarding the " tide in the affairs of men " seems to lend colour to the suppo- sition that he did conceive of this interference as in some measure an exceptional occurrence. In point of fact, while heroic efforts of the will are unquestionably rare incidents, volitional activity of all shades, down to the almost imper- ceptible, is a constant ingredient of human consciousness. It is, of course, conceivable that an exceptional set of dynamical circumstances is constantly present in the living organism. But, other things equal, one would feel better satisfied with a point of view that should give place to consciousness in the scheme of nature without resorting to the supposition of dynamically exceptional conditions. Such a point of view is now to be developed. Consider the elementary equation of dynamics / = ma . . . . . . (i) This equation is evidently devoid of meaning, or at any rate has no useful meaning, unless we have some other means of measuring the force / than by observing the mass m and the acceleration a and forming the product ma. It may be, for example, that the force /, to which (i) refers, is the tension of a stretched spring, and that we can measure this tension by the increase / in the original length L of the spring, writing / = K¿ (2) 1 Life of Clerk Maxwell , by L. Campbell and W. Garnett, 1882, pp. 434-44 ; Henderson, L. J., The Order of Nature t 1917, pp. 222-3, 226&gt; 227. Compare also Boussinesq, V. J., Conciliation du déterminisme mécanique avec l'existence de la vie , 1878, reprinted 1922.</page><page sequence="3">CONSCIOUSNESS IN MECHANICS 409 where K is a characteristic constant of the spring. The equations (1) and (2) can then be united, with elimination of f, into the relation ma - Kj- (3) The process by which the relation (3) has been obtained reminds one of a method sometimes employed in throwing a bridge across a river : Two independent structures are reared, one on each bank, and these two structures are gradually extended, with the aid of suitable scaffolding or auxiliary stiffening members, until they meet at the centre of the water- course. They are then consolidated, and the auxiliary members, the falsework, having served their purpose, may be dismantled. So in forming the equation (3), in throwing the equality sign across from the member ma to the member Kj-, the symbol / has functioned merely as a temporary truss, as a falsework to be discarded as soon as the relation is established.1 In point of fact this is the only function that an abstract force ever serves in the relations of classical dynamics. It never appears explicitly in the equations of physics or engineer- ing practice, as applied to any concrete case. The force is always eliminated in the process of forming the practical working equations. It never appears explicitly in these equations. Indeed, it cannot do so, for we have no means whatever of directly measuring an abstract force f. We can measure it only in terms of those very quantities which we substitute in place of /, thus eliminating f, whenever we form a working equation. Does it follow that the abstract force / is of no practical significance whatsoever, that it is a mere figment, an artifice, possessing no counterpart in objective nature, and incom- petent, therefore, to exert any influence upon the course of events ? This is not a question to be hastily answered. Some may be disposed to assert, upon grounds known to themselves and not to be drawn into this discussion, that Newtonian abstract forces are indeed merely figments, perhaps not even useful figments. But this is not the question here raised. The question here is, Does the unreality of such forces, and, in consequence, their incompetence to affect the world's events, follow as a necessary inference from the fact that in the practical working equations these forces / never appear explicitly ? And the question may at once be made more general in scope. 1 Compare Whitehead, A. N., Principles of Natural Knowledge, 1919, p. I9t 2 7</page><page sequence="4">4ÎÔ SCIENCE PROGRESS If a certain quantity F is invariably eliminated in the forma- tion of the working equations of the law of operation of a real material system, so that F never occurs explicitly in these equations, does it follow that F cannot correspond to any objective entity having an influence upon the course of events in that system ? The answer, perhaps, is immediately plain on the grounds of general philosophical principles. But if not, an illustrative example may serve to resolve any doubts. A mathematical theory of wealth, covering at any rate certain aspects of economics, can be built up in terms of prices and sales alone, without pushing the analysis of fundamentals beyond this point ; that is to say, without examining the human motives that, presumably, find their numerical expres- sion (not to say measure) in prices. On such a basis as this, for example, Cournot founded his admirable Researches into the Mathematical Theory of Wealth. But it is also possible, if one is so disposed, to carry analysis farther, to inquire into the psychological phenomena that appear at least as contributing factors in the processes of price determination. One is thus led to a theory of value such as that developed by Jevons. In a theory of value of this type human desires occupy a central position, and in the analytical symbolism of the theory appear prominently certain quantities &lt;£, variously " termed, by different writers, " desirability," "utility," " ophelimity," etc. Now it is conceded by the exponents of theories of this type that these quantities &lt;f&gt; admit, at best, only of indirect measurement, through prices. And, in point of fact, in all concrete applications these quanti- ties &lt;f&gt; are eliminated from the working equations. It is taken as quantitatively symptomatic of equality of desire for two commodities, if I am willing to purchase either the one or the other, indifferently, at the same price, in maximo. Now, desires that do not lead to purchases and sales evidently never enter the arena of economic contest, and therefore, it would seem, can be of no interest in the study of practical, commercial economics.1 Pareto, who certainly cannot be regarded as adversely disposed toward economic theory of the type developed by Jevons, remarks • : " Les notions de valeur d'usage, d'utilité, d'ophélimité, d'indices d'ophélimité, etc., facilitent beaucoup l'exposé de la théorie de l'équilibre économique, mais elles ne sont pas nécessaires pour construire cette théorie." It may thus appear that the ophelimities &lt;f&gt; are wholly 1 Cournot, A., loc. cit., p. 46 : " We do not see for what reason theory need take account of any demand which does not result in a sale." * Manuel d'Economi e Politique, 1909, p. 160.</page><page sequence="5">CONSCIOUSNESS IN MECHANICS 4n gratuitous importations into the theory of economics, introduced into the discourse only to be forthwith eliminated as soon as concrete application is to be made. Are we therefore to conclude that desires are mere figments ? Or even, granting their existence (since this will hardly be denied), are we to contend that they are without influence upon economic events ? Surely not. And yet, to an onlooker unable to peer behind the scenes, unable to taste directly of these desires that we observe by introspection as operating in our own selves, the matter might not thus appear. For, however erratic human desires may be in detail, in the gross they have an appearance of uniformity, of law, of constancy - a fact recognised long ago by Adam Smith, who " considered a science of economics possible because of a few outstanding traits of man which guaranteed self-preservation, while also promoting the welfare of society at large." 1 The same con- stancy in the average performances of men was again noted, from perhaps a somewhat different angle, by Quetelet, and once again by Spencer, who was the first to recognise the full significance, in the evolution of the race, of that " adjustment of feelings to actions " which has made " pains . . . the correlatives of actions injurious to the organism," and "pleasures . . . the correlatives of actions conducive to its welfare." ' To our extra-mundane observer, innocent of human emotions, and observing only in the gross the physical facts of our comings and goings, our doings and the action of environ- ment upon us - to him a system of laws, of correlations, might well become apparent, by which the past, present, and future course of events could be computed according to formula. His fundamental ignorance of our motives would in no wise disturb him in his calculations - so long as he were dealing only with human actions in the gross, and so long as his observations were not carried to an over-nice degree of precision, such as might reveal an occasional perplexing departure from the norm. He would be dealing solely with correlations - underlying motives would not concern him ; he might affect disdainfully to ignore them as " metaphysical " speculations incapable of proof or disproof. Yet we, who are in the secret, would know beyond per- adventure that his picture of our world and its happenings was deficient in a most essential particular. The accord between his formulae and facts might be never so good - in eliminating the &lt;/&gt; s from his working equations he would have banished from his representation of nature what must appear to us, " who know," the very core and essence of our being. 1 Boucke, O. F., American Economic Review, 1922, p. 599. * Principles of Psychology, § 124.</page><page sequence="6">412 SCIENCE PROGRESS Our immediate interest in the example furnished by the operation of " desires " in economics resides, not in such analogy 1 as these may or may not present to physical forces, but in the demonstration which the example has supplied, that a quantity eliminated in the process of forming the funda- mental equations representing the law of operation of a system may nevertheless play a highly significant rôle in the history of that system. And another point also is well illustrated. To the extra-mundane beholder of the drama of human society, a system of correlation formulae might suffice to represent the laws of operation in that society so long as observation were comparatively gross ; yet these formulae might fail when scrutiny were pushed to such refinement as to reveal departures from the general average, which average alone was the object of the grosser observation. Or, without increased precision of observation, instances might occur, special cases present themselves, in which individual salient departures from the norm forced themselves upon the notice of even the gross observer. It might so be that the elimination of the &lt;j&gt; s were feasible only with regard to the average phenomena observed, but could not be carried out in a perfectly general way. In that case an approximate description of the laws of the system could indeed be given in terms not containing &lt;ļ&gt; s, but for an exact description the &lt;f&gt; s must enter explicitly. This reflection is suggestive, because it reminds us that we must be prepared for this eventuality : the established working formulae of dynamics, in which abstract forces do not enter explicitly, may be true only in the sense of statistical averages, and only in approximation, however close. It may be that in all cases they depart in some degree from the truth, and that in some special cases - perhaps where conscious organisms enter - they do so very materially, through the absence of certain quantities whose elimination is justifiable only with reservations, whereas they have been eliminated outright.1 It is thus seen how the equations of dynamics, from their very nature, open the door for possible " capricious " inter- ference with the course of the world's events, through such 1 That such analogy exists has been noted, from different points of view, by various authors. See, for example, Zöllner, Über die Natur der Kometen, 1872, pp. 201-3 ; 211-19 ; 325-7 ; 361-4 ; Petzolt, J., Maxima und Minima und Ökonomie (Göttingen Dissertation), p. 22 ; Edgworth, F. Y., Mathe - matical Psychics , 1881, pp. 88-91 ; Winiarski, Revue Philosophique , 1900, vol. xlix, p. 113. 8 This conception is reminiscent of the tychism of Charles Peirce. ( The Monist ., vol. ii, 1892, pp. 333-4, 533. See also Henderson, L. J., The Order of Natur $, 1917, p. 100.)</page><page sequence="7">CONSCIOUSNESS IN MECHANICS 413 agencies, for example, as that which we observe in ourselves and denote by the word " will." But given the formal possibility of such interference, a new direction may now be given to our inquiry if we ask what may be the function of such interference ; how, in the evolution of this world, conscious volition, such as ours, entered the scheme of nature, and how it gained for itself its present dominating position. Parallel with the problem of the origin and evolution of life runs this problem of the origin and evolu- tion of consciousness, of will in general, and of those particular types of will, those behaviour-patterns, which we observe in ourselves, and which are revealed to us, more objectively, in the collective actions of bodies of men viewed in the mass, through the spectacles of statistical analysis. Now, of the two problems - that of the origin and that of the evolution of such will-types - the latter is the less formidable, it seems. Since Herbert Spencer the scope of free will has been recognised as in any event circumscribed. We may, perhaps, do what we please, but we cannot please what we please, for certain types of will-patterns, should they come into being, are incapable of prolonged survival, and cannot therefore be found in a race, such as ours, that boasts of a long line of ancestors. More baffling is the inquiry as to the origin of consciousness in the organic world. If we contemplate any one single act of a conscious organism, any one single response to external stimulus, it will be found that this response, or something very like it, can usually, if not always, be duplicated by some mechanism of human construction. It should hardly be necessary to adduce instances. Perhaps the most telling examples are certain mechanical toys, such as a tin beetle which gravely walks across a table-top, seemingly courting destruc- tion (as a going concern, at least) by making straight for the precipice at the edge of its universe. But such emergency is duly provided for : when it reaches the danger-line, the creature promptly turns and continues its perambulations hugging the edge of the table with its antenna. Now the question arises, if such zweckmässig actions and responses can be produced by purely mechanical means, why has nature resorted to con- sciousness, and resorted to it in increasing measure, in the evolution of the most exquisitely adapted organisms ? An obvious answer - too obvious to be accepted without further examination - is that there is secured, by the intro- duction of consciousness, an economy of parts, a comparative simplicity of structure. This certainly is true, that if, instead of being satisfied with the mechanical duplication of some one feature of animal behaviour, we insisted on reproducing, by mechanical means, the entire behaviour-pattern of a dog, for</page><page sequence="8">414 SCIENCE PROGRESS example, or even of any animal much lower in the scale of evolution, we should find ourselves inextricably embarrassed in an altogether unmanageable maze of mechanical parts. But how is this technical difficulty overcome by the introduction of consciousness ? Are the ascertained facts regarding con- sciousness competent to throw any light whatsoever on this question ? Let us briefly consider the matter. I know consciousness, as a natural phenomenon, directly in myself. I know it also indirectly, in myself, in its outward manifestations as I observe them in my acting and being- acted-upon. In myself, also, I know the relation between the phenomenon of consciousness, as observed directly, and these outward manifestations. Observing similar acting and being- acted-upon in others, I infer and hypothecate for them also, indirectly, similar consciousness, similarly related to these outward manifestations. So long as my inference relates to organisms closely re- sembling me in their outward characteristics, this process of inference perfectly satisfies the mind, and is thoroughly justified pragmatically in its consequences, that is, in the results of actions based upon my hypothesis of consciousness in those others. The process becomes more and more dubious as it is applied to organisms lower and lower in the scale of animal life, organisms differing more and more profoundly from me in their outward characteristics. Most of us will hesitate not at all to postulate for a dog a species of consciousness having much in common with our own. We should be much more hesitant in the case of an amoeba. And an important point to note is that as we recede farther and farther from constitu- tions similar to our own, not only do we become more and more dubious as to the existence of consciousness, but it becomes increasingly difficult for us to assign any definite meaning to the term " consciousness " as applied to an organism or portion of matter so constituted. In our own selves consciousness is a phenomenon essentially changeful in intensity, complexion, and content. It changes with season, age, and circumstance. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that certain features of our consciousness, features which we are habituated to look upon as inseparable characteristics inherent in the nature of the phenomenon, may in truth be only incidental, and may be peculiar to our particular type, our particular species of consciousness. So, for example, the normal healthy individual must find it difficult or impossible to conceive of any con- sciousness save that which is spun into one continuous thread by one presiding Self or Ego. Yet we know from the study of " abnormal " individuals that continuity may be lacking, there may be no clearly appreciated Self, or there may be</page><page sequence="9">CONSCIOUSNESS IN MECHANICS 415 several Egos related to one body ; and if there is but a single Self, its expanse may vary within wide bounds, from the small, narrow Self of the immature or mentally and morally underdeveloped person, to the world-embracing Self that says to every object perceived : " Thou art part of me." Our mind should, therefore, be in fair measure prepared to contemplate the possible existence of consciousness departing more or less radically from that general type to which ours conforms. But there are limits to this elasticity of our ready conception of consciousness. We must be prepared for the eventuality that the varieties of the objective phenomenon of consciousness may exceed the elasticity of our powers of conceiving these varieties , that is, our power of presenting them to our imagination in terms of consciousness as known to us directly by introspection. Consciousness, such as we know it directly in ourselves, and such as it is known to us in the least doubtful examples outside ourselves, seems intimately connected, in some manner, with life. Serious interruptions of the normal life processes are commonly accompanied by corresponding irregularities and sometimes by definite interruptions of the stream of con- sciousness. This suggests that consciousness is a state of matter, or attends a state of matter, which requires to be con- tinually " excited " by certain life processes, somewhat as the magnetism of the soft-iron armature of a dynamo is maintained by the passage of an electric current through a neighbouring conductor.1 And since one of the most prominent character- istics of life is that it is constantly attended by chemical change (metabolism), the inference readily comes to mind that consciousness is, or attends, a state of matter in the process of chemical transformation.8 And, further, since the distinction between chemical and physical changes is presumably arbitrary, our inference must be broadened, so that we find ourselves contemplating consciousness as a phenomenon associated with, or attendant upon, matter in a state of strain, or, perhaps, matter in the process of yielding to a strain. 1 Compare Sir Oliver Lodge, Life and Matter , 1906, chapter viii, in particular p. 129. 8 This thought has probably occurred to many others as well as the writer. He has found it expressed in a book The Unity of Consciousness , by W. E. Ritter (vol. ii, p. 291) ; and also in an article by Dr. Charles Stein- metz in Harper's Magazine , vol. cxliv, 1922, p. 300. The fugitive condition through which matter must pass on its way from one molecular arrangement to another still remains an almost wholly unexplored field, and Schoenbein's comment upon it (//. /. prakt. Chemie, vol. lv, p. 152) holds almost with its original force ; except that Sir J. J. Thomson's positive-ray analysis, with its power to weigh bodies existing but for one ten-millionth of a second, has proved competent to register the mass of such decapitated moleçules as CHS,</page><page sequence="10">4i6 science progress We find ourselves now in this singular position : we have based our reflections expressly upon the fact that consciousness, as typically known to us, is characteristically associated with life. And, by a few short steps, covering but two or three lines of print, we have arrived at a point of view which con- templates consciousness as a phenomenon that may be common to all matter. This is not as strange or as disconcerting as it may at first sight appear. It is notorious that all attempts to define life, to distinguish categorically between living and non-living matter, are dismal failures. More and more, as man's know- ledge advances, lines of demarcation in his outlook upon nature, in his representation of her, are found to be of subjective origin, and devoid of correspondence with any parallel lines of demarcation in objective fact. It is true that our imagination is quite incompetent to form for us any conception, in terms of our habitual modes of consciousness, of such elementary forms of the phenomenon as may be associated with the course of events in so-called non-living matter. Certainly the element of continuity and of synthesis into a thread of " personal " experience must be lacking. But, as already remarked, these features may not be so fundamental traits of the phenomenon of consciousness as we ordinarily suppose. The finished pro- duct of highly developed consciousness, such as we know it in ourselves, must represent, not a typical example, but rather " the acme of accomplishment in the integration of the animal organism. ... As such it has spelt biological success to its possessor." 1 The problem of the origin of consciousness in living organisms now is seen in a new aspect. Its ultimate origin, of course, is one of the unsolvable riddles of the universe ; but that is not the question here before us. Our curiosity relates not to this ultimate origin, but to the origin of consciousness as one of the possessions of the animal organism. Where and how, in the progress of evolution, did the organism acquire this remarkable and pre-eminently useful quality ? If the reflections set forth above are to the point, then this riddle is answered : the organism did not acquire consciousness at any time ; con- sciousness in some rude form belonged to it from the beginning, as it belongs to all matter. What was evolved was not con- sciousness itself, but a certain particular type of consciousness, a type of consciousness integrated into or around a more or less clearly defined Ego that presides over the behaviour of 1 Sir C. S. Sherrington, " Some Aspects of Animal Mechanism," Presi- dential Address, British Association, 1922 ( Nature , September 9, 1922, p. 35o)- I have taken the liberty of applying to function the words originally applied to the corresponding structures.</page><page sequence="11">CONSCIOUSNESS IN MECHANICS 417 the organism, and imposes unity of behaviour. As to the origin, the mode of development of this particular type of consciousness, we are tolerably well supplied with at least strong circumstantial evidence. This type of consciousness is characteristic of organisms that seek their food actively. Plants, whose food seeps to them by a spontaneous process in which they remain essentially passive, are devoid of those structures which observation teaches us to associate with the integrated type of consciousness. Even we ourselves adopt essentially the vegetative habit in drawing that part of our supplies which surrounds us in homogeneous abundance, and which is replenished by the automatic process of gaseous diffusion as fast as we consume it in respiration. Undoubtedly the food quest has been the dominating factor in developing the psychophysical apparatus of those species of organisms whose food is scattered heterogeneously - piecemeal - over the earth and has to be earned before it can be consumed. It may be humiliating, but there can be little doubt that we owe our mentality to the necessity of providing food ; our mind, whatever may be its functions now, has been developed primarily as a means to fill our stomachs. We have thus found at least the suggestion of an answer to the question : How did living organisms enter into the possession of consciousness ? They possessed it, according to this view, from the beginning, in common with all matter, in certain circumstances. Our particular type of consciousness was developed by the exigencies of the food quest. But there still remains the question : Why was the highly integrated type of consciousness selected, in preference to ordinary mechanism, to produce certain effects which, singly at least, can be copied by what we are pleased to call purely mechanical means ? It has been suggested above that the utilisation of consciousness for this purpose in some way secured economy of mechanical parts. Conflicting forces, and forces working together toward a result, are, in man-made machines, made to bear on one another, to produce their resultant, through material, mechanical members. What if they could be brought to a compact, to strike their balance directly, before they apply themselves to a piece of matter ? Is this what is taking place in our psychophysical apparatus when we weigh alternative courses of action, and make a decision ? Is this the secret of our neural integrating system ? There is a certain plausibility about the conception. It would account, at least in part, for that simplicity of structure, that compactness of material apparatus, out of all proportion with the results achieved, which is so characteristic of the human brain. And it would accord with a deep-rooted article of</page><page sequence="12">418 SCIENCE PROGRESS faith, the rock on which stands our concept of causation : we have an intuitive conviction of being the cause of the events which we successfully will. It is undoubtedly from this conviction that we derive (by a species of anthropomorphism which may be justified) our concept of causation.1 Perfect correlation may be a symptom of causation, but it is not itself what we conceive as causation. This is perfectly clear from the fact that we may have (practi- cally) perfect correlation between two sets of circumstances, which, by common consent, are admitted to stand in no direct causal relation. Our subjective concepts of perfect correlation and of causation are therefore clearly distinct, whatever may be the corresponding objective situation. Those who would totally exclude the naïve concept of causation from their repertoire of scientific concepts forget, for the moment, that they observe causation in themselves every time they perform a voluntary act. Busying themselves constantly with the observation of systems that are accessible only to observation of correlations, they have become oblivious of the fact that there are other systems accessible to observation through an exceptional channel (owing to the special limitation of the nervous system within the confines of the body), and that in these systems, if nowhere else, they know causation by direct experience. Whether causation of this same kind occurs, as a natural phenomenon, also outside these systems thus exposed to our scrutiny by an exceptional method of observation, that is a question toward which the only scientifically sound attitude, in the present state of knowledge, is that of the open mind. 1 To object that " the Ego is mistaken in supposing himself in any way the cause of the actual result " (to use Clerk Maxwell's phrase) is beside the point. The conviction exists as a phenomenal fact, irrespective of the justification of the conviction. If we define causation as a certain phenomenon of which we are directly conscious in volitional action (this we are entirely at liberty to do), the question of self-deception cannot arise at all ; its place is then taken by the question whether causation of the kind described by our definition has any part in " inanimate " nature. The physicist does not ordin- arily concern himself with this question ; he is well satisfied, for the time being, to leave it aside, his interest being, to-day, solely in correlations. (Compare Boucke, O. F., loc , cit., pp. 603-4 ; Pearson, K., The Grammar of Science , 1900, pp. 122, 128 et passim ; Niles, H. E., Genetics , 1922, vol. vii, p. 259.) But whether this policy of deliberately ignoring a fundamental phenomenon of nature can be lastingly satisfactory must appear very doubtful ; certainly, we cannot affect surprise at the fact that, adopting this policy, we should find ourselves in difficulties when we come to consider physical systems comprising conscious, living matter - a consideration which the physicist has hitherto avoided with discretion, or perhaps one should say with timidity, but for the attack of which sooner or later courage must be summoned. Blinders may be a justifiable part of the harness for a nervous horse, but they should not properly form part of the equipment of the searcher after truth.</page><page sequence="13">CONSCIOUSNESS IN MECHANICS 419 The point of view that has here been developed conceives such causes as possibly at work in all physical events. What dis- tinguishes us from so-called unconscious, inanimate matter is not, according to this view, the presence in us, and the absence in it, of causation of this kind ; but the integration in us, the bending to one end, of influences which in it are more or less chaotic, dissipative, bearing no relation to a controlling unity.</page></plain_text>
