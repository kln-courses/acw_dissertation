<plain_text><page sequence="1">127 Edward Bacon, ed., The Great Archaeologists and their discoveries as originally reported in the pages of the Illustrated London News ; pp. 428. London: Seeker &amp; Warburg, 1976. ?12.50. The Illustrated London News began to publish in May 1842. A generation before, the Elgin Marbles had arrived, in the British Museum. A generation later Schliemann was to undertake "eight days and nights of incessant travelling . . . with the object of reading his paper before the ?Society of Antiquaries] on his discoveries at Mycenae" (p. 54) to an audience that included "Mr. W. E. Gladstone, M.P., ELord Houghton, Lord Acton], Lord Aberdeen, Sir George Gilbert Scott, the Hon. Spencer Walpole, Mr. Beresford-Hope, M.P., the Revd. Dr. Thompson (Master of Trinity College, Cambridge), Mr. Alfred Tennyson, iMr. W. R. S. Ralston], Professor Leone Levi, Sir Philip Egerton, Earl Stanhope, Professors Colvin and Mahaffy, and Mr. Jajnes Spedding" (pp. 5^-55, corrected from ILN, 3l/iii/l877). The new journal reported not only finds of antique marbles in the Levant and various antiquarian discoveries within Britain, but increasingly also the more exotic and impressive revelations of past civilizations throughout the world. Mr. Bacon reproduces items from the years 1845 to 1875 that touch on the ruined palaces of Central America, the sculptures of "Nimroud" and Nineveh, the temple of "Ongou" or "Ongcor" Wat, and "The Ophir of Scripture" (dubiously detected in Zimbabwe), as well as the antiquities of more familiar places like Pompeii and Jerusalem. From his count of 975 archaeological reports published in the ILN between 1842 and 1921 he prints extracts from 77f occupying 145 pages, including 16 pages of added colour plates and brief summaries of omitted material (he gives 250 pages and 36 more added colour plates to the 2,126 further reports between 1922 and the first half of 1970, his terminus). The summaries, and. the five pages of introduction, are lucid and helpful, and there is an index of persons and places. For the reader who wants to go rapidly over the high spots in the cultivated British public's experience of archaeology the book is well adapted. Perhaps a few indications on Further Reading would have been welcome. Giving only the high spots must of course introduce distortions. One notices the omission of North America and the virtual omission of China. Despite the title (somewhat supported with four pages of "Biographical Notes") there is no excessive concentration on personalities. But there inevitably is ruthless concentration on the most glamorous major assemblages of artifacts, revealing communities for which there is little serious non-archaeological record. If we take Greece, for example, Bacon has nothing on the decipherment of Linear B, though it "completely revised the history of Hellas" (introduction, p. 15). He mentions papyri in the summaries (e.g., p. 114), but includes no items, not even Aristotle's Constitution of Athens (iLN, 31/I/I891). Almost all the major classical sites are excluded in favour of the prehistoric (for instance, Athens, Brauron, Corinth, Delos, Delphi, Olympia, Samos, Thasos?Gortyn gets a page and a half). Thus heavy weight must be laid on the qualification in the claim that "this anthology, represents in some sense a news-history of archaeology since 1842" (p. 15). For these selections inevitably give a much less real picture of what archaeologists actually do than the total of the original reports. One can still see, however, something of what has made "ILN" the only listing of a popular journal in English that often figures in scholarly bibliographies. Most important, perhaps, is the commissioning or reprinting of articles by the actual discoverers, scholars like Sir Arthur Evans or Sir Flinders P?trie. As well the journal has regularly been the first to show the public actual pictures of discoveries. The issue of March 24, 1877, for instance, proudly records</page><page sequence="2">128 "the employment successively of two Special Artists on the spot" (that is Mycenae, p. 51) and the issue of April 21st reproduces a number of drawings, from which Bacon chooses a romantic sketch of tomb-robbers in fustanellas against a backdrop of the Corinthian Gulf (p. 60). Bacon's excerpts tend to concentrate on the actual archaeological descriptions, and those who interest themselves more in the outlook of the journal and its readers or in the progress of axchaeological speculation than in the great discoveries themselves will regret such omissions as this sentence from the report on the British Museum exhibition of Lycian Marbles: "the importance of these artistic recreations cannot be too highly estimated: they are the antagonists of drunkenness and sedition, they create healthy tastes in the minds of the poor; they have made an Illustrated London News which the sagacious Times acknowledges to be "a sign of the times," a necessary adjunct to the family firesides of Great Britain and her dependencies"! or the cuts in the generous extracts on Mycenae which conceal Gladstone's claim to be a professional Homeric scholar and his opinions on the relations between Isis and Hera, "between the animal worship of the Nile and the anthropomorphism of Greece". The editing does not meet strict academic canons. Spelling and punctuation axe sometimes silently modernized and abbreviations written out, sometimes not. Misprints occur, as do occasional small alterations (thus "to have been owing" becomes "to be due" on page 53? while "to be" ?the houses of the dead] becomes "to have been" on page 54). In short the book was not designed for the professional scrutiny of readers of this periodical. But it was well received when I gave it as a Christmas present last year. E?bent suos lectores libelli.
