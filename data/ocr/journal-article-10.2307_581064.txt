<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1964-65 The planned investigations of Greek excavators have again been fruitful, particularly those at the newly discovered Minoan palace at Zakro and else- where sponsored by the Archaeological Society of Athens. The work of the foreign schools has con- tinued on the normal scale, their successes dominated by another rich harvest of bronzes from Olympia. But, in quantity at least, the results of rescue opera- tions following discoveries on building sites, road works and the like (not to mention illicit excavations), have been equally impressive and in some cases, as at Thebes, they have been of outstanding importance. Their supervision and the resulting commitments of study and publication represent a substantial part of the total archaeological effort. With these and attendant administrative tasks the staff of the Greek Archaeological Service (its headquarters now housed in new offices adjoining the Byzantine Museum) has been coping manfully, despite the sudden super- annuation of a number of its senior figures under new retirement rules for the civil service. From the two- part Chronika section of vol. 18 of their periodical 'ApZato2oy Kd0 AEdtiov (ADelt), published in I965 but reporting activities of I962, I have summarised some discoveries not previously available for Archaeo- logical Reports (AR). Through the kindness of their Publications Office I have had access to reports covering the year 1963, forthcoming in vol. 19. I am also indebted to them for the loan of photographs. Another main source has been the Ergon of the Archaeological Society (A.S.) reporting the excava- tions it sponsored in 1964, published in April with a promptness that places us in great debt to the secre- tary, Professor A. Orlandos. He has kindly lent a number of photographs here reproduced. Some information on other recent Greek excavations has been copied from the daily press. For accounts of their latest excavations which they have communicated, and for photographs, my thanks are due to: the Directors and staff of the other foreign schools; Professor C. Blegen, Mr E. Higgs and Lord William Taylour, concerning their operations in joint enterprises with Greek archaeologists; and, finally, to those who excavated under the sponsorship of the British School at Lefkandi (see under Central Greece and Euboea), Saliagos (Cyclades) and Kythera (Other Aegean Islands). Other field-work sponsored by the School is reported under Perachora (Corinthia and Argolis) and Knossos (Crete). Out- side Greece, a party from the School returned to Tocra in Libya in September 1964 to work on the deposit of Archaic Greek pottery in preparation for publication (see AR 1963-64, 31-32). A further excavation campaign is planned for the autumn of 1965. ATHENS AND ATTICA National Museum. A further room opened in the sculpture gallery in the summer of 1964 is devoted to works of the fourth century. The bronze youth from Antikythera is its centre-piece, round which are grouped both original works, such as the head of Hygieia from Tegea, and replicas of the Roman period. The first room assigned to the collection of bronzes (apart from the Carapanos collection, through which it is entered) has also been opened. The display covers the Geometric and Archaic periods, represented mainly by the finds from the old excavations on the Acropolis and at Olympia. An illustrated guide to the prehistoric collections by Agnes Sakellariou and G. Papathanasopoulos has been published (1964) in English and Greek editions. The appearance of a definitive catalogue of the Minoan and Mycenaean seals by Mrs Sakellarioul as a volume of the corpus edited by F. Matz and H. Biesantz was another notable event. Byzantine Museum. Routine activities of the Museum have of late been overshadowed by the important international exhibition in the Zappeion under the auspices of the Council of Europe, in the organisation of which and in the preparation of the elaborate catalogue-Byzantine Art: An European Art (Athens, I964)-the staff were much involved. But there have been some important acquisitions, in- cluding a sixteenth-century stole with the Twelve Feasts and other subjects in gold thread embroidery and, forming part of the N. Antonopoulos bequest, a small icon of the Maries at the Tomb, of good late Palaeologan style (Fig. I). Acropolis Museum. On the 8th December, with the completion of the rearrangement of the two remain- ing rooms by I. Meliades, the reorganised Museum was formally inaugurated. In an effective display, Room 5 houses the surviving figures of the Gigan- tomachy pediment of the Peisistratid Hekatompedon: the two terminal giants at the ends of the long wall and the other figures on an isolated plinth in the centre of the room. The dismounting and re- assembly of the Athena has fully justified Payne's comment that, as previously restored, this figure seemed too tall; for the upper section was found to be separated from the lower by a length of rope caught between them! Meliades's improved restoration, which includes the entire aegis, gives the head a more downward tilt. This warrants the relegation of the Enceladus of the previous restoration to a secondary position, more to the right, and the assignment to Athena's victim of one of the isolated feet. This revision and the identification of the left hand of Zeus 1 Die Minoischen und AMykenischen Siegel des Nationalmuseums in Athen (Berlin, 1964).</page><page sequence="2">4 A. H. S. MEGAW FIG. I holding a thunderbolt necessitates a crowded ten- figure composition, appropriate for a battle-scene. In the same room 'Antenor's Kore' is seen free- standing for the first time, in a setting spacious enough for its great size, and no longer mounted in Antenor's base. In an alcove, some of the smaller Acropolis marble sculptures are displayed, together with a selection of the excellent vases, pinakes and other finds from Meliades's excavation of the Sanctuary of the Nymph (AR I957, 5; BCH 82, 657-665). Room 6 is devoted to works of the severe style and here pride of place is given to the 'Kritian boy' (head and body now proved beyond doubt to belong together), the kore dedicated by Euthydikos (still in two parts) and the fine horse with turned head (697) now without its old iron supports. The preparation of a guide to the museum by Meliades is reported to be well advanced. Acropolis. In a notable contribution to Acropolis studies published in 1964 (AE 1961, 61-158), Miss C. Karadara argues that the functions of the Nike temple (and its predecessor) were to house the xoanon of Athena and to enshrine the supposed burial-place of Erechtheus; also that the central scene of the Parthenon frieze represents Erechtheus offering to Cecrops the image's first peplos, thereby founding the Panathenaia. South Slope. The work of rehabilitation has con- tinued between the Asklepieion and the Acropolis entrance and N. Platon has reported (ADelt 19 Chr) a number of discoveries in this area in 1963. Of several wells excavated, the most productive had been in use from LH II to LH IIIA2. In quantity and quality the pottery it contained constitutes one of the outstanding Mycenaean finds in the Acropolis area. Many of the restorable vessels are plain, but the repertory of the decorated vases and fragments is very rich. The large pit used as a bronze foundry discovered by Koumanoudis was re-excavated and studied. The initial installations date from the fourth century B.c. and were evidently used for casting bronze statues of large size. Fragments of clay moulds were found, together with much slag and ash. In 1964, the work proceeded in the area of the Stoa of Eumenes. Demolition of houses in the area east of the theatre of Dionysus has produced numerous capitals and architectural blocks, many of them evidently from the scene building; also fragmentary inscriptions and sculptures, including the torso of a Lapith from one of the Parthenon metopes. Farther south, at the intersection of R. Galli (Karyatidon) and Kavallioti Streets, a well preserved Roman bath, arranged round a central circular hall with remains of its mosaic floor, came to light during building operations (Fig. 2). Below it, parts of a courtyard house were exposed, retaining at one point a section of pebble mosaic floor (P. Stravropoulos in ADelt 19 Chr). Farther west in Kavallioti Street, beyond the junction with Erechtheiou Street, a stretch of ancient roadway leading south to the "'Aa6E HfMlat came to light as the result of the laying of a telephone cable and, beyond it, a number of Geo- metric graves. Excavated by Stavropoulos, these graves, which nearly all held cremations, yielded 19 amphorae and 60o smaller vases (Kathimerini 24.7.1964). This cemetery evidently extended far- ther south, for beyond the line of the Themistoclean wall two Late Geometric burials and a cremation with horse figurines and a well-preserved toy chariot were earlier reported by Stavropoulos at Meidani Street 12-14. Nearby, at Dimitrakopoulou Street 85, he reports the discovery of a pyre containing 5 restorable lekythoi of good fifth-century style: 3 r.f., one with Athena offering a trumpet with both hands, and two white (ADelt 19 Chr). At no. 50 in the same street a good fourth-century grave relief (mother and daughter with jewel-box) has been found in almost perfect condition during foundation excavations (Kathimerini 9.5.1965). Agora Area. In connection with the study of the private houses of the Greek and Roman periods found in the American excavations, a re-examination has been made by W. Graham of a group of houses first excavated in 1892-97 by the German Institute between the Areopagus and the Pnyx, covering the period from the fourth century B.c. to the fifth or sixth century A.D. These houses illustrate the modesty of Athenian domestic architecture in both plan and furnishings. Mosaic floors occur only occasionally throughout their history and colonnaded courtyards are confined to the Roman phases of some</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 5 of the larger houses. The most pretentious is that in the area identified by D6rpfeld as the 'Ennea- krunosplatz', for the building to which this courtyard belongs is now seen to be a normal house with a long history extending deep into Roman times. On the north slope of the Areopagus exploration was completed in and around the ruinous church of St Dionysios the Areopagite, which proved to be of the sixteenth century. No structural remains were found of an earlier church, the existence of which is nevertheless attested by a papal bull of 12o9. North and west of the church are the ruins of the Arch- bishop's Palace, frequently mentioned by fifteenth- to eighteenth-century travellers. The only vestiges of classical buildings found were the tenuous remains of houses of the Hellenistic period. The sanctuary of the Eumenides and the meeting-place of the Council of the Aeropagus must therefore be sought elsewhere. The remains of the small temple found just west of Theseion Square are identified in a recent report by the late J. Threpsiades and E. Vanderpool as Themistocles's Sanctuary of Artemis Aristoboule (ADelt 19, 26 ff.). To the north-east of the Agora, at Christokopidou 21, Stavropoulos reports a fragment of a classical building fronting a street and a small deposit of sixth- to fifth-century vases, including a Panathenaic amphora with wrestlers (ADelt 19 Chr). Kerameikos. The exploration of the area behind the tomb-buildings on the south side of the Sacred Way was continued by the German Institute under F. Willemsen. Excavating between the Eukoline mound (AA 1932, I93) and the modern Piraeus Street, Miss B. Schl6rb discovered various features of the early cemetery: two walled tombs and seven small burial mounds of the early fourth century; to the east, a small children's cemetery with burials from 450-400 B.C.; a burial mound of around 530 B.C. and isolated Geometric graves over the whole area. Outstanding finds were two similar Classical stelai, inscribed with the names 'Lissos' and 'Eupheros' probably two brothers, found above their respective graves. The bases were missing and only the upper part of the stele of Lissos is preserved, with traces of a painted fillet. The larger stele of Eupheros (ht. I.47 m.) (Fig. 3) was also painted: lions in the pediment, palmettes on the acroteria and the ends of a filet between them, blue ground to the figure. The relief, a boy contemplating the strigil in his left hand, has affinity with the 'Island' group of stelai and is datable soon after 430 B.c. Plato's Academy. In the 'Revma Profitou Daniil', to the east, drain-construction exposed two cre- mations in plain amphorae with interesting associated vases of seventh-century date. Among these are two Protocorinthian pyxides as well as Attic pieces, including a jug with Gorgon and a skyphos with a Potnia theron and sphinxes; also plain miniatures of domestic vessels. Ambelokipoi. Two deposits, the one of 17 bronze statuettes of the second to third centuries A.D. (Herakles, Poseidon, and a larger Eros among them), and the second of fourth century A.D. lamps, have been found during laying of a water main in Panayi Kyriakou Street (Kathimerini 9.7.1964). Kallithea. The vases from five more graves of the FIG. 2</page><page sequence="4">6 A. H. S. MEGAW ripe Geometric period, discovered during construc- tion of a drain under Theseus Street, have been published by V. Kallipolitis (ADelt 19 Chr). Thorikos. Joint Greek-Belgian excavations, started in the autumn of 1963 under V. Kallipolitis and H. Mussche, have re-examined the slopes of Velatouri, the hill behind the theatre. Close to the tholos tomb discovered by Stais, two more Mycenaean tombs were found; the first of apsidal form (5 x 2 m.) with the dromos on one of the long sides, and the second rectangular. In the first, below a layer with fragments of vases ranging from the seventh to the mid-fifth century and suggesting a hero-cult, were found a restorable Mycenaean alabastron and other material, some of it as late as the IIIA period. The single vase in the second, a one-handled conical cup of IIIB type, is not to be connected with the first use of the tomb. Trials on the west slope, where Geometric grave goods had been found (Hesperia 30, 299-304), yielded a restorable Protogeometric krater- iskos on a high foot from an area much disturbed by later cremation burials. North-west of the theatre a length of street was uncovered with a house of the Classical period on one side and, on the other, a concentration plant for a mineral ore (about half lead but containing silver also), dating from the fourth century B.c., according to associated pottery. Tests made after clearance in the theatre itself revealed a floor, datable to the second half of the fifth century B.C., which passes under the lowest seats. They also estab- lished that the enlargement of the auditorium dates from the second half of the fourth century (ADelt 19 Chr). Brauron. The structural work on the Museum has been completed, bringing nearer the day when the late I. Papadimitriou's important finds from the santuary of Artemis will again be visible. Mean- while, Lilly G. Kahil, to whom he entrusted the publication of the vases, has supplemented her first selection (Antike Kunst: Beiheft I) with a study of the curious krateriskoi of the first half of the fifth century, bearing scenes connected with the cult of Artemis (Antike Kunst 8, 20-32). Eleusis. I. Travlos (A.S.), assisted by Mrs M. Anagnostopoulou, has continued excavation of the priests' houses of the Roman period immediately within the "AaTv6E HN'Aat. It is now clear that there are two units with separate entrances, each with its own courtyard. They were constructed of mud- brick above a stone socle and were destroyed in the third century. Megara. G. Gruben's architectural account of the Fountain House, which was to have accompanied the late I. Papadimitriou's excavation report, has now been published separately (ADelt 19, 37 if.). Salamis. Tomb-looting in a known Mycenaean cemetery led to the excavation in 1964 by K. Davaras of 9 chamber-tombs by the Gymnasium. One which was intact and had been used for many burials contained no less than 95 vases of IIIB and IIIC types. In another was found a Minoan seal stone (lion attacking bull) of LM IIIA type, evidently an heirloom (Kathimerini 1/10o/64). FIG. 3</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 7 Aegina. V. Kallipolitis reports the excavation of an intact Archaic chamber tomb of the 6th century to the south-east of the old Kapodistria Orphanage. The chamber contained two large limestone sarco- phagi filled with remains of numerous burials, and four small ones. One of the former was inscribed KAENA JAMOSSO, datable around 550 B.C. by the letter- forms, but an Attic b.f. lekythos, an early work of the Haimon painter, found with two Corinthian pyxides and a glass alabastron on its cover, dates its last use to the early fifth century. Two lekythoi found on the other large sarcophagus are even later. Among the contents of one of the small ones (no. 5) were two Attic skyphoi of the third quarter of the sixth century and two faience figurines of Egyptian type. No. 6, at a somewhat lower level, contained eleven small vases, all except one Corinthian, and none later than c. 550 B.C. (ADelt 19 Chr). CORINTHIA AND ARGOLIS Perachora. Continuing, with a view to publication, the study of buildings excavated by Payne for the British School, R. Tomlinson has re-examined the house remains between the lake and the Heraion. Those shown on the published survey (Perachora I, pl. 137) have suffered considerably but in the eastern section, around house B, several sets of foundations were found intact, and one house, overlaid in antiquity by a later one, gave more scope for study. The earlier walls proved to belong to a westward-facing megaron of strictly rectangular plan; the absence of tile fragments suggest that it was thatched. A bronze 'spit' (Fig. 4) was found on the floor, which sealed a quantity of Protocorinthian pottery. The overlying structure appears to have been a courtyard house: it has a clearly defined andron with raised platforms for the couches. Nothing later than the Archaic period was found. North-east of Payne's house B were traced the walls of at least three houses of a simple courtyard type with two rooms each at the northern end, regularly built and probably dating from the fourth century. More massive foundations, immediately adjacent, proved to be the euthynteria of a small temple with cella and porch (probably in antis) facing west. The construction is similar to that of the stoa by the harbour, now published by J. Coulton in BSA 59, I00oo ff. Soundings by Coulton in the 'Agora' area near the harbour provided a terminus post quem in the sixth century for the polygonal walls that enclose it on the seaward side and are its earliest feature. Kenchreai. The excavations at this port of ancient Corinth, sponsored by the American School, were resumed in the summer of 1964 by E. Ramage and R. Scranton. Abundant indications of pre-Roman activity were found on the hill north of the centre of the harbour, the top of which was found to have been quarried away during the fourth century B.C., after earlier occupation. On the quarry-bed were found pottery, roof-tiles, and figurines, some of them Archaic. At the south end of the hill extensive remains were uncovered of what appears to be a fuller's establishment, which the associated pottery indicates went out of use early in the third century B.C. The structures adjoining the east mole have been further examined (general plan in Hesperia 33, 13 if.). In the complex of concrete and poros foundations at the south-west end, which continues in the sea, the earliest structures may well be Hellenistic, though deposits of this period have not been reached. The different (north-east-south-west) orientation of the later buildings here (found also in other areas) appears to be at least as early as the first century B.C. Traces of walls of this second period underlie the adjoining Brick Building, erected around the end of the first century A.D. The latter, now completely excavated, but of uncertain use, includes a peristyle court with spacious rooms opening off its narrow ends, that opposite the twin entrances preserving its mosaic floor. On the south-west quay, the remains of ware- houses surviving under water were found to have lost their floors, though on the quay in front of them is still preserved a rough stone paving edged by ashlar kerbs. A trench dug on land established that the warehouses had a total frontage of at least 120 m. The massive structures in deeper water beyond them were found to preserve in places three courses of heavy poros blocks, the top of the uppermost in about 2 m. of water. No recognisable floors were found but, in the top course, adjoining compartments were connected by narrow openings (c. 0"50 m. wide) each furnished with slots for a pair of dam-boards. Closer to the shore, the partially submerged FIG. 4</page><page sequence="6">8 A. H. S. MEGAW foundations behind the warehouses were 'swept'. The main structure, to the south-east of the basilica church, measures about Io by 8 m. and has a large apse at the south-east and a vestibule at the opposite end, from which a flight of marble-lined steps descends to a floor about I m. below sea-level. The floor of the apse is paved with slabs of vari-coloured marble and that of the main quadrangular space with simple geometric mosaic. The debris sealed by a later floor at sea-level was partly excavated. It contained a wooden chair or bench, many fragments of ivory carved as miniature capitals, bases and mouldings of various kinds, fragments of tortoise-shell engraved with figures, and large amounts of opus sectile. The latter employs glass as well as marble and one slab depicts ibis walking in a swamp with lotus and papyrus plants. The excavators suggest that this and other material found with it, as well as the buildings in the vicinity, may have some connection with the sanctuary of Isis mentioned by Pausanias. The building at first thought to be a temple, some 750 m. to the north, has been revealed as a large monument of undetermined purpose, some I 0 50 m. square, built of heavy poros blocks and faced with marble. Above a marble step and bench, rose a podium crowned by a cornice, above which a fine guilloche moulding evidently marked the base of a tall rectangular shaft, in turn crowned by a finely carved cornice (Fig. 5). Numerous fragments of a long Latin inscription were found. The monument replaced an earlier structure of poros blocks faced with plaster. FIG. 5 Corinth. A notable find of the American School's 1964 excavations at Corinth, directed by H. Robinson, was a large deposit of Corinthian pottery of the fifth century B.C. of types hitherto hardly known. This was found by chance near the Vrysoula Spring and evidently derives from a sanctuary (many thymia- teria) which has not ye been located. There are funnel-mouth lekythoi bearing rather crude animals FIG. 6 and birds painted in black with incised details, while other vessels revive the filling ornaments of the old Corinthian style (Fig. 6). Work in the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore on the north slope of Acrocorinth was resumed by R. Stroud. The eastern limit was established, while beside a large terrace wall to the north two rooms with beddings for couches were found, evidently modest dining halls. Extending the excava- tion westward, a Roman Stoa facing up-hill was found and above it rock- cut steps suggesting it served as scaenae frons for a theatral area. Among terracotta figurines (women holding pigs) and miniature votives, the finds include an Attic b.f. epinetron of the late sixth century, fragments of large- scale terracotta sculpture and a num- ber of small clay pinakes inscribed before firing with a name in the genitive (Fig. 7). Mrs Saul Weinberg excavated two rectangular potters' kilns, one of which just outside the city to the north-east adjoined the sixth or fifth century B.c. establishment dug in 1939, but proved to be of Roman date and ill-preserved. It had been used, probably in the mid-fourth century, to make tiles of various sorts and discs for the hypocausts of bath-houses. The second kiln, somewhat later in date, lies west of the city near Kokkinovrysi. In this case the floor over the firing chamber was well preserved (Fig. 8). Fragments of the roof-tiles of several varieties that had been made here were found.</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 9 :: : i ::: : .. i ii-iiii-ii-iii;iii- iiiii ......... ii -..... i-iii -iii:- ... :::: :: ::: --: ..-.-. :--- i_: - _i- - :ii:i: ii: iii-i:i :~-:::- :-- ::-:::-:::::--::-:::: --- :-: : i:-i i-i --:--- : i ::: :::::::: ---- ::: :: ? i -i- i:: _i::i-:i---: i-:: i:--: i--:--i--i:-i-i:i-ii-i-:- :ii ? ::i:::i:j_:::::::j:. i:il:::::::::::::::_:i : -::: : - :- :: :: : :::: : ::: : : i_:: :-: -... .. :-:: i: : . : : : :- :i_:: -.-., :: : - - : :: ::::: :: ::::::: : : : ::::::: -' : : : ... :: : ...::. i-j-.-::-i::i:-: .-.... :-i:i-:::--::::ii:::i::-_: ---.-_ _:::::::_i::i-iii i::::: :: . : : .. ---- : :: ::'i:::: :::::-::-: :': L::-::::i:::- FIG. 7 The marble head of a small Late Archaic Kouros, rather battered, found accidentally in March 1964 at the locality 'Kalderimi', 3 km. east of Old Corinth, is now in the Museum there. Nemea. During the spring of 1964, C. Williams re-examined the buildings partially excavated by the American School in I924 and 1927. The long Hellen- istic structure that underlies the basilica to the south of the temple of Zeus, a rect- angle 86 by 2o m. with a central longitudinal wall, was found to have had five separate entrances opening from a roadway along the south side, within each of which small vestibules pro- truded into the rooms. In almost all those on the south side of the building were found remains of food and dining wares datable to the end of the fourth and the early third century. The building appears to be a xenon that served also for official purposes connected with the games. The Laconian roof-tiles of this building include ridge tiles of unusual form. The ridge pan-tiles are, as it were, folded over the ridge, and the ridge cover-tiles conform and straddle the ridge with- out any added embellishment. An antefix, not from this building, was found in the area, ornamented in relief with a crater flanked by satyrs (Fig. 9). Beneath the floor of the xenon were found the remains of a kiln where the roof-tiles for the fourth-century temple of Zeus were made, to judge by the fabric and dimen- sions of the fragments found. Of the baptistery to the north of the basilica over- lying the xenon, only the circular kolymbethra was revealed in the original excavations. Now com- pletely cleared, the baptistery proves to be almost square in plan and to be enclosed on three sides by an ambulatory with benches along its outer walls. It was built subsequently to the basilica, probably in the late fifth century. Between the basilica and the temple, the remains of a classical building, 13 by 22 m. with two founda- tions for interior piers or columns were re-examined. An offset in the poros foundations of the north wall indicates the position of the entrance door. Con- forming with the line of this faqade, the foundations of two other buildings have been exposed to the east. Facing the temple, these buildings may have formed the southern limit of the sanctuary proper, leaving the bath and xenon outside it. A test trench dug against the west end of the temple disclosed that the ground level to be associated with the Archaic temple was the same as the floor level of the crypt of its fourth-century successor. Mycenae. Acropolis. Continuing his excavations on the north-west slope, G. Mylonas (A.S.) established that this area, first occupied in Middle Helladic times, was still closely packed with houses in LH IIIC, with a central paved yard whence alleys, stepped where FIG. 8</page><page sequence="8">10 o A. H. S. MEGAW FIG. 9 necessary, led to other parts of the Acropolis. Con- solidation of the walls of the corridor P along the adjoining sector of the north wall of the Citadel per- mitted its excavation throughout its length of 28 50 m. to the paved floor, on which IIIC as well as earlier pottery was found (Fig. io). A fragment of an Archaic inscription was found built into a Hellenistic wall in this area. South-east of the Lion Gate, the area of Schlie- mann's great trench was investigated. Here, another access route was discovered, leading to the north side of the hill and constructed towards the end of the IIIB period. A section of the known predecessor of the Great Ramp was exposed, as well as part of the yet earlier wall retaining an MH route to the summit. The cistern exposed by the early excavations in this area was found to have been built in the third century B.C. upon a fallen Mycenaean wall. In the North-east Extension, the construction of which can now be fixed towards the end of the IIIB period, a small room was excavated by its south wall containing a number of broken pithoi and, among other objects, 9 vases and a stone bowl with three feet (on these, see now Buchholz inJdI 78, 1-77). Outside it more pottery was found and part of a bath-tub, the first from Mycenae. On the north side of the Extension the Mycenaean building B was completely excavated. On the floors of the rooms, two of well- preserved plaster and another of pebbles, late IIIB to early IIIC pottery was found. Beside this building, a section of the alley connecting the Palace with the Extension was exposed, where, together with frag- mentary pottery, was found part of an ivory plaque ornamented with figure-of-eight shields. The 'drain' through the north wall of the Extension was also examined and proved to be a sally-port. Mycenae. 'Citadel House'. Lord William Taylour, working under the general direction of Prof. G. Mylonas, excavated the remaining section of this complex against the inside of the south sector of the Citadel wall, after an interval since 1962 (AR 1962-63, I3-15). Hellenistic walls were encountered close to the surface; as elsewhere in the area they were planned and removed. Below these, in the great mass of earth drifted down from higher areas of the acropolis, no other structures of post-Mycenaean date were found; but the few sherds of Protogeometric, Geo- metric, Archaic and Classical wares found attest the continuous occupation of higher sections of the Citadel. Several cist-graves cut into the Mycenaean remains were excavated. One contained a poorly preserved child-burial with seven complete vases, painted in that Sub-Mycenaean style classified by V. Desborough as Early Protogeometric: a stirrup-jar, 4 lekythoi, a small jug and a miniature cup. This grave also contained several bronze objects: two long pins, three semicircular fibulae and a finger-ring with spiral finials. Over another cist-grave there was evidence of extensive burning, leaving the stones bleached, the skeleton burnt and the surrounding area covered with ash. A third cist-grave of the Protogeometric period contained a partly disturbed burial with a large, plain amphora by the head and a painted lekythos set in the mouth of the vessel. This grave also contained FIG. 10</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE II a plain bronze ring and an iron pin with a bulbous swelling in bronze near the head. The Mycenaean remains uncovered comprise structures of two distinct phases: to the first belong the massive basement walls of the Mycenaean IIIB period, following which, around the transition to IIIC, there was a general reconstruction to which numerous walls of lighter, rubble construction belong. In contrast to previous campaigns, this season produced less evidence of a violent destruction at the end of IIIB, but where it was observed, IIIC sherds were found above the destruction level and not in it. In various parts of the site some very fine but frag- mentary pottery of the 'Close Style' of the IIIC period came to light. Some of these, from a krater, are particularly noteworthy for their bichrome decoration (Fig. ix). They were found in a room in the west part of the site, the centre of which was occupied by a circular structure built of rough stones, at present unexplained. Elsewhere, an important pictorial vase of the IIIC period was also found: a very large four- handled jar, of which the greater part is preserved, decorated with horses, a foal and birds (Fig. Ia). The layout of the earlier buildings of more massive construction, which in this respect match the South House (adjoining the 'Citadel House' on the north) and the House of the Warrior Vase, has not been fully disclosed. In the debris associated with their destruction a group of almost complete, though shattered, vases was found at one point, none of them later than IIIB. Another sector yielded a complete IIIB krater which had a jug inside it, and close to it a ring-vase of the same period. Mycenae. Lion Gate. A new reconstruc- tion of the Lion relief by P. Astr6m and B. Blome proposes horns of consecration or a pair of birds as alternatives for the crowning feature (Opuscula Atheniensia V, 159-191). A study by S. Iakovides of the threshold of the Lion Gate has also lately appeared (AE 1961, I80 if.). Mycenae. Gortsoulia. At this locality 2 km. north-east of the Acropolis, G.

Following-up the discovery of the two passages leading to springs outside the lower enclosure of the acropolis, N. Verdelis has excavated the areas within the wall at the points where they were entered. Below some 3"90 m. of material introduced in the Hellenistic levelling of the area, three Mycenaean strata were observed: the earliest to be connected with the destruction at the end of the IIIB period and the last with the final twelfth- century destruction. Mycenaean structures FIG. II of three building phases subsequent to the erection of the wall were found, and, in the layer next to the rock, seven burials without any datable material (ADelt 19 Chr). Argos. Cleaning and soundings on the Larissa were undertaken by the French School in 1964 to clarify the chronology of the ramparts. The Hellenic wall at the north-east angle of the inner citadel was freed from the debris concealing it. An unpublished inscription from the south flank concerning an Argive etLaywyevt and some Byzantine architectural blocks from the summit were removed to the Museum.

The discovery of remains of an Early Christian basilica with mosaic floors at 'Palaeopyrga', I -5 km. from the theatre, is also reported (ADelt 19 Chr). LACONIA TO ACHAIA Sparta. Resuming his explorations on the acropolis C. Christou (A.S.) re-examined the so-called Round Building (see AJA 8, 1893, 410 ff.), which now seems to have been a semicircular retaining-wall limiting a cult area on the south side only. Within it was found a hearth and a pit and drain, doubtless used in sacrifices. The excavator assigns these and the retaining-wall to the fifth century B.C. and suggests a connection with the Gasepton, a sanctuary of Earth (Pausanias iii 12.8), in preference to the first exca- vator's identification with the circular building set up by Epimenides near the Scias (P. iii I2.I ). In the area immediately to the north, a massive structure built without mortar, in part of polygonal masonry and in part of header-and-stretcher con- struction, was also examined and a deep sounding made in one of its angles. At 3"40 m. a thick burnt layer was reached containing roof-tiles with stamps of 2nd century B.C. type, suggesting a building of public character; also a life-size female statue of bronze of Severan type (Fig. 13). Though the face has been intentionally mutilated, it suggests identifi- cation with Julia Mamaea. Work on the Tripolis road, on the outskirts of the town, destroyed part of what appears to have been a secular basilica of the fourth century A.D. The remainder, excavated by Miss K. Demakopoulou, includes part of the main hall ending in an apse at the east end, both with mosaic floors (interlace designs and occasional birds), and a south 'aisle' separated and divided by light partitions (ADelt 19 Chr). Mani. N. Drandakis (A.S.) has examined the remains of a basilican church with three apses, each three-sided, on the fortified peninsula of Tigani near Mezapos. The lateral apses served isolated para- bemata communicating through doors with the aisles. One grey marble column is visible on the site and pedestal bases taken from it support the altar tables in churches at Mezapos (Ascension) and Stavri (St Nicholas), in the latter case accompanied by one of the capitals. Drandakis has published the twelfth century frescoes in the Episkopi church near Stavri (including a notable series of scenes from the life of St George), together with the somewhat earlier paintings in that of Ai-Strategos at Epano Boularioi.2 Messene (Mavromati). The whole circuit of the Hellenistic Agora has now been uncovered by A. Orlandos (A.S.) with the excavation of the buildings forming its south-east corner. These were built on a high retaining wall, as the ground falls away at this point, and little is now preserved above ground- level. Only meagre remains of the colonnade which ringed the agora were found in this area. FIG. 13 Pylos. Palace of Nestor. The American component in the joint exploration of Western Messenia, under the direction of C. Blegen, continued study of the finds from the Palace at Englianos, particularly the pottery and the frescoes, in preparation for the final publication. In addition, a number of supple- 2Bvavtrval TotgoypaIlat r~g Mc ra M IdN (Athens, 1964).</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE I3 mentary tests were dug, most of them in the maze of ruined walls on the slope below the early Throne Room in the south-west building. New light was shed on some of these walls, and one foundation, which can be traced in a diagonal line at the bottom of the slope, may possibly be a sector of the Early Mycenaean circuit wall of which a section was dis- covered in 1959 at the other end of the hill. Soundings along this and other walls yielded numerous sherds, many of which are assignable to LH I and earlier. Peristeria. Following its expropriation, S. Marin- atos (A.S.) resumed his exploration of this hill-top site (see AR 1962-63, I9). A length of the fortifica- tion wall on the accessible south side has been exposed, 2 8o m. wide with rooms against its inner face, and an entrance gate at its western extremity. The excavation of tholos tomb 2 was also completed, yielding fragments of Palace Style amphorae and many attachments of gold leaf each pierced with a single minute hold: bees, disks, etc. More of the gold tassels were found, also gold and silver studs, and fragments of bronze vessels inlaid with gold, silver and niello. Volimidhia. Marinatos (A.S.) has also excavated a number of tombs in the Kephalovryson sector of this cemetery to the north-east of Chora. The earliest and richest was a MH pit-grave with a single con- tracted burial. Apart from four knives and a group of 42 stone arrowheads, there were two dozen vases, some of them of forms previously unknown, including double-cups and a bowl with an internal semi- circular handle bridging the bottom (Fig. x4 a-b). Several Mycenaean chamber tombs, two of them intact, were also excavated, their vases ranging from LH I/IIA to IIIB. Vlachopoulou. A small tholos tomb opened by villagers, the contents of which were saved by the Ephor, N. Yialouris, was also examined by Marinatos (A.S.). With the remains of several burials were three bronze knives and several vases of good quality, none of them earlier than LH IIIA, and including a small crater which was in position on its stand. Olympia. In a further campaign just ended (April 1965), directed by E. Kunze and A. Mallwitz, the exploration of the area between the Octagon and the Stadium has been virtually completed. Below the Roman walls, unpretentious Greek structures came to light, more numerous in the western part and in some cases connecting with foundations previously uncovered. The Classical level here yielded abun- dant bronze and pottery finds and the intensive earlier use of the area is attested by numerous Archaic wells. Forty more of these were cleared and a few have still to be examined. Outstanding in the rich series of finds is the upper part of a ham- mered bronze statue of a winged goddess, a little under life size. The face is well preserved and retains parts of the inlaid eyes (Fig. x5), but the rest is badly buckled. The style of the head and of the drapery folds, as well as the engraved details, place it in the first third of the sixth century. Other bronze finds include a nude male statuette (ht. 19'5 cm.) FIG. 14 a-b with short beard and in the outstretched right hand a dish for offerings, an excellent example of the early severe style attributable to Corinth or Sicyon; a huge lion's paw tripod-foot of fine quality and perfect preservation (ht. 23 cm.); the plating from the neck of a votive column (diam. 73 cm.); and one of the strut sections ending in volutes and palmettes from a tripod-stand of a type found complete at Treben- ischte (AA 1930, 287 f, fig. 13), in this case with the lions' heads turned outwards (Fig. x6). Many additions to the series of Geometric tripod legs and handles, griffin heads and other attachments have also been made. Among the armour found were 20 more helmets, a complete breast-plate with engraved decoration and more shield fragments. Among the pottery are some fine Attic b.f. and r.f. fragments, many of local r.f. fabric and a Late Archaic Attic lekythos with the curious inscription qtA(yopia KaKLtUTO incised on the foot. Of interest for the history of the Zeus temple was the discovery in a late Classical fill of a fragment of the original raking cornice preserving its painted decoration: on the front, meander with chequerboard filling. Elis. N. Yialouris (A.S.) and Miss V. Leon of the Austrian Institute have re-exposed those parts of the South Stoa previously found by the Institute, and have excavated much of the rest. Its dimensions and its subdivision into two sections, the outer one with an interior colonnade, are now clear for the first time. Surviving areas of the later mosaic floor, attesting the use of the inner section as an Early Christian church, have also been fully uncovered. Among pottery of various periods found, Early Hellenistic wares predominated. In the theatre, the</page><page sequence="12">14 A. H. S. MEGAW FIG. 15</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE I5 remainder of the orchestra was cleared, as was a futher section of the auditorium, the slope and external limits of which have now been fixed. Many bronze coins and tesserae were found. Patras. E. Mastrokostas reports that investi- gation of the vault adjoining the church of St Andrew, which contains a holy well, has revealed it as part of a massive brick building with marble floor and wall-revetments: but it is not yet clear whether it had any connection with the original church (ADelt 19 Chr). CENTRAL GREECE AND EUBOEA Thebes. The site at the intersection of Pindar and Antigone Streets where the unique group of cylinder seals came to light in 1963-64, is being expropriated, with other properties adjoining it, so that the Archae- ological Service may uncover more of this central area of the Kadmeia. Preliminary reports on dis- coveries on this and other Theban sites (anticipating that on the 1963 discoveries in ADelt 19 Chr) have been published by the excavators, N. Platon and Mrs E. Stassinopoulou-Touloupa, in Kadmos III, 25 if, and ILN 28/II/64 and 5/12/64- Associated with the massive EH building on this site was a cache of bronze tools in a pot, including a shaft-hole axe of a type found at Poliochni in an early Troy II context. (An EH house at 6I Epameinondas Street has produced numerous restorable vessels.) FIG. 16 The light walls of the lower Mycenaean level retain the EH orientation. The destruction of these earlier Mycenaean buildings ('the first palace'), aligning also with the remains excavated by Keramopoulos in the property to the north, is dated c. 1300 B.c. by burnt floors with early LH IIIB pottery. In the later building, more substantial and differently aligned ('the second palace'), the burnt layer where the cylinders and jewellery were found contained developed IIIB pottery. For the definitive publica- tion of the cylinders the excavators are enlisting the assistance of Miss E. Porada and, for the texts, Jean Nougoyrol. The latter gives readings for the two Cassite cylinders so far published in BCH 88, 778 f. (Cf. A. Falkenstein in Kadmos III, io8 ff.). These are among the latest in the collection, which includes a third millennium example as well as some Mycenaean seals (one of them, Fig. 17). The assembly of the fresco fragments, found in an as yet incompletely excavated lower stratum in the same building, is in hand. They include pictorial subjects. In the site on Pelopidas Street (no. 28) the exca- vators report a different sequence. Here the de- struction with which the linear B tablets are associated is contemporary with that of 'the first palace', c. 1300oo B.C. The earlier Mycenaean 'Arsenal', where the bronze weapons and the ivory colonettes were found, dates from the LH IIIA period. These remains and the adjoining cist-tombs of the earlier MH cemetery are to be preserved in the basement of the building to be erected on this site. Meanwhile, important discoveries have been made on two more Theban building sites (Kathimerini 13/12/64). On one, in Oedipus Street, about 150 m. south of the find-spot of the cylinders, the same excavators have found among Mycenaean walls of light construction, a large number of ivory plaques in burnt condition. This they attribute to the disaster that destroyed 'the first palace', with which the walls are aligned. One group includes large figure-of- eight bosses, whose lobes serve as oculi for volutes bordered by the same motif, much reduced in size but increasing as the spiral opens. This group is suggestive of furniture enrichments. Another series of reliefs, reminiscent of the Enkomi gaming-box in the British Museum, includes a narrow panel filled by a pair of wild goats passing abreast with their heads reversed (Fig. 18), and fragments of a long panel with warriors flanking a sacred tree. On the other new site, some distance to the west, across Epameinondas Street, P. Lazarides has cleared a section of Early Christian mosaic pavement. The part uncovered includes panels with figures personi- fying the months February, April, May and July, and part of another with a hunting scene. These are divided by elaborate interlace borders inter- rupted by inscription panels, one referring to a convert from the worship of the dapetoig OeEa and another naming the mosaicist: Demetrios. Sanctuary of the Cabeiri. The results of the last excavations of the German Institute, directed by Gerda Bruns and centred on the temple and the adjoining theatre, are reported in AA 1964, 231-257.</page><page sequence="14">16 A. H. S. MEGAW FIG. 17 Tanagra. The source of the unique group of pictorial Mycenaean larnakes of which examples have reached collections in Europe and America in recent years (Emily Vermeule, Greece in the Bronze Age, 210o) has now been located by Mrs Vermeule in a looted cemetery at 'Yephyra' on the outskirts of the village of Bratsi near Tanagra. A specimen, lacking the usual representations of mourning women in an early IIIC style, is to be seen in the village, as well as a stirrup-jar said to have been found in the same chamber tomb as one of the pictorial examples (Fig. 19). In all some 25 to 30 are reported to have been found in illicit excavations. Three which were confiscated by the Archaeological Service are pub- lished in JHS 85, 123-148 by Mrs Vermeule. Sanctuary of Ptoios. The French School has con- tinued the programme of cleaning and soundings started in 1963 (preliminary account with plan in BCH 88, 851-864). More has been exposed of the foundations for the line of tripod bases identified on the terrace, below and to the north of the temple. Among the foundation material used for one of the later bases, the polygonal shaft and capital of an Archaic tripod-support were found. On the lower, 'Perdicovrysi' terrace two of the seven compartments of the great cistern have been emptied and the re- taining-wall of the terrace cleared. A sounding against the outside face of the latter revealed traces of what appears to be an earlier roadway. Hosios Loukas. Conservation works undertaken by E. Stikas and M. Chatzidakis (A.S.) in the lower section of the north 'transept' of the Katholikon brought to light on its east wall two features of crucial importance for the structural history of the two churches. The gold ground on the north side of the lunette mosaic (half-length Virgin and Child) was found to cover a wall-face identical with the exteriors of the north church of the Theotokos (Fig. 20o). Secondly, on the lower part of this wall was revealed, behind the marble revetment, part of a fresco com- position representing Joshua and the Angel (Joshua v. 13-15), which clearly antedates the construction of the Katholikon. The previously accepted view that the smaller Theotokos church was the later of the two is now untenable, and the question arises whether it can be identified with that of St Barbara started by Luke of Steiris himself c. A.D. 950. Euboea--Lefkandi. Trial excavations of the British School in June 1964, with M. Popham and H. Sackett in charge, confirmed surface indications that 'Xeropolis' hill by the shore retains, at least at one point, occupation layers down to the Geometric period super- imposed on Mycenaean and earlier remains. Two sectors of the elongated flat-topped hill were tested (Fig. 2x), one towards the east end, the other towards the west; the tests extended from the north to south slopes of the hill, amounting to a partial cross-section of FIG. 18 the site at these points. From these tests it was learnt that the shape of the hill has altered con- siderably since its last occupation. The centre of the area has been eroded so that bed-rock is only about a metre below the surface, whereas the ex- treme edges of the hill, paricularly to the north, are better preserved and in some cases are covered with a fair depth of surface wash. In the limited areas tested this season, this extensive erosion of the summit has removed all trace (apart from a surface scatter of sherds) of Geometric and Protogeometric occupation, except on the north-east edge of the hill. Here, in the case of trench 1, the deposit containing Geometric pottery was sealed below a very hard</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE I7 floor with a clay oven upon it of LH IIIC date. One of the walls was founded immediately upon an earlier wall of rather massive construction associated with early Mycenaean and MH sherds. These walls might well have been part of a fortification complex. Three further tests made at intervals higher up the hill disclosed walls which all appeared to belong to the LH IIIC period. Opposite these trenches, on the south slope of the site towards the sea, three more tests were made. Trench e on the very edge of the cliff produced a deposit of LH IIIC pots mostly fragmentary on an ill-defined earth floor. The floor overlay a wall associated with LH IIIC sherds which was resting on on earlier complex of walls in which two periods of construction could be traced. All this building activity appeared to have taken place within the FIG. 19 compacted level which in turn lay beneath a stratum of large stones. Below the Geometric level was found a Protogeometric deposit nearly I m. in total depth, characterised by pendent-semicircle bowls and by bowls with isolated concentric circles. In this same test, LH IIIC material was found immediately below the Protogeometric. Trench m, 5 m. higher up the slope, produced a similar Geometric level, though more in the nature of a surface deposit, and immedi- ately below it appeared LH IIIC. Trench n, a further 5 m. up the hill, revealed walls of LH IIIC date only a little below the surface. On very much the same axis, trials a and d were made on the south edge of the site overlooking the sea. Trench a, nearest the edge, while producing a well-constructed wall, apparently of LH III date, was so disturbed by a large pit that it was abandoned and trench d was opened up immediately adjacent to it. Some pebble 'floors' were found close down below the surface, but below them until bed rock, some I - 5o m. down, the pottery was Middle Helladic, apart from a small intrusive pit. Of the trials near the west end of the site, the most informative and productive were those nearest the north and south edges of the plateau. That at the north end, trench c, produced a deposit of early LH IIIC vases in a clear destruction level of burnt wood and mud brick. Outstanding among the vases was a large straight-sided alabastron with a frieze of animals depicted in white on a black ground around its waist (Fig. 22). Among the creatures represented are two griffins feeding their young in a nest, a sphinx and a stag. A stirrup vase with applied white decoration and a deep bowl with solid dark paint inside and out, were among the vases found with the alabastron, which itself had the inverted foot and stem of a kylix inserted in its neck as an improvised lid. Below the clay floor on which these pots lay, was a deep fill containing LH IIIC pottery with at least one intermediate clay floor. This fill lay in part in the angle formed by two walls, both having a pronounced batter. In this angle and over I m. below the present top of the walls was found a clay FIG. 20</page><page sequence="16">I8 A. H. S. MEGAW LH IIIC period; the stratum below was, to judge from the sherds found in it, of MH date. Higher up the south slope, trench b uncovered a large pit, or cutting, dug down into EH levels and filled with a grey ashy deposit containing much animal bone and LH IIIC pottery. The same loose grey ashy deposit, found to be characteristic of the IIIC levels over the whole of the site, appeared also in trench p some Io m. above trench b. These tests revealed a considerable town of LH IIIC date, which covered practically the whole of the hill and which lasted long enough to produce massive deposits of refuse and to have at least three building phases. The Geometric and Protogeo- metric occupation levels, though largely eroded away, may well be preserved along much of the north- east edge of the hill, and it is here that a systematic excavation is planned for 1965. It is hoped that it will clarify the possibility that 'Xeropolis', abandoned before the Archaic period, represents Old Eretria. Eretria. In 1964 a Swiss expedition led by K. Schefold in association with the Greek Archaeo- logical Service began joint excavations at Eretria. The most notable discovery reported was the result of soundings in the Sanctuary of Apollo, which reached a level with structural remains of the Geometric period, the earliest yet found on the site. Among other previously excavated areas, the Gymna- sium and the West Gate were re-examined. The excavation of the Thesmophorion on the steep slope of the Acropolis has been completed by K. Davaras who also discovered a second small sanctuary in a similar position. This consists of a small cella with an altar before it, a temenos wall in part con- structed in polygonal masonry, and terraces on the slope below. In one corner of the temenos a large deposit of Archaic vases was found, many of them complete; and elsewhere numerous terracotta figur- ines (Kathimerini 5/II/64). In the lower town, on a site which was to be built on, Davaras also excavated a substantial house of the Archaic period which was rebuilt after destruction in the Persian sack. It has an internal court with a well. In its last, Hellenistic phase it was converted into a potters' establishment (Kathimerini 9/8/64). EPIRUS AND THE IONIAN ISLANDS S.

Their test cut through pottery levels containing some ancient hearths to a series of four superimposed Palaeolithic levels, in the lowest of which work had to be discontinued without reaching the bottom of the deposit. In the uppermost of these levels, associated with a fine yellowish deposit with some stones, the tool assemblage included backed blades, scalene triangles, crescent awls, shouldered points, burins and scrapers, and numerous micro-burins. Some of these types occurred in the Seidi cave near Levadhia, but Higgs finds a closer comparison with the upper layers at Romanelli near Lecce, dated by radio-carbon to about 12,ooo years ago, in a cold phase towards the end of the last glaciation. In the lower of the two Upper-Palaeolithic deposits the micro-burins were not found, nor the geometric forms. In the third level, a micro-Mousterian industry with many artefacts was encountered, unexpectedly, since small Mousterian industries are rare. Apart from small Mousterian-type points and some small scrapers with step retouch, it is a coarse assemblage without the thin blades of the upper deposits. Finally, in the lowest level reached, a Levallois-Mousterian industry was found. It yielded numerous points, side-scrapers, D-scrapers, tortoise cores and Levallois flakes, all heavily patinated. This industry is akin to that identified in the 1963 trial in the adjacent valley to the west, at the site now known by the locality name 'Kokkinopilos', of which a preliminary account has appeared in Proc. Preh. Soc. 1964, 199-244. Mesopotamos. Further investigations by S. Dakaris (A.S.) in the forecourt of the Nekyomanteion have centred on the square basement room to the east of the outer entrance. A test excavation to the floor, some 2 m. below the general level, disclosed a pier of burnt brick evidently one of several that supported the upper floor. The finds indicated that it was not in use in the Roman period, but it was confirmed that this and the other buildings round the forecourt are later than the sanctuary proper. Within the sanctuary, further excavation of the lateral store-chambers of the 'House of Hades' brought to light more pithoi, some of them containing corbonised wheat, beans and chick peas. From the floors were recovered Hellenistic vases, including a deep bowl with three moulded busts of Dionysus- Hades affixed near the bottom to serve as feet, also terracotta heads from figurines of Persephone. Miscellaneous finds included quantities of iron tools and implements and a piece of incense. Everywhere was evidence of destruction in an intense conflagration. The central room, the goal of those who consulted the oracle, was also further examined down to the heavy stone paving-slabs resting on a series of 14 transverse arches that span the basement below. On the paving slabs were remains of lead vessels and, beside the stone base of a staircase that rose in the north-east corner to the upper floor, a large cauldron of riveted sheets of bronze with vertical ring-handles supported by lions. At the foot of the staircase was a pile of iron, the remains of large spoked wheels, together with bronze castings including cog-wheels of various sizes, all of which appear to have belonged to a massive windlass. The excavator suggests that the function of this equipment was to lower from the upper floor, doubtless in the great bronze cauldron, appropriate 'ghosts' of those whom the living came to consult. If the preparatory diet of toxicants and narcotics and the incense-laden gloom failed to conjure in the imagination of the suppliant the likeness and counsel of the departed, it would seem that the manes ex machina could be brought into play. Kerkyra. A further campaign by G. Dontas in the park of the Royal villa 'Mon Repos' has not located</page><page sequence="18">20 A. H. S. MEGAW the site of the great Archaic temple (see AR 1962-63, 23), but has produced more of its remains from the slopes where they were thrown, evidently after its destruction by fire in the late fifth century. Apart from the roof terracottas from this building dating around 6o00 B.., on which the antefix heads are more than life-size, there are sima (5 types) and other fragments from smaller Archaic buildings. Votives are represented by bronzes (the earliest a tripod leg fragment), pottery (a Middle Protocorinthian leky- thos, Attic b.f. and r.f. fragments) and terracottas. Part of what may be an inventory of gifts was also found, incised boustrophedon on both sides of a lead sheet in Corinthian lettering of the first half of the fifth century (ADelt 19 Chr). Dontas has since re-excavated the temple foundation on the Analepsis hill first discovered in 1914 and dating from around 400 B.C. New fragments of the superstructure were found in- cluding parts of a marble sima with lion-heads (Kathimerini 17/1/65)- Supplementary soundings have been made by Dontas (A.S.) at the Roman bath discovered in the property of the Elaia Institute some years ago by V. Kallipolitis. It was established that Hellenistic houses had previously occupied the site and objects of yet earlier date were found, among them three lead sheets bearing inscriptions of the Late Archaic period: confirma- tions of debts drawn up before wit- nesses (Fig. 24). THESSALY Philia. Continuing his excavations on the looted sanctuary site, D. Theo- charis has found, among smaller frag- mentary inscriptions, part of a decree of the Koinon of the Thessalians which confirms the dedication of the sanc- tuary to Athena. The work has been limited in the main to the upper layers, where a Roman building with mosaic floors and scant remains of a Christian basilica are preserved, and to clearance of the disturbed material in looters' pits. No classical buildings have been located but they are at- tested by Early Hellenistic Doric drums of plastered poros, one of them over I m. in diameter. Among the numerous small finds bronzes pre- dominate: Late Geometric figurines, birds and fibulae of Blinkenberg's 'Helladic' type; and there are two Egyptian scarabs of the XXVth or XXVIth Dynasty. The Mycenaean sherds are LH IIIB of Thessalian fabric (ADelt 19 Chr). AMega Monasterion. The looting of a Mycenaean chamber tomb near this village, west of Stephano- vikeion on the Larisa-Volos road, led to the excava- tion of four more by Theocharis. In the looted tomb restorable remains of a rhyton and two other early IIIA vases were found. Contents of tomb B included 8 IIIB vases and a painted toy chariot drawn by a pair of giraffe-like horses (cover picture). Twelve somewhat earlier vases were found in the exceptionally rich tomb P with a great quantity of faience orna- ments, including beads in the shape of juglets and little plaques with sphinxes in relief; also some gold rosettes and other embossed ornaments, a gold signet ring (two priestesses ? between an altar and a shrine), a faience cylinder seal and 6 lentoid seals, one with an excellent horse. With Io IIIB vases in tomb A similar faience ornaments were found including some with the figure of a goddess or priestess wearing a FIG. 23</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 21 polos.

Lazarides (A.S.) has exposed more of the rooms surrounding the peristyle of what must have been one of the principal secular buildings of Phthiotic Thebes in the Byzantine period. Under the floor of one room remains of Hellenistic buildings differently orientated were uncovered. Also of Hellenistic date was the most interesting of the small finds: a faience head of negroid type. MACEDONIA Nea Nikomedeia. Conservation work has brought to light some additional features of the Early Neolithic settlement exposed in the excavations of 1963 sponsored by the British School. R. Rodden super- vised the cutting of a channel to drain the area exca- vated into the lower ground outside the limits of the mound, which exposed a section of the perimeter of the first settlement. Well beyond the outermost house of the first phase, a double ring of enclosure walls was found, of pise mud construction, each more than 50 cm. thick and separated by a corridor about 2 m. wide. Later, when the settlement grew, and reached the line of the double wall, a ditch was excavated outside it. Several burials, pertaining to the first occupation phase, were also found; and it is now apparent that in the Late Neolithic period a series of concentric trenches encircled the highest part of the mound. The unique frog figurines found in 1963 have been published by Rodden in Antiquity 38, 294 f. Naoussa. More of the large building of the Roman period at 'Baltaneto' has been uncovered by F. Petsas (A.S.), including the east side of the peristyle and the five rooms between it and the frontage on this side. The square central room and those to the south lack the mosaic floors of geometric design found elsewhere in the building. The peristyle had six unfluted marble columns on this side with capitals FIG. 24 combining acanthus and palm leaves above an egg- and-tongue moulding. On the incompletely exca- vated north side the intercolumniation was wider. Dion. Resuming excavations for the University of Salonika, G. Bakalakis in 1963 cleared a length of the south wall, including the south-western corner tower and the four next to it. It is 3 4om. wide and preserves on the average two courses above the euthynteria. The pottery associated with the latter and the style of the masonry place its construction in the second half of the fourth century rather than in the time of Archelaus, the founder of the city. S. Pelekanides began a re-examination of the large basilica excavated by Soteriades, and of the earlier one of which much remains beneath it (ADelt 19 Chr). Pella. During a seventh campaign, Ch. Makaronas resumed excavation of insula 2 (across the ancient street to the north of the House of the Lion Hunt), again finding terracottas and moulds in large quantities. In insula 4 (adjoining 2, to the west) he uncovered the greater part of a house on the street frontage with square piers round its peristyle. Among the finds from this house were three large terracotta statuettes of Athena with horns on the sides of her helmet, and a small bronze plaque with, in relief, a panther cub (or puppy?) devouring a smaller creature (Fig. 25). Work was started in 1963 in a new sector (VI) to the south-west, where a mechanical drain-digger had cut a pebble mosaic pavement. This was found to be the floor of a small circular room forming part of a large building of rather light construction arranged round a circular court 30 m. in diameter. The mosaic floor comprises a central circle filled with honeysuckle and palmette scrolls within an animal border from which only a griffin has survived com- plete (ADelt 19 Chr). In the 1964 campaign it was established that a colonnade ringed the central court and that the small circular room was one of four located outside it at the cardinal points. Erected around 300 B.c. this presumably public building overlies remains of others of the early fourth century (Kathimerini II /4/65). Salonika. Further excavations at the Roman odeum on the Law Courts site have revealed, behind the scene building, a double stoa with remains of a mosaic pavement. Miss Ph. Papadopoulou reports that this is earlier than the present odeum but may have fronted a predecessor also (ADelt 19 Chr). Excavations in Navarino Square, close to the Octagon discovered by Ch. Makaronas in 195o, have revealed large structures which may well have formed part of the Palace of Galerius, with whose Arch they appear to be axially related. A peristyle court, two broad corridors paved with mosaic and a large semi- circular exedra, opening from a wall 9 m. high at one point, are the principal features so far un- covered (ADelt I9 Chr). Further finds made during cleaning-up operations around St Sophia, including additional features of the earlier basilica identified to the east, are reported by Mrs. F. Drosoyianni (ADelt 18 Chr 235-242). Notable is a section of bronze-gilt revetment for an $49$</page><page sequence="20">22 A. H. S. MEGAW archivolt with a delicate vine-scroll in pierced work. The early fourteenth-century frescoes in the church of St Nicholas Orphanos, which have been cleaned with excellent results, are the subject of a recent monograph by A. Xyngopoulos illustrated with numerous colour plates.3 Amphipolis. Trial trenches excavated by D. Laza- rides (A.S.) in various parts of the site disclosed foundations mainly of the Roman period, though close to the west section of the city wall previously discovered the remains of a building of the fourth century B.C. were found near the surface. A fourth Christian basilica has been located. Trials were also made by Lazarides on 'Hill 133'. some 3 km. to the north, on the left bank of the Strymon, where E. Vanderpool and K. Pritchett of the American School had in 196o reported surface indications of occupation from the Neolithic to the Classical period. The trenches encountered no structural remains but yielded much pottery. The prehistoric wares recall those of Dikili-Tash (BCH 86, 916) and include both incised and painted fabrics, the latter usually with linear patterns in black on a red body, and one graphite-decorated sherd. Among the later pottery Geometric to Archaic predominates, notably two distinct wares with concentric circle decoration, one of them Thasian. E. Stikas (A.S.) has completed the excavation of Basilica F (AR 1962-63, 24). The well-preserved carpet-mosaic of the nave is arranged round a central square in which vases and vine scrolls fill the spandrels left by a large whorl. In the south aisle a large cable- pattern meander encloses rectangular panels with birds and animals, while the eastern section beyond the line of the screen comprises eight oval panels containing birds. Part of the socle of the screen is preserved including a central projection into the nave, where the entrance was flanked by rectangular pillars with acanthus capitals. Fragments were also found of an ambon of the type with niches between colonettes in the lower section. 200 m. south of the basilica two rooms of another building with mosaic floors were excavated, in one of which bold geometric designs surround an emblema depicting Europa and the bull. Kavala (anc. Neapolis). At a depth of 4 m. in a building site at 50 Theodore Poulidis Street, D. Lazarides recovered a further Archaic deposit from the nearby sanctuary of the Parthenos. Notable among the Attic pottery are substantial parts of two b.f. kraters, one with Labours of Herakles and another with a horseman and runners. There are many lekanides of Thasian and other fabrics, numerous 'subgeometric' concentric circle cups, Corinthian and East Greek sherds, and many votive terracotta figurines, prominent among them a Kore type grasping the chiton with one hand and holding a bird, animal or flower to the breast (Fig. 26). In the new Museum recently completed, the first room is assigned to finds from the sanctuary and other relics of Neapolis (ADelt 19 Chr). Philippi. In the neighbourhood of the Octagon Church S. Pelekanides (A.S.) has cleared more of the Egnatian Way, including part of an arcade west of the portico that leads to the church. Outside the apse of the Octagon and at a distance of 3 .90 m. a concentric wall has been found, forming a sort of ambulatory like that of the Miletus basilica. West of the narthex an outer passage 3"8o m. wide with an opus sectile floor has been cleared and beyond it an area (atrium?) preserving at a lower level a rough paving of earlier date. In this area, among much burnt material, were found parts of columns, capitals, bases, chancel posts and panels, doubtless from the earlier basilica. The Macedonian tomb reported last year is outside the north wall of the Octagon, in which had been incorporated remains of the south wall of a monu- ment that had surmounted the tomb. In the tomb chamber, constructed and vaulted in excellent ashlar masonry, the earth was much disturbed and con- tained Roman as well as earlier pottery and lamps. The gold objects were in an intact grave near the centre lined with marble slabs and with a cover inscribed EYHO'ENHE2 EZHKEEJTOY [ ]NOE in letters datable to the middle of the third century B.C. (ADelt 19 Chr). Abdera. In addition to further exploration of Hellenistic houses in the area of earlier trials in the west sector of the city, Miss K. Rhomiopoulou reports the discovery of fifth-century and fourth- century tombs on Kishlar Tepe to the north-west, burials and cremations mixed. One of the latter was in an Attic r.f. hydria with a domestic scene including a girl playing with balls of wool, attributable to the Peleus painter (ADelt 19 Chr). THE CYCLADES Kea. Resuming excavations at the Bronze Age settlement at Ayia Irini sponsored by the American School, J. Caskey further investigated the fortifica- tion wall across the promontory and identified work of two or more periods of construction (Fig. 27). In the north-east area, the primary north-south rampart was later protected by outworks, perhaps during the important development of the site in LM I. 3 Oi ZotZoypaQpleg zo dyiov NLKOAdov 'Opqaovoi OEoaaaovt'K (Athens, 1964). FIG. 25</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 23 Associated objects (not yet studied in detail) indicate that the whole initial system preceded the Mycenaean dominion, and is not later than MM III. Where the original wall turns south-east a broad entrance passage was found, leading to a small plateia behind the Temple. Within the Temple, despite the rise in sea-level since antiquity, it was possible by means of pumping and bailing to test strata below the floors. The walls were found to be bedded, in part at least, on bedrock, some o 8o to o90o m. below present sea-level; while several of the doorways have solid stone thresholds at levels well below the earth floors of the Late Bronze Age. In the initial stage, the 'adyton' was largely occupied by stone platforms, which were concealed by the floor on which the terracotta statue fragments were found in 1963. The pottery found with the sculpture was not later than LM IB; with the earlier platforms, grey Minyan and matt-painted wares were associated. Other indications of the importance of the town in the Middle Bronze Age include the discovery just outside the walls of several cist-graves and burial pithoi, all used for children and one of them con- taining fragments of a gold diadem, and beads of gold, cornelian and amethyst. The pottery from these burials includes a Keftiu cup of MM type and none of it is later than MM III. FIG. 26 Among evidence for literacy found in I964 are three inscribed items; a fragment of a tablet with one incised sign and traces of others; a terracotta lamp with three signs on its rim; and a small clay roundel with signs on either side. One of the signs on the lamp has no close parallel, but all the others are from the Linear A syllabary. From the plateia comes another inscribed piece, with characters of a form possibly related to Cypro-Minoan. A dozen or more bases of pots with simple marks of the sort known at Phylakopi and elsewhere have also been found. In the area west of the Temple, more basement rooms of the complex now known as House A were exposed and a number of deep soundings was made. These have shown that the area was thickly occupied in the Early and Middle Bronze Ages, though just when House A assumed its monumental character has not yet been determined. Architectural ele- ments exposed at one point go back to an early phase of LM/LH I, if not earlier, and indicate successive alterations of the building. The important pottery group from Room I (Hesperia XXXIII, 324), com- prising more than 30 vases, has now been studied. Of the many pieces imported from Crete and the mainland none is later than LM IB or LH II. It seems unlikely that IIIA pottery reached Kea before the earthquake which destroyed the major parts of House A, since none of it was found there. The excavator suggests that the basements of Houses F and C were partly cleared and re-used after the earthquake, for among the pottery from House F, more of which was cleared in 1964, and from House C are a kylix and some pieces decorated with spiral ornaments that belong clearly to the IIIA repertory. A fragment of white marble slab from a modern stone wall bears an incised profile representation of the head of a warrior, wearing a helmet in three tiers, with curving cheekpiece and waving plume (Archaeology 17, no.4, 279)- Caskey regards him as a Mycenaean Greek, and assigns the stele to the period of Mycenaean ascendancy attested by the importation of LH IIIA pottery. Delos. The exploration of the Skardhana quarter by the French School was resumed with excavations in the area between the Establishment of the Posei- doniasts and the House of the Comedians. Here, backing onto the House of the Diadumenos, was found a series of two rooms with a cistern-court to the south and, further to the west, a second cistern-court. The latter is furnished on two sides with Ionic porticoes of a type not previously found in Delos, in which the columns stand on pedestals linked by stone balustrades. Three of the four capitals are preserved. Graffiti on the walls of the court and the rooms to the south suggest that the house had been occupied by soldiers. Fragments of an upper-floor mosaic of good workmanship representing Lycurgus and Ambrosia were also recovered. The main oikos lies to the north of the court and here, in a hole cut in the floor in the south-east corner, a hoard of coins and jewellery was found: 5 gold staters and demi-staters of Rhodes, 59 Attic tetradrachms of the new style,</page><page sequence="22">24 A. H. S. MEGAW 3 necklaces, 2 bracelets, 4 earrings, 3 repousse6 medallions and a finger-ring. The study of the 'Monument of the Bulls', the most prominent feature of the eastern part of the Sanctuary of Apollo, had been resumed in 1963 (BCH 88, 901 ff.). Further soundings at various points were made in 1964, notably in the long central section (supposedly the neorion that housed the trireme dedicated by Demetrius Poliorcetes) and in the pro- naos at the south end. The foundations were examined and dating material collected. Paros. Further remains of the demolished atrium of the Katapoliani church have been discovered by A. Orlandos (A.S.), including the west entrance, preceded by a porch with lateral niches, matching the south entrance previously found. The square forecourt was paved with marble and, to judge by ......-. .. D _ FIG. 27 scattered fragments of a marble basin, had a central phiale. During restoration of the baptistery, the later wall separating the eastern section with the font from the central area under the dome was removed, revealing that a screen of two columns carrying an epistyle had originally occupied this position. Only the lateral bays of this screen had doors. Saliagos. On this small islet between Paros and Antiparos, the British School in the summer of 1964 sponsored an initial excavation campaign, directed by J. Evans and C. Renfrew, with the kind con- currence of N. Zapheiropoulos, who first discovered traces of a prehistoric settlement there. Renfrew had subsequently observed surface material indicating its Neolithic character, now fully confirmed by the excavation. This waterless islet seemed such a surprising location for any settlement site that suspicions of a change in sea-level were aroused. A party of aqua- lung divers was therefore attached to the excavation, and their explorations produced satisfactory evidence that in antiquity Saliagos had formed part of an isthmus linking Antiparos with Paros, and that in this area the sea-level had risen at least 3 m. since Roman times. Among other indications was a complicated system of rock-cut trenches, visible now below water level. That these continue on land and were in fact cut on land was demonstrated by a small supplementary excavation on Antiparos. Confirmation was provided by the identifi- cation of submerged remains, including a well-head of classical date and several Early Cycladic cist-graves. On Saliagos itself, a line of trenches was cut along its length revealing a soil depth sometimes of only 30 cm. At the south end, however, there was a good depth of stratified deposits, and here in an area measuring some 20 by 10 m. extensive stone debris of destroyed houses was found (Fig. 28). Further study of the architectural remains is planned for a second campaign in 1965, but it is already clear that the houses were rectangular structures, including some small units no more than 3 m. long. Between this south area and the foreshore, a well-stratified deposit to a depth of 2 - 50 m. was found. Traces of an earlier building phase were observed here, but they were scanty in the small area studied. The lowest levels in this region contained traces of burning and considerable quantities of well- preserved pottery. At the north end of the island, walls were again found and here too, below them, traces of earlier occupation, with numerous finds of pottery and obsidian. Pottery was indeed abundant in all levels of the site, and showed considerable uni- formity. The fine wares were in general dark-faced and burnished; the commonest form, a flat-based, rather straight-sided open bowl (Fig. 29). These bowls were sometimes set on a very tall pedestal base of fruit-stand type (Fig. 30). Decoration in matt white paint was common, usually rectilinear in style. There was no pattern burnish, and only a few sherds are decorated with incisions. These, like the handful of fragments with dark-on-light painted motifs, are probably imports. The obsidian industry, for which the raw material was imported from Melos, was exceptionally rich: over I,ooo pieces were catalogued and drawn. The most notable type was the bifacially flaked arrowhead with prominent tang, though some fifteen other types</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 25 centuries B.C., some of which utilised figured Attic vases, burials of the Hellenistic period, with jewellery and other gifts, and cremations of the early Imperial period, which yielded some fine glass vessels. From the fill around the tombs comes an inscribed lead tablet of the late fourth century B.c. In the Sanctuary, J. McCredie virtually com- pleted excavation of the Hellenistic Stoa and its periphery (Fig. 31). In all 1451 fallen blocks of its superstructure have been collected. Deep ex- cavation within the north end of the building re- vealed 17 foundation FIG. 28 of artefact were classified. Stone axes of haematite- limonite were common,as were bone awls and points. The small finds include several worked shell spoons, a fragment of a bracelet made of spondylus and an anthropomorphic amulet of bone. There are as yet few parallels for cross-dating; it seems that the settlement, the first of Neolithic date to be excavated in the Cyclades, was roughly con- temporary with the Late Neolithic mainland of Greece and the islands of the eastern Aegean. Similar surface finds have recently been studied from the site of Mavrispilia in Mykonos (AJA 68, 395-400). There is no doubt that these and the Saliagos material are earlier than the 'Protocycladic' graves found in Antiparos by Bent and Tsountas. A date around the turn of the fifth to fourth millennium is suggested by the excavators, and it is hoped to confirm this by radio-carbon determinations. Naxos. As part of a systematic listing of important icons in the Cyclades launched by N. Drandakis (some 2,000 were listed in I963), Miss C. Stravrinou has examined those surviving in Naxos. This has drawn attention to a Crucifixion of exceptional quality, dating probably from the fourteenth century and preserved in the church of the Panayia Theoske- pastos in the Chora. OTHER AEGEAN ISLANDS Samothrace. With support from New York Uni- versity, the American School excavations under the leadership of Phyllis Lehmann, were resumed both in the South Necropolis and in the Sanctuary. In the former, Mrs E. Dusenbery and A. Vavritsas concentrated on a small area where fragments of marble tomb monuments had previously been found. Here, a fragment of the ancient terrace wall of the cemetery was found, as well as a number of tombs. These included cremations of the sixth and fifth FIG. 29 FIG. 30</page><page sequence="24">26 A. H. S. MEGAW courses, contrasting with the single course of the south foundation. The Western Hill was evidently considerably extended to accommodate the long stoa. The fill used in this process contained quantities of sherds as late as the first half of the third century B.C., and yielded many vessels of the sort used in the rites of the Sanctuary, one of them stamped 0e65v. Behind the Propylon of Ptolemy II, McCredie discovered the side walls of a terrace forming the abutment of a bridge across the adjoining gully, by which the Sanctuary was reached. Part of the other abutment was also found and incorporated in it two sections of a round building, possibly a predecessor of the Rotunda'of Arsinoe. The vaulted culvert passing through the foundation of the Propylon was cleared. Thasos. The excavation of the remains of the sanctuary of the Oeoi tnrarp3ot on Evraiocastro point has been completed by the French School. The massive retaining wall on the north slope was found to have been built at the end of the sixth century B.C., and raised in the late fifth. In the south-east angle of the sanctuary the remains of a stoa were found with a bench along the back and end walls, con- structed in the Early Hellenistic period, to judge by figurine fragments found below the floor. This became a cemetery area in the Early Christian period; 32 graves were found, contemporary with the basilica, the remains of which occupy the central part of the site. A trial excavation in the Tokatlis property, between the Plateia and the Herakleion, made at the request of the Archaeological Service, revealed what appears to be the marble-paved atrium and a section of the annexes of another basilica, in use until around A.D. 600. Numerous early Christian marble mullions, chancel posts and panels were found. At a lower level mosaic floors of a Roman villa were preserved, which by their style are datable to the late second or early third centuries A.D. In one case the square centrepiece represents a pair of erotes in combat and is flanked by two smaller panels containing birds. In the Agora, a sounding was made at the north end of the south-west stoa to clarify the construction and chronology of the adjoining section of the town wall. C. Rolley has published the new Statue of Nemesis and the other sculptures from the 1962-63 excavations in the Agora, in BCH 88, 496 ff. Lemnos. A full account of the Italian School excavations in the prehistoric settlement at Poliochni has been published: L. Bernabb Brea, Poliochni (Rome, 1964). Samos. In the German Institute's latest campaign at the Heraion, H. Walter first re-examined the early remains adjoining the 'Rhoikos altar' on the north. Their reconstruction as a propylon, formerly pro- posed, must be rejected. The routes to the altar lay elsewhere; their limits have now been defined by the discovery of bases for the dedications which lined them. In the area south of the altar, particularly by the ship-base, some notable imported items were found, including fragments of a Protocorinthian jug with procession and animal friezes, and two Cypriot terracotta heads. Near the northern limit of the Sanctuary, E. Homann-Wedeking examined the area where Buschor had expected to find a North Gate, on the prolon- gation of the north-south street he discovered. Here were found a small open space, the base of a statue of a pankratiast and foundations datable to the time FIG. 31</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 27 of Rhoikos and possibly connected with the gate- buildings. Notable among individual finds was the torso of a marble kouros one-and-a-half times life size, which joins two fragments previously found. Kythera. The soundings at 'Kastri', which con- firmed that this was the site of a Minoan colony (AR 1963-64, 25), were followed in the summer of 1964 by the systematic excavation of an area acquired on the west slope of the promontory. The work was again directed by G. L. Huxley, sponsored by the British School and supported by the Pennsylvania University Museum. R. Hope Simpson and J. Lazenby supervised this main excavation, where substantial remains of houses of the Minoan colony have now been revealed (Fig. 32). To judge by the associated pottery these date in the main from the LM IB phase and appear to have been abandoned without any destruction by fire, in the second half of the fifteenth century B.c. In the lowest strata many fragments of MM pottery were found, much of it imported from Crete, including some of the distinctive Barbotine wares. Some of the sherds were of MM I type, confirming that Kastri was one of the earliest Minoan overseas settlements yet discovered. In addition to imported Cretan wares, locally manufactured pottery was also found, the earliest imitating the MM fabrics. Con- temporary mainland pottery was also present, but in very small quantities. A MH cup of red clay with a rudimentary decoration of porpoises was found in a LM IA context. In the last phase of the settlement, wares of Minoan type again predominated, both locally made and imported. The latter included a number of frag- ments with figure-of-eight shields, some of them represented with their hanging-straps. But at this final stage, in the mid-fifteenth century B.C., Mycenaean pottery from the mainland is increasingly in evidence. Characteristic is a series of LH IIA fragments with representations of double axes (Fig. 33). Immediately above the LM IB house remains, and in places cut into them, Early Byzantine walling was found. No remains of intermediate occupation have survived in the area excavated, though Skandeia, the port of Kythera in Classical times, was certainly located here. Close to the surface was found a black-glaze sherd with the graffito AIH2QN IAOM[ Surface finds from the neighbourhood included a limestone block with the single word MAAOX in Archaic characters. Byzantine coins from the surface layers of the excavated area suggest that the late fortification which gives Kastri its name may date from the sixth century A.D. At a point about I50 m. inland, known as "Kas- traki", beneath a substantial building of Roman date, a circular pit was excavated, which produced the first evidence of occupation before the foundation of the Minoan colony. Apart from EH pottery, the pit yielded some fragments of Neolithic date, in- cluding a few with incised chevron and zigzag patterns filled with a white paste. FIG. 32 On the Asprogas ridge, A. Trik completed the excavation of the large tomb E. The two remaining chambers yielded plentiful MM IIIB to LM IA pottery broken by intruders, but including one complete cup with purple decoration. One of the tombs (J) on the road to Mitata village damaged during road works in 1958 was excavated by N. Coldstream. LM IA and B and LH II pottery was recovered from its three chambers, all of which had been re-used in LH IIIB times, as several kylix stems of the thirteenth century B.C. type attest. K. Minto prepared a contour survey of the area, including the classical fortifications on Palaiokastro mountain identifiable with the ancient Kythera. He also drew the limestone capitals and other members of an Archaic Doric building in the church of Hagios Kosmas, which are commonly connected with the sanctuary of Aphrodite.

The dromos of the tomb at Katsambas, which in 1963 produced the fine ivory pyxis, has been cleared by S. Alexiou (A.S.). It was found to be 9' 3 m. long but under a metre wide at the entrance, at which end it had the form of a vaulted passage cut in the rock. Knossos. S. Hood returned for a further period to study the material from his stratigraphical excava- tions for the British School, particularly the MM deposit from the south of the Royal Road. The whole of the fragmentary pottery from Evans's excavations has now been transferred from the Palace to the new premises constructed for the Strati- graphical Museum by the Villa Ariadne, and the greater part of it has been transferred to new boxes and set in final order (Fig. 34). Restoration of</page><page sequence="26">28 A. H. S. MEGAW FIG. 33 vases from fragments in the collection has continued; notable is a MM IA jug without context (Fig. 35)- Thirty-five complete vases from Evans's excava- tions attributable to the last days of the Palace have been identified by M. Popham and published as Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology V (Lund, 1964). The vases, most of which have not been illustrated before, are assigned to advanced LM IIIB, like the latest pottery from House E at Mallia, with only one cup to represent the beginning of the IIIC style. A date within the second half of the thirteenth century is suggested for the final abandonment of the Palace site by its reoccupiers. Amnisos. Excavations by S. Alexiou on the site selected by the Tourist Organisation for a Motel and plage established that Minoan Amnisos extended west of Palaiochora hill, and that the Mycenaean city lay even farther west, towards the river. Neither the LM I building, nor the LM IIIB complex farther west produced spectacular finds (ADelt 19 Chr). Tylissos. A deposit at 'Korphi tou Pyrgou' con- nected with a MM I rock sanctuary, excavated by Alexiou, yielded numerous votive figurines both male and female and many fragments of coarse vases. Smaller quantities were found at 'Pera Korphi' where there is a rectangular structure, probably Minoan in origin but re-used in the Hellenic period (ADelt 19 Chr) . Arkalochori. The excavation of two LM III tombs by K. Davaras is reported. The first, at Tsoulouka Kolymbos, contained two larnakes, one of them held the bones of at least four persons, and nine vases, mostly stirrup-jars and cups. The other, at Xylan- gouri, contained in addition to three larnakes, of which two had octopus decoration, a stirrup-jar, an amphora, a high-footed kylix and a cup (ADelt 18 Chr, 312). Arkhanes. Part of a finely-constructed building, said to belong to the mid-fifteenth century B.c., has been excavated within the village by I. Sakellarakis (A.S.). The entrance with two supporting columns has been uncovered, and in the neighbourhood were found four portable stone altars set close together to form a larged sacred table. Floral frescoes are also reported from the building, most of which underlies the present village. Vathy (Herakleion). Between Ayios loannis and Vathy, an accidentally discovered chamber tomb with dromos has been excavated. It contained a decorated larnax and lid, a one-handled footed cup of LM IIIB type and three skeletons. Phaistos. The latest excavations of the Italian School, directed by D. Levi, have thrown further light on the ramp discovered in 1963, leading from the lower to the upper west court and connected with the earlier phase of the palace. Its western section, where the hill slopes steeply and the Proto- geometric N-S ramp passes over it, is carried on a large buttressed platform, beneath which structures were observed earlier than the second proto-palatial period, to which the ramp belongs. Demolition of the remains of a hut constructed on this section of the ramp produced sherds of the late palatial period, when it is clear the ramp was no longer in use. Farther west, where the ramp turns NE to join the paving of the upper court, remains of an earlier ramp were found belonging to the first proto-palatial phase dated by the abundant pottery from a row of rooms adjoining it. At one point, where the two ramps are superimposed, the intermediate layer yielded sherds exclusively of the first period, most of them of the Hagia Photini class but including two little tea-pots like those of Patrikies, one of them with Barbotine decoration. Near the junction of the later ramp with the upper court, a wall forming the western limit of this theatral area was found. This wall was in part reconstructed and the court itself repaved when the ramp was abandoned. A summary of the results of his excavations since 1950 and the bearing they have on various debated issues have been published by Levi as vol. XI of Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology (Lund, 1964). He proposes inter alia the abbreviation of the Early Minoan period into a short transitional "prepalatial" phase between the Chalcolithic (vice Neolithic) and the beginning of palatial civilisation, c. I85o B.C. FIG. 34</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 29 FIG. 35 Mallia. The French School excavations in the area to the west of House E were resumed. Several LM IIIB vases from the upper level date the end of occupation in this region. On the preceding floor, formed on a LM IA fill, clear traces of fire were found. Nearby, part of an early MM house was uncovered and in one of its rooms a red plaster floor divided by white bands into panels simu- lating paving (Fig. 36). In and around the palace, soundings established the exist- ence of a pre-palatial level, which probably extended over the greater part of the slightly higher ground where the palace was later built. Some plaster floors belonging to the first palace were also exposed. Kato Zakro. Excavation of the Minoan palace, which in 1963 had produced such notable trea- sures -(ILN 29/2 and 7/3/64) were resumed by N. Platon (A.S.). The west wing, of truly palatial character, is now entirely un- covered, together with the greater part of the central court (12 by 30 m.) and the facades of the other three wings around it (Fig. 37). Tests below the floors of two rooms (XI and XVII) revealed traces of earlier buildings of MM II and MM III date, and below another room (XXXII) remains of EM III to MM IA character were found. No sign of any occupation later than the end of LM IB came to light. Great pieces of volcanic ash, mixed with sulphur, were found within the palace, which lend colour to Professor Marinatos's theory of destruction caused by the eruption of Thera about 1450 B.C. In the west wing, the room with the light-well (XXVIII) has been revealed as a large 'Royal Megaron' subdivided by colonnades, with a 'Room of the Symposia' (XXIX) opening off it and con- taining numerous amphorae and jugs. In both, plaster ribs divide the floor into rectangular units which were filled with a composition so far un- identified. In the Megaron were found a number of bronze tools, including the largest saws of Minoan date yet found, suggesting that repairs were in progress when the palace perished. All round the 'Room of the Symposia' lay remains of a painted plaster frieze with spirals in relief, which had evidently fallen from close to the ceiling. The large tripartite room of the north wing (XXXII) was probably the kitchen, to judge by a hearth found in one corner with a large cooking-pot in position. In the opposite corner of the court (XLI), steps lead down to a built well, which contained many conical cups, one of them filled with olives in a fine state of preservation. In the adjoining Room XLII stood numerous pots and a bronze tripod cauldron. In addition, excavations were started at a Minoan villa on the road from Pano to Kato Zakro, where a great quantity of fresco fragments with plant and other decoration was recovered.
