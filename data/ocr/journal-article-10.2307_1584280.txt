<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vigiliae Christianae 42 (1988), 318-326, E. J. Brill, Leiden THE THEOGONY OF THEOPHILUS BY CARL CURRY From a strictly etymological perspective "theogony" would concern itself only with the genesis of the gods while "cosmogony" would cover the creation of the world. Hesiod's Theogony contains accounts of the origins of immortals, mortals, and the world, including the "events which led to the establishment of the present order".' When the second century Christian apologist Theophilus of Antioch wrote to his pagan friend Autolycus, he analyzed pagan accounts of theogonic materials and offered a Christian alternative. His purpose was to enlighten Autolycus concerning the one, true God, creation, and the history of man. Theophilus intended to demonstrate that the Christian account was the true one. He was aware that Autolycus had read "the histories and genealogies of the so-called gods" (2.2) and was concerned because Autolycus did not realize that he was reading about the generations of men and not gods. Theophilus makes frequent references to the gods and their deeds relying most heavily upon Hesiod for his information. Grant suggests that Hesiod's Theogony would have been a part of his school cur- riculum.2 Zeegers-Vander Vorst is convinced that when Theophilus wrote Ad Autolycum he had "sous les yeux le texte complet ou tout au moins de tres longs fragments de la Theogonie."3 Theophilus does not refrain from acknowledging his dependence upon Hesiod. Lengthy quotations from him are to be found in 2.5-6.4 Hesiod is not the only source of information concerning pagan theogonies. Theophilus draws upon Homer, Plato, Euripides, Orpheus, and others. He is delighted to convict them of numerous errors. The Sibyl is the one non-biblical author whom he does not consider it necessary to correct. Theophilus is not responding solely to Hesiod but to pagan doctrines of the gods and creation in general of which Hesiod is a major source. He is furnishing the truth about the gods and man.</page><page sequence="2">THE THEOGONY OF THEOPHILUS In order to understand both him and his writing it is very helpful to read the works he read and used, especially Hesiod and Homer. To suggest that Theophilus is writing a "theogony" is not in any way to argue that he is trying to compete with Hesiod with respect to style. Here, he is greatly outclassed. His predilection for supplying a Christian counterpart to pagan theogonies is evinced by his subject matter, overall structure, and by his dependence upon pagan, theogonic terminology for explaining the relationship between the Logos and God. The structure and content of Theophilus' apology demonstrates that he has pagan theogonies in mind as he relates the origin and nature of God, then the origin of mankind, and finally the establishment of the present order. Book I is a response to Autolycus' request for Theophilus to show him his God (1.2,14). First, Autolycus must prove that he can see God because the nature of the true God is quite different from his gods of wood and stone (1.1,9). Theophilus proceeds to describe God and concludes Book I by claiming to have accomplished his assigned task. In this discussion he contrasts the Christian God and the pagan gods. The Christian God is clearly superior to the gods found in Hesiod's Theogony (1.9). Theophilus claims that he learned these things from the holy prophets, who wrote of things past, present, and future through the guidance of the Spirit of God (1.14). Similarly, Hesiod asserts that the muses provided the inspiration for him to write (Theogony 36-38).5 Book II opens with a reference to the subject of the first book. Since he has already dealt with his God, he now goes on to give an account of creation and the history of man. Both are theogonic motifs. Before he goes into this, he discredits the pagan writings (2.2-8) and then describes creation by the Logos with a lengthy quotation from Genesis followed by a rather straightforward exegesis (2.9-19). He does not miss out on an opportunity to charge Hesiod with being "entirely alien to the truth" (2.12-13). His report on the history of man begins with a quota- tion from Genesis on the events of Eden followed once again by his exegesis (2.20-32). Book III begins with a reference to the very topics discussed by Hesiod and others. Theophilus cannot understand why Autolycus still abides by them and refuses the teaching of the Christians. He feels that it is necessary to establish the antiquity of the sacred scriptures in order for Autolycus to accept them. Once again, he begins by throwing jabs at Greek literature (3.2-8). Like other Christian apologists of the time, 319</page><page sequence="3">CARL CURRY he deems it necessary to defend Christians against accusations of immorality (3.9-15). The section on chronology begins with a discussion of the deluge, as he vindicates the biblical story and denounces heathen accounts (3.16-19). While his main purpose in this section is to prove that his religion is not new, the detailed sketch of human history is con- terminous with the theogonic motif. Before he is finished, he has proven that his sources are older and more reliable than the Greek's (3.26). Now, Theophilus has answered Hesiod's Theogony and established the truthfulness, veractiy, and antiquity of his Christian theogony. Theophilus betrays a further dependence upon theogonic language when he deals with the relationship between the Logos and God and with the nature of the Logos. His Christology or lack of it has been cause for great concern.6 He shows no interest in the normal Christian dogmas of birth, death, and resurrection. He does not mention the incarnation. Instead, he theorizes in grossly anthropomorphic ter- minology. Why does he say that the Logos was vomited forth (2.10)? Why does he position the Logos in the inward parts (splanchna) of God (2.10)? Did all of this familiarity with pagan theogonies influence his understanding and description of the Logos? A summary of his theology about the Logos will be helpful at this juncture. Theophilus claims that the Logos was present at the creation of the world and that God created all things through him (2.10). The Hebrew prophets spake through the Logos (2.10). When scripture teaches that God was in a certain place, Theophilus interprets this as a reference to the Logos. "Since the Logos is God and derived his nature from God, whenever the Father of the universe wills to do so he sends him into some place where he is present and is heard and seen. He is sent by God and is present in a place." (2.22) This interpretation is necessitated by the fact that God is unconfined and not found in any place. These statements tell something about the function of the Logos. To say that the Logos was present in a certain place might cause one to question how the Logos could be found somewhere and be always "innate in the heart of God" (2.10,22). Theophilus does not satisfac- torily answer this question. He assures Autolycus that God does not deprive himself of the Logos. He employs endiathetos and prophorikos as technical terms to try to explain this difficulty. The first refers to the Logos when he is within God, and the second refers to the Logos when he has been expressed by God (2.10,22). Grant has correctly identified the source of this explanation. "Theophilus, in formulating his Logos 320</page><page sequence="4">THE THEOGONY OF THEOPHILUS doctrine, is primarily interpreting the words of scripture, though in terms derived from Stoic-Philonic psychology."' In another place Grant discusses the mixed feelings of early Christians regarding the use of such terminology, but still these terms were used by other Christians.8 Is it possible for the Logos endiathetos and the Logos prophorikos to exist in different places simultaneously? For Theophilus it is, as he envi- sions a continual line of communication existing between God and his Logos (2.22). This discussion is not directly pertinent to the notion of theogony, but will later be connected indirectly. The place of the Logos and the terms of his coming into being reveal Theophilus' determination to create a theogony. He describes the divine generating process as vomiting forth or disgorging (2.10), just as Hesiod had related how Kronos was tricked into vomiting up the stone which he had swallowed thinking that it was Zeus (Theogony, 497). The words that were used by the two authors are different, but the action is the same. Of course, for Hesiod such a disgorging action could not have occurred unless the swallowing had first taken place. Kronos had swallowed all of his offspring before he had swallowed the stone (459,487-8). Zeus followed the example of his father with a slight change when he placed Metis in his belly so that she could not bear his offspring (889-900). Theophilus mentions this swallowing of Metis by Zeus (3.3). He does not venture to say that the Logos was swallowed or placed inside of God as his means of entrance. As the Logos endiathetos he always enjoyed being with the Father, but to write that the Logos was generated by being vomited or disgorged betrays a Hesiodic influence. Clearly, scripture does not confine the relationship between God and the Logos with this terminology.9 This is an added and unnecessary detail which seems to be forced into service. The use of prophorikos to describe the expressed Logos is much more appropriate for God and excludes such a blatant anthropomorphism. The location of the Logos within God proves to be just as definitive as his method of exiting from god. Why does Theophilus position the Logos within the inward parts (splanchna) of God (2.10)? The inward parts include the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys, and they were especially important in animal sacrifices. In 2.22 Theophilus chooses not to repeat this term but says instead that the Logos was within the heart (kardia) of God. Splanchnon is found in scripture. In the NT it is used almost exclusively in its metaphorical sense meaning feelings of mercy or com- 321</page><page sequence="5">CARL CURRY passion.10 The LXX uses it both metaphorically and literally." The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs uses splanchnon in a very interesting way when it is personified as God's agent or perhaps as a part of himself. God is going to send his splanchnon upon the earth (T Zeb 8.2, T Naph 4.5). It is not clear whether this is a Messianic prophecy or not. This may be another metaphorical use of the term referring to God showing his mercy to mankind. Still, in none of these instances is there the slightest reference to the Logos (or Messiah) being in the inward parts of God. Theophilus' choice of inward parts is more puzzling because the NT gave him the word to use if he wanted to identify the location of the Logos within the Father. John places the Logos in the bosom (kolpos) of the Father (Jo 1.18). Theophilus quotes from the first chapter of John and thus shows that he was familiar with it (2.22). Eusebius, Basil, and other early Christian writers use bosom and discuss the usage of it.12 Since Theophilus certainly knew kolpos was used in scripture, why did he not choose to use it? Splanchnon is not the word commonly used in the Theogony either. When Kronos placed the stone in himself, he is said to have placed it in his stomach (nedus) (889-900). However, there is a Stoic-Hesiodic fragment which has Metis in the inward parts of Zeus (fr. 343).3 It is contained in a discussion of Chrysippus which survives through Galen. 4 Chrysippus is discussing two versions of the birth of Athene. Chrysippus attributes both versions to Hesiod. West thinks that the fragment was probably not part of the Theogony but was in another poem which was perhaps appended to it.15 This fragment contains several intriguing similarities with Theophilus, and there is reason to believe he had read it in some form. He knows both Hesiod and Chrysippus and could have gotten the account from either. Perhaps, the text of the Theogony that Theophilus had access to contained the account which occurs in this fragment; or, if he only possessed fragments, he had a fragment with this report. The statement contained in the fragment relevant to this paper is that after the birth of Athene Metis remained under (hupo) the inward parts (splanchna) of Zeus. This means that Metis resided in Zeus in the very locale where the Logos was to be found in God, and it is interesting to note that the name Metis has some meanings which are almost as abstract as Logos and that she performs some of the same functions as the Logos. 322</page><page sequence="6">THE THEOGONY OF THEOPHILUS The faculty of advising, wisdom, counsel, cunning and craft demon- strate a useful spectrum of meanings.'6 In the Theogony Hesiod states that one of the benefits of having Metis within him is that she will be a constant counselor (sumboulos, 899). Theophilus refers to the Logos as the sumboulos of God (2.22). Metis is referred to as the wisest of gods and men (888). The Stoic fragment has the same epithet. Chrysippus' description of Athene is even more striking. He ascribes to her the quality of being metis almost as if she were her mother. It is not unusual to think of the offspring as the parent; however, after Athene is born from Zeus' head, it is almost as if there is a Metis within Zeus and one outside of Zeus. This causes the reader of Theophilus to think of the way he distinguishes between the Logos endiathetos and the Logos pro- phorikos. This comparison is not meant to suggest that Theophilus is dependent upon this fragment for his terminological distinctions because that is certainly not the case; however, in light of the parallels between the Stoic-Hesiodic fragment and Ad Autolycum, one is not able to abstain from wondering what was going on in Theophilus' mind. Does he intend to offer the Logos' relationship with God as a parallel to that among Zeus, Metis and Athene? The fact that the Hesiodic fragment has Metis in Zeus' inward parts, which is not the word used normally in the Theogony, and that Theophilus has the Logos within the same place in God, which is not the expected Christian term, is the most influential evidence for arguing that Theophilus was familiar with it. However, there is another parallel that is also significant. Mention has been made of Zeus swallowing Metis and Theophilus' reference to it, but the Theogony does not say that Zeus swallowed Metis. It states that Zeus placed her in his stomach (889-900). Hesiod also describes Kronos putting the stone in his stomach in this way (459). Why does Theophilus say that Zeus swallowed her? The fragment which we have been referring to says that Zeus swallowed her down, which is the same term that Theophilus uses (katapino). This is found in Chrysippus' explanation and not in the birth narrative, which may be an indication that Theophilus had access to this portion of Chrysippus. It is only fair to acknowledge that Hesiod does use this word when describing how Kronos swallowed down his offspring (459, 467), but now there are two key words which both Theophilus and the fragment contain which are not found in the Theogony in the same way. There are also points of similarity between Athene who was generated from the head of Zeus and the Logos who was disgorged by God. In 323</page><page sequence="7">CARL CURRY the Stoic-Hesiod fragment, Chrysippus calls Athene the sumboulos of Zeus (just like her mother), and he refers to her with the term phronesis. Theophilus says that the Logos is the sumboulos and the phronesis of God (2.22). This usage of these terms is not paralleled in scripture. Since these two terms occur in Chrysippus' discussion of the birth narrative rather than in the narrative itself, it is another reason to argue that Theophilus knew this fragment of Chrysippus and derived his informa- tion from it. Admittedly, this presupposes that Theophilus' teaching about the Logos has been influenced in the way that is being argued, but by now this seems certain. It is possible to argue that Theophilus was representing the Logos as God's counterpart to Athene. Why did Theophilus depart from Christian terminology and adopt that used in pagan literature which he avowedly disdains? It must be remembered that he is addressing a pagan friend who is thoroughly entrapped by pagan religion. Theophilus himself had been in the same position before he read the scriptures and was converted. It is under- standable that a pagan convert would do that very thing when com- municating with such a friend. He is explaning things in terms that he is familiar with and terms that he knows Autolycus will recognize. He had read Homer and Hesiod and was familiar with numerous other pagan authors through anthologies. He also was acquainted with Chrysippus (2.4,3.8). Theophilus is recording the same knowledge that is given by pagan authors, but he is trying to Christianize it. He has a Christian God, a Christian creation story, and a Christian Logos. It is not practical to think that a convert could simply leave all previous learning behind without being influenced by it. This is especially true in a time when proper terminology had not been fixed. The second century witnessed borrowing by Christians from pagans. The apologists of that time had taken over certain Greek philosophical ideas about the Logos. Theophilus, however, went farther than the others when he applied blatant anthropomorphisms to God and the Logos. While he was read and used by Christians of later times, they never repeated these references; but remember that he lived before the great Christological debates occurred. Christology was not a major concern of the second century. Theophilus was trying to offer an explanation of the relationship between the Logos and God that could be understood by Autolycus. This is not easily accomplished. What is the connection between the two? Is the Logos identical with God? Was the Logos derived from God at some point in time? Is the Logos inside 324</page><page sequence="8">THE THEOGONY OF THEOPHILUS of God, and if so how can he be found outside of Him? Are they two separate beings, and, if they are, how can they appear at times to be identical? Theophilus used the information at his disposal, which included pagan writings, in an attempt to answer these questions. His conclusions were unacceptable, but has anyone since satisfied everyone concerning these questions? What does all of this say about Christianity at Antioch in the second half of the second century? Where is the strict adherence to the Chris- tian dogmas that can be found in Ignatius, who was the bishop of Antioch early in the second century? Theophilus is not at all concerned about ecclesiastical authority, which was a major concern of Ignatius. It must be acknowledged that many of the differences can be disposed of by simply recognizing that the two men were writing for two totally different purposes and to two very distinct audiences (at least at face value), but there is also present some kind of development at work. By the middle of the second century, men had been attracted to Christianity who had had at least a brief introduction to a "classical" education. This is manifest in the writings of the apologists of the period, especially in regards to their teaching about the Logos of God. Their apologetics occur on a much more philosophical plain than was previously apparent. Some of these men attained positions of authority within the church. It is not surprising that where this happened the church might take on a different appearance for a little while. It is evident that this is the situation at Antioch while the church was under the leadership of Theophilus. NOTES * I acknowledge my appreciation to Professor Robert M.
