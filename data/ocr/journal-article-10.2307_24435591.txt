<plain_text><page sequence="1">METAPHILOSOPHY Vol. 12, Nos. 3 &amp; 4, July/October 1981 THE PHILOSOPHICAL ROOTS OF THE CURRENT MEDICAL CRISIS Joan M. Boyle and James E. Morriss Philosophy by its very nature, is an interdisciplinary enterprise in that one of its primary tasks is to evaluate the conceptual systems of various disciplines. As a rational critic the philosopher must question root metaphors and raise to consciousness any hidden assumptions that may reveal incongruities or flaws in the models which structure thought, expectations and behavior. Today prominent figures in the medical profession are calling attention to a "crisis" that exists in the health care industry. It is a crisis that appears to be raising serious philosophical questions regarding the model of medicine itself. The aim of this paper is to examine the metaphors that have shaped the practice of medicine in Western culture and to explore the philosophical roots of the twentieth century model of medicine in an attempt to elucidate the origins and nature of the current "medical crisis". Models and metaphors Metaphors are pregnant analogies,' icons that grasp hold of a pattern and apply that pattern to an area of experience, bundling facts in a meaningful way.2 Metaphors can be used as a kind of lens to focus evidence in patterns that "hang together" or corroborate with the facts of life. As originating insights metaphors can be used to generate cognitive categories. A model is an extended metaphor whose properties and implications have been carefully drawn out and specified. Models organize conceptual systems. They consists of sets of categories invented (not discovered) by the model-maker (either one individual or, more often, the cumulative insight of a whole culture or historical era). Models evolve over time in response to changing conditions. The stubborn facts of the world control the direction the model takes. Stephen Pepper describes their refinement process as follows: Questioned evidence calls for more evidence and for refinement of ' Stephen C. Pepper, World Hypotheses, Berkeley: University of California, 1942, passim. 1 Colin Turbayne, Myth of Metaphor Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1962, passim. 284</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHICAL ROOTS OF THE CURRENT MEDICAL CRISIS 285 concepts . . . This process goes on with wider and wider demands for corroboration.3 When successful, a model and its originating metaphor tend to become invisible. If it is operating satisfactorily, and there is no need to contest it, a model may fall outside the critical awareness of those who use it. But, when a model begins to show inadequacy, that is when it becomes apparent that it is faltering, attention is drawn to it and the model comes into view again. Siegler and Osmond, in their book, Models of Madness; Models of Medicine, note that the medical model, inspite of its great age, has only recently become an object of scrutiny and that the limits of the model are revealed by those elements of health care that are missing. Like the dog that didn't bark in the nighttime in the Sherlock Holmes' story, it is the illness that didn't get diagnosed ... the relief from pain that wasn't given, the family that wasn't treated sympathetically that point to the dimensions of the medical model which would otherwise have escaped our notice.4 The reasons for a model's failure, though frequently complex, often stem from a failure to refine concepts. A failure which inevitably leads to a hardening of categories. Such sequelae may results from reification of the model's originating metaphor. Colin Turbayne, in his book The Myth of Metaphor, points out that, if a metaphor is not used with the awareness that it is a useful fiction; it can deteriorate into a myth.5 It is our contention that the metaphor at the heart of Western medicine has deteriorated into just such a myth and that the crisis in the current health care system is a symptom of this mythology. The crisis in medicine George Engel, professor of psychiatry and medicine at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, says the present crisis in medicine stems from adherence to a model of disease no longer adequate for the scientific tasks and social responsibilities involved in the discipline of medicine. In an article titled "The Need for a New Medical Model; A Challenge to Biomedicine", he says: The dominant model of disease today is biomedical, with molecular biology as its basic scientific discipline. It assumes disease to be fully J Stephen C. Pepper, Concept and Quality, Paul Carus Lecture Series, LaSalle, 111.: Open Court Publishing Co. 1966, 14. 4 Miriam Siegler and H.

MORRISS accounted for by deviations from the norm of measurable biological (somatic) variables.6 Engel claims the model is too narrow in that it "leaves no room within its framework for the social, psychological and behavioral dimensions of illness".7 Studies in recent years have shown that, in spite of the great advances in medical science, the public is not satisfied with the delivery of health care. In a review of some of these studies, Daly &amp; Hulka, Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, note: Expressions of dissatisfaction with medical care have grown in volume and reflect a basic sense of confusion and frustration with the health care system on the part of the general population.8 Public dissatisfaction appears to spring in part from the fragmentation of medical services. The family doctor, with his concern for the individual patient, has all but disappeared. The traditional "art of medicine'' has been replaced by the "science of medicine"9 with its trend toward specialization. Dr. Karen Davis, then chief planner of HEW, recently noted that sixty percent of all doctors are now being trained as specialists while only twenty percent of patient visits require a specialist's care. "The system", she says, "is really out of whack."10 A number of studies have indicated general dissatisfaction with doctor-patient relations as a major factor in fomenting the "crisis". Korsch &amp; Negrete, in their important studies of doctor-patient communication, have found that, though the quality of medical care in the last analysis is dependent on effective interaction between the physician and his patient, "There is abundant evidence that in current practice this interaction is all too often disappointing to both parties."11 Apparently doctor-patient relations have been swept aside by the technology of medicine with all its efficiency and anonymity. In the wake of this shift, the medical profession seems to be alienating the consumer it was intended to serve and has become ' 'unable to deliver to the average member of our society the quality of health care and health education he needs and expects.'"2 It is paradoxical that this crisis in health care ' George Engel "The Need for a New Medical Model: A Challenge to Biomedicine", Science, 196: 4286 (April 1977) passim.

During the past century, advances in medical science have led to unprecedented success in the treatment and cure of disease, but the medical model's failure to deal adequately with the psychosocial aspects of care and the broader health needs of society have become increasingly evident. Addressing the crisis Today serious efforts are being made to address deficiencies that exist in the health care industry. Many medical schools are beginning to place greater emphasis on the humanities and courses in the behavioral sciences are being introduced into the curriculum. Such courses were offered in a few medical schools as far back as 1917u and revived again in the late forties, but the trend was soon overwhelmed by competition with specialization and the information avalanche associated with growing technical knowledge.14 Directors of medical schools have long expressed awareness of the need for education in these areas, but claimed "There is not enough time in the curriculum"13 for all the material a student must learn. Therefore, non-technical skills must be given low priority. Today courses such as medical ethics, communication and death and dying are beginning to be more widely offered, though most frequently as electives." Programs training "physician extenders" have been initiated to address the problem of the shortage of general practitioners. These are educating physician assistants and nurse practitioners to take care of preliminary examinations and diagnosis of routine illnesses potentially reducing the time doctors spend with patients. The rationale for the new middle level professionals includes their ability to provide a kind of care that is more personal and less cloaked in the professional mystique of medicine, as well as their ability to extend medical services to populations not adequately covered by the present system. Within the past ten years efforts have been made to shift graduate medical education away from specialization toward the training of " A. Meyer, Journal of Medical Education, 51: (1976), 602. 14 G.

BOYLE and JAMES E. MORRISS primary care physicians. Departments of family-practice have been established in some medical schools and family-practice residencies have been developed. Such programs are giving greater emphasis to more humanistic attitudes and to the social and behavioral sciences.17 In addition to the new directions in medical education and new specialties designed to redress inadequacies, organizations have emerged to fill the gap where patient needs are not being met. For example, self help groups, such as those of cancer patients (Today is Yours, Make Today Count) or groups of parents of children with cancer (Candlelighters), have mushroomed in recent years. One of the primary goals of such groups is to help provide support in coping with the psychosocial problems related to catastrophic diseases. The hospice is an example of an institution that has emerged in response to a neglected area of medical care. Inspired by the work of Cicely Saunders at St. Christophers, London, hospices have sprung up around the country during the past few years to provide alternative care for the terminally ill. The hospice philosophy attempts to overcome the "stigma of death" in a health care industry where saving the patient is a generally recognized and institutionally supported goal. The emergence of such organizations and institutions and the individual and public concern that brought them about stand witness to areas of outstanding need and testify to the narrowness of the medical model. Are the new courses prescribed for medical education, the added specialties and outside organizations and institutions which have developed during the past few years adequate remedies for the crisis in medicine or are they simply buffers that, while relieving the symptoms, may obscure the deeper source of distress? In order to answer this question, we will examine some of the hidden assumptions originating from the medical model's root metaphor and show how the degeneration of this metaphor into a myth has contributed to the success-failure conundrum which medicine is currently experiencing. Roots of the Western medical model: three metaphors In order to clarify the roots of some of the problems that have led to the "crisis" in Western medicine it will be helpful to examine briefly three metaphors in the history of health care. a) The "primitive" metaphor: Medicine of the Gods b) The "Greek" metaphor: Medicine of Nature c) The "Cartesian" metaphor: Medicine of Mechanics.

In this sense it is not proper to use the term "model". However it is valid to make some broad generalizations regarding primitive medicine. These are as follows: a) Medicine in a primitive setting is more a function of culture than of biology, hence the social aspect of disease and survival is most prominent. b) Disease and death in primitive tribes are explained for the most part in supernatural terms. Anthropological studies suggest that, in traditional prescientific societies, disease and the threat of death are problems of great urgency for the group as a whole. Sickness, disabilities and death provoke disruption in the social network, challenging the general order of life and behavioral norms. They place demands on the accepted value system of the group. Traditionally the cultural response to illness is an effort to place the challenge within a system of beliefs and values, to ease the psychological strain on the victim, his family and the society as a whole and to interpret the threat and its treatment in a way that is meaningful to all concerned. In the primitive view illness was seen as originating in powerful supernatural forces which could threaten the survival of the whole society. Disease was frequently viewed as punishment for violations of well-tried traditions embodied in sacred totems and strict taboos. Rituals or other acts of reparation were often prescribed by medicine men. A preoccupying concern for the primitive was why particular persons should have been singled out for affliction. In spite of our present knowledge regarding the origins of physical afflictions, belief in supernatural causes or disease, though frequently disguised, have by no means died out. Even today physicians are often unaware of the need of the patient to be absolved from the sense of guilt that is frequently associated with severe illnesses and especially in the case of life-threatening or terminal prognosis where the inevitable question arises: "Why me?" Since the primitive believed that more than natural forces caused sickness, the conditions to counter them had to be more than natural. Therapeutic measures were magico-religious involving rituals frequently centering around spells, divination procedures or the trance of the medicine man. The religious ceremonies and magic drugs always encompassed what we might now interpret as psychotherapeutic methods. Since traditional healers did not make a distinction between organic, functional, and mental diseases they did not have to contend</page><page sequence="7">290 JOAN M. BOYLE and JAMES E. MORR1SS with the conflicts which, in modern times have given rise to psychosomatic medicine. For the pre-scientific healer diagnostics was therapeutics; the mental approach was used in the treatment of organic diseases just as organic approaches might be applied in cases of mental disorders. It has been noted that "this unitary character is one of the outstanding traits of primitive medicine.'"8 Medicine men and shamans with their knowledge of the supernatural powers that controlled human destiny, played a priestly role and enjoyed a special status in primitive society. Today physicians have retained not only their high status in society but also some of the more subtle aspects of the priestly role. Perhaps this is because they are frequently in a position to wield power over life and death and even in this scientific age, we still feel that "medicine deals with powerful and mysterious forces not completely amenable to reason."15 Arthur Kleinman has pointed out in his insightful paper on the problems of cross-cultural studies in health care systems, that the simple drawing of the dichotomy between "traditional" (primitive) and "modern" medicine is deceiving in that it does not take into account the cultural and social functions of health care.20 In its broadest sense traditional medicine is a cultural response which attempts to make the stress of illness understandable by placing it in a frame of reference that focuses it within the value system of the cultural concerned. The most prominent disjunction between the explanatory model of traditional medical systems and modern professional medicine rests in the concern of traditional health care with making the experience of illness culturally meaningful and the concern of modern medicine with providing objective, scientific accounts of illness that are devoid of cultural meaning. Kleinman concludes, "Thus, one of the most basic functions of health care seems no longer to be part of the modern profession of medicine. Rather, there is evidence that this crucial health care function in modern medical systems has been left almost entirely to folk and popular sectors. If so then this represents one of the major problems resulting from the impact of modernization and specifically scientific and technological development on systems of medical care."21 This may throw some light on the popular dissatisfaction with the quality and "success" of modern medical care as well as explain the resurgence of folk (including religious) and "holistic" healing practices. 11 E.

Whereas primitive medicine had assumed that, if disease had non-natural causes, non-natural therapies were in order, Greek medicine assumed that nature was a healing force in itself and, therefore, the physician's role was to assist nature. Basically there were three schools of medicine in Greece at that time: the temple school that retained its magico-religious origins and conducted healings in the temples of Aesculapius: the philosophical school that remained mainly theoretical: and the Hippocratic school of rational medicine whose physicians, while retaining the dialectical skills of the philosopher, concentrated on the practical aspects of medical care. Hippocratic doctors were mainly practitioners; craftsmen who were deeply influenced by naturalistic philosophy. The Greek health care model concentrated on preventive medicine rather than on disease. Health was defined as a balance or harmony achieved by proper diet, exercise, recreation and thinking. The ideal was "Kalos Kagathos", or "the beautiful and brilliant", harmony of body and mind. An important key to the success of Hippocratic practitioners was their reliance on observation of the whole course of the disease. Instead of merely recognizing the types of disease, they added the skill of prognosis, judging and predicting its patterns. The treatment of the Hippocratic physician reflects his fundamental approach. It was the treatment of an individual not a disease, and the treatment of the whole body not any part of it.22 This model of the doctor as assistant to nature in her healing ways was largely retained through the centuries that followed. In the second half of the Middle Ages, the physician's work centered on the library and medicine was governed by Greek observations and theories, though many of these were inaccurately interpreted because of faulty copies of original texts. The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries brought with them an increased sense of the individual whose life was represented by a linear metaphor. Birth, living and dying were looked at sequentially, a measurable progression toward an end. The spread of this concept may be related to the development of practical mechanical clocks which became commonplace in the home at that time. Death came to be seen as a point at the end of a line of serial events measurable by a mechanical clock. Curiosity about afterlife and the categories of its rewards and punishment followed, and with all of this, medical folk practices multiplied. Paracelsus, the Renaissance physician, " E. Ackerknecht, op. cit., 64.</page><page sequence="9">292 JOAN M. BOYLE and JAMES E. MORRISS moved medicine away from unquestioning reliance on traditional practices. "Like Hippocrates, he insisted that experience was the best teacher and he strongly influenced practicing physicians all over Europe to adopt the 'clinical' bedside approach to the great benefit of patients."23 Like the early Greek physicians, Paracelsus believed "Nature knows the boundaries of her course." MEDICINE OF MECHANICS Though the Hippocratic oath is still recited by many medical school graduates as part of the rites of passage into the medical profession the roots of the twentieth century model of medicine in America are not found in the Greek medicine of nature. They rather originated in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries with Descartes' mechanistic metaphor. Descartes, in his quest for certitude, argued in the Meditations that extended matter was the defining feature of the physical world and that the laws of mechanics were identical with the laws of nature. Descartes' basic categories named reality in terms of two entities which were seen as equally real and irreducible: mind, which was characterized by thought; and body, which operated by the same mechanical laws that applied to other objects in time and space. Descartes stated the invention of his mechanical metaphor in these words: I have hitherto described this earth and generally the whole visible work as if it were merely a machine in which there is nothing at all to consider except the stages and motions of its parts.24 Because of Descartes' method required advancement from what is simple and evident to the more complex by means of "indubitable" connections the metaphor of mechanism meshed perfectly with his system of thought. He would uncover principles of nature so that one "would no longer be tempted to feel wonder regarding any product of human devising".25 Having studied medicine as well as physics and mathematics Descartes began with zeal to apply his mechanical model to biology and physiology. The human body was envisioned under the not-so-hypothetical metaphor of an "earthly machine" and this metaphor ushered in the vocabulary of cause and effect, mechanical laws of operation and the notion of the whole as the sum of its parts. Because of its great explanatory efficacy the mechanical model was destined to become a fundamental root metaphor of medical science. 23 S. Leff and V. Leff, From Witchcraft to World Health (New York: Macmillan Publ. Co., 1958), 115. " Principles IV, 118. 25 R. Descartes, "The Search After Truth" in Descartes Philosophical Writings, trans, by H. Kemp, New York: The Modern Library 1958, 300.</page><page sequence="10">PHILOSOPHICAL ROOTS OF THE CURRENT MEDICAL CRISIS 293 In his work Descartes gradually became convinced that it would be in medicine that his most important and beneficient discoveries would be made. For, if all bodily processes were mechanistically caused, bodily diseases, once their causes were determined, should be remediable with the same precision and certainty as the disorders of a clock. Mind-body dualism and the dethronement of deity Descartes recognized that the self was not externally related to body as a driver to a machine, rather there was a joint cooperation. The difficulty was, however, that the separation of thought and matter was so strict that it was hard to bridge the gulf with any explanatory category that could catch hold of the reality he had in mind. As philosophers and physicians took up Descartes' categories the mechanical metaphor seemed to dominate the more nebulous picture of thought. H. Butterfield notes that "God" and "soul" escape imprisonment in the process of mechanization as if they were "superadded presences flitting vaporously among cog-wheels, pulleys and steel castings of a relentless world-machine."26 It was difficult to show how these two planes of existence intersected. In the res cogitans Descartes had seized on a rather "vaporous" metaphor, while in the metaphor for body he had struck upon a picture that was familiar and concrete, providing a splendid model for exactitude and order. In short, Descartes conceptual framework failed to provide a metaphor for "thought" that could equally take hold of the imagination. The success of the mechanical model may be attributed not only to a search for rationality and to the growing familiarity with clocks and machines but also to a religious aspiration, "the urge to justify God."21 Within the value system of the time it was feared that there would be something defective in creation, something unworthy of God, should the whole universe not show an interlocking pattern of reasonableness. The desire to free the mind of pan-psychism or magical superstition had moved to the aspiration to demonstrate divine order and self consistency. Yet the very nature of the machine metaphor threatened the relationship of the diety to creation. Newton had worried about the danger of the new science making God superfluous. It is clear that Descartes assigned God not only the role of creator but of maintainer of the vast machine by his "general concourse". Boyle agreed with Descartes. But Newton in his Opticks alots God certain specific tasks in providentially fixing the world when it goes out of gear. The successors of Newton became nervous about the self-sufficiency of mechanism. The same irregularities Newton assigned to the master " H.

MORRISS mechanic's mending were found to be accounted for scientifically and thus the process of entirely eliminating the providential elements of world order progressed inevitably. Huyghens and Leibniz were the first to confine divine activity to creation of a preestablished order. The non-interfering God was born. Eventually it seemed sensible to question whether the vast self perpetuating machine needed any supernatural beginning at all. Regarding this trend Burtt comments: The bulk of thinking men, anthropomorphic in their theology could hardly sense religious validity in such theistic substitutes. For them, so far as they were considerably penetrated with science and philosophy, God had been quite eliminated from the scene, and the only thing left to achieve was a single, final step in the mechanization of existence.58 Hobbes and Locke had already prepared for this step by developing the method of explanation in terms of simplest parts whose temporal relations are conceived solely after the fashion of efficient causality. Purged of theological premises, the logical move is to an ultimate mechanomorphic hypothesis. Hobbes described the human person as a group of material particles, reducing the mind to vital motions and bodies. In the Leviathan he say: For what is the heart but a spring; and the nerves but so many strings; giving motion to the whole body ...29 Descartes' application of the mechanical model to medicine and physiology was furthered by Giovanni Alfonso Borelli (1608-79) whose work On the Motion of Animals represents the supreme example of the science of mechanics applied to the living organism. Friederich Hoffmann, whose ideal was Descartes, in his account of the human brain and nervous system designed a new vocabulary drawn from mechanics and hydrodynamics. His Fundament a Medicinae (1695) was the next logical step in the process whereby the intellectual ferment of the last part of the seventeenth century was directed into the teaching and practice of medicine. Herman Boerhaave, who came to dominate the European medical scene and was the most influential physician in the entire eighteenth century,30 taught what had come to be called "corpuscular philosophy" placing his entire faith in the indispensible knowledge of mechanics in 11 E.

As the founder of modern clinical teaching, Boerhaave passed on to colleagues and students a firmly entrenched and carefully developed philosophy of medicine that profoundly influenced health care practices in subsequent centuries. The influence of Descartes' machine metaphor was pervasive in medicine and philosophy. Many eighteenth century intellectuals were shocked by the devestment of soul and deity in works such as the physician, La Mettrie's 1'Homme Machine and the philosopher D'Holback's Systeme de la Nature. D'Holback's work was the first and only comprehensive defense of atheistic materialism in the Enlightenment and remains a classic text representing the philosophical expression par excellence of modern science. Systeme de la Nature amounts to a thorough going revolution in science and philosophy. D'Holback uses Descartes' categories of matter and motion which he claims are totally determined. "Soul" is seen as an illusion and the only acceptable method for arriving at knowledge in as empirical and rational investigation of matter. Fruits of the machine metaphor The invention of the microscope in the mid-seventeenth century eventually led to the development of the cell theory by Schleiden and Schwann, as well as the work of Pasteur and Koch. Disease, now visible to the clinical eye, became a definable entity, infirmities were given names. Science was setting in place its new structural view of disease. Cellular pathology was defined in 1855 as "the" basic medical science by Virchow, who called on all investigators of nature to be united by this general mechanistic interpretation of life. Cell activity, he claimed, could not be other than mechanical. Virchow had an accompanying dream, however, that medicine could stand as a beacon to the world and lead the way to the betterment of the race because it is a "social science in its very bone and marrow". He said: Let us recall the words of Descartes, who said that if it were at all possible to ennoble the human race the means for this could be found only in medicine.31 Though Virchow's dream was humanistic, his concrete contribution to medicine was a cell theory based on a mechanistic philosophy and this is what remained in the minds of his followers. Descartes' metaphor was now firmly reified. The myth of mechanism The influence of Descartes' mechanistic metaphor has since prevailed in medicine as in other branches of science. Turbayne notes that the " L. Rather, Disease, Life &amp; Man (Stanford, California: Stanford Press, 1958), Intro, 25.</page><page sequence="13">296 JOAN M. BOYLE and JAMES E. MORRISS dogmas of Descartes' position have ever since been so firmly entrenched in scientific minds that anyone who tries to question the mechanistic approach is guilty of more than heresy; he is opposing scientific truth. Using Bertrand Russell's phrase, Turbayne states that one who challenges the model's ultimate categories is: beating his head against the brick wall of science, he is headed for disaster. For his (Descartes') allocation is now a defining feature of science.32 What was a metaphor, a picture invented by the creative imagination to illuminate the evidence "as if it were so", becomes "so". Mechanical laws, instead of being reducible to the activities of the body, become literally identified with body processes. Bodies are seen literally as objects, mechanical entities that could be taken apart and put back together again. Disease becomes "nothing but" a thing; a troublesome entity to be aborted. Turbayne puts it this way: Now reducibility has become reductionism . . .The machine metaphor has become mechanism, for human bodies and clockwork now differ only in degree, not in kind.33 The metaphor has deteriorated into a myth and like the cook who used the recipe and then added the pages to the stew, the users of the mechanical metaphor began to be used by it. The mechanistic model of medicine has been exceedingly successful. In the biology and medicine of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it led to the development of laboratory medicine and technological medicine. The image of the person as a machine is retained. The machine is merely identified as a more complex instrument than before. Laboratory medicine resulted from the extraordinary progress of histology, pathology, physiology and especially pharmacology. It is so called in that the laboratory became the sanctuary of medicine. E. Ackerknecht notes that the new medicine is accompanied by a new difficulty, that of integrating clinical observation with the statistical approach which tends toward "abstract medicine".34 Prediction, repeatability and precision are the keys to successful analytical empiricism. The first half of the twentieth century saw the mushrooming of the pharmaceutical industry and the second half of the century has witnessed the development of medical technology with its implants and transplants. These advances in medical science carried with them three main assumptions: a) that disease can be defined as any significant deviation from the " Turbayne, op. cit., 26. » Ibid, 26. " Ackerknecht, op. cit., 170.</page><page sequence="14">PHILOSOPHICAL ROOTS OF THE CURRENT MEDICAL CRISIS 297 norm of measurable biochemical variables. (This definition sprang naturally from physiochemical reductionism which held dogmatically that all activities of a living organism can be ultimately explained in terms of its molecular parts.); b) medicine's only concern was with disease, e.g. physiochemical conditions which deviated from the norm; c) the primacy of technology (which held dogmatically that all human problems were amenable to technological solutions). H. Fabrega sums it up when he says: In biomedicine, disease signifies an abstract thing or condition that is, generally speaking, independent of social behavior.35 In 1910 the Flexner report, which critically evaluated medical schools in the U.S., had great impact on the profession by leading to higher educational standards with greater emphasis on preparation of students in the basic sciences and research. In the wake of reform in medical education and the increased emphasis on physiochemical reductionism and laboratory experimentation, "cure" of patients came, perhaps unwittingly, to be favored over "care" of patients. Regarding Flexner's influence on education, Engel suggests, "This educational system has produced physicians more concerned with disease than with patients."36 He adds that this is reflected "in the pre occupation of physicians with laboratory and diagnostic procedures, which often is perceived by the patient as indicating disinterest in him as a person."37 It appears that the very techniques invented by physicians to serve their patients' needs, tend to alienate these patients. The metaphor of mechanism coupled with contemporary reliance on drugs and technological solutions have led to a general lack of concern for the psychosocial parameters of patient care. Problems that are not strictly somatic or conditions which are not amenable to pharmacological or surgical solutions are usually considered beyond the limits of the physician's responsibility and expertise. In other words, they fall outside the model. Within the medical ranks the cry arises: "We must concentrate on 'real' disease and not get lost in the 'psychosocial underbrush.'"38 It may be argued, and rightly so, that many health care professionals struggle to retain the posture of "care" in spite of the heavy weight of the system, but these efforts are often uneven and, in the face of the existing demands for efficiency and research, such concerns frequently appear to be too much to expect.

They have become empty categories or myths. Referring to the medical industry as a "health care system" is a semantic description which fosters anticipations incongruous with the "stubborn facts". The consumers of medical services are not receiving "health care", but rather "disease cure". In the Western model of medicine health is negatively defined as an absence of abnormal conditions and, unlike Greek medicine of the past, the current model has given little attention to prevention. Patients rarely go for medical advice except when "sick" and physicians usually treat only those patients they deem sufficiently "ill". Though nutrition and other aspects of health maintenance and disease prevention have recently become popular public preoccupations, efforts to address the needs in this area have originated largely outside the medical profession. In fact, it is a commonly held myth that medicine has been responsible for the improvement in health and the decrease in death rates occurring since the second half of the nineteenth century. It has been shown that the increased understanding of infectious disease and the medical model's engineering approach in the use of drugs and immunization for their treatment has contributed relatively little to the total reduction of mortality.40 The major explanation for the dramatic fall in the number of deaths and the improvement in health lies not in medical intervention, but in the introduction of hygienic measures such as purification of water, efficient sewage disposal, improved food hygiene (particularly the pasteurization of milk which is an item most likely to spread disease), and a major factor was the improvement in nutrition which led to increased resistance to infectious diseases. A recent World Health Organization report on nutrition in developing countries noted that the best vaccine against common infectious diseases is an adequate diet. The medical industry's contribution to the prevention of sickness and premature death will probably remain small as long as surgery and drugs are regarded as the basis of health and the essence of medical care. Today health problems are mainly with noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and cerebrovascular disease. Like the health problems of the past, these conditions involve, though in a different way, environmental influences and the need for behavioral, psychological and social considerations. " Adele D.

Such an adjustment must pay considerable attention to the major determinants of health: to food and the environment . . . and to personal behavior, which should be the concern of every practicing doctor.41 Deeply influenced by the myth of mechanism the medical profession tends to disregard psychosomatic and behavioral aspects of disease though research findings in this area appear promising. In 1946, for example, a study at Johns Hopkins Medical School produced important findings relating to cancer and emotions. Theories about the psychological precursors of cancer had started to be explored during the years around World War II but were not longlasting since "rapid advances in bio-medical research shifted interest away from these concerns".42 The mechanical model of medicine and the view of mind and body as two separate entities fostered the ingrained belief that the body's visceral responses are immune to conditioning. This myth was shattered during the last decade (1960's) by the work of Neal E. Miller and his colleagues at Rockefeller University. Miller demonstrated that visceral and glandular responses can be acquired through classical conditioning.43 These findings suggest that psychosomatic symptoms can be learned and conversely that it may be possible to train people with certain disorders to get well through a technique known as bio-feedback. In the late 1960's Miller and his colleagues at Cornell University Medical Center taught patients with long-standing tachycardia (rapid heartbeat) to maintain slower heart rates. The Gerontology Research Center in Baltimore used such therapeutic learning successfully in treating cardiac arrhythmias (disorders of heartbeat rhythm) and, at the New York University School of Medicine epileptic patients learned to reduce seizures by suppressing abnormal brainwaves through voluntary control.44 During the 1970's feedback training has continued to meet with some success in the control of other disorders long believed to be exempt from psychological effects. For example, the behavioral route, at present, appears to offer the best hope for chronic pain, which is coming to be acknowledged as a disease in itself rather than a symptom.45 Recent " Ibid, 67.

BOYLE and JAMES E. MORR1SS research with hypnosis and placebos suggest that people are able to activate their own pain inhibitory system.46 The exciting possibility of applying psycho-therapeutic and behavioral techniques should be investigated vigorously at both the clinical and experimental level. Traditionally, however, research in psychosomatic medicine has received meager funding and since reports of studies in this area seldom appear in major medical journals they are usually ignored by physicians. In addition, systems of reimbursement for medical care often pay only for radical physical interventions, such as drugs and surgery. The powerful financial forces that lobby for or fund research influence its direction and in this century pharmaceutical and technological rather than psychological and behavioral solutions have been favored, though the latter will certainly have to be considered, if the model chooses to broaden its definition of "health". Lorenz K.Y. Ng, of the National Institute of Mental Health, has noted that the "apparent dichotomy (the "Cartesian" duality that has been hanging around our necks for 300 years) could be resolved if the focus of all medical care were on furthering wellness — physical, emotional and social . . . ,"47 The word "care" in "health care" carries connotations of concern for personhood, but the disease focus of modern medicine has, it seems, turned "care" into a myth. The current model, shaped as it was by the seventeenth century machine metaphor, has concentrated primarily on "cure". In fact, the model's focus on mechanism has given rise to what might be considered the ultimate medical myth, the defeat of death. Emil Freireich, Chief of Research in Hematology, University of Texas Cancer Center, has said: Why should anyone in good conscience, who knows what I know, who stands in the posture of being able to create as I have . . . imagine that death is part of life ... I will tell you this and this is a professional statement, not an amateur one: I don't know of any causes of death, other than disease. If that's the case, and if we can understand disease and manipulate it, then I think one of the options that people must consider for themselves is the possibility of life forever.48 The development of new diagnostic techniques and life-prolonging technologies has spawned a "new population" of patients who are living with the knowledge that they are dying. These patients are ironically among medical model's most vocal critics. Their complaints, however, are often not about medicine's failure to cure their disease, but rather its " Ibid, 485.

Medicine's explicitly stated and organizationally supported "ideal" of preserving life at all cost frequently conflicts with the awareness that prolonging may be useless and unduly painful, but that "ideal" often wins out. Since "cure" rather than "care" is the medical model's primary preoccupation, the "incurably ill" are frequently seen as "medical failures". Though dying is a frequent clinical condition (There are approximately 1.5 million terminally ill patients in the United States) and though it has been estimated that eighty-four percent of all deaths in America occur in hospitals or other "health care" institutions, dying is a condition that is rejected by the medical model. "Disease cure" masquerading as "health care" has produced serious dissatisfactions. Restricted by its negative concept of health and by its failure to consider the whole person, the medical profession is, today, hearing cries of "crisis" and experiencing pressures for change. In spite of the unparalleled successes of Western medicine the medical model has revealed its limits. William James once noted that the principal weakness of the American character is the tendency to worship "the bitch goddess success". Yet he believed that in the long run people could not continue to believe what is false, not because truth extracts from them a categorical imperative, but because experience is in itself compelling.4' It has been noted by a leading researcher in medical anthropology that medical science is "the last science to elaborate a meta-scientific inquiry into its theoretical underpinnings". Thus the profession has "made do with outmoded conceptual paradigms because it has refrained from vigorously examining its theoretical structure".50 Whether or not we are able to resolve the "health care" crisis depends, in the last analysis, on our ability to recognize it for what it is, understand its origins and, by bringing the true nature of the medical model's failure into full awareness, be able to make conscious decisions regarding the course of action needed. These will undoubtedly be difficult decisions for they appear to involve the need for model revisions and perhaps a new metaphor.
