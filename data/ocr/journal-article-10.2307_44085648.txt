Painting by George Stubbs (1724-1806).</page><page sequence="2">KURT FOSSO "Sweet Influences" Animals and Social Cohesion in Wordsworth and Coleridge, 1794-18001 How he would place his hand beside his ear ; His little hand , the small forefinger up, And bid us listen! - Samuel Taylor Coleridge, "The Nightingale" Were a seventeenth-century English painter to travel in time to a gal- lery in the latter half of the eighteenth century he or she might well exclaim, wide-eyed, "Where did all the animals come from?" For the animals depicted in those portraits and landscapes had somehow mi- grated from the backgrounds they had previously inhabited to become foregrounded pictorial subjects in themselves: cattle in fields, dogs and horses standing alone or beside proud owners, horses arranged like Grecian statuary, wild birds, exotic lions, and inquisitive monkeys painstakingly depicted in quasi-natural habitats. Where indeed had all these animals come from, and why were they here?2 The phenomenon of George Stubbs (1724-1806), the renowned En- glish "horse painter," would itself have shocked our traveler. To take but one example from his oeuvre, Stubbs's portrait of "Captain Samuel Sharpe Pocklington with His Wife, Pleasance, and (?) His Sister Frances" (1769; see facing page), although certainly anthropocentrically enough titled and most likely commissioned as a marriage portrait, is really a painting of Captain Pocklington's horse. Whether or not the Captain or his wife was cognizant of this fact, Stubbs, whose popular Anatomy of the Horse had been published three years before in 1766, was clearly using the much-prized animal not just as the group portrait's focus but as its main point of interest. It is the horse around whom the three</page><page sequence="3">2 ISLE human figures are posed, and it is the horse, not the good Captain, who receives Mrs. Pocklington's affectionate attentions. In his lifetime Stubbs painted many such works, including horse portraits like the well-known "Whistlejacket" (1762) and the series of equine formal stud- ies, "Mares and Foals" (1762-68, 1776), as well as numerous paintings of dogs and more exotic creatures - lions, zebras, and the occasional rhinoceros. Stubbs had made a career of it. Similarly John Constable's landscape paintings are populated by as many animals as people, with animals frequently serving as a work's focus or focusing agent, as in "The Hay Wain" (1821) and "Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows" (1829), in each of which a lone, atten- tive dog (the sole depicted observer) directs the viewer's gaze to a dra- matic animal scene of wain-pulling horses.3 In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries such animal-oriented representations were by no means merely familiar subject matter or handy rhetorical tools, readily substitutable by other signs. On the contrary, they were funda- mentally tied to Englishmen's shifting social existence, as indices of change, of difference, and of identity.4 Not coincidentally, and for more than a few thinkers of the time not a little fortuitously, the human monarchy of nature had itself recently been reconceptualized under Linnaeus's new system of animal classi- fication.5 A Copernican revolution all its own, the Linnaean taxonomy, as utilized by English natural scientists like Erasmus Darwin (grand- father of Charles), resituated humankind as one animal among many other similar, interconnected species. Hence, in the preface to his epi- demiological taxonomy, Zoonomia (1794), 6 Darwin could argue that while the "Creator of all things has infinitely diversified the works of his hands," he has also "stamped a certain similitude on the features of nature, that demonstrate to us, that the whole is one family of one par- ent" (B). Darwin's metaphor of the family aptly sums up the then- emerging view of the biological commonality of all creatures - a view that posited creatures' mutual bonds and shared affections - and also significantly implies the social connections within and between spe- cies. In the widely popular natural histories by Buffon and Bewick, one similarly finds animals' social nature to be a foregrounded con- cern, their illustrations depicting animals in "clearly defined social setting[s]," with careful attention also given to their relationship to human economy (Potts 18). In a manner equally typical of this dynamic era, Darwin moreover holds the source of human virtue itself to rest in "our intellectual sympathies with ... the miseries, or with the joys, of our fellow creatures" (255).7 Our connection to animals is for him, as for others of his time, dependent upon our sympathetic identification with these "our fellow creatures." In this way, eighteenth-century natu-</page><page sequence="4">" Sweet Influences Wordsworth and Coleridge 3 ral history presented to British men and women not just a further blow to traditional notions of the place of human beings - "a dissolution and reconstitution of conceptual patterns by which natural phenom- ena had been understood" (Kroeber 18) - but also an important means of re-envisioning humankind's proper place in the social and natural fabric: as a part of a unifying (albeit for some thinkers also a dislocat- ing8 ) whole of interconnected species. In Romantic Ecology (1991) Jonathan Bate argues that what poets like William Wordsworth added to this new matrix of an interrelated eco- system or "economy of nature" (the English title of one of Linnaeus's essays) was their "emphasis on a symbiosis between the economy of nature and the activities of humankind": the Words worthian "'one life' within us and abroad" (39-40). 9 And, as James Turner observes, this is where animals "came in," answering the psychological call on the part of late-eighteenth-century men and women for a "bulwark" against "the wrenching changes wrought by factory and city" (31-33). The enor- mous popularity of animals in the period, both in paintings and in zoos, can of course be attributed to other factors as well, ranging from an urban population's nostalgia for rural times and places past10 to a growing empire's appetite for exoticism.11 But turn-of-the-century ani- mal representations particularly responded to the anxieties and de- sires prompted by social and political change - by revolution, war, domestic disrule, and reform - and by the era's "wrenching" economic transformations. At a time when age-old "securities of class and status and theological assumptions" were themselves being shattered (McFarland 20), wheri distrust of government and the old orthodoxies was at an all-time high, and when fissures and outright abysses could be glimpsed within England's social, political, and economic landscape, artists responded to these historical pressures by attempting in their works to discover and represent new forms of social organization and of subjectivity.12 And it is in this cultural project that animals came into the picture. Indeed, for Romantic artists, animals particularly satisfied a desire to find alternative, local, and noneconomic means of human connec- tion - a social appeal that is especially prominent in the late-eighteenth- century poetry of Wordsworth and of his friend and occasional col- laborator Samuel Taylor Coleridge. During the especially turbulent years from 1794 to 1800 (including the high points of the Terror and of the war), these two poets seek to depict in their poetry new forms of social cohesion and identity, based upon lasting bonds with the power to "bind all men together" (Eisold 122). Their sociological project leads them to represent communities articulated by mysterious human-ani- mal linkages, as in Wordsworth's "Lines Written in Early Spring," from</page><page sequence="5">4 ISLE his and Coleridge's Lyrical Ballads of 1798. Here Wordsworth describes his experience of nature as a product of his abiding belief (likely owed in part to Darwin) that the "human soul" is intricately linked to nature's "fair works" (11. 5-6). For Karl Kroeber this provocative hypothesis in fact implies the speaker's understanding that "all human cultures are constructed by natural creatures" (45). And the poet's belief indeed suggests not just his pantheism but also his understanding of a pro- found social connection between human beings and animals, one with the potential to form a "true community . . . / Of many into one incor- porate," as Wordsworth describes matters in Home at Grasmere (MS. B.819-20). To a diseased social-political world "where no brotherhood exists" (1805 Prelude 2.404), human and animal relationships offer to these poets important potential bonds for human connection: "mys- teries of passion which have made, / And shall continue evermore to make . . . / One brotherhood of all the human race" (10.84-88). While Coleridge himself winced at Wordsworth's "One Life" pan- theism (despite the fact that Wordsworth had gleaned much of it from him), and, according to Kroeber, would in later years "devote major energies ... to defending a transcendental vision of divinity hostile to Romantic proto-ecological nature poetry" (67), in the waning years of the eighteenth century he generally shared his friend's "proto-ecologi- cal" orientation and belief in the divine, and notably social, powers of nature's animals. Notably, in Coleridge's "Fears in Solitude" (1798), the poet, fearing a rumored French invasion of England, finds consola- tion that in a "spirit-healing nook" a man still may lie on fern or withered heath, While from the singing lark (that sings unseen The minstrelsy that solitude loves best), And from the sun, and from the breezy air, Sweet influences trembled o'er his frame. . . . (12-21) Communion with nature's "best" minstrel produces in the quiet lis- tener "[r]eligious meanings" and "dreams of better worlds" (24, 26) set in stark contrast to a violent world of "[i]nvasion," "fear and rage, / And undetermined conflict" (36-38), a world made all the more des- picable by these contrasting, nature-bestowed dreams of more tran- quil "society" (218). Nature's harmony here has the power to guide the self from such alienating political preoccupations to "[l]ove, and the thoughts that yearn for human kind" (232) - thoughts of one's natu- ral connection to one's "brethren" (155). Like the well-known dictum of Wordsworth's Prelude, that love of nature leads to love of human- kind, these lines by Coleridge describe nature's active involvement in fostering community And although the lark's music is missing from</page><page sequence="6">" Sweet Influences "-ě Wordsworth and Coleridge 5 the poem's concluding description of a now "silent dell" (228) (and even may have been owed to the poet's recollection of a past visit), at the outset that songbird, singing "unseen / The Minstrelsy that soli- tude loves best" like some "angel in the clouds," singularly contrib- utes to those vital "sweet influences" that tremble over the speaker (19-21, 28), eliciting both his "melancholy" thoughts about his warring "human brethren" (32) and his more hopeful visions of "better worlds" populated by animals and (animal-) loving human beings. Coleridge's earlier poem "To A Young Ass" (1794), popular enough to have been lampooned by Lord Byron, similarly represents animals as makers or markers of community and communitarian feeling. It also presents the animal as an emblem of oppression, the "[p]oor little Foal of an oppressed Race" (l).13 The speaker exclaims, "I hail thee Brother - spite of the fool's scorn! / And fane would take thee with me, in the Dell / Of Peace and mild Equality to dwell" (26-28). The latter refer- ence is to Coleridge's and Robert Southey's Utopian scheme, "Pantisocracy," but we should not let their failure ever to realize that idealized dell overshadow the poem's more immediate aims,14 akin in their way to the French Revolution's own (by then exploded) goals of "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity." The " Brother " foal, italicized in Coleridge's text arguably to emphasize its revolutionary significance,15 is to be set free - so the speaker would wish - to dwell in "mild Equal- ity" with the poet and his fellow pantisocrats, in a life of work and playful "bray[s] of joy" (34-35). The poem's animal addressee thus serves not just as an exemplum of rural poverty's brutalizing effects but also as a sign and source of resistance to just such economic brutalization. For the speaker, true brotherhood, not to mention true equality and liberty, must include the foal. In this Coleridgean mani- festo of sorts, the principal source of social cohesion rests in the social- izing sympathies the foal itself occasions and which its liberated brays repeatedly confirm, in stark contrast to the caged bird in the imprison- ing city, whose "warbled melodies" merely "soothe to rest / The ach- ing of pale Fashion's vacant breast!" (35-36). Wordsworth's "Poor Susan," from Lyrical Ballads of 1800, also de- scribes a caged bird's song, heard by Susan from a London street cor- ner. That lone thrush's singing prompts her to daydream of remem- bered "Green pastures ... in the midst of the dale, / Down which she [had] so often . . . tripp'd with her pail" (9-10). In lines later excised at Charles Lamb's urging, the poem's speaker goes on to chastise Susan as a "Poor Outcast" (perhaps a prostitute, then no uncommon condi- tion) who should return to her father's rustic home and, having re- placed her fancy loomed dress for a "plain russet" home-spun gown, once again hear a "thrush sing from a tree of its own" (17-20). Here too</page><page sequence="7">6 ISLE the countryside is depicted as an ideal dell of free animals and con- comitantly liberated human beings. By contrast, the city is a place of imprisoned humans and animals alike. At the same time, of course, such liberating communitarian contact with animals is in some man- ner occasioned by, or is at least responsive to, their past and present suffering. To return for a moment to Wordsworth's "Lines Written In Early Spring," we find its poet similarly seeking social connection and be- longing, his desires' fulfillment resting in his firm "faith that every flower / Enjoys the air it breathes" (11-12). Yet the flowers' enjoyment of their life processes is, like the thoughts of the birds hopping about nearby him, an experience he "cannot measure" (14). This conclusion of his is more than a poetical jab at Enlightenment rationalism's ten- dency to quantify and calculate all things. For these creatures, although sentient and pleasure-loving like the speaker himself, serve as a "mea- sure" of his difference from them, as well as from those men unable or unwilling to accept a faith established in opposition to "[w]hat man has made of man" (8). Such faith implicitly seeks a missing or lost form of social cohesion, a form the poem's speaker lacks and therefore de- sires. Still, despite his depressing awareness of his alienation from his destructive fellow human beings, the poet points to what in Wordsworth's and Coleridge's poetry proves to be an implicit basis for human connection and for humanity's amelioration: that, in spite of, or because of, animals' difference from human.beings, nature's crea- tures nevertheless have this power to "link" together the "human soul" that runs as one life through living things. As other works by Wordsworth and Coleridge reveal, it is in fact this irreducible differ- ence between animals and human beings that ultimately makes such linkages between modern people possible, and even necessary. "What man has made" of animals, and what animals in turn can make of man, becomes a basis, even the sole basis, for community. Coleridge's "The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem," also from Lyri- cal Ballads (1800), while of paramount importance in this social articu- lation of human beings and animals, may well at first seem an odd choice, for it is clearly skeptical about at least some of the connections poets discern between humankind and nature's animals (those ani- mals' thoughts being immeasurable even in Wordsworth's more opti- mistic "Lines"). Indeed, Coleridge's poem starkly decries our narcis- sistic tendency to transform nature into but a distorted mirror of our- selves. In a notable turn against classical and Miltonie tradition, and against the "pity-pleading strains" of his own prior poem "To A Night- ingale," Coleridge's speaker insists instead that the singing nightin- gale, rather than being "melancholy," is "full of love / And joyance"</page><page sequence="8">" Sweet Influences "ģ. Wordsworth and Coleridge 7 (15, 42-43). The Oxford English Dictionary notes that the Spenserian word joy ance was, according to Samuel Johnson's own lexicographical judg- ment, obsolete by the eighteenth century. The antiquated term was then reintroduced by none other than Coleridge (and Southey), to become a favorite archaism of later poets (e.g., Percy Shelley, in "To A Skylark"). Coleridge had first recoined the word "joy ance" in "Lines on an Au- tumnal Evening" (1796), and then chose to redeploy the term in "The Nightingale," with the reasonable expectation of the word's antique strangeness to his readers. The term "joyance" interestingly denotes as much an activity as a state of feeling or being, referring, unlike the common word "joy," both to feeling joy and to the action of showing it (OED). The archaism thus serves to underline animal nature's active role in altering human feel- ing: its power to help compose in the listener an active, participatory joy similar to animals' own. Yet while the word "joyance" suggests an active role for nature's creatures16 and their "sweet influences," at the same time the term's use in these lines also reveals its human authors' limits. Coming as the word does on the heels of the poet's impassioned condemnation of past poets' attributions of "melancholy" to the famed songbird, his own corrective perceptions of "love" and "joyance" in the bird's song must also raise suspicions. Is not his revisionist view but the narcissistic antithesis of the rejected Miltonie, and prior Coleridgean, perspective, exchanging avian sadness for avian happi- ness? While one should think it true that in nature there indeed is "noth- ing melancholy," given such anti-anthropomorphic, anti-anthropocen- tric logic as the speaker has proposed, can sentient nature be said to be full of active "joyance" either?17 In this particular context, the word joyance itself becomes increasingly suspect: as a term that signifies not just being but showing : display, semblance, and, by implication, per- ception (as well as misperception). The reader might also raise a skeptical eyebrow when the poet pro- ceeds to describe the singing nightingale as "disburthen[ing]" his "full soul" in an expressive activity analogous to the actions of Coleridge's own proper poet, who similarly "surrender[s] his whole spirit" (48, 29). Such identifications again smack of anthropomorphic narcissism (not to mention of the pathetic fallacy), especially in light of the poet's prior indictment of the solipsistic penseroso whose "melancholy" per- sonifications - bad figures of speech - merely tell back "the tale" of his "own sorrows" (20-21). Given Coleridge's staunch rejection of just such artificial "conceit[s]" (23), his treatment of the bird's "joyance" gener- ates troublesome contradictions indeed, contradictions that in turn point to significant problems of perceiving and representing animals (mir- ing the "One Life" doctrine in something of an epistemologica! quan-</page><page sequence="9">8 ISLE dary). The singing bird, appropriately and traditionally unseen, in this way remains intriguingly beyond the culturally constraining powers of human categorization and understanding. And, in this way, as a text "The Nightingale" provides within itself a curious resistance to its own anthropomorphic reductions, a resistance significant to the poem's implicit promise of community. This social lesson is revealed principally in the closing lines' repeated adieus to the bird and to its audience of friends: "Once more, farewell, / Sweet Nightingale! once more, my friends! farewell" (109-10). The salutation forms a chiasmus of addresses and addressees: farewell nightingale X friends farewell This rhetorical figure serves, along with the associative repetition of the lines' adverbial phrases ("Once more," "once more"), to conflate the avian singer with its human audience. The chiasmus thus figura- tively connects the bird and its crowd of listeners as one community, engaged in a type of nocturnal conversation. The human friendships of course to some extent precede this meeting in the company of the nightingale (and of its fellow singers in nearby fields), yet the meeting is nonetheless occasioned by the bird's auditory presence. Indeed, the propinquity of "loitering" listeners (89) is made possible only by the animal "joyance" produced by the nightingale's "love-chant[sj" (48) - chants that will in turn lead to the next night's anticipated, consolidat- ing farewells: "till tomorrow eve, ... a short farewell" (87-88). For, as the poet proclaims, such bird-song is the stuff of answer and provoca- tion, of "skirmish and capricious passagings, / And murmurs musical and swift jug jug" (58-60). The phrase "jug jug" itself merits attention. The word jug was one commonly used to signify the notes of nightingales and other song- birds, and so has more sense than nonsense about it (although, as any- one who has heard a nightingale can attest, such words as this are clearly conventional and arbitrary rather than motivated and, for lack of a better word, natural). Coleridge here strikes a position between cul- tural revision and traditionalism, arguing for nonmelancholy, perhaps even nonjoyful, "skirmish," and for so customary a description as "jug jug." At the same time, such jugging does "bid" us to listen (96), while at the same moment importantly frustrating our attempts to interpret, let alone to reproduce, the song. Rather like the poet's child, who though "Nature's play-mate" yet "[m]ars" all its sounds "with his imitative lisp" (92-97), the speaker and his friends mar the bird's inimitable sing-</page><page sequence="10">" Sweet Influences "-ē Wordsworth and Coleridge 9 ing, and in fact seem to be drawn together night after night by what the nocturnal scene precisely does not provide them: by what their lan- guage of poetic archaisms and other suspect figures of speech cannot reproduce "once more" (109-110). For the adult friends, as for the child, the nightingale's "love-chant" (48) remains a "fast thick warble" of notes "delicious" for their difference, resistance, and mystery. Such resistance to knowing bids the bird's human listeners return to become more "[f] amiliar" with enchanted song that remains strange. And in seeking this familiarity with animals the listeners are thereby themselves nightly associated in a ritual-like gathering of initiates poised on the episte- mologica! verge of their own delimiting perceptions. "The Nightin- gale" is in this way very much a "conversation poem," as Coleridge subtitled it, but one of limits and transgressions, in which human and animal discourse produces a kind of social conversion based upon lin- guistic and other forms of discord, violence, and desire. And, as shall be shown, this marring and atonement are themselves really key parts of a deeper Coleridgean and Wordsworthian schema of human and animal "society": as a collective of "sweet influences" prompted by animal "mysteries of passion," including suffering and sacrifice. While it might at first appear to be a quite different human/ animal scheme that we encounter in Coleridge's well-known lyrical ballad, The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere (1797-98), in fact this poem makes even clearer the violence (a markedly physical violence) and atoning acts of sympa- thy and story-telling that underlie animal-based community. James McKusick sees the story's Mariner, a sea-farer cursed for his thoughtless shooting of an albatross, as at the outset "a Cartesian dualist, a detached observer cut off from any feeling of empathy or participation in the vast world of life that surrounds him," but who is eventually transformed into a Linnaean or Darwinian self "released from his state of alienation from nature" (385).18 For, according to McKusick, the Mariner learns "what the Albatross came to teach him: that he must cross the boundaries that divide him from the natural world, through unmotivated acts of com- passion between 'man and bird and beast'" (3 87). This moral, which Coleridge later criticized as being too explicit, is well known even to those unfamiliar with the poem, being a message proffered by Goody Two-Shoes and other children's books of the eighteenth century:19 He prayeth best who loveth best, All things both great and small: For the dear God, who loveth us, He made and loveth all. (647-50) Oddly, and in contradistinction to Anna Barbauld's, Erasmus Darwin's, and others' belief that the humane treatment of animals was a key</page><page sequence="11">10 ISLE means to human moral improvement - for Barbauld, specifically for improving the lower and middle classes - it is because of the Mariner's murderous disregard for one of God's beloved creatures that he comes to be morally improved. His release from the curse placed upon him is earned, as he himself sees it, by his unconscious blessing of other, de- cidedly less desirable creatures: "water-snakes" swimming alongside his ship. "O happy living things!" he cries in a heart-felt "spring of love" (274, 276). By blessing them "unaware" (277), without ulterior motivation, the Mariner earns the pity of two local nature spirits, one of whom he overhears proclaim to the other that, "the man hath pen- ance done, / And penance more will do" for having offended a fellow- spirit who "lov'd the bird that lov'd the man / Who shot him with his bow" (409-10). However just or unjust the Mariner's divine punish- ment may be, his show of love for animals spares him the gruesome, zombie-like life-in-death inflicted upon his shipmates (who had first condemned but then praised his murder of the albatross, making them, in the words of the poem's later-added commentary, "accomplices in the crime"). It also leads him, by these mysterious rites of suffering, to regard all life, both human and animal, as sacred and interconnected. But "penance more" is nonetheless owed the natural world, and it is in this indebtedness that the social aspects of Coleridge's sea-tale are re- vealed. At his tale's end the Mariner relates how, his ghost ship having sunk off the shore of his native land, he at once found himself stricken With a woeful agony, Which forc'd me to begin my tale And then it left me free. Since then at an uncertain hour Now oftimes and now fewer, That anguish comes and makes me tell My ghastly aventure. (612-18) The Mariner thereupon must tell that chosen listener the tale and its compassionate moral. The narrative in this way provides an explana- tory coda of its origins: that "penance" owed for animal murder (what the shipmates misinterpreted as beneficent sacrifice) drives the narra- tive to be rehearsed (reproduced and exchanged), in order, one must suspect, to disseminate this hard-won wisdom about humankind's treatment of, and moral dependence upon, animals. Hence, the Mariner's narrative is one we overhear as it is told by him to a di- verted, spell-bound "wedding-guest," at that most traditional and so- cial of rituals, a marriage - a setting that underlines the tale's social significance. "[S]tunn'd" and "of sense forlorn" from the tale's telling,</page><page sequence="12">" Sweet Influences": Wordsworth and Coleridge 1 1 the guest arises the next day a "sadder and a wiser man" (655-59), his altered condition a result of that narrative. Such learning about ani- mals and human beings completes what might well be called an eco- communitarian circuit, manifesting as it does a system of intertwined human and animal (and divine) relationships transgressed against in the Mariner's ignorant slaughter of the albatross and then repaired, in part, by his benediction to the water-snakes and his subsequent trans- missions of wisdom to a series of (presumably) distraught but en- thralled "guests." Accompanying this animal-oriented wisdom is the underlying guilt upon which such narratives as these and their implicit cultures are based: a sacrificial,20 originary before whose knot of sin cannot be un- done but whose irredeemable violence makes atonement and its to- temie human-animal wisdom possible. Narrative in The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere is in this way eucharistie and guilt-ridden; hence, perhaps, the poem's oddly irreconcilable Christian imagery, including the Mariner's "cross bow" (79), a weapon that for McKusick embodies both the "destructive tendency" of technology and "the traditional Christian imagery of sacrifice and atonement" (386). (The dead alba- tross itself substitutes for a cross when the sailors hang it around the Mariner's neck). Coleridge's poem in this way presents a genealogy of human violence and atonement regarding animals, and reveals itself to be predicated, as a narrative, upon such transgressions and their authors' attempts to amend them. Yet, as the poem makes clear, such acts of atonement are never enough. The mariner's guilt is, rather like his tale (and like Adam's own sin), irrevocable and perpetual, and yet also consolidating of relationships ("love") between human beings and animals and between those who grieve and atone; in this case, between a sad guest and his haunted mariner-host. Like other such transformational tales, the Mariner's narrative of sacrifice and atonement is ambivalently predicated upon animal dif- ference and relatedness ("He made and loveth all"),21 an acknowledg- ment of the commonality and otherness upon which human-animal relationships, here as in "The Nightingale" and in Wordsworth's "Lines," are inherently founded and structured. Coleridge's Ancyent Marinere is in this sense an allegory not just of human benevolence toward animals - an RSPCA forerunner of sorts - but of the binding invisible connections between human and animal realms. It tells how such connections can form communities of human beings bonded by their shared observance of past transgression and present or future atonement. The perpetuity of the narrative and its serial community of tellers and listeners indeed argues for the long journey such wisdom requires. In fact, as we find in Wordsworth's "Hart-Leap Well" (1799)</page><page sequence="13">12 ISLE and Home at Grasmere (1800), such community is never won easily nor ever entirely; it is attained only through violence and the post hoc la- menting of what "man" has done to animal. In Home at Grasmere Wordsworth describes his and Dorothy's jour- ney into Grasmere's inclement vale. He lingers, as they lingered then, entranced in the locale of Hart-leap Well, which auspiciously intimated to them a "milder day" and "fairer world" to come (B.237-38). This locodescriptive passage is also an intertextual one, alluding to Wordsworth's previously mentioned, appositely titled lyrical ballad "Hart-Leap Well." The latter poem recalls the medieval knight Sir Walter's renowned chasing down of a hart, which then killed itself in its last of three desperate leaps, leaving the spot "curs'd," for "a mur- der ha[d] been done, / And blood cries out for blood" (124, 141-42). As Raimonda Modiano points out, "by voluntarily leaping to its death" the deer transformed a hunt into a sacrifice; hence Sir Walter's ritualis- tic raising of three stone pillars to commemorate the dead stag (497). And yet Walter's act of memorialization seems ultimately inconsequen- tial or impious, due perhaps to its lack of the atonement required for such acts of sacrifice and commemoration. "Without mourning," Modiano observes, Walter's action becomes "profane" (499), a "mur- der," in the words of the poem. David Perkins sees this hunter's killing of the hart as an act of "solipsistic egoism," similar in its way to the Mariner's own "egoistic self-assertion" and rightly memorialized not just by the pillars but by the adjacent pleasure house Walter builds as an expression of his selfish, libidinal desire (439). In lieu of its proper mourning, the hart's death is lamented, we learn, not just by the poem's narrator and tale-telling shepherd but also by nature itself. "This beast not unobserv'd by Nature fell," the poet states, "[h]is death was mourn'd by sympathy divine" (163-64). The animal's "murder" has for the narrator two important "lesson[s]" to teach: first, that we ought never to "blend our pleasure or our pride / With sorrow of the mean- est thing that feels" (179-80), and second, as in the Ancyent Marinere, that nature's "Being" "[maintains a deep and reverential care" for those "quiet creatures whom he loves" (167-68, 177-80). Yet while "Hart-Leap Well" does in some sense represent an ecological interpénétration of cultural and natural observances - "how the conventionally antago- nistic 'cultural' and 'natural' may in fact felicitously interanimate" (Kroeber 55) - the poem ultimately presents a picture less of human- animal felicity than of struggle, at least of past struggle. In Home at Grasmere it is at this ambivalent topographical and intertextual spot of Hart-leap Well that Wordsworth and Dorothy, still transfixed in "awful trance," receive the quasi-religious "intimation of the milder day / Which is to come, the fairer world than this" (238-39).</page><page sequence="14">" Sweet Influences Wordsworth and Coleridge 13 This prognosis or prophecy, owed to their more proper observance of past animal suffering, becomes its own form of sacred election, raising them up: dejected as we were Among the records of that doleful place By sorrow for the hunted beast who there Had yielded up his breath (240-43) In their "trance" the poet and his sister experience a religious "Vision of humanity and of God / The Mourner, God the Sufferer" (243-44) - of God the Paschal Lamb - that re-emphasizes this passage's intertextual connection to animal sacrifice and to the ritualized eucha- ristie fellowship that such death or suffering can make possible. In their ambivalent intermingling of "sadness" and "joy" at this past prospect of a creature "suffering] wrongfully" the thoughtful couple finds, sig- nificantly, a "promise": that through their observance of past sacrifice - their Christian-like sacralizing of a prior profane "murder" - their "love" and "knowledge" might "secure" them a "portion" of nature's benevolence (247-55). On the one hand, Wordsworth of course simply hopes that in a world where the death of a hart is signified by nature the lives of humans will receive a similarly blessed accounting. But, on the other hand, as this strange "episode in mourning" shows, it is hu- mans rather than nature spirits who must first undertake such rectify- ing work (Modiano 499). Their requisite mourning in turn implies that animal death, nature's "tribute of inevitable pain" (1. 841), is what provides the lasting basis for Wordsworthian dwelling and community in Grasmere: first pro- faning violation (botched animal sacrifice, "murder"), then sacralizing compensation of human sorrow, and finally the hoped-for blessings of fellowship and dwelling such observance may bequeath - blessings that, the poet and his sister hope, may extend beyond a solitary "pair seceding from the common world" to encompass "all the Vales of the earth and all mankind" (249, 256).22And yet, in the intertextual do- main of these closely linked poems, at least one question remains. Might this couple's aforementioned "joy" at a retrospect of animal suffering, given such joy's proscription in the first of the two lessons of "Hart- Leap Well," profane their commemoration of the hart, thus marring their communitarian fortunes? If such mingling of "joy" and "sadness" at the hart's death makes mourning incomplete or improper, would matters then require, as in Coleridge's sea-tale, that further narratives or revisitations be proffered? Profanation may be unavoidable here, as animal death in Wordsworth and Coleridge ever wavers between mur- der and sacrifice. At the same time, such ambivalent failure and in-</page><page sequence="15">14 ISLE completeness may also serve to afford people, in Home at Grasmere as in both "The Nightingale" and The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere, fur- ther possibilities for real social cohesion. However one in fact sorts out this dilemma, the couple's sense of be- longing to a place, and their concomitant sense of belonging to another - of "twain" made "pair" - is grounded in their, and in their hoped-for community's, uneasy relationship to animals. Their prospect of dwelling in the death-shadowed valley will be secured by their love for the sacred murdered hart and their (insufficient) sadness at its loss - in a commu- nity that is, in contrast to what the poem's speaker espouses, necessarily not "without dependence or defect, / Made for itself and happy in itself, / Perfect Contentment, Unity entire" (167-70). For such community in Grasmere is neither independent nor even necessarily "happy in itself"; it is uneasily dependent upon prior animal death for its blessings. If Grasmere is a "unity," then, it is a totemie and a eucharistic one, com- prised of mournful humans and mourned animals, and founded in vio- lence and ensuing practices of commemoration. As in Coleridge's Ancyent Marinere, such society is based as much upon past human/ animal differ- ence and transgression, as it is upon present and future acts of human atonement. It is troubling "knowledge," but at the same time it is knowl- edge that serves to make Grasmere's beautiful vale a "community . . . / Of many into one incorporate": a social formation predicated upon the communion and "brotherhood" that troubled human and animal rela- tionships "once more" provide. For Wordsworth and Coleridge, and for other Romantic-period art- ists, human beings' relationships with animals are vitally social, and efficaciously vexed. "Love" for animals seems, as often as not in the above poems, to arise out of the gulf between humans and animals. In poems like Coleridge's "Nightingale" and Wordsworth's "Lines" we find speakers mindful of the marring effects of human cognition (and human action) upon animal otherness. We also find that community is repeatedly represented as a product of such difference and of its liter- ally or figuratively violent clashes with human perceptions and ac- tions. As Wordsworth's Home at Grasmere and Coleridge's Ancyent Marinere even more clearly reveal, animal otherness, more than hu- man and animal sameness (as Darwin proclaimed), is the principal foundation for community - community ever observing, belatedly, its difference from, and violence toward, the animals with which it iden- tifies. In Romantic-era representations, animals thus help to realize al- ternative forms of community founded not upon the vagaries of politi- cal revolution, reform, or even nationality, but upon ritual observance: a working-through of what remains deeply problematical in human beings' relationships with animals.</page><page sequence="16">" Sweet Influences": Wordsworth and Coleridge 15 In the later eighteenth century and early nineteenth century animals' "preeminent utility to mankind" (William Kirby, ca. 1835; cited Tho- mas 28) indeed was, for writers and painters, a social utility: a capacity to produce communities founded upon observance and the playing over "once more" of that which remains unsung or unmemorialized, even violent, in human beings' troubled relationships with nature's creatures. And while Wordsworth's and Coleridge's desire for such animal-derived community would appear to wane in subsequent years, owed in part no doubt to the poets' restored confidence in the institu- tions and religious orthodoxies they had previously questioned or con- demned, at the turn of the century their longing for new, alternative means of social cohesion was acute. Animals uniquely answered their call, as they did the calls of other artists, both for a broader notion of "brotherhood" and for "a transformative process" (Fulford 124) capable of constituting or renewing communitarian connections. We thus find even in Stubbs's portrait of Captain Pocklington that the foundational relationship of husband and wife is triangulated and emblematized by the horse, to which Mrs. Pocklington gives her hand and affections, and beside which the captain stands, legs mimetically poised like the animal's own. The structure of this Pocklington community is symbol- ized by the human figures' attention to this most valued of British ani- mals, without which, given Stubbs's arrangement, it almost seems there could be no proper marriage, or minimal community, at all. In this foregrounding of animals and of animal-oriented economies of various kinds, the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries ultimately represent something of a historical bubble in the cultural articulation of the human and the animal. At no time before or since have domestic and wild animals been so conspicuous within, and ar- guably central to, Western conceptions of human social interconnec- tion and subjectivity. But it was a time that passed. As Britain's social and political structures changed it would appear that animals were less needed in artists' social reimaginings.23 Animals thereupon receded into the pastoral backgrounds and rural memories from which they had come. As Lyle Rexer contends, in a recent article on animal pho- tography, the French Romantic painter Eugène Delacroix (1798-1863) "was, perhaps, the last great Western painter for whom animals really mattered" (one should add to the list his English contemporary, Edwin Landseer), but that, since the Romantic era, animals have been "in- creasingly absorbed into a corner of the public's consciousness" as trivial symbols "of times past and places elsewhere" (37). And yet, as Rexer also argues, even today on some level animal-oriented artists continue to seek "to 'make a connection,' to reforge a broken bond" (40). It may be, then, that representations of animals still retain, and</page><page sequence="17">16 ISLE will continue to retain, a certain cultural "utility," providing alterna- tive visions of community even for a post-Romantic age. NOTES 1. 1 am grateful for the helpful comments and questions earlier versions of this essay received from the seminar participants of Princeton's Shelby Cullom Davis Center for Historical Studies, in February of 1997, and from audiences at the inaugural conference on Literature and the Natural Environment, at the Univer- sity of Wales, Swansea, March 1997, and at the conference of the North American Society for the Study of Romanticism, at McMaster University, October 1997. 2. This is not to say that seventeenth-century painters, especially on the conti- nent, do not depict animals in their works. The Dutch artist Albert Cuyp (1620- 91) is but one example. Yet in both British and continental art such representa- tions of animals are nonetheless few before the advent of the Romantic era. 3. According to William Galperin, "The Haywain" depicts "a world uncon- trolled by human or authorial intervention" (87) and governed by what amounts to a different way of seeing (93). This other, animal's-eye vantage repeatedly attracts and blocks the human viewer's gaze, producing a "failure of absorp- tion" in the aesthetic experience (95). 4. As Tim Ingold explains, the question "What is an animal?" can be "con- strued in a number of ways, all of which are concerned with problems sur- rounding the definition of boundaries, whether between humans and non- human animals, animals and plants, or living and non-living" (1). 5. Keith Thomas observes that Linnaeus's Systema naturae (1735) "unabash- edly grouped Homo sapiens with other mammalian species and, more precisely, with other primates in the order Anthropomorpha. This may have encouraged the many students of that influential work to think more readily of man as an animal" and to view nature as a realm of evolving rather than static and fixed positions (7). Alex Potts adds that such new ideas about natural order were themselves tied to "changing conceptions of social order" (12). In fact such ideas were owed or linked not just to changing conceptual patterns but to the desires generated by social, economic, and conceptual changes. 6. Coleridge praised Erasmus Darwin early on as "the most inventive and philosophical of men. He thinks in a new train on all subjects except religion" (Collected Letters 1.99). Zoonomia, although not as popular as Darwin's poetical treatise The Loves of the Plants, was nonetheless sought out upon its publication by Wordsworth, some of whose poems in Lyrical Ballads, such as "Goody Blake, and Harry Gill," notably draw on Darwin. "Lines Written in Early Spring," with its "faith" in plants' and animals' pleasure, also likely draws upon Darwin's work (see Matlak 77-78). 7. A measure of this general shift in sensibility can be gauged by Lord Erskine's speech on behalf of his 1809 bill for the prevention of "Malicious and Wanton Cruelty to Animals." While Erskine acknowledges that humans may "enjoy" animals for food, pleasure, and curiosity, he argues for our benevolent treatment of our fellow creatures, as "[a]lmost every sense bestowed upon Man is equally bestowed upon them - Seeing - Hearing - Feeling - Thinking - the sense of pain and pleasure - the passions of love and anger - sensibility to kind-</page><page sequence="18">" Sweet Influences "-Ē Wordsworth and Coleridge 17 ness, and pangs from unkindness and neglect, are inseparable characteristics of their natures as much as of our own" (4). His view is noticeably close to Darwin's own. Happily for Erskine's cause, Adam Smith's Theory of Moral Sen- timents (1759) had pronounced "[t]he wise and virtuous man" to be "at all times willing" to sacrifice his selfish interest "to the interest of that great soci- ety of all sensible and intelligent beings" (346). Like Darwin's ideas about na- ture, Smith's sense of a greater "society" of "sensible . . . beings" offered con- ceptual opportunities to his contemporaries and successors for reimagining social relationships and identities. 8. "I see nothing to loathe in nature, Byron ambivalently observes in Canto 3 of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, "save to be / A link reluctant in a fleshly chain, / Class'd among creatures. . ." (724-27). 9. The nineteenth-century term "ecology" is, as Bate notes, comprised of the key Greek words logos and oikos : "system" and "dwelling." Coined in 1866 by the zoologist Ernst Haeckel to denote the "economy of nature" and "its friendly and inimical relations" of animals (cited Bate 36), ecology as a term succinctly captures the prior Romantic preoccupation with dwelling (ruins, bowers, cot- tages) and with whatever system makes such dwelling and social life possible. 10. Turner argues that even those who welcomed the forces of progress in England felt "a twinge qf uneasiness" and "a touch of longing for the familiar life fading away" (33) - as many of the works of the Romantic period attest. And, as Turner asks, "What was more 'natural' than beasts? Their paucity of reasoning power only enhanced their symbolic role as emblems of feeling. Moreover, since they exhibited many of the same emotions as people, they served as a very direct way of linking man with nature through the ties of feeling" (33). 11. Thomas's Man and the Natural World (1980) provides an informative history of these and other cultural influences upon the period's changing attitudes about animals (see 92-191). In contrast to Thomas's arguably more linear view of this history, Harriet Ritvo sees the Romantic- Victorian period as one of paradoxical attitudes and actions towards animals, suggesting both "change in human-ani- mal relations in Britain" as well as "stasis" ("Animals" 108). Indeed few even among those most concerned about animal welfare ever made a connection be- tween the meat they consumed and the animal suffering they deplored. For the upper classes in England meat continued to be a desired staple (Black 5-7). 12. John Berger argues that in fact animals have always (if less noticeably) been "central" to those cultural processes by which human beings "form an image of themselves" out of a system of differences (2) - and never more so, never more openly and even desperately so, I would add, than in the Roman- tic era in Britain. In "Eating Well" Jacques Derrida similarly describes subjec- tivity as the product of a "schema" of speculation and sacrifice, exchange and consumption (113). By this accounting, Western culture can be said to be at its core a shifting economy of physical and symbolical animal exchange - again, at no time more so in Britain than at the turn-of-the-century. 13. All citations from Coleridge's poetry follow the text of the poems in The Complete Poetical Works, excepting those poems by Coleridge included in his and Wordsworth's Lyrical Ballads. 14. For a helpful historical justification of Coleridge's and Southey's scheme,</page><page sequence="19">18 ISLE circa 1792-94, to escape to the banks of the Susquehanna, see Rosemary Ashton's Life of Samuel Taylor Coleridge (52). 15. In fact the poem's emphasis on "fellowship" created by sorrow and on the hardening effects of poverty and slavery also connects it to contemporary re- formist tenets and concerns, themselves associated with later anti-cruelty acts. 16. According to James McKusick's essay "Coleridge and the Economy of Nature," Coleridge's "unique contribution" to his collaboration with Wordsworth on Lyrical Ballads was in fact his "ecolinguistic" conception of language as "holistic" and organic - a view indebted to eighteenth-century natural history (392). 17. Kroeber similarly argues that the poem "warns that one distorts the truths of natural being when one projects into external nature [one's] narcis- sistic feelings" (73). 18. On the intertextual connections between Coleridge's poem - specifically its description of the water-snakes - and Erasmus Darwin's "The Economy of Vegetation" in his Linnaean-influenced Botanic Garden , see Ian Wylie, Young Coleridge and the Philosophers of Nature (154). Cf. Trevor H. Levere, Poetry Real- ized in Nature (11-13). 19. The similarity is striking between the moral of Coleridge's poem and the sentiments of Goody Two-Shoes : "These are GOD Almighty's creatures as well as we. He made both them and us ... so that they are our fellow Tenants of the Globe" (68). 20. See Raimonda Modiano, "Blood Sacrifice, Gift Economy, and the Edenie World: Wordsworth's 'Home at Grasmere'" (esp. 482-501). 21. See Walter Reed, "The Sacred, the Profane, and the Interest of the Secu- lar." Reed's analysis of works by Kafka and by Blake reveals how animals often lurk behind and inform religious ritual. 22. Perkins cites the standard commentary on this reference to a "milder day": as referring to "a future time when . . . 'all mankind' (1. 256) will share the 'blessedness' (1. 254) that the poet and his sister now know in Grasmere" (443). It is a reading Perkins finds problematical in its overly sympathetic view of humanity - a humanity shown in the poem to be prone to murderous hunt- ing (444-45). In fact the "intimation" the Wordsworths receive is primarily one of blessings for their own dwelling in the vale; only secondarily, by virtue of their "trust" (1. 255), do they perceive this "love and knowledge" as having the power to bring "blessedness . . . hereafter" to humankind. 23. Potts also argues that in this "important period of transition" the Enlightenment's and post-Enlightenment's "formalised conventions of [ani- mal] picturing" came increasingly to be seen as either "irrelevant or detrimen- tal to the cognitive content of a naturalistic visual depiction" (28). In short, both the order and ordering of things had changed. See also Ritvo, "New Pres- byter or Old Priest?" (272-74). REFERENCES Anonymous.
