<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Interactionism and the Child:  Cahill, Corsaro, and Denzin on  Childh ood Socialization  Gil Richard Musolf  Central Michigan University  Socialization is one of the defining concepts of symbolic interactionism. This  essay redirects attention to that area by reviewing the works of Spencer E.  Cahill, William A. Corsaro, and Norman K. Denzin, three scholars who have  had little attention paid to their work on childhood socialization. Under the  rubrics of (a) stages: automatic or contingent?, (b) play and games, (c) peer  groups and cultures, (d) gender identity, and (e) public behavior, it is argued  that these scholars have advanced symbolic interaction theory on childhood  socialization by featuring the constructive, communal, and collective aspects  of socialization. A summary of similarities and differences among these authors  is made, especially noting Corsaro’s conceptualization of “interpretive  reproduction. ” A critique focuses on some inadequacies in their work along  with suggestions for future research.  1 NTRO DU  CTI 0 N  Socialization was a foundational concept in sociology, but it has been less emphasized in  recent discussions of symbolic interactionism. From 1890 to 1934, the concept of social-  ization developed toward an interactionist perspective in the works of William James  (1890, 1892), James Mark Baldwin (1895, 1897, 1910), Charles Horton Cooley (1902,  1908, 1909), John Dewey (1906, 1922), and George Herbert Mead (1934).H erbert Blumer  (1937, p. 15) termed this perspective, “symbolic interaction.”  A number of questions emerge from the study of socialization: How do infants become  human through a socially grounded process from which emerges a self, mind, personality,  conscience, identity, and the ability to engage in social interaction? How do we become  like all other human beings, like some other human beings, and like no other human beings  (Kluckhohn and Murray 1948, p. 35)? How does culture become internalized (i.e., encul-  turation) and individuality emerge? Needless to say, this process presupposes the existence  of culture, which itself arises out of social interaction.

Yet, the symbolic interactionist paradigm did not come to fruition until Mead,  heavily influenced by James and Cooley, formulated a more elaborate theory of the self-as-  object. His theory emphasized that the self develops through the social and cognitive pro-  cesses of role-taking and language acquisition, and this proved to be a foundational per-  spective for American sociology. A framework for theorizing childhood socialization had  been established. A symbolic interactionist research agenda emerged with the publication  of John F. Markey’s ([1928] 1978) and W.I. Thomas and D.S. Thomas’s work (1928).  However, subsequent research primarily focused on adult socialization. Thus, until the  1970s, children and their social worlds were slighted in symbolic interactionist scholarship.  My focus is on the processes of socialization in early childhood and peer culture. Still,  this area is too vast and unwieldy to cover without further circumscribing this paper by lim-  iting my review to three notable scholars-Spencer E. Cahill, William A. Corsaro, and  Norman K. Denzin-who have had little critical attention paid to their work on childhood  socialization.*T here are other symbolic interactionists working in this field, but this essay  is directed to an in-depth exposition of a few scholars rather than an extensive review.  Denzin’s (197 1, 1972, 1977, 1979, 1982) dialectical conceptualization of the emergence  of self and mind is a comprehensive contribution from a symbolic interactionist perspec-  tive. Cahill’s (1980, 1983, 1986a, 1986b, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1994) research generates  insights into the self-acquisition and gender-identity process, utilizing the work of Mead,  Garfinkel, and Goffman. Corsaro draws not only on the seminal work of Cooley and Mead,  but also on the theories of Piaget, Vygotsky, Youniss, and, especially, Aaron Cicourel. In  various publications, Corsaro and his associates (Corsaro 1979a, 1979b, 1985, 1986, 1988,  1992; Corsaro and Eder 1990; Corsaro and Rizzo 1988, 1990) have examined the concept  of peer culture and its influence on the genesis of self, mind, and collective identity. Cor-  saro, who refers to his “interpretive theory of childhood socialization,” shares with Denzin  and Cahill the following similarities: a critique of the stage model of development, a strong  emphasis on the idea that children are active in their own socialization rather than just pas-  sive vessels internalizing an adult-given normative order, and the view that socialization is  a collective process (i.e., one entailing social interaction). Corsaro (1992), however, has  extended the symbolic interactionist perspective through his conceptualization of “inter-  pretive reproduction,” which will be explored in a later section devoted to differences.  My purpose is to review how these interactionists conceptualize socialization and the  emergence of peer culture during childhood-its period of maximum efficacy. A summary  of the Cooley-Mead heritage, from which most interactionist work on socialization  derives, launches the essay. The authors’ work shares thematic similarities which will be  organized under the following rubrics: (a) stages: automatic or contingent?, (b) play and  games, (c) peer groups and peer culture, (d) gender identity, and (e) public behavior. Clar-  ifying issues in the structure-agency dimensions of social life, these works are reconceptu-  alizing socialization theory by emphasizing its collective rather than individual aspects.  </page> <page sequence="3"> Interactionism and the Child 305  THE COOLEY-MEAD HERITAGE  Taking the attitude of the other, role-taking, is the process through which children are  socialized and develop selves. The mechanism of role-taking is language and, dialectically,  language acquisition is a product of socialization through imitation at first, and then taking  the role of the other.2 Language is learned beha~iorb,~ut  it is dependent on the size, form,  and structure of the human brain4 Interactionists regard language, both verbal and nonver-  bal, as a conversation of symbolic gestures. These gestures have, as their defining charac-  teristic, the ability to call out in a speaker and a listener shared understandings.  With names and labels (language), we are able to step outside of our selves as subjects  and see our selves as others do (reflexive role-taking)-that is, as objects. We become con-  scious of our selves (reflective self-consciousness) and separate our selves from others  (Lindesmith, Strauss, and Denzin 1988, p. 45). Additionally, we behave toward our selves  as objects: planning, initiating, controlling, and refraining from action. Other objects, and  our selves as objects, are not entities but symbols. Through the social conventions of lan-  guage, we do not passively receive, or directly “see,” objects, but actively constitute them  as objects-as-they-appear-to-us. Interacting with other objects and our selves as objects, as  symbolic representations, we engage in symbolic interaction. Without the acquisition of  language, one cannot view or act toward one’s self as an object. And until the self becomes  an object to itself through language, it cannot develop. Role-taking and language acquisi-  tion are inseparable, unquantifiable, and unprioritizable processes of self-objectification  and self-development.  Significant others are influential in this role-taking process; by internalizing their per-  spectives, the child socially constructs a self. Significanto thers are alooking-glass;t heir view  of us has much to do with how we view ourselves. Role-taking and language acquisition are  embedded in one’s relationship with significant others, peer groups, and the community at  large. They link the child to the family, other primary groups, and the world beyond. Thus,  the heart of socialization is interaction and negotiation. The ability of children to acquire lan-  guage and manipulate symbols endows those so socialized with the capacity for agency.  STAGES: AUTOMATIC OR CONTINGENT?  Denzin (challenging Piaget) and Cahill (challenging no one in particular) question the nat-  ural progression of developmental stages, even the one interactionists (following Mead)  advance-the sequence of the play and game stages. “The movement from one stage to  another is contingent on the development of sufficient language skills and on the presence  of interactive experiences” (Denzin 1977, p. 89). “[Nlowhere does Mead attach age speci-  fications” to the play and game sequence, and “implicit in [Mead’s] formulations is the  suggestion that some persons may never progress to the generalized other phase of taking  the other’s attitude” (Denzin 1977, p. 163). Cahill (1986a, p. 170) shares with Denzin the  view that “childhood socialization does not consist of empirically discrete, easily identifi-  able stages.” There is a “sequential pattern” to this process, and one can give names to the  elements of that process, but these names are merely “analytic constructs” (Cahill 1986a, p.  170). Corsaro (1985, p. 73) accepts aspects of Piaget’s model, yet he is critical of stages  </page> <page sequence="4"> 306 Symbolic Interaction Volume 19, Number 4, 1996  because of their linearity. Rather than discard stages, Corsaro’s (1985, p. 74) interpretive  model “extends the notion of stages by viewing development as a productive-reproductive  complex in which an increasing density and reorganization of knowledge marks progres-  sion.” This interpretive model, as did Cooley’s and Mead’s, attends to the importance of  language. “Central to the reproductive view is the belief that language provides a socio-  cognitive apparatus for the child and others to use. Language and discourse become the  most critical tool for the child’s construction of the social world” (Corsaro 1985, p. 74).  Self-development,d ependent on language acquisition, is thus problematic.  Denzin’s rejection of Piaget’s’ stage theory, which, to him, entailed biological deter-  minism, advances another differentiating tenet of symbolic interactionism: the age at  which the self dawns. Social behavior, which presupposes a self, emerges earlier than pre-  viously thought. Cooley tied social behavior to the use of personal pronouns, while All-  port linked it to understanding one’s personal name or identity (Denzin 1977, p. 92). But  Denzin’s (19 77, p. 96) ethnography on pre-school children establishes that “children are  social interactants far before the appearance of systematic pronoun usage, even before  names are fully understood.” The self is also adduced by “behaviors [that] go beyond ver-  bal declarations,” since much nonverbal behavior, also, is used “to communicate self’  (Denzin 1972, p. 309). Denzin (1977, p. 21) argues that “by the age of three children are  able systematically to take one another’s roles, present definitions of self, construct elabo-  rate games, and manipulate adults in desired directions.” The emergence of self and mind  is not determined by stages of growth, nor by attained age at which maturational processes  allegedly “take off.” Its course is shaped by environmental factors, the most significant of  which is the character of the processes of interaction involving the child. Yet, the distin-  guishing sign of selfhood is that the child “must be able to see himself as both object and  subject” (Denzin 1972, p. 306).  As noted above, Denzin observes that three-year-olds “are able” to engage in social  interaction and it is important to consider that phrase. A self and mind at the age of three are  problematic; stultifying environmental factors can vitiate the expression of agency. What is  critical for Denzin (1977, 1982) is not alleged stages of development tethered to chrono-  logical age, but interactional age and experience; thus, the pace and progress one makes  toward self-development and language acquisition is contingenL6 How fully the child’s  self, identity, personality, or conscience develop (i.e., whether they are marred or  enhanced) is contingent upon the social context of socialization. In short, context dispenses  interactional life-chances, which lead to “differential levels of reflexivity” (Denzin 1972,  p. 299). If children experience exceptional interaction, then the self emerges more rapidly  than previously understood in the role-takmg process characterizing interaction. Outstand-  ing interaction and differential reflexivity are evidenced by sophisticated language behav-  ior as well as the use of personal pronouns and personal names.  PLAY AND GAMES’  Play and games contribute fundamentally to the emergence of self and mind by cultivating  the ability to take the roles of others (Denzin 1977, p. 143). They function as forms of  </page> <page sequence="5"> lnteractionisrn and the Child 307  anticipatory socialization, through which children learn to interact with each other. Play  and games are similar in some respects, but they are different from each other in fundamen-  tal ways. Games constrain by rules, authority, space, and time; play promotes creativity.  Both furnish essential learning experiences that are required for adult life.  Games are forms of social interaction performed by one or more participants. They  familiarize children with rules, engender skill acquisition, and habituate them to competi-  tion and cooperation, as well as authority, goals, plans-of-action, and chance, all of which  significantly contribute to the unfolding of adult lives (Denzin 1977, p, 150). Children are  swiftly exposed to the fact that life is not fair. An awareness of inequality tinges conscious-  ness early, not only through variation in skill, but also through aleatory factors beyond  human control. The power of social constraints is imparted through the experience of being  assigned “undesirable roles” to play, through realization that winners and losers are virtu-  ally inevitable in any game, and through recognition that time, place, and circumstance  govern life-chances (Denzin 1977, p. 150). Games also involve pretense, bluffing, align-  ments, even rule-breakers and cheaters-all part of everyday adult life. Play is much less  structured than games, Pretense characterizes play; skill and chance are less requisite. All  of the authors emphasize that play promotes cooperation and creativity, through which  children actively construct their own social worlds. Corsaro’s project underscores play’s  shared, collective, and interactive features, maintaining that it is in peer play that children  develop a sense of social identity as children (Corsaro 1985, p. 66).  Cahill, expanding upon Goffman’s (1959) work, highlights how play helps children  learn to fashion their gender identities and appearance through the management of “per-  sonal fronts.” Since the anatomical basis for gender is concealed, typically sartorial dis-  plays and bodily adornment signify to the world one’s gender identity. Children conceive  of such items as hats and bows as signifying gender, ignoring anatomical features, even  when visible (Cahill 1989).  Cross-dressing is a process of learning appearance management and sex-appropriate  gender display. Adults scrutinize such behavior and direct their children to more suitable  sartorial symbols. Even peers criticize overwrought cross-gender exhibitions. Girls are  allowed more sartorial freedom, while boys whose attire smacks of femininity are ridi-  culed. This is the beginning of a long march through childhood, where boys dissociate  themselves from anything feminine, thereby contributing to the social reproduction of gen-  der and the sexist evaluation of women in adult life.  Sartorial requirements enhance and limit behavioral repertoires. Girls are instructed to be  careful about how they play because of how they are dressed. Gender-socialized behavior  (e.g., play) is then adduced as evidence of human nature, justifying the sexist treatment of  boys and girls.  One type of play is “spontaneous fantasy.” It involves “becoming” all types of creatures  (both people and animals) and the creation of social worlds “through [the child’s] manipu-  lation and animation of various play objects and materials” (Corsaro 1986, p. 91). Sponta-  neous fantasy is different from role-play proper. In this form of activity, children create  novelty by expanding on the inspirational behavior of peers, thereby providing an ever-spi-  raling social world of imagination and invention.  </page> <page sequence="6"> 308 Symbolic Interaction Volume 19, Number 4, 1996  Corsaro (1985, pp. 193-208; 1986, p. 91) has found that three tension-saturated themes  dominate this type of play: lost-found, danger-rescue, and death-rebirth. Through these  themes, play teaches serious lessons for adult life. These fantasies generate play during  which the skills of interpersonal behavior (e.g., cooperation, trust, gratitude, and coping  with anxiety) are sharpened. Two essential adaptive skills, the “control” of fear and the  ability to “communally share” this control with peers, is produced. Spontaneous fantasy  stimulates training in strategies for coping with the uncertainties, dilemmas, quandaries,  and exigencies of everyday life with responses such as contingencies, plans-of-action, nov-  elty, cooperation, and leadership. Children acquire these interactional skills through “com-  municative strategies,” or “discourse abilities,” such as turn-taking and topic selection,  thereby establishing group cohesion (Corsaro 1986, pp. 98-99). Thus, children’s construc-  tion of social worlds through spontaneous fantasy underscores how children, through lan-  guage, play an active role in their own socialization. And, dialectically, by participating in  spontaneous fantasy, children develop language skills (Corsaro and Rizzo 1988, p. 880).  Besides spontaneous fantasy, Corsaro’s (1985, pp. 219-250; 1988) comparative ethnog-  raphy of American and Italian nursery schools has led him to identify another common pat-  tern of play: approach-avoidance. The structure of the approach-avoidance routine  involves a “threatening agent” (monster) who is identified, approached, and avoided (Cor-  saro 1988, p. 5). Corsaro contends that in this routine, where threat is personified, children  are learning how to cope with fear by devising escape plans. Furthermore, he (1988, p. 9)  argues that, collectively, these routines generate communicative strategies that prepare the  child for the adult world. Two communicative skills that children learn are interpretation  and role-taking, whereby they “link specific signals or cues (voice intonation, facial  expression, avoidance behavior, etc.) to shared knowledge about monsters, mad scientists,  etc., to participate competently in the routine” (Corsaro 1985, p. 71). Children learn to con-  trol their environment so that they are not victims of it. Other lessons include the formation  of friendship and taking care of oneself without adult interference (i.e., independence).  Cahill, Corsaro, and Denzin realize that play is an adult term for children’s social inter-  action. It has the trivializing connotation that the interaction is not serious. Their respective  ethnographies enable them to assert that play is reflective work by children and requires a  self in order to be accomplished. In fact, play is children at work; it “involves such serious  matters as developing languages for communication, defining and processing deviance,  and constructing rules of entry and exit into emergent social groups” (Denzin 1977, p.  185). Thus, a child’s world is not totally derivative from the adult world; children construct  their own peer culture.  PEER GROUPS AND PEER CULTURE  The most significant public arena for children is the peer group, through which a peer cul-  ture is produced. Corsaro (1992, p. 162; 1988, p. 3) defines a peer culture as “a stable set of  activities or routines, artifacts, values, and concerns that children produce and share.” A  routine is an element of peer culture that is repetitive; it is a joint production, and it is pre-  dictable. Peer culture emerges through interaction in which children appropriate adult cul-  </page> <page sequence="7"> lnteractionisrn and the Child 309  ture but transform it so that it fits the situation at hand, as exemplified in a “garbage man”  routine that was even transmitted to the following year’s class (Corsaro 1985, pp. 250-  254). Appropriation and transformation are clearly adducible from “animal family” role-  play, whereby children, through shared knowledge of family role-play, adopt an external  culture and alter it to mesh with the context of the ongoing peer group (Corsaro 1985, pp.  105- 120). They reproduce representative family performances-such as the enactment of  power differentials-but recast them in order to produce recognizable, but imaginative  behavior (i.e., novelty). A cross-cultural example is provided by Corsaro and Rizzo’s  (1988) research on another adult cultural routine specific to Italian culture: the discussione.  Again, children appropriate adult culture and transform it so that the discussione is suitable  for the needs of a peer culture. A form of public debate emerges among three or more chil-  dren that involves making claims and counterclaims, stating beliefs, arguing, and disputing  the history of shared experience. Discussione consists of the dramatization of opposition,  where each child engages in a stylized ritual of providing “supporting evidence for one’s  positions within the debate” (Corsaro 1988, p. 886). The discussione is a verbal perfor-  mance that spawns sophisticated communication skills, solidarity, and friendship. Children  acquire social knowledge, interpersonal skills, and the ability to create social worlds  through this ritual of debate. Through cultural routines, children exemplify their ability to  role-take and role-make.  Corsaro’s (1985, p. 272) research has revealed two themes of peer culture: children’s  attempt to “gain control over their lives through the communal production and sharing of  social activities with peers.” Two major activities socially organize peer interaction: access  to social participation and protecting interactive space, and both of them are initiated by  children’s conceptions of friendship (Corsaro 1985, pp. 122-1 70). This parallels Denzin’s  (1977, p. 155) finding that “play is limited by the number of persons present and by the  relationships the players have with one another.” Access rituals allow children to gain entry  to ongoing play in a peer culture. Corsaro enumerates many strategies that children use to  enter and exit an interaction sequence. The most common feature of children’s access strat-  egies is that they are indirect and nonverbal, while adult access rituals tend to be direct and  verbal. Children may imitate the ongoing behavior, circle the interaction until invited to  participate, make reference to friendship, or just enter. Being defined as either a friend or  not is one basis for inclusion or exclusion-a way of protecting interactive space. As chil-  dren mature, they engage in more direct and verbal access strategies, such as greetings,  questioning participants, or just requesting access.  Gaining access is no easy affair; sometimes children have to employ several access strat-  egies before gaining entry to ongoing interaction. In the protection of interactive space,  children establish play areas and activities, thereby dissuading others from entering the  areas or engaging in the play. Children exclude others through five resistance strategies: no  justification given, reference to arbitrary rules, specific claims to ownership of objects or  play areas, justification based on space available or number of people already involved,  and denial of friendship (Corsaro 1985, pp. 128-131). Corsaro (1979a, p. 330) argues that  children protect interactive space because of its fragility. By studying the transition from  </page> <page sequence="8"> 310 Symbolic interaction Volume 19, Number 4, 1996  indirect to direct access strategies, one can discern the emergence of communicative com-  petence, especially the art of negotiation.  Corsaro’s (1979b, p. 53) research reveals how status8 is a ubiquitous aspect of peer cul-  ture, especially in “language use.” Children clearly “display knowledge of status as  power” (Corsaro 1979b, p. 57). Cross-status interaction between superordinate and subor-  dinate is typified by the superordinate’s use of imperatives. Subordinates use informative  statements, requests for permission to do something, and entreaties to engage in joint  action. Same-status interaction-among superordinates or subordinates-is characterized  by tag questions and requests for joint action. A tag question such as, “We’re playing  army, right?” is meant to confirm intersubjectivity or a shared definition of the situation.  Since children recognize status as power, higher-status interactants are able to maintain  control over the flow of interaction. They exert authority by giving orders, receiving def-  erence, and (here the research is only suggestive) inflicting “discipline scripts” (Corsaro  1985, pp. 77-100).  Deviance is also a part of peer cultures. Corsaro (1985, pp. 255-268; 1992, p. 173) draws  on Goffman’s (1961) concept of ‘‘secondary adjustments” to describe the ways children  actively resist adult rules and expectations-ways which constitute the underlife of the  nursery school. Secondary adjustments contribute to children’s sense of self, identity, and,  especially for Corsaro, their collective identity qua children vis-h-vis adults. Nursery  schoolers “worked the system” by resisting the rules concerning play areas and materials,  guns and shooting, bad language, and clean-up time. The social knowledge they gain  through resisting adult norms and organizations will help them with analogous aspects of  working the system as adults: office politics, climbing the corporate ladder, and the general  dissemblance of contemporary life.  By participating in peer culture, friendships are seasoned and interaction skills are  honed. Children develop “solidarity,” “mutual trust,” and ‘‘communal sharing.” Taking the  role of others cultivates children’s ability to share intersubjectivity and cooperate at joint  action, collective definitions of the situation, and the construction of common meanings  through which social worlds are built. Peer cultures are constituted in which children not  only reproduce, but also challenge and transform the world of adults so as to achieve self-  control and a measure of autonomy, two defining characteristics of agency. Communica-  tive competence or discourse ability (at turn-taking rules, access rituals, and role-playing)  are matured in peer cultures, where we find the child’s active contribution to his or her own  socialization (Corsaro 1986, p. 84).  GENDER IDENTITY  Through taking the role of the generalized other, a child learns the rules of public conduct  and acquires skill in applying those rules in everyday interaction (Chill  1986a, p. 164).  Social control must be largely self-control in a democratic society that promotes civility,  liberty, and freedom. Cahill’s research sets out to answer the question of how one acquires  self-regulation by emphasizing the emergence of gender identity, a fundamental aspect of  self and society.  </page> <page sequence="9"> lnteractionisrn and the Child 31 1  One learns to act, think, and feel either as a male or female. Gender development is a pro-  cess of recruitment into a gender identity. External genitalia, of course, do not provide the  cultural equipment necessary so that one is recognized as masculine or feminine; such rec-  ognition involves a process of social construction. Consequently, interactionists reject  essentialism, the idea that gender identity is biologically determined, in favor of the theory  that identity is socially anchored (Cahill 1980, p. 125; 1983, p. 2).  Caretakers, especially those connected with schools, recruit children into gender identi-  ties so that they internalize gender ideals and exhibit a range of competence at displaying  those ideals in everyday behavior (Denzin 1971, p. 67). Self-regulation through gender  socialization means a more or less loose conformity to gender ideals and rules of conduct  which display masculinity or femininity (Cahill 1986a, p. 166).  Cahill uses five analytical constructs to depict gender identity formation: acquiescent  participation, unwitting participation, exploratory participation, apprentice participation,  and bona-fide participation. Gender-recruitment begins during acquiescent participation,  wherein people respond in socially prescribed ways to infants (investing them with mascu-  line or feminine characteristics) even though, physically, newborn males and females are  nearly identical (Cahill 1980, 1983, 1986a). These differential responses constitute acqui-  escent identity construction. The infant is encouraged to identify either as male or female.  Others act as its looking-glass, and as they respond to it, so does it respond to itself (Cahill  1980, p. 128).  Gender identity is constructed as others reproduce sexually differentiated behavior by  reinforcing interaction that is in keeping with gender ideals. The social construction of gen-  der continues as children respond to others’ expectations in a process of unwitting partici-  pation-a process that centers on children’s active, but unaware, participation in  fashioning gender.  In Cahill’s third construct, exploratory participation, children refine their ability to self-  regulate as they label themselves, explore and affirm identities, and try to support their  claims with appropriate behavior. During this experience, children become actively self-  conscious agents. Cahill (1983, p. 5 ) ,  suggests, following Denzin, that the self-labeling  process now becomes important in the ripening of gender identity. The child reacts to his or  her self as others would by trying to “confirm” or “ratify” the identity of male or female.  Gender confirmation dwells in others’ responses. If the child elicits gender-appropriate  reactions, then he or she is treated as a boy or girl; gender identity is established. In order  to elicit the confirming responses, the child models same-sex others from a variety of ref-  erents, such as TV, movies, stories, and parents (Cahill 1980, 1983, 1986a); however, in  this media era, parents may be less influential as significant others (Cahill 1983, pp. 8-9).  Claims and behavior are not always supported by others. This teaches children that they  should be circumspect with their identity avowals and behavior. In other words, the label-  ing of behaviors as gender-appropriate is a matter of social control and the social reproduc-  tion of gender (Cahill 1983, pp. 10-11; 1986b, p. 304; 1989). Children must behave as  others expect them to; otherwise, they may not have their gender identities ratified. What  the child considers appropriate will depend on the cues and expectations she or he has  learned from the adults, peers, and general culture in her or his social world. During this  </page> <page sequence="10"> 312 Symbolic Interaction Volume 19, Number 4, 1996  period of interaction, the most important affirmation is one of “big boy” or “big girl,” since  the child tends to want to discard the label of “baby,” a despised identity (Cahill 1986b, p.  302). As a result of labeling by others, as well as self-labeling, there is a strong relationship  “between language practices and gender identity acquisition” (Cahill 1986b, p. 297).  During apprentice participation, which corresponds to our everyday notion of preadoles-  cence, children interact in same-sex peer groups and maintain “gender segregation bound-  aries” (Cahill 1994, p. 464). Their commitment to behavioral displays of masculinity or  femininity become subtle, sophisticated, and solid.  Bona-fide participation refers to interaction that is usually, though not necessarily, coter-  minous with the biological changes at puberty. Children perfect their competency at social  skills, especially at what Cahill (1986a, p. 179) refers to as “heterosocial skill” (which is  displayed by such activities as dating).  In large measure, children learn to become self-regulating participants in society by dis-  playing masculine and feminine behavior, thereby conforming to the gender ideals of soci-  ety and claiming a gender identity. Gender-segregation behaviors are rehearsed in  childhood and performed in adulthood (Cahill 1994, p. 467). Yet, both structure and  agency are clearly visible as each generation modifies gender ideals, for example, through  innovative sartorial expressions. Today, some men wear earrings while some women wear  suits; however, a man wearing make-up and a dress would be deviant in any corporation.  PUBLIC BEHAVIOR  Cahill(l987, 1990) and Denzin (197 1) also have emphasized the arduous task of socializ-  ing children to the normative expectations of behavior in public places. Drawing on the  work of Durkheim and Goffman, Cahill describes the rituals necessary to constitute and  maintain civil society. Parents or caretakers must instruct children in public etiquette and  the ceremonies necessary to maintain a moral order. Children are not considered morally  responsible people; therefore, they must be accompanied, while in public, by an adult who  is held morally liable. Takmg children to public places is a socializing experience (and  often a harrowing one) for both the adult and child. The child must be taught the rules of  public behavior. Since these rules are “unspoken,” the child can learn only through a  hands-on experience, such as by practicing public behavior under the tutelage of a care-  taker and observing how others in the situation behave. If the child does not conform to the  normative expectations of public etiquette, then the caretaker must discipline the child  since others stand ready to reaffirm society’s expectations if the caretaker is found to be  incapable of doing so. Any irresponsibility on the caretaker’s part will elicit negative sanc-  tions from the surrounding adults as well as the label associated with a negative moral iden-  tity. A child who misbehaves shapes the moral identity of the parent or caretaker; the  young child is excused, though older children also are held morally accountable. Thus,  children are not allowed to participate freely in public life, but are under constant scrutiny  so that they do not disrupt it. Until a child can behave in public-signifying that he or she  has internalized the moral order-the child will be held captive by his or her parents.  </page> <page sequence="11"> Interactionism and the Child 31 3  Allowing one’s child to gambol in public expresses faith that one’s child is bridled by the  normative order against untoward acts.  SIM IL ARlTl ES  All three scholars celebrate the fact that socialization is not a “structurally determined pro-  cess whereby the valoes and goals of social systems are instilled in the child’s behavior  repertoires” (Denzin 1977, pp. 2-3). This emphasis does not deny that, to some extent, chil-  dren are cultural, social, historical, political, and economic products (Denzin 1977, pp. 15-  27). These theorists acknowledge that social structure circumscribes human agency, but  they argue that structural constraints are not deterministic. The tension between these two  aspects of socialization is explored in the following section.  Socialization reproduces gender ideals, boundaries, and behavior, just as it reproduces  the “natural and moral order” of society (Cahill 1986a, p. 181). One can draw the inference  that injustice is embedded in gender socialization: it obstructs women’s achievement by  restricting access to many areas of life, a restraint justified by ideologies which miscon-  strue gender as a biological construct. Cahill’s work shows us how adults forget that  children and adults co-author gender, thus empowering it over us. Implicitly, Cahill paral-  lels Marx: we make religion but lose sight of our creation, thereby engendering a process of  alienation. The theme of reification is implied in that theorizing gender as nature or hered-  ity induces neglect of the fact that what is humanly constructed can be undone or  transcended.  Injustice also can be inferred from Denzin’s (197 1, pp. 68-69) work on the cooling-out  function of schools. Socializing lower-class children for failure through reflected apprais-  als so that the students’ self-image is one of incompetence, schools reproduce negative  moral identities along with stratification. With the ideology of meritocracy internalized,  children schooled to failure blame themselves for current problems and a dismal future.  Schools are not the only organizations that govern language acquisition, self-develop-  ment, and minded behavior. Denzin (1977, p. 128) noted that “a child’s speech repertoire  reflects the character of her larger speech community.” Children deprived of adequate  interaction, in this case socialization within a suitable speech community, suffer a dimin-  ished capacity for language acquisition and self-development. Interaction at home, in a  peer group, and at school can be salubrious or detrimental, emancipating or stunting. The  caliber of such interaction is the primary factor contributing to the content of socialization  and the pace of self-development. Caretakers can either enhance or shatter a child’s self-  esteem. Likewise, schools can take capacities and either cultivate them into abilities or har-  row them into deficiencies. These contingencies help to explain the differential pace of self  and mind formation, as well as the impairment, or even absence, of such abilities. Thus, the  child’s world is profoundly unjust; though capable of agency, children cannot choose the  quality of their speech communities nor the circumstances from which their selves emerge.  Since the ability to acquire language and manipulate symbols is requisite for the emergence  of the self, minded behavior, and social interaction, it follows that cultural capital, reflected  </page> <page sequence="12"> 314 Symbolic Interaction Volume 19, Number 4, 1996  in one’s speech repertoire, legitimates and reproduces power and inequality in a  meritocracy.  Cahill’s work implies additional injustices. Adults do not have to observe the same ritu-  als of public etiquette toward children that children are expected to observe toward adults.  Children may be stared at and spoken to; they may. have their public space invaded, and  they may be discussed and commented on by surrounding adults. More often than not, they  are treated as nonpersons. The ceremonial order is a mortifying one for children-one  unintentionally designed to promote deviance. Children resist an unjust order when they  “are not expected to do unto others what is done unto them, but what others instruct and  encourage them to do” (Cahill 1987, pp. 318-319).  These authors emphasize that socialization is an active process, accomplished through  taking the attitude of others. While significant others are influential, due to their function as  the child’s first looking-glass, children contribute to the social construction of their own  worlds. Witness their participation in the formation of peer cultures through which they  transform what-is-at-hand into castles, spaceships, alien worlds-into make-believe social  worlds where monsters lurk and heroes save the day. Climbing-bars can be defined as a  prison, a burning house, a restaurant, a circus, a home, or a den (Corsaro 1985, p. 184). This  is the most fundamental example of bricolage. Like some South-American writers, chil-  dren create a world of magical realism; their play and peer culture are full of personifica-  tion, anthropomorphism, zoomorphism, and animism; it is a world of the sacred and the  profane.  Corsaro and Denzin focus on play and games that teach children numerous interactional  strategies. These strategies cultivate their communication competence as well as develop  their selves, minded behavior, and gender identity. Play and games anticipatorily socialize  children into hierarchy, rules, chance, competition and cooperation, intersubjectivity and  community, and the fact that life is not always fair.  DIFFERENCES  Denzin and Cahill subscribe solely to the interactionist, or constructionist, approach. Cor-  saro (1992) has extended this paradigm; he regards “interpretive reproduction” as his sig-  nal advance over constructionism. It underscores that children act on their environment and  participate in social worlds where they socialize each other; it stresses that children attempt  to gain control over their world by communally appropriating, resisting, and reproducing  the adult world, rather than simply imitating adult culture. Corsaro emphasizes children’s  transformative power through their appropriation of adult culture, creatively interpreted  and reproduced within peer culture. He also highlights children’s culture-making that is  nonderivative from adults. In contrast, Cahill’s work on children’s gender identity and pub-  lic behavior and Denzin’s work on speech communities emphasize the environmental,  internalization, and social reproduction aspects of socialization. The socialization process  entails a tension between continuity and change. Acquiring competence as a social actor  involves a dialectic between the role-taking (reproductive/thesis) and role-making (produc-  tivehtithesis) qualities of the self (synthesis). Symbolic interactionism has always con-  </page> <page sequence="13"> Interactionism and the Child 31 5  ceptualized this dialectic as an intergenerational process. What Corsaro’s project  underscores is that becoming a social actor is also a process of intrugenerational routines in  a progression of peer cultures. Both orientations acknowledge the interplay of structure and  agency in the making of selves.  Corsaro’s expansion (1992, pp. 165, 168) was influenced by Giddens’s (1984) work on  structuration and Goffman’s (1974) notion of “keying,” a process in which meaningful  activity from a primary framework-say, adult culture-is reframed and transformed into  something else within peer culture. Corsaro’s (1992, p. 169) research illuminates the point  that socialization is creative as well as reproductive, thereby accentuating the agentic, role-  making, and problematic aspects of everyday life-the foundations for emergence and  novelty. Children transform culture even as they are socialized by it.  Thus, Corsaro is reconceptualizing childhood socialization. To some extent, children  make themselves through their own institution of peer culture. This connects his work to  that of Marjorie Harness Goodwin (1990, p. 308) and Barrie Thome (1993, p. 176), who  argue that socialization theory has privileged internalization and viewed children as those  “who are acted upon more than acting” (Thorne 1993, p. 3). Goodwin’s (1990, p. 283) eth-  nography has shown that children not only shape themselves, but also shape others through  peer interaction. Thorne argues that for too long socialization has conveyed the idea that  adults are active while children are passive. Children are not just learners; they are more  than passive, incomplete, or incompetent adults; they are makers of fashion, gender, social  identity, and selves. “There is much to be gained by seeing children not as the next gener-  ation’s adults, but as social actors in a range of institutions . . . . Children’s interactions are  not preparation for life; they are life itself’ (Thome 1993, p. 3).  While Denzin is critical of Piaget’s stage model, Corsaro elaborates on it. According to  Denzin, that model is nondialectical; it fails to take into account the macrostructural envi-  ronment and the microstructural influences on the pace, or even eventual appearance, of  self and mind. Thus, Denzin believes that minded behavior and self-formation via interac-  tion must be probabilistically and indeterminately conceptualized.  Corsaro’s work is set apart by his endorsement of equilibrium (Piaget’s concept) as the  motivation that propels children along the developmental hierarchy. As children develop,  how do they make themselves? Like Piaget, Corsaro (1985, p. 280) argues that “learning  should be viewed as a process of compensation resulting from children’s continual  attempts to deal with problems, confusions, and ambiguities in their life worlds.” Encoun-  tering various intrusions, children seek equilibrium-maintaining activities within “a series  of peer cultures,” which propel them to cognitive advancement and adulthood (Corsaro  1985, p. 281; 1992, p. 171). Denzin and Gerald Handel see interactional experience as  something much broader than a series of peer cultures, which warrants a further critique.  CRITIQUE  Handel (19 90) has criticized Corsaro and Rizzo’s work on peer cultures, arguing that they  tend to minimize other sources of childhood socialization, particularly adults and the f a -   ily. Handel (1990, p. 463) contends that a reader may come away with the notion that, to  </page> <page sequence="14"> 31 6 Symbolic Interaction Volume 19, Number 4, 1996  understand childhood socialization, one focuses only on peer cultures, analyzing the “lan-  guage that children use when interacting with age-mates.’’ According to Handel, Corsaro  and Rizzo construct an argument based on four polarities in which one side is privileged. In  the first polarity, sociologists versus developmental psychologists, Handel criticizes the  ambiguity in the authors’ work for not specifying the importance of internalization. The  second polarity, collective versus private, concerns the fact that collective processes of  socialization are privileged over the p r i ~ a t eW.~h at about private play or the way children  construct playthings on their own? The child versus adult is the third polarity. Here, Handel  calls for balanced treatment of the effects that children have on adults and the effects that  adults have on children. The fourth polarity, peer group versus family, can be used to cri-  tique not only Corsaro’s work, but also that of Denzin and Cahill. Where is the family in  the childhood socialization process? Corsaro’s claim that cultural routines originate in peer  groups may be misleading if there is no prior study of the family. Handel’s observation that  children learn their first cultural routines in the home is sensible and points to a misleading  gloss in Corsaro’s methods. A comparative method should assess whether peer play  expresses routines arising from family life or the peer group.  Social structure is not adequately researched in peer play and friendship formation.  Goodwin’s (1990, p. 49) ethnography of a peer group of working-class black children and  the social organizational features of their talk-in stories, gossip, and argument-shows  that, in the absence of structural constraints or directives from caretakers, girls and boys  spontaneously talk to and play with one another. Goodwin’s peer group consisted of an  unfocused gathering in which gender asymmetry was generally absent. She found that  many activities promote equality and solidarity (Goodwin 1990, pp. 284-285); neverthe-  less, children segregate when conflict arises over what is defined as exclusively girls’ or  boys’ play. Eder and Hallinan (1978) observed that girls’ dyadic friendships were more  exclusive than boys’ (i.e., girls rejected newcomers more frequently). Boys’ play tends to  require a larger number of participants, which helps to explain their orientation toward  nonexclusivity. However, teachers may reinforce gender separateness through notions of  what is appropriate play for girls and boys. Furthermore, children who are already cogni-  zant of gender ideals may self-select gender-typed play (Eder and Hallinan 1978, p. 238).  When the structure of the situation was an open classroom, boys and girls interacted  together more often. Thus, context (interaction other than play) and structure (the open  classroom) are factors that must be taken into account (Eder and Hallinan 1978, p. 247).  Different types of play may lead to differentially valorized social skills. If males acquire  group-leadership skills while females acquire skills at self-disclosure, then their play is  socially reproducing gender inequality (Eder and Hallinan 1978, p. 247). This theme is fur-  ther amplified by Eder and Parker (1987, p. 209) in their study of the effects of extracumc-  ular activities: sports socialize males to competitiveness, achievement, and aggressiveness,  while cheerleading socializes females to the importance of attractiveness, glamour, and  emotion management.  Additional attention to the structural dimensions of conflict is needed. Thome (1993, p.  16 1) notes that teachers structure conflict into academics, which “ratified the gender divide  by pitting boys against girls in math and spelling contests.” This “hamess[es] gender  </page> <page sequence="15"> Interactionism and the Child 31 7  rivalry as a motivation for learning,” debases competition into “hostility,” and reproduces  “polarization” by associating gender with opposition, antagonism, and conquest. Class-  rooms, the cafeteria, and playgrounds have “gendered turfs,” which create two distinct  social worlds wherein teachers “police gender boundaries” and aides “shooed children”  away from places they thought exclusively girls’ or boys’ territory (Thorne 1989, pp. 74-  76). Thus, Thome’s (1993, p. 161) ethnography reveals how gender-segregated academic  contests and play, structured by teachers and school aides, “perpetuates an image of dichot-  omous difference” and “encourages psychological splitting.” These findings corroborate  Cahill’s insights. School practices that divide boys and girls institutionalize gender strug-  gle. Extrapolating from how girls and boys are differentially directed (Cahill 1983, 1986a,  1986b, 1989; Eder and Hallinan 1978; Eder and Parker 1987), we come to understand how  a gendered opportunity structure arises which reproduces inequality across generations  (power, education, occupation, and income).  Future research should be directed at two arguments currently permeating public debate:  (a) the declining effect of parents on children (the decline in family values argument) and  (b) the increasing effect of media on children (or, to highlight agency, how children define  media representations). Corsaro’s (1985, p. 61) argument that “children are. . . continually  exposed to the adult world by the media (especially television),” grows in gravity since  “children’s initial exposure to media events and consumer goods in the family is often  intensified in peer culture” (Corsaro 1992, p. 172).  Another underexplored topic is the role of schools in the socialization process. Aside  from nursery school, Denzin, Cahill, and Corsaro have little to say about schools as agents  of socialization. Thome’s (1989, 1993) account of gender play and Eder and Parker’s  (1987) study of extracurricular activities demonstrate that schools wield important influ-  ence over socialization.  CONCLUSION  All three authors have theorized dialectical accounts of their research: Cahill on recruit-  ment to gender identity, Corsaro on the productive and reproductive aspects of peer-culture  routines, and Denzin on the influence of interaction and language acquisition for self-  development. They have shown that children, in their appropriation and transformation of  adult culture, construct selves, gender, social identities, and peer cultures. No longer play-  ing bit parts on the proscenium, children now appear center stage in that collective rather  than individual, sociological rather than psychological, drama known as socialization. The  inspirational work of Denzin, Cahill, and Corsaro provides a powerful platform for the  continued study of childhood socialization, and it represents a significant advance in sym-  bolic interactionist theory.

Whether Corsaro considers himself an interactionist is unclear; however, his approach is compat-  ible with symbolic interactionism.  2. I thank an anonymous reviewer for reminding me not to gloss over this dialectical relationship.  3. The definition of language is one source of differences between developmentalists and symbolic  interactionists. The latter do not define language as solely adult speech. Denzin (1977, p. 95), fol-  lowing Blumer, defines language as a set of “significant indicative gestures.” The meaning of  gestures arises out of the interaction process itself. Children engage in significant indicative ges-  tures long before they master articulate speech.  4. Again, I thank an anonymous reviewer for reminding me of this point.  5 .  In 1977, Denzin presented a highly controversial interpretation of both Chomsky and Piaget,  charging them with biological determinism. At issue, according to Denzin, is Piaget’s argument  for the “invariant character” of “specific ages for cognitive development” (Denzin 1977, p. 119).  Denzin contends that the rate of self-development is contingent upon interactional experiences,  nurturance by significant others, and environmental features. Children are either blessed or  impaired by the world into which they are born. According to Denzin, Piaget views children  under the age of seven as egocentric-unable to take the attitude of the other-and therefore  inept in social behavior, Denzin’s observation of play and games convinced him that Piaget’s  argument on the age of the appearance of the self and social behavior is erroneous. Piaget main-  tains that games with rules rarely appear before the age of seven. Denzin (1977, pp. 117 and 162)  submits that this “clearly prejudges the cognitive and interactive skills of the young child,” and  that Piaget’s model “is irrevocably embedded in a biological image of cognitive development.”  Corsaro (1985, p. 54) believes that Denzin has misread Piaget, underscoring that it is equilibrium  or equilibration that is “the central force which propels children through the stages of cognitive  development.” According to Corsaro, Piaget’s model is “probabilistic” and concerned with how  children compensate with activities when confronted with external intrusions. In fact, Piaget’s  equilibration model is interactive and, therefore, “should not be seen as a form of biological  determinism” (Corsaro 1985, p. 54). Denzin (1977, p. 77) also disputed Chomsky’s claim that  there is deep, innate knowledge that shapes the language-acquisition process. According to Den-  zin, transformationalists (those adhering to Chomsky’s principles of transformational grammar)  maintain that a cognitive structure in the brain provides humans with a Language Acquisition  Device (LAD). Denzin argued that learning disappears in this hypothesis, since the LAD is  alleged to be an inherent structure that impels children to acquire language. But Denzin’s views  have apparently changed in regard to both Chomsky and Piaget. This is evident in the following  statement where Denzin and his coauthors comment on the work of E.O. Wilson: “Wilson notes  that prominent social scientists such as Chomsky, Piaget, and Kohlberg have theories of lan-  guage, cognitive development, and moral development, respectively, that are consistent with  sociobiology in that they posit an innate, genetic underpinning to child development. Children,  they contend, go through certain stages in their development because they are genetically predis-  posed to do so. We regard this as a careless misreading of Chomsky, Piaget, and Kohlberg”  (Lindesmith, Strauss, and Denzin 1988, pp. 3 1-32).  6. In a statement derived from Sullivan (19531, Denzin (1972, p. 307) offers the following hypoth-  esis, which is still a potential goldmine for research: “It would be predicted that the more com-  plex the interactional world of the child is, the more rapid would be the genesis of self, and the  closer in time would be the self and other differentiation.” Rose Laub Coser (1991, p. 85) agrees:  “Where social relationships are complex-that is, where we have different things in common  with people occupying different positions-we are challenged to develop more complex mental  abilities.” Basil B. Bernstein’s (1971) research on speech communities is also relevant, espe-  cially his concepts of elaborated and restricted codes in language socialization and their role in  </page> <page sequence="17"> Interactionism and the Child 31 9  the social reproduction of class. See also William Labov (1967) on class stratification and  English usage.  I am not referring to Mead’s notion of the play and game stages. Mead was referring to two  stages of development tied to different role-taking activities. In these stages the self and mind  emerge. In the play stage, one can take the role of significant others, but only one at a time. In the  game stage, one can take the roles of several others simultaneously. Ultimately, of course, the  self and mind have fully emerged when one can take the role of the generalized other, that is, the  abstract perspective of a group or society. In contrast, Cahill, Corsaro, and Denzin are merely  referring to children at play and playing games.  During adolescence, other differentiations arise within peer cultures (Corsaro and Eder 1990, pp.  208-213). Friendship takes on more seriousness and diversity occurs along attitudinal lines, so  that peer groups now have more within-group similarity than those of early childhood. In addi-  tion, class distinctions arise, with middle-class peer groups based on interests and working-class  peer groups based on loyalty. Gender markers and conflict escalate. Among male adolescents,  language activities such as “ritual insulting,” “teasing rituals,” “storytelling,” and “gossip” inten-  sify group solidarity and the formation of shared definitions of the situation. These language  practices establish domination, and parallels can be drawn to Foucault’s (1967) notion of dis-  course formation.  Corsaro (1992, p. 160) states “I found myself studying collective, communal, and cultural pro-  cesses.’’ His (1985, p. 122) ethnography did not provide the opportunity to study solitary play:  “children who found themselves alone consistently attempted to gain entry into one of the ongo-  ing peer episodes.”  REFERENCES  Baldwin, James Mark. 1895.
