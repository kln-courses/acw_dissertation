Europe and are clearly associated with the social transformations characterizing Europe in this period. While the varying traditions of stelae, from the Ukraine to Iberia, differ considerably, they also share a set of general aesthetic choices towards representing the human body, reducing the body to a rigidly schematic, highly stylized with a widely shared geometry and with emphasis upon its surface as a canvas for social marking, particularly of gender. This paper reviews the aesthetic choices involved in stelae and relates them to the changing social contexts of later prehistoric Europe. Keywords Art • Anthropomorphic stelae • Copper age • Personhood • Aesthetics • Body Aesthetics and the Body? This paper began as an odd experiment some years ago when I idly tried to devise a generative grammar (Chippindale 1992) for human figurines and statues in prehistoric Europe (Fig. 1; Table I). Surprisingly, this project worked like clockwork for some bodies of material, particularly rigidly schematic, almost standardized ones such as the stelae discussed here; it quickly hit a brick wall with others, for instance with Central Mediterranean figurines which represent the body in ways which are immensely variable and fluid and in fact seem barely rule-governed in any discernable way. Why should human representations differ so greatly in their aesthetic characteristics? Why should the human figure be depicted according to widely shared aesthetic rules in some periods and not in others? Given the great differences in social context within which Neolithic, Copper Age, and Bronze Age human body representations are found, such variation in how the body is represented J.

This paper thus addresses an important, and surprisingly neglected, problem in the study of ancient human representations. What is the relationship between how the body is represented - its style or aesthetic qualities - and its social world? It is striking how, with a few outstanding exceptions (Joyce 2005; Meskell and Joyce 2003), the recent "archaeology of the body" has so rarely discussed human representations. In part, this may be due simply to archaeological chance: for instance, there are few human representations known in the archaeology of the Western European Neolithic and Bronze Age, a field within which much key theory has been developed. Yet this would not explain why there have been few body-oriented theorizations of human figurines for the Balkan Neolithic, a period which has attracted the attention of some quite eminent theorists (Bailey 2005; Nanoglou 2005; Nanoglou 2008). Another reason may lie in the theoretical sources upon which archaeologists have drawn. By and large, the various canons of theory we have used, from phenomenology to practice theory, feminism, and Foucauldian analysis of cultural discourses, have been concerned with the "real" body - the lived, experienced, body - rather than with representations of it. Gender archaeologists, for instance, have done surprisingly little with representations, as opposed to burials, ^ Springer</page><page sequence="3">164 Robb Table I Stela Traditions in European Prehistory Area Characteristics References "Pontic Group" Numerous.

Similarly, studies of embodiment have tended to focus on the body as the bridge between the internal and external worlds, particularly via sensory experience, self-understanding, self- presentation, and memory (Hamilakis et al. 2002). When body representations have been studied explicitly in body theory, it has tended to be in fields less obviously generalizable to ancient situations, for instance, the commodification of the female body via imagery or the self-fashioning of the body in consumer culture. Where the aesthetic style of representation has been addressed in archaeology, it has most often been done in art historically, in ways which are atheoretical (as in many specialist studies of prehistoric "art") or difficult to relate to anthropological work because of disciplinary orientations (as in art historical discussions of the meanings of Classical "naturalism"). fi Springer</page><page sequence="5">166 Robb Yet the potential exists for forging a bridge between the representation of the body and the body's agency, and the theoretical footwork needed is not overly complex. The principle of objectification (Miller 2005) provides a starting point: the process of human action upon material things also produces persona and externalized culture, which then can act as autonomous, external forces shaping further human understandings, choices and actions. Given this, it is obvious that the body is both produced by human actions (for instance, nourishing, clothing, training, categorizing, recognizing, and many others) and forms the vehicle for action. It thus affords a paradigmatic example of objectification, of culture made flesh and understood and experienced as such. Material representations, in this view, provide a meta-order of objectifications which abstract a given understanding of the body and person, and present it to self and world as a. fait accompli, as a regulatory ideal in Foucault's terminology. Hence, the link between the body as experienced and lived and the body as represented is via more general concepts which link thought and action. Such concepts and their form of instantiation will never be unique, to the absolute exclusion of alternatives, nor will they be context-free. But even though contexts such as pre-existing power relations are without doubt important, concepts of the body cannot simply be regarded merely as superficial calls to bring the body in line with pre-existing power relations; the ideas they represent are important ones. In a clear example of self-objectification, some Mesoamerican figurines served a didactic role in instilling ideals of what it meant to belong to a given gender (Joyce 2000; Meskell and Joyce 2003). Similarly, the human body in Breton megalithic art provided a generative, polysemic metaphor (Thomas and Tilley 1993), and in Bronze and Iron Age burials and bodily practices, the fashioning and transformation of the body itself merged with representations of it (Treherne 1995). In an example particularly relevant to this paper, the contrast between wood and stone in the British Neolithic may have summarized key differences between living bodies and the bodies of ancestors (Parker Pearson and Ramilsonina 1998). Whether or not such examples are accepted within their own fields - and any truly interesting interpretation will raise controversy - they suggest some points for an approach to the question raised above. "Art" is regarded as a specialized technology for achieving specific effects (Gell 1998); the style in which representation is carried out can be a key element in achieving specific effects (an argument typified by Gell's (1992) discussion of technologies of enchantment). By aesthetics, I mean conformity to a canon of expectations which governs how representation is carried out. While our focus is often upon the object of representation, it is clear that the aesthetics of representation often encodes equally important social meanings. For instance, Victorian Gothic and Modernist public buildings both served to house functions such as school, offices, and factories, but they enshrined completely different ideals in the architectural canons they employed, with contrasting claims to ancient and elaborate hierarchy and to streamlined, accelerating efficiency. In sum, the materiality of the body involves an understanding of it which is established relative to a particular social context, and this materiality is an important element in the process of self-objectification. Such an understanding can be communicated as much, or more, from the canon of aesthetic choices used to represent fi Springer</page><page sequence="6">People of Stone: Stelae, Personhood, and Society 167 the body as from the body itself. The style or aesthetic qualities of representation are a key means of making statements about the nature of the body and person. Using prehistoric European stelae as an example, I will argue that the aesthetics of body representation can be a powerful vector of self-understanding or self-fashioning. Fourth and Third Millennia B.C. Europe Between 4000 B.C. and 2000 B.C., Europe was a continent in transition. For most of continental Europe, people had been practicing Neolithic economies for up to two millennia; only in Britain and Scandinavia was the Neolithic transition still in progress. The social hierarchies which characterized the later Bronze and Iron Ages in many places were still at least half a millennium off. Yet, the long span of later prehistory was not an undifferentiated arc of generic "tribal" societies. Between the mid-fourth and mid-third millennia (which variously spans the later Neolithic, the Copper Age, and the earlier Bronze Age in different areas), most societies underwent a major social transition, one which has consistently defied classification in any simple linear way as an increase in hierarchy or social complexity. This transition has been identified with particular archaeological cultures in different parts of Europe, particularly with the Globular Amphora and Corded Wares in Eastern and Central Europe and the Bell Beakers in Western Europe, but these cases really provide partial, local, and often over-generalized instances of a much more widespread sea change which characterized most of Europe. There was no single cookie-cutter pattern of life "before" or "after." Rather, from about the mid- fourth millennium onwards, many groups made use of various combinations of general characteristics different from those which typified earlier Neolithic societies (Bintliff 1984; Sherratt 1994; Whittle 1996): • Much more elaborate and monumental burial practices, with the emergence of megalithic tombs across much of Western Europe • Less emphasis on central settlement places, with the decline of large villages or tell life in many areas, to be replaced by a more dispersed form of settlement • Intensified human-animal relations, with an increase in the scale of pastoralism and possibly an increase in dairying and wool use • A more central role for hunting, which had been economically marginal for much of Europe during the Early-Middle Neolithic but which appears at least symbolically important once again in the Late Neolithic-Copper Age • Metallurgy; the earliest experiments in metallurgy date to the Middle Neolithic in the Balkans, but metals came into widespread use, at least for a restricted set of forms and artifacts, from the later fourth millennium B.C. • A shift in long-distance trade from stones such as obsidian and flint to metals and (in some regions) fine flint useful for particular forms of axes or long blades; accompanying this was the rise, in some areas, of broad horizons of ceramic styles and innovations in flint-working, particularly in bifacial pressure flaking used to produce fine blades and arrow points • The widespread use of weaponry and ornamentation as gender symbolisms £} Springer</page><page sequence="7">168 Robb These changes create an obvious transition which has been explained many ways. Culture-historical explanations ascribed them to a horizon of Indo-European invaders spreading outwards from the South Russian steppes (Mallory 1989). While social interpretation of these changes has focused upon particular aspects, such as economic intensification (Sherratt 1981), an ideology of individual prestige competition (Shennan 1982), a shift in how relations between people were conceptualized (Thorpe and Richards 1984), a shift in formal social structure from "group-oriented" to "individualizing" chiefdoms or from "corporate" to "network" leadership strategies (Feinman 2001; Renfrew 1976), such explanations, if applicable at all, probably related only to specific areas. On a broader scale, it is clear that a general change from one widely shared cultural repertory to another was taking place. This is the context in which stelae emerge. Stelae in Fourth and Third Millennia B.C. Europe Stelae are a widespread form of statuary in later prehistoric Europe (Casini et al. 1995b; Casini and Fossati 2004; van Berg and Cauwe 1995). Materially, stelae consist of shaped stones, typically flattened into a tabular or slab-like form (Figs. 2, 3, and 4). They are usually about "life-size," ranging from about half a meter tall to 2 m tall; while many are recovered broken, the modal size for unbroken ones was probably about 1 .5 m. They are usually about a quarter or third as wide as they are tall. Most commonly, they are carved with anthropomorphic designs, though a few are known with other representational or geometric symbols. Common decorative elements include a face with eyes or brow-ridge and a nose, a neck or line delimiting the head from the upper body, and arms. There may be also additional anatomical details such as hands or legs. Stelae are commonly decorated with weaponry (daggers, axes, and bows) and with necklaces, and sometimes with carved representations of clothing as well. Materially, stelae are made from many kinds of stone, including sandstone (Lunigiana), limestone (Malta, Southern Italy), granite (Channel Islands), and schist Fig. 2 Stelae from Iberia and Southern France, a Heman Perez, Caceres, Spain (modified after Bueno Ramirez 1995: Fig. 34). b Saint-Sernin-sur-Rance, Aveyron, France (modified after Guilaine 1980: Fig. 14.5). c Bouisset, Herault, France (modified after Guilaine 1980: Fig. 14.4). £} Springer</page><page sequence="8">People of Stone: Stelae, Personhood, and Society 1 69 Fig. 3 Stelae from Italy and the Alps, a Pontevecchio, Lunigiana, Italy (modified after Cocchi Genick 1996: Fig. 171.1). b Pontevecchio, Lunigiana, Italy (modified after Cocchi Genick 1996: Fig. 171.2). c Petit-Chasseur, Sion, Canton Valais, Switzerland (modified after Gallay 1995: Fig. 7). d Lagundo, Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy (modified after Cocchi Genick 1996: Fig. 85.2). e Lagundo, Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy, front and back of same stela (modified after Cocchi Genick 1996: Fig. 85.3). f Castelluccio dei Sauri, Italy (modified after Tunzi Sisto 1995: Fig. 1). (Valcamonica) as well as others. They are typically shaped by splitting and hammering the rock, then smoothed by pecking and grinding to a smooth surface. Not infrequently the lowest part of the stela was left rough, suggesting it would not have been visible when the stela was erected with a shallow footer pit. In color, they range from tan to white or gray; they are rarely made of dark stone. Almost all examples have been recovered after exposure to the elements for a substantial time, and it is not known if they may have originally been painted. Stelae tend to occur in local concentrations which share a very homogeneous style within each group. About half a dozen major traditions occur, of which the best known are in the southern Ukraine and Moldova, in three areas of the Italian and Swiss Alps (the Trentino-Alto Adige, Valcamonica and Valtellina, and Val d'Aosta and Canton Valais, Switzerland), in Lunigiana in the Apuan Alps, and in Southern France. Considerable concentrations of stelae are also known in Sardinia, Corsica, and Iberia, with other examples also known from Southern Italy, Malta, the Paris Basin, the Channel Islands, Germany, Hungary, and Bulgaria. While it is impossible to estimate the total numbers of stelae in each group, the largest known groups are the Lunigiana group and the Ukrainian group, for which more than 1 00 examples are £} Springer</page><page sequence="9">170 Robb Fig. 4 Stelae from Eastern Europe: Natal'evka, Ukraine (modified after Mallory and Telehin 1995: Fig. 3:1, p. 323). known; for Southern France and Iberia, the total would probably come to between 50 and 100, and there are five to 25 examples known in most of the other traditions. Stelae are most commonly found out of archaeological context (indeed, it is not uncommon to find them re-used in modern buildings or walls), and in such cases, they tend to be dated stylistically and through their depiction of typologically identifiable artifacts (especially weapons); a few examples in all regions have been recovered in datable archaeological contexts, particularly burial monuments. All of the instances noted above date to between the mid-fourth millennium B.C. and the end of the third millennium B.C. Stela traditions continue in some areas throughout the Bronze and Iron Ages, for instance various Bronze Age examples including the Mycenaean stelae at Grave Circle A in Greece, and Iron Age traditions include the Villanovan, Daunian, and sporadic other examples in Italy. One of the mysteries of stela geography is how widely separated but clearly related traditions could have been maintained; it has been plausibly suggested that similar wooden representations which have not been preserved archaeologically were used in intervening areas (Barfield 2004). As a genre of material culture, stelae are generally quite distinct from the other forms of representation known in Holocene Europe - principally small figurines and rock art. In a few contexts, they do grade into other forms of "art"; this occurs principally in Iberia, northern and western France, and the Channel Islands, where some examples share imagery, form, or contexts with megalithic art. Stelae in Valcamonica and Valtellina, in the Italian Alps, also share conventions and imagery with the local rock art traditions (they are locally termed "statue-menhirs" for this reason; Robb 2008). However, these locations aside, stelae form a well-bounded, easily recognized form of human representation whose conventions are shared over a very large part of Europe. £} Springer</page><page sequence="10">People of Stone: Stelae, Personhood, and Society 171 Stelae are thus a widespread phenomenon in much of Europe between about 3500 and 2000 B.C. While each stela tradition has its own characteristics, there is also a set of widely shared formal conventions which unite far-flung local traditions. Archaeologists have not succeeded at explaining either of these facts. It has been argued that the widespread distribution of stelae reflects Indo-European migrations (Mallory 1989), but both the migrationist basis of this and the actual archaeological underpinning of this are doubtful - for instance why mid-fourth millennia stelae should turn up in tombs in the Paris Basin and on Gozo, why stelae are lacking in so many other archaeological traditions considered part of the Indo-European phylogeny, and why there are so many female stelae in statuary supposedly representing a warrior ideology. Instead, historically, stelae seem to appear by a process of convergence from varied local sources. In the Central Mediterranean, the earliest ones are small, quite abstract stone sculptures such as the Arnesano and Alfaedo examples (Graziosi 1974) which may derive from figurines and which parallel developments in small, schematic stone statuary in the Cyclades, Sardinia, and southern Spain. In the Atlantic facade, stelae may derive from menhirs and other megalithic structures (van Berg and Cauwe 1995). They may have had other, less archaeologically visible progenitors elsewhere. What is important is the process of convergence towards a common genre by people in different communities making parallel choices in the process of cultural transmission. Other, more social interpretations have focused upon stelae's use and meaning. The uses of stelae may have varied regionally, and very few examples anywhere have been recovered in good archaeological contexts. Nevertheless, they clearly occur in monumental, often funerary contexts: • In the Ukrainian, Bulgarian, and Hungarian examples, stelae seem to have served as grave or mound markers. • Two examples from the Maltese Islands seem to come from early to mid-fourth millennium chamber tombs. • In Southern Italy, stelae occur in groups or alignments at ritual sites (e.g., Bovino), though their association with burial there is unclear. • In Sardinia and Corsica, stelae occur in association with megalithic ritual places such as stone circles. • The Lunigiana stelae appear to have been erected in groups or alignments in open country, perhaps along pathways or transit routes; no funerary associations are known, but almost none have been excavated in context. The same is true for the Adige Valley group. • In Saint Martin (Val d'Aosta) in Italy and Sion in Switzerland, stelae were erected in alignments in front of megalithic burial chambers. • In Iberia, stelae tend to occur at burial sites, often of Bronze Age date. • In the Paris Basin, stelae occur in chamber tombs, where they may shade into anthropomorphic depictions carved directly upon the tomb architecture itself. Perhaps the most interesting example of stelae in context comes from Valcamonica. Stelae in Valcamonica (or more properly statue-menhirs, as they diverge from stelae in some formal characteristics) tend to occur in groups of up to ten stelae. At Ossimo-Anvoia (Fedele 1995, 2004), an alignment of stelae was £) Springer</page><page sequence="11">172 Robb excavated on a small plateau which may have accommodated up to 100 people at rituals in a clearing in the forest. The stelae had been erected, re-erected, and modified periodically, and a range of items including unusual natural stones had been deposited. While Ossimo-Anvoia was not a burial site per se, some cremated bone imported from a burial site elsewhere had been deposited under a cairn of stones. To the extent that a social interpretation has been given, stelae have alternately been regarded as representations of gods or of ancestral figures, with the latter view gradually becoming ascendant in recent times (Barfield 1995; Fedele 1995; Keates 2000). A collection of up to a dozen stelae would have been a large undertaking to construct and was probably done by and for a community rather than individuals or families. Choreographically, we must imagine a collection of stelae as a relatively permanent, visible component of a constructed place which was normally not inhabited but which would have been visited periodically, a place either directly used for burying the dead or involved with a chain of operations which involved remembering or presencing them. This brief account of stelae throws into relief two unanswered questions. What social contexts did the genre fit into, and how were these contexts related to the aesthetic qualities of the stelae? Aesthetics of the Body A good starting point for this discussion is to imagine the range of choices involved in representing the human body materially. Does one portray the entire body from head to foot or selected regions of it (a head? a votive foot or organ? A torso minus extremities like a Paleolithic "Venus")? Is the body represented in visually accurate detail or in exaggerated or distorted form to emphasize values such as sexuality, juvenility, or otherness? With individuating detail ("warts and all") or according to an idealized schema (as in Pharaonic sarcophagi) or both (as in Roman busts with standardized torsos but individual faces)? In a formalized, ritually significant pose, as in a police mug shot or class portrait, or with meaningful informality as in a family snapshot? Is metaphor invoked (the body as a machine, as microcosm, as a particular substance, as movements)? Are material qualities such as size, raw material, or durability used to impart meanings such as dominating grandeur (as in greater-than-life monumental statuary) or a miniaturized, intimate, or private world (as in figurines)? How does the medium position the viewer choreographically with relation to the body represented, and why? It is striking that virtually the entire conceptual possibility-space created by such choices has been used in the history of human representations. Moreover, different forms of representation are often used within different settings or for different uses within a single historical context. Such real variability provides a convincing argument that these choices are not random nor merely historical details but are intimately related to the context of representation at many scales. This gives us a basis for a close reading of the formal characteristics of Copper and Bronze Age stelae. Stelae vary dramatically in their formal characteristics from earlier forms of representation such as Neolithic figurines (Robb 2007, 2008), S Springer</page><page sequence="12">People of Stone: Stelae, Personhood, and Society 1 73 although they will be discussed here on their own. While the stelae corpuses noted above vary, they share some general features. Substance, Size, and Time As the potential human body morphs into the particular concrete Copper and Bronze Age stela, it takes on qualities of substance and size. The material chosen is stone. While it is somewhat circular to argue that stone was chosen specifically for its durability, since if less durable materials were also chosen we would not know about them archaeologically, it remains likely that the temporal properties of stone were appreciated. Much has been written about the general use of stone as a metaphor for permanence, time, and ancestry in the Western European Neolithic (Bradley 1991; Bradley 1998; Parker Pearson and Ramilsonina 1998; Tilley and Bennett 2004). Whether or not one subscribes to specific interpretations such as the ones proposed in these works, many of the material affordances of stone, in qualities such as mass, duration, immobility, and its apparent pre-existence in the earth rather than coming into being in a process such as animal or vegetative growth, lend it a different scale of temporality; throughout Europe in the fourth and third millennia B.C., people used such qualities to create meanings. It thus seems quite likely that persons of stone exist in a different temporality than persons of wood, bone, flesh, and blood, or other materials. This may be reinforced by size; Bailey (2005) has argued that miniaturization of human representations projects a quicker temporality than ones sized similarly to living humans, and the life size and great mass of many stelae may have slowed down time in interactions with them. It is also worth noting an aesthetic choice to make the boundaries of the represented body coterminous with the material it is carved upon; rather than having a block of stone with a person carved, upon it, as in a bas relief, stelae present a person made of stone. A very few sporadic examples suggest that the latter was a possibility, and hence the almost unanimous choice to make material and image coincide may be a visual means of reinforcing the identity of person and material. Choreographically, although stelae appear occasionally to have been moved and remodeled, it is assumed that stelae were immobile, both because of their mass as large stone slabs and because examples found in context are normally fixed in place. Relative mobility would have been an important element of materiality. When small figurines were manipulated manually, the figurine was mobile and the living human fixed relative to the situation of interaction. In contrast, stelae were relatively fixed, and humans were quick, possibly with both meanings of the word (e.g., alive and mobile). Stelae hence anchored landscapes in which people moved rather than the reverse. The Geometric Body One of the most notable features of stelae is their geometric schematism. The irregular, three-dimensional body is reduced to a formulaic representation which is common to virtually all stela traditions. The first step is to project the volumetric body onto a tabular surface: while stelae differ in thickness, this projection emphasizes not the body's corporeal mass (as in many figurines and as in the S Springer</page><page sequence="13">174 Robb contemporary, massive statues inappropriately called "fat ladies" from Malta) but its surfaces. The projection renders a rounded object as a slab-like rectangular volume with a clearly defined front and back. The visual emphasis is upon the front; in most stela traditions (the exceptions are the Ukrainian and Alto Adige traditions), there is very little detail carved upon the back and sides of the figure. The mandatory definition of a front, which is sometimes reinforced by the placement of stelae in monumental settings such as alignments, choreographs a static, formalized relationship which goes beyond the stela to encompass the viewer as well. Upon this slab-like figure, the body projection is laid out according to a fundamental bilateral symmetry which is only varied by the placement of occasional "accessories" such as dagger images, and according to a static, rigidly reproduced template (see below). The overall effect is to reduce the corporeal, mobile body into a formalized, static canvas for social display. One of the most striking effects of schematism is the loss of information. A body representation can convey many kinds of information - motion, individuality, texture, qualities, attitudes, gestures. It is interesting that the movement to schematism often happens in the history of body representations and is usually associated with promotion of a simplified, powerful message, whether a simple iconographic distinction (as in male and female icons on bathroom doors), generic rejection of an intellectual movement (as in twentieth-century modernist art), or presencing a particular semantic value in a particular context (as in Classical Greek phallic "herms"). The stelae's aesthetic qualities, which convey none of this information, carry out a powerful act of abstraction. There is very little attempt to define an individual biography or to show people in any different categories beyond genders and whatever category of person the stelae generically represent. The simplification of the body is a powerful act of concentration; it presents a concentrated statement about what essentially makes up a person, and what it loses in detail and nuance it gains in immediate, cross-context comprehensibility. Body Composition and Social Marking Stelae have a consistent and widely shared layout for how the body is defined. The foundation is a division of the body into either two zones - a head and a torso, separated by the neck, by a line representing it, or by a necklace - or three zones - the head, upper body, and lower body, with the latter two separated by a belt or waist line. Each zone is distinguished firstly by its relationship to the others within the overall body and secondly by a primary anatomical reference. For the head, this is not the combination of eyes and mouth we might intuitively draw but a T-shaped line uniting the brows and nose. For the upper body, this is often the arms, placed symmetrically at the sides. The lower body, when present, is usually defined simply by division from the upper body, with no further characteristics such as legs, knees, feet, or genitalia indicated. Stelae are gendered. It is a misconception to consider them as representing a patriarchical ideology, as is sometimes done (Mallory 1989); instead, in most traditions, both men and women are represented, often in relatively equal numbers, although there is some regional variation (the Ukrainian stelae are mostly be- weaponed, as are Iberian examples; in Northern France most examples are female, £) Springer</page><page sequence="14">People of Stone: Stelae, Personhood, and Society 175 although male symbols may be represented in megalithic art via representations of axes; Shee Twohig 1981). There has been widespread archaeological consensus on assigning female gender to stelae on which breasts are represented and male gender to stelae on which weapons are represented. Without imposing modern, essentialist assumptions about gender ideologies, this dichotomy rests upon a strong empirical pattern; the two symbolisms virtually never occur together on a single stelae, and in most series, every stela bears one or the other symbolism (see Whitehouse (1992) for Northern Italy). Necklaces are a consistent secondary symbol of femaleness in many traditions. In a few series, such as the Lunigiana and Alto Adige series, a few smaller stelae without breasts or weapons may indicate children. The very matter-of-fact consistency with which this understated definition of the body occurs makes it easy to overlook its most striking feature, the uniform template for depicting a body schematically. The most informative contrast is with Neolithic Central Mediterranean figurines, which have no consistently repeated arrangements of body zones. Within the territory of modern Italy, for example, Neolithic figurines variously represent the female form in "naturalistic" detail, as a rod with breasts, as a cone with arms, as an upper torso, as buttocks with the upper body indicated only by a shaft, and even with two heads (Robb 2007, 2008). Stelae, in contrast, represent the body not as a fluid arrangement of parts but as a standardized set of parts subordinated to a whole; the importance of each part derives from its place in a relatively fixed order. This presents the body not as a fluid assemblage of qualities or citations but as a whole, emphasizing the regularity of unity made up of internal diversity. What makes up a body? Whether or not one considers the body as a "natural symbol" (Douglas 1996) for society, it remains true that divisions of the body into zones, organs, or substances often supplies a fundamental map for understanding the nature of personhood. Gender ideologies, for instance, involve the localization of physical qualities by which men, women, or other genders are distinguished; many societies traditionally conceptualize stigmatized individuals such as witches as possessing different internal organs or physical souls; qualities such as intelligence, affection, bravery, or fertility are identified with zones such as the head, heart, or stomach. In the case of prehistoric European stelae, the consistent body divisions presumably represent a standard template for composing a body of different elements. We are unlikely to be able to know what body divisions represent without retrojecting more recent suppositions, and the suggestion of Dumezilian tripartition of functions such as leadership, courage and fertility among the head, upper body and lower body as a characteristic of prehistoric European culture (Dumezil 1973; Littleton 1982) remains an interesting but theoretically problematic possibility. Nevertheless, we can still make some pertinent observations about this way of "seeing" a body. First, these basic body divisions cross genders and presumably represent some basic concept about the composition of all humans. Secondly, the upper torso is the principal area of social marking and the localization of gender difference. Gender is indicated by breasts and by weapons located at the belt or on the upper torso rather than, say, genitalia; the lower body is effectively a null zone. This may perhaps indicate a social displacement of functions such as fertility from biology to social exchange: bodies were defined by their relations to material things £} Springer</page><page sequence="15">176 Robb which also marked living bodies and which were keys to other fields of social reproduction (see below). Social Contexts There are two obvious broader social contexts in which to place stelae. One is a general monumentalization of the landscape. While megalithic building is often associated (particularly in British theory) with Neolithic origins, it is probably more correct to think in chronological rather than evolutionary "stage" time here. There is a general wave of monumentalization across much of Europe after about 4000 B.C. Along the Atlantic and Baltic, this coincides with the Early Neolithic, but elsewhere, from France to Poland and throughout much of the Mediterranean, it can follow up to two millennia of nonmonumental Neolithic life, and it accompanies the end of the Neolithic. Monumental constructions (in earth and stone), rock art, and stelae are all part of this new marking of the landscape. Monumentalized landscapes may have been linked to ancestry via the meaningful use of stone as an enduring material, as discussed above. An associated fourth-millennium trend is the widespread rise in group burial ceremonialism, both in formal cemeteries of single burials and in communal tombs. In the few cases where stelae have been excavated in context, they appear to occur in funerary sites or in cult sites with redeposited human bone. The other relevant context concerns exchange, display, and prestige. There are relatively few clear and recurrent prestige symbolisms in the Neolithic up through about the mid-fourth millennium B.C. In contrast, during the late Neolithic and Copper Age, there are much more clearly marked and recurrent material symbol- izations of prestige. As noted above, both weapons and ornaments were display items made of traded materials; trade increased in this period, with new items being developed, particularly in metals and in fine quality flint used to make items such as daggers and axes. Beyond exchange, weapons particularly tie into identity symbol- isms in burial, rock art, and everyday life. A fourth-millennium resurgence in hunting and in associated technologies (e.g., pressure-flaked bifaces) may be associated. These characteristics tie into the stelae representations, not only iconographically but also stylistically in the aesthetics of representation. Iconographically, it is no surprise that the major diacritics distinguishing kinds of persons in stelae are derived from exchanged and displayed items which are prominent in a range of other archaeological contexts. Again, we should not take this at face value as an obvious or natural thing; comparison with the preceding Neolithic period, in which neither gender symbols nor exchanged items had such a role, shows it to be something novel to the Copper Age. It points to the new social centrality of both exchange and gender symbolism. Aesthetically, why would the stela convention be well-suited to convey such meanings? One reason was probably a shift in emphasis from the corporeal substance of the body to the surface of the body: the reduction of a body from a collection of parts, each with its own characteristic form and nature, to a simple geometric solid which provided a constant surface for social presentation. We might also suggest that a uniform template for the body, in which the individual body parts are subordinated representationally to a unifying conception, may result in a 4b Springer</page><page sequence="16">People of Stone: Stelae, Personhood, and Society 177 balanced or integrated rather than context-specific vision of the body, something which is consonant with the recurrence of a handful of key symbols in the presentation of the body across many contexts of social life. The Lived Body In many respects, the body portrayed in stelae corresponds well with bodies known in other contexts. Without going through the evidence for Late Neolithic, Copper Age, and Bronze Age bodies at length, it is worth noting some parallels. Key symbolisms turn up in other fields of social action. One is the use of stone, as noted above. Another obvious example is weaponry, which was used throughout much of Europe to define social maleness in burials in this period; the prominence of weaponry in rock art such as Valcamonica, Monte Bego, and the Spanish Levantine art probably also had gender connotations. In Northern Italy, for instance, the Alpine and Lunigiana stelae are mirrored by Copper Age burials at sites such as Remedello di Sotto (Manzi et al. 1997) and Spilamberto (Bagolini 1981) in which weaponry is a defining feature of male burials, a symbolism found not only elsewhere in Copper Age Italy but throughout fourth and third millennia Europe. These linkages tied stelae to systems of connotation known in other contexts of life and death. The Tyrolean "Ice Man" (Hopfel et al 1992; Spindler 1994; Spindler 1995) affords us a unique opportunity to compare the idealized body of the stelae with a real, contemporary body. The Ice Man is thought to have lived in or around the Val Venosta, a side valley off the Adige Valley in which a group of about a dozen stelae have been found (Pedrotti 1995). The Adige Valley stelae are generally dated to the early-mid third millennium, only a few centuries after the Ice Man lived. There are some striking parallels between the Ice Man and the stelae from this area. In defining the body, for example, the Adige Valley stelae portray the body down to the limit of the area covered by the Ice Man's knee-length tunic, which may have demarked the zone of the body relevant to social display. In both the stelae and the Ice Man's body, this zone is divided into an upper body and a lower body by a belt, which seems to have been the Ice Man's foundation garment, supporting his leggings and loincloth and probably worn in all situations in which he was clothed. This body was gendered male through the addition of weapons: the full panoply of knife, bow, arrows, and ax for the Ice Man, the Remedello dagger for the stone men. The Ice Man's stone knife, kept in a grass sheath probably hanging from the right side of his belt, would have been at the same position as daggers in some stelae; the fixity of position implies a body habituated to the specific gestures of drawing and using it. The upper body was the zone for social display: one of the peculiarities of the Adige group of stelae is the detailed portrayal of clothing, particularly the vertically striped tunic on the upper body which corresponds astonishingly with the Ice Man's visually striking tunic sewn from dark and light strips of animal skin. Finally, the local tradition of stelae in the Adige Valley and the adjacent Valcamonica/Valtellina tradition is characterized by citations of animals, particularly game, and of cosmological qualities (as in the "solar disks" in Valcamonica statue-menhirs). In the Ice Man's body, similar citation may be seen in his bearskin cap, a reference to &lt;?} Springer</page><page sequence="17">178 Robb the largest carnivore in the Alps, his shining copper ax, and the small disk of white, imported marble he carried. The Ice Man's body, thus, shows a living body composed in much the same way the stelae from his area were: divided into meaningful zones, gendered, created through exchange relationships to procure key material items, dressed in a local, highly visual tradition of costume, and adorned through citation of animals and qualities. However, the Ice Man's famous tattoos - the small groups of blue-black marks on his lower back, knees and ankles, the earliest tattoos known - provide a fascinating contrast. They too result from the action of other people upon the body which permanently changed it: making them was part of the social creation of the body. Yet, the tattoos clearly reference other systems of embodiment: they occur in a body zone rarely depicted upon stelae, no such marks are depicted upon stelae, and they imply visibility and perhaps relatedness in a particular, perhaps different context than the fully clothed body represented both by the stelae and the Ice Man in full regalia. They stand as a reminder that conceptions of embodiment within any society are rarely likely to be unique or univocal. Discussion Aesthetic elements of style guide the viewer in ways of seeing, but they presume a viewer predisposed or habituated to understanding the taken- for-granted meanings: what silent conventions are involved in understanding the trick of perspective, the movement from one panel to the next as the passage of time, the representation of spiritual power as light (Morphy 1992), or the derivation of aesthetic terms from a basic system of material reference such as cattle (Coote 1992)? The challenge in interpreting prehistoric aesthetics is to turn the interaction around and try to understand what we can deduce about the habituated reflexes of the viewer from the clues presented to guide them. The Late Neolithic, Copper, and Bronze Age stelae of Europe are made to present a highly conventionalized aesthetic which varies little from the Ukraine to Iberia. To review briefly some elements of this, it includes: 1 . Invocation of the material qualities of stone, including not only basic qualities such as mass and immobility but also an implied temporality of endurance and perhaps metaphorical associations with beings and places 2. Choreographic aspects such as the fixity of stelae relative to humans and the use of positioning and faces to create a context of action 3. A strongly schematized body geometry, characterized by a reduction of the potential layers of information to present a simple, regular division into body zones and the subordination of distinct body parts to a unifying whole 4. The use of gendered material symbols such as weaponry and ornaments to categorize the body in terms understandable from other contexts of life and death Comparison not only with contemporary burials and material culture but with the body of the Ice Man shows that, while the first two of these features are particular to 4y Springer</page><page sequence="18">People of Stone: Stelae, Personhood, and Society 1 79 stelae and their place in ritual practices, the others characterized lived and conceptualized bodies as well. While aesthetic patterns can never be read simply as a unique transcript of a social context, neither will they bear no relationship to their setting. Some links between stelae, material culture, and social ideals have been noted above, but they have not really got to the heart of the matter, the linkage between social context and aesthetic reflexes or ways of seeing. One reason for this, of course, is that this is an exceptionally difficult issue to affront even with copious ethnographic information (as in Gell's (1998) discussion of the reflex for the "creation of minimal difference" in Marquesan art), and to tackle it for material well back in prehistory requires couching it in the most tentative terms. Another reason is the problem of historical reconstruction: stelae occur in too many places, too many different contexts, and at too different dates to understand them as the simple diffusion of a single practice; they must be seen at most as part of a rather vaguely defined regional repertory of potential practices and beliefs. Yet, it is worth a try, if only to propose some possibilities. I have argued elsewhere (Robb 2007) that the fourth and third millennia in Europe were characterized by a "great simplification." It has been long recognized that there was a general shift in the nature of social reproduction in this period. To recount this model - which really posits heuristic ideal types - various archaeolog- ical sources suggest that, in much of continental Europe, sources of prestige were reorganized, from a heterarchical system in which people were valued for qualitatively different, separated activities and statuses to one in which a more generalized form of prestige was gained through participation in many different activities and which could be transferred from one sphere to another. Among the resulting archaeological patterns, we might cite the increased social centrality of exchange, the use of burial to construct extended networks of relatedness, economic intensification, and particularly the sudden visibility of readily identifiable, gendered symbols of social standing which are seen in many different social contexts (Robb 1995). Such a transformation implies a new conception of personhood as well. An earlier Neolithic social person would have drawn upon many different kinds of identity and relatedness; a fourth-third millennia person participated in a simplified and standardized form of personhood organized around fewer, more central concepts of value. This model suggests a context for understanding stela aesthetics. People formed stelae and installed them in the landscape to act as presences in special places, places in which the dead and the past were invoked or encountered. The salient element was probably the presence of the "people of stone" themselves in the place, their solidity, fixity, and materiality. But their aesthetic canon also conveyed a powerful social reality. The stelae present a standardized, simplified model of a social person in terms of gendered materialities familiar from other spheres of life. But - as befits a ritual context - the stelae also present this model in a strong, minimal way, in an abstract and formalized form which contrasts with, and clarifies, the multiple systems of meaning which form everyday life. Effectively, they present an essentialized view of personhood. It is a model of a singular person whose qualities are defined by relation to the whole and which is applicable across contexts, rather than the fluid accumulation of citations or context-specific choices suggested by the &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="19">180 Robb disparate spheres of activity of Neolithic life. The reductive schematism of the stelae, which flattens the body's corporeality to a simple surface for display of key symbols, excludes the alternative ways of creating social bodies suggested by the Ice Man's tattoos. The uniformity of stelae within a series echoes the general lack of social distinctions visible in burial and settlement, suggesting a different but still heterarchical form of society in which people competed for adequacy rather than superiority; although the new form of society contained the structural basis for hierarchy, it was rarely actualized. Human bodies can be represented in a staggering variety of ways. In ancient Europe, one might think of the twisted, shifting hybrids of early historic "animal art," of the active, varied people in Levantine rock art, of the schematic, minimally anthropomorphic "idols" of Copper Age southern Iberia, or of the robust but graceful "sleeping ladies" of Neolithic Malta. Such comparisons are useful to make us realize the many aesthetic choices involved in producing fourth-third millennia stelae as a specific kind of artifact. Like these body representations, the stelae were made to serve a particular purpose - in this case, grave markers or site furniture for rites of ancestry and kinship - but they also rested upon, and reproduced, fundamental conceptions of the body. Their purpose was surely not to impose or foreground these conceptions, which would have been all the more effectively expressed by the basic, assumed conventions of the genre. It is for this reason that the aesthetic conventions of stelae were a powerful medium for making their vision of personhood and social order seem obvious and taken for granted.
