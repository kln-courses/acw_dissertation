      <p>In this rich meditation on the meanings of taxidermy, Rachel Poliquin examines specimens ranging from those collected for sixteenth-century cabinets of wonder to hunting trophies repurposed as contemporary art. The bulk of her examples, however, reside in nineteenth-century collections in English and North American museums. She has traveled widely and observed keenly, and of all these stuffed birds and mammals she asks, “Why would anyone want to preserve an animal, and what is this animal-thing now?” (p. 7).</p>
      <p>Poliquin answers this question by viewing diverse examples through the lens of longing, taking inspiration from the poet and critic Susan Stewart's <italic>On Longing: Narratives of the Miniature, the Gigantic, the Souvenir, the Collection</italic> (Johns Hopkins, 1984). In Poliquin's reading, “longing” is the overarching response of Western audiences to taxidermied animals over four centuries. As objects that are both natural and cultural, remnants of once-living creatures as well as human creations, these specimens possess an authenticity, a “sheer, raw animal presence” (p. 105), that evokes a different human response than other forms of animal representation, a response akin to E. O. Wilson's idea of biophilia.</p>
      <p>In <italic>The Breathless Zoo</italic>, “longing” serves more as an organizing principle than a methodology. Poliquin elaborates on seven varieties of longing that have led to the creation of taxidermy: wonder, beauty, spectacle, order, narrative, allegory, and remembrance. Several of these chapters focus on the display of one species. “Beauty,” for example, is about hummingbirds, in particular William Bullock's early nineteenth-century collection, on display today in the Natural History Museum, London. But her purpose is not to deconstruct particular exhibits or to write fine-grained animal biographies. Rather, with reference to cultural studies, museum studies, and history of science, Poliquin aims to introduce a broad readership to nature/culture tensions embedded in the practice and display of taxidermy.</p>
      <p>Historians of science who are attuned to popular science, collecting, the response of audiences to nature on display, and the human–animal relationship will be familiar with Poliquin's message that “our perception of animals is tied up with our relation to them” (p. 81). Some well-known figures and displays appear in passing—the American taxidermy promoter William Hornaday, for example, as well as the scenes of animal combat popularized by Jules Verreaux in the 1860s and the 1920s habitat dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History's African Hall.</p>
      <p>Most engaging are the out-of-the-way and often odd collections that Poliquin brings to light. The Natural History Museum in Tring, England, for example, displays a room full of zebras positioned lying on shelves so as to economize on space. She also devotes attention to hunting trophies and to anthropomorphic Victorian scenes—for example, of ermines having a tea party.</p>
      <p>Today, taxidermy is resurging in popularity as home decor, and contemporary artists have reclaimed historic specimens, reinterpreted trophy heads, and in other ways created fresh meanings for stuffed specimens. Poliquin is up to date with these trends, and they serve to reinforce her message that the meanings of taxidermy are ever changing.</p>
      <p>In keeping with its highly visual subject, this book is beautifully produced, with dozens of high-quality illustrations and photographs. Also, it is one product of a larger endeavor that included a 2010 exhibition at the Museum of Vancouver and that continues to develop at the author's website, <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ravishingbeasts.com">www.ravishingbeasts.com</uri>.</p>
