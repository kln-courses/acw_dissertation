The Religion of Art: A Modernist Theme in British Literature, 1885-1925. Brooklyn: AMS Press, Inc., 2006: 31- 54. The Religion of Art was "not only a convention but an identity relying on sacred imagery and rhetoric for aesthetic purposes 'to evoke the transcendent': hence, the artist was seen as priest, saint, or visionary." Beckson does not refer to Shaw in his brief introduction. In his chapter on GBS he proposes - that "Shaw's daring intellectual vision and brilliant paradoxes throughout his career often confused his followers - as he did with his fable and the addendum concerning the black girl's Adventures when he refers to himself as a 'sort of unof- ficial Bishop of Everywhere' and the 'common sense' of Judas. His remarkable handling of the Religion of Art suggests his yearning for transcendence, and his devotion to Creative Evolution indicates his capacity for eminence." Beckson mentions or explicates A ndrocles, As Far as Thought Can Reach (Act V oí Methuselah), Methuselah, Candida, Disciple, Doctor's Dilemma, Household of Joseph (later Passion Play), In the Beginning, John Bull, Major Barbara, Man and Superman, Saint Joan, and Blanco Posnet, Black Girl, "On Going to Church," and Religious Speeches of Bernard Shaw.

Quotes GBS: "In George Bernard Shaw's words, 'The fact that a be- liever is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one.'" Dean, Joan FitzPatrick. Riot and Great Anger: Stage Censorship in Twentieth- Century Ireland. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2004. The principal comment on GBS elaborates Shaw's intention in writing Blanco Posnet: "The Abbey production was also a gesture of solidarity with the opponents of the Lord Chamberlain, first among them Shaw, but certainly Yeats and Synge as well. The startling departure of the English language's most prolix playwright into the one-act genre in 1909 was hardly a coincidence. By intentionally incurring the Lord Chamberlain's wrath, Shaw provided textbook examples of how ludi- crous the censorship had become. By exposing the Lord Chamber- lain's ridiculous standards, the Abbey production of Blanco Posnet may have had even greater impact in London than in Dublin. The con- frontation itself was carefully staged and highly theatrical, although Dublin Castle's threat to revoke the Abbey's patent was quite gen- uine." Death, Sarah G., translator.

Chapter Four is "Writing and History: T. E. Lawrence and Bernard and Charlotte Shaw": "The concern with history and writing is something I also explore in my discussion of T. E. Lawrence</page><page sequence="7">244 JOHN R. PFEIFFER and his relation with Bernard and Charlotte Shaw. Lawrence was a much recognized and interpreted figure who was a man of action and a soldier but had also been a strong scholar and became a sought- after writer. He was not comfortable in thinking about himself as a writer. Charlotte Shaw and he corresponded often and she recog- nized in him someone extraordinary. Bernard Shaw also exchanged letters with Lawrence and, with some prompting from his wife, cham- pioned Lawrence. The interpretation of character and writing is a key part of the textual traces of these relationships between Lawrence and the Shaws. The posthumous film portrays Lawrence in a different light, so that this cultural figure invites differing interpretations, Law- rence himself was subject to much attention as a hero and as a man of character. The Shavian belief in Lawrence could not allow him to accept the honors Britain might bestow, and Lawrence's complex character and circumstances led to the sack of a hero. Lawrence's public humility made it difficult for the armed forces to know what to do with him. The recognition of Charlotte Shaw, that is what she saw in Lawrence and he in her, could not spare him from living with a wound, another kind of Odysseus's scar. Lawrence was confident in his writing at certain times and could not see its worth at others. He wondered whether publishing was the right thing for the story of his life. Would he publish and perish? Lawrence was a genius of publicity who shunned the public eye and his Seven Pillars of Wisdom was pain- fully private in places but, by definition of being his work, an act of publicity. Would Lawrence allow a large publisher to bring it out or would he publish it by subscription or privately? The Shaws knew a great deal about writing and publishing and so this was part of the bond."

Sample: "Wilde and Shaw concurred that England was simply the last and most completely penetrated of all the British colo- nies. Their espousal of androgynous heroes and heroines may be seen as a critique of the prevailing macho-imperial styles. 'I would give Manchester back to the shepherds and Leeds to the stock-farmers,' proclaimed the youthful Wilde . . . , already as worried as any BBC2 presenter about the disappearing of the English countryside. 'Home Rule for England' became Shaw's favourite slogan; and whenever he was asked by bemused Londoners for the meaning of the terrible words Sinn Féin, he told them 'It is Irish for John Bull.'"

"I shall focus on Shaw's views on art and artists, examining some of his many critical and theoretical writings, but con- centrating on how his opinions were expressed in dramatic form in plays which particularly engage with such issues, namely, Candida (1895), Caesar and Cleopatra (1899), Mrs Warrens Profession (1902), Man and Superman (1905), The Doctor's Dilemma (1906), Pygmalion (Berlin: 1913; London: 1914), and Back to Methuselah (New York: 1922; London: 1923)." "Conclusion: Platonist, Philosopher, Puritan and Playwright. It is easy to become enmeshed in the complex web of Shaw's opinions on art and artists. A few constants do, however, emerge: a work of art must be grounded in the society from which it grows and must contribute to the progress ofthat society, spiritually,</page><page sequence="9">246 JOHN R. PFEIFFER morally or practically. Romance, prettiness and superficial sentiment will not serve. Great artists, be they poets, painters, craftsmen or dra- matists, must be philosophers, moralists or prophets of their own 're- ligion,' from which their art will draw its power. Shaw's own work is testimony to his aesthetics." Merriman, Victor. "Domestic and Imperial Politics in Britain and Ireland: The Testimony of Irish Theatre." A Companion to Modern British and Irish Drama. Edited by Mary Luckhurst. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2006: 7-21. Shaw "remains Ireland's outstanding public intellectual, a status vindicated by his John Bull's Other Island (1904), which deals directly with Ireland's relationship with imperial Britain. In this work, which Patrick Mason asserts is 'the Irish play,' Shaw stages historically rooted contradictions arising from relationships between persons mandated by their Britishness, and people mediated by their Irish- ness. As such, it is an exemplary artefact [sic] of Irish-British relations, and, with its accompanying prefaces and related essays, a robust in- tervention in a politics at once incorrigibly domestic and definitively imperial. Crucially for this chapter, John Bull . . . functions both as a play and as a kind of critical metatext, which provides a means of interrogating the radical credentials of subsequent artefacts of Irish theatre, and of strategies deployed to critique them."

These facts are important as a basis for understanding the satirical representation of Lawrence in the play's extravagant structure and personalities: "Too True to Be Good can be experienced as farce, or as fable, or as dream.

Daily Telegraph (London) (2 April 2007). . "Shaw's 100-Year-Old Play for Today," review of the Orange Tree (London) production of Major Barbara. Daily Telegraph (London) (26 October 2006). Collings, Janet. "Writing Environments: Shaw's and Yours: Architect Janet Collings on Authors and Their Writing Environments," The Author 117 (Summer 2006): 62-63. The article is principally about Shaw's rotating hut. "Shaw was a great 'techie' for his day, according to Paul Williamson, the current custodian of Shaw's Corner. He had electric- ity installed at a very early date, as witnessed by the accumulator house in the garden. He even had power and telephone cables threaded into his rotating hut. He used a typewriter there and was an early exponent of 'cut and paste,' literally cutting and gluing paper passages in different orders." Dierkes-Thrun, Petra. "Incest and the Trafficking of Women in Mrs War- rens Profession: 'It Runs in the Family.'" ELT 49.3 (2006): 293-310. Far from being insignificant, "the play's incest theme is intricately intertwined with Shaw's critique of the trafficking of women. . . . In- stead, it actually constitutes a strategically placed springboard for Vi- vie's determined jump into independence." "In cutting herself loose from all the emotional and financial ties that bind her to her mother, her lover/brother, and the mother's ready money supply that flows through the veins of her life just as unwantedly [sic] as the blood she shares with Mrs. Warren and possibly with Frank, Sir George, Praed, or the Reverend Samuel, Vivie Warren decides to sever the incestuous social and erotic bonds that fetter her to her mother's loathed broth- els, and to the various male suitors in the play."

"The thought crossed my mind then that Armageddon might start in Kashmir, since India immediately made it clear that there was a HINDU BOMB ready to answer the ISLAMIC BOMB. But with a CHRISTIAN BOMB and a JUDIAC BOMB always ready to enter the fray, there's no reason now why Armageddon couldn't start in, really, any damned place. So I'm pretty sure Shaw would say, let us not split hairs over who stops this from happening, believer or non-believer, let's just get it done! And perhaps we'll never get it done without convincing the Fundamentalists that giving up their Arma- geddon is 'God's Will,' if we can just get the words out of our mouths." Edgar, David.

'You'll never have a quiet world till you knock the patriotism out of the human race,' he wrote, in his recruiting play, O'Flaherty V.C. Shakespeare's poetry often touches war with glamour; Shaw's head- long, fantastical wit never does this. He asked no favours from those in power. As W. B.

This article contrasts the attitudes toward progress of three nineteenth-century works, Grillparzer's Ein Bruderzwist in Hamburg, Hebbel's Gyges und sein Ring, and Ibsen's Rosmersholm, to those in three works of Shaw, Man and Superman, Major Barbara, and Saint Joan, finding the former to have a balance between hope and doubt lacking in the Shaw works with their uncritical optimism.

"The polish reception of Shaw's dramas definitely began much earlier than in 1929 when The Apple Cart had its world premiere in Warsaw, or even earlier (Kupisz does not say how much earlier) than 1906 with the successful staging oí Candida. The beginning of this acquaintance was difficult and strenuous. Nev- ertheless, despite the initial failures, the Shavian innovative concept of theatre, as well as his unique sense of humour eventually won the favour of both Polish theatregoers and critics." Livesey, Ruth. "Socialism in Bloomsbury: Virginia Woolf and the Political Aesthetics of the 1880s." Yearbook of English Studies 37.1 (200 7): 126- 44. "In 1922 Virginia Woolf playfully killed off her Edwardian elders and thus, in a familiar manoeuvre in her works, left herself a Geor- gian orphan, self-tutored in her art. For Woolf, George Bernard Shaw and Beatrice Webb had come to stand as types of a generation lacking aesthetic content, whose members sought to change the world and its citizens through pragmatic material reforms and a high-realist prac- tice of representation." "For Woolf, however, the surviving traces of the political aesthetics of 1880s Bloomsbury were in many ways more problematic than the pragmatics of Shaw and the Webbs because they threatened her tentative steps towards forming an individualist and autonomous radical aesthetic. . . .

PFEIFFER represented something rather different: a radical sympathy that sought to elide the individual in the name of solidarity. This self- deadness was in sharp contradistinction to Woolf's interests in the aesthetics of subjective individuality, and it was troublingly close to the nineteenth-century association of womanhood with self-sacrifice and altruism. Woolf's works thus consistently deconstruct the affect of sympathy in pursuit of free, civilized individuality for a woman, and hence retreat from the ethical aesthetics of 1880s socialism."

Opera 57.8 (August 2006): 900-906. A nuanced reprise of Shaw's career and excellence as a music critic. "To me, Shaw's unique value as a critic of music is due to the fact that he wrote incomparably fine prose and that we was completely uninfluenced by fashion. He clearly agrees with his beloved Verdi that 'the boring is the worst of all styles.'" Porten, Lili. "The Metamorphosis of Commodities in Shaw's Pygmalion." Differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies 17.5 (2006): 69-86. "Though Shaw's Pygmalion does not in any obvious way enact a fan- tasy of anthropomorphism or blur the boundary between animate and inanimate, it explores the related phenomenon of commodifica- tion through which a market economy pulls all into its orbit, trans- forming human relationships into services so that 'the difference between persons and thing,' remarks Barbara Johnson, 'takes on a new form.' . . . Capitalism makes people themselves marketable goods. If, in vaunting his capacity to effect socioeconomic mobility, Henry Higgins implicitly represents education as a commodity (as cultural capital convertible to material well-being), in demystifying genteel speech and manners - in tying upper class identity to the ac- cumulation of cultural capital - he implies that individuals themselves are commodities." Pullman, Philip. "Best Books." The Week (4 May 2007): 35. Pullman is the author of the very successful His Dark Materials trilogy, and of a decidedly agnostic bent. Here he says Shaw is unjustifiably neglected. "His plays are not all talk, as they seem to be when badly directed, but intensely dramatic explorations of every kind of human emotion. And even those who find his plays too wordy might enjoy the letters [which Pullman recommends especially here]. What continues to de- light me even more than the brilliant wit and sparkling intelligence is the wide generosity, the unsentimental kindness of the man." Rousuck, J. Wynn.

Two early heroines [Grace of Philanderer and Mrs. Warren of Mrs Warren] of Shaw may remind them of the other side of the truth. Shaw's championing of women's causes does not only present him as a pioneer in the area. His views seem to contain a rare dynamism which remains equally forceful and compelling even today."

Stafford, Tony. "'The End of the Hearth and Home': The Deconstructing Fireplace in Shaw's Early Plays." The Independent Shavian 44.1-2 (2006): 17-30. "Shaw the iconoclast, perhaps as a result of his own dysfunctional family, does not have a romanticized or idealized atti- tude toward home and family, nor is it surprising that Shaw does not use the hearth and fireplace as symbols of the blissful home. Rather, in his early plays, such as Widowers' Houses, The Philanderer, Arms and the Man, and culminating in Candida, Shaw uses the fireplace, differ- ently in each play of course, as a means of deconstructing the concept of the well-functioning family in a contented home."

"Bernard Shaw's Henry Higgins: A Classic Asper- gen." ELT 49 .4 (2006): 388-97. "An Aspergen has difficulties in social interaction, lacks empathy, . . . has trouble with social role-taking and has unusual responses to the environment similar to those in autism. Cognitive and communicative development are within normal range. . . . Geniuses such as Alexander Graham Bell, Albert Einstein, and Bill Gates have been suspected of being Aspergens." The syn- drome was not described until 1944 - by Hans Asperger (added to DSM-IV [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders] in 1994). Usually interpreted as a "romantic leading man" in Pygmalion productions, the Higgins GBS wanted, it becomes clear from his script and negative reaction to the "romantic leading man" produc- tions, was emphatically "a middle-aged bully ... a middle-aged ado- lescent who displays bad manners, lurches about the stage, jingles coins in his pockets, has temper tantrums, and has a childlike attach- ment to his mother and his housekeeper." Shaw intended Higgins to present the personality of the "Aspergen" many decades before the disorder was described in medical literature. Weintraub, Stanley. "Playing the King." History Today 56.12 (December 2006): 20-22. Weintraub describes the history surrounding Shaw's writing of the uncollected playlet, "The King, the Constitution and the Lady," in the 6 December 1936 Evening Standard. "As Establish- ment diehards demanded that the King [Edward VIII] disavow Mrs. Simpson or the throne, among the friends who rallied around him was Edward Grigg, a Times journalist, now a Conservative MR Taking his cue from George Bernard Shaw's play The Apple Cart (1929), Grigg proposed to Edward that he should relinquish Windsor Castle to a legitimate successor and then campaign for elective power as leader of a parliamentary party. If he adopted the domestic politics of Lloyd George and the foreign policies of Churchill, Grigg suggested, he could become 'a well-nigh irresistible force at the polls.'" In the play- let, "Shaw was advising Edward VIII indirectly, and the British public directly, through the newspaper that with the support of the people the King could do as he pleased." Edward did, signing the instrument of abdication on 10 December 1936. See also "The King, . . ." in Works by Shaw, above. Wise, Ivan. "Jokes from the 1890s." The Shavian 10.2 (Spring 2006): 8-16.

"Explores George Bernard Shaw's contempt for the Victorian conceptualization of Shakespeare and argues for a new type of literary influence that is wholly unique to Shaw and to the dramatic genre. ... I examine Shaw's relationship with Shakespeare as a lens though which to view in Shaw what Harold Bloom has termed the 'anxiety of influence' as a creative force in the development of Shaw's historical characters. I argue that Shaw wants to be worthy of exerting influence on the same grand level as Shakespeare and deals with this anxiety by being as antithetical to his precursor as possible, often - in his efforts to be contrary - excising from his characters even those elements in Shake- speare that are congruous with his own thinking. Ultimately, using Shaw's Saint Joan, Man and Superman, and Caesar and Cleopatra, I as- sert that Shaw exists as an anomaly on the literary influence spectrum because of this relationship to a highly malleable Shakespeare who reemerges in the nineteenth century to contemporaneously challenge his Victorian counterpart."

Shaw had a lifelong fascination with Shakespeare. "First as a student and critic, and then as a playwright, Shaw saw in Shakespeare both a dra- matic idol and teacher - and a competing rival to be challenged, and overcome. ... I am examining Shaw's feelings of being a reincarna- tion of a playwright for whom he had both great regard, and of whom he wrote severe criticism. And in the larger context, this interaction between the two playwrights could be seen as part of Shaw's at- tempted mission to affect, or influence, early 20th-century modern- ism, by asserting the possibility of theatre as an agent for political action."

Van der Weyden reprises Shaw's "vitriolic criticism of doctors," and speculates upon "what Shaw would make of the medical profes- sion Australia if he were sitting in judgment today." Shaw would en- dorse Australia's Medicare scheme. He would welcome evidence- based medicine and marvel at medical research. He would note that medical research has become entangled with industry, and the com- plexity of the organization of medicine. He would congratulate the medical profession for being consistently endorsed by the public as an ethical and honest profession and be comforted by doctors' pros- perity. In Shaw's day, doctors were "hideously poor." On the other hand, Shaw would also detect undercurrents of discontent: He would notice too much bureaucracy; specialization has hastened the decline of the generalist; the erosion of the public's trust of doctors because of their increasing cooptation by the medical industry; and the current failure of the professional bodies representing doctors to speak with a unified voice.
