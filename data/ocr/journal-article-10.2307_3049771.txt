<plain_text><page sequence="1">Letters to the Editor Sir: In my review of Deborah Howard's Jacopo Sansovino (The Art Bulletin, LIx, 1977, 143ff), I questioned the bases of her conclusion that the awkward juxtaposition of orders and floor levels at the juncture of the lagoon fagades of the Zecca and the Library in Venice follows Sansovino's original design (the last bays of the Library at this end were finished by Scamozzi in 1588-1591, and he disclaimed responsibility for the design). I suggested that the author owed the. reader a rebuttal of Tafuri's proposal (Jacopo Sansovino e l'architettura del '500 a Venezia, Padua, 1969, 76) that the Library was intended by the architect to be two or three bays shorter and thus set back from the line of the Zecca fagade. Responding by letter, Dr. Howard called my attention to her earlier paper on the subject (Architectura, 1974: "Two Notes on Jacopo Sansovino, 2: A Problem in the History of Sansovino's Library," 137-46, cited in note 90 of the book), which demonstrates on conclusive documentary grounds-including a statement by Sansovino himself-that the existing situation reflects the original intention. I regret my oversight and offer my apologies. The evidence demonstrates, as she ably proves, that we are insufficiently sensitive to the aspect of Renaissance taste that generated irregularity and "variety." JAMES ACKERMAN Harvard University Sir: It was probably a wise decision not to have The Year 1200: A Symposium (The Year 1200, ii) merely reviewed in general terms as "a book," but it was equally unwise to expect one reviewer to be able to critically analyse all the individual contributions [Ed.: see Georgia Summers Wright, rev. in The Art Bulletin, March 1977, 131-33]. It would be to the advantage of our College Art Association to emulate the Bulletin monumental of the Societe Frangaise d'Archeologie, which distinguishes nicely in this regard between reviews of monographs (in the "Bibliographie") and the reporting of shorter studies grouped in specific categories ("Chronique"); this assures that a reviewer can be chosen who is capable of understanding the material sufficiently to make rational statements. A round dozen factual errors in a thirty-eight line review of my own contribution to the volume in question is indicative of the problem. Because the article is in English, the following salient errors can be verified by your readers. Nothing expressed by me can be interpreted to indicate: (1) "that the new west fagade tympanum was discarded because it was too large for the transept portal"; (2) "that one of the [crossing piers] was skewed [sic] in a way that cannot be due to a change of plan"; (3) that "light galleries...[terminated] at the risers of the porch steps rather than in windows"; (4) that "far greater errors [than 20cm have been made] in modern measurement of the fabric"; (5) that it was "Hamann-MacLean's idea...that the sculpture for the new west fagade of 1194 was distributed on the transepts"; (6) "that the Headmaster, unaccountably still at work on the old west fagade, was influenced by the transept sculpture" (what I clearly refer to is "a reworking of earlier sculptures"). The evidence does not lie (7) "in a comparison of the four bays west of the crossing. . .with the zigzag axes of the transept bays" but in the correspondence of exact dimensions; all ancillary observations simply corroborate the dimensions. Thus too, (8) the relationships of the dimensions prove "that the original plan must have been rational and unified"; it is not merely "because we call it classical." Defense of one's imagination or inquisitiveness is only justified if coupled to one's veracity; the entire article in fact concerns (9) "the physical problem of alligning...piers", etc.-but this problem only arises (or has to be "imagined") when extant masonry physically determines irregularities in the orderly system of new work (or when subsequently trying to determine the axis in later studies-cf. appendix B). With the help of a piece of string even your reviewer could set out the axis of piers of any varying diameter-at least there would be no physical problem. (10) If "Van der Meulen must ask why they [the subterranean transept galleries] were completed under [the terminal] bay," your readers could be led to believe that this lack of inquisitiveness somehow could affect the conclusions forced on us by the axial relationships; all I can inform your readers at this point is that in this century the gardien of the Cathedral, M. Henri Debarge, used the gallery in question to park his motorcycle and during the last century it was used for a wine cellar, but no earlier records as to its use exist. And finally, although your reviewer may, indeed (11), find it "impossible to tell what is being measured so minutely on the diagram," readers with more fortitude, if not training, will find it all there. * *P S. Also, (12) that I have not "[omitted] a set of measurements for the central portal that are [sic] essential to my argument..."-but this argument is, in any case, the one incorrectly reported by the reviewer under (1) above! JAN VAN DER MEULEN Cleveland State University Reply Sir: I wish to apologize to Professor van der Meulen for misreading his footnote on the Headmaster's figures. He does indeed suggest that many of the advanced figures of the west fagade were reworked under the influence of the transept sculpture. This idea is consistent with his presumption that a work must have been homogeneous and that inconsistencies should be explained as the result of the re-use of older pieces of sculpture, which he calls spolia, or, in this case, as the result of reworking. As for the other interpretations, I must leave it to the reader to judge whether they are warranted. GEORGIA SOMMERS WRIGHT Berkeley, California Sir: Your readers may be interested to know that Professor Howard Saalman's review of my book Pythagorean Palaces: Magic and Architecture in the Italian Renaissance (The Art Bulletin, LIx, 1977, 282-84) is actually the slightly modified text of a letter he sent my publishers at their request when they were seeking opinions as to the manuscript's possibilities for publication. That they went ahead with the book despite Saalman's attack probably explains why his letter now indignantly turns up in the form of a review. Meanwhile perhaps one reason why the publishers chose to disregard his criticisms is a second letter, written by me to counter Saalman's accusations. The following paragraphs, with a couple of added parentheses, are a r~sumb of that defense. Clearly, first of all, Saalman and I disagree as to how architectural history should be written. He believes in what is known as the "object-oriented" approach derived from positivism, empiricism, and postwar existentialism. To such scholars the only value of studying the artistic theories of the past is to find their application in material objects. This belief lies behind Saalman's assumption that my book tries, and fails, to investigate the way in which Pythagoreanism affected actual architecture. Or as he puts it, the monuments are only "casually investigated" and the book's "substance is thin" (though in fact most of the passages I analyse have never before been so fully gone into). The fact that I do not cite articles containing the sort of physical description Saalman admires shows that I neglect the "relevant literature." And he complains that my "personalized interpretation of 'Pythagorean cubism'" will not solve the problems</page><page sequence="2">LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 193 under consideration. These problems, for Saalman, involve the way in which "dimensioning systems work in Renaissance buildings." He himself is an advocate of ever fuller and more accurate measurements and has coined the word "iconometry" to describe his new science.' In other words, Saalman wants an architectural historiography that is allied to field archaeology. The truth is that I was not even trying to do what Saalman thinks should have been done. I was after a historiography allied to the history of ideas, a historiography that is not "object-oriented" but theory-oriented, that is based on the imaginative literature of Renaissance humanism and whose goal is critical and interpretative. Unfortunately, Saalman seems unable to describe or judge my book on this basis. Nor does the inappropriateness of his own method for the study of pre-19th-century architecture seem to have struck him. Yet it would seem axiomatic that the artifacts of a period must be approached through that period's own thought about those artifacts, rather than being deformed by the intellectual concerns of a quite different era. "Iconometry" might be a good way to study Labrouste but it will not do for Alberti, let alone Ficino (the key figure in my book, by the way, and whom Saalman does not even mention). Pythagoreanism, on the other hand, is a most useful key to Renaissance architectural thought. Yet though I demonstrate this more than sufficiently, and though I underscore every point with citations from the period-indeed the book is more an anthology than anything else-Saalman simply does not take it in. I show that Renaissance Pythagoreans saw not only quantity but quality in numbers; that to them proportions were not mere ratios between two or more numbers but sequences of special numbers endowed with living and divine characteristics, arranged in hierarchies, and having affinities with features of the world and of the universe. As a result, the shape, distribution, dimensions, proportions, and decoration of a building will also be involved with these things. None of this is alluded to by Saalman, who has eyes only for the more shopworn of the topics I perforce discuss, such as Alberti's Etruscan Temple and lineamenta. But above all there is Saalman's belief, as unflinching as it is unexamined, that the theory must explain the buildings causatively. Pythagoreanism, however, prefers another conception: it does not involve methods for laying out buildings so much as architectural number systems, systems to be studied in and of themselves. It was the material building that was the "method" or "tool"-and it was a rough tool, whose only philosophical function was to cause the imagination to work back toward the diagrams and numbers that had given birth to it, that stood within it, that transcended it, that have survived it, and that constitute its true reality. This reality is the Pythagorean palace whose design and construction my book deals with. One does not check diagrams like mine against buildings. One imagines them, rather, when one sees a building capable of generating them. (Similarly, if I may refer to an even more reductionist review of the book by Bruce Boucher [Times Literary Supplement, 18 March 1977, 323], one cannot argue that, if the Pythagoreans' anthropomorphic interpretation of number and form was not meant literally, then that interpretation ought to be ignored or made light of. To do this removes metaphor from its central place in Renaissance architectural theory. It takes the poetry quite literally out of Renaissance architecture. It does away with a fundamental Neoplatonic/ Pythagorean concept, namely that the material building is a small visible metonym for a vast invisible architecture. In other words, without being literally true these fantasies were tropes for principles that were felt to be expoundable in this way. But there is no end to Boucher's passion for denial. He also thinks that the metaphor of the invisible column did not exist-i.e., he is saying that it is improper on seeing a frieze and cornice alone on a building to envisage the rest of the order to which that frieze and cornice belong. He also implies that the column-diameter or intercolumniation was not used in the Renaissance as an overall module-this despite Scamozzi, Idea dell'architettura universale [1615], Ridgewood, N. J., 1964, I, 48, where the author specifies that he is laying out his building with all the spaces treated "as if they were intercolumniations." Thus too Boucher, ending with a sadistic cackle, says that I have had to put the Pythagoreanism into my texts before I can pull it out, and that this is the only magical aspect of my book. This can only mean that he thinks Renaissance theorists did not mention the subject at all, let alone discuss it. What does one do with so irrational a claim? One cannot even leaf through the writings of Scamozzi, Lomazzo, Colonna, or Barbaro without finding it on almost every page.) In short, despite Boucher's and Saalman's assertions, I am very far from reading into these texts more than they contain. It is my overly hardheaded critics who read too little into them, who do not take seriously what they do read, or who do not read them at all. And they compound their under-interpretations with denials of plain fact. The criticisms made by my two adversaries, in short, stem from ignorance as to the way number functioned in Renaissance thought; but in Saalman's case, as he multiplies and divides his error, it accretes further growths of illogic. Thus I say that the main floor of the Medici Palace is less a regular grid than that of the Strozzi. In response, Saalman flourishes Bulst's observation that the main floor of the Medici consists of three-room apartments. This, unlike what I say according to Saalman, "gives sound rhyme and reason" to the Medici plan. What kind of reply is this? There is nothing incompatible between the two propositions. On other occasions Saalman employs a different technique. He misstates what I say, says that this demeans scholarly research, and then paraphrases what I actually do say as his own, correct view. He snatches my conclusions from me and hits me over the head with them. Take the fact that Vitruvius does not make use of the term "cubices rationes," although he does try to define it. Saalman taxes me with ignoring this fact. Yet I affirm it from the outset, and also say that Vitruvius does not seem to employ "cubices rationes" in his design formulas. For Saalman this adds up to proof that I give too much importance to the term. And yet, as I frequently point out, it was not Vitruvius but his Renaissance commentators who discussed it so much-Barbaro and Cesariano being cases in point. ("Cubices," by the way, rather than the more orthodox "cubicae" is the form used by some of these writers, and I so transcribed it, as I also transcribed "corpo transparente" instead of "corpo trasparente.") As to the Manetti passage that Saalman takes me to task for mistranslating, at least I made sense of it. His own translation, as he omits to tell us, produces nonsense: "they drew elevations on strips of parchment graphs."2 Elsewhere, instead of depriving a phrase of meaning, Saalman gives it far too much. Lineamenta, he says, mean "all aspects of architectural planning prior to building." This is ludicrous: are specifications, contracts, models, and site surveys lineamenta? Saalman derives his notion from an occurrence of the word in De re aedificatoria I, 1, which is simply to be translated "mental image in line." I used an equivalent that was reasonable in context-"disembodied linear diagram." The fact is that Alberti used lineamenta to mean what any dictionary says it means-lines, drawings, design. In the present instance, the lines are mental, i.e., disembodied. I have indicated that some of Saalman's specific criticisms consist of logical, or philological, chimeras. That is true of the rest of what he says. But it would be a waste of time and energy to chase each and every one to its lair. As Alberti says when he has made his point, de his hactenus. GEORGE L.

HOWARD SAALMAN Carnegie-Mellon University Sir: Natalie Henderson has written in your journal an aggressive review of my book L'Iconographie musicale sous les Rois Bourbons, I (The Art Bulletin March 1977, 149-150). Her criticisms are based on tendentious allegations and historical errors. It is necessary to re-establish the truth. I shall do this with the serenity appropriate to a historical debate, and with the indispensable proofs. As far as organology is concerned, Henderson states that I have "hardly gone beyond cursory identification of instruments." As a matter of fact, the information I have given is from works published over the centuries in various countries and, in doubtful cases, I followed the advice of recognized authorities in organology. I worked in close collaboration with Mme. de Chambure, of international reputation. Barry Brook and Emanuel Winternitz showed a sympathetic interest in my work, which encouraged me to publish it. Various American museums have asked me for studies of pictures representing musical themes and have published them in their catalogues and bulletins. I have taken every care to be in a position to quote, in each case, a text or, failing that, an authoritative opinion. The plan I have adopted, which follows the themes dealt with by painters and engravers, is harshly attacked. For the 17th and 18th centuries, it is sufficient to compare a history of the visual arts with another dealing with music to see that there is no concordance of periods or similarity of trends. Rameau (1683-1764) cannot be placed in the Rococo style. Rather, he announces the return to antiquity. Failing any better scheme, the allocation of themes is handy for researchers and does not exclude devoting certain sections, for example, to Poussin or to the Caravaggistes. According to Henderson, musical iconography should limit itself to studying works of art whose sole "raison d'etre" is music and should present itself as "a philosophical-thematic study." The choices made in such a case would run the risk of arbitrariness, of error even, and of giving an incorrect view of reality. That new discipline must provide a historical panorama of two art forms. The 17th century, for the most part (until 1660-65), is noteworthy for the diversity of trends in literature as well as in the arts and music. In addition, foreign influences are at work, Italian, Flemish, sometimes Spanish and even English (for the lute and viols). Finally, there were the provincial schools that were often very active and, at times, of capital importance (Georges de la Tour was from Lorraine). For an overall exposition, one has to be eclectic, without forgetting that there was also a great variety in the production and evolution of the instruments. Let me turn now to the historical errors that Henderson attributes to me and that are, I regret to say, the result either of gaps in her knowledge or of her prejudices. Descartes laid it down that, in principle, "la prevention et la pr&amp;cipitation sont deux mattresses d'erreurs." If only she could have followed that wise saying! Henderson venerates as a supreme authority Baudoin's Iconographie, an elementary and, moreover, mediocre work. She believes she has found in it the irrefutable interpretation of the portrait of Mme. de Montespan by Netscher. Thus, the King's favorite is not represented as Venus, as I indicated, but because of the sphere in the painting together with other attributes, she becomes the "personification of music," in conformity with an engraving illustrating Baudoin's book. She adds that "apparently Louis, who adored music almost as much as women, enjoyed seeing his favorites allegorized in this manner." The story is a charming one, but what do we learn from history? Netscher (1639-1684), a pupil of Ter Borch, had decided to travel to Italy by sea in 1659. Having called at Bordeaux, he there married Maria Gotijn. Because of the harassments and persecutions suffered by the Protestants, he returned to The Hague in 1662, where he remained with painful memories of his stay in France and of the religious policy of Louis XIV, until his death. At that period, the reign of Mme. de Montespan (1666-1677) had not begun. It is unlikely that Netscher took with him Baudoin's Iconologie. Taught by Ter Borch, who was very learned in matters pertaining to symbols and emblems, Netscher was familiar with books of another quality. Gudlaugson's book on Ter Borch provides valuable information on this question. More serious still is the fact that the portrait is dated 1671 (catalogue of the Dresden Museum, 1908) or 1670 (catalogue, 1910). Now this was precisely when Louis XIV was preparing for aggression against the Low Countries by isolating them diplomatically. Colbert had already begun a tariff war with the aim of ruining the trade of the future enemy. The Dutch Gazettes were launching virulent attacks against Louis XIV, who was hated by the population that felt itself threatened. The invasion began on 12 June 1672. How can it be supposed, in a climate such as this, that Netscher, who had cause to complain of Louis XIV's police, would have wanted to flatter the King by an allegorical homage to his mistress? Gudlaugson, one of the best of modern connoisseurs of Dutch art, thought that there was a satirical ulterior motive in the Dresden painting. As the love affairs of the Sun King scandalized the strict Dutch Protestants, the assimilation of the portrait to Venus triumphing over Vulcan (M. de Montespan) furnished an ingenious and perfidious allusion. In the "classings" of the Rijksbureau at The Hague, this composition is given both in the series titled "portraits" and in the series "history-mythology" with the caption "Venus in de smidse van Vulcanus." Close to Venus, on a sculptured column, appears Cupid brandishing his bow, the specific attribute of Aphrodite. In her role as a planetary divinity, participating in the celestial harmony, Venus has a right to the sphere, which here serves above all to present the sign of the Lion, the attribute of Apollo, hence of the Sun King. The scales are one of the two houses of Venus. The anvil and hammers designate Vulcan, the deceived husband. This composition did not reveal its real significance directly to the uninitiated. In case a follower of Mme. de Montespan visited, it was easy to give the portrait a different explanation, leaving out certain features and the history of the Low Countries. This explanation is precisely what Henderson has accepted.' I had thought I had made such a confusion impossible by quoting the blunder of the engraver Ransonnette in a footnote. The portrait of Mme. de Montespan was a big success in Holland, where it was in conformity with public feeling, as is proved by the numerous imitations or copies still extant there, and in France as well. Mme. de Montespan, always haughty and often mocking and insolent, had many enemies: the double meaning of the portrait was a useful protection for it. On the subject of the Muses by Lesueur, Henderson is indignant because I remained faithful to the identifications that are given on the engravings of Bernard Picart, whereas she published an article in The Art Bulletin in December 1974 in which she thought she had revealed the Pythagorean implications of that picture and in which she changed the designation of several of the Muses. As that number of the magazine was not available in libraries in France until February 1975, the printing of my book was almost completed at that time (it was published on 6 March 1975). It was too late to alter the text. As the author of the article requests it, I must tell her frankly that, even if I had been able to, I would neither have quoted it nor changed the identification of the Muses. I have always sought to avoid polemics. In the case in question, the article contains nothing relating to the instruments represented, noteworthy though they are, and nothing on the manner of playing them that is very instructive: it is an unfortunate omission for musical iconography. According to the During the same period, there were other examples of political iconography with a double meaning. For example, the medal struck after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668), where Joshua is shown halting the progression of the sun, is an allusion to the diplomacy of Conrad van Beuningen who had brought about the failure of various schemes for aggrandizement of Louis XIV.</page><page sequence="4">LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 195 Pythagoreans, the Muses caused the rotation of the celestial spheres, of which there were eight: seven planets and the fixed stars. So it was necessary to reduce the number of the Muses to that figure. As no one knew what to do with the ninth Muse, it was necessary to suppress her: Thalia was the one to be eliminated. Yet she exists, according to Henderson herself, and this invalidates the Pythagorean character of this famous series. Lastly, the proposed changes in proper names are not credible. At that time, a senior magistrate could relegate Erato, the Muse of love poetry, to the second rank, but it would have seemed lacking in verisimilitude to do the same for Calliope, the most important of the Muses, the one who ruled her sisters in the absence of Apollo. Because of Baudoin still, and for diverse secondary peculiarities, Erato takes the place of Polymnia, who is supposed to be playing the triangle, a percussion instrument, hence a Dionysiac attribute, which is something no one had imagined for the Muse of the sacred hymns and of lyric poetry. Very wisely, the Louvre sticks to the traditions collected by Bernard Picart, who was an excellent connoisseur in musical matters and extremely cultivated. The cartouches of the paintings have not been changed and will not be. As for the Pythagorean theories, it would have been necessary to refer to the well-known works of antiquity, which the Humanists were very familiar with, and to the Humanists who formed part of the cultivated circles frequented by Le Sueur, and also to examine the various ancient sarcophagi (or their reproductions) in which the deceased musician accompained by a "reader" is represented in the company of eight Muses (Vatican Museum, S. Paolo fuori le Mura, etc.). This additional information would have voided the unfounded criticisms Henderson addressed to Bernard Picart. The third historical grievance concerns the Arion of S. Bourdon, which I noted in one line as an engraving, whereas this subject had already been included in the decoration of the H6tel de Bretonvil- liers. Henderson is incompletely informed. Mariette wrote that Bourdon "reflected little" and possessed "facility." It is the case here. He shifted onto his pupil Friquet (or Fricquet) the task of painting the Seven Arts personified in trompe-l'oeil by seven female figures (the allegories) and seven small paintings, in color, representing subjects taken from history, fable, and allegory. For Arion, as for the other subjects, he had given a sketch to Friquet and had made him a present of it. Afterwards, the same Friquet engraved the drawing: the print, even though it was incised, had little success, the composition of Bourdon, based upon two parallels, being too lacking in substance. Then Pierre Drevet bought the plates, rubbed out Friquet's name and put "Drevet excudit" in its place. Friquet's painting was entirely ruined by 1793, the year Moreau le Jeune and Lemonnier examined it. The sketches having disappeared, it follows that only an engraving remains, which sometimes bears a name and sometimes not. Bourdon's version is only of interest as a first stage of the iconographic composition elaborated on this theme. What then should I have referred to in place of this print? I could not, as in many other instances, overload my text with a story that was of course familiar to me. It is necessary to know when to limit oneself if one wants to be printed. As a member of the French Commission Sup&amp;rieure des Monuments Historiques for over a quarter of a century, I possess a rather full documentation on the H6tel de Bretonvilliers. Another of Henderson's reproaches: I did not state the present whereabouts of some paintings. The cases are rare and this was done at the request of collectors who fear robberies. Henderson will no longer feel "frustrated" by the lack of an index: it figures at the end of the second volume, as is frequently the case with this kind of publication. She will also find there a bibliography in which Baudoin is not listed: because of the incomplete and sometimes erroneous indications he gives, he does more harm than good to beginners. Henderson's mistake with Netscher's painting proves this once again. I wish sincerely that Henderson would complete her knowledge and that, when she has done so, in a decade or two, she will at last compose that musical iconography of France which, as she affirms in her conclusion, does not yet exist. A. P. DE MIRIMONDE Nogent-sur-Marne, France Reply Sir: A. P. de Mirimonde seems to have taken offense even where my review was complimentary, for I do not disparage his knowledge of organology, and in fact, made clear in the review that the best part of his book was its information on musical instruments. But too often his commentary on a work stops once the instruments have been identified, sometimes omitting even basic documentation (dates, locations), and sometimes omitting just that clarification of broader iconographic theme that scholars might naturally expect from a book of such apparent scope. In his letter, M. de Mirimonde attempts to present the sort of scholarly documentation that I found lacking in his book, but his arguments can be faulted in several respects. Most disturbing is his tendency to ignore the importance of a whole host of iconographical details found in the paintings under discussion, details that bear directly on the intended meanings of these works of art. Is it an accident that seven of Le Sueur's Muses resemble to a great degree the descriptions and illustrations of the Muses in that maligned book, Baudoin's French version of Ripa's Iconologia, a book that Le Sueur used repeatedly throughout his career?' It is not a question of venerating Baudoin or any other iconographical handbook, but of finding specific correspondences between painting and text which, by their number and specificity, convince us that the artist knew and used that handbook. If Le Sueur gives a wreath of myrtle and roses to his Muse playing a bass viol, we can hardly ignore Baudoin's use of such a wreath to distinguish the Muse Erato. De Mirimonde, in fact, avoids mentioning such petty iconographical details in his book and letter because they do not fit into his attempts to retain the traditional names of these Muses at all costs. Yet I am not the only scholar to have questioned Picart's 18th-century titles, for Jacques Thuillier and Albert Chsatelet, in their history of French painting, abandon Picart's title of Calliope for the Muse playing a harp, correctly re-entitling her Terpsichore, Muse of Choral Song and Dance. Calling one of the paintings from the H6tel Lambert series Melpomene, Erato et Polymnie, most of the Louvre catalogues identify Le Sueur's Muse playing the bass viol as Polymnia and the one holding the book as Erato. Yet there is an exception-Vicomte Both de Tauzia in his Louvre catalogue of 1886 reversed these two identifications, recognising the bass player as Erato, as I do. One could also cite the authority of the catalogue of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts where Le Sueur's preliminary drawing for this same figure bears the title, "La Muse Erato," but cataloguing traditions, like titles of engravings, prove no more than that someone thought those titles correct: they are to be verified or refuted by factual evidence. Not only does Le Sueur's bass player correspond in many ways to the image of Erato in the Iconologie, but she also resembles two more of Baudoin's figures from the same book-Poesie and Harmonie, as my study has shown. As for the Muse in the center background, she has to be Calliope by virtue of the heroic components accompanying her-the laurel wreath and the book representing the Odyssey. Neither Erato nor Polymnia are entitled to such attributes. De Mirimonde objects to Calliope's obscure position in the painting, but it is explained by the fact that here she is not meant to control her sisters; Le Sueur has instead designated Urania, shown conducting this musical ensemble, as the leader of the Muses. De Mirimonde thinks that a triangle is inappropriate for Polymnia, the Muse often associated with sacred hymn. But my study shows that Le Sueur gave the role of inventress of sacred song not to Polymnia, but to Melpomene, who sings from a music book with medieval notation. In 17th-century artistic usage, Polymnia appears most ' Among the many Le Sueur figures taken directly from Baudoin's Iconologie are: Beaut. de femme holding a mirror and spear who appeared in the Cabinet de l'Amour decorations of the mid-forties; Le Solstice d'est. from the large ceiling piece in the Cabinet des Muses, dated ca. 1654; and the composite figure of Magnificence-Magnanimity who holds center stage in the Allegory of Magnificence, Dayton Art Institute, painted in 1654 for the Louvre.</page><page sequence="5">196 THE ART BULLETIN commonly as the Muse of rhetoric, crowned with pearls and holding a scroll. In a preparatory drawing for the Muse with the triangle, Le Sueur gave her a crown of pearls, evidence that he conceived her as Polymnia. The motif of the triangle could be considered as Le Sueur's allusion to Polymnia's alternate role as the one who invented geometry, with the artist transforming the geometrical triangle into a musical instrument. Realizing that the Louvre, like most museums, does not rush to change traditional titles until a scholarly consensus is reached, I welcome the comments of other scholars regarding my re-identification of these Muses. De Mirimonde rejects my connection of Le Sueur's Muses with the spheres since all nine Muses are present in the ensemble. But the artist's source was undoubtedly one of the French editions of Conti's Mythologiae in which the only Muse who is not assigned a sphere-Calliope--is defined as "bon accord," and who consequently acquires a role in the Pythagorean scheme as the one who creates harmony between the others. I might add that there is not one absolutely fixed tradition assigning particular Muses to particular spheres, for the Mythologie links the Muses to the spheres in a very different manner from the most commonly cited source for this subject, the illustration to Gafurio's Practica musice (Milan, 1496), where Thalia is excluded from the harmony of the spheres, as De Mirimonde had noted. Le Sueur must have valued the philosophical concept that enabled music-making to rise to such a high symbolical level, and it is a pity that De Mirimonde, with his great love for music, misses the implications of Le Sueur's musical iconography. De Mirimonde's letter supplies interesting background material on Netscher's portrait of Mme. de Montespan, but none of this appeared in his book, not even the painting's date, an example of the kind of omission I criticized in my review. While discussing Gudlaugsson's theory that the work satirizes Louis XIV's mistress, M. de Mirimonde admits that this "satirical ulterior motive" reveals itself only to the initiated and grants the existence of a protective meaning meant to satisfy the followers of Mme. de Montespan. Thus I am justified in calling attention to the more obvious interpretation of the painting as an allegory of music, an interpretation the general public would have recognised because of numerous attributes right out of Ripa (whether in the French or the Italian versions)-a young woman seated on a sphere, the presence of music books, musical instruments, an anvil, and hammers placed inside scales. We must consider this last attribute carefully, for Netscher has chosen to put the hammers inside the basins of the scales as Ripa (and Baudoin) had indicated, evidence that he was creating, on the surface at least, an allegory of music. The references to Venus are certainly more obscure than the musical ones in this painting, but it is possible that the two were meant to exist side by side: the sensual delights of love and music are often linked in art, especially in a moralistic context, as for example, when Hercules at the crossroads is tempted by a beautiful woman whose symbols of pleasure include musical instruments. I approached De Mirimonde's book eager to "complete my knowledge" of musical iconography, and felt constantly frustrated by the scarcity of art-historical material in it, especially since many of the works cited are not well known outside of France. Undoubtedly, De Mirimonde possesses a great deal of information that he chose not to include in his text in order to save space. But speaking as one without access to this material, I would have expected to see it made available to the scholarly community in precisely such a book as this. Constrained by lack of space, the author could have used more footnotes, and to protect collectors, an understandable goal, he need only have used the usual label, "Private Collection," to inform the reader that a work is not located in a museum. I had mentioned Bourdon's Arion as one example (among many I could have chosen) of this book's need to give more detail about the historical context of the works of art mentioned. Whether the image of Arion in the engraving actually derives from Bourdon's own sketch or from a painting executed by Friquet after Bourdon's sketch (all useful information that belongs in the book), the image nevertheless does derive ultimately from the Bretonvilliers series of Arts and Sciences in which the young man is intended to represent music, and I was not wrong to have insisted that a fact so important to the image's meaning be stated. One further point: in criticizing De Mirimonde's decision to treat such a large number of works where music was a peripheral theme, I by no means meant to suggest, as he puts it, that "musical iconography should limit itself to studying works of art whose sole 'raison d'etre' is music," but only to suggest that his own book would have benefited from a fuller documentation and explanation of a more limited number of works.As it stands, the book has neither the penetration of a philosophical-thematic study nor the inclusiveness of an iconographical index. NATALIE HENDERSON Highland Park, New Jersey Sir: The article by Charles L. Kuhn in the December 1976 Art Bulletin, "The Mairhouser Epitaph: An Example of Late Sixteenth-Century Lutheran Iconography" (pp. 542-46), contains numerous errors in the transcriptions of the epitaphs illustrated. Although it is difficult for me to determine from the illustrations the punctuation of the Mairhauser epitaph and impossible to determine the text of the book in the relief, I have been able to transcribe the text of the epitaph and to construct a more probable reading for the book's inscription. The Podewitz epitaph is also imperfectly reproduced, but I am able to give a transcription for the last two lines. My transcriptions follow, together with comments and a listing of the words or phrases incorrectly transcribed in the article. ROBERT E.

Kuhn is obviously wrong. Since the illustration does not permit me to decipher the inscription, I can only guess at the correct reading, which may be as follows: DV SOLT GOTT DEM HERRN VO GANZEN HERZE DIENEN. It appears that there may be four lines of inscription on the book and that the upper left line contains the words DV SOLT. If this is so, then there well may be more to the inscription than Kuhn has given. Podewitz Epitaph Line 1 is not decipherable from the illustration. Charles L. Kuhn transcribes the second and third lines using both upper and lower case letters, but the inscription is only in upper'case. In addition, the following errors of transcription were made: line 2 MIHR KOMMEN VNT WERET INEN NICH line 3 DAN SOLCHER IST DAS REICH GOTTES 2 Kuhn: und Epitaph: VNT wehret WERET mein INEN 3 das DAN Sir: My monographA Classical Frieze by Jacques Louis David (Sacramento, CrockerArt Gallery, 1975) does not "echo more or less loudly" the articles of Schnapper (Revue du Louvre, 1974, 1975) any more than it does the reviewer's own observations on the Leonidas, although his remarks might lead one to think so (Art Bulletin, LIX, 1977, 445f.). I saw none of that material before the book was printed. The other literature on the Frieze thathecites (andmore) iscreditedinmy introductory chronicle and in the annotation, which is extensive. The S&amp;rullaz catalogue entry on the Grenoble portion ofthe Frieze (1974) reached me only when the elaborate apparatus ofmy work, already some years in making, was inpress (see ms. 9, 20). I am gratified that her findings add credence to my proposed date of 1780 (pp. 75-82) and further weight, thoughhardly certitude, to Hector's death and funeral as a subject perhaps intended for the now- reconstructedfrieze (cf., e.g., pp. 19, 34f., 40f., 49, 76). Nevertheless, as I havearguedatlength(pp. 16ff., 59ff., 80ff.), thatdrawing, whichwasleft unfinished and then mutilated, for all its augury of an influence on David's mature style and powers of synthesis, remains an assaying aggregation of references used in an epic and elliptical mode. The reviewer's quotations and interpretations of my statements are set in contexts that I do not recognize; they certainly do not represent my views. The motivations and emotions attributed to me are assumptions, and they are false. The intent of my work is explicit (p. 6), and wider than the reviewer allows; alas, it was notdesigned to meethis expectations. His allusions to my caution and conservatism in interpreting evidence, my giving credence to alternative explanations, and my attention to detail I consider high praise. I well appreciate the labors of the reviewer, and I am grateful that my publication was brought to the attention of your readers. I believe it can best speak for itself. SEYMOUR HOWARD University of California, Davis Sir: Eloise Angiola ("Nicola Pisano, Federigo Visconti and the classical style in Pisa," The Art Bulletin, LIX, 1977, 24, n. 155) refers to the dissertation on the Baptistery of Pisa prepared for the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, 1974. To correct the record, my dissertation, The Baptistery of Pisa, was submitted under the name of Christine Smith and accepted in 1975. Ms. Angiola's reference to my Marsyas article of 1972, cited in her n. 32, is accurate, save for the inadvertent misspelling of the author's name, which should be Hunnikin.
