COOMARASWAMY MUSEUM OF FINB ARTS, BOSTON EtV 10. 90. 1 asserts that the thousand-headed, thousand-eyed, thousand-footed Person ( purusa) ,l ' encompassing the earth on every side (bSumirn, visvs6to vrtv), ruled over the ten-fingered' (aty atisthad dasangularn), i. e. in Sayana's words, over 'the area de-limited by ten fingers' (dasangula- parimitarn desam), i. e. by ten inches. Now first as regards aty atitsthat: my ' ruled overn is prac- tically identical with Professor W.

In the other interpretation, which is that of some modern commentators and translators, at;ist;ha means to ' surpass ' literally-or ' transcend,' and das«n- gularn as an adverbial accusative is the measure by which the Person transcends the earth or the world. But I agree with Brown that das&amp;ngulam is the ' direct object ' of the verb, as are janan in RV 1. 64.13 and 10. 60. 3, and samandn in AB 10. 6. 1. 9; and with Dr. Scherman that to specify the measure of transcendence by ' ten inches 2 would be ' nichtssagend,' and that even if such a piece of theological nonsense were the ' meaning ' 2The references are to NVeber, Indische Studien 9.5; L.

Jana Sarkaraksya is assured of ' prominence amongst his peers ' (samanan atitisthl) . A majority of the translators it will suffice to mention Dr. Scher-man and Professor Brown- who regard daGangulam as the direct object of aty atisthat render the word by s heart*' A primary objection to this is the fact when we do find a specific measure assigned to the Person in the heart, the measure is not of; ten fingers ) but that of a v thumb ' (angu$thamatrah pur?"o . . . hrdaye samniri$tah, SU 4.12,6.17), and stress is laid on the immanent deity's infinite smallness (ang?"- t^matram anor anum, MIJ 6+ 38) *3 A stronger objection is the fact that the Purusasukta is cer- tainly a description of the divine operation and 3The Purusa being 'both within and without' (BG 13.15) is not only indefinitely small as he is in the heart- but indefinitely large (CU 3.14. 3, etc.) inas- much as he;fills these worlds (MU 6.26); his extenX sion is not a locomotion, but a total presence (KU 2. 21; BG 18. 20) . It is from the heart that he rises alp ( uditah ) and with his five ray-reins has fruition of sensibilia (MU 2. 6); which is as much as to say that the heart is his citadel or palace, but the sphere of the senses his field or domain,-just as in us the heart is the seat of the minds but the outer world is its range- xdxtoh implying that he ' rises ' in us like the sUxs in the sky. That the Cosmie Man is in fact the XPerson in the Sun' and universal percipient and eater of 'food' (all that supports existence in whatever mode, whether physical or mental ) is an explanation of the iconoZ graph;e representations of the sun as &amp; round face e conversely, man's face, the seat of his organs of percep- tion and nourishment, which correspond to the solar rays, is that part of him that is most analogous to the sun. This, of course, is most conspicuous in the case of the great solar heroes; for example, if the brilliance of Moses' face had to be veiled (Exodus 24.29-35), this i8 because ' Moses was the Sun ' (Zahar, Shelah. Lecha) . £ormal manifestation; he is the Cosmic Man, whose feet correspond to the earth head to the SkWr and eye to the sun, as is explicit in vv. 13,14. Why, thenS proceed from the visible earth his pedestal, not to the sky as logical antithesis, but to the 'heart' where the Lord is seated indeed, but as one who is 'hidden and hard to be seen n (dt4rdarsarn gxdharn anuprariston? gt4hahitam} :KU 2.12)? Professor Brown is surely on the right track when despite his rendering of dasan- gulam by; heart ' he adds: ' The reference is here possibly to the summit of the universea as in the next stansa,' in which the solar Person ' mounts above (to heaven) through food.&gt; There is con- firmation of this interpretation in AB 10. 6* 1. 9-11 where, in demonstrating the stations of the Vais- vanara-Purusa, A;vapati }iaikeya says that the sky is his ' superiority ' or ' prominence ' (attstha, n.) and points to his own head as the microcosmic equivalent of this ' prominenceS' to his own eye as the microcosmic equivalent of the sun, and so on, and analogically in AA 2.1. 4 where Brahma ' entered into man by the feet and crept upwards (urdh7na7n udasarpat) until he shone (rayata 4) at the head '; cf. TS 2. 3* 14. 6 ntcX utcca. . . pratas- thau. Similarly in MU 6. 6 the Atmans Pra- japatias head is the skys his feet the earth and his eye the sun In all these and other context3 the Deityas cosmic body is colTelated with the human body as microcosmic analogy (cf. Taittup. 2.1-5); but it must not be overlooked that there are at least three ways in which this can be done. The correspondence is ather with the whole of the human body as in CU 5. 18 and MU 6. 6; or with the head (from the hair to the chin) as in 8AB 9.3.1.3-6,10.6.1.10,11, BrSBh 1.2.31, 32, cf. Timae?" 44D-4bB; or with the eye alone, as in JIJB 4.24.12, 13 and BU 2.2.2. In most of these contexts the bodily measure is called a pradesa-matra. Pradega is a measured or ind;- cated field or ertent, situation or predicament a 'span' not of fi:xed value but to be understood according to the context. It will be a truism to 4 S Shone' is clearly the dominant sense here because of the regular connection of siras with sriyah, and with sri (§B 2. 1. 2. 8, 6. 1. 1. 7, JUB 4. 24. 11, AA 2. 1. 4 ete.); at the same time the sense s came to rest at or in the head a is not excluded, cf. notes 29, 35.

It will, how- evern be obvious that the specific dasangulam of the Purusasukta cannot imply a comparison with the whole of the human body or with the eye, a measure of 'ten inches &gt; being too small for the former and too large for the latter; the only pos- sible analogy is with the head. In AB 10. 6.1. lf., cf. JUB I. 42 and 43, and CU 5.12-18, A;vapati S:aikeya describes the Agni- Vaisvanara-Purusa's cosmic embodiments and in- dicates the microcosmic bodily correlates. The cosmic aspects are those of the Earth, the Purusa's footing or basement (pratistha), corresponding to the feet; Water, his riches (rayi), colTesponding to the bladder (vasti); Ether (akasa), his ampli- tude (bahqzlam) or spatial-self (atman), colTes- ponding to the bulk of the body (sartra) 5; Air 6 The reference here is undoubtedly to the elemental (bhautika) akasa as distinguished (e.g. by fiankara in BrSBh 1. 1. 22 and passim) from the unoriginated dkasa, kha, nabha, or vyoman with which Brahma can be equated (CU 3. 18. 1, BU 5. 1. 1), as Zeus is equated with a£@rip (Euripides, fr. 386 [941], etc.). The spatial and elemental dkasa is similarly the Ether referred to in the expressions akasa-sariram, ' whose body is space ' Brahma, TaittUp. 1. 6) and ah4Xtman, 'whose bodily- self is space ' ( CU 3. 14. 2, MU 6. 17 ) . This spatial and elemental Ether is the Atman's, Brahman's, Purusa's abode or body (BU 2.5.10, 3.7.12, 3.9.13, etc.); i.e. the cosmic field (deXa) in which the Self is omnipresent (CU 7. 25. 2), this world (loka, T07rOS), analogous to but to be distinguished from Eim who is our 'world (loka, TOtOS) in yonder world ' ( amusminl loke lokah, CU 1. 9. 3). As such, the quintessential element, itself the source and end of the other four (JUB 1. 31. 1; CU 1.9.1) is posterior to the ' ancient Ether ' that can be identified with the highest Brahman (BU 5.1.1, BrSBh 1.1.22, etc.) and being older than these worlds is older than the physical ' space ' that divides them. Cf. notes 31, 36. In that God assumes a cosmic body (with a part, as it were of his nature but without discontinuityy BG 15. 17, 13.16) the spatiality of this body is inevitable: as also because 'space is the vehicle of name and shape (CU 8.14.1), which are the two epiphanies by which Ee descends again (pratyavait) to this world (§B 11.2.3. 3-6, cf. JUB 4.22.7). 'Name and shape' (namarupe) may be compared to the ' word ' and ' flesh ' of John 1. 14. In MU 6. 6 Prajapati's cosmic (lokavats) body is called his 'coarsest' or 'densest' form (sthaviwtha tar?ffi); as such it corresponds to ' what in their essence was crude ' (kruram) and which the Gods having 'measured out' (rirmdya) became the cosmic Agni (JB 3.261-3). The gross cosmic body of God is evidently the material counterpart or image of that 'fairest form' (kalyarea- (vayu), the diversity of his procession (prthag- uartmanarn ) ,6 corresponding to the breath (prana); Sun, his Soma-brilliance (sutawtejas),7 taram rupam) that can be seen only through and beyond the Sundoor (BU 6.15; I§aUp. 16), i.e. in tlle 'farther half' ( pare ardhe), ' beyond the sky' ( parena divam), Plato's hyper-uranian empyrean 'of which no true tale has ever been told,' cf. fiB 1. 2. 1. 12. T}le mystery of Brahma's abscondence and return (parardham apacchat . . . protyovatt, fiB 11. 2. 3. 3) and of avatarana generally (a mystery because a divine locomotion is apparently implied) is exactly paralleled in the Lurianic doctrine according to which God withdrew from the primordial space 'in order to return to it in the act of creation and revelation . . . [of ] himself in firm contours ' (G. G. Scholem, Slajor Trends in JeSurish lKysticism, 257 [Jerusalem, 1941]); i.e. rupena caiva rwdmnd ca, AB. ibid., and in the same way that the Bodhisatta assumes a nirmdna-kaya, a dimensioned body. The first act of creation is, accordingly, from this point of view, one of divine contraction, the second as it were one of re-entry into the domain of the finite that had been, so to speak, separated off from the Infinite. Some such conception is everywhere presupposed by the formula of ' entering into ' ( vis, pravis, vivts ) a pre- existing creation, to animate it, as in MU 2. 6; a ' descent ' comparable to the entrance ( pravesa, avaw tarana ) of an actor from the greenroom to appear in some guise upon an already existing stage; as also in Genesis, where the material man already exists before the Maker animates him. These are, then strictly mythical formulations; there can be no real coming or going in the sense of a locomotion ( IsaUp. 4, 5), and certainly no real exclusion of the finite from the in- Snite; creation is a conceptual explication, as is implied by vy akalpayan in RV 10. 90. 11 and crttarn eva ht sarnsaram in MU 6. 34. 3. 6 Prthag-vartmanam: the deity's coming and going as alluded to in RV 1. 164. 31, 38 and JUB 3. 37. 3, and illustrated by the in- and ex-halation of the Breath ( pranah) through the nostrils, to which Asvapati points. 'Mitra and Varuna are, indeed, the in- and out-breath- ing ' (pranodUnatb, pranaponaqx, AB 1. 8. 3. 12 and 8. 4. 2. 6 PB 6. 10. 5). ' Just as the human organism exists through the double process of inhalation and exhalation and the one cannot be conceived without the other, so also the whole of Creation constitutes a gigantic process of divine inhalation and exhalation ' ( G. G. Scholem, Major Trends in Jewgsh Bysticism, 260 [1941]): 'pro- cession and reversion together constitute a single move- ment, the diastole-systole which is the life of the universe.... Being, which becomes Life by procession, becomes Intelligence by reversion ' ( E. R. Dodds, Pro- clus, the Elemerats of Theolopy, 219, 222 [1933] ) .

AV 2.36.3 v* rajatv, Clet her rule,' and CU 2. 16. 2 virczjati, ' shines like a king.' 8 The correlation of the solar Eye of the Gods with the human eye is familiar ill all traditions (e. g. Repqxbltc 508 A, B, 517 B; Marsilio Ficino, Comm. in conviviqbnz Platonis de amore 6. 13, ' Sol oculos generat, vimque illis praestat videndi ' ) . The solar Self being the Common Self of all things (RV 1. 115. 1), the Sun s becoming vision, inhabits the eyes ' (AA 2. 4. 2) and is the only seer ( BU 3. 7. 23 ) who looks about in all beings (KU 4.6), so that it is by his ray that whoever sees, sees (JUB 1. 28. 8 ) . The ' little person v ( kantnaka, kqbnwarak; KOp; p¢pilla; bath, 'sshon; t'¢ng, mo) that we &amp;ee in one another's eyes is taken to be the image of the solar Person who looks out from seer and seen alikes-and sees nothing but himself, pqxrqbsa-vidharn ( BU 1. 4. 1 = purzea-rupena, AA 2. 2. 2 ); and inas- much it is for the sake of the Self, and no other, that all things are dear (BU 1. 4. 8, 2. 4 and 4. 5), the ' apple ( pupil ) of the eye ' has naturally come to represent whatever may be our dearest treasure. For the history of the word 'apple' in this conneetion cf. M. B. Ogle 'The Apple of the Eye,' TAPA 73.181-91 (1942). The whole theme of the ( Person in the Eye n requires a more extended treatment; the late Professor A. A. Bowman's discussion in St?dies in the Philosophy of Religion, 1. 250 f. ( 1938 ) is quite inadequate and partly also in- accurate. 9 Atistha, i. e. where the Vai§vanara-Purusa atitis- thati; just as the ea;rth (bhumi in RV) is his pratistha, 'footing' or ' support. These two stations, ati- and prati-, slaper- and sub-, are macrocosmically sky and earth, architecturally roof and floor or capital (ef. AV 10. 7.18r Vaisvanara as 'head' of the Skambha, Axis Mundi) and base, and somatically head and feet or (as in the present contest) crown and chin, or (as in BU 2. 2. 2. ) upper and lower eyelids. With atistha in the present context cf. also AV 3. 22. 1-6 where, in a prayer for consecration with ' elephantine glory ' ( hasti-vareasa, i. e. -tejas) the elephant's outstanding superiority or royal supremacy with respect to other animals ( or eIephants, e. g. the Maruts of RV 1. 64. 7) is expressed by the words mrgdecim attsthdvan; and BU 2. 1. 2 where the solar Purusa is 'the outstanding head and king of all beings ' ( atisthd h sarqnesam bhuta¢am murd Ed rd ja ) . I have not been able to find a single context in which ati§tha (whether as verb, noun or adjective) is accom- of one's whole life,10 amounts to nothing but a separative, partial mode of nourishment. ; In reality,' he concludes, ' these well-known Gods are concurrent (coincide) in the measure of a span (pradesa-rnsitra. . .sampannah), and I shall so demonstrate them to you as to malie them concur (sampad ) in the measure of a span.' 11 panied by an instrumental expressing an aetual measure of exeess. Atistha takes either the aeeusative or the eolleetive genitive of whatever is surpassed; and it may be observed that eonversely those who are surpassed are said to ' attend upon him ' who is their superior, stha without at* expressing their relationship to him as in PB 7. 5. 3 where 'his peers attend upon him as their superior ( tisthante tsrna* samaw h sresthyaya ) who is a Comprehensor of this,' viz. of the doetrine of the relationship of Prajapati and the Breaths ( pransh ) 'who attended upon him as their superior' (tasmaitah sresthyayatisthonta). Henee it appears to me that aty atisthat in RV, like atisthdh and atist7Zqw?w elsewhere, implies an outstanding supremaey, indeed, but not in the literal sense of an exeess that eould be measured in inehes. 10 Eere, the usual srelative immortality' of ' not dying' before old age; but in the last verse, the fruit of the knowledge of the unified Vaisvanara-Purusa, although deseribed in the same termsy is doubtless intended to be an aeviternal immortality, the Cthou- sand years ' of AB 11. 1. 6. 6, 15. 11 The Supreme Lord is said to be prddesa-matra 'beeause of the eoineidenee' (sampatti)* of his aspeets in that area (BrSBh 1.2.31). Thibaut's 'imaginative identifieation ' ( SBE 34. 151 ) is hardly a satisfaetory rendering of sampatti *, whieh is a ' eoneurrenee ' as el&amp;ewhere expressed by sama$ti, as in Sayan. a on CB 1. 6. 1. 20: ' Inasmueh as Prajapati is the colleetive- entirety (sama$ti) of all the Gods, it cannot be said that "He is sueh and sueh a one," and that is why he is ealled " undefined " ' ( anirukta) . He is, of eourse, both ' defined and undefined ' ( niruktanirqxkta, passim), so that qualities ean be both affirmed and denied in him; and it will be seen that AB 10. 6.1 is a perfeet example of the proeedure advoeated in MU 4. 6 where the trini- tarian aspeets of Brahma are to be eontemplated and lead to eorresponding partial fruitions, so that by them one rises higher and higher in the worldsf but aftel these have been praised they are to be denied, in order to the realisation of the Purusas unity. The sueeessive procedures are those of the via agrmativa and quia nepatiqua (or remotionts) whieh are equally followed in Christian theology and whieh are demanded by the coneept of the ' single essence and two natures ' implied by such expressions as niruktd nirukta, qnyaktcl vyakta, sabdasabdha, bahir anta£ ca bh?6tanarrwa ekas cu6 bahovas ca, and explieitly formulated in WIU 7. 11. 8, ' The Great Atman is of twofold nature ' (dvaiti-bhdva), by no * Sampatti, like sambhxti (of the Breaths) in JUB 4&gt;7&gt;4; cf. tad urdEvam samuhanti, tad asyaitac chiras, Prajipati's ' head,' in AB 6. 1. 1. 7.</page><page sequence="5">COOMASWAMY: Rgvedzz 10. 90. 1 { aty atisthad dSangulam " 149 Then ' pointing to (the top of) his head 2 (murd- hanam upadi,san) 12 he says: ' This, indeed, is the Vaisvanara precedence (ati$tha); pointing to his eyes, This, indeed, is the Vaisvanara Soma-brilli- ance; pointing to his nostrils, This, indeed, is the Vaisvanara Diversity of Procession; pointing to means contradictory of the s unity ' ( ekatvam ) predi- cated in 4. 6. ' Not that the one is two,' as Hermes says, s but that the two are one ' (Lib. 16. 3) . So there is nothing ' imaginative ' about the sompotti; all that could be called ' imaginative ' (manasa rrwatam yad idarrw pasate! ) is the use of the pradesa-matra as a basis for the contemplation of the ultimate unification. 12' Pointing to ' the parts of the head as in-dic-ative (evAeros) signs, or as Hume says in the same connec- tion in CU 5.18.1, speaking ' deictically ' (derKTsKos) .

For ' as in a mirror, so It is seen in oneself, (tathd 'tmans . . . dcidrse, KU 6. 5, cf. KausUp. 4. 2). The Deity can thus, in fact, be seen ' directly ' in any of his proper symbols (rupa); for example, ' the horse is of Prajapati's nature, and so, addressing himself to him (Prajapati, represented by the horse), directly ( sakeat), he edifies the fire-altar . . . he . . . indeed reaches Eim (Prajapati, Indr*, the Sun) directly' (saksat, TS 5. 7. 2. 2, 3 ) . Still another epiphany can be pointed to in the formal entertainment of guests: ' whoever would know " the Brahma face to face " ( brohma praty- dkwam) . . . [may be told that] when the Guestmaster beholds ( pratip&amp;Syati ) his guests before him, he sees the place of sacrifice to the Gods ' (devayajanam, AV 9. 6. 1-3). A striking example of such an adesatn appears in TaittUp. 1. 12, tvam eva pratyakeam brah- mdai,* tvam eva pratyaksom brohmavAdwam, ' hox art the visible Brahma; thy very self as the " visible Brahma " have I pointed out.' Such a vision of the ' Brahma face to face ' (sakead brahma) survives in Buddhism, e.g. in Sn 508 where Magha recognizes the sakkhi brahma (here, Brahma) in the Buddha ' seen today ' ( a jja dittho ) and to whom he is actually speaking. I think it has been overlooked to what extent exem- plification, illustration, predication (padesa = adesa as in TaittUp. 2. 3, JUB 4. 21. 4, 4. 24. 12 13 ) as distinct from narrative exposition ( d khyana ) is, as the term itself implies ( ^/dis, AEIIi, IK in disa, desa, dico, indew, condition, d£e7 ) a deictic procedure, the llse of demonstrative gesture. As Eggeling assumes in SBE 12. xlvii, ' the performance of sacrifices was taught as a practical art' while 'the theoretic instruction [i. e. gtbhyd adesah, CU 3. 50 2, 4], supplied by the Brahmanas, was conveyed orally in connection with such practical performances.'

Thus in BU 2. 5. 19 ' This is to be regarded as one of iEfis forms,' the speaker evidently pointing to himself. Other examples of such Xupadesa are TS 5. 7. 26 where in saying three times ' This is thy world ' the speaker evidently points to earth, air, and sky, as in AA 2. 4. 3 ayam . . . ayarrw . . . ayam: AB 1. 17 where, as Keith says 'ime . . . ime because gestures are used '; JUB 1. 31. 7, 8 amusyam . . . asyam, referring to the zenith and nadir; and JUB 1. 43. 9, 10 where it can hardly be doubted that the expositor points to the sun and to his own eyes, since of each of these forms it can be said ' such is His demonstrable (praticaksanoya) form' (ib. 1.44.2 with RV 6. 47. 16). The like is implied in Buddhism by the often repeated allusions to ' the finger and the moon,'- the teacher saying, Look, but the stupid pupil only looks at the finger and does not see the moon at which it is pointing. So in our context, when Asvapati points to his heady a ' nothing-morist ' ( such as Sextus Empiricus, who regards ' indicative signs ' as arbitrary and main- tains that only ' commemorative signs,' e.g. smoke of fire, are reliable, Pyrrh. 2. 97 ff. ) might say, I see nothing but your own head,-whereas 'the man of learning marks even what has been left unsaid (anxk- tam), men of intellect enjoy the knowledge of what has only been hinted at ' (Pancatantra 1. 44). All these considerations are of equal application to the use of images of any kind as supports of contemplation; the blind are those who see only the aesthetic surfaces of the work of art and deny that these are the vehicle of any meaning, and for whom the sign is an end in itself, and not a pointer. Closely related to an scarya's /Ispadesa is the Sadhaka's own nyasa, cf. Monier-Williams, Brahmantsm and Hin- dxism, 20S, and Sir John Woodroffe, Psychology of Hindu Religious Ritual, IAL 1. 80 [ 1925] . 1$ Xkasa, like kha ( = %aajua, as in Philo, Agr. 97 ) is a common designation of the doors or orifices through which the powers of perception are extended to make contact with their objects; thus, JUB 2. 11. 11 ' he made openings ( akasan ) for the Breaths^' into which they entered; KU 4. 1 ' pierced the openings ' (kharwi); Philo, Mipr. 188, LA 1.12. Cf. note 33. 14 The same analysis of Agni-Vaisvanara's facial aspect is made in fiB 9. 1. 4-6 (where the parts of the face are indicated by the arrangement of the Maruta cakes, which represent the Breaths), and here it is added that the hairs of the beard correspond to plants growing on the earth; the same must be understood in AA 2. 4. 1, 2, where in the sequence mouth, nostrils, eyes, ears and 'skin' (tvac, often in RV=surface of the earth), this</page><page sequence="6">150 COOMA:RASWAMY: RgveX 10. 90. j " aty at"thad dmangulam " mana adds: ' This Universally-human Fire (Agni- Vaisvanara) is none other than the Person, or Mant5 (p?4rusa); and whoever thus knows him manwise and as abiding in man (purqlsa-vidham pqlrqlse 'ntah), strikes off death and lives out the whole of life.' In nearly the same way in CU 5.12-18 A;vapati S:aikeya, in answer to the question, 'Who is our Self (atman) ? Who is Brahma9'praises hispupils several recognitions of the localised aspects of the Universally-human Self (vaissanara atman) a but concludes: ' Ye, indeed, eat food only here in this world, who know this Universally-human Self separately ( p.rthak ) .16 One, however, who re- sorts to (besits, reveres) this Universally-human Self as of the measure of a span (pradesa-matram) and as immeasurable (abSivimanam),l7 thus, he eats food in all worlds, all beings, all selves. The brilliant (s?4tejas) (sky) is the (top of the) head of that Universally-human Self; the omniform (vissarupa) (sun) is his eye; what moves diversely (the gale) is his breath; the manifold is his bodily skin must be that of the chin.

Sankara comments on both of the texts last cited. In BrSBh 1. 2. 28-32 he discusses the term pradesa-matra with reference to AB 10. 6.1.11. In 28 he explains the expression ' he knows Him man-wise, existent in man' (pur?bsa-vidham purtese 'ntah prati$thitam) by saying that Badarayana's sak.sat, ; visibly,' ' manifestly,' or ' face to face,' refers to ' that likeness (or image, of Him) that is postulated or imagined ( prakrtarn . . . kalpitam) in those parts of man that are between (the top of) the head and the chin. In 29 he enunciates Smarathya's view that the span is mentioned because it is an epiphany (abEivyakti) that is the subject of the exposition. In 30 he expounds Badaris view that the 'span ' is mentioned as a basis of 'recollection' (anusmrti), i.e. as a sup- port of contemplation, and, he says, (that would be by the mind, based in the heart, " of the measure of a span " . . . (by the mind), since the IIighest Lord is not himself of any such circum- scrlption as to be manifested (vyajyate) by his connection with the heart . . . He is not of the " measure of a span." ' In 31 he reverts to Asvapati Saikeya's demonstration of the consor- tium or coincidence (sampatti) of the localised divinities in the pradesa-matra, as explained by Jaimini, and he repeats that the ' span ' referred to is that of the space between the top of the head and the chin, considered as analogous to the Three Worlds (terrestrial, aerial, celestial) of which the _ Vaisvanara-Purusa is the Self. iE inally, in 32, it is in the same way that the Jabalas refer to :Eim as present 'therein' (asmin), viz. in the space between the top of the head and the chin, and particularly ' in the unforsaken ) (avimukfam) n20 18 Bastiz-. vasti in AB 10. 6. 4. 5, 11.

JUB 3. 21. 3 where Vayu is ' never forsaken of the Gods' (anavas.rsto devanam); and for mqzc in this sense positively, KU 6. 10 ' when are aban- doned ( pramqboyante ) all the desires ( k&amp;mah ) that haunt in the heart,' cf.

In the first sense the Unforsaken is Benares (Varanasl) between the streams Varana and Asl, or hermeneutically Vara and Nasl, in which area those who die are assured of immor- tality and liberation; the former interpreted as 'avert- ing ' (v&amp;rayati) faults committed by the senses, the latter as 'destroying' (nasayati) sins committed by the senses,-as already implied in AV 4. 7. 1 vdr idom varay&amp;tai varondvatyam adhi, tatramtasydsiktom, tena te varaye v1sam, cf. AV 3. 13. 3 and CB 6. 1. 1.9. In the second sense the Unforsaken is represented by the area between the brows and above the nose, which is ' the meeting-place of the celestial and super-celestial worlds ' (dyaqxrlokasya parasya ca samdhih, JhbalaUp. 2); and just as in the BrahmaUp. the sannyast carries about his own sacred-thread ( the sutratman ) within him, so here the sannyast, knowing this 'Unforsaken,' carries it about with him wherever he goes and it matters not where he dies: for 'positing (avegga) the Breath wholly between the brows ( bhruvor rnad hye = avimqxkte) he attains to that Supreme Celestial Person,' BG 8. 10. ' Breath ' (praznah-xvev,ua): i. e: Brahma, as in AA 2. 3. 8. 5; 'wholly' because "therein all the Gods are unified ' ( ekam bhavanti, ib. 1, 2; prazne ekod ha bhavanti, Rau§Up. 4. 3 ) . With avimqxktam, as above, cf. the four Buddhist sabba btbddhflnam avijahita- tthdnani (notably one at the foot of the Bodhi-tree, and another the Jetavanarama, J. 1. 71, 94 ) . 21 This samdhi, conjunction, coincidence (represented in Buddhist iconography by the radiant urna) is that of the ' farther half ' (parardham) as distinguished from 'these worlds ' to which the Deus Absconditus returns (pratyavait) in SB 11. 2. 3. 3, cf. RV 1. 164.12 pare ardhe and upare . . . sapt-cakre; as represented analogically by the upper and lower halves of the head. This is the ' end of the sky, there sky and earth em- brace ' (JUB 1. 5. 5 ); that ' worlds' end ' ( aokass antom ) of which the Buddha says that ' there is no release from ill unless it be reached ' and after wllich the Freeman is called a ' World-ender ' ( lokantapu ), and ' knowing worlds' end by having obtained his quietus (samitavi = BG 6. 7 jitatmonah prasantasya) no more longs for this or any other world ' ( A 2. 48-49 ) . In terms of the In comment upon the CU passage Sankara says that pradesa-matra can refer either (1) to the space between earth and sky as represented by the extent of the whole body from head to feet, or (2) to the mouth by which food is eaten,22 or (3) to whatever is of the distance of the sky from the earth,23 or (4) to such extents as are referred to in treatises on the sky-world, etc., or (5) according to other schools 24 to the space between the top of the head and the chin. Aankaras exclusion of the fifth meaning in this context is because the ' span ' in question seems to be that of the whole body, i. e. a fathom; but in any case, the meaning ' dis- tance between earth and sky' (dyulokadi-prthivy- anta-pradesa parima.na) prevails; and it is quite impossible to agree with Dr. Scherman's remark, ' Auf Uankara's Erklarung dieser Spanne als " der Raum zwischen iHimmel und Erde " ist wohl kaum Rucksicht zu nehmen ' ! It is just this meaning that the logic of the context demands in RV 10. 90.1 where, if the reciter accompanied the words with gestures he would surely have pointed first to the earth and then with a sweep of his arm to the sky; in fact, 'it was by means of sky and earth that the Gods apprehended lIim (Agni), and it is by means of these two that even today he is apprehended' (AB 1.16). It is taken for granted even by those who render symbolism of the Cross this point between the ( hori- zontal) brows and above the (vertical) nose corresponds to ' the nail that joins the cross-tree (human nature) to the upright (the Word),' and that is 'the place of man's conversion and repentance' Acts of Peter, 38. 22 The mouth, with its ' roof ' and floor, upper and lower lips, upper and lower teeth (likened to the upper and nether millstones of the Soma-press ), and inter- vening ' space,' is also a likeness of the universe. 23 For example, as measured by the extent of the Sarasvatl, a journey of forty days * on horseback up- stream from the place where the river is lost in the desert to the Plaksa Prasravana (Fons Vitae), PB 25. 10. 16; or by the height of a thousand cows standing each on another, PB 16. 8. 6; the same, or a thousand leagues, or a thousand days journey by horse, or on foot (ib. 21.1. 9); or a thousand day's journey for the Golden Gander, AV 13. 2. 38; cf. AV 10. 8. 18, RB 8. 3 and 8, AB 2.17, Mil. 82. All these are pradesas, and as such faQons de parler, measures of the length of the Axis Mundi, ' Bridge ' or ' Pillar ' that at once divides and unites this and yonder worlds. 24 The Jaimimyas and Jabalas. * On the number 40, see the references cited by A.

It has been further suggested above that such a measure cannot refer either to the whole body of man, or to his heart, or to his eye, but could refer to his face or head, from the hair to the chin,- a prade£a that at the same time repre- sents the distance from sky to earth. A rather striking confirmation of this inference is to be found in the treatises on Talamana, or 'Icono- metry,' 95 where the term pradesc^, ' span,' is syn- onymous with tala, vitasti, etc., in so far as all these terms denote the length of the ' face ' (mukha) from the roots of the hair to the chin: with this distinction, however, that tctla is the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger, vitasti that from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the ring finger, and gokslrna that from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger,-a11 are ' spans.' The variation cor- responds to the fact that there are ten diferent canons, respectively appropriate to the nature of the persons to be represented. In some cases, when the representation is of deities, the length of the ' face ' is twelve ang?llas or ' inches,' but in the Uttama Asta Tala canon, the application of which is to representations of normal human beings, the 'face' has a length of ten angulas or inches. In other words, the human face is a dHanguMm. It must not be thought that the use of this exridence necessarily presupposes an already exist- ing iconometry of anthropomorphic cult images in the late Vedic period; such a thing is not impossible,2ff but let us take it for granted that there was no cult of anthropomorphic images then. It does not follow that there was no knowledge of the proportionate measurements of the parts of the human body, expressed in; inches,' etc.; and suc 1 measurements are implied by the word 26For present purposes it suffices to eite T. A. Gopinatha Rao, Talamana or Iconometry, Mem. Arch. Survey of India, No. 3, 39, 96 (Calcutta, 1920). 26 For the most recent diseussion see J. N. Banerjea, The Development of Hirwdu Iconopraphy ( Calcutta 1941 ), Ch. II. The Antiquity of Image-Worship in India. I am hardly convinced by Mr. BanerJea's arguments for a Vedie iconolatry,, although it is beyond question that many Vedic texts provide the s prescriptions' for the later ieonography. dxcDngulom itself, of which the somatic reference is undoubted. In any case there is to be found in the Brahmanas (our ' main help,' as Professor Zimmer used to satr, in the interpretation of Vedic hymns) an iconometry of the Fire-Altar in terms of ' inches,' etc., not of absolute length but repre- senting a unit derived from the actual body of the sacrificer; the Fire-altar, in all its complexity, is commensurate with the man for whom it is ediSed, and transforms him, at the same time that it represents both the whole of the universe and the reintegrated person of the Agrli-Vaisvanara-Purusa himself. 'He measures it by ;'fingers" (angu- libEir mimtte); for the Sacrifice being a Man [purusc^, on the one hand the AIan, and on the other 'this man, so-and-so,2 His counterpart or likeness], it is by him that everything is measured here;27 and these "fingers" of his are his least measure, which he thus secures for him; he mea- sures by twenty-four fingers . . . (and) by the man with outstretched arms . . . and thus secures for him what is his highest measure ' (AB 10. 2. 1.2-2.2.6, cf. 1.2.5.14, 1.3.2.1). One would naturally assume that such men- surations were employed in the edification of the Fire-altar already in the earliest Vedic period; and there is ample evidence of this in the fact that both the creation of the universe and the edification of the Sacrificean inverted mimesis of creation are refelTed to as acts of measure- ment. The verb is nta (whence mayas 'art' by which the mayil,n operates) 28 (with or without pre- 27 The notions of God and man as the ' measure / of all things, represented by the Altar. Cf.

It need hardly be remarked that NVhitney's obiter dictum, in comment on AV 10. 8. 9 + BU 2. 2. 4, to the effect that the equation of the Rsis with the Breaths is ' extremely implausible ' is absolutely negligible: it is equally useless to wonder why Keith discussing AA 1. 5. 2 + AV 10. 8. 9 (Aitoreya Jranyaka, 1909, 195) ealls the AV verse 'practically unintelligible,'-he himself remarks on AA 2. 2. 1 that ' this Khand. a shows the names of the seers of the Rgveda ean be dedueed from praPna's actions; for what is cited above is a mere fraction of what could be cited in proof of the equation of the Rsis, Maruts, Ravis, Breaths and Visve Devfih, Vasus, Rudras and Adityas all with one another. The Breaths, or powers of vision, etc., which we regard as our own, are really Prajapatifs 'breath-forms' (prana- qsp¢nt, BU 1. 5. 22; Sayana on RV 10. 90. 16, devah; prana vas devah . . . tes¢ paroksam juhoti,, TS 6. 4. 1. 5) ! and ' merely the names of His aets ' ( BU 1. 4. 7, ef.

They are his rays or glories, and surround him like a erown or nimbus, and choir or bodyguard, and like the branches of a tree in relation to its trunk, the spokes of a wheel in relatio to the nave, or rafters surrounding the roofplate.</page><page sequence="10">154 COOMSASWAMY: Rgveda 10. 90. 1 " aty atwthad dasang?zlam " but he is also above all tlle ' head ' of the sky, of the world, and of the sacrifice, i. e. of the cosmic Man, and as such surrounded by his s glories.' The Samhita texts are liturgical, and we cannot expect to find in them any detailed prescription for the mensuration of altars; and yet practically all that is developed in the Brahmana texts with which we have been and shall be concerned is already predicted and aforesaid in the Rks. Since it is as the God that the Cosmic Man is sacrificed (the Purusasukta is the purusamedha after which all other sacrifices are patterned), it may be assumed that a span of twelve fingers is employed in the mensuration of the altar, as implied in GB; on the other hand, the specific dasangulam of the hymn in which the deity is thought of as if in fact a man (with feet and head, eyes, ears, mouth and breath, purusa-vid- ham, purusa-rupena) seems to show, what is nothing extraordinary in itself, viz. that it had long been recognized that the length of a man's face amounted to a spaIl of ten inches, ten of his own finger-breadths. Assuming, then, that dasangulam is the same thing as the str.san of verse I (Sayana, s1,rsnah, straso dya?bh samavartata, cf. 10.121.1 iSiranyagarbha, the solar disc) how are we to translate ? Since it is impossible to express in a few English words the notion of a capital ex- tent that also corresponds to the distance between sky and earth, it seems best to retain the original 'ten inch (domain) ' explaining in a note that this refers macrocosmically to the distance between sky and earth and microcosmically to the space between the top of the head and the chin; strsan in RV being, as Grassmann says, v liopf, insbe- sonder 2) als Sitz der Geisteskraft und Tuchtig- keit ; cf. AV 9. S. 21 virat siras, and SB 1. 4. S. 5 'the head is the most glorious (srestham) part of anything,' cf. AB 2. I. 2. 8. I therefore collsider it shown that what RV 10. 90.1 sa bhiimtm vqsvato vrtvAty atisthad dasangulam means is that the Purusa, making the whole Earth his footstool, fills the entire universe, and rules over it by means of the powers of vision, etc. that proceed from his face, and to which man's own powers of vision, etc. are analogous; this face, whether of God or man, being, as es- plained in the cited Brahmana contexts, itself an image of the whole threefold universe. II That the Agni-Vaisvanara-Purusa is at the same time one Person and the unity of Seven Persons, as already implied by RV 8. 39. 8 saptv-manusa, and with special reference to the concentration of their powers in the head, is elaborated in many well known contexts in which both the universal Man and this man in his likeness are thought of as so constituted as to be at the same time a monarchy and a heptarchy. Perhaps the most important of these is that of GB 6.1.1.1-7 (referred to also in 9. 2. 3. blf.) where the Seven Rsis or Purusas, who were ' non- existent ' (asat) 30 prior to their kindling by Tndra, 3° ' Non-existent '; but at the same time desirous of, or ' seeking (ichantah) This (world), t'hey were stream- ing ( +/.rs ) with toil and heate whence their name of "Rsis "'; cf. AV 19. 41. 1 bhadram iahdnta .rwsayah ssarviWdas tdpo diksdrn upanfsedur apre, and the variant in TS 5. 7. 4. 3. A close analogy is provided by TB 2. 2. 9.1 where, hl the beginning, This (world) was naught at all, there was neither sky nor earth nor air, but ' that which was non-existent made up its mind to be' (tad asad eva san mano 'kuruta syarn iti). Asat is not 'a kind of being,' but (like abZtava, see HJAS 4. 132) a being not in any kind: as is explicit in CB 7.2. 1.7, ' What " is not " is that which is uncharacterised ' (yad vai nasts tad alaksanam ) . It is precisely from this point of view that Meister Eckhart speaks of the ' non- existence ' of the Godhead, and says that ' before man was, God was not.' Descriptions, then, of deity, That One ( tad ekam ), as ntruktanirukta vyaktavyakta, murta- murta, etc. are as much as to say sadasat; and we see that in this expression, as applied, for example to Agni in RV, asat by no means denotes an absolute non-entity (an out b^, like 'the son of a barren womall') but the in-sistent potentiality of ex-istence sadasat representing the Supreme Identity of potentiaiity and act in That One in whom there is no procedure from potentiality to act and of whom alone it can be said with truth, 'No sooner said than done,' as in Genesis, where ' Let there be light ' is itself the act of illumination. The necessity of employing both an affirmative and a negative theology (as in MU 4. B) is imposed by the concept itself according to which That One is sadasat, one essence of two natures, characterised and uncharacterised, saguna and nirgurza. That s non-existence' may be either an absolute privation of all pr3ssible reality, or a condition of rela- tive privation (as in the case of the iE2sis who are still in potestia, still inhibited ), or the state of freedom from all afflrmative delimitation, all being in any mode of existence ( as in the case of the krtakrtyah whose tasks are all done), underlies the apparent contradiction of RV l0.72.2 asatah sad ajayata by CU 6.2.1,2 (cf. BG 2. 16 and Eankara, Svatmantrt4pana 77-79- Empe- docles eK re wyap oV8a,ut O'VJOS d,uXxavor br PyevetaOat rT] )- The RV formula (identical with Laodz', in the Tao-Td</page><page sequence="11">COO]IBASWAME: Rgveda lo. 90. 1 " aty atiathad dGang?sla7n " 155 the Breath (pranak ), are identified with the Breaths (pranah) and allotted to the whole body, strictqb senso, but what their ichor (rasa, sap or vital fluid) and their (royal) glory (sm) was, that they concentrated in his, the Purusa's, Agni's, Prajapati's head (siras), so called because the Breaths are glories (sriya&amp;, cf. AA 2.1. 4); and since it was to his head that ' the Several-Deities ' (visve deva&amp;, here = the Breaths) resorted (srttah, cf. RV 10. 82. 6 and AV 10. T. 38), it is there that offering should be made to them; the same analogies apply to the aviform body of the Fire- altar, of which the F;re himself is the head; and so Agni-Prajapati is at the same time one entire Purusa and the unity of seven Purusas. In GB 9. 3. 1. 1-13, when the whole Person of the UnixTersally-human iFire has thus been rein- tegrated, all that has been said about the 'head ' is ritually enacted by an of;Tering of pancakes; one, representing the Universally-human head itself, and seven representing the Maruts, or seven Breaths; and the latter are so placed on the first as to represent the two ears, two eyes, nostrils and Ching, Ch. 40), deriving the existent from that which i8 not yet existent, corresponds to the Scholastic esc nihitlo fit, notably in St. Thomas Aquinas' definition of creation as the ' emanatio totius esse ex non ente, quod est nihil ' (Sum. Theol. 1. 45. 1) and Philo's 3t rou ,uXq ovros eZs rb ezval . . . rbv Koa,uov avefrave, Moses 2.267); in RV asat (=uttanapod in verse 4, Grassmann (Weltmutter') is ,uXq dv, an unlimited maternal possibility very far indeed from an absolute unreality, while in CU asat is an OUK or o0da,Us dv or impossibility of existence. This is the situation, that the Rsis ( Maruts, Breaths, All-Gods etc. ), ante principium, are engaged in the primordial, creative, sacrificial session ( sattra ) by which the sky and earth are divided and universal room is made for the actualisation of all latent potentialities. Upanisedtbh in AV 19. 41.1 corresponds to Vpa sedur indram in RV 10.73.11 and upa tva stdan in 1.65.2, upa sedur agre in TS 5: 7. 4. 3; upasad as a besieging and victory in AB 1. 23, 24; and in the same sense to JUB 4. 14. 6 where the Rsis, undertaking a session or siege (sattra) sromena tapaw . . sndram ava rtsrtbd- hire, i. e. ' beset him, Indra, with their toiling and their ardor.' These are valuable indications for the conno- tations of 'Upanisad,' a term already in BD 4. 63 applied to certain of the Vedic hymns; the development is from the exercise of a certain pressure or compulsion upon the person by those who ' sit up aaainst him ' to that which is finally won from him; and this is closely paralleled in that of Lat. tntimus, ' secret,' ' profound' from intimare, to put or press into anything; a not altogether inadequate translation of tspaniZsad would be ' intimation,' somewhat in the sense that Wordsworth speaks of 'intimations of immortality.' mouth; the one Vaisvanara cake representing the Regnum (ksatra) and the seven others the Commons (vis), and at the same time-'yonder Sun ' and his seven rays,-those rays which ' being hypostasised ' (pratyavasthitah) in all his children become our powers of speech, thought, vision, etc. (JUB 1.28, 29) so that it can be said that 'all these deities are in me' (JUB 1.14.2, cf. AV 11. 8.14). Looking out of the windows of my face, my dslsangulam, they bring their tribute (balim haranti, passim) of nourishment to me, so that I too, in my solar Person, 'rise up by food. And with the jovial, literally dyu-, " celestial," face of the Person in the Sun, to which our own face corresponds, everyone is familiar in the hier- atic and folk arts of the whole world. Finally, in BU 2. 2. 3, 4 the head is an inverted bowl, round which are seated the Seven R$is, with the Yoice (vac) as eighth; and these seven, as being ' the universal form of glory ' (yaso vis- varupam) are again identified with the Breaths, of which the openings are the ears, eyes, nostrils and mouth, as in AV 10. 2. 6 and in AA 1. S. 2 where also there are seven Breaths in the head, with the voice as eighth, 'not mingled with the others.' The names of the P.;sis equated with the powers of vision, etc. are given; and indeed, as remarked by S:eith in comment on AA 2. 2. 1 ' the names of the seers of the P;veda can be deduced from prcinan's actions.' III TIardly any, if any detail of the ontology and psychology outlined above is peculiarly Indian; everything can be paralleled elsewhere. Here I shall only adduce the parallel to the words aty atisthad dasangulam that (if the foregoing ex- planation is accepted) is presented in Genesis 2. 7 ' breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.' If we bear in mind that what was thus ensouled was, in the first place, nothing but a lifeless shape moulded of that very dust that 'returns to the dust' when the spirit returns to God who gave it (Eccl. 12. 7, cf. Job 34. IS) then, in the light of MU 2. 6 where the Purusa's, Prajapati's oSspring are compared to unawakened, unbreathing (apranah ) stocks and stones until he, ' Inaking of himself the gale n (vayq- rrorB, qrvev), enters into them to arouse them, what the words of Genesis imply are that God 'formed the body of man from the dust of</page><page sequence="12">156 COO3IARASWAMY: RggeX 10. 90. &amp; aty atisthad hsangulam the ground, and breathed into its nostrils the breath of life [pranah], and so the Man [purusa] became a living-soul [jtvatman].' As interpreted by Philo, this ( breathing into the face ' is an endowment of man with a portion (otpa) or scin- tilla (a7ro(r7rac,L4a) 31 0 the Etherial Spirit and whole divi-ne nature, a 'portion' corresponding to the amrtasya bhagam of RV 1.164. 21, 37. In ourselves the Mind (rors- manas, as often iden- tified with Prajapati), as the leader of the sensitive soul and as the 'Man' in everynzan, occupies a position analogous to that of the Great Ruler of the whole world (Opf. 69), and through this Mind CIod extends the powers that proceed from himself until they reach their sensible objects, the 'succumbent' (U7roJceterov, LA. 1. 30, that is, 7a amr#7/ra, sensibilia, visayah, rupani, namariipe); 3° fl I'hilo, LA 3. 161 e de fVX71 a@epos vrf;J, arro¢1rour,aa aef ov . . . asaepeou f v¢eevs ,aoz^pa. For the notion of this scintilla aqzimae ( one of Meister Eckhart's favorite phrases, and cf. Dante, Paradiso 7. 5 ' ardendo in s scintilla ' and Marsilio Ficino, Comm. rn convivrurn Platonis de Amore 5. 5 ' in illo . . . divini decoris scintilla vis illa divina ' ) see W. Eobhouse, William Law, pp. 11, 51, 85, 135, 250, 348. Cf. note 36. The corresponding t3kr. root is sphur in sphulinga, etc. There can be cited numerous texts to the efFect that the Breaths and all things are outflung like sparks from the fiery prima rota: e. g. MaitriUp. 6. 24 ( Brahma ) alata-cakram iva sphurantam and 6. 28 vahnes ca yadvat visphulinga . . - tathaiva tasya pranadayah, and simi- larly BU 2. 1. 20 yathagneh ksudra visphtulinga qgyqbc- caranty, evam evasmad atmanah sarve prana h, sarve lokah, sarve d evah, sarvani bhutani vyuccaranti, and the variant in KausUp. 3. 3 yathagner jvalatah visphqb- lingah vipratiostherarL, evam evaitasmed atmanah pranah, etc. ' The mythology of the Gnostical systems, tooJ recog- nizes in the pleroma [Vedic purnam] dramatic processes in which particles of the light of the aeons are driven out and fall into the emptiness. In the same manner, Luria accounts for the fall of the " divine sparks of light " from the divine realm into the lower depths ': the converse process, FikkurL, being that of the ' up- lifting of the fallen sparks ' and their restoration to their source (G. G. Scholem, 1. c. 264-307 ) ,yasmin punar ekam bhavarLtz!

A. A. Luce, Immaterialism, Proc. British Acad. 30 ( 1944 ), and Rene Guenon, Le regne de la quantite, 1945. We do, however, also find matra and these powers are the servants and bodyguard (80Prfopo) of the Mind to which they bring their findings (Opif. 139). It is, then, 'in the face,' the noblest part of the body, that God inwrought the sensitive powers (awSrusn LA 1. 39, the tndrtyant) for which the face is 'pierced' (xawra -TETp5TGL, Skr. Vtrd as in AV 10. 2. 6 khani v tatarda, etc.) 33 with seven openings (LA 1.12), ( BU 4. 3. 9 ), the etymologieal equivalent of materia, used in the only proper sense of ' matter ' (i. e. ' materia seeunda ') to denote that whieh has dimensions and has in faet, been 'measured out' or 'made' (nirmata). 33 From the same root, Vedie Trtsu. The Trtsavah, i. e. Vasistha and other priests of King Sudas, whom Indra befriends, are doubtless the Rsis or Breaths in and by whom the Sacrifice is eelebrated. The whole problem of these khd nt, eonduits or ehannels, the niskhatah panthah of the Breaths ( JUB 4. 24. 9, ef. Philo Agr. 97 dpvoy,MafY 71 xaff,aasv . . . Twv aF87)ew^), has been eonfused by a failure to reeognize that the khani of the Rgveda and those of the Upanisads are the same, and failure to reeognize the symbolism of irrigation aeeording to whieh these dug-out paths are the doors or sluiees through whieh the streams of eon- seiousness flow as from a eommon souree. The ' first referenees ' to the seven openings of the powers of per- eeption and aetion are not those of AV 10. 8. 9 (or 10. 2. 6) as Keith maintained (Aitareya Jrnyaka, 195, note 13 tl9091 ) but in RV passim, where it is usually Indra (i.e. qua solar Breath) that releases the 'seven rivers ' that had been Varuna's (8. 69.12, ef. AV 3. 13. 1, 2 ) or Vrtra's ( passim ), and it is obvious that the khani, like the streams, must have been sqven. So RV 2. 15. 3 khiny at.rtrnars nadXnaXrn ( = stndhunam else- where) and similar expressions in RV eorrespond to AV 10. 2. 6 kah sapta khini vt tatarda s2rsani? and EU 4. l khani vyatrnat (where again the number is unspeeified, though the reference is unquestionably to the seven Breaths). AV 10. 2. 6 eontinues karaldv imX ndsike cakeant mukham, and this is perfeetly intelligible, imau implying a deietic reference to the pairs of ears, nostrils and eyes. For at.rnan quoted from RV in TS 2. 3. 14. 5, Keith's ' crushed ' is quite as unintelligible as the expres- sions ' cursed,' ' injured,' ' damned,' or ' doomed' eited by Rawson in connection with KU 4.1 atrnat (Katha Upanisad, 149 [19341 ): Rawson himself (p. 148) has ' pierced the senses outward,' but the khaniz are the doors of the senses not the senses themselves, and all that Sankara means by hizmsitavin etc. is what is implied by refsveev ddov-secare viam, to make one's way, not to destroy it! It iS in fact, from the curse that the in- hibited streams are released ( RV 1. 93. 5 ) . Rawson at the same time, discussing avrtta caksus ('in-staring') completely belies Plato who (like Ruml, Tauler, Boehme, Blake, etc. ) in fact commends those studies ' that compel the soul to turn its vision inward ' (Rep. 526E, cf. Phaedo 83B); which is only pertinent in the present connection because it illlplies the eom- pletion of the cycle of experience by a closing up again</page><page sequence="13">COOMARASWAMY: Rgveda 10. 90.1 aty atisthad dasangularn 157 those of the two eyes, ears, nostrils and mouth, which are the seven essential parts of the head of the doors of perception, although, as Meister Eckhart says, ' anyone who turns within before his sight is clear will be repelled, for this light blinds weak eyes.' If the identification of the Rsis with the seven Breaths, or of the latter with the seven Rivers seems strange to us, it is mainly, if not only, because the traditional psychology and the concept of ' streams of consciousness ' are ullfamiliar to usy who are swept away and now well- nigh drowned by them ( cf. MU 3. 2; Timaeus 43 B ) . In the first place, however, the word rsi itself derives from /rs, to ' rush,' and with respect to fluids, to ' flow'; in RV 8. 94. 7 where the Maruts ' rush ' (arsanti) Sayana rightly calls them 'Rsi-Maruts.' Not only, indeed, are the Rsis and Maruts repeatedly and expressly identified with the Breaths and specifically with the seven Breaths in the head of the reintegrated Agni Vaisvanara, whose head is also the Sun with his seven Rays ( for all of which the references have been cited ), but these Rays by which we see, hear, etc. are actually still called 'rivers' (sizndhavah) in JUB 1.28. 8, 9, and Vac a ' stream ' ( kulya, ib. 1. 58. 3, cf. CB 6. 1. 1. 9 and Timaeus 75 E zb 8&amp; XoPyzv . . . peov). RV 2. 11. 8, where the roaring torrents of rain ' distribute Indra's blast ' ( dhamanim) is echoed in CU 3. 19. 2 ya d hamanayas ta nad yah ( Cankara, d ehe . . . sirah ); and similarly RV 1. 85. 10 where the Maruts ' play the flute ' ( d harnanto vanarn ) in Prasna Up. 2. 5 where bana-sa7ora, cf. AV 10. 2. 17 and AA 5. 1. 4 where bamna and vana = na (harp) in the sense of AA 3. 2. 5 'this divine harp' (daivt vtna), viz. the body, and, as Keith justly remarks, ' this explains Prasna Upanisad II. 2.' Maruts and Breaths alike are ' songsters,' and if the Breath is called a ' sounding ' (nadah) in AA 1. 3. 8, this is again an allusion to the rushing rivers, called nadyah because they ' roared ' (anadata) whell they descended at the slaying of Vrtra (AV 3. 13. 1; TS 5. 6. 1. 2): and ' then, indeed, I see, yea also hear [etc.], when their roar (ghosa) and their voice (vic) reaches me.' So far, all this is nothing but the particular Indian form of the universal assumption that we are the instruments of the Spirit, on which it plays, harmon- iously if we cooperate but stridently if we resist ( cf. Plato, Laches 188 D, ,uovatKos; Plutarch, Mor. 404 B AvxX 8' opSyavor 8sov; Philo, Spec. 4. 49, SIut. 139; Boehme, Sig. Rer. 16). 3, 7 ' as an organ of divers sounds and various notes . . . but one air or breath in all, which sounds in each note or pipe according as the instrument or organ is made ' ) . In the Upanisads the conduits of the Breaths are usually called nadlyah, ' pipes,' or hitah, ' allocations ' (for the references see Eaas in Hume, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, 519, 521 [ 1934] ) .* These ducts, which are * In BU 4. 2. 3 what ' flom7s ' (asravati) in these ducts is, according to Cankara, that subtle food that nourishes the subtle, i. e. mental body, i. e. the reports of the senses; hence in JaWina psychology, the seven asravas or psychic ef- and in-fluences, and in Buddhism the asavas or ' fluxes,' freedom from which is a sine qua non of Arahatta, the Arahant being khtnasava and anasava. (Opif. 119) and correspond to the seven directions of motion (Opif. 122, LA 1. 12; cf. Timaet4s 34A not veins, eorrespond exaetly to the bodily 7ropot through whieh the soul is disseminated (7rape^7rap,uevr1) and feels and suffers aeeordingly ( Aziochus 366 ); the eoneept goes baek at least to Alkmaion (ea. 500 B. C.) for whom, as A. H. Blakeney says (Awiochus, 46 [London, 1937]) 'the 7ropot were a physiologieal expression denoting the passages along whieh sensations reaeh the heart.' A ' pipe ' may be either a eonduit of air, as in RV 10. 135. 7 where nalih is ' flute,' and in the expression gala nadt, 'gullet'; or of water, as in AV 10.7.15 'pipes (aque- duets, ehannels ) of the Sea assembled in the WIan ' (samudro, yasya nadyah pibruse 'dhi samPhit&amp;h, ef. VS 34. 55 sapta .r$aya71 protihitah sarire): and these ' pipes ' are surely the same as the ' dug-out pathways, tribu- taries [in hoth senses of the word], these Breaths,' JUB 4. 24. 9 ) . The symbolism throughout is one of irrigation and eultivation: Indra is tlle apUm netr- (RV 2.12. 7, ef. 7. 47. 4 indro aradat gaturn . . . te s1ndhavah and 49. 1, 4 tndro yO . . . rarEda t po devtr iha mOm avantu ), or Agni net stndhinarn ( 7. 5. 2 ), in the same sense tllat the Sun is so often said to ' lead forth ' (pra.ns) the Breaths; the Devah severally (Agni, Vayu, Aditya and Visve Devatah ) are similarly apam netara . . . anrui- dyaya, JUB 1. 34. 6, 11. ' Mind (rnanos) is the pool ( hrad ah, that hrada in mrhieh the inveterated Cyavana's youth was renewed at his desire, CB 4.1. 5.12, and the devadaha of J 1. 52) of all desires [i. e. the eosmie 'wishing well'], and Voiee (vac) its stream' (kulya), and ' even as men lead forth water from a pool by means of a stream, even so the Cantor leads it from the Mind by means of the Voiee to the Saerifieer whose wishes he fulfills ' ( JUB 1. 58. 3, 4, ef. Philo, LA 28 ) . When, then, in the Atharvan hymn addressed to the Waters ( AV 3. 13 ) we find ' May they reaeh me, to- gether with Breath (prena, eomm. cak$uradina ' with vision and the rest of the powers') and with splendor ( varcasa ) . . . .

' Scripture was spoken from the begillning only to those who understand.... We must therefore occupy ourselves not with the expression, but with the meaning ' (Clement of Alexandria, Stromata 6. 15, 16) .

Jritah (5Jsri as in sarman, sarana, sam-o-saranam etc. ) is primarily ' leaning,' ' impending,' s sloping,' 'tending towardsr' as rafters rest against the roof-ridge or roof-plate to which they converge and in which they are synthesised.

Architecturally, the circumambient dependents crown and glorify their central principle of which they are the radii, rays, or ribs; ' that Brahma-splendor is surrounded by glory ' (sriya parivrddham, JUB 4. 24. 11), the Sun in turn es:tending to the Gods, the Rsis, their Glory (;ra) when they sang unto him and so upheld him (JUB 1.55#4- 9 ),-just as, in a domed house the roof-plate ( repre- senting the sun) and the rafters (as it were his rays) support one another, or as a king and his ministers cooperate (J 3.317-319, cf. JAOS 50.239). For further details of the architectural symbolism see my Pali kansika = Circular Roofplate, JAOS 50 (1930); Eck- stein, Specqbaum 14 (1939); Sunkiss, JAOS 60 (1940); Symbolism of the Dome, I#Q 14 ( 1938 ); and Some Sources of Buddhist Iconography, B. a.

The Breaths are at the same time hitah (pp. either of o/dha, to placey or +/hi, to send forth, impel; with the literal sense of ' dike ' in Manu 9. 274) in the same sense that the Maruts, the ' subjects ' or ' commons ' ( vw ) of the Gods are delegated or appointed powers (hitO iva . . . vibhiitagah RV 1. 166. 3, 8,11, cf. AA 2. 1. 7, Cvet. Up. 3. 21, BG 10. 40, 41 ), and just as Agni, the bestower of the ' Seven Treasures ' (saptd stna) in every house, is hito hitesu ( RV 5. 1. 5 ) with reference ( 1 ) to the placing of the Fire amongst the logs on household hearths where the Agnihotra is outwardly performed and (2) to the Fire amongst the Breaths in the human house (body), inhabited by the Gods who ' made the mortal their home, and entered into man ' (AV 11. 8. 18) and the place where the Internal Agnihotra is performed. The Breaths are hitah, again, in the sense that the Breath is hitah, his members (gani, cf. JUB 1.48.3 sojatA angani, BU 1. 3. 19 Breath as anpanam rosah; and membra in Paradiso 2. 134) Jupahitah (AB 6. 1. 2. 14^15). Their ' appointment ' is to their ' stations ' (yat7X- yotarvam, AA 2. 4. 2; stMnesqx, AvetUp. 5. 11) in due order (yatha kramena, MU 6.31). Taking hitah from /dha-, a secondary sense is that of 'friends' (cf. sokhi and sakhayah often in RV of Indra and the Maruts), appropriate because the Breaths are the ' own men' (ssah), 'allies' (stapayah), 'home-men' (gayah) and 'tributaries' (balihrtah) of their Overlord the Breath, Sun, Indra, Agni, Brhaspati or Prajapati as pmnv dhipats, pmna-sarvra-netr, ganarem ganapatih, Re2: An- gelorum.

These are, likewise, the ' seven sons ' of the Sun (RV1.164.1),i.e.the SevenRays of the Sun, for 'the Sun's rays are his sons ' (JUB 2. 9. 10, cf. 2. 5. 8; Nirukta 4. 26), the Visve Devah (!AB 3. 9. 2. 6, 4. 3.1. 27), the Maruts (AB 3. 9.1.18) the Breaths (pranadayah, MU 6. 26 and 31); as equated with the Sadhya DevRh (AB 10. 2. 2.1-5). With these rays, too, the righteous departed are identified (§B 1. 9. 3.10)- ' Then shalt thou back into thy Centre fall, a conscious Ray of that eternal All' (Mantiqu't- Tair, tr. iFitzgerald) for 'Under the theory of procession by powers, souls are described as rays ' (Plotinus, Enneads 6. 4. 3 ) .37 originally ' etherial ' source of the flame seems to survive in the miraculous kindling of the pyre, accomplished by the brahmtyan, and a proof of his superior Brahman- hood, in TS 2. 5. 8, cf. Mahavagga 1. 20. 13, cf. Philo, Moses 2. 154, 155 'Whether the flame was an etherial spark ( at@epos arro¢lra¢fia, see Note 31 ) . . . that fell upon the altar . . . untouched by the fire of daily use.' I have undertaken elsewhere a comparative study of the Greek and Indian concepts of Ether ( Skr. akasa, implying rather light than fire, but identical with atAqlp as quintessentia ) and shall only cite here the equations of Ether with Zeus and Indra: JUB 1.31.1 sa yas sa akasa tndra eva sah, Heracleitus fr. 30 atApsos Asos, Aeschylus fr. 34 Zevs e¢rlv a£@Xp, Euripides fr. 386 rord' t7rerpov a£@dpa . . . SrovSror vo,t4tte Zi1ra and, the soul being a 'portion of Ether ' (Philo LA 3. 161, see Note 31), Azochus 366, on the yearning of the soul for her native (¢v,t40vX0s) celestial Ether ' for ever reaching out towards life there, and for the choral dances.' In any case, the kindling of fire is analogous to the kindling of life. 'Kindled,' i. e. 'brought to life,' is particularly appropriate in connection with the Breaths, since these are (like the Maruts, RV 2.34.1, 3.26.4) fires ( agnayah) or measures of fire ( tejo-matrah) themselves ( cf. my Measures of Fire, O Instst1bto 100 [Coimbra 1942] ). It is in and by means of these powers, these sensible fires, functioning as household priests, that one sacrifices the sensibilia metaphysically: visayan . . . tndrsyagnis1b juhvatz, BG 4. 26, pra/na var deva . . . tesx parokwam juhotz, TS 6. 1. 4.5. Cf. Note 31. 37 The doctrine of the Seven Rays of Agni or the Sun is fundamental and universal, and underlies the icono- graphy of the six-armed cross, six-spoked wheel, and that of the circle filled by six peripheral and one central smaller circles. It is repeatedly enunciated throughout the Vedic tradition, notably, for example, in AB 1. 9. 3. 16 and 2. 3. 1. 7, with Mahidhara's commentary; of the Seven Rays of the Sun mentioned in RV 1. 105. 9, 2. 5. 2 and AV 7.107.1 (and elsewhere), six correspond to the directions of space and the seventh and best, or supreme light ( pararn bhd ) is the clisk (mondala) of the (3un The concept of the ' Seven Men ' has equivalents elsewhere. For example, in the Hermetica 1.16, 17 there are Seven Administrators, whose admin- istration is called Destiny, and whose character inheres in the Man. Similarly in the Testamen- tum Reuben, ch. 2, ' Seven spirits (rvfvSTa) were given (to man) at the creation, to do all his works himself, Hiranyagarbha, Prajapati or Indra. References to the Sun himself as this ' highest light ' abound: so RV 1. 50. 10 suryam . . . jyotir 1bttamam, 1. 113. 1 sre.sthom jyotisam jyotts ('most glorious Light of lights'), TS 1. 6. 6. 1 rasmmam sresthah; and this highest light is the Janua Coeli, moksa doara,at param attbhats . . . tom abhyattmucyate, JUB 1. 30. 4,-' I am the door ' (John 10. 7). These rays determine as many regions, which can be regarded either as spatial or temporal, and each with its proper qualities. As Clement of Alex- andria says, 'there proceed from God, the heart of the world, indefinite extensionsy upwards and downwards, to right and left, backward and forward. Looking in these six directions, as at a constant number, he com- pletes the creation of the world, of which he is the beginning and the end. In him the six phases of time have their end, and it is from him that they receive their indefinite extension. And that is the secret of the number seven.' And so, as Luc Benoist, from whom I cite the foregoing, says, ' les six directions de l'espace manifestent, suivant le symbolisme de Clement d'Alex- andrie, la presence simultanee des six jours de la crea- tion, le septieme etant le jour du repos, du retour au centre et au principe ' (Art dqb Monde, 3rd ed., 63 [Paris, 1941], --a summary of the Stromata 6. 16 on the 'seventh day'). Needless to say that the symbolism of the domed roof or the wheel is the same as that of the circle with its radii whichy like the rays of the sun, are indefinitely numerous, but with reference to the three-dimensional nature of space naturally six. St. Bonaventura's dictum is familiar, that God is a circle of which the centre is everywhere and circumference nowhere; and such a circle of light, posited against a background of darkness, better than any other symbol represents the totality of the finite-infinite ( parfrnAitaparimitam ), or shown-unshown (vyaktavgaktam). In HJAS 1. 45 I have shown how such a circle with its radii and concentric peripheries exhibits the doctrine of exemplarism and illustrates the extension of the many from the simple unity in which the multiple possibilities inhere. It is precisely in this sense that St. Thomas Aquinas sees in the undimensioned centre or unextended point (Skr. bindu) an image of the divine omniscience and omnipotence: ' If anyone were able to know intimately the whole mystery of the central point in a sphere, he would see in this simple point the origin of all the radii, and the distinctions of every terminus of the possible infinity of radii. It is thus, say some of the Scolastics, that God in his simplicity knows the possible infinity of beings and sees in his own essence the origin, the exemplary cause, the final cause, the idea of each of these eSects, of each of the radii of his crea- tive omnipotence' (De principio screntiae Dei, 14, cited</page><page sequence="16">COOMARASXVABIY: Rgredo ]0. 90. 1 " aty atisthad dasangulam " 160 . . . spirits of life, sight, hearing, Wsmell, taste, generation, and as eighth the spirit of sleep,' and when the man sleeps, the rest depart [cf. AB 3. 2. 2. 23, 1 O. S. 2. 1 S]: Eisler identifies the Seven with the ' sieben nach stoischen Lehre vom Herzen bzw. dem 1yvovLecov der Seele als Luftstrome nach den betreffenden Geisteswerkzeugen fliessenden Seelenteile, bestehend aus den funf Sinne, dazu Zeugungskraft und Sprachvermogen,' 38 a group- ing met with also in the Upanisads and in Philo. Perhaps even closer is the concept of the sevenfold Ahura Mazda; the Seven Amesha-spentas are one mind, one speech, one deed, and their one father and captain is Ahura Mazda.39 Philo, in LA I. 26, discussing Genesis 2. 6, enunciates what sounds like a translation or para- phrase of JUB I. 58. 3, 4: ' Mind is the pool of all desires, and Voice its stream ' and ' even as men lead forth water from a pool by meaIls of a stream, so the Cantor leads it from the Mind by means of the Voice to the Sacrificer '; what Philo says is that the Mind is called a ' spring ' and the senses a ' face,' because Nature [i. e. Natura natu- rans, Creatrix universalis, Deus] ' exercising fore- thought (vr,oo,uSovueve7)40 in all things assignedthis place to them as the most suitable for their specific activities: and the Mind, like a spring, waters the senses, sending to each of them the streams suit- able to it.' Similarly Peter Sterry: 'The Spirit is the Fountain of Life, which flows forth from God to Feed, and Maintain the Breath o-f Life in by A. Gratry, Logic, 327 tEnglish edition, Chicago, 1944] )- At the same time the number seven eonsidered in connection with the necessary triplicity of any extent (whieh must have a beginning, middle, and end, or earth, air, and sky) establishes the twenty-one-foldness of the whole universe, the Sun himself being the tventy-first from here, and what is beyond him a twenty-seeond (AB 8.4.1.12, CU 2.10.5, ete.); the proeession of the Rivers themselves being therefore at the same time seven- and three-fold (RV 10. 75. 1 ) . Cf. also Note 21, and Rene Guenon, Le symbolisme de la croiac. 38 R. Eisler, Orphiseh-Dionysisehe Mysteriexl-Gedanken in der Christliehen Antike, Vortrage der Bib. Warburg, 2. 87 ( 1922-1923 ) . 39 See Yasht 19.15 and 23-290 in SBE 4. 4° Regarding the discussions of Prometheus, Frpo,uSeLa, and Skr. +/math in pra-manthana, I renture to suggest that the senses ' churn ' ( kindle ) and ' learn ' coincide in the common root, cf. CvetUp. 2. 6 agnir yatrdbEi- «nathyate . . . tatra sam jdyate manah. We still some- times think of study as a ' grind.' the Body. When the time of Death comes, this Spirit draws back to their Head [i.e. source] again Those Streams of Life by which it went forth into the Body.' 41 Sterry's last sentence cor- responds exactly to the doctrine enunciated in BU 4. 4. 1-3: sa [Brahma, Atman] etas tejomatrah samabEyadadanah . . . atmanans lbpasamEarati, and BG 2. 58: sarnharate . . . indriyani; and this withdrawal is really the denouement or caTaxrr,oo+72 of life's drama (upasamErti, Dasarupa I. 36. 96), the rite of which Death is the avabErta ( CU 3. IT. 5 ) - ' unum ex vitae officiis, mori ' ( Seneca, Ep. 77 ad fin.). Finally, I cite from an early Irish source (as only one of many striking Indo- Irish parallels) a description of the voftas 7rVyr5: 49 'The fountain which thou sawest, with the five streams out of it, is the Fountain of Knowledge, and the streams are the five senses through which knowledge is obtained. And no one will have knowledge who drinks not a draught out of the fountain itself and out of the streams. The folk of many arts are those who drink out of them both.' 43 In conclusion, I think that it has been shown not only that the Vedic dasangulAns is really a designation of the Face of God, but also that the Vedic psychology of the Sevenfold Man and his Face is not in any exclusive sense an Indian doc- trine but much rather the Indian form of a tradi- tional psychology of which the expressions are to be found almost everywhere, and that becomes the more intelligible the more we realise its univer- 41 V. de Sola Pinto, Peter Sterry, Platonist and Puritan, 156-157 ( 1934 ) . 42 Philo's expression, Ft4g. 97.
