<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Newenham Summerson A SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY We are grateful to the President and Fellows of the British Academy for allowing us to reprint Sir Howard Colvin's bibliography of Sir John Summerson, published as an appendix to his obituary in the Proceedings of the Academy, 90, I996. The reprint has been generously sponsored by a grant from the SirJohn Soane's Museum Society. Editor This is an expanded version of the bibliography provided by Summerson himself for the Festschrift of 1970. Not only did that not cover the last twenty-four years of his life, but it omitted several publications of an earlier date that deserved inclusion. Use has been made of a copy of the I970 bibliography in Sir John Soane's Museum to which Summerson made additions up to I990. Like the I970 bibliography this one is 'select' in the sense that it excludes ephemeral journalism and some minor reviews of books, building and exhibitions. Books, articles and reviews are listed under each year in that order. I927 Measured drawing of the London, County and Westminster Bank, Lothbury (by C. R.
