<plain_text><page sequence="1">GREEK ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE SHORES OF THE BLACK SEA The Black Sea was one of the richest colonising areas exploited by the Greeks from the later seventh century on. Their cities have been well explored, and many of them quite well published, but the last detailed survey of the archaeological and other evidence which they offer was Minns's great Scythians and Greeks published in I913. Since the Revolution Russian archaeologists have paid more attention to the archaeology of other periods and areas of their country, but the Greek cities have not been neglected, and, particularly since the Second World War, major BULGARIA The Greek colony ofApollonia Pontica lay on the island of St Kiriak, near modern Sozopol, but there have been finds also on the nearby peninsula (Attia) and from Sozopol Bay itself.

Reports and studies of finds appear quickly and are of a very high standard. Detailed annual clay berries attached to it.

Callatis is effectively hidden by modern Mangalia and hitherto only the cemetery area north and north- west of the town had been explored and fourth- century and Hellenistic graves excavated. Rebuilding within the town in 1959-6o0 gave the opportunity for more detailed study of the ancient city. A cemetery area immediately north of the ancient city wall yielded several tombs, of considerably differing types, including contracted burials in pit-graves, child burial in amphorae, stone-built and tile graves, and cremation pits. The finds are largely of the fourth to second centuries B.C. and include Attic red-figure pottery, alabastra, gilt clay reliefs and figurines. One remarkable tomb complex (Fig. 2), of which the principal burials are fourth-century in date, comprises a rectangular stone monument (12 X 6 m.) enclosing three cremation pits, and a stone-lined cist within an oval tumulus (I3"5 x 14-2 m.) outlined with stone slabs (Fig. 3).

The site is now virtually cut off from the sea by a series of mudbanks and lagoons. Originally it may have been a peninsula site of the type favoured by the Greeks, or perhaps no more than a low hill in the coastal plain (Fig. 4). Beneath the Roman- Byzantine citadel occupying the low hill which must always have been the heart of the city, the excavators have come upon the foundations of a small temple (Fig. 5), dated by finds of Chian amphorae of the early fifth century which were buried complete and in- verted beneath its floor.

Across Sector X ran a Hellen- istic ditch and traces of the defence wall which ac- companied it. Of the same period are deep founda- tions, cut for houses and filled with neat alternating layers of clay and crushed rubble. These would have stabilised the construction in a low-lying, perhaps marshy area, and similar measures have been observed at Olbia, in S. Russia. Between Sector X and the 'acropolis', in Sector Z, traces have been found of the archaic and fifth-century circuit walls. Hellenistic floors paved with amphora feet (Fig. 8) are an unusual feature here. From the later Hellenistic period on this area lay outside the circuit and was used as a cemetery. The city area was to shrink yet farther, and the shortest, best preserved circuit is Roman, of the fourth century A.D. and later. North of the site, beyond the present-day Lake Sino6, lies a large cemetery of tumuli. One of the largest (xvi, 'Belvedere')1o was 40 m. across and of the Roman period, but it lay over five other small tumuli of the sixth to fourth centuries B.c. The funeral pyres, collective tombs, the interment of horses and, FIG. 8 apparently, human sacrifices, shows that these are 'Thracian' burials, but the burial goods include many Attic and East Greek vases, purchased by the local notables from the Greek colony. The earliest pottery does not carry the history of Istros appreciably earlier than 6oo B.c." The sixth- century vases are rich in quality and variety, including good Attic of the middle of the century on (Fig. 9), Rhodian Wild Goat vases, unidentified black-figure (Fig. xo), Chian (including the base of an early chalice of seventh-century type) and Fikellura. Notable among the Fikellura vases is one with a satyr and maenad on either side, drawn with some incised detail (Fig. ii), and fragments with centaurs.'2 There are many archaic Chian wine amphorae; very little Corinthian; and there seems to have been local production of a bucchero-type pottery in Ionian shapes. An archaic pithos from Sector X has relief decoration of stamped (or rolled) guilloche on raised bands, of a type met in the Cyclades.I3 Part of the torso of a mid-sixth century kouros (Fig. 12) can be added to the few pieces of archaic sculpture from the Black Sea cities.14 Other sculpture from Istros is largely votive statuettes and reliefs of later date. A small number of good late Hellenistic terracottas (as Fig. 13), and a kiln, found in Sector X, offer evidence for local workshops 10 Dacia iii (1959) 143 ff. 11 A useful survey of the early levels by Condurachi in Griechische Stddte (ed.

Alexandrescu has published fragments (Studii Classice iv (1962) 49 ff.) from earlier excavations which he describes as late or sub-geometric, but they seem not unlike the linear-decorated parts of fourth-century or even later vases. An East Greek vase-painter was called Istrokles in the mid- seventh century. This argues familiarity with the Danube (Istros) by this date (J. M. Cook, BSA 53-54 (1958-59) I6; Greeks in Ionia and the East 53 fig. 12). R. M. Cook, ap. Roebuck, Ionic Trade and Colonisation I 18 n. 113, points out that there was an Istros in East Greece. But the name is Thracian not Greek (according to Detschev, Die thrak. Sprachreste), so this too should derive from some knowledge of the Black Sea; and cf.

Just north of Istros, at Zmeica, there seems to have been a similar emporium of the Hellenistic period. RUSSIA Most of the important Greek sites have been the scene of renewed excavations by Soviet archaeolo- gists, and no little work had to be done to repair the ravages of war at many places. Excavations have been carefully planned, conducted and published. One feature of the publication is the attention paid to earlier work on the sites, and the attempt to cor- relate all the available archaeological evidence. This has involved much publication and some re- publication of important earlier finds. (Repetitive reports, and essays barely rewritten for another publication, are unhappy characteristics of western archaeology also.) Another feature is the time devoted to the domestic architecture and settlements in the Greek cities, not simply their temples, agora and walls. And finally, good reconnaissance and excavation have identified a number of minor sites and yielded some evidence about the relationship of Greeks with the native population. All this constitutes what is perhaps the most important concerted operation of recent years in the archaeology of the Greek world. Excavations on Greek colonial sites are reported in various Russian periodicals. Materiali i issle- dovaniya po archeologii SSSR (Materials and Researches; abbrev. Mat. Res. here), published by the Moscow Academy of Sciences, appears irregularly but often, and sometimes part or all of one volume is devoted to a single site.

They carry scenes of a winged goddess with griffins (Fig. 2o), a centaur, a hero fighting a lion, a mounted Scythian and geese.24 Tyras stands at the mouth of the river of the same name (now Dniestr).25 The ancient city is concealed beneath the remblai formed at the time of the con- struction of the Akerman fortress, and excavations have yielded remains largely of its later history, although something of the layout of the Hellenistic town can be made out. The published finds are no earlier than the fourth century but sixth-century pottery has been reported. The Odessos which stood to the west of the estuary of the Borysthenes (Dniepr) has long been thought to lie near the mouth of the Tiligoul (cf. RE, s.v.) and excavations have now uncovered part of a major site on the left bank of that river. The island (? once a peninsula) Berezan in the Bug/ Dniepr estuary has generally been regarded as the site of the first Greek settlement in this area, before the foundation at Olbia. It has yet to yield anything appreciably earlier than the earliest finds at Olbia and seems to have been abandoned by the Greeks early in the fifth century. Post-war excavations have revealed more of the sixth-century town, including a pit-dwelling of a type met on native sites of this period. The site is the source for much of the earliest Greek pottery from South Russia. Skydnova has studied the Chian and Rhodian vases,26 none of them obviously earlier than the end of the seventh century. There is good Attic black-figure of the first half of the sixth century, and a surprising import is an Eretrian black-figure vase (Fig. 21) of the mid- century.27 Other important recent publications of its early pottery are in Mat. Res. 50 and Fabricius, Arch. Karta i. Olbia. Sir Ellis Minns reviewed the work done at Olbia since the appearance of his Scythians and Greeks (1913) in JHS lxv (1945) 109-12, with a plan of the site and references to publications. Recent work has been devoted to the Upper Town, its Agora and houses, most of which are Hellenistic or of the Christ- ian era, and to the repair of war-damage, since the site had been robbed for defence works and the local museum ransacked. Articles in Mat. Res. 50 discuss various aspects of the site and its history. In the Agora monumental altars of the fifth and third centuries have been uncovered, as well as the founda- tions of a large peripteral temple and a large public building. An early fifth-century dedication (on a late black-figure palmette cup) names Apollo Delphinios (AdAptvto) and a votive deposit of his sanctuary was found in 1955. In the town basement-storerooms of classical date were identified and a start has been made on the detailed study of the architecture of the houses. A regular grid-plan of roads seems to have been established in part of the town, north of the Agora, by about 500. Some of the finer town houses have good ashlar walls, others are of mudbrick. An interesting feature is the damp-course foundations of ashes and clay which recalls the measures for land reclamation or consolidation at Istros (see above). The traces of a fortification wall on the west are now 22 In Gr. Stddte (above, n. i1) 60 ff., pls. 23, 24, 27-29, and Sovy. Arch. 1956 215 ff. 23 Gr.

There are said to be signs of an extensive disaster in the city followed by rebuilding, in the late fourth century. Contracted burials of the sixth-fourth centuries found in the cemeteries of Olbia (and Chersonesos) are identified as of Scythians living in the Greek towns (cf. Hdt. iv 78.5-79.2); grave goods, like vases, are Greek, but weapons are of Scythian sought out, and in Mat. Res. 50 154 ff. a useful conspectus is given of finds there in the Scythian animal style. In Soobsch. Erm. xii (1957) 48 ff. important earlier finds of Attic pottery are published, including some Sophilean fragments. An unusual bone ring, with a female portrait head as device, was found in 1948 and dated to the third century by Maximova (Sov. Arch. 28 (1958) 248-55). The FIG. 21 types. These finds are largely from a cemetery in the north-east quarter of the later town. Architectural and sculpture finds published in Sov. Arch. 29/30 248 ff. include a late archaic volute fragment which is thought to be the acroterion of an altar, the shoulder of an archaic kore and archaic terracottas. Studies of the fourth-century and Hellen- istic terracottas have suggested that most were im- ported from Asia Minor and that the only local school was influenced by Scythian motifs. The native element in Olbia has naturally been particularly development and dating of the cast bronze coins of Olbia have been discussed by Furmanskaj (Kratkie Kiev 1954. 3 6o ff.) in the light of new finds. Since some were found at Berezan, which seems to have been abandoned in the early fifth century, the issue may begin as early as 500. Attention has been paid to sites near Olbia where the population seems to have been at least in part Greek, from as early as the end of the sixth century. One of these, at Sirokaya balka, just south of Olbia, yields evidence for close relations with the Greek</page><page sequence="11">44 J. BOARDMAN colony from its earliest years. These settlements include native pit-houses as well as mudbrick and stone structures of Greek type. Kerkinitis (Eupatoria) was the most noteworthy Greek city in the West Crimea.28 Excavations there have shown that the native site which preceded the Greek foundation was in close touch with the Greek colonies, to judge from the pottery, which goes back to the later sixth century. Some have suggested that Kerkinitis was in fact founded as a Greek colony before its resettlement from Chersonesos in the fourth century. Its fortification wall was built in the Hellenistic period; part of a round tower has been excavated. There have been several excavations of Scythian sites and burials in this area, and much of the Hellenistic art of the Greek cities on this coast is seen to be semi- barbaric. Kalos Limen, named in three Chersonesos inscrip- tions, is located by Russian archaeologists 65 km. north of Kerkinitis. It is a smaller, later site, but a nearby Scythian tumulus has produced, it is said, sixth- century Greek pottery. The town itself was founded around 3oo-one of several settled from Chersonesos. Chersonesos, near Sevastopol, is the subject of studies published in Mat. Res. 34. Excavations continue on the site, which is another of those at which the relationship with the local population-Taurians and Scythians-can be studied in some detail. The colony seems to have taken the place of a Taurian settlement, and a fifth-fourth century cemetery includes 40 (out of 150) contracted burials, which are thought to be of native Taurians living beside the Greeks. The cemetery area was later incorporated within the town. The earliest Greek finds are of the end of the sixth century. These suggest that the site was a Milesian settlement before its new foundation from Herakleia Pontika towards the end of the fifth century. A late classical fortress wall has been dated by finds of red-figure, and a theatre, whose earliest period seems to be of the third century B.C. has been excavated-the first to be found in any of the Black Sea cities. In the Hellenistic town one house was found to cover an area of some 150 sq. m., including apebble- paved court. It had a cellar cut in the rock while one of the larger rooms had a central stone altar and a hearth in the corner. Its storeroom was well stocked with amphorae and fishing gear. Another house was supplied with oval vats which contained traces of colouring matter and may have been a dyeing establishment. The pre-war find of a Hellenistic pebble mosaic showing two women bathing is now published, in Mat. Res. 34 (Fig. 22). It is in a residential area, mainly of two-house insulae (Fig. 23), in the north of the town. Early Hellenistic farm 28 On the problems of the location of Kerkinitis at Eupatoria see A TL i 496 f. Burn, The Lyric Age of Greece I 15, suggests that Herodotus' Kerkinitis was Berezan, but the Greek settlement at Berezan seems not to have survived the early fifth century, while Kerkinitis, from its coins, did. FIG. 22</page><page sequence="12">GREEK ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE SHORES OF THE BLACK SEA 45 houses on the peninsula site have been discovered and the property of one kleros estimated at over 700 acres; its produce-wheat, wine and timber. A whole wine installation which was excavated, with its presses, vats and cellars, is of the early Roman period. There was a local pottery producing wine amphorae in the Hellenistic period. The amphora stamps of the astynomoi have been studied as well as the local tile stamps of the same date. The pottery industry at Chersonesos seems to have been particularly active in the third century B.C. Other studies of finds at Chersonesos draw attention to the jewellery finds in tombs there and the evidence for the cult of Herakles. In the East Crimea and the Taman peninsula work has proceeded apace on the already partly explored colonial sites, as Panticapaeum and Phanagoria, but the identity and early importance of other subsidiary foundations has now been established. Excavations on nearly all the Greek sites have shown that they were CELLAR COURT cour ,N A SM. FIG. 23 founded on pre-existing native settlements. Gener- ally the finds of the first centuries of the Greek towns have been slight, except for pottery, but the prosperity of the Bosporan Kingdom in the Hellenistic period has been well demonstrated by the well-appointed houses and factories which have been uncovered. These, and their successors of the Roman period, offer a vivid picture of the vigorous commercial life fostered by the Greeks in the Black Sea. The vine was cultured to good effect, wineries have been found and whole series of locally-made wine amphorae recog- nised.29 Tanning and dyeing are attested and especially the fisheries which are represented by the pickling vats in which the Kerch herring and tunny were prepared for export to the Aegean. Panticapaeum (Kerch) on the western shore of the Cimmerian Bosporus had been the scene of early excavations, and the Greek and native cemetery sites had been well explored. The same areas have been studied further in recent years and attention has been paid also to the subsidiary foundations at Myrmekion, Tiritaka, etc. In Panticapaeum excavations have been conducted mainly on the north and seaward sides of Mt Mithra- dates, the town acropolis. The site had suffered from wartime trenching, and in works of reconstruction the opportunity was taken to explore more of the town area. The most important reports of the work done 0 /Octf FIG. 24 appear in Mat. Res. 56 and 103. The earliest pottery from the site now published includes East Greek fragments of the earlier part of the sixth century,30 Rhodian and Chian. Much more of the monumental architecture of the town has been uncovered. This includes mouldings from various Ionic buildings, ranging from the late sixth century to Roman in date. An archaic base31 with fluted torus and triple scotia in the spira (Fig. 24) most resembles a type found in Chios,32 and other architectural styles of that island are reflected in a late classical ovolo fragment (Fig. 25) carved with elaborated lotus and palmette.33 In the Hellenistic period the slopes of the town were terraced for larger FIG. 25 houses. To the north-east of Mt Mithradates a pre- Greek, 'Cimmerian' settlement has been identified, and is thought to have served as an emporium for the Greeks before the colony was founded. The nearby cemetery contains elaborate tumulus burials, richly 29 A valuable conspectus of imported and local wine amphorae from the area is to be found in Mat.

BOARDMAN FIG. 26 FIG. 27 furnished, especially in the fourth-third centuries B.C. The stone-built burial chambers seem to copy native constructions, more often of wood, such as are found in the Kuban tumuli. Of the rich finds of pottery published in Mat. Res. 56 and 103 we may pick out the early sixth-century East Greek jug (Fig. 26) with a wine jar drawn upon its shoulder (56 183, fig. 1.1; 103 1o9, fig. 2), and the fragment of an East Greek black-figure vase (56 188 fig. 3.14; our Fig. 27) with a vintage scene, from a FIG. 28 school (or artist) whose work is found also in Etruria and Egypt,34 as well as other fine black-figure (Clazomenian). The plainer pottery which was made in Panticapaeum and Phanagoria from their earliest days has been carefully studied by Kruglikova. The limestone head of a warrior, found in 1946, is attributed to a local workshop; it is apparently fifth- century. Other sculptures from the Bosporan area are also now taken to be from local schools working in a style which is seen to reflect something of the native tradition, but since there was no real native tradition for this type of work it should perhaps rather be 34 On the Ricci hydria and the Oxford Karnak vase (JHS lxxviii (1958) pls.

Especial attention has been paid to the certainly local vogue for anthropomorphic stelae in the Hellenistic period, and to the local production of bone plaques and statuettes. A fine head of a woman (Fig. 28), in island marble, was found in 1949, and part of a large relief showing a griffin (1954) is dated to the fourth century. The terracottas of Panticapaeum and Phanagoria are discussed by Kobylina in a mono- graph of 1961.

It has been the scene of joint Polish-Russian excavations which are described by Michalowski in Myrmeki i, ii, and earlier finds are reviewed in Mat. Res. 25. A fifth-century fortification wall has been traced, covering part of the earlier cemetery. The earliest finds are of the end of the sixth century. Hellenistic wineries and fish-salting stations have been identified. A nearby vineyard estate, with its workshops and installations, has been thoroughly investigated. It is of the second-first centuries B.C. FIG. 30 FIG. 31 Tiritaka, some io km. south of Panticapaeum, appears to have been an important fishing centre in its later Greek and Roman periods. Sixth-century houses are reported and fifth-century and Hellenistic fortifications. The earliest finds, now published, suggest that Tikritaka was founded well before 550. Mat. Res. 25 includes various essays on the site and publishes the pre-war finds. These include some fine East Greek pottery, as well as some most unusual fragments which appear to be orientalising (227 fig. 1.2-8) and a fragment with an inscription. The for- mer (from a dinos) may be related to Aeolic versions of the canonic East Greek Wild Goat style vases, and seem to have something in common with Phyrgian painted wares of the sixth century. Work at Nymphaeum is described in Mat. Res. 69 and there is an important monograph by Chydyak, Is Istorii Nympheya (I962). The most important recent finds have been in the sanctuary areas on the acropolis (Aphrodite and Kabeiroi) and the lower terrace of the town in the southern quarter near the ancient harbour (Demeter). The shrines of Demeter and Aphrodite were founded in the early years of the colony, in the sixth century to judge from the votives. The Aphrodite sanctuary was of unusual plan. Four-roomed in the first phase, then three-roomed with hearth-altars. The distinctive offerings identify the deity as well as an assemblage of cult objects. The finds in the Demeter sanctuary include good East Greek and Attic pottery. For the Kabeiroi a small apsidal temple (5 X 14'3 m.) of fifth-century</page><page sequence="15">48 J. BOARDMAN FIG. 32 date (Fig. 30) succeeded an archaic temple, and near by were large votive deposits of the early sixth to fourth centuries. The architectural terracottas of the Kabeiroi and Demeter temples seem to have been imported from Sinope in the fifth century.35 They are in the form of double rosettes, with blossoms (Fig. 31) or female heads at the centre. All the sanctuaries were destroyed in the fourth century, possibly on the occasion of Leukon's expedition against Theodosia. Later, the city wall ran over the sanctuary area. In the town the stone-built houses of the Greeks overlie the foundation pits of the huts occupied by the natives immediately (it is assumed) before their arrival. Fifth-fourth century houses were cleared on the acropolis (Fig. 32, with a cistern). Skydnova has distinguished a group of archaic vases, found only in the Demeter sanctuary at Nymphaeum,36 which may be of local manufacture (fragments in Fig. 33). The shapes are East Greek, and the linear decoration is derived from that of the simpler East Greek vases, with floral elaboration of the common 'moustaches' motif and a fondness for groups of tear- shaped blobs. The style is close to that of vases from Olynthus, of Robinson's pre-Persian Group III,37 and there may be some connexion between these provincial wares. The earliest pottery from the site now includes mid-sixth-century Attic black-figure.38 Theodosia. A little more has been done in the fifth- century levels of the town, which appears to have been founded on a native site. Sixth-century finds include some Attic black-figure of the second quarter of the century (ABV 81 no. 7) and suggest either settlement 35 On the importance of the short route across from Sinope see Maximova in Klio xxxvii (1959) IOI ff. 36 Kratkie Ukrain.

BOARDMAN by other Greeks (Milesians from Panticapaeum) before the Megarian settlement from Herakleia, or (just as probable) close relations between the natives and the Milesian cities in the straits. Phanagoria was the principal Greek city on the east side of the straits. Excavations there have been summarised in Mat. Res. 19 and 57. Recent work FIG. 38 has been devoted to the Hellenistic cemetery and to parts of the town, from which pottery of the later sixth century has been recovered. The literary date for the foundation (by Teians fleeing before the Persians) is c. 540. Vase fragments published as 'Chalcidian' (which would be unique in this area) seem more probably Ionian in origin (Mat. Res. 19 196 fig. 6.2, 3; 57 164-67; 103 95). Local produc- tion of architectural terracottas brought an end to the import of these fittings from Sinope. Trade with the native population is attested by the rich finds of wine amphorae, the earliest being Chian and Thasian of the fifth century, which have been made in a number of the native fortified towns some distance off inland, to the south east. Other finds include (from near Phanagoria) a magnificent marble acroterion (Fig. 34), dated to the fourth century, part of an archaic grave relief (Fig. 35), Hellenistic terracottas of the highest quality (the head of a young satyr, Fig. 36) and the fragment of a vase stamped with the device of a satyr's head (Fig. 37), which recalls the coins of Pantica- paeum, and the initials of the city's name, (DA. Early Hellenistic houses have been discovered at Patraea, a small site on the north side of the bay facing Phanagoria, and there is now sixth-century pottery from Kepoi, at the eastern recess of the bay. At Hermonassa, modern Taman, the first serious excava- tions have reached the sixth-century level at a depth of over 9 m. and mudbrick houses of the late sixth century have been identified. In Gorgippia, modern Anapa, a reconnaissance established the area of the city and position of its cemetery. There are superficial indications that it could have been an early settlement, of the end of the sixth century. Nearby Sindian towns, which were absorbed in the Bosporan Kingdom, have also been explored. Many of the villages in the Taman peninsula have been investigated. Some are fortified. There is imported Greek pottery in several of them, and their way of life seems to have been considerably condi- tioned by the proximity of the Greek colonies although their simple architecture and elaborate burial customs remained unaffected. Tanais. Knipovich has given a full account of the site on the Don and its history in Tanais (Moscow, 1944). An earlier settlement, near Elisavetovskaya, may have been called Tanais, before the foundation of the better known town near Nedvigovski. In the Taganrog Straits underwater exploration has yielded late seventh-century Greek pottery, perhaps from a pre-colonial trading post (cf. the early finds up the Don, above).38sa Colchis. The eastern coast of the Black Sea has hitherto been somewhat neglected, but the topography of the Greek settlements is now better understood and the early importance of the Greek settlement at Phasis appreciated. Early coins of Colchis, with a woman's head (obv.) and bull's head (rev.) have generally been put c.4oo despite their obvious archaic appearance. The discovery of examples with later sixth-century pottery at Nymphaeum, and the pub- lication of coins with other late archaic devices reinforces the argument from style,39 but it is clear 38sa Archaeology xvi. 93 f. 39 Vestnik 1952 238-42; Kapanadze, Grusinskaya numismatika; Lang, Num.

TURKEY Of the Greek sites on the south shores of the Black Sea comparatively little is known. Trapezous re- mains to be found beneath Trebizond. Excavations at Sinope have met with some success both in the peninsula town and in the cemetery on the mainland. The evidence bearing on the date of the foundation still hardly brings it earlier than 6oo.41 Pre-war finds in the area are now published. One is a superb bronze hydria, with a woman's bust at the upper handle junction, inscribed nap hEpas ApyEtaa Eyt ov haFEO6Aov, a twin of the Argive prize hydria in New York.42 Two grave stelae with two and three (Fig. 38) figures are early classical in date-early examples of the naiskos-stelae.43 In the town the foundations of a Hellenistic temple and altar were found, together with architectural revetments and mouldings from archaic to Roman in date, and votives-terracottas and vases, including some Phrygian.
