The author apparently has little familiarity with evolutionary theory, and his ignorance makes him antagonistic. We find such statements as "to make up to the twenty-five recognised species of Atlantic gull (sic), the original ancestral stock did not exceed more than about four recognisable super species." If Stokes really does understand what a superspecies is, he fails to enlighten the reader. And does he understand what a species is? "The ways of scientists are indeed difficult for the mere layman to understand." Birds sometimes look the same and are called different species "yet no one doubts that (the north European man and the pigmy) are merely race variations of the species H. sapiens." If you like anthropomorphic descriptions of birds, attend to the Herring Gull which "is one of the most evil scoundels of all birds . . . Nothing is too despicable for the Herring Gull." And some of the writing is simply poor: "The name [of the Adelie Penguin] is derived from Madam Adelie Durville, after whom the bird was originally named." It is unfortunate that the illustrator, Shackleton, did not write the text, for his preface is the most literate of its kind I have read: "A fickle task-master, the ocean has guided a trend of evolution for those who live off her bounty, with scope enough to make the flightless penguin equally as successful an animal as the long-winged albatross." And the masterful Shackleton sums up for us his subjects: "They bewitch us and humiliate us with their unassuming mastery of wind, water and whereabouts. They provide inspiration and example for mariners and aeronauts alike, but that is not all. Since man first ventured into their domain they have offered the solace of live company and visual delight where their need is greatest." Buy this book, read Shackleton's preface, marvel at his illustrations, but forget the text.-Jack P. Hailman. 86. Wildfowl 19. G. V. T. Mathews and M. A. Ogilvie. 1968. Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, England. 172 pp. $2.50 paperback-Wild- fowl 19 is the continuation of the old Wildfowl Trust Annual Reports, which went 18 volumes. The new issue contains 18 papers (some of which are noted elsewhere: see reviews 8, 16, 36, 38, 45, 46), an editorial, some miscellaneous reports, and the annual report of the Trust. It is an attractive volume (the cover painting and drawings by Peter Scott help greatly), and yet a scientific one too. It contains magnificent photographs. Some of the contributions lack summaries, an omission that is tantamount to criminal in the modern age of information explosion. And lest Americans get confused, "wildfowl" means only ducks, geese and swans, not all wild fowl. The new publishing concept is a good one, and we shall await Wildfowl 20 with anticipation.-Jack P. Hailman. NOTES AND NEWS The Bowdoin Scientific Station (Kent Island, Grand Manan, New Brunswick, Canada) offers facilities for research, on colonial sea-birds in particular. Visitors not planning research are welcome, if space permits. Inquiries may be addressed to the Director, Prof. Charles E. Huntington, Dept. of Biology, Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Me. 0401 1. NEBBA dates to bear in mind: a spring field meeting on June 21 and 22, 1969, in Litchfield County, Conn. (centered at the White Memorial Foundation); the annual meeting on November 8th, again at Drumlin Farm in Lincoln, Mass. NEBBA now has 18 types of mist nets in stock, including tethered types, corresponding to all standard types except type B. The quantities in stock vary greatly. While NEBBA makes immediate shipment on over 99% of all orders, we regret that we cannot guarantee immediate shipment across the board. In- quiries or orders should be directed to: Mr. E. A. Bergstrom, 37 Old Brook Road, West Hartford, Coinn. 06117. The Manomet Bird Observatory has started a membership drive. The Observatory has been offered 18 acres of land (with a quartermile of shorefront) with a house for headquarters, 44 miles south of Boston, in a natural concentration spot for migrants. The Observatory will serve as an educational center for en-</page><page sequence="2">Vol. 40, No. 2 Notes and News [ ]79 vironmental biology, interest young people in concepts of conservation, help teachers to gain added experience in field work, hold classes in banding techniques, and undertake studies of bird migration, breeding and behavior. It is already one of the major stations in Operation Recovery. Acceptance of the land and buildings, and operation of the Observatory, require adequate financial backing as well as the enthusiasm of volunteer workers. Both large and small gifts are needed. A broad membership base will not only produce an important part of the Observatory's current income but also strengthen the case for support by foundations and other large givers. Annual dues start at $7. Membership information may be obtained from Miss Barbara Treat, Mem- bership Secretary, Manomet Bird Observatory, 720 Jerusalem Road, Cohasset, Mass. 02025. Questions about use of the Observatory should be sent to its director, Mrs. Paul T. Anderson, Wolf Trap Hill, R. F. D. No. 2, Winter St., Middle- borough, Mass. 02346. The NEBBA Council has endorsed the objectives of the Observatory, and made a research grant of $200 to it. The Subcommittee on Collections, of the Committee on Research of the American Ornithologists' Union, is conducting a survey of collections of birds in the United States and Canada. In the past, many studies utilizing museum materials have been handicapped by ignorance of the existence of potentially important specimens. We hope, by means of this survey, to enable future workers to take full advantage of all available material. Survey forms have been sent to institutions and individuals known to have, or suspected of having, an orni- thological collection. We request your assistance so that our survey will be as complete as possible. If you have received a survey form, please complete it and return it promptly. If you have a collection and have not received a form, or if you know of other persons or institutions who have collections but who have not received a form, please notify Richard C. Banks, Bird and Mammal Laboratories, U. S. National Museum, Washington, D. C. 20560. NO MIST NETS IN JULY As I expect to be out of town, we regret that NEBBA will be unable to ship nets (or furnish information or quotations on nets) from about July 6th through July 30, 1969. As this issue goes to press, orders for nets are running heavier than in any year past, but we have substantial stocks on hand and on order. We will make every effort to fill all orders received before July 6th, but ordering earlv will be helpful. E. A. Bergstrom REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION The behavior and migrations of the Whistling Swan (Olor columbianus) in the U. S. and Canada are being studied as a step toward solving the serious prob- lem of collisions between these birds and aircraft. The birds are being marked at several locations by several methods-color dyes, plastic neck collars, and color leg bands (the leg bands carry numbers large enough to be read with binoculars, at times when the leg is visible during feeding or swimming). The work is being carried on with the cooperation of a variety of governmental and private agencies, but the help of field observers is badly needed. Reports of marked birds should be sent to (and further details may be obtained from): Dr. William J. L. Sladen, Johns Hopkins Univ., 615 N. Wolfe St., Baltimore, Md. 21205. People who maintain a series of ten or more nesting boxes for Eastern Blue- birds (Sialia sialis) have been sending nesting information to Dr. Douglas James, Dept. of Zoology, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, Ark. 72701. The data are used to evaluate the annual population fluctuations of the species. Persons who qualify but are not now participating in the program are requested to write Dr. James for the project report form. In 1967 and 1968, Common (Sterna hirundo) and Roseate (S. dougallii) Terns were banded by the Linnean Society of New York on Great Gull Island, seven miles ENE of Orient Point (N. Y.) at the mouth of Long Island Sound. Each carried three colored plastic bands: in 1969 at least some of the birds banded will</page></plain_text>
