GUNNERSON ABSTRACT The Fremont culture of northeastern Utah is predom- inately Anasazi in character, but has a few distinctive traits. It exhibits great variability, especially in ceramics and architecture. The total time span of this complex may be the 250-year period from A.D. 950 to 1200. The Fremont culture, and probably the very similar Sevier culture of western Utah, represent a rather sudden north- ward movement of traits, and perhaps people, from the independently-developed, but Kayenta-influenced Virgin branch of the Anasazi. THE CULTURAL POSITION of Pueblo and Pueblo-like complexes in Utah north of the Colorado River has long been uncertain. While this problem cannot yet be completely solved, data obtained from a recent extensive survey of the Fremont area and from work in the Glen Canyon, added to information al- ready available, make possible new interpreta- tions of the archaeology of the region which may provide a fruitful point of departure for further work. This paper is a discussion of the internal dimensions of the Fremont culture, and of the probable relationship of Fremont to Anasazi. It suggests specifically that most if not all of the Pueblo traits in Fremont originated in the as yet poorly defined subdivision of Anasazi for which Colton (1942: 36, 1955: 5) has sug- gested the name "Virgin Branch." The Fremont complex has been recognized as distinct from Anasazi culture since 1931 when Morss reported his work along the Fre- mont River in southern Utah. Subsequently, the Fremont culture has received an increasing amount of attention. Gillin (1938) carried out excavations in Nine Mile Canyon. Work at Fremont sites in the Yampa Canyon in the extreme northwest part of Colorado has been reported by Burgh and Scoggin (1948) and Lister (1951). Wormington (1955) has re- ported several years' work at a site near Cisco, Utah, and summarized the Fremont culture as of that time. Between 1954 and 1957 the Uni- versity of Utah carried out a survey of the Fre- mont area with limited testing (Gunnerson 1957) and excavated two sites (Taylor 1957). Subsequent reconnaissance (Lister 1958) and excavation (Gunnerson 1959) south of the Fre- mont area contributed data which suggested the Fremont-Virgin branch relationship out- lined here. INTERNAL DIMENSIONS The Fremont culture is still not really well known, but there is already ample evidence of great variation in Fremont ceramics, architec- ture, and stone work (Gunnerson 1956, 1957). Fremont may be said to be characterized by ex- perimentation and a variability especially inter- esting in that it is nearly as great within many sites as between sites. There are, however, gen- eralized patterns and specific traits which oc- cur consistently from site to site. Still other traits seem to vary in frequency across the area, especially from north to south. Considering first those traits which appear consistently throughout the entire area, we find the following. Villages are never large. A typi- cal site would have from about six to 12 houses or rooms, although many sites appear to have had only one or two houses. In the case of a few large sites it is difficult to decide whether there were several small villages close together, or one larger village of scattered houses. The favored location for sites is on low knolls or ridges adjacent to lower level land suitable for horticulture. Many of the sites are along small, often intermittent streams, or where the streams emerge from mountain canyons into near-desert land that was probably irrigable by simple diversion of flood water. Throughout the entire Fremont area use was made of caves and rock shelters; some open camp sites in wooded, sandy areas may have been occupied by the Fremont people, although diagnostic artifacts are seldom found in such places. Also, there is considerable homogeneity among the pictographs and petroglyphs of the region and certain distinctive elaborate anthropomorphic designs are generally attributed to the Fremont people, although most of the design elements found are not restricted to this area. Subsist- ence economy was based upon corn, bean and squash agriculture. Bones of game animals are found but are not usually numerous. The Fremont traits with which we are best acquainted are the pottery traits because much of our information is from surface survey. Fre- 373</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY mont pottery may be divided into two main types on the basis of tempering and these types can be correlated with geographical areas. The northern part of the Fremont area, that from the foothills of the Uintah Mountains south to the Book Cliffs, is characterized by plain gray pottery tempered with crushed calcite. That part of the Fremont area south and west of the Book Cliffs is characterized by plain gray pot- tery tempered with crushed igneous rock. A few sites near the Book Cliffs have yielded both types. Wormington (1955: 165) feels that because calcite is a poor tempering material and diffi- cult to obtain, its use was culturally condi- tioned. It seems at least equally probable that the type of tempering material used by Fre- mont people reflected the type of material available. In the area of calcite tempering there is practically no igneous rock, but where igne- ous rock was used, calcite is also available. This suggests that calcite was used as a substi- tute where igneous rock was not available and that the basic trait was the crushing of rock for tempering. In addition to the basic difference in temper- ing, there are numerous variations in decora- tion. The calcite-tempered pottery is seldom decorated and is apparently never painted. The majority of sherds tempered with igneous rock also have a smooth, plain outer surface, but many are decorated by painting and tooling, and a few are corrugated. Both mineral and organic black paint were used on both slipped and unslipped surfaces. Designs are almost al- ways geometric, composed of straight and curved lines of various widths, and dots. For the most part, painting is moderately well exe- cuted and designs most closely resemble Black Mesa, Sosi, and Dogoszhi styles and combina- tions of these styles, which are commonly found in the Kayenta and Virgin branches of the Anasazi. The greater number of pottery sites in the southern part of the Fremont area, and the greater elaboration of pottery there, may reflect the proximity of the southern Fremont people to the Anasazi. Perhaps, however, the technical inferiority of the calcite-tempered ware discour- aged its makers from producing it in quantity, and from decorating it. A major decorative device characteristic of Fremont pottery was the manipulation of the smoothed surface before firing. Such decora- tion included incised lines, lines apparently formed of finger-nail jabs, and areas filled with lines of punctation made with finger nails or other tools, such as sticks. Incised lines often take the form of scoring, with one set of lines vertical on the neck of vessels and the other horizontal. Surface manipulation is almost al- ways restricted to the necks and shoulders of vessels but sometimes occurs on the handles, which usually extend from lip to shoulder. Nodes and appliqued punched pellets (coffee- bean applique) are other decorative devices used. Rarely, incised decorations are found on the vessel lip. Although corrugation was ac- cepted by the Fremont people only to a very limited extent, and corrugated sherds are not common at Fremont sites, those that occur rep- resent a wide variety. Plain corrugated sherds exhibit corrugations ranging from narrow to broad. Indented corrugated sherds are also found, but the elaborate decorative designs formed by combining plain and indented cor- rugation or corrugation and incising, or panels of pinching on otherwise plain corrugated ves- sels have not yet been noted. A very few sherds show painting on the inside and corrugation on the outside and a few sherds referred to as "false corrugated" appear to have been incised or tooled to resemble corrugated ware. Exca- vated Fremont pottery sometimes shows a thin fugitive red layer on the outside. In addition to pottery vessels, Fremont peo- ple also made pottery elbow pipes and elabo- rate unfired clay figurines. Sherds were re- worked to form discs varying in size from about 1.5 to 4.0 cm., and some were perforated, pre- sumably for ornaments and spindle whorls. Un- perforated discs were probably gaming pieces. Other worked sherds are of various sizes and shapes and many were probably used to scrape pottery. The variety of decorations found on the technically superior igneous rock-tempered ware suggests importation of pottery styles, some of which were elaborated by the Fremont people. Actual trade sherds, however, are rare at most Fremont sites, those that occur being from southwest Utah or northern Arizona. Nonceramic artifacts are less useful in estab- lishing relationships between Fremont sites and between Fremont and other complexes. Projec- tile points and blades show wide variation and are not common from surface collections since many of the sites have been picked over by col- 374 [ VOL. 25, No. 3, 1960</page><page sequence="3">THE FREMONT CULTURE lectors. Metates, which vary from deep basins to nearly flat milling stones, are somewhat more helpful. One type, characteristic of cen- tral Utah, is the so-called "Utah metate," which has a large, deep trough at one end and a smaller depression or shelf at the other. Manos from the foothills of the Uintah Moun- tains often show a characteristic rocker shape. Both one-hand, slightly oval manos and loaf- shaped, two-hand manos are found over the whole area. Small ground stone artifacts include tur- quoise pendants and discs of other soft stone which are sometimes perforated. Ornaments were also made of bone, elk teeth, and bone carved to resemble elk teeth. Rectangular bone gaming pieces with various forms of markings are frequently found. Several forms of awls, generally well finished, are the most common bone tool. Some have all or part of the articu- lar end remaining. Others are nearly cylindri- cal, and still others were made from bone splinters. The "Fremont moccasin" with dew claw hobnails, which seems to be exclusively a Fremont trait, is found in the Yampa-Uintah sites as well as in the Fremont River drainage. Architecture shows variations which do not appear to be correlated with chronology. In the Fremont area there are several types of structures which have little or no cultural ma- terial associated with them. The most spectac- ular are the so-called forts or towers, consisting of one or a few rooms of masonry, probably dry-laid, located on high pinnacles, ridges, or canyon edges. Many of these are several hun- dred feet above the valley floors. It seems un- likely that they were residences, but some may have been. More plausible explanations are that they were storage rooms or were ceremo- nial in function. Their identification as Fre- mont is based primarily upon their location in areas where the other archaeological remains are usually Fremont. Structures commonly attributed to the Fre- mont people are small storage rooms built in rock shelters or under overhangs, often where they are well concealed and difficult to get to. Construction is of stone and mud, or of adobe "turtle backs." Design seems to be dictated more by the nature of the rock shelter than by other considerations. Often all or a portion of a niche or rock shelter is walled off to form a cist. Some rock shelters have dwelling rooms, or have served as habitations. The structures in the open villages vary greatly. There were surface houses and pit houses, both square and round. Walls were of adobe, adobe and stone haphazardly combined, stone slab masonry, boulder and adobe ma- sonry, and jacal, or at least poles and adobe. Masonry or perishable walls were apparently built on boulder foundations in some instances. Most structures were single rooms, but some multi-room structures are known. Walls of pit houses were either unplastered, plastered with adobe, or lined with boulders. Benches are not found. Floors were often plastered with adobe. Post holes were sometimes in a regular pattern of four, sometimes randomly scattered and sometimes missing. Usually in dwellings there was a central adobe-rimmed fireplace, often paved with stone slabs. Both living and storage rooms are found at villages; sometimes surface granaries are associated with pit houses. Out- side firepits sometimes occur. Only additional excavation will furnish the data necessary to determine whether there has been any sequence of development of Fremont house types. It appears at present that, as in the case of ceramics, many types of houses were in use at the same time. The skeletal material from Fremont sites is still inadequate for a definitive study. A few traits are of interest, however. Most of the skulls assignable to Fremont sites show marked lambdoidal flattening and would not be out of place in a Pueblo series. In the small sample, dental pathologies and exostoses, on vertebrae especially, are quite common (Gunnerson 1957: 31-4). Very few tree-ring dates are available for Fremont sites and many of those are question- able. Schulman (1948) and Smiley (1951) re- cord several dates from sites, probably Fre- mont, in Nine Mile Canyon, which is located about midway north and south in the Fremont area. The outer rings of the samples dated with confidence range from A.D. 915 to 1145. Most of these samples had many outer rings missing. The only specimen with bark present was the one with the 1145 date; even this had crowded outer rings and was thought by Schul- man to have some rings absent. Smiley (1951) considers the dating of only one Nine Mile Canyon site, NM-13, "good." For this site he reports three dates between A.D. 1055 and 1061 and six dates between A.D. 1078 and 1090, but all specimens have rings missing. GUNNERSON ] 375</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Two sites in Hill Creek Canyon, just across the Green River to the east of Nine Mile Can- yon, have also been dated. Four samples of charcoal from one site, all with many rings missing, gave dates from A.D. 957 to 1073 (Schulman 1948). Smiley (1951) includes a date of A.D. 1000 for a second site in Hill Creek Canyon and evaluates the site dating as poor. The earliest date suggested comes from the Yampa valley in northwest Colorado, where an estimated cutting date for a house timber is provisionally given by Schulman (1950) at A.D. 750?50 years. Cross dating of Fremont sites by means of trade pottery has extended the time range to- ward the more recent. A few sherds of Tusa- yan Polychrome have been found at Fremont sites in the Castle valley area. This type has been dated by Colton and Hargrave (1937) at A.D. 1150-1300. Tusayan Black-on-red sherds have also been found and are datable at A.D. 850 to 1125. Taylor (1957: 49, 96) identifies sherds from both 42Sv7 and 42Sv21 as Tusayan Black-on- white. If this identification is correct, these sherds would suggest that the sites were occu- pied until sometime between A.D. 1225 and 1300, the period during which this type was made (Colton 1955). A re-examination of the pottery from these two sites, however, failed to confirm the Tusayan Black-on-white identifica- tion for any sherds. Most of the sherds so identified by Taylor are probably of local man- ufacture. The locally made black-on-white and black- on-gray pottery shows designs of Black Mesa, Sosi, and Dogozshi styles. The black-on-white types which give these decoration styles their names are found primarily in northern Arizona and are dated respectively at approximately A.D. 900-1100, 1070-1150, and 1070-1150 (Colton 1955). There is a possibility that these styles persisted longer in the Fremont area than far- ther south, but it is highly improbable that they occurred earlier in the Fremont area. On the basis of present evidence, then, it seems advisable to date Fremont culture at about A.D. 950 to 1200, for the best tree-ring dates fall for the most part in that period, and dates before about A.D. 1000 are questionable. Moreover, the trade pottery supports an A.D. 950-1200 range for Fremont sites in the middle and southern parts of the area. Not only was Fremont contemporaneous with the Developmental Pueblo period in the Anasazi area, but most of the sites for which dates are available appear to fall in late Devel- opmental Pueblo times. Even the earliest tree- ring date, which since it is estimated and pro- visional may well be too early, is still post-Bas- ketmaker. ANASAZI RELATIONSHIPS Steward (1940: 468) felt that the essential core of the culture of the "Northern Periph- ery," including the Fremont culture, was de- rived from the Anasazi. More recently, how- ever, it has been suggested that the Fremont culture developed in northeastern Utah out of the hunting and gathering Desert culture (Jen- nings 1956: 102-4; Taylor 1957: 146-8). At no site has this development been clearly dem- onstrated. Perhaps the site that has the best sequence is Hells Midden, located on the Yampa River in the extreme northeastern corner of the Fremont area, where the culture is most attenuated. Here Lister (1951) exca- vated a 5-meter thick midden deposit. In the second level from the top and in the upper part of the third level from the top (there were 15 levels altogether) he found calcite-tempered pottery (Fremont) associated with evidence of maize and an artifact inventory which differed significantly from that found below. During the occupation of the third level from the top there was apparently an abrupt shift to a horti- cultural way of life with the introduction of the Fremont culture. Hunt (1953) has identified many sites in the LaSal Mountain area as non-pottery Fremont, early Fremont, and Fremont (?). Her evidence for most of these identifications is tenuous. Similarly, Rudy (1954) at one time classified several sites in Beef Basin, northeastern San Juan County, as Fremont, but a re-examination of the field notes and specimens disclosed that these sites were characterized primarily by an absence of pottery or other diagnostic artifacts. It would seem best to assign all of these non- ceramic sites to the Desert culture as defined by Jennings and Norbeck (1955: 2-4). During the archaeological survey of the Fremont area (Gunnerson 1957), a number of nonceramic sites, probably Desert culture, were found which could be ancestral Fremont, but there is no strong evidence to support such an assign- ment. 376 [ VOL. 25, No. 3, 1960</page><page sequence="5">THE FREMONT CULTURE Until much more evidence is available, the term Fremont should be restricted to sites com- parable in content to those in the Fremont drainage described by Morss (1931). This would exclude non-ceramic sites. At any rate, the discovery, during the 1954-56 survey, of numerous Fremont sites with substantial dwell- ings and relatively large quantities of painted pottery with Anasazi-influenced designs has turned attention again to the Anasazi region as the probable source for much of Fremont cul- ture, and has helped to make the relationship between the Fremont culture and the Anasazi development in general somewhat clearer. Thus far, we can distinguish a Fremont cul- ture as it existed for perhaps two and a half centuries, prior to about A.D. 1200. For most Fremont traits one can find specific counter- parts in the Anasazi culture at the same or earlier times, and few traits which made their appearance in Anasazi culture before or during Pueblo II are lacking in the Fremont culture. Differences for the most part are ones of quan- tity or relative importance. The most spectacu- lar trait found at some Developmental Pueblo sites, but missing at Fremont sites, is the large multi-room pueblos. Nowhere in the Fremont area is there to be found evidence of large concentrations of population at single sites. Thus far there have been no kivas reported from controlled excavations, but the descrip- tion of one structure excavated by an amateur on his own property near Ferron, Utah, is sug- gestive of a kiva. The small amount of excava- tion completed may account for the lack of evidence of kivas. Turkeys, also, are thus far unreported. Stone axes are apparently missing in the Fremont complex, but these are also scarce in Developmental Pueblo complexes. Corrugated pottery was known to the Fremont people as a trade item (Tusayan Corrugated) and they made a very little locally, but they apparently chose to make more than 99% of their utility ware plain, or plain with tooled decorations. Direct comparison with Anasazi of the Four Corners area has made the Fremont culture seem an anomaly of late Developmental Pu- eblo times; for in Fremont, Basketmaker traits such as plain utility ware, pit houses, and clay figurines, nearly extinct in the Four Corners area in Pueblo times, occurred together with Pueblo traits. Hence Steward felt that a cult- ure ancestral to the complexes of the "North- ern Periphery," and showing the same blend of Basketmaker and Pueblo traits must exist somewhere between the San Juan area and the Northern Periphery. He searched specifically for an archaeological complex having the requisite traits, only to conclude that the region east of Kanab was not related to the "Northern Pe- riphery," and that the source of "Northern Periphery" culture should be sought in western Colorado or extreme eastern Utah, then an archaeologically unknown area (Steward 1941: 281-2, 355). A review of the results of Steward's work east of Kanab plus additional information from the northern drainages of Glen Canyon (Lister 1958, Gunnerson 1959) has revealed that sites as far east as those in the Escalante drainage can be at least tentatively assigned to the Vir- gin branch of the Anasazi. Furthermore, this work along with information now available from the Zion Park area west of Kanab (Sch- roeder 1955) strongly suggests that the Virgin branch contains at a relatively late time a com- plex of early and late traits from which the Pueblo traits in Fremont could have been de- rived. The Virgin branch, in brief, is thought to include the pueblo sites in the northern drain- ages of the Colorado River from the Escalante River drainage on the east to, and including, the Muddy River on the west. This branch appears to have developed independently, but with strong Kayenta influence, from a Basket- maker level through a Classic Pueblo level. However, a few traits which characterize the better known branches of Anasazi, especially in the Pueblo I stage, are lacking in the Virgin branch, although some of the differences may only reflect the uneveness of the data. The archaeology of the eastern part of the Virgin area, for which the name Zion subarea has been suggested, and which is contiguous to the Fremont area, is best known from the work of Schroeder (1955) in Zion Park, Steward (1941) in the Paria-Johnson Canyon area, and Rudy and Stirland (1950) in Washington County. Colton (1952) describes several pottery types found in this area. It is postulated that the Fremont culture of eastern Utah, and probably the very similar Sevier culture (called "Sevier-Fremont," by Jennings 1956: 104; Taylor 1957: 162) of west- ern Utah, represents a northward expansion of Anasazi culture from the Virgin branch after GUNNERSON ] 377</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY about A.D. 950 and before A.D. 1200, the approx- imate terminal date of Fremont. It seems prob- able that the distinctive flavor of the Fremont culture, however, resulted from a blending of Virgin traits with the Desert culture traits of a sparse indigenous population. A number of traits which distinguish the Vir- gin branch from other Anasazi complexes could have been the source for similar Fremont (and Sevier) traits. One of the most characteristic traits of the Fremont culture is the predomin- ance of plain utility ware as opposed to the cor- rugated wares which were then in vogue in much of the rest of the Anasazi area. In the Virgin area, plain pottery was introduced in an essentially Basketmaker III context, and per- sisted into Pueblo III times. The Four Corners Pueblo I pottery, with the start of corrugation in the form of neck banding, appears never to have occurred in the Virgin area in any signifi- cant amount. Virgin pottery shows a gradual transition into a complex comparable to that of the Pueblo II farther east, except that plain utility were continued to predominate over cor- rugated wares until Pueblo III times. Not only does Fremont pottery appear to have developed from a Virgin base, but it seems to have its genesis in the later Pueblo II Virgin pottery. Schroeder (1955:103) states that plain ware associated with the Basket- maker III through early Pueblo II painted types "usually contains fairly large subangular quartz temper in relatively clean paste" and that the plain ware associated with late Pueblo II and early Pueblo III types "usually contains small quartz, with occasional large particles and vary- ing proportions of fragments which sometimes dominate," and that associated decorated pot- tery and associated trade sherds never show the large rounded quartz particles found in the earlier pottery from the Virgin area. Of the various regions of the Virgin branch, the Escalante drainage seems to show the larg- est proportion of angular fragments with the sand tempering. If this tendency is carried further one gets the crushed igneous roqcktem- pering of Fremont pottery (Gunnerson 1956) or the abundance of moderately fine to fine, angular sand tempering derived from igneous rock, with very sparse quartz sand, found in Snake Valley and Sevier Gray pottery of west- ern Utah (Rudy 1953: 83-91). Steward (1941: 302) noted similarities between the plain gray pottery of the Paria and Johnson Canyon re- gion and Sevier Gray. The common occurrence of dots in lines or filling areas on Fremont painted wares has been somewhat puzzling, since dots are most commonly found on Lino Black-on-gray pottery dated earlier than A.D. 750. But Virgin pottery also made use of dots in designs, and this may have been the source of the Fremont trait. Relationship between the Fremont culture and the area to the south is further supported by the presence at Fremont sites of Kayenta, or Kayenta affinis (Virgin) trade pottery and the absence of trade sherds from the Four Corners area. A re-examination of pottery from the Old Woman and Poplar Knob has failed to disclose any Mancos Black-on-white sherds as reported by Taylor (1957: 49, 96). The sherds so identified are of local manufacture and can be assigned to the type Turner Gray-Variety Two (Wormington 1955: 71-3; Gunnerson 1956). Several other distinctive traits found in both Fremont and the Virgin branch suggest a rela- tionship between the two complexes. Both had a variety of styles of manos and metates, in- cluding the distinctive Utah metate. Skin moc- casins, while not of the usual Fremont type, have been found along with sandals at one Vir- gin site. Stone balls are not as common in Virgin sites as in Fremont, but they do occur. Clay figurines, a hallmark of Fremont culture, occur in Virgin sites. The sharing of several architectural traits also suggests a relationship between the two complexes. Both utilized simultaneously a vari- ety of types of construction: sometimes, for ex- ample, within single structures one wall may be of masonry and the other three of perishable materials. Small storage bins or granaries are commonly found in small rock shelters in both areas. Several architectural traits found else- where in Anasazi are lacking in both Virgin and Fremont. Neither group has large, multi- room pueblos. Neither group carefully shaped and dressed stone slabs for building. Double walls with rubble cores were not constructed. Common pit-house features missing in both are multiple rooms, vestibules, and partitions. The Fremont settlement pattern was very similar to that of the Virgin branch. Sites were small; those containing a dozen or more rooms were rare. In especially desirable areas, sites were sometimes situated within less than a tenth of a mile of one another. Combinations 378 [ VOL. 25, No. 3, 1960</page><page sequence="7">THE FREMONT CULTURE of different types of structures at a site, such as surface granaries associated with pit houses, are found in both complexes. Open sites are usu- ally found on ridges or knolls near tillable land and sources of water. Two generalizations can be drawn which sug- gest that the basic orientations of the two cul- tures were similar. Both appear to be charac- terized by a great deal of variability, with many alternative traits. This in turn may be the re- sult of a tendency, most obvious in the Virgin branch because of its greater time depth, for old traits to be retained rather than discarded when new traits were added to the complex. SUMMARY It is suggested as a hypothesis that the Fre- mont culture (and probably the very similar Sevier culture) represents a northern extension of many Pueblo traits and perhaps people into northeastern (and northwestern) Utah on a Pueblo II-early Pueblo III time level, and that these traits stemmed from the poorly known Virgin branch of the Anasazi which ap- pears to have developed independently, but with very heavy Kayenta influence in the northern drainages of the Colorado River from that of the Escalante River on the east to and including that of the Muddy River on the west.
