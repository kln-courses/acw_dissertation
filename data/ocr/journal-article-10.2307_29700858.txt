Abstract Previous studies have suggested that increased body mass is associated with an increased risk of prostatic cancer, but these studies have been limited by the fact that they were based on a few simple measure? ments such as height and weight. Similar results were found in a prospective study of the incidence of prostatic cancer in a cohort of Japanese men born in 1900-19 and living in Hawaii. Further evaluation of the extensive anthropomorphic measurements made in this cohort suggested that the association between measures of body mass and prostatic cancer might be accounted for more by lean tissue than by fat tissue. There was a significant positive association of the risk of prostatic cancer with area of muscle in the arm but not with area of fat in the arm. Further research is needed on the biological mechanisms of carcinogenesis that may be related to both lean and fat tissue and the development of prostatic cancer. Introduction Although several studies have attempted to identify factors that cause prostatic cancer, little has been established. Recently it was reported that the risk of prostatic cancer increased with increasing body mass index.1 This finding, which was derived from a hospital based case-control study of the incidence of prostatic cancer in northern Italy, is consistent with mortality data from prospective studies of Seventh Day Adventists2 and volunteers from the American Cancer Society3 in the United States, which both found an increased risk of prostatic cancer in overweight men. Xhese studies were restricted in that they related risk solely to variables based on height and weight. We report a prospective study of the incidence of prostatic cancer in a cohort of Japanese men living in Hawaii in which we recorded extensive anthropomorphic measurements. Patients and methods A cohort of 8006 Japanese men who had been born during 1900-19 and were living in the Hawaiian island of Oahu in 1965 were examined and interviewed from 1965 to 1968.4 Several anthropomorphic measure? ments were recorded during the clinical examination. Body mass index was calculated as weight (kg)/(height) in))2, and the areas of muscle and fat in the upper arm were calculated according to the equations of Heymsfield et al and Frisancho, respectively.56 Seven men with prostatic cancer at the time of examination were eliminated from the analysis. The time at risk of prostatic cancer was calculated for each subject as the time from examination to a BMJ volume 297 17 September 1988 713</page><page sequence="2">histologically confirmed diagnosis of prostatic cancer, death, or September 1986, whichever occurred first. These calculations resulted in a total of 139 727 person years at risk. The relative risk of prostatic cancer was estimated from proportional hazards regression models, while adjusting for age at examination.7 Results During the surveillance period 174 cases of prostatic cancer were recorded in the cohort. Table I shows the risk of prostatic cancer associated with various anthro? pomorphic measurements. Body mass index showed a positive association with risk of prostatic cancer, but the test for trend was not significant (p=0*13). To evaluate this association further the relative risk for men with a body mass index ^28 kg/m2 (those in the highest tenth) compared with men with a body mass index &lt;20 kg/m2(those in the lowest tenth) was calculated as 2*32 (95% confidence interval 0*99 to 5-46). table I?Relative risks (adjusted for age) and 95% confidence intervals for prostatic cancer associated with selected anthropomorphic measurements taken at first examination of Japanese men in Hawaii, 1965-86 No of No of Relative Confidence cases controls risk intervals Body mass index: 0-22-49 53 2573 1-00 22-50-24-49 57 2478 123 085 to 179 ^25 64 2769 1-33 092 to 192 Skinfold thickness of left triceps (mm): 0-6 64 2832 100 7-8 51 2187 100 069 to 144 ^9 59 2801 0-94 066 to 133 Girth of left upper arm (cm): 0-26 47 2399 100 27-29 83 3274 159 111 to 229 =?30 44 2151 1-49 098 to 226 Skinfold thickness under left scapula (mm): 0-12 52 2583 100 13-19 67 2719 134 093 to 192 =?20 55 2519 1-27 087 to 186 Biacromial diameter (cm): 0-37 73 3065 100 38-39 65 3040 104 074tol45 =?40 36 1716 1-22 081 to 184 Weight (kg): 0-58-9 55 2555 100 590-67-9 73 2867 147 104 to 2-10 =568-0 46 2398 128 086 to 190 Height when sitting (cm): 0-85 70 2710 1-00 86-87 48 2249 097 067 to 141 =?88 56 2861 094 066 to 134 Leg length (cm)*: 0-74 61 2882 100 75-77 54 1962 141 098 to 204 ??78 59 2973 124 086 to 179 *Height when standing minus height when sitting. Subjects whose left upper arm had a girth of ^27 cm had higher risks of prostatic cancer than subjects with girths of &lt;27 cm, but the increase in risk was not linear. When age and the girth of the left upper arm were controlled for, the positive association between body mass index and prostatic cancer decreased sub? stantially. When age and body mass index were con? trolled for, the risk associated with the girth of the left upper arm remained essentially unchanged. Table II shows the risk of prostatic cancer associated with the estimated areas of muscle and fat in the arm. Risk increased significantly (p=0*026) with increasing area of muscle in the arm but was not related to the area of fat in the arm (p=0*996). The estimates of risk for subjects whose area of muscle in the arm was 4650-5549 mm2 and ^5550 mm2 were similar, suggest? ing that the relation between the area of muscle in the arm and prostatic cancer was not linear. To examine this further the data on area of muscle in the arm were evaluated by logarithmic transformation and inverse transformation (table III).

Discussion Little is known about the cause of prostatic cancer. We found a positive association between body mass index and the incidence of prostatic cancer, which is consistent with results of previous studies. In addition, we evaluated the associations between different types of body tissue and prostatic cancer. Both fat and lean tissue are reflected in the body mass index.8 The area of muscle in the arm was signifi? cantly associated with an increased risk of prostatic cancer, but there was no association between the area of fat in the arm and prostatic cancer. As these two measurements are the most accurate indicators of adipose and lean body tissue5 6 our results suggest that lean tissue rather than body fat may play a part in the development of prostatic cancer. In addition, although we consider the results presented in table III to be preliminary, they suggest that the risk of prostatic cancer increases with increasing mass of muscle only up to a certain point, after which it remains constant. We have no firm suggestion for a biological mechanism that might explain these findings. The normal growth and functioning of the prostate are influenced by sex hormones.9 Experimental studies suggest that testosterone has a role in starting carcino genesis of the prostate in animals.10 Cancer is most likely to develop in the peripheral parenchyma of the prostate, which is more dependent on androgen than is the central area. " Androgens (anabolic steroids) affect muscle mass and are used by athletes who wish to increase the development of their muscles.12 Endogenous overproduction of androgens has little obvious effect in men, although it can lead to hyper? trophy of skeletal muscle and virilism in women.13 Increased muscle development in some men may perhaps reflect overproduction of sex hormones, especially hypers?cr?tion of androgens by the adrenal cortex.1415 If this imbalance was maintained for long enough it might lead to an increased risk of prostatic cancer. This, however, is speculation, and further research is necessary before firm conclusions can be drawn.
