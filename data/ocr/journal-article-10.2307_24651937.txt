INTRODUCTION The ancient city of Torone faces west near the southern end of the Sithonia peninsula, the central finger of three-pronged Chalcidice jutting south from Macedonia between the Thermaic gulf and the Strymon river valleys (fig. I).1 The prominence of the site in Classical history, where it played an important role in northern campaigns of the Peloponnesian War, inspired excavations by the Athens Archaeological Society between 1975 and 1984, under the direction of Professor Alexander Cambitoglou of the University of Sydney, and since 1986 as a collaboration of the Athens Archaeological Society and the Australian Archaeological Institute at Athens.2 The most prominent headland of the site (Promontory 1: figs. 2-3), called Lekythos in antiquity,3 was first explored in the 1970s, and became the exclusive focus of excavations since 1986, in part for the prehistoric settlement located in this area. The presence of prehistoric material at Torone was first signalled by Nikolaos Kotzias in 1939 and confirmed by David French, who collected over 60 prehistoric sherds on the surface of the Lekythos promontory in 1965.4 In the first three seasons of excavations, a decade later. Bronze Age artefacts were found re-deposited in Byzantine and post-Byzantine levels, primarily in Trench 2 on Promontory 1; thirty-eight sherds were published in the first volume of those excavations, with a thorough discussion of prehistoric Torone that * Note the following abbreviations, in addition to the usual ones: S.

Paspalas, 'Torone 2007', Bulletin of the Australian Archaeological Institute at Athens 4, 2006/2007, 9-10, but settlement levels in these early periods are restricted to the Lekythos. 7 The invitation to publish the Bronze Age pottery from Torone (1986-1990) was generously extended by Professor Alexander Cambitoglou, to whom I am deeply grateful for the privilege and opportunity, as well as for logistical support since 1993. Drawings prepared from 1986 to 1990 were executed or supervised by Anne Hooton, with additional work by Freya Evenson in 2005 and Tina Ross in 2008. Stavros Paspalas and Beatrice McLoughlin provided primary assistance in Torone, Polygyros, and Sydney, and Jan Verstraaten helped find joins in context pottery during a study season. The field notebooks and preliminary reports of 1986 to 1990, and the interpretative skills of John K. Papadopoulos, trench supervisor during those seasons, contributed in enormous part to my interpretation of stratigraphy and settlement. Among visitors to Torone who provided invaluable assistance with prehistoric material, I would like to thank Ioannis Aslanis, Stelios Andreou, Bernhard Hansel, Wolf-Dieter Niemeier, and Jeremy Rutter. In addition, Andreou and Rutter were kind enough to read this article and offer much-needed criticism and corrections, not all of which I may have heeded. My research during study seasons (1993-1995) was funded by the Australian Research Council, the Foundation for Classical Archaeology, and by the Academic Senate of the University of California, Los Angeles; the National Endowment for the Humanities, USA, provided a senior research fellowship at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens in 2004-2005. Final publication will include the analysis of stone tools (by Ernestine Elster), faunal remains (by the late Sandor B5konyi), plant remains (by Dr Evi Margariti), and marine mollusks (by Dr Deborah Ruscillo).</page><page sequence="3">Prehistoric Tor one 3 published here offers an overview of the ceramic repertoire of prehistoric Torone and a preview of fuller presentation in the final publication. As a natural rock promontory flanked today by two small bays as good landing sites (pi. I: 1), the site occupied by prehistoric Torone may have enjoyed an even deeper and more sheltered anchorage to the north, hidden from the main southern seaward approach, according to recent determination of its palaeogeography.8 Even in its present shape it strongly resembles promontories that attracted settlement in the earliest Bronze Age at other coastal sites of the Aegean, as at Kolonna on Aegina, Askitario, Ayios Kosmas, and Ayia Marina, all in Attica; at Manika on Euboea, Mitrou in eastern Locris, Ayia Irini on Kea; Pefkakia Magoula near Volos, Myrina on Lemnos, and at Besik Tepe and Troy in Asia Minor (fig. 4). This kinship also differentiates Torone from prehistoric sites of central Macedonia such as Kastanas and Assiros (fig. 1), located on rivers or lake basins and formed by centuries of accumulation in true toumba or mound style. Architecture at Torone likewise distinguishes the settlement from inland mound sites (dominated by wattle-and-daub plus occasional mud bricks) with its stone socles supporting mud-brick walls since the Early Bronze Age (also found at Skala Sotiros on Thasos, and later in the Bronze Age at Toumba Thessaloniki and Arkhontiko). Finally, in its artefacts as well, Torone, like Bronze Age Chalcidice in general, shows fewer connections to the rich prehistory of the Balkans common since the Neolithic in western Macedonia or Thrace (Dikili Tas, Sitagroi) and belongs instead more closely to the coastal and island Aegean world, much like Skala Sotiros on Thasos. Thus Torone occupies an important point along the interface between Macedonia, with its more Balkan-oriented culture, and the international network of the Aegean that flourished since the Final Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages. Often classified with other sites of Central Macedonia, Chalcidice deserves to be defined instead, in terms of geography and history, as a separate enclave in Aegean prehistory, as argued years ago by Walter Abel Heurtley.9 The heart of settlement in the Bronze Age as well as the Early Iron Age, Promontory 1 was defended, during one or both of these eras, on the landward side across the isthmus by a defensive wall of schist slabs set in mud mortar, visible at both ends and traced in Figure 2.

Nevertheless, intact strata from the Early and Middle Bronze Age, along with material from the 3rd and 2nd millennia re-deposited in later levels, make Torone one of the longest-lived sites in Chalcidice. However, without continuous strata, it is not possible to trace occupation levels across the settlement and in sections as prehistoric 'phases'. Nor can a system defining levels by architectural phases, as adopted for Kastanas (with mixed results) or Ayios Mamas, be presented without an urban layout of complete structures and streets. Statistical analysis of relative proportions of ceramic wares, as conducted at Kastanas, Toumba Thessaloniki, and Ayios Mamas, is not feasible with such a small sample of stratified finds and such a large proportion of re-deposited sherds. Shape studies are limited by the infrequency of whole vessels in closed deposits, and by the absence thus far of a prehistoric necropolis (Early Iron Age burials on Terrace V above the Lekythos [V on fig. 2] begin in the Sub-Mycenaean period).12 Instead, a series of deposits forms the basis for identifying at least six phases of occupation, distributed across six trenches, from 10 J.

Prehistoric levels at Torone point unequivocally to a settlement: in addition to domestic pottery, items such as stone tools, clay household objects (spindle whorls, spools, etc.), plant remains, and animal bones belong to an architectural context of houses with hearths, industrial platforms, and shell middens. Ceramics are predominantly local and handmade, implying a community that supplied itself with basic household pottery and domestic equipment. Yet ceramics imported from central or southern Greece and the north Aegean during critical periods—a Trojan style face lid and sauceboats in the Early Bronze Age, wheelmade Minyan in the Middle Bronze Age, and Early Mycenaean pottery of the Shaft Grave period, along with other exotica (ivory, hippo tusk), make this more than a modest, isolated beach-head. As a prominent headland flanked by shores appropriate for beaching prehistoric ships, just north of a large, deep protected harbour (Porto Koupho, the classical Kouphos litnen and main Roman harbour),13 Torone may have served a constellation of coastal sites active throughout the Aegean Bronze Age. This role emerged at a time when settlement shifted from inland farming during the Neolithic towards maritime locales linked to a wider network of trade and interaction, a complex process spanning the Final Neolithic (Chalcolithic) period and escalating in the Early Bronze Age.14 Crucial resources may have directed activity to this area of coastal Macedonia, encouraged settlement at Torone and other sites since the Early Bronze Age, and sustained links with the wider world of the Aegean, thanks to substantial mineral deposits in northern Greece, in quantity and quality critical to the Bronze Age (fig. 5). Mines of gold, silver, and copper worked in eastern Chalcidice in Byzantine and Ottoman times are still productive today.15 Several sources of galena ore and silver identified in modern geological research Figure 4.

Finally, both alluvial gold (in the Gallikos and Axios rivers and their tributaries (fig. 5: Au 3-4), and the Langada Basin near Assiros (fig. 5 : Au 5) and at least three sources of gold in mixed mineral deposits in Chalcidice (fig. 5: Au 6-7-8) should not be neglected, given prehistoric gold ornaments from Saratse, Kilindir, Kastanas, and Toumba Thessaloniki, where a stone mould-crucible also indicates local gold working in the Late Bronze Age.19 Indeed, as has been argued, the very name of the three-part promontory, Chalcidice, means 'place of copper/metal,' more plausibly traced to these mineral riches than to the city of Chalcis on Euboea, alleged to have founded colonies here in the first millennium bc.20 The emergence of important prehistoric settlements in Chalcidice, first uncovered by Heurtley in the 1920s and now amplified by discoveries at Kriaritsi, Polychrono, Siveri, and Skione as well as Torone, in fact support this origin for the name of Chalcidice, and help date its onset to the Early Bronze Age.21 Over two thousand years before Chalcis in Euboea became a colonizing city, this area's chief attraction may have been its metals, whose exploitation linked coastal sites like Torone to long-term, long-distance trade. As at Ayios Mamas, a settlement moved to the sea from Neolithic Olynthus in the Early Bronze Age, occupation at Torone and Kriaritsi mark a coastal re-location of resources and activities in the Bronze Age, perhaps from Neolithic Sykia, as the result of a cultural and technological revolution that der Symbolgehalt von Waffen in der ersten Hiilfte des 3.

Morris began in the Final Neolithic. While Torone itself does not demonstrate secure Chalcolithic levels, its earliest ceramics echo forms that signal this aggressive age of transformation (rolled-rim bowls, 'Bratislava' lid/bowls, pierced lug handles, white-on-dark paint: see below, Phase I). Prehistoric metal objects are rare in Torone: a single copper-alloy pin survived in two fragments from the earliest levels (EB I) reached in Trench 67/68 (M90.76 and M90.78), resembling those found by Heurtley at Kritsana and Vardina. No slag, moulds or tools for metalworking were found to date that would demonstrate a direct local role in the production of early metallurgy. Instead, Torone may have been an 'emporion', a landing place, provisioning station, or export harbour for local riches in copper, silver, and lead, as well as other resources such as timber and fish.22 In this capacity, the promontory served as a conspicuous (possibly fortified) port for coastal, maritime traffic aimed at inland resources exchanged for imports. Such a role continued into the Early Iron Age, when Torone may have been a 'skala' or coastal stage for traffic to and from inland Koukos (Sykia), a settlement with abundant evidence for extracting and producing metals.23 For two to three millennia prior to Greek colonization of Chalcidice, a settlement on a promontory of the central peninsula supported a steady population and perhaps an equally steady flow of Aegean-wide visitors. Other Bronze Age sites identified along coastal Chalcidice—Polychrono, Skione and Siveri on Kassandra, Ayios Mamas at the head of the Toronian gulf, Kastri at Nikiti, Kriaritsi near Sykia at the south end of the Sithonia peninsula and several sites (Pyrgos-Mutari/Singos) east of the isthmus of the same peninsula—testify to its emergence as a major destination since the Early Bronze Age.24 The recognition of such locales, satellites to larger forces in the Aegean, is important to understanding the prehistory of Greece in the Chalcolithic and Bronze Ages. Crucial features of prehistoric Torone are its close and constant connections to Aegean activity in central and southern Greece, the island culture of the Aegean, and coastal Asia Minor, from the Early to Late Bronze Ages. It is hoped that increased awareness of the location and life of Bronze Age Torone will enrich ongoing studies of prehistoric sites and patterns in the archaeology of the Aegean, and lead to a more inclusive treatment of northern Aegean sites. Along with Palamari on Skyros, Pevkakia Magoula near Volos in Thessaly, and the islands of Lesbos and Lemnos, Torone and related sites of Chalcidice became major players in the maritime dynamics of the north Aegean Bronze Age. II. THE EXCAVATIONS OF 1986-1990 A brief summary of the excavated areas that produced prehistoric material will introduce this study. Six trenches were laid out on the Lekythos between 1986 and 1990 (fig. 3), of which only two (Trenches 72 and 74) were explored to bedrock, with patches of bedrock reached in 22 The term 'emporion' here indicates a harbour settlement with prehistoric contacts beyond Chalcidice, as used in the International Aegaeum conference {infra, n. 69). rather than in its later meanings: M.

Prehistoric levels exposed as stratified deposits in four of the trenches, outlined below, represent six phases of the Bronze Age; a list of all prehistoric deposits and their inventoried finds will appear in the final catalogue, of which a selection is presented here. SUMMARY OF TRENCHES All areas of the Lekythos explored between 1986 and 1990 were also occupied from Early Iron Age to post-Byzantine times: thus prehistoric deposits could only be reached between and under walls, pits, and structures belonging to these subsequent occupation phases. In particular, settlement on the promontory in the Early Iron Age included storage facilities consisting of large pithoi set deep into earlier levels or even bedrock (figs. 8, 9), which destroyed much of the uppermost Late Bronze Age levels. The density of prehistoric artefacts and architecture recovered, despite these circumstances, testifies to a permanent settlement with substantial structures that once covered most of the promontory. Trench 67 and 68 (fig. 6) These two trenches, opened as adjacent units and combined during the last two seasons of excavation, produced several important levels of the Bronze Age. 1. A structure of the Early Bronze Age, defined by a hearth (Feature C) and a clay platform with post holes (Feature D), is associated with three successive occupation floors (Units 136, 141, and 142) and accompanied by several layers of domestic debris (Units 129-135). Radiocarbon samples collected from Units 141 and 142 could unfortunately not be dated. In addition, successive floors with post holes reach back into the earliest Bronze Age (Units 172-185), eventually levelled up with decayed mud bricks for the construction of Wall 24 and Feature E (an apsidal wall surrounding a shell midden) in the Early Bronze Age (fig. 7, pi. I: 2). Radiocarbon dates for this earliest phase range from 3034 to 2706 bc. Figure 6.

An early phase of the Middle Bronze Age survives in a floor with two pithoi (Units 104 105) and deposits associated with Wall 23 and its paved extension, Feature A (Units 109-112, 114-117; fig. 6). 3. A -shaped structure (defined by Walls 9, 10, and 16), with external surfaces in Units 94 98, 124-125, represents the transition from the Middle to the Late Bronze Age (fig. 6). Trench 69 (fig. 8). Two stratified phases were identified by the end of the 1990 season: 1. An Early Bronze Age house of mud-brick walls (Walls 13, 15, 16) on a stone socle, roofed with wooden beams and battens found fallen and burned (Units 124-125, 129-134) was excavated in 1986 as Units 35, 40, 41, 44, 53, above Units 59, 61-62 (pi. II: 1). A sample of carbonized wood collected from Unit 44 in 1986, analysed at the Macintosh Centre for Quartenary Dating at the University of Sydney, yielded a calibrated date of 2170-1675 bc; additional samples collected from the same level (Unit 132) in 1990 and analysed at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences produced a series of seven calibrated dates ranging from 3034 to 2586 bc. 2. A structure defined by Wall 14, its floor and hearth (with firepit) dates from late in the Early Bronze Age, or the transition from the Early to the Middle Bronze Age (Units 88, 89, 91, 94, 95, 98, 99); deposits below this hearth (Units 112-118) continued this level above the burnt floor of the Early Bronze Age house. Trench 72 (fig. 9) At least three critical phases of the prehistoric settlement at Torone appeared in this trench. 1. An Early Bronze Age occupation transformed a bedrock slope into a floor (Units 99, 102, 103) with hearth (Feature 3, Units 88 and 92) in the north-east sector. A similar floor is much more poorly preserved in the south-west part of the trench (Units 90, 95, 97, 98, and 100). These deposits contain the earliest pottery found at Torone to date, but unfortunately no burnt material that might have yielded radiocarbon dates.</page><page sequence="11">Prehistoric Torone 11 Figure 8.

A wall (Feature 2) exposed on its south-west face and preserved for a length of 1.70 m dates to the Middle Bronze Age (Units 81, 84; inventoried pottery primarily Early Bronze Age). 3. Patches of Middle Bronze Age occupation were also recovered in 1988, in the form of Feature 1 (Unit 30), and a mud-brick wall, plus a post hole (Unit 37). Trench 74 (fig. 10) In 1989, Trench 74 was opened some 35 metres north of existing trenches to determine the extent of occupation on the Lekythos in the prehistoric and classical eras, and was dug to bedrock in two seasons. Patches of Early Bronze Age occupation directly over bedrock, and many re-deposited Middle Bronze Age finds, trace the prehistoric settlement on the Lekythos at least this far north; deep placement of Early Iron Age pithoi (cf. fig. 11) left no Late Bronze Age levels intact. A significant deposit of smashed vessels in the N/NE corner (Units 186, 196, 200, 202), primarily large, heavy coarse wares, dates to the Early Bronze Age. Figure 10. Trench 74 at end of 1990 season: El A pithos nest among later walls. 1: 50. Trench 61/62 (fig. 11) This trench lies inside the medieval tower of the Byzantine/post-Byzantine fortifications, the southernmost point explored on the Lekythos. Below Classical houses and Archaic levels emerged important remains of the Early Iron Age settlement, defined by four large storage pithoi set into earth floors, some fixed into the only Late Bronze Age horizon to survive later activity on the Lekythos (Units 104-106, 110-118). Re-deposited Bronze Age material in this trench includes some of the finest Late Mycenaean pottery from Torone, as well as one of the few possible Minoan imports (fig. 48: 90.70). As excavations in this area were not completed to bedrock, intact layers of the Bronze Age may well lie below the last surfaces exposed when excavations ended in 1990.</page><page sequence="13">Prehistoric Torone 13 NE i SW i WALL GD ■WALL L Figure 11.

EARLY BRONZE AGE I (FIGS. 12-17, 23) Levels of the earliest phase of the Early Bronze Age survived in the north-east sector of Trench 72 in an early floor and hearth (Units 88 and 92) with patches of a contemporary surface in the south-west part of the trench (Units 90, 95, 97, 98, and 100). This represents the earliest period of occupation recovered on the Lekythos promontory, which evidently did not extend as far north as Trench 74 (where no such levels were found over bedrock). Significant examples of related shapes and fabric survive in equivalent levels of other trenches, particularly in Trench 67/68 just above bedrock (Units 172-185). Few architectural features survive from this phase, beyond an earthen floor with a hearth made of a round schist slab enclosed by mud bricks and small stones in Trench 72 (fig. 9, Feature 3) and a raised clay platform surrounded by post holes (Feature D) in Trench 67/68 (pi. I: 2). Lithics, animal bone, and shell indicate domestic occupation; no carbon samples could be collected from this phase as found in Trench 72, but related levels which produced samples in Trench 67/68 can be dated to the early 3rd millennium BC.</page><page sequence="14">14 Sarah P. Morris A distinctive fabric characterizes fine wares daring this phase, consisting of a dark, fine matrix with even grey core, much white grit and mica, and a burnished surface ranging in colour from dark olive-green to black to an oxidized version of the same fabric (with some examples fired bright red, resembling the 'strawberry red' of the Final Neolithic), all features separating it from later phases of the Early Bronze Age with their red-brown-black mottled fabrics. As yet, few coarse wares have been identified from this phase. The most common shape is a shallow bowl with incurving profile and thin 'rolled' rim on a flat or rounded base (fig. 12), as well as bowls with horizontal lug handles outside and just below the rim, often corrugated or pierced (figs. 13-14), occasionally 'horned' with projections at each end ('trumpet lugs').26 Also frequent are carinated and shouldered bowls (fig. 15), some with a S-profile wall, one with high-swung strap handle (89.1961). 'Mastos decoration' appears in plastic nipples on the exterior walls of larger shapes, straight-walled or ovoid jars with pierced rim, commonly called 'cheese pots'. Finally, painted decoration typical of Chalcidice in this period appears primarily in fugitive white on black on shallow bowls (plates) reminiscent of Neolithic forms, with some examples of black and red diagonal bands (fig. 12). In local terms, this phase corresponds to the earliest levels (I/II) at Kritsana (where painted 'Neolithic' sherds were found together with Early Bronze vessels), and overlaps with the later Blue period at Poliochni on Lemnos.27 This transitional phase also appears at Myrina IV and Koukounisi on Lemnos, at Emporio V-IV on Chios, and on Samos at Pythagoreion. In northern Greece, phases IV and Va at Sitagroi overlap with the early settlement at Torone, which may predate the oldest levels at Kastanas (Schicht 28), but compares to the 33d half meter in Pits D and E uncovered by Heurtley at Ayios Mamas. It seems best to compare this period at Torone to such local phases of Early Bronze I, without equating it precisely to any corresponding era in the central or southern Aegean. A Final Neolithic (Chalcolithic) phase proper is not yet evident at Torone nor at any of the coastal sites investigated by Heurtley, thus one must date the onset of settlement on the Lekythos promontory at the turn from the fourth to the third millennium.28 Throughout Chalcidice, settlement shifted at that time slightly but significantly from nearby inland sites to the coast, for example from Neolithic Olynthos to Ayios Mamas (once much closer to the sea), or near Ayios Nikolaos from Vetrino to Singos (Pyrgos), and even perhaps to Torone and Kriaritsi from Neolithic Sykia. Neolithic-style painted wares (fig. 12) White-on-black and red-on-black painted wares were classified with the Late Neolithic by Heurtley in western Macedonia at Servia, and in Chalcidice at Ayios Mamas and Kritsana.29 26 First found at Torone in Trench 2 in 1978 (Torone I 282 no. 3/2: 78.1319, fig. 47 pi. 47), this type of handle and bowl are fully discussed by S. Hood, Excavations in Chios 1938 1955. Prehistoric Emborio and Ayio Gala I. BSA Suppl. 15 (1981) 173-5. 21 Heurtley xvi: at Kritsana, '...Late Neolithic sherds lay side by side with Early Bronze in the lowest settlements'; p. xx: 'in the two lowest settlements Late Neolithic painted ware was found in almost equal proportion with Early Bronze'; p. 22 fig. 21; A. Dova, 'Μύρινα Λήμνου- Οι αρχαιότερες φάσεις του προϊστορικού οικισμού', in Doumas-La Rosa 282-96: Myrina I—III correspond to the Black period at Poliochni, and only the final phase IV overlaps with the first levels at Torone. Aslanis 293, blames abandonment and reoccupation for mixing older (Neolithic) material with that of the Early Bronze Age at Kritsana and Ayios Mamas, hence the false impression of 'continuity'; equally possibly is the survival of some Neolithic/Chalcolithic styles of shape and decoration into the Early Bronze Age ceramic industry in the Chalcidice. See J. Maran, Kulturwandel auf dem griechischen Festland und den Kykladen im spateren 3. Jahrtausend v. Chr. (1998) 111-12, on Chalcolithic Chalcidice. This supersedes Andreou et al. 306; Cambitoglou art. cit. (n. 10) 22 n. 4; Papadopoulos 2005, xvii, 589, as reports of a Neolithic phase at Torone. Radiocarbon analysis of charcoal samples from Torone, performed by the Institute of Nuclear Research at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1991, yielded calibrated dates for samples from Trench 67/68 of 3034-2910 BC (Sample DEB 1840, Unit 181) and 4 dates for Sample DEB 1850 from Unit 180 (3026-2994, 2928-2876. 2802-2760, and 2714-2706 BC). 29 Heurtley 70-1.</page><page sequence="15">Prehistoric Torone 15 However, he found these painted and other 'Neolithic' wares at Kritsana 'in almost equal proportion with Early Bronze' in the two earliest levels at the site. At Torone, a few painted examples derive from directly over bedrock and were found in the same units with shapes and fabrics typical of Heurtley's earliest Bronze Age examples at Kritsana. Several examples of rolled rim bowls (fig. 12: 89.1866) represent a shape characteristic around the Aegean in the on Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age. Painted decoration at Torone appears on a shallow bowl (or plate) with rounded underside, thickened ribbed rim and black polished surface, painted in white bands diagonally across the rim, inner and outer surfaces (fig. 12: 89.817). The shape recalls Neolithic plates with diagonally channelled rim of the Vinca culture in the Balkans, also found in Sitagroi I—III, and 'Bratislava bowls' of the Chalcolithic.31 The decorative scheme also repeats earlier painted Neolithic styles, including crusted (Rachmani phase) decoration in Thessaly, and anticipates the incised and white-filled patterns on black-burnished shapes characteristic of the Early Bronze Age II at Torone (fig. 21).32 Examples of black-on-red paint typical of Kritsana, where it is contemporary with white-on-black, sometimes on the same vessels, also appear at Torone.33 Bowl with incurving rim and horizontal lug handles (figs. 13-14) This bowl and its handle types are common throughout northern Greece in the Early Bronze Age, but not present in the same fabrics at Kastanas as in Chalcidice.34 The shape endures into the following EB II phase at Torone, especially with the lug pierced, and without the characteristic 'rolled rim' profile. Examples of a taller, deeper cup with S-profile find parallels at northern Greek sites (fig. 15: 89.1961, 90.1238). Carinated bowl (fig. 15) This shape is typical of the first phase of the Early Bronze Age in many locales of prehistoric Greece, from the Peloponnese to northern Greece, including variants with applied flattened mastoi as at Torone (90.1514, 90.1178).35 Deep bowl (fig. 16) A series of deep bowls with applied mastoi, along with a shallow basin resembling shapes of the Neolithic period, completes the repertoire of Early Bronze I open shapes from Trench 30 Rolled-rim bowls were first identified at Kum Tepe IB in the Troad, with parallels from Poliochni and Troy: J.

Morris 67/68 at Torone.36 The base of one bowl (90.967) is unusually decorated underneath, with a flattened pellet and incised lines that seem to imitate vine-leaf impressions, often found beneath Early Bronze Age bowls in Crete and the Cyclades.37 Ovoid or hole-mouthed jar with incurved pierced rim (fig. 17) This large jar with pierced rim continues the 'cheese-pot' of the Final Neolithic and functions as the basic storage vessel of the earliest Bronze Age at Torone.38 Ladle or shallow cup with high strap handle (fig. 23) This shallow open vessel with rounded underside and vertical ribbed strap handle (90.925 and 1161) has a raised omphalos in the centre of the floor, as well as a distinctive dark brown fabric, heavily burnished, that associates it with the earliest phase of the Bronze Age at Torone.39 The shape continues until the next phase of the Bronze Age, as well, in at least one miniature form (86.224). PHASE II. EARLY BRONZE AGE II (FIGS. 18-29) This period, the most active and widespread throughout the Aegean in the third millennium, survives in a number of scattered deposits at Torone. A pottery smash found over bedrock in the north-east corner of Trench 74 (Unit 200, 202, including joins with Units 186 and 196 build-up over this collapse), contained a number of signal shapes (fig. 8). They are identified here in terms of types named at Kastanas, without adhering strictly to the sub-categories (largely based on size) determined for that site. They overlap in shape and style with pottery found in Trench 69 associated with the structure of mud-brick walls on a stone socle and burnt wooden roof (fig. 8, pi. II: 1). Finally, contemporary shapes and fabrics were found in Trench 67/68 with a structure defined by Wall 24, a hearth (Feature C), and a clay platform, stratified on three floors in Units 136, 141-142 = 170-171 and in associated deposits (Units 129-135) (figs. 6-7, pi. I: 2). The range of vessels in Trench 74 is repeated in more complex constellations of deposits found over Early Bronze Age floors in Trenches 67/68 and 69; links throughout these levels in shapes and fabrics that define an Early Bronze Age II horizon at Torone. This era overlaps with classic phases of Early Bronze Age II in the Aegean (Lerna III, Kolonna Stadt II—III on Aegina), phases III and IV at Kritsana, Sitagroi Vb, as well as the Green and Red periods at Poliochni. At Kastanas, levels 24-27 correspond primarily to the middle centuries of the 3rd millennium, or this second phase of the Early Bronze Age at Torone, and the Kastanas terminology of ceramic types is borrowed here for the sake of closer parallels. 36 Cf.

Horizontal lug handles below the rim or high-swung ring handles afford a firm grasp, and applied nipples often decorate the exterior, both features also found in Early Bronze Age I at Torone (figs. 13-14). Fabric is heavier and sandier than in the first phase of the Early Bronze Age, with none of the glossy olive to black surfaces inherited from the Neolithic in the earlier phase. The surface is smoothed and often burnished (where visible in less worn examples), and ranges in colour from red to brown and black (often mottled); examples range from heavier utilitarian versions like 90.983, a sturdy vessel for serving liquids or stews, to finer, smaller shapes for drinking purposes with ring handles which rise above the rim and terminate in pointed horns (90.1311). Not found in northern Greece are the footed or pedestalled 'saucers' common in central and southern Greece. Small bowl (cup) with incurving rim (fig. 19) This type represents a smaller bowl, cup-sized, with horizontal handles, round in section, rising above the rim. Examples without preserved handle details could belong to any category of bowl with incurving rim.40 Bowl with flaring wall (fig. 20) This bowl41 is common at Early Bronze Age sites in Chalcidice and adjacent areas, with a sloping wall and flat rim decorated with slashes laid diagonally across the lip. Special Shapes and Fabrics Incised, white-filled decoration (fig. 21) A common form of decoration in Early Bronze Age northern Greece, especially in Chalcidice, appears on small open shapes, burnished black and incised with lines (primarily cross-hatched triangles and lozenges) filled with white paste. First identified at Kritsana by Heurtley, it also appears at Kastanas, Ayios Mamas, Vardarofsta/Axiochori, and elsewhere in Macedonia.42 A survivor of white-on-dark painted and incised wares of the latest Neolithic, this style is also found on Lemnos (Myrina), Thasos (Skala Sotiros), and in Anatolia.43 Such decoration is reserved for small open vessels, whose fabric resembles closely that of other local EBI shapes, and whose form also follows local bowls (incurving rim, flaring wall, etc.). At Torone, 8 examples of this fabric and decoration turned up in Early Bronze Age levels in Trenches 67/68 and 69, of which 3 are illustrated here. Sauceboat (fig. 21) An important local connection to southern and island Greece in the 3rd millennium is indicated by rim fragments of three imported sauceboats, found in middle levels of the Early 40 Kastanas: Aslanis 74-5 fig. 37, Schale 5.1; Ayios Mamas: Heurtley 171 no. 178 = Aslanis pis. 107: 1; 111: 3; 112: 3; Kritsana V-VI: Heurtley 22 fig. 21 (cf.

These vessels are distinctive enough in fabric (fine clay, hard fired, and bright red surfaces, all typical of Urfirnis ware) and profile to make them imports; their presence provides important synchronisms for these levels at Torone with Early Helladic phases in southern Greece.44 Three possible local examples stem from Trench 69 (above the burnt building of the Early Bronze Age) and from Trench 74. Lid (fig. 22) Two examples of Early Bronze Age lids in local fabric are distinguished by relief decoration in one case (90.322) and a triangular handle on the other (90.418). Both have close parallels in the Troad, and point to connections across the north Aegean.45 Figurine (fig. 22) Among the important artefacts discovered in Trench 67/68 was a small female figurine (89.1000) of a type common throughout Greece in the Early Bronze Age, found here in context near a hearth, shell midden, and platform in levels with fine wares (89.1042, small bowl with incised, white-filled decoration) and domestic pottery like the 'barrel-vessel' (figs. 28-29). This helps confirm the domestic origin and function of such figurines, while linking Torone to other sites in northern Greece in this period.46 Jug (fig. 23)47 A complete jug (86.190) was found in pieces above the Early Bronze Age floor with burnt roof in Trench 69; fragments of similar shapes belong to contemporary levels (EB II) in all trenches (e.g., 90.1317 from Trench 74, and 89.1149 from Trench 67/68). Coarse Wares Storage jar (fig. 24) A common shape of Early Bronze Age Torone is a deep storage jar in various profiles (straight or flaring wall, S-curve, and ovoid) of semi-coarse fabric.48 Most specimens have vertical strap handles, horizontal shelf lug handles on the upper wall, and slashed or notched decoration on the lip; many rims and handles were identified but few whole jars. A significant deposit of storage jars and pithoi from the Early Bronze Age floor in Trench 69 (Unit 61) provides nearly-whole examples of each shape in this category. 44 On this form and its function, probably related to wine, see J.

Ovoid jar with strap handles (figs. 25-26)50 A shape related in form and function to the straight-walled storage jar is ovoid or hole mouthed in profile, decorated with applied nipples or shelf lug handles, most likely for cooking or serving thick liquids or stews. The most complete example (90.865, with single raised strap handle) was found with the Early Bronze Age hearth in Trench 67/68; others stem from nearly every Early Bronze Age domestic context in all trenches, and the shape continues in the next phase. Another variant of this vessel has an S-profile wall, vertical lug handles (Ohrengriffe) and is decorated with finger-impressed relief bands. It lasts until the end of the Middle Bronze Age, or Phase V at Torone (fig. 42). Porous water jar. striated fabric (fig. 27)51 Familiar in form and fabric from Early Bronze Age sites in northern Greece, this distinctive type of container (usually a two-handled jar or amphora, plus a few larger pithos-sized jars) has been identified as a vessel especially prepared for extra porosity, probably to keep its liquid contents cool. Made of heavy but thin-walled fabric, 'sandy' in colour and texture (tempered with fine quartz as grit), these tall, narrow-necked jars and amphorae were designed to allow air to circulate through their walls and draw moisture towards the exterior, which kept contents cool through evaporation.52 This was achieved not only by admixture of sand and absence of dense clay or lime in the fabric but by sweeping inner and outer surfaces, before firing, with a fine brush or comb of close-set fibers, leaving tracks like that of a broom (hence the nickname Besenstrich, or 'broomstroke,' for this fabric). This kind of striated or 'scored' ware (not to be confused with the heavier, deeply scored fabrics of 'barrel' vessels: see below) is known from Troy, Kastanas, the north Aegean, and as far south as Samos; an example found in a kiln at Ayios Mamas suggests local manufacture.53 In addition to the best-preserved example from the pottery smash in Trench 74, fragments of this water-jar type came from all levels of the Early Bronze Age in Trench 69 (Units 35, 53, 84, 86, 89-90, 101) and Trench 67/68, in both trenches above the floor of the burnt Early Bronze Age building. Barrel vessel (churn?) (figs. 28-29) One of the most unusual vessels of the Early Bronze Age household in the north Aegean is shaped like a barrel, probably based on a wooden prototype, made of heavy fabric with burnished exterior and deeply scored interior faces. This container has the form of an elongated cylinder, melon-shaped in some repertoires, narrowing towards the extremities, then flaring out slightly to two flat and finished (burnished) ends; it has a single circular 49 Vorratsgefass according to the Kastanas terminology. 50 Corresponding with Kastanas Topf 1 and 4 respectively. 51 At Kastanas: Besenstrich Amphora. 52 Scientific analysis of examples from Sindos demonstrates that the fabric was deliberately prepared this way to increase porosity: M. Kessisoglou-E. A. Mirtsou-I. A. Stratis, 'Συμβολή στήν έρευνα της τεχνολογίας της μακεδονικής κεραμεικής. Πρώιμη εποχή Χαλκού', Anthropologika 7, 1985, 7-16. For discussion of ware and parallels at Troy and Kastanas, see Papadopoulos art. cit (n. 5) 277-8 no. 3/15 fig. 48 pi. 47. At Pevkakia-Magoula (Christmann op. cit. [n. 11] 174-6), Besenstrich describes a system of decoration found on many different shapes, but at Kastanas the term designates surface treatment (Aslanis 92); cf.

Morris opening with neck on one long side (covered with a lid?). First identified in miniature form at Thermi on Lesbos, it resembles portable containers of wood still used by modern herders, suspended and agitated horizontally to make butter from milk, an alternative to the heavier vertical wooden churn more appropriate for non-mobile pastoralists.54 Other liquids proposed for these containers include wine (the deep grooves would catch grape skins, seeds and pips) or oil55, but without residue analysis none of these are certain. The existence of a lid (90.1516) suggests contents were sealed during fermentation or agitation.56 Examples from Lemnos, Troy, Kritsana, and Ayios Mamas indicate wide use of this vessel in the north Aegean?7 Parallels in the Chalcolithic Levant, where the form lasts into the subsequent Early Bronze I phase, were first identified as churns in the 1950s and help explain their function in the Aegean.58 Fragments from Trench 67/68 were scattered through Units 130-135 in debris above successive Early Bronze Age floors (Units 136, 140, 141) and in corresponding levels excavated in 1990 (Units 156-158 and 160-162), often from the same containers. While it has not been possible to restore a complete profile, many belong to a single vessel. Examples present in Trenches 72, 74, and 69 suggest that this type of vessel was common, if not ubiquitous, in domestic assemblages of the Early Bronze Age. Baking pan (fig. 29) This shape (Pfanne at Kastanas) is basically a wide, flat terracotta tray, round or rectangular in form, terminating in a high lip around its edges, which has sometimes been pierced before firing (to admit/release air, or to fasten a lid, it has been suggested).59 The floor of the pan has finger-impressed depressions on its upper surface, presumably to provide support for flat cakes or bread while baking while circulating air underneath, as in the later 'griddle.' 54 Lamb op. cit.

Their small size (11.5 and 8 cm long, respectively) suggests miniatures, like one from Poliochni (on display in Athens, National Museum inv. 7146) or Troy I (infra, n. 57), and in the Chalcolithic Levant. The Torone examples range in end diameter from 12 cm (90.1632) to over 23 cm (86.910) and are estimated to reach 50 cm in length. 55 L. Karali-Ph. Mavridis, Ή Πρώτη εμφάνιση της αμπέλου.

LATER EARLY BRONZE AGE (FIGS. 30-32) An advanced phase of the Early Bronze Age, possibly a transition to the Middle Bronze Age, survives in the structure defined by Wall 14, its floor and hearth, and associated deposits in Trench 69 (Units 88-89, 91, 94, 96-99, 112). This phase of the Early Bronze Age is distinguished by a developed form of a large bowl with sharply in-turned rim (Knickwandschale, or Schale 4 at Kastanas), found in Units 97, 98, 99, 112 (with some joins between units) of Trench 69. These bowls are large, over 40 cm in diameter, with a flaring, steep rather than rounded wall turning in sharply to a flat rim that projects inward with a horizontal lip (fig. 30). Their fabric is heavy in weight and dense in texture, tempered with large white chip inclusions, and mottled in colour, red to black. Several examples were found shattered, then burned, hence their variegated colour. Associated vessels include a jug (fig. 31) and ovoid storage jars (fig. 32): some join fragments from Trench 67/68 (90. 1426 and 1519, not illustrated). Other shapes link Torone to local sites, such as the one-handled cup with three nipples (90.178, fig. 31) and possibly the kantharos (86.265, fig. 22) reburied in a Roman tomb but characteristic of the later phases of the Early Bronze Age at Kastanas and Arkhontiko, while conspicuously rare or absent at sites dated to the middle of the Early Bronze Age.60 Elsewhere in Chalcidice, a single imported EH III patterned-ware sherd from Level VI at Kritsana may link northern Greece to central and southern Greek chronologies.61 Otherwise, Torone and Chalcidice lack vessels distinctive of Early Helladic III in southern Greece ('ouzo cups', tankards, 'Bass' bowls), or the Anatolian depas amphikypellon or jugs with cutaway spouts characteristic of Lefkandi I (Kastri phase), Lerna IV (Early Helladic III), Kolonna IV VI on Aegina, the Yellow period at Poliochni on Lemnos, and Troy III.62 Local deposits may well overlap in time with these phases, but no linking shapes allow synchronisms or certify a true EH III phase, nor indeed the earliest phase of the Middle Bronze Age. Later activity may have disrupted these phases: Early Iron Age pithoi (e.g. 86.309 in Trench 69) were set deeply into Early Bronze Age levels, but one would expect some re-deposited material. This makes it difficult to determine what happened at the end of the 3rd millennium at this site, and whether occupation was interrupted prior to the activity signalled by copious Middle Bronze Age material. 60 One-handled cup: Ayios Mamas (Heurtley 174 no. 201 = Aslanis pi. 112: 11); Myrina, Lemnos: L.

THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE (FIGS. 33-41) The Middle Bronze Age (1st half of the 2nd millennium bc) was first identified by Heurtley in his excavations in Chalcidice at Molyvopyrgos and Ayios Mamas (prehistoric Olynthus) at the head of the Sithonia peninsula. Heurtley's classes of imported (wheelmade) and local (handmade) varieties of 'Minyan' pottery have been confirmed and amplified in excavations at Torone, at Ayios Mamas in the 1990s, as well as in fresh examinations of the old finds from Molyvopyros.63 In addition, re-examination of Heurtley's sequence has refined the phases for this period in northern Greece and synchronized them more closely with those of central and southern Greece.64 While still absent at many north Aegean sites, this phase is now present at Toumba Thessaloniki and at Ayios Mamas (four architectural phases: levels 14-17), and Poliochni's Brown period features three main phases. At Torone, ceramics of the Middle Bronze Age were abundant in every Lekythos trench excavated between 1986 and 1990. Such fabrics were also found well stratified in Trench 67/68 with part of a building (Wall 23), its paving-like extension (Feature A: Units 109-112), and associated deposits (114-117), as well as in 1990 in Unit 150 (fig. 6). Patches of Middle Bronze Age occupation also survived in Trench 72 (Units 30, 79, 81, 83-84) and Trench 69, while Trench 74 produced much Middle Bronze Age pottery re-deposited in later levels. Among these finds, imported wheelmade Minyan shapes, primarily kantharoi and goblets in grey (reduced) and yellow (oxidized) fabrics, but also imported Red and Argive categories (figs. 33-35), are greatly outnumbered by local handmade varieties of the same shapes, in Red (oxidized) and Dark (reduced) fabrics (figs. 36-37, 39-40). They deliberately imitate wheelmade vessels or their metal forebears, with incised horizontal grooves across the exterior body and inside rim of these vessels, simulating wheel-grooves, and false rivets in the form of pellets inside and outside handles (fig. 40: 88.422). Also popular in all local fabrics in both Phases IV and V is a small round bowl with offset rim (figs. 37, 42), with no specific antecedent in wheelmade Minyan shapes, but marked with imitation wheel grooves. In historical terms, the quantity of MBA pottery at Torone with connections to central and southern Greece illustrates a continuity of occupation and contact rare in the Aegean, where settlements were often interrupted, declined, or disappeared after the Early Bronze Age. In northern Greece and in Chalcidice in particular, settlements at Kastanas and Kritsana and cemeteries at Kriaritsi and Skioni are largely phenomena of the Early Bronze Age, while occupation at Assiros in the Axios valley only begins at the end of the Middle Bronze Age. 63 Heurtley 89-92, 208-13 figs. 74-82; Maran op. cit.

Morris Coarse Wares: Pyraunos (fig. 41) In northern Greece, a popular alternative to the three-legged cooking vessel in the Bronze Age was a deep ovoid cooker made in one piece with a 'flaring skirt', placed directly over fire or coals to retain or intensify the heat below food to be cooked.65 At Torone, fragments of a single cooker were found in Trench 67/68 in Middle Bronze Age levels, with other examples from later levels in Trench 62 (the type lasted into the Late Bronze Age at Ayios Mamas and Archontiko and even later, into the Iron Age, at Assiros).

TRANSITION TO THE LATE BRONZE AGE: EARLY MYCENAEAN (FIGS. 42-46) A critical phase of Aegean prehistory, the transition from the Middle to the Late Bronze Age (in southern Greece, the period of the Shaft Graves at Mycenae or roughly Middle Helladic Ill-Late Helladic I), survives at Torone in Trench 67/68 in a Ti-shaped structure (Walls 9, 10, and 16: fig. 6) and Units 94-98, 124-125. This phase is marked by local handmade Minyan successors of Middle Bronze Age shapes (fig. 42), post-dating the period of imported, wheelmade Minyan pottery. The first Mycenaean imports appear, including undecorated shapes (figs. 43-44), and even chipped stone artefacts such as arrowheads that mark the epoch of the Shaft Graves in southern Greece. Meanwhile, some coarse-ware shapes found in context with Early Mycenaean imports and local Minyan imitations continue the profiles and fabrics common in the Early Bronze Age, such as the storage jar with S-profile wall and impressed relief band (fig. 42). The Early Mycenaean material found at Torone in 1988 and 1989 was published in 1993 (16 sherds: figs. 45-46; pi. II: 2);66 additional discoveries from 1990 and earlier are illustrated here (figs. 43-44), along with contemporary (by deposit) Minyan fabrics (fig. 42).67 This co presence of local Minyan with Early Mycenaean imports deserves fresh emphasis, along with repetition of the reasons why this area may have attracted interest from southern Greece.68 The crucial factor, as in the Early Bronze Age, may have been the metal sources of Chalcidice, in this case silver newly valuable in the era of the Shaft Graves for luxury artefacts. One of the possible sources of silver for the Aegean vessels in Shaft Grave Circle A at Mycenae has been identified as that near Stageira in eastern coastal Chalcidice, still Greece's richest source of silver today {supra, nn. 18-19). This would explain the uniquely early Mycenaean imports to this site, comparable only to those found in the West (Italy), also near mineral sources.69 PHASE VI: THE LATE BRONZE AGE, LH IIIA-C (FIGS. 47-54) As outlined earlier, building activity and re-occupation of the Lekythos since the Early Iron Age largely obliterated the uppermost levels of the Bronze Age, leaving nothing comparable to the eleven phases of the Late Bronze Age identified at Ayios Mamas or Schichten 18-12 at Kastanas.70 This makes the era most abundant for Mycenaean pottery throughout the Mediterranean, the most poorly preserved in strata at Torone, of all its prehistoric phases. 66 A.

In addition, examples of local handmade incised and painted pottery of the Late Bronze Age (figs. 53-54) are a reminder of the rich variety of craftsmanship in northern Greece beyond the Mycenaean heartlands. Local products include handmade undecorated examples, distinguished by their unusual shapes, distinctive fabric (sandy grey or brown core, yellow gold surface) and evenly coloured and burnished surfaces from other prehistoric wares, resembling those common in northern Greece in the Late Bronze Age. Conspicuously absent so far from Torone are examples of handmade burnished ware found in Mycenaean contexts throughout the eastern Mediteiranean, including Troy, Cyprus, and Syria, but thus far only identified in Greece as far north as Thessaly.71 IV. CONCLUSIONS This essay offers select and stratified examples of representative wares spanning all phases of the Bronze Age at Torone. It is hoped that the presence of significant phases and wares of the Bronze Age will be incorporated into studies of related material and neighbouring areas for a fuller prehistory of northern Greece, and a wider understanding of the Bronze Age Aegean during the third and second millennia bc. In particular, recognition of settlements that served as gateway communities to inland resources serving offshore explorers, initially in the Final Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, later during the expansion of the early Mycenaean age, is critical for tracing wider island and maritime networks. Like Cythera, which attracted the first Minoan settlement outside Crete in the Early Bronze Age, perhaps for the sake of minerals in Laconia, then supported a palatial-period settlement when Laconian marble became a chief target, Torone played multiple roles in long-distance contact and exchange over the longue duree of Aegean history and protohistory.72 71 V.
