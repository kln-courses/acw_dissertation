Based on a few studies dealing with the position of women in Jewish communities, the present paper suggests a typology of the attempts to change traditional male-centered Judaism. Three types of responses to traditional male-centered Judaism are pre- sented: the traditional, the modern, and the postmodern. This paper fo- cuses mainly on the two latter types. The case of the Reconstructionist movement is extensively discussed, not only to demonstrate the mod- ernist and postmodernist responses, but also to present and analyze the unique position of the Reconstructionists in gender-related issues. Traditional response refers here to religious practice that is legit- imized by continuity with the past. Change or innovation is justified in terms of its replication of past practices. The past is not perceived as a discrete phenomenon separate from the present and the future. Reflex- ivity is thus limited, since members of traditional societies have no con- ception of the tradition as something apart from themselves.' Sered's study about the ways in which Middle Eastern women in Jerusalem mod- ify elements of the male model of Judaism is an example of this tradi- tional form of innovation.2 Sered argues that, within the context of male-oriented religion, women clearly find ways to construct a meaning- ful religious life. The most effective way available to women, according to Sered, is to use the forms of the great tradition to sacralize their own female life experiences. Women domesticate religion. They interpret a ritual, place, or event in a way that is meaningful for them. The new in- terpretation often deals with the lives, sufferings, and deaths of close in- dividuals. An example of domestication is the use of a traditional forum, such as the reading of the Torah in the synagogue, to make personal re- quests of God on behalf of women's families. A complementary way used by women is to redefine female as normative. Women have developed an alternative scale of measuring value and worth. A good women cares Modern Judaism 16 (1996): 47-65 ? 1996 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">Nurit Zaidman for family and neighbors, prepares traditional kosher foods, donates to charity, and tends the tombs of kin and saints. According to Sered, the Middle Eastern women in Jerusalem reinterpret aspects of mainstream Judaism that are either hurtful to someone's self-image or irrelevant to women's life experiences.3 The second form of feminist attempts to change elements in Ju- daism is what can be described as the modern response. Modern reli- gion refers to the consciousness transformation that involves facing conditions in the present in light of the ideology of modern Western thought. Orientation toward the future implies far more reflexivity than was the case in traditional society. Reliance on the past is understood as confining, but only in extreme cases does this take the form of a desire to totally abandon the religious tradition. Those parts of tradition that can be accommodated to the new circumstances or justified in the light of present knowledge and expected trends are retained in a partial or modified form.4 Most of the American Reform, Conservative, and Re- constructionist congregations can thus be defined as "modern." Congre- gations differ in the way Jewish law and tradition are interpreted and practiced and in the degree that modern thought about women's equal- ity is embedded in everyday practice. Prell provides an account of a community of American Jews in the early 1970s that sought simultane- ously to be traditional and generally observant of the Jewish legal code but also to change the practices that make religious gender-equality im- possible. The community "produced a generic Jew, male or female, whose religious participation no longer depended on gender."5 In this community, women had responsibilities that were similar to those of men, although their actual participation was not as extensive as that of some of the most active male members. The innovations of the Minyan members rested less on the transformation of texts or rituals per se than on the reformulation of gender relations.6 A description of a new ritual which was created by a few feminists of the Minyan will be presented and discussed later on. The third category of attempts made byJewish feminists to change Judaism can be defined as postmodern. Postmodern religion makes no attempt to justify itself in terms of either the past or the future, nor does it make an attempt to create a coherent system of meaning and knowl- edge. Rather, it brings together, in a consciously eclectic fashion, sym- bols, beliefs, and practices from diverse sources, disembedding them from their original contexts of time and place.7 American postmodern feminists are inspired by both the Great and Little Jewish tradition, as well as by non-Jewish, non-Western practices. These (non-Jewish) prac- tices are often incorporated intoJewish themes, ideas, and practices. This paper opens with the introduction of the modern response to male-centeredJudaism based on the case of the Reconstructionist move- 48</page><page sequence="3">Variations of Jewish Feminism ment. The second section focuses on the postmodern response to male- centeredJudaism and a criticism of this approach. This section includes a description of a postmodern ritual-burying an infant's placenta. The third section focuses on feminism in Reconstructionist congregations. The data for this section is taken from a questionnaire that was sent to all Reconstructionist congregations. The paper ends with a discussion of the three forms of responses to male-centeredJudaism. The data for this paper includes interviews with people involved in the process of the Reconstructionist movement's policy-making and with those who are actually creating newJewish practices; analysis of res- olutions and documents issued by the leading bodies of the Reconstruc- tionist movement; analysis of materials created by initiators in the Reconstructionist Rabbinic Seminar and in the movement's congrega- tions; observations of rituals and activities that took place in the move- ment's Rabbinic Seminar and in a Reconstructionist congregation; and results of a questionnaire that was sent to rabbis and active members of all sixty-five congregations of the movement. (All together there were forty-two responses, which represented 65 percent of the total number of Reconstructionist congregations and havurot). The above data was gathered during the two years (1991-1992) when the author was an in- structor in the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College (RRC) in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, and during a year (1993) when the author was a teacher in a Hebrew school in a Reconstructionist congregation in the Philadel- phia area, and during the year 1994. THE MODERN RESPONSE: EQUAIL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN IN SYNAGOGUE PARTICIPATION AND RITUAI OBSERVANCE As we suggested before, modern religions consciously select their beliefs and practices to suit conditions in the present. The Reform, Conserva- tive, and Reconstructionist movements in North America can thus be called modernist. The position of women in the non-Orthodox North American Jewish communities has been influenced by the general rise in interest in women's rights in the United States. Modern Jewish femin- ism began in early 1971 with a small group of women calling themselves "Ezrat Nashim" [lit. women's section (in the traditional synagogue)]. The group appeared at the convention of the Conservative movement demanding the full participation of women in Jewish life. Later they func- tioned as a consciousness-raising group along with other consciousness- raising groups that were more politically oriented.8 Modern thought about liberalism and equality motivated the feminist movement in the United States and influenced the non-Orthodox Jewish denominations. Data taken from 470 American congregations in 1978 indicate that 49</page><page sequence="4">Nurit Zaidman mixed seating and women leading the congregation in English readings were almost universal among Reform and Conservative congregations. Almost all Reform congregations counted women toward a minyan [quo- rum], allowed them to chant the service, honored them with aliyot [lit. the going up] to the Torah and let them lead ceremonies. About half of the Conservative congregations counted women toward a minyan and honored women with aliyot to the Torah.9 Since 1983, the Conservative rabbinical school has admitted women as rabbinical candidates.10 Women began to apply to the Reform rabbinical college (HUC) in the mid- 1960s and they have been admitted to the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College (RRC) since it first opened in 1968." The Reconstructionist movement has always been in the forefront of modern reforms in Judaism. It is the most reflexive of the modernist Jewish movements in respect to women. Changes in the position of women in synagogue participation and ritual observance have taken place in the non-Orthodox American Jewish denominations since the 1960s. Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of the Reconstructionist move- ment, was a pioneer in this field. He had published his ideas about equal rights for women in 1936. Kaplan wrote: "Whatever the woman's lot may have been in pastJewish life, traditional Jewish law undoubtedly treated her as a lower type of human being than man," and, "many tal- ented Jewish women not only began to lose interest in Jewish life, but ac- tually turned against it... If we do not want our talented women to follow their example, we must find in Judaism a place for their powers. This cannot come about, unless all taint of inferiority will be removed from the status of the Jewish woman."12 In 1964, Kaplan founded the So- ciety for the Advancement of Judaism (SAJ), in which women could be counted in the minyan and receive an aliyah to the Torah. Likewise, the first Sabbath morning Bat Mitzvah ceremony in the United States was that of Kaplan's own daughter. Other changes in the woman's position (e.g., a woman serving as a witness, leading services, publicly reading from the Torah) "did not take place in ReconstructionistJudaism until the 1970s when, as Kaplan predicted, women themselves demanded the changes."'3 Kaplan's pioneering position in gender-related issues, as well as the later Reconstructionist resolutions about an egalitarian commu- nity (see the following section) can be explained in light of the Re- constructionist ideology. As opposed to the other non-Orthodox North-American Jewish denominations, Reconstructionists are not only influenced by modern Western thought, but call for embracing and in- corporating two civilizations: Judaism and the modern Western civiliza- tion. This principle is expressed even at the very popular level of an explanatory brochure. The Reconstructionist brochure "Who Is a Re- constructionistJew?" says: "Jews who now find themselves in democratic societies live primarily in a secular civilization..., and [are] structur- 50</page><page sequence="5">Variations of Jewish Feminism ing their lives according to accepted Western values. Reconstructionists call upon Jews to embrace this open, democratic society-not only be- cause its structural pluralism does not require the abandonment of Ju- daism, but also because American ideals at their best coincide with Jewish ideals as they ought to be developed and reconstructed."'4 For that reason, namely that Reconstructionism emphasizes that the Ameri- can culture be incorporated into Jewish culture, it has been argued that Reconstructionist ideology reflects the American experience more than any otherJewish religious group.'1 Recent Reconstructionist resolutions about the position of gays and lesbians show that the present leadership of the movement, like Kaplan himself, is still at the forefront of modern reforms in Judaism. American Reconstructionists pushed the feminist agenda further by seeking "equality for other disenfranchised groups-the poor, gays and les- bians, Jewishly identified non-Jews, the disabled."'6 Reconstructionist resolutions about patrilineal descent and about gays and lesbians demonstrate how the feminist agenda is expanded to include not only women, but other groups. The resolution of the Federation of Recon- structionist Congregations and Havurot (FRCH) regarding children of mixed marriages (1968) says that children of aJewish father and a non- Jewish mother will be considered Jews by the Reconstructionist move- ment if "the parents have committed themselves to rear their children as Jews .. "17 A similar resolution was taken fifteen years later, in March 1983, by the (Reform) Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR). The CCAR decided to equate patrilineal and matrilineal descent. Resolutions concerning homosexuals is another aspect of the Re- constructionist concern for egalitarianism. In 1992, the FRCH, along with the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association (RRA), published a report on the Reconstructionist position on homosexuality and Judaism. The report represents the "unequivocal stance on this issue," yet, according to the principle of autonomy in the Reconstructionist movement, the policy recommended in the document is perceived only as a "guideline." Congregations that are affiliated with the movement may adopt a differ- ent policy if they wish. The report affirms previous resolutions, such as the 1984 admission policy of the RRC, that "age, sex, marital status, sex- ual orientation and race will not be determining factors in the consider- ation of the Admission Committee,"'8 and the 1990 resolution of the RRA calling for a movement-wide policy of non-discrimination in rab- binic placement.19 In addition to the above, the report recommended the adoption of the following policies and guidelines: to welcome gay and lesbian individuals and families as members of congregations and movement organizations with full rights and responsibilities; to accord full rights, rites, and responsibilities to gay and lesbian individuals; to develop ceremonies for gays and lesbians that affirm publicly their com- 51</page><page sequence="6">Nurit Zaidman mitment to one another or the termination of their relationships; and to reach out to gay and lesbian Jews and implement programs toward that end.2" Reconstructionist resolutions about women's position and equality reflect an attempt to incorporate modern thought into Jewish congrega- tional life. This attitude, which we have defined as the modern re- sponse, is also expressed in the type of resources Reconstructionists use. In general, Reconstructionists turn to modern Western resources, Jew- ish resources, and, to some degree, to modern Israeli resources-to tra- ditional Jewish texts as well as to Western sources, even when they are contradictory. Thus, for example, the FRCH and RRA report on the Re- constructionist position on homosexuality and Judaism includes a sur- vey of biblical, rabbinic, and medieval sources, as well as a survey of contemporary scientific and contemporary Jewish sources on the topic.21 Modern feminists have not only changed the formal position of women in the synagogue but also the structure and content of Jewish ritual. An example of a new modern feminist ritual provided by Prell- Foldes demonstrates the type of change. A Sabbath service was per- formed by a few women who were members of an egalitarian American Jewish community in the early 1970s. In general, the women maintained most of the liturgy and structure of a regular service.22 They conveyed, however, two major messages to the audience. One is that women, like men, can plan and conductJewish ritual. By actually planning and per- forming the ritual in public, the women made the message more power- ful, but the message was also an essential part of the structure and the content of the ritual itself. Two additional structured discussions of the service were led by the women planners. One was held as a substitution for a regular Torah discussion, and the other was held after the conclu- sion of the service. The feminist demand that women should be equal to men in all aspects of congregational life was overtly expressed by a woman who brought the scroll into the room. She read: "... The Torah is the central symbol of Judaism, but I've hardly read from her. The Torah is the center symbol ofJudaism, but I've hardly held her."23 Like other modern feminists, the women organizers expressed con- cern about "God-language" as well. The first part of the Sabbath morn- ing service, the reciting of psalms, was conducted without much change. However, it included the poetry of a modern Hebrew poet and a Yid- dish tkhine [a private petitional prayer written for and frequently by women]. The second part of the morning service was an alternative ami- dah [the central standing prayer] in which the women included new im- ages of God such as: "yours are the cradling arms of life" and, "the womb of our safe deliverance." These images replaced the traditional male images of God. As we can see from the above, much of the efforts of the modern 52</page><page sequence="7">Variations of Jewish Feminism (and postmodern) feminists to change elements in Judaism have to do with God-language. In order to avoid masculine God-language and the- ology, feminists have suggested two alternatives. In one, God is pre- sented as the power that sustains and moves the world. In the other, God is portrayed anthropomorphically as She, the Goddess. Recon- structionists' innovations in this area, as we shall see later on, demon- strate both alternatives. God is presented in some feminist discussion, liturgy, and writing as the power that sustains and moves the world. This non-anthropomorphic image of God is not much different from Kaplan's understanding of God and is common among Reconstruction- ists. In classical Reconstructionist thought, God has no theological at- tributes. Kaplan believed that God is "an expression of the belief that what ought to be is in keeping with the very nature of things," and that "what ought to be will ultimately be realized. God may therefore be de- fined as the Power that endorses what we believe ought to be, and that guarantees that it will be."24 God is, then, the creative power or energy in people (and in nature). For that reason, and because of the Recon- structionist search for equality, mainstream Reconstructionists support feminist claims to create gender-neutral language and new, non- anthropomorphic images of God. The new Reconstructionist prayer book features gender-neutral language in the English portion, while the Hebrew text remains unchanged. The following is an example taken from the Birkat Hamazon [grace after meals] in the Reconstructionist prayer book Kol Haneshamah. In this part of the blessing, the Hebrew source is copied without any changes. The English translation of the name of God YEHOVA (which is a combination of four Hebrew letters) has been translated to Yah, The Source, The Radiance, The Living One, The Mighty One, The Righteous One.26 Falk's alternative blessings are common among Reconstructionists. Her rendering of the traditional words "Who brings forth bread from the earth" [hamotzi lehem min ha'aretz] as "Let us bless the source of life that brings forth bread from the earth" [Nevarekh et ein hahayyim hamotzi'ah lehem min ha'aretz] ,27 is an example of her attempts to "dislodge the anthropocentrism of tradi- tionalJewish language by drawing metaphors for God from the whole of creation [which] is very much part of a wider feminist inclination to turn to nature as a source of religious imagery and to insist on the value of the nonhuman world."28 The feminism which has developed in North American Jewish lib- eral circles since the 1960s has presented women's issues as the concern of the entire community. This type of modern feminism is reflexive, ide- ological, and political: women reflected upon their position in the com- munity; developed ideology which was expressed in their practices and in God-language; and fought for equality inside and outside the Jewish community. 53</page><page sequence="8">Nurit Zaidman THE POSTMODERN RESPONSE: WOMEN'S RELIGION IN THE RECONSTRUCTIONIST MOVEMENT Postmodern feminism, like other postmodern religions, brings together symbols, beliefs, and practices from diverse sources. At present, there are only a few centers of Jewish feminists that can be called postmodern. By centers we mean informal gatherings of small groups of women. Post- modern feminism is a private, domestic phenomenon with very little in- stitutional expression. The Reconstructionist movement, again, has been in the forefront of postmodern Jewish feminism. Since the early 1980s, the Reconstruc- tionist Rabbinical College has been a center for revolutionary feminists who have gravitated to the movement because "it is so open to question- ing everything and being skeptical about everything... It is a place for women to do this kind of exploration."29 Most of the activities of postmodern feminists take place outside of the public arena. They are not political, although in some context they do have a political message. One way of expressing their feminism is to create new rituals that focus on women's experience. Below we describe a ritual witnessed by the author that was performed by a group of women and men who are associated with the community of the RRC. The focus of the ritual is the burying of the placenta, foreskin, and um- bilical cord of David, a three-week old infant. Burying David's Placenta-A Description of a Ritual At 8:00 p.m., people started to gather in the backyard of the Klein fam- ily. The house is located in Mount Airy, a neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and a center for Reconstructionism. The guests sat at the table that still had leftovers of a dinner of pizza. There were eleven adults: David's parents, David's midwife (a man), and friends. David's older brother (four years old) was wearing only a T-shirt. Yael, the ritual specialist, who is a fourth-year student at the RRC, wore shorts, a T-shirt with a print of what looked like a Greek Goddess, and earrings in the shape of the moon and the stars. The rest of the participants wore casual clothing. The ritual specialist brought a tablecloth which was laid on the porch floor. She later explained to me that the tablecloth was set like an altar. Yael cleaned up the table and brought cold tea and cake. Then she placed on the tablecloth: a decorated glass of water on which was writ- ten: nevarech et ain hahaim [let us bless the source of life]; a bunch of weeds; two small candles; a pot with sand; and a plastic jar which con- tained the placenta, part of David's umbilical cord, and his dried fore- 54</page><page sequence="9">Variations of Jewish Feminism skin. I was later informed that the first four objects symbolized the four elements: water, air, fire, and earth; and that these elements, which are traditionally used in witchcraft, were also used in the old Temple in Jerusalem. The participants gathered around the tablecloth, most of them sitting on the floor. After a short period of time, Yael opened the ceremony. The ritual began with songs and melodies to verses from the tradi- tional Jewish evening prayers. Later on, when I talked to Yael about the ritual, she defined these songs as "gathering songs"; i.e., songs that bring people together. Several kinds of drums were used when the par- ticipants chanted verses from the prayer and during the ritual. Follow- ing the songs, Yael invited Miriam and Sarah, two Biblical women, to be present in the ceremony. Yael later explained to me that Miriam was in- vited since she is the woman Goddess for water (Miriam stood on the bank of the river) and Sarah is the Goddess for fire (Sarah lit the candle in the tent every week). Calling for these women to be present is still part of the act of casting a circle, or creating a sacred space. Following that, David's mother lit the weeds and gave them to David's brother to hold, who in turn passed them near the heads of the participants. Then David's mother lit the candles. During the introduction of the four elements, Yael and David's mother sang their own songs. The main theme of the songs was trees. Then Yael and David's mother blessed the participants so that they would be "clear and strong." Yael read quotations from the Midrash related to the foreskin and its burial. She explained the rationale of the ceremony as follows: "It is al- most a given in liberal Jewish circles today that a baby girl will be named during her own covenant ceremony. These ceremonies have arisen to parallel the brit, thereby giving the baby woman her due entrance into the Jewish community. But what of the brit ceremony itself? Has it in any way been changed or modified to reflect contemporary feminist values? In what ways are women becoming part of the brit ceremony, in what way have women claimed their role in the covenanting of their sons?... I asked several women how they enhanced their son's brit in order to per- sonalize it for them. How did they feminize it, what did they con- tribute?... The second idea was sparked by the Sephardi women who buried the foreskin. The foreskin and the placenta, although once part of the human body, are extraneous in Jewish tradition. Although we are buried with our hair and fingernails in order to remain whole, we are not buried with our foreskins and placenta. In fact it is by discarding these items that we are made holy and whole. We also have in Jewish tradition a practice of planting a tree for a baby ... In these days of en- vironmental awareness, it is certainly appropriate to plant a tree to sym- 55</page><page sequence="10">Nurit Zaidman bolize and to ensure that the earth will flourish for the next generation. Reclaiming our body parts for sacred burial, the foreskin and the pla- centa-representing the male and the female components needed for creating life-is more appropriate to me than leaving them to some hospital administrator or trashman to add to the heap of rampant garbage." Then David's mother spoke about herself and asked the par- ticipants to say "where they are in their lives," or to bless the baby. She was the first person to talk. Following her, one woman told us about the tree that was in their backyard and how her sister used to play on it. An- other woman blessed the child, saying she hoped that he would have roots in the ground and leaves in the air. Between these monologues, Yael led the group with songs that were relevant to the topic. Then all the participants left the porch and went to the garden. David's father and other participants dug a hole in the ground into which David's um- bilical cord, foreskin, and placenta were placed. A friend took a picture of the father and the mother as they dug the hole. Then David's mother told us about the tree that they planted when their older child was born and about their plans to plant another tree for David. The participants blessed David's mother, had some tea and cake, and went home. Yael and her friends conduct other rituals like the one described above. Among them: a ritual when a baby is three months old; when a woman is having her first period after giving birth; and a healing ritual for women who have experienced crises. The structure of the ritual de- scribed above is similar to the structure of other rituals that Yael and her friends conduct. They open with acts that connect the people to "the center," followed by blessings, sharing (talking), gift giving, teaching, reading, and the participation of the people who are present. The inspiration for, and to some degree the format of, postmodern rituals is taken from what is known as "women's religion" or "witchcraft." Starhawk, a well-known figure among postmodern Reconstructionist feminists, wrote about this religion and suggested some of its practices. Starhawk explains: "The mysteries of the absolute can never be ex- plained-only felt or intuited. Symbols and ritual acts are used to trig- ger altered states of awareness, in which insights that go beyond words are revealed ... The primary symbol for "That-Which-Cannot-Be-Told" is the Goddess. The Goddess has infinite aspects and thousands of names-She is the reality behind many metaphors. She is reality, the manifest deity, omnipresent in all of life, in each of us. The Goddess is not separate from the world-She is the world, and all things in it: moon, sun, earth, star, stone, seed, flowing river, wind, wave, leaf and branch, bud and blossom, fang and claw, woman and man."30 In her book The Spiral Dance, Starhawk suggests exercises, invocations, chants, blessings, spells, and herbal charms.31 56</page><page sequence="11">Variations of Jewish Feminism These and other practices are adopted by postmodern feminists. The women to whom I spoke explained that they turn to Starhawk be- cause her suggestions "work." I was told that casting a circle, for exam- ple, creates an energy which cannot be achieved otherwise. Postmodern feminists do not substitute one religion for another, at least not from their point of view; rather, they are engaged in exploring feminine spiri- tuality. The exploration of women's spirituality is not restricted to one source or to one culture. Different texts and practices are used, al- though Starhawk's work is quite dominant. Yael, the ritual specialist in the ceremony described above, turns to Jewish resources and practices which are part of the GreatJewish tradi- tion. An example of a scholarly work which she uses is Midrash Pirke de Rabbi Eliezar. Yael also uses popular Jewish resources (e.g., Ginzberg, Legends of theJews) and oral accounts of women. She adopts the practice of Sephardi women of burying the foreskin.32 The Native American reli- gion is another source. Some of her practices are actually taken from Starhawk's work. She casts a circle and introduces the four elements, among them the Native American smudge stick. She also uses a non- Jewish practice in a Jewish context, calling for the spirits (a non-Jewish practice) of Jewish personalities (Sarah and Miriam). Finally, Yael com- bines the Jewish tradition of planting a tree for a baby with environmen- tal awareness. Along with the creation of new rituals, postmodern feminists have made changes in God-language. They substitute the image of the mascu- line God with the image of a feminine God, the Goddess. Plaskow ex- plains: "Drawing on widespread traditions of Goddess worship but also freely modifying them, feminist followers of the Goddess find in her both a rich and life-affirming alternative to the (upstart) male God and the point of intersection for all the themes of new naming feminist spir- ituality involves ... She is Asherah, Ishtar, Isis, Afrekete, Oyo, Ezuli, Mary, and Shekhinah."33 The worship of the Goddess is not common among postmodern Reconstructionists nor is the image of the Goddess as described by Plaskow. The Jewish Women Studies Project's files in the RRC, which include most of the material women in the Reconstruction- ist movement use (such as bibliographies about women's issues, pa- pers by students, and plans for creative rituals) do not include material about the Goddess. (The only exception was a feminist Hagada [the Passover prayer book] which had an illustration of Isis on its cover). However, expressions such as Shekhina [lit. God's "presence"] and Malkat Ha-Olam [lit. queen of the universe] are popular among some feminists in the Reconstructionist movement. The following are two examples of songs which include images of the feminine that are used in feminists rituals: 57</page><page sequence="12">Nurit Zaidman Malkat Ha-Olam by Hanna Tiferet Siegel in Jewish Wommyn's SongBook by Geela Rayzel [The first and the last stanza as well as the chorus of a six-stanza poem].

These issues became a public debate in 1986 when the 4 December 1986 issue of the Jewish Advocate in Boston came out with an interview with Jane Litman, then a fourth-year rabbini- cal student at the RRC, who is quoted as saying that she has been ac- cused of idolatry for making statues of Asherah, a Canaanite goddess, as part of an effort to "dig up women's spiritual practices from the past and see what resonates." Rosenblatt, a journalist with the Advocate, reported that negative feedback from the original article led to a full-scale inquiry by the faculty of the RRC. The faculty stated unequivocally that it be- lieved the invocation of pagan deities, male or female, to be outside the bounds ofJudaism, as it has always been. It similarly considered the use of plastic or pictorial imagery in a devotional context to be regressive rather than progressive in the development ofJudaism and saw no place for it within Reconstructionism.34 In the 24 April 1987 issue of the Balti- moreJewish Times (p. 7) Jane Litman published her response: "It is im- portant that Liberal Judaism integrate women not only into its organization structure as rabbis, cantors and lay leaders, but that it also 58</page><page sequence="13">Variations of Jewish Feminism accept women's vision and experience into its historiography and theol- ogy ... In terms of theology, it means that women's images of the Deity must be given the same credence as men's ... When such masculine im- agery for God as "King," "Lord of Hosts," and "Man of War," is consid- ered normative, but the introduction of the ancient Hebrew feminine terms for the Deity such as "Queen of Heaven" or "Mother of all living things," is met with charges of "Canaanite idol making" or "statue wor- ship," there is a problem."35 Arthur Green, the president of the RRC at that time, and a well- known scholar, considered the above images as illegitimate. He pub- lished a polemical article in which he argued that the proper point of origin for trulyJewish spirituality is the "symbols of the sacred feminine given us by our tradition."36 Green suggests terms such as Shekhinah and alternating blessings between barukh ha-elohim [Blessed is God] and berukhah ha-elohut [Blessed is divinity]. Such references to God as Malkat Ha-'olam [queen of the universe] or the parody-like quality of immenu malkatenu [our Mother, our Queen] "may in fact backfire in their pur- pose, he argues.37 "Above all," Green continued, "let Jewish feminism clearly proclaim itself as spiritually and linguistically Jewish, cutting it- self off clearly from any attempt at new-paganism or the revival of witch- craft, however wrapped it may be in quasi-Jewish garb."38 In spite of these objections, the newly ordained women rabbis chose to cast a circle as part of their graduation ceremony in June 1993. The graduation ceremony is one of the central events of the movement to which very important people are invited. This act elicited a negative re- sponse from the RRC leadership. FEMINIST THEOIOGY AND RITUAI, IN RECONSTRUCTIONIST CONGREGATIONS In the previous sections, we have drawn a profile of modern and post- modern feminism. The activities of leaders (whether Reconstructionist or active feminists) were overrepresented. To what degree feminist activ- ities have been absorbed in the non-Orthodox American Jewish com- munities is an important question which is beyond the scope of this paper. We can provide, however, some information about the impact of feminist consciousness on Reconstructionist congregations. Responses from active members and rabbis of Reconstructionist congregations to my questionnaire (previously mentioned) affirmed that in their congregations women take leadership roles, are called to the Torah, lead services, can serve as witnesses in religious courts, etc. However, according to a public relations person at the RRC, and based on the lists of names of rabbis in congregations given out by the move- ment itself, no more than 15 percent of the congregations have a rabbi 59</page><page sequence="14">Nurit Zaidman who is a woman. One should note that women have been accepted and ordained at the RRC since the day the school was opened and that, in general, the number of graduate female rabbis is about equal to the number of male graduates. Thus, one might ask why female rabbis do not hold high positions in Reconstructionist congregations as fre- quently as male rabbis do. There are two possible explanations: first, women often are not interested in a full-time position as a rabbi in a big congregation. They prefer instead to have a part-time position as, for ex- ample, Hillel directors or Hebrew school principals. Second, informal accounts of students and faculty at the RRC indicate that Reconstruc- tionist congregations prefer male rabbis. In that respect, one should raise the question, how different are Reconstructionist congregations from other Jewish denominations, in which women rabbis work mostly in small congregations that are low in prestige and pay?39 The influence of postmodern feminism is not as strongly felt in Re- constructionist congregations as might first appear. My data cover two main areas: the kind of rituals that are performed for girls and women in Reconstructionist congregations, and the type of God-language that they use. A welcoming ceremony for baby girls has been established in most of the congregations in the movement. In only five congregations responding to the questionnaire had welcoming rituals for baby girls not been performed; and of these five, one was ofJewish male prisoners and another is a Havurah of elderly people. About ten respondents noted that these ceremonies were performed in their congregations as often as the brit for boys. One person said that the ceremony was per- formed for every girl in their congregation, as well as for a few girls out- side of the congregation. The inspiration for many such rituals has been Jewish sources. Thus, for example, in one Reconstructionist congregation, parents chose to adopt Abraham's act of welcoming guests as the symbolic basis for a welcoming ritual for a baby girl. Instead of the physical cleansing of the legs which Abraham performed, the parents rinsed the baby girl's legs with water which, according to the parents, symbolized a physical and spiritual welcoming.4" While relatively new rituals for girls have been established in Recon- structionist congregations, new rituals for adult women are performed in only a few congregations. Based on the information that we have from forty-two congregations, weaning ceremonies or change of life (menopause) ceremonies were never performed in the synagogue. However, women's rituals are performed monthly in Rosh Chodesh [new month] meetings of the Reconstructionist congregations. The partici- pants in these meetings are usually women only. Rosh Chodesh meetings take place in 40 percent of the Reconstructionist congregations that re- sponded to the questionnaire, with 65 percent of these having a meet- 60</page><page sequence="15">Variations of Jewish Feminism ing every month, and 35 percent once in several months. Rosh Chodesh meetings usually include a discussion about the theme of the month and, often, healing rituals or other rituals related to women's experi- ence as well. The language of prayer is another topic which feminists fought for. Information taken from the questionnaire shows that most Reconstruc- tionist congregations do not change the traditional Hebrew words when they pray. However, they do change the meaning of prayers significantly by applying gender-neutral language in English. To the question: what form of God-language is used when praying in your synagogue? Thirty- six answered that they used Baruch Ata; seven used Berucha At; five used Nevarech; thirty-five avoided using the word Lord when referring to God; thirty avoided using masculine pronouns when referring to God. The questionnaire confirmed that, in general, Reconstructionists pray in tra- ditional Hebrew and in gender-neutral language in English, and that the alternative blessings, in which female language is used for God (e.g., Berucha At), or the blessing in which God is not approached directly (e.g., Nevarech) are less common. From the data presented above, one can conclude that most Recon- structionist congregations accept the movement formula as it appears in their new prayer book. In this prayer book, the (male-centered) Hebrew language does not change, but the English part is written in gender- neutral language. CONCLUSIONS We introduced three approaches to male-centered Judaism in this paper: the traditional, the modern, and the postmodern. The focus of both, the traditional response as practiced by the Middle Eastern women in Jerusalem and the postmodern response as practiced by some Reconstructionist feminists is the private, domestic aspect of women's life. The Middle Eastern women domesticate Judaism to make it rele- vant to their life experiences.4' Women's experiences have been a major focus for Reconstructionist feminists as well. Women's rituals deal with events related to the female body, to reproduction, and to domestic life. Reconstructionist feminists who perform these rituals are not different from other religious feminists who "challenge values that separate the private and the public sphere and that give more weight to what hap- pens in public over against the private." Alpert further argues that "fem- inists challenge religions to put what were once called women's issues-children, sexuality, reproduction, relationships, domestic life- on their agenda, giving them value equal to the issues of prayer, study, and good deeds."42 61</page><page sequence="16">Nurit Zaidman It is obvious, however, that there are quite a few differences between the two forms of domestication. A major difference is shown when one examines the center of the ritual act. The nuclear and the extended family, as well as the family of Israel, are the focus of many of the do- mestic practices of the traditional Middle Eastern women in Jerusalem. These women are making requests of God on behalf of their nuclear and extended families and are highly involved in helping other mem- bers of the community. As opposed to them, the center of most of the religious practices of the postmodern Reconstructionist feminists is the individual woman. Close friends, usually women, participate and con- tribute to these individual-based activities, but the function of these rit- uals is mainly therapeutic, and they are directed toward helping the woman in the center. Other major differences are related to the sources and the general context of these rituals, especially the relationship to Jewish religious law [halacha] and the GreatJewish tradition. The center of the modern feminist ritual is not the private, domes- tic aspect of a woman's life, but rather the public-political face of being an equal member in aJewish community. Prell-Folds describes the Sab- bath service that the feminists performed in their Minyan and con- cludes: "Within the ritual, women had presented themselves asJews and women, and neither part of that identity was subordinate."43 Finally, within twenty years, many feminist attitudes, those which we have defined as modern, have been absorbed and domesticated in the public lives of mainstream American Jewry.44 A few "liberated" Jewish feminists have continued to create a new form of (postmodern) femi- nism which has been influenced by general trends in the American soci- ety, such as the ideas and practices of the "New Age."45 Postmodern feminism in the Reconstructionist movement is influenced by general trends in the movement itself. Liebman cites Steinberg, who argued that "the most serious deficiency in Kaplan's theology is that, [it is] lack- ing a metaphysics."46 This attitude is expressed in the words of Staub, a present leader in the movement: "for many individuals, once again, the only way back into the Jewish liturgical cycle is through experimenta- tion-by including new prayers or revising old ones, through song and dance and chanting and body movement, by expanding our images of God to include the feminine as well as the masculine, the personal and political as well as the majestic and awesome."47 Postmodern feminism is considered to be as radical as was modern feminism twenty-five years ago. The question remains: twenty years from now, is postmodern feminism going to be part of the life of the non- Orthodox Jewish denominations, or is it going to remain a phenome- non on the periphery? 62</page><page sequence="17">Variations of Jewish Feminism NOTES Acknowledgements.
