<plain_text><page sequence="1">Condor 83:380 @ The Cooper Ornithological Society 1981 RECENT PUBLICATIONS Chimney Swifts and Their Relatives.--Margaret Whittemore. 1981. Nature Books Publishers. 169 p. Paper cover. $5.95, plus 590 postage. Source: Nature Books Publishers, P.O. Box 12157, Jackson, MS 39211. This is a book about the habits of swifts, aimed for those who share the author's love for these birds. It concentrates on the Chimney Swift and devotes less attention to other members of the family-most of whom are poorly-known. Information has been culled from the literature, the author's observations, and her correspondence with other students of swifts. The writing is chatty and in places anthropomorphic. Pho- tographs, sketches, references. The Mystery of Migration.-Chief Contributing Ed- itor, Robin Baker. 1981. Viking Press, New York. 256 p. $29.95. This book for general readers offers the broadest possible survey of migration, having rede- fined the phenomenon to include all living things. It proposes "that all animals migrate from choice and with judgement and not only by instinct; that plants, too, are migrants, moving either as spores or seeds or as whole plants; that man ... is a migrant; and that exploration, nomadism, emigration, and immigration are as much a part of migration as the classical seasonal to-and-from movements." Chapters are each devoted to different groups of organisms. While the text is com- prehensive, informative, and easily readable, at least that on birds is not well balanced or fully up-to-date. The contributions of Baker and his four fellow-editors, all British behaviorists, are not identified. The book is profusely illustrated with maps, drawings, diagrams, and photographs. Regrettably, it lacks references and credits for the original sources of the illustrations; hence, a reader has no way of knowing the basis for the statements or of following up topics of interest. The Connecticut Warbler.-This is a new "quarterly publication devoted to the promotion of bird study and conservation in the state of Connecticut." Started in 1981, it is the State's first field journal of ornithology. It is edited by Roland C. Clement and published by the Natural History Services Department of the Con- necticut Audubon Society. Subscriptions ($6.00) and material to be considered for publication (articles, notes, monochrome photographs, drawings) should be submitted to the journal office, C.A.S., 314 Unquowa Road, Fairfield, CT 06430. Aves de Costa Rica.-Alexander F. Skutch. 1980. Ed- itorial Costa Rica, San Jose, Costa Rica. 148 p. Paper cover. 30 colones. This is an introductory book about the birds of Costa Rica, written in Spanish and ad- dressed to the people of that country. It presents one hundred species, describing on one page for each, their appearance, voice, habitat, habits, nesting, and range. The accounts are non-technical yet authoritative. They are illustrated with color and monochrome photo- graphs by John S. Dunning. Like Thurber's Cien Aves de El Salvador (noted in Condor 81:156) this book should promote indigenous interest in birds and their protection.</page></plain_text>
