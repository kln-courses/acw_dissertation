<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTICES OF BOOKS. Euripides, der Dichter der griechischen Aufklrung. Von WILHELM NESTLE. Pp. xiv + 595. Stuttgart : Kohlhammer, 1901. Though published three years ago, this book has been only recently sent for review. It is an elaborate study of the mind of Euripides, not as poet or dramatist, but as thinker, as the leader of Greek thought away from the conventional anthropomorphic cult into wider and fresher fields of religion and ethics. The discussion of Euripides' theology is not particularly new or illuminating. It is summed up in the phrases, 'Euripides wholly rejected the gods of Greek popular belief . .. he casts aside the entire anthropomorphism of the Greek Olympus, and primarily on the grounds of reason and morals. . . . For Euripides, the divine essence manifested itself as a cosmic moral power [AlK'] immanent in the universe and working according to eternal laws.' More novel, because less often dealt with on so extended a scale, is the discussion of his ' anthropology,' i.e. his psychology, ethics, and social and political philosophy, illustrated very copiously by translations from the dramas. Though there is plenty of literary feeling, literary form is painfully absent, and the volume, though not without interest, is heavy reading. It concludes with over 200 closely printed pages of notes and indices.</page></plain_text>
