<plain_text><page sequence="1">Erasing Historical Difference: The Alternative Orthodoxy in Canadian Theatre Alan Filewod The construct of an alternative theatre as the radical aesthetic and structural chal- lenge to an established "mainstream" informs the most common perception of mod- ern Canadian theatre history. It is inscribed in critical discourse, in the funding policies and assessment procedures of the federal and provincial arts councils, in the rhetoric of the theatres and, for most of its history, in the editorial analysis of the Canadian Theatre Review. By questioning the critical paradigm of alternative theatre I wish to suggest a need to reappraise the ideological forms by which the recent history of Canadian theatre has been constructed, and in the process of that argument, I want to reconsider the general usefulness of "alternative theatre" as a critical term. This inquiry begins with the idea that in the context of Canadian theatre at least, terms like "alternative" and "mainstream" obscure rather than clarify historical forces. These terms enabled critics to define an emerging movement a decade ago but they have outlived their function, and their continued use draws attention to their essentially metaphoric nature. Rather than constantly redefining such terms to align them with changing conditions, perhaps their fundamental validity should be questioned. My analysis is based on the English Canadian experience because the rhetorical formation of alternativeness was different in Quebec, where the term jeune thMdtre played a parallel identifying role. The material and structural principles may have been in most respects similar-bearing in mind that the jeune theatre comprised many more part-time troupes, and had the advantages of a more centralized culture and ideology-but the political determination of the theatre differed greatly between francophone (primarily but not exclusively Quebecois) and anglophone Canada.1 Alan Filewod is Assistant Professor of Drama at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and Editor of Canadian Theatre Review. He is the author of Collective Encounters: Documentary Theatre in English Canada and various articles on political theatre in Canada. 'By the mid-seventies there were approximately one hundred "alternate" theatre companies in English-speaking Canada, and roughly the same number of francophone troupes in Quebec. For two different perspectives on the parallels of the alternate theatre and the Quebec juene thidtre, see Alan Filewod, "The Ideological Formation of Political Theatre In Canada," Theatre History in Canada 8:2 (1987), and Renate Usmiani, Second Stage: The Alternative Theatre Movement in Canada (Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1983). 201</page><page sequence="2">202 / Lorraine Helms Critical orthodoxy of the alternative theatre in English Canada locates the period of the late 1960s to the mid 1970s as a point of historical crisis during which the mainstream regional theatre system was challenged and overshadowed by the emerg- ing alternates. The regionals are usually characterized by conservative repertoires, a mistrust of Canadian drama, middle-class audiences, and a marked tendency to prefer foreign, usually British, artistic directors. The alternates are the heroes in this cultural drama: nationalistic, committed to Canadian playwrights, young, radical, and self-consciously experimental.2 As convention has it, they began as expressions of the familiar American concept of radical theatre, and evolved a nationalist ideology: the weak faded away and the strong survived; they legitimized playwriting as a profession in this country; they spawned a generation of new actors, designers, and directors, and eventually they ate the mainstream. This version of history locates its climax in the merger in 1988 of the "alternate" Toronto Free Theatre with the "regional" CentreStage to form the Canadian Stage Company, now one of the three largest theatres in Canada; the alternates have transformed the conditions of their existence to become the new mainstream. During the struggle for cultural nationalism in the 1970s that reading of emerging history was necessary, and it may still be useful. Recently I've become dissatisfied with it, because there are too many unresolved questions and contradictions. I am uncomfortable with the implied analysis of what is termed "mainstream," a term that does not imply anything as marginal as the theatre in Canada today and simplifies the complex class allegiances that institutionalize the theatre in North America. This entire mainstream/alternative paradigm progresses with no explicit reference to class or audience. It constructs the audience not as an active presence but as an ahistorical mass that is acted upon, a target for subscription drives and publicity campaigns. The terms are employed with virtually no reference to the cultural formation of the theatre as an expression of community. Their pretension to dialectical coherence, and their bipolar axis mean that these terms do not admit analyses based on criteria other than their own premises. The most obvious exclusion is a consideration of the role of gender: when recent Canadian theatre history is analysed in terms of the politics of gender and sexuality (and it rarely is) the dialectic of mainstream/alternative as it has been constructed is extremely dubious.3 Even within its own ideological paradigm, it fails to investigate the historical mechanisms by which change is effected. Ultimately it precedes a kind of cultural Darwinism. 2Although the terms "alternate theatre" and "alternative theatre" have been used indiscriminately in Canada, the generation of theatres that emerged in the early 1970s have been known as "the alternates," following the usage most common in Toronto at that time. 3That there has been very little work on Canadian theatre history from a feminist analysis is problematic considering the important role feminist theatres have played in the last two decades, and considering that one of the earliest political performances in Canada was Nellie McClung's Parliament of Women in Winnipeg in 1903. For an analysis of women in contemporary Canadian theatre, see Rina Fratecelli, "The Status of Women in the Canadian Theatre," Report prepared for The Status of Women Canada, June 1982, unpublished. The report is discussed in Kate Lushington, "Fear of Feminism," Canadian Theatre Review 43 (Summer 1988): 5-11.</page><page sequence="3">PLAYING THE WOMAN'S PART / 203 I want to begin to unwind the central problem that I perceive by looking at the initial conflict posited between the mainstream and its radical opposition. The main- stream refers to the regional theatres-the system of civic theatres that came into being during the 1950s and 1960s in most major Canadian cities.4 It is difficult to generalize about these theatres: some embodied bourgeois cultural principles; others declared themselves as politically engaged. What they had in common was the agreement of the Canada Council that they would develop as the flagship theatres of their respective regions. This agreement translated into capital funding to construct or renovate large physical plants. Some of them were constructed by coalitions of various civic groups and community theatres with a strong ingredient of boosterism; others survived because of the dedication of a few founding individuals. What is important here is that it is difficult to impose uniformity: the histories of Regina's Globe Theatre, or Montreal's Centaur Theatre, for example, have more in common with the so-called alternates that with regionals like the Citadel Theatre in Edmonton or Toronto Arts Productions, precursor of CentreStage in the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts in Toronto. Despite these disparities, critics perceived the regional theatres as a system, one that consumed the lion's share of government funding. The arts councils for their part inherited in the mid 1970s dozens of small theatres that had begun on easily obtained but short-lived make-work LIP (Local Initiatives Projects) and OFY (Op- portunities for Youth) grants from the relatively nationalistic Liberal government of Pierre Trudeau. The councils, led by the Canada Council, encouraged the establish- ment of new theatres, but at the same time sought rational models of development. What they evolved through trial and error was a model that placed the alternates as satellites to the regional theatre, locked into place by funding categories. On paper, this model looked right: in the centre the regional theatre would act as a catalyst to validate the alternates. This model was dynamic and it admitted controversy. What could be better? It was the institutional realization of an ideological relationship between mainstream (which means big) and alternative (which means small), and which accorded with a bourgeois model that understands culture in terms of polarities: high/low, establishment/avant-garde, commercial/experimental. In the theatre com- munity, this model came to represent the institutionalization of an ideological debate about culture situated on the issue of the Canadian playwright. The regionals were perceived as anglomaniac and hostile to indigenous playwriting, and the alternatives pro-Canadian. That perception was fuelled by the fact that the larger theatres were generally run by community boards rather than artists, and thus had less interest in 4The "regionals" were generally understood to include: in Nova Scotia, Neptune Theatre (Halifax); in Prince Edward Island, Charlottetown Festival; in New Brunswick, Theatre New Brunswick (Fred- ericton); in anglophone Quebec, Centaur Theatre (Montreal); in Ontario, Toronto Arts Productions (later CentreStage); National Arts Centre (Ottawa); Sudbury Theatre Centre; Grand Theatre (London); Stratford Shakespearean Festival; Shaw Festival (Niagara-on-the-Lake); Magnus Theatre (Thunder Bay); in Manitoba, Manitoba Theatre Centre (Winnipeg); in Saskatchewan, Globe Theatre (Regina); in Alberta, Theatre Calgary; Citadel Theatre (Edmonton); in British Columbia, Vancouver Playhouse and Bastion Theatre (Victoria). There were no theatres in this category in Newfoundland, the Yukon, or the Northwest Territories.</page><page sequence="4">204 / Alan Filewod the development of new work than in the advancement of subscription sales. The equation of nationalism with alternative perhaps reached its apogee in the middle of the decade when a group of nationalist academics in Ottawa founded the Great Canadian Theatre Company with the mandate of performing only Canadian plays and hiring only Canadian artists. Reflecting on this in 1979, one of the founders wrote that I regret that this insistence upon doing Canadian theatre was, and to some extent, is radical. But it is. As we observed time and again; when companies in Ottawa didn't do anything Canadian for three, four, or five years no critic or commentator turned a hair. But when we decided to do only Canadian theatre we were described as that 'narrowly nationalistic', that 'chauvinistic', that 'militantly nationalist' company.5 From a distance the concentric model of mainstream theatres and satellite alternates seemed to describe the situation adequately. However, it did not describe the situation in Newfoundland, where there was no regional theatre and where Actors' Equity refused the "alternate" Mummers Troupe, a political intervention theatre, the stan- dard studio contract given to small theatres because Newfoundland had no regional theatre to which the Mummers might be considered an alternative. Nor did it describe the situation in New Brunswick where the regional theatre, Theatre New Brunswick, behaved more like an alternate by encouraging local playwrights and decentralizing its operation in several small cities; nor in Toronto where rapid changes invalidated it almost as soon as it was proposed; nor in Manitoba, where the Manitoba Theatre Centre pursued an erratic course, depending on the artistic director; nor in British Columbia where the same could be said of the Vancouver Playhouse. The only place where that model seemed to work was in Edmonton where Joe Shoctor, the powerful lawyer who founded and still governs the Citadel Theatre, straddled the mainstream and defied anyone else to "jump his claim." This model of alternative and mainstream seemed to make sense when the lines were drawn on the issue of Canadian playwrights, but that was not an institutional condition; it was a matter of how the institutions were used. After all, there were self-defined alternates that expressed less interest in Canadian drama than many of the so-called regionals. The construction of the mainstream was in effect an ideological fiction that rationalized larger grants to certain theatres on the basis of box office sales (or community penetration) and physical assets. Beyond that, the stream became a confusing delta: any category that lumps the left-wing populism of the Globe Theatre with the Stratford Festival is obviously problematic. Yet it is this category that un- derlies the whole concept of the alternative theatre, which is commonly represented as the radical challenge to a bourgeois model of theatre. Part of the problem can be attributed to critical tradition, which has a demonstrated need to reconcile the Canadian experience with a eurocentric historical discourse.6 5Robin Mathews, letter to the editor, Canadian Theatre Review 24 (Fall 1979): 134. 6This is the thesis of Usmiani's Second Stage: The Alternative Theatre Movement in Canada. Usmiani precedes her analysis by placing it in the European context of alternative theatre with its major references to the Artaudian and Brechtian traditions.</page><page sequence="5">ALTERNATIVE ORTHODOXY IN CANADIAN THEATRE / 205 . . . . .. .-.-. Nov_.ae- og- -49-: .. . .._. The Citadel Theatre, Edmonton, Alberta. Photo: Ed Ellis. Because the Canadian theatre carries references to the European model of bourgeois and avant-garde art and the postmodern tradition, critics have attempted to transpose their analyses. The eurocentric discourse is an essentially colonial revival of the idea of a New World that extends the experience of the old. It seeks to explain the development of Canadian theatre in terms of a dialectic that explains particularly European affinities of aesthetics and institutional structures. Perhaps more importantly, the problem is geographical: if the Canadian theatre cannot be understood by the experience of other societies, neither have all areas of the country followed the same development pattern. Nevertheless, the attempt to define the Canadian experience has tended to impose an ideological uniformity. The recognition of this paradox has led to a general acceptance of the theory of regionalism to explain the significant differences encountered across the country.7 Regionalism is an attempt, an imperfect one I believe, to reconcile institutional and thematic structures. It only works in reference to an implied center that is in critical practice, as opposed to theory, usually located in Toronto. That in turn constructs Toronto as the paradigm of Canadian culture by which regional variations can be measured. This condition is built into the formulation of the alternative/mainstream problem- atic, because the labels are themselves taken from the Toronto experience. Because Toronto is the de facto cultural capital of Canada (which may only mean that it has the largest concentration of critics) its development is taken as representative of the country at large. Although the opposite is more likely the case, I want to focus on the Toronto experience, not because I think it is more important or more central than that of any other city, but because it is from Toronto that the mostly Toronto-based critics have drawn their normative principles. 7See Diane Bessai, "The Regionalism of Canadian Drama," Canadian Literature 85 (1980), and Robert Wallace, "Writing the Land Alive: Playwriting in English Canada," in Anton Wagner, ed., Contem- porary Canadian Theatre: New World Directions (Toronto: Simon and Pierre, 1985).</page><page sequence="6">206 / Alan Filewod It is generally conceded that the Toronto alternate theatre had its sources in political radicalism. Certainly something happened in those signal years of 1970 and 1972. In 1970 the three major hits of the Toronto theatre scene were all expressions of the so-called radical spirit: at Toronto Workshop Productions Chicago '70, a documentary satire of the Chicago Seven conspiracy trial, ran for three months; at Studio Lab Theatre Dionysus in 69 (the first professional production of the play outside of New York) had become Dionysus in 70; and at the Royal Alexandra Theatre, Toronto's oldest commercial house, Hair, still celebrated an ideal that died that same year at Kent State. 1970 was also the year of the Festival of Underground Theatre, during which the new St. Lawrence Centre played inadvertent host to groups as diverse as Bread &amp; Puppet Theatre and le Theatre de la Panique. In 1970, alternate theatre was underground (at times literally: Theatre Passe Muraille originally performed in an underground garage), "off-Yonge," and consciously radical, its politics and much of its repertoire informed by the American experience. It described itself as "experi- mental," appropriating that term to mean iconoclastic. Ironically, the nationalist axis that characterized the later alternate theatre movement was inverted in 1970, when Toronto Arts Productions, the St. Lawrence Centre's main tenant which grew to be the bogey of the alternate theatres, initiated itself with an all-Canadian premiere season. By 1972, Toronto Arts Productions was leaning heavily towards the classics and the alternate theatre appeared very different: it was nationalistic- detractors called it xenophobic-and it expressed its nationalism in a rediscovery of self. This was a theatre of collective creations and documentaries that articulated the Canadian voice, and of kitchen-sink naturalism that returned a distinctly Canadian gaze. It was the theatre of Passe Muraille's groundbreaking rural documentary The Farm Show and David French's naturalistic melodrama Leaving Home. This was a theatre of cultural reclamation and postcolonial consolidation which sought to express its difference from the American experience that had originally informed it.8 This change in the project of the alternate theatre was the result of an overdeter- mination in the theatre at a time of cultural contradiction between colonialism and nationalism in the arts. The alternative theatre appropriated the aesthetics of the "international" avant-garde as a means of expressing its difference and autonomy. The convergence of several social crises--of nationalism, of the counter-culture move- ment, and of a generational surge resulted in a theatre that perceived itself in terms of its difference from a social mainstream that it rejected as colonised, middle-class, and middle-aged. This overdetermination, which identified alternative aesthetics with alternative politics (and which ironically accorded with the federal government's expressed interest in cultural nationalism in the early 1970s), established a myth of the alternate theatre at odds with the facts. This myth accepts the evolutionary fallacy that describes 8The evolution of Canadian theatre, and particularly of collective creation, is discussed as a strategy of postcolonial definition in Alan Filewod, Collective Encounters: Documentary Theatre in English Canada (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1987).</page><page sequence="7">ALTERNATIVE ORTHODOXY IN CANADIAN THEATRE / 207 : i i. : ~~i,::%i;ii:l:il:i:::::ii:::;i::.;L~B~,, ~Bi~s~L~i~i r~i ":"::? ii ;::;, :: :: :r ::;":~* ?i :I~::~ ; i:t Fina MacDonnel, Ann Anglin, David Fox, Janet Amos, Miles Potter, The Farm Show, Toronto: Theatre Passe Muraille (1972). cultural development in generational and anthropomorphic terms, constructed Ca- nadian culture as something that grows from colonial infantilism to an undefined "world-class" maturity. This same principle is at work in the hypothetical convergence of alternate and mainstream that is said to typify the theatre of the present day. It is commonly stated then that the experience of the alternate theatre in Toronto saw a shift in ideological emphasis from generational ("radical") to nationalist politics.9 The problem is that this model cannot account for its contradictions, particularly those which attempt to equate the institutional placement of various theatres with their ideological alignment. To mention only one example, if the so-called radical theatre of 1970 is the source of the alternate theatre in Toronto, then Ed Mirvish's overtly commercial Royal Alexendra Theatre must be considered a forerunner of the 'See for example, Denis Johnston, "Diverting the Mainstream: Bill Glassco and the Early Years of Tarragon Theatre," Canadian Drama 13:2 (1987).</page><page sequence="8">208 / Alan Filewod alternate theatre-because Hair was no less (in retrospect, perhaps no more) radical that Tom Paine and Futz, the two performances that established a radical reputation for the early Theatre Passe Muraille. What differed was that Hair was a business venture and Tom Paine was not. To reject the Royal Alex as a forerunner of the alternate theatre, then, is to put the defining criteria not on repertoire but on the context of production. By the mid-1970s, however, the definition of alternate theatre in Toronto was normally based on repertoire, or more precisely, the nationality of the repertoire. If the original criteria for alternate status were contextual, then it is clear that the alternate theatre in Toronto preceded the so-called mainstream not just by a few years but by several decades. Its origins lie in the Workers' Experimental Theatre and its successor, the Theatre of Action in the 1930s.10 The workers' theatres sought new ideological and structural contexts for the making of theatre. Their emphases on collectively and cultural politics established a tradition that George Luscombe carried on when he founded Toronto Workshop Productions in 1959. Luscombe, who had travelled to England to spend five years with Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop in the 1950s and who founded his theatre on her model, trained a generation of artists and infused the theatre around him with a radical spirit, both in terms of external politics and the politics of the theatre. In 1970, the alternate theatres were clearly the successors of the political theatre that had if not thrived at least struggled in Toronto for forty years. The theatre of the mid-1970s represented more than a maturation of that political alternative theatre, and to argue that the one grew into the other confuses the issue and invalidates the work of subsequent political theatres as undeveloped and im- mature. The sources of the nationalist theatre can also be traced back to the 1930s, to a time when the vision of a network of civic regional theatres across the country was challenged by a populist alternative. The regional theatre system had ben an- ticipated as early as 1897, when Hector Charlesworth, critic for the Toronto Evening News, called for government subsidies as a corrective to the inanity of the commercial stage."1 The civic theatre ideal was commonly expressed in the subsequent decades by critics and cultural politicians -foremost among them B. K. Sandwell and Vincent Massey, who adapted the nascent British model of subsidized civic theatre as an alternative to American monopoly control of the theatre in Canada.12 This proposal 'oCritics have accepted as a truism the hypothesis that the Workers Theatre Movement of the 1930s offers no direct links with the postwar alternative theatre. Robin Endres states the case against such links in her "Introduction" to Richard Wright, ed., Eight Men Speak and Other Plays from the Canadian Workers' Theatre (Toronto: New Hogtown Press, 1976). That proposition needs to be chal- lenged because of the number of activists who overlapped both periods, because the concept of "direct links" is the product of an empiricist historiographic method that is unable to account for ideological developments in society, and because it marginalizes the ongoing project of political intervention theatre.

The nationalist alternative theatre of the 1970s was not an overnight conversion of politically radical theatres. It was the modern articulation of a challenge first presented in 1933, when Archibald Key, writing in Canadian Forum, envisioned that Canada's national theatre would be a little red schoolhouse and a Ford van somewhere on the prairies.13 This was a vision of a postcolonial theatre that rejected imported models of development and sought its structures in the au- diences it was designed to serve. Although many of the alternate theatres of the 1970s never visited that little schoolhouse, the majority of them shared that com- mitment to an autonomous postcolonial theatre. For most of them that meant a commitment to the Canadian playwright. I am left at this point then with two models of the alternate theatre that overlap but do not accord. On the one hand, there is the theatre that defines itself as alternative by virtue of its expressed values. This is the political theatre that speaks for a defined constituency, and which may include a variety of institutional structures and aesthetic approaches. On the other hand, there is the theatre that defines alternative in terms of its relations to the institutional structures of Canadian culture: this is the theatre of postcolonial nationalism. When these two tendencies overlap, as they did in Toronto in the early 1970s, that overdetermination can engender a critical confusion that tries to comprehend both under the one label of alternative. If the idea of an alternative theatre is a determining factor in contemporary Canadian theatre history, then the idea of a mainstream is a necessary corollary that is equally confusing, because of the false unity it imposes on a complex reality. Even as the dialectic of alternate/mainstream is enshrined in the discourse of theatre criticism in this country, it is challenged in the theatre itself by terms that undermine that dialectic. The first of these terms is "the fringe." It too accepts marginalization as a condition of its formation, but its metaphor is posited in terms of spacial centrality rather than bipolarity. The fringe perceives theatrical difference in structural and institutional terms, a perception that has definite aesthetic implications but no nec- essary aesthetic coherence or unity. The second term also expands a tendency obscured by the alternative label: that is the popular theatre. As it has come to be known, popular theatre refers not to a genre or form in itself, but the application of theatre as a tool of political or social were both influenced by William Archer and Harley Granville-Barker's scheme for a national theatre in Britain. From this they extracted the principle of publicly subsidized theatres. They recognized, however, that because of geographical conditions, Canada's national theatre must be a decentralized network of theatres across the land. Massey built upon this idea in the Report of The Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters, and Sciences (Ottawa, King's Printer, 1951). The Massey Report became the guiding document of the Canada Council, which was established to implement the recommendations of his commission. It can be argued that these critics responded to the perceived colonization of Canadian culture by American monopoly capital by reverting to an older colonial allegiance to a cultural model derived from Britain.

Much of the energy behind the popular theatre movement comes from the development education sector; at present there are countless community groups - a large proportion of them initiated by women and Native peoples--across Canada that use theatre as a means of empowerment in political struggle. Some of them are professional theatres, like Edmonton's Catalyst Theatre, which initiates projects with marginalized and disenfranchised communities; most however are on-time grass- roots projects working on grants from social agencies and government action pro- grams. 14 Both the fringe and popular theatre have developed rapidly in the last decade and both are celebrated by regular national festivals, chief among them the annual Fringe festivals in Victoria, Vancouver, Edmonton, and Winnipeg, and the biannual festivals of the Canadian Popular Theatre Alliance. Implicit in the acceptance of these terms (which themselves need to be challenged as reductive) is the recognition that the label of alternative theatre no longer suffices to express the particular characteristics of these tendencies. In fact, it never did suffice. The idea of the alternative theatre is a rhetorical strategy which erases the fact that what is constituted as fringe and popular today were integral, overlapping, but essentially contradictory elements in the very formation of the independent theatre of the 1970s. 14For a survey of popular theatre in Canada see Canadian Theatre Review 53 (Winter 1987). The issue includes articles on popular theatre projects with Inuit and Dene women in the arctic; with striking workers in Alberta; with homeless shelter projects in Toronto; and with women in the workplace.
