<plain_text><page sequence="1">76] Recent Literature Bird-Banding 761 Recent Literature January to see." Approximately 150 species are presented in the present work, only one- third of those listed in Sprunt's revision (1954) of Howell's Florida Bird Life. Usually each species account or "bird biography" contains miscellaneous informa- tion on identification, seasonal occurrence, migration, nesting, food, habitats, and habits. The combination of color plates, small number of species included, con- cise accounts, and perhaps other factors will make this an attractive book to the uncritical tourist and bird-watcher. It is, however, unfortunate to detect gross errors throughout the book Not only are some common names incorrect ("Ruby-Throated Kinglet") but also there are abundant factual errors. All grebes, even those found in Florida, don't have "short-cone-shaped bills." There is no definite evidence that the Sharp- shinned Hawk breeds in the state. Broad-winged Hawks are not in the family Falconidae. The Florida subspecies of the Sandhill Crane does not "breed only in Florida." To state that a towhee is "a bird without a single bad habit . . ." and is "on the honor roll of the U. S. Department of Agriculture as a defender of Florida truck crops . . ." is beyond my comprehension! Had these and many other errors and misspellings been corrected, the book would be far more attractive to this reviewer.-David W. Johnston. 61. The Birds of Shakespeare. James Edward Harting. 1965. A reprint of the first edition published in 1871. Argonaut, Inc. Chicago, Ill. 321pp. $7.50. Just 100 years ago Mr. Harting, an English lawyer and naturalist, started to write this book which occupied his "leisure hours for six years." This is one of a dozen books, written by him between 1866 and 1906; they are mostly on birds, two of them devoted to falconry. In this volume the author cites and explains innumer- able references to birds and other creatures in Shakespeare's writings. It is a treasure trove of pleasant, informative reading. Many ancient super- stitions, implied or referred to in the plays, are described and their authenticity debated. One opinion current in the plays is doubted by Mr. Harting, namely that snakes are deaf, but this belief was based on fact. In ancient times a vulture symbolized a compassionate person, "because during the 120 days of its nurture of its offspring, if food cannot be had, 'it opens its own thigh and permits the young to partake of the blood, so that they may not perish from want."' "The ecclesiasti- cal fathers transferred the Egyptian story from the vulture to the pelican." Curiously enough, though, the author accepts the fantastic notion, "current in olden times" and based on a verse in Job and another in the 147th Psalm, that Ravens fail to care for or feed their young until black feathers begin to appear on the latter (see review of Gwinner's paper; Bird-Banding, 36: 275-276, 1965). An appendix of 19 pages lists the ornithological allusions in all the plays and poems, while an index of 5 pages completes the volume. This unusual book in- spired our family to renew our acquaintance with Shakespeare's plays, a laudable activity in our over-busy, present day lives.-M. M. Nice. 62. John White and Edward Topsell / The First Water Colors of North American Birds. Edited by Thomas P. Harrison. 1964. University of Texas Press, Austin. 59 pp., 10 colored plates reproducing 19 water colors. $5.00. Were this book titled "Primitive Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth Century Water Colors of American Birds by Unknown Artists Presumably Based on Nonextant Paintings by John White" I would be less critical of its content. Mr. Harrison's text gives a short history of Edward Topsell (1572-1625), a British clergyman, writer of tracts and author of "The Historie of Four footed Beastes," 1607; "The Historie of Serpents," 1608; and an unpublished manuscript "The Fowles of Heaven" (The Historie of Birdes) which now reposes in the Henry E. Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Pasted into this manuscript are 124 bird pic- tures, among them 9 water colors which Topsell calls "Virginia birds." Mr. Harrison writes next about John White (died 159?), artist with the Roanoke voyages (1584-90), also cartographer, surveyor, military engineer, governor of the lost colony on Roanoke Island, and grandfather of Virginia Dare, first child of English ancestry born in North America. Mr. Harrison then goes on to tell something about bird names, Indian and English, as used by Topsell and others in the 15th and 17th centuries. The remainder of the book is devoted to the reproductions of 19 primitive water-color paintings, 10 found in the possession of John White's descendants a hundred years after his death and purported to be copies made by an unknown hand of some of John White's work. Below 9 of these</page><page sequence="2">Vol. XXXVII Recent Literature [77 1966 pictures are copies of each made in the early 17th century by another unknown hand for the use of Reverend Topsell, his unpublished "Virginia Birds." Water-color painting was a highly developed technique by the year 1500 and John White, born much later in the century, was an artist of stature. His original pictures as recently reproduced in "The American Drawings of John White" by David Beers Quinn (1964) show him to have been a man who gave great attention to detail. His water-color of a Flamingo is as fine and as beautiful as any painting by Fuertes or by Singer. To introduce his excellent work to an audience through reproductions of crude copies misrepresents the ability, technique, and talent of a fine artist. We have no assurance that John White did the first water-color paintings of North American birds. Much untouched material still reposes in European archives, and the first water colors of birds may well have been done by some Spaniard or Frenchman before John White was born, though none has yet come to light. But John White was definitely the first English artist to paint North American birds. The first North American birds John White painted, of which the originals survive in the British Museum, were the Tropic Bird, the Frigate Bird, the Brown Booby, and the Noddy Tern. The paired pictures in Mr. Harrison's book are identified by Roger Tory Peterson as Female Red-eyed Towhee, Eastern Bluebird, Yellow-shafted Flicker, Blue Jay, Common Grackle (without a Topsell copy), Red-wing, and Oriole (possibly Baltimore), Common Loon, Male Red-eyed Towhee, and Sandhill Crane. Of the oriole Mr. Peterson says, "But if it is actually a Virginia bird it would have to be the Baltimore-unless the boat stopped at tropical American ports." The ship did stop at tropical American ports. White did not label his paintings with place names or dates. He made at least five trips to Virginia and started painting flora and fauna when on his first voyage in 1585 the expedition stopped to trade with the Spanish in Puerto Rico and Haiti. During his fifth voyage in 1590 White spent months in the West Indies. As the oriole painting most closely resembles the Troupial, Icterus icterus (according to Oliver L. Austin, Jr.), it may well have been a cage bird brought from mainland South America to the West Indies, as so many birds were by Spanish aviarists.-Elizabeth S. Austin. 63. The Personality of the Bird. Edited by Brandt Aymar. 1965. Crown Publishers, Inc., New York, N. Y. 170 pp., 29 black and white illustrations. $4.95. Mr. Aymar justifies his title by giving each of 37 bits and pieces of bird-inspired writing a new anthropomorphic super-title thus: "The Lovelorn Bird" is Percy Bysshe Shelley's "A Widow Bird": "The Reliable Bird" is "To the Cuckoo" by Michael Bruce; "The Lonely Bird' is "Seekonk, the Sea Gull" by Paul Annixter; "The Harmonious Bird" is a tern (no species given) in a story called "Victory" by Herbert Evans; and "The Uncooperative Bird" is a Bald Eagle in an excerpt from Saul Bellow's novel "The Adventures of Augie March." Mr. Aymar might be called a "downy bird" for finding a reason to put such authors as Alfred Lord Tennyson, Albert Payson Terhune, Emily Dickinson, Don Tracy, John Burroughs, Edward Lear, Ernest Thompson Seton, John Keats, Herbert Ravenel Sass, and Shelley and Bellow under one cover. The publisher's blurb on the jacket calls this book an anthology. Webster's Dictionary defines anthology as "a collection of flowers of literature." Mr. Aymar's collection of writings does not live up to this definition. In his choice of works by great literary names, he seems to have selected examples of their more mediocre writing. In these articles, essays, verses, and short stories Mr. Aymar has collected an astonishing amount of misinformation about birds. According to Paul Annixter, for instance, gulls live to be close to a hundred years old, pelicans summer in Hud- son Bay, a gull's voice croaks with age, and individual adult gulls of the same species vary as much as two inches in length! A talking chimney swallow, a philo- sophizing, conversational mockingbird, and an emotional gannet are the motifs for three stories. Several accounts of the behavior of caged and tamed birds are factual and good. The excerpt from "Blind Jack" by Stephanie Ryder, although out of con- text, is among the best of these. "Good-by, Black Prince" by Elizabeth Waldo Wright and "Raff, the Jungle Bird" by Zetta and Carveth Wells are two more good ones. The articles by Ernest Thompson Seton, Herbert Ravenel Sass, and John Burroughs are what one would expect from these naturalist authors, well written, full of information, and factually correct.</page></plain_text>
