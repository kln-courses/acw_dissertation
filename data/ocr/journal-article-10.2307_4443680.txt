<plain_text><page sequence="1">Zoology LIZARDS AS PETS, by Richard Headstrom. 1971. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadel- phia and New York. 159 p. $4.95. As a source of general information about lizards the book is adequate for use by older children and by adults. The blending of items of general in- terest with technical details results in easy and interesting reading. The pho- tographs are excellent and the format is attractive. The discussion of 26 of the common lizards of the United States would enable one to find speci- mens and care for them. Lizards as Pets is partly a compendium from other sources, blended with the author's ob- servations. The author's attempt at popularization includes much teleology and anthropomorphism. Hobby-naturalists, school librarians, life-science teachers, and anyone who enjoys unusual pets will have use for this book. J. Carl Bass Kansas State College Pittsburg</page></plain_text>
