<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNITY AND MEANING OF EURIPIDES' HERACLES *) BY J. C. KAMERBEEK Among the so-called alphabetical plays the Heracles is perhaps the one about which we are inclined to wonder most why it was not included in the number of selected tragedies alongside Medea and Hippolytus and instead of, for instance, Andromache or Rhesus. For whatever its defects?if any?it is a great play and central to our comprehension and appreciation of Euripides' art and view of life. I for one am on the side of Browning and inclined to quote, when reading it again: "Accordingly I read the perfect piece" *), and in my opinion Wilamowitz' choosing it as the starting point for his great career in the interpretation of Greek Tragedy is meaningful. But perhaps the unknown ancient grammarian who is responsible for the selection of nine or ten commented plays is to be thought of as a forerunner of Swinburne, whose startling verdict you will remember ("a grotesque abortion" 2)) or of Murray and his statement 3) ("I do not mean that I consider the Heracles of Eur. to be a very great work of art. I do not. It is broken- backed . . ."). But apart from this diversity of general evaluation it has to be observed that among modern scholars an even moderate communis opinio as to the structure and the meaning of the play is far from having been reached. The main problem, to which different solu- tions have been proposed, is the relation between part I (up to and including Lycus' murder) and part II (Heracles' madness, the mur- der of wife and children). How is the unity of these parts, if unity there is, to be conceived?

Further problems are for instance : should we distinguish two or three parts of the play? What share does tradition have and what Euripides' personal view in the representa- tion of Heracles ? What about the action of the gods and the appa- rent inconsistencies in their r?le? And so forth. Since it has been argued, not so long ago *), that the play owes its remarkable structure to the fact that part I had been originally conceived as one tragedy (with a happy ending) and that the poet thought only afterwards of adding Heracles' madness and the rest, and since, on the other hand, Mr. H. H. O. Chalk, in his outstanding paper '??et? and ??a in Euripides Herakles 2), following in the wake of Sheppard 3), has convincingly argued for the unity of the play on the strength of some recurrent themes which pervade the whole of it, it will be as well to state from the start which elements, in my view, have to be taken into consideration when we embark upon an examination of its unity and meaning. The degree to which a play has unity may be described as depend- ing on a number of factors: (i) on the close or not so close inter- relation between its scenes and acts, (2) on the greater or lesser degree of strikingness in recurrent motifs in imagery and ideas, (3) on the greater or lesser plausibility of the successive speeches and actions of the dramatis personae, (4) on the greater or lesser relevancy of the choral odes, but its unity has also to be considered in relation to the curve of tension and relaxation in the mind of the spectator: since however no reliable standard for measuring the latter can be found, we had better leave them out of account. A scrutiny of these four points or aspects will certainly yield some results, but in the case of Greek Tragedy it will not be enough. In the elucidation of a Greek tragedy we should never lose sight of the elementary fact that it is an interpretation of myth or saga. And although it is true that, at any rate with Euripides, we may safely and confidently assert that tragedy is also, or even more, an inter- pretation by means of myth or saga of the state of man, it is also ?)

Sheppard, The Formal Beauty of the Hercules Furens, CL Qu. 1916, 72-80.</page><page sequence="3">UNITY AND MEANING OF EURIPIDES HERACLES 3 true that he never drew the main subject-matter for his tragedies from elsewhere than from myth and saga. This fact is highly impor- tant for solving at least one problem of the Heracles. The story of Lycus' usurpation, the extreme distress of Heracles' family and He- racles' revenge on Lycus did not so far as we are aware belong to mythological tradition, but the murder of Heracles' children by the hero himself did. So the central act from which the idea of writing a tragedy on Heracles sprung up in the mind of Euripides must have been Heracles' madness and onslaught on his children. If nothing else does, then this consideration alone must suffice to explode the above-mentioned theory about the double action of the play and also the hardly less unhappy idea that the madness and its consequences should be deemed incidental to the action of part 11). So it must be evident that part I has been construed by the poet in order to lead up to Heracles' act of madness and the merits or demerits of the interrelation between part I and II should be weighed from that point of view. In connection with this another important fact has to be stressed, as is rightly done by the majority of interpreters. I am of course referring to the well-known circumstance that whereas common tradition placed the madness and the murder of the children before the labours in the service of Eurystheus 2), Euripides has reversed the order of events. So the labours are not a penalty, an expiation for his own crime ; although carried out in the service of Eurystheus as a price for which the return to Argos has to be bought 3), their character of great and good deeds for the benefit of humanity is throughout stressed. From this reversed order of events it follows also that part III of the play (the act after the murder with Theseus' intervention) has to be considered as Euripides' free invention (Theseus' intervening before the labours is impossible; so his inter- vention has not been borrowed from traditional mythology). (I note in passing that it is more satisfactory to consider the play i) As is suggested by G. L. Hendrickson, The Heracles Myth and its Treat- ment by Euripides, Univ. of Wisconsin Stud, in Lang, and Lit., Class. Stud, in Honour of C. F.

In part III we may expect to find many clues to the meaning of the play as a whole for it is indubitably the very personal finale concluding his very personal treatment of a mythical datum and so in fact we do, as Mr. Ehrenberg has correctly stated 2). But I venture to disagree with him when he calls this last part "from the artistic point of view a weak and flat anti-climax". For apart from its other qualities (cp. Murray 3) : "for sheer loftiness of tragic tone the last act . . . will stand beside anything in ancient drama"), by its very relevance to the tragic issues of the preceding drama it is, in my opinion, a fitting and moving closing act of a perplexing tragedy. It would be easy to demonstrate that the prologue and the three episodia up to Lycus' murder by themselves form a very satis- factory dramatic action, comparable to others in Euripides' plays in which suppliants at an altar are ultimately rescued from mortal peril. Nobody denies it and the demonstration may be dispensed with. The question is whether or not and if so, by which means and to what extent, interrelations and connexions between these and the following parts of the play are discernible in more than the most general terms. The same holds good for the lyrics, rich and elaborated in the first part, scarce in the rest (there are no stasima after 1. 814, end of the third stasimon, 600 lines before the end of the play4) ). First of all we may ask ourselves to what extent in the case of this myth the consciousness and the expectations of the spectator would be analogous to those in the case of an Oedipus tragedy, for instance, or the Ajax of Sophocles. In following the action and the speeches and dialogues of the Oedipus the spectator's mental experience would always balance between fear and hope (against his better knowing). Should we regard the murder of the children by their father's hand as a feature of saga as fixed and constant as Ajax' suicide? In that case the tragic irony of the first part (the seeming salvation which ?) Cf. H. Strohm, Euripides, Interpretationen zur dramatischen Form (M?nchen 1957), IQ8. 2) V. Ehrenberg, Tragic Heracles, Aspects of the Ancient World (1946), 161. 3) L.c, 112. 4) I fail to see why this fact should be in favour of the view that the second and third parts were a later addition, as is argued by Carri?re.</page><page sequence="5">UNITY AND MEANING OF EURIPIDES HERACLES 5 in the second part turns into a destruction much more appalling than Lycus' intentions, if carried out, would have brought about) would gain, so to speak, an extra dimension. But we cannot tell for certain. The possibility, however, of "tragic irony" (and there- with of a strong interrelation between the first part and the rest) remains (i) because the poet at all events knows what he is after, (2) because?in my opinion?the events, the spectacles, the utteran- ces in the first part of a play have to be seen in the light of what follows as well as the reverse. And although it is true that in a sense the poet has done his utmost to render the second reversal of fortune as sudden and bewildering as possible, there are some details in part I which would seem to make the attentive hearer pause?not as an afterthought but even before the central event, even without any knowledge of the terrible things to come, whereas there are a great number of them which only become meaningful after the event?indeed, I do not hesitate to assert that the whole of part I yields its full meaning only when seen in the light which the subse- quent parts are to shed on it. Since Wilamowitz' comment on the matter it has been generally acknowledged that the spectacle of Heracles taking in tow his children when he enters his house finds its counterpart in Heracles following Theseus, pa???e?? ?f????de?, at the end of the play1), with the corpses of the children and Megara in the background. But the spectacle of Megara and the children with Amphitryon at the moment of Heracles' arrival and of Heracles sleeping among his victims after the murder with Amphitryon watching in utter distress2) form an equally contrasting pair, expressive of the absolute contrast between the highest hope of salvation and the reality of the most fearful doom. In her first speech Megara declares that she and Heracles' children ???? ?p? pte???? / s??? ?e?ss??? ????? ?? ?fe??????will be murdered (by Lycus) ; in fact she will die under Heracles' hand together with the last child whom she tries to protect 3).

Indubitably such ironies are to be heard in Megara's words (fifty lines before Heracles' arrival) where she describes how Heracles had wanted to bequeath his inheritance to his sons: e? de???? te s?? ??e??t????? / ????? ? a ? ? e ? da?da???, ?e?d? d?s??

Cf. further 481 with 870 (the ???a?). Again, the last words of the Parodos (130-137) are full of elements suggest- ive of the tragic pattern of the play as a whole. The Chorus, on seeing the unhappy children, exclaims: ?dete, pat???? ?? ???- / ??pe? a?de p??sf??e?? ????t?? a??a? ("See! how the stern glances of those eyes are like their father"?Paley). ?????pe? has in itself a certain ambivalence. We are reminded of it when Lyssa announces the first symptoms of Heracles' madness: ?? ?d??* ?a? d? t???sse? ???ta ?a???d?? ?p? / ?a? d?ast??f??? e??sse? s??a ?????p??? ???a? (867, 8) and again in the Messenger's story ? d' ?????p?? ???a G??????? st??f?? (99? )&gt; when Heracles is in the act of murdering the children 2). And in the following words the close connection between Heracles' ill-fate and his children's doom is over-emphasized by the remarkable wording: t? d? ?a??t???? ?? ?????pe? ?? t????? (?33)&gt; which words in the direct context do not mean more than "his ill-luck has not left the children", but which, in the context of the whole tragedy, are suggestive of the idea that the doom of the children is bound up with Heracles' general doom, willed by Hera or Fate. And the Parodos' closing words, notwithstanding the rescue from Lycus' assault, will ultimately prove a true prophecy. Offence has often been taken at the digressive character of Amphitryon's defence of Heracles' bow and arrows against Lycus' disparaging taunts about Heracles the archer (188-203^158-164). But we should not forget that the bow is used, throughout the play, as the symbol of Heracles' a?et?3) : it is constantly associated with his ?) 969 sqq. 2) Moreover Lyssa herself is called G?????, 883. 3) The point has been impressively made by Chalk, I.e., 14, n. 33.</page><page sequence="7">UNITY AND MEANING OF EURIPIDES HERACLES 7 deeds of prowess but it is also the main instrument in the onslaught on his wife and children. Amphitryon is sounding the praises of the weapon that will prove fatal to Heracles' dearest relatives and the tragic irony of the passage is not to be overlooked. This, of course, much heightens its relevance, permitting us to regard an apparent digression as a structural element of the play1), "t?? ??? d?d?s? t??a;" Heracles is reported to cry out at the beginning of his mad- ness 2), and before following Theseus to Athens, at the very end of the tragedy, the hero movingly addresses his weapons, uncertain whether he should leave them behind or take them with him3). It is more than an interesting detail that he decides on the second course, for this decision implies that in the end he does not repudiate his former deeds of glory and that, also in this sense, Heracles remains Heracles. For Mr. Chalk is quite right in stressing the point that Heracles' final resolve to live on, which is a confirmation of his a?et?, does not imply a repudiation of his heroic past: it even excludes such a repudiation (But this does not mean that we should accept Wilamowitz' ???a?te??s? ???t?? instead of ???at?? at 1. 1351 : both Parmentier and Kroeker 4) have convincingly argued to the contrary ; the words mean : "Je veux braver la tentation de la mort"5), not: "I will await my death with patience"6)). Apart from other considerations it seems to me much more satisfactory if Heracles "overcomes" Death than if he ''endures" Life: thus the theme of his coming back from Hades is resumed in a sublimated way. In Mr. Chalk's opinion Euripides' prime concern in the play as a whole was : what is the place of human a?et? in the universe ?7). The a?et?-problem is the play: "the inexplicable overthrow by ?)

The themes p???t??, s?????, f???a, which, according to Sheppard, imply a coherent abstract argument of the play as a whole, have to be regarded as the interrelation of subordinates to the general concept of a?et? (thus Chalk1) ), and it is indubitably true that, when we search for the recurrence of these themes and for their relation to the central theme of a?et?, many passages, especially in the lyrics, whose relevance to the tragedy as a whole has often be doubted or even denied, become more meaningful and appear to bear more relevance to the wider context than at first sight they seemed to do. Thus it is entirely correct, in my view, to interpret the second stasimon both as looking back to Heracles' a?et? just displayed and as looking "forward (655 sqq., 669) to the brutal stupidity of the gods with which he is about to be rewarded" (Chalk, p. 8). e? de ?e??? ?? ???es?? ?a? s?f?a ?at' ??d?a?

It is true that divine justice is highly praised in the next lyrics (during and after Lycus' destruction) 6), but then this is sung just before the appearance of Iris and Lyssa and the delusion implied in these praises is immediately exposed.

Vellacott), is perhaps the most striking) finds its full expression in part III: for Theseus is the true f????, through whose intervention Heracles finds the way back to his true self. Human gratitude and solidarity are the only hope in a ruthless universe. For what about the gods in this tragedy? Although the traditional assumptions as to their r?le in Heracles' existence and fate have seemingly been taken for granted, these assumptions are set at naught by Heracles' famous so-called "Platonic" outburst 1340- 1346. Let it not too hastily be said that it is hardly necessary to take account of these words in an interpretation of the tragedy as a whole, for that is to beg the question. If we read 1. 1340 thus: ????? p??e??a &lt;?e?&gt; t?d' est' e??? ?a???, it is possible (but not necessary) to interpret: "what I am going to say has nothing to do with my evils". But what follows is evidently an answer to Theseus' lines 1314-1321, by which the latter has tried to restrain Heracles from suicide, pointing out that the gods never show any remorse for evil deeds. Now the true meaning of p??e??a would seem to be "irrelevant" *) and Theseus' argumentation is irrelevant in so far as Heracles is innocent of any conscious evil doing (Theseus' words might be defended as an argument a fortiori) ; it is perhaps better to supply t?? than ?e? between p??e??a and t?d' or even to read p??e??a ta?ta (clearly referring to Theseus' words) t?? e??? ?a??? (as suggested by Paley). What follows implies the repudiation of the very existence of the traditional anthropomorphic gods as gods but not of the evil powers responsible for Heracles' unhappy fate, and such a repudiation may correctly be considered to be the final conclusion to be drawn from the presentation of Heracles' fate in the preceding tragedy. For the underlying conviction throughout the tragedy is this that if the gods are gods justice must prevail, as it seems to do when at the end of part I Lycus is punished; but immediately thereafter "chaos is come again" and what for a moment seemed to be a universe ruled by divine justice turns out ?)

Different Pohlenz, Eri.2, 298.</page><page sequence="10">IO UNITY AND MEANING OF EURIPIDES HERACLES to be the playground of arbitrary evil without any redeeming feature except for the endurance of man and human friendship. In the preceding examination I have tried to show that the connecting links between the three parts of the tragedy are many, or rather that their interrelation is very close in almost every respect and the instances of recurrent images *), patterns of thought, important "themes" might be multiplied many times (for the latter I refer to the exhaustive treatment of Chalk). But at least one great problem remains, in the eyes of many scholars the central problem of the play. How are we to view the fact of Heracles' madness ? Is it to be regarded as a doom sent from without, if not by the gods then by some evil demon breaking into the mind of a man and crushing his life without any connection with the life he has led and with the structure of his"psyche" ? Or are we justified in searching also for an interpretation of the tragedy on, what for want of a better term we shall call, a psychological level? Wilamowitz' idea, briefly stated, amounts to this: Heracles' madness is the consequence of his megalomania, inherent in the Doric heroic ideal, embodied in his previous career of which we hear much in part I; it develops naturally and gradually and its symp- toms are clearly to be perceived in his furious outburst, when he prepares to take his revenge on Lycus. Wilamowitz' view is closely connected with his theory that Euripides has shown us in the first part an image of Heracles as the embodiment of ideal Doric man- hood in order to smash the image of this inadequate ideal by the act of madness and to introduce a regenerate Heracles in the final act of the play 2). Somewhat modified these ideas recur in Pohlenz' Die griechische Trag?die 3). But this will not do: it is not true that ?) The Heracles would lend itself to an analysis of its imagery with more fruitful results than many other Greek tragedies, the Antigone for example. 2) Wilamowitz, I.e., passim and especially I2, 127-132. But he did not stick to his views (Kl. Sehr. I, 1935, 466 = D.L. 47, 1926, 853-4). 3) Second edition, 297-300 (with polemics against Kroeker and others in the Erl?uterungen). The madness grows from Heracles' inner self, but through no fault of his. Perhaps too much is made of the fact that Heracles is cited as an example of the ?e?a???????? in Arist. Probi. 30, 1 and of the ?eta???a?- theory in Hipp. p. a???? c. 11 in relation to Heracles' "Umschwung". All the same there is much of value in Pohlenz' treatment of the problem and of the Heracles in general.</page><page sequence="11">UNITY AND MEANING OF EURIPIDES' HERACLES II Heracles is a specifically Doric hero nor that his image, evoked in the first part of the tragedy, is that of a somewhat archaic ideal of force and violence; rather is he represented as the benefactor of mankind and vindicator of justice. Wilamowitz' theory implies that Heracles, in the third part of the tragedy, should repudiate his glorious past, but we have seen that this is not the case. Moreover it should be stated that Heracles' furious thirst for revenge, when he heard of Lycus' awful crime x), is entirely justified and that he does not show, at that stage of the action, any signs of madness. On the contrary, his warm affection for his relatives is strongly underlined in the moving scene in which he enters his house before the death of Lycus 2). In his later years Wilamowitz does not seem to have held on to his psychological interpretation of Heracles. The case against Wilamowitz' ideas has been ably stated by Kroeker3) (among others), and with the exception of Pohlenz most interpreters have followed suit 4). Heracles (thus Kroeker) is the victim of a mental disease destructive of man, coming from without; no "innerseelisches Problem" lies at the base of Heracles' tragedy5). The Messenger's narrative does not lend support to any attempt at psychological interpretation. The very contrast between Heracles the triumphant saviour of part I and Heracles in his madness is the measure of his tragedy; no psychological bridge, so to speak, can be thrown across the gap between the two. Such a theory, attractive at first sight by its indubitably positive merits, is of course very pleasing to those interpreters, Z?rcher 6) above all, who are inclined to deny any consistency to Euripides' psychological delineation of character. And, generally speaking, Heracles is of course a special case. On the other hand, the Heracles ?) The reference is to 11. 565-573.

And Euripides is a sharp observer of reality, psychical and otherwise 2). When it is stated that Heracles, the benefactor of mankind, has to be thought of as entirely good 3), that no ????? in his acts has to be considered (and least of all in his slaying of Lycus 4) ) as a cause of his madness, which then would have been sent as a divine punishment (com- promising features of the Heracles saga, the murder of Iphitus e.g., are not mentioned by Euripides 5) ), that, in fine, there is no ques- tion of "crime and punishment", I entirely agree. I am equally convinced that no symptoms of madness are meant to be discernable during the scene of Heracles' entry and exit6). Its sudden onset is well calculated to bring about the most terrifying e?p????? in the mind of the spectator. But does the suddenness of a fit of madness entail the assumption that between it and the past life of its victim there exists no connection ? The actions of all Euripides' other "heroes" are determined by their past7), or rather the tragic figures of a given play and its action which decides their destiny are exclusively to be understood against the background of their past and antecedents.

If there is some truth in my contention that the madness must have been the germ from which Euripides' conception of this tragedy grew and if we bear in mind that he reversed for his purposes the traditional order of events x), so that the madness comes after the labours and not vice versa, it would be very strange indeed if no inner connection between the madness and Heracles' past were to be assumed. I want to draw your attention to the following points : 1. One of the arguments used by those who consider that the madness comes from without is of course the figure of Lyssa herself. Now it is strange that, according to Lyssa herself, the first symp- toms of madness have begun before she has entered the palace (867-870, 873) 2). She remains invisible to those within. It may well be asked whether Iris and Lyssa are much more than a very striking and terrifying theatrical device in order to let the Chorus and the audience know what is going to happen in the house. (There are some good remarks on this point in G. L. Hendrickson's article on the play3). The scene with Iris and Lyssa is of course not the Chorus' dream-vision, as Verrall would have it). But I do not want to stress this point too much. It is perhaps impossible to be certain whether or not the bodily demon coming from without is meant as a demon from within; there may be an interplay of traditional imagination and "modern", that is Euripidean, psy- chology. 2. In the dialogues as well as in the choral odes before Heracles' entry the audience is again and again confronted with Heracles' glorious deeds and his life of toils. He offers to Eurystheus a great price for his return: ????e??sa? ?a?a? (ig, 20). ?a? t??? ?e? ?????? ?) The reasons alleged for this by some scholars are, in my opinion, un- satisfactory.

And on top of all this, after his return from the nether world, he is faced with the disaster of his family and again has to wage a bloody fight. Is there anything phantastic in the assumption that, on the psychological level, the poet meant us to understand Heracles' madness as the violent reaction 2) to the overstrain of a burdensome life ? 3. The part played by Eurystheus in Heracles' life is mentioned for the first time by Amphitryon in the Prologue (19). That he toiled in the service of "the tyrant" is emphasized in the second stasimon (?????a?? p???? t??a???, 388; cp. 418) and by Heracles himself (580). Megara relates the remarkable fact that Heracles 1) 575 sqq. 2) Here I agree with Pohlenz.</page><page sequence="15">UNITY AND MEANING OF EURIPIDES' HERACLES 15 wanted his eldest son to inhabit Eurystheus' house as king of Argos (463, 4). Eurystheus' heralds by their announcements have caused Heracles' family to give him up as dead (551-553). Now Heracles' delusions in his madness take the form of the idea that he is on his way to Mycenae and that he is taking his revenge on Eurystheus. His madness declares itself by his wish to kill Eurys- theus *?), to carry back his head (936, 939), to destroy the Cyclopian walls (944), he utters terrible threats against Eurystheus (imagining himself in Mycenae) (962, 3). He thinks that his father is Eurystheus' father, his own children Eurystheus' (967, 970). After the first murder he cries out : ??? ?e? ?e?ss?? dde ?a??? ????s???? / e???a? pat??a? ??t???? p?pt??? ??? (9^2, 3)? From these facts it is clear, in my opinion, that the poet has meant us to understand that the connection between Heracles' life up till then and his madness is very close indeed. His labours in the service of Eurystheus (by which he had had to leave his family at the mercy of mortal peril) and the person of Eurystheus have taken the form of an obsession 2). In his normal state of mind he suppressed his thirst to revenge himself on the cause of his sufferings : his intention was to bring Cerberus to Eurystheus and ask the price for his labours, the return of himself and his family to Argos. But when the bonds of his rational being have been undone, the grudge takes possession of him and under the delusion of gratifying his thirst for vengeance he perpetrates the deeds of his own undoing. The ??a, the violence, inherent in his glorious actions 3) but used in the service of a noble end and controled by reason, has a brief moment of absolute and destructive rule. This interpretation is perhaps confirmed by the passage in part III, where Heracles requests Theseus' help in setting the reward for carrying the Cerbe- rus to Eurystheus (1386-1388; this must be, in my opinion, the correct interpretation of ????? ????st?a s???at?st?s??, not: "help ?) It is possible that Euripides is making use of versions in the saga, in which Heracles killed Eurystheus and three of his children, but for this there are no old sources available (Ath.

What is the meaning of these last words? Not of course that Heracles is afraid either of Cerberus or of Eurystheus. Some scholars have suggested that without Theseus' friendly company he might be tempted again to suicide 2). But I am rather inclined to think that Heracles is afraid of being overcome by a passionate thirst for revenge on seeing Eurystheus. The words, however, admit of both interpretations. We have spent some time in considering the possibilities of inter- pretation on a psychological level. I hope to have demonstrated that such an interpretation is not only possible, but also desirable and even necessary. But I am far from contending that it is exhaustive. In the course of this paper other aspects equally important for a correct understanding of the play have been taken account of. There is one level of interpretation on which I want to add a few words more. I mean the one which we might call symbolical. Is it possible briefly to state what meaning this image of man, as symbolized by Euripides' Heracles, may be said to bear for the Greeks of his time and also for us ? Perhaps something like this comes close to it : the best man, the benefactor of mankind, the exponent of active civilization against barbarism, is liable to overreach himself in the very exercise of his a?et?, but even then, without the help of any god but only with the support of human solidarity and by his own will-power, he will be able to overcome the terrible onslaught of evil Fate.
