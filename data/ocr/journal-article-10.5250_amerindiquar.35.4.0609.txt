<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Book Reviews Jeffrey Ostler. The Lakotas and the Black Hills: The Struggle for Sacred  Ground. New York: Viking, 2010. 238 pp. Cloth, $22.95. Peter A. Kindle, University of South Dakota In 1980, more than a hundred years after the Native American tribe called the  Lakotas were removed from the Black Hills, the US Supreme Court found that  this land had been taken without just compensation. The case had been making  its way through the courts for fi fty-seven years, but rather than celebrate this  victory and accept the offered compensation, the Lakotas rejected the payment.  They want their land back. Jeffrey Ostler, professor of history at the University  of Oregon, documents the intimate relationship between the Lakotas and the  Black Hills with 320 endnotes and great attention to detail. Ostler avoids explic- itly advocating for the return of the Black Hills to the Lakotas, but the attentive  reader may fi nd a tinge of this throughout the text. The fi rst hint may be in the  dedication, “For the next generation.” After a brief introduction highlighting the white man’s stamp of ownership  on the Black Hills—the faces carved into Mount Rushmore—Ostler begins by  sketching the archaeological fi ndings of human inhabitants of the Black Hills  and relating the scant written evidence. The Lakotas were the westernmost Sioux  tribe encountered by French explorers in the mid to late 1600s. The Seven Coun- cil Fires that comprised the Lakotas (Oglalas, Brulés, Minneconjous, Hunkpa- pas, Two Kettles, Shiasapas, and Sans Arcs) migrated westward to avoid confl ict  with other tribes or to tap richer hunting grounds. By the 1750s there is evi- dence that the Lakotas were established in villages along the Missouri River and  hunted on the plains east of the Black Hills. By 1804 Lewis and Clark encoun- tered Lakotas on their ascent of the Missouri and noted the confl ict between the  Lakotas and other Native American tribes occupying the southern Black Hills.  By the 1820s and early 1830s the Lakotas dominated the Black Hills, abandoned  </page> <page sequence="2"> their presence on the Missouri River, and were contending with other tribes for  hunting grounds west of the Black Hills. When did the Lakotas “discover” Paha Sapa, their name for the Black Hills?  Perhaps more importantly, at what point in their history did the Paha Sapa be- come sacred to them? Ostler does not reach a defi nitive conclusion but does  suggest that the link between the people and the land may be deeply anchored in  history. The voices of those who contend that the sacredness of the Black Hills  was a late invention of the Lakotas in the 1970s designed to strengthen their land  claim are presented along with a rich discussion of detailed evidence sugges- tive of a more ancient tribal connection to the Black Hills. Ostler gathered evi- dence from confl icting interpretations of the rawhide pictographs called “winter  counts,” brief retellings of the Lakota legends that are intricately linked to sites  in the Black Hills, evidence from Lakota cosmology, summer Sundance sites,  fi rst-person accounts from the few white men to spend time with the Lakotas in  the nineteenth century, and even twentieth-century accounts of Lakota visions. In the second chapter, Ostler’s historical account is less speculative. Begin- ning with the fi rst white American “overlanders” crossing Lakota territory on  their way to Oregon in 1841, the southern Platte River trails to the Denver and  Pikes Peak gold mines, and the northwestern Bozeman Trail to Montana’s gold,  Ostler describes the period from 1941 to 1865 as a time of increasing encroach- ments on Lakota land. The Fort Laramie Treaty (1851) had recognized approxi- mately 70 million acres that included the Black Hills as Lakotan, but the eco- logical decimation of the summer grasses necessary to sustain the buffalo herds  jeopardized the tribe’s way of life. The Fetterman Massacre (1865) stands as a  pointed example of their increasing desperation. In the third chapter Ostler turns his attention to the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty.  Though rather quickly violated by the US seizure of the Black Hills in 1876–77,  this treaty has strong warrant among the Lakotas even today and was the pri- mary legal foundation for the successful legal efforts of the twentieth century.  This treaty assured the Lakotas undisturbed use of 31 million acres, mostly west  of the Missouri River in South Dakota, which included the Black Hills. Hunting  rights to an additional 50 million acres between the Platte River on the south  and the Yellowstone River in the north were also assured. Implementation, as  Ostler so convincingly describes, fell somewhat short of these commitments. Chapter 4 tells of the last decade of independence for the Lakotas. Sitting Bull  and Crazy Horse did not sign the 1868 treaty and continued to lead opposition  to US encroachments on the Black Hills, but military victories (e.g., Custer’s  defeat in 1876) did not feed the tribes. The buffalo herds were nearly gone. The  Manypenny Commission “negotiated” another treaty ceding the Black Hills to  the United States in 1876, a concession made by the tribe as the sole alternative  to starvation. Following that winter, Crazy Horse surrendered, and Sitting Bull  led his people to Canada. 610 american indian quarterly/fall 2011/vol. 35, no. 4 </page> <page sequence="3"> In the second half of his book, Ostler reports the Lakotan efforts to regain  their land. Chapter 5 chronicles the hardships of survival on reservations, the  cultivation of Lakotan hopes by the Ghost Dance, more land grabs (i.e., the  Sioux Agreement of 1889), and the beginnings of Lakota legal challenges to the  1876 agreement. By 1911 a hero of sorts had stepped forward to advocate for the  Lakota claim to the Black Hills. For the next forty-fi ve years attorney Ralph Case  was to represent the tribe, failing at every turn to win a favorable judgment in  the appropriate federal court. This story of Case’s failures, the cultural changes  that took place in America following the Second World War, and the combined  political-legal machinations that led to the successful Supreme Court decision  in 1980 is contained in chapter 6. The Lakotas and a few Dakotas who were party to the claim won an award of  $102 million in 1980, $750 million by 2007, but much had changed in the century  since losing the Black Hills. The 1960s had given rise to Red Power and orga- nizations like the American Indian Movement and the National Indian Youth  Council. Money was no longer adequate satisfaction, despite the amount. The  Lakotas rejected the settlement and began new forms of advocacy for the return  of the land. Chapter 7 is a brief description of the political and legal efforts of  the 1980s, but it ends only with more deferred hope. The Lakota claim to the Black Hills has always been founded on the pre- vailing interpretation of history; accordingly, Ostler has attempted to provide  an accurate historical account. Readers more well versed in the historical de- tails may have a more informed critique of how well Ostler has met this goal,  but I found his account reasoned and informed. Those wishing to deny Lakota  claims, especially those centered on the religious signifi cance of the Black Hills,  will fi nd material they can use to support their denial. Those supporting the La- kota claim, especially those centered on the US violations of the 1868 treaty, will  also fi nd this volume useful. Impassioned advocates on each side of the issue  will have to contend with this work. Perhaps, in the fi nal analysis, it is this bal- ance that speaks most clearly of Ostler’s accomplishments in the book. Kerstin Knopf. Decolonizing the Lens of Power: Indigenous Films in  North America. Amsterdam: Editions Rodopi BV, 2008. 494 pp.  Cloth, $168.00. Brook Colley, University of California, Davis Kerstin Knopf ’s book Decolonizing the Lens of Power: Indigenous Films in North  America focuses on Native American and First Nations fi lms and fi lmmakers as  they create what she calls an “answering discourse” to the media-validated colo- nial discourse. Knopf samples a variety of Native American fi lmmaking genres,  Book Reviews 611 </page> <page sequence="4"> including documentary, short fi lms, and full-length narrative fi lms, providing  a detailed synopsis and content analysis of several fi lms. Since its genesis in the  early 1900s, fi lm has been an effective colonizing tool, impacting Indigenous  peoples around the globe. Films varied from ethnographic documentaries de- picting “exotic” and “vanishing” tribes to Hollywood narrative cinema depicting  Natives as a savage race that must be exterminated or subdued to make room for  Christian civilization. Like many forms of media, fi lm has been used by those  with power to generate propaganda, manufacture stereotypes, foster racism, and  create in the popular imagination widely accepted justifi cations for genocide,  land theft, and other forms of oppression. Both Canada and the United States  have used state-sponsored fi lms to legitimate their settler governments and land  claims within their borders. As fi lmmaking became an accessible visual art form  for Native American and First Nations peoples, it became a medium and tool  used to express creativity, educate, and advocate for change. Decolonizing the Lens of Power is divided into fi ve chapters. In the fi rst chap- ter Knopf introduces the “lens of power,” referring to the Foucauldian con- cept in which a collective group imbued with power directs an observing and  objectifying “gaze” toward the oppressed, which the oppressed then internal- ize. Knopf draws parallels between Foucault’s lens with the cinematic camera  lens, using the concept to analyze the magnifi ed gaze produced by colonial fi lm  discourse. Indigenous fi lmmakers and fi lms answer back to the colonizing dis- course by employing anticolonial strategies such as Gerald Vizenor’s “trickster  discourse,” playing with popular culture Indian imagery while challenging these  images in ways that give both the colonizer and the colonized the chance to be  liberated and healed. In chapter 2 Knopf constructs her postcolonial theoretical foundations and  what she identifi es as postcolonial conditions that Native American fi lms and  fi lmmakers respond to and contest. Despite the fact that Native peoples and na- tions have now used fi lm as a decolonizing mechanism for several generations,  Knopf continues to ground fi lm as an essentially Western-colonial tool. Like- wise, even though she acknowledges cultural transformation and continuance,  Knopf argues that there cannot be any pure or authentic Native form of expres- sion, by which she seems to mean that Native Americans today are not Native in  the way their precontact ancestors were Native, situating Indigenous fi lmmak- ers and fi lms in a hybrid space. Though Knopf shows awareness of critiques of  postcolonial and hybridist theories, she continues with a line of argument that  runs the danger of relegating Native fi lmmakers to mere crossbreeds of more  authentic forms of creative expression. Knopf does not seem to acknowledge the  difference between transculturation and hybridity or the transformative process  by which all peoples change over time, responding creatively to new situations  as they claim new tools, languages, and technologies as their own. To state it  612 american indian quarterly/fall 2011/vol. 35, no. 4 </page> <page sequence="5"> another way, we are all infl uenced by the cultures that surround us. The camera  should be understood as an Indigenous tool and fi lm as an Indigenous form of  expression, not merely an appropriated medium that belongs to the West. Knopf ’s theoretical framework misses some of the key concepts, texts, and  scholars that constitute part of the decolonizing discourse in Native American/ Indigenous studies. Though Knopf briefl y mentions Santa Clara Pueblo fi lm- maker Beverly Singer’s book Wiping the War Paint off the Lens, she fails to en- gage with Muskogee/Creek artist and scholar Hulleah Tsinhnahjinnie’s concept  of visual sovereignty. Furthermore, Knopf ’s work would have benefi ted greatly  by engaging with Maori scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith’s seminal work Decoloniz- ing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples. Smiths’s concept of an “In- digenous Research Agenda” might have helped Knopf develop a research proj- ect in which she worked with Indigenous fi lmmakers, creating space for tribal  voices to lead her inquiry. In Decolonizing the Lens of Power, Indigenous fi lm- makers are clearly positioned as subjects of, as opposed to collaborators with,  Knopf ’s project. As a practitioner of Indigenous studies might expect, the book devotes a  chapter to Indigenous oral traditions and how they are or are not incorporated  into Indigenous fi lms. In chapter 3 Knopf provides transcripts from interviews  with Native American and First Nations fi lmmakers that specifi cally and nar- rowly address their perceptions of oral traditions and issues of translatability to  fi lm. Quite obviously, storytelling represents an important element in all cin- ematic endeavors, Indigenous or not, yet Knopf dwells on analyzing whether  Native fi lmmakers have attempted to infuse their fi lms with components of oral  traditions, including rhythm, pace, style, and moods that refl ect these traditions.  A valuable part of this chapter includes the interviews with Native fi lmmak- ers Shelley Niro (Mohawk), Victor Masayesva (Hopi), and Alanis Obomsawin  (Abenaki), to name a few. The fi lmmakers themselves raise some interesting is- sues. For example, Obomsawin points to a need for fi lms and videos produced  with Native children in mind, as this medium can give young people a chance to  hear community stories and learn tribal epistemologies. This proposes a topic  that warrants further investigation. In chapters 4 and 5 Knopf focuses on short fi lms and dramatic fi lms, respec- tively. She applies classical fi lm theory to Indigenous fi lms while attempting to  tease out decolonizing strategies that Indigenous fi lmmakers employ. For ex- ample, Knopf asserts that fi lmmaker Lloyd Martell (Cree) in his 1996 short fi lm  Talker, uses fi lm to preserve oral traditions through a “modern, technologized  Indigenous storytelling” (186), while Shelley Niro (Mohawk) and Dan Bigbee  Jr. (Comanche) in their short fi lm Overweight with Crooked Teeth use mockery  as subversion to dismantle stereotypes and force the audience to confront their  own colonized thinking. From the dramatic fi lms, Knopf samples from works  Book Reviews 613 </page> <page sequence="6"> such as Honey Moccasin, Smoke Signals, the miniseries Big Bear, and Atanarjuat:  The Fast Runner. These fi lms have multifaceted goals drawing from contem- porary and historical Indigenous issues and mythologies, dealing with issues  ranging from gender, sexuality, justice, and the intersectionality of identities to  moral codes, the Hollywood Indian image, stereotypes, boarding schools, and  anticolonial fi lm sovereignty. While Knopf ’s analysis includes provocative ideas  concerning the decolonizing process engaged with by Native fi lmmakers, she  does not entirely follow through with several of the book’s more intriguing av- enues. Instead of developing an Indigenous fi lm theory in collaboration with  Indigenous fi lmmakers, Knopf continues to apply classical climatic theory to  Indigenous fi lms, trying to fi t the works and the fi lmmakers themselves into  a framework that appears to be more comfortable for Knopf, regardless of the  awkwardness or inappropriateness of the fi t. Decolonizing the Lens of Power is not necessarily a decolonizing text. Knopf ’s  archive and inquiry offer a unique opportunity to develop and engage with a  wide range of Indigenous epistemologies, collaborative strategies, and method- ological and theoretical approaches used by Native American and First Nations  peoples. However, she relies heavily on preexisting anticolonial academic dis- course and theory to develop her project. Knopf ’s interest seems to lie in analyz- ing the short fi lms and feature fi lms through classical fi lm theory rather than  work with Indigenous fi lmmakers to develop Indigenous fi lm theories. By pro- ducing this kind of scholarship, Knopf fetishizes the fi nalized fi lm product and  narrowly defi nes the strategies, goals, and process of Indigenous fi lmmakers.  Most importantly, Knopf ’s book constitutes a challenge to Indigenous studies  practitioners and Indigenous fi lmmakers to continue to develop their own criti- cal body of work that addresses Indigenous fi lms and creates Indigenous theo- ries of fi lm and fi lmmaking. Further projects might explore how Indigenous  fi lmmakers approach decolonizing themselves and their communities through  their fi lms and the fi lmmaking process. Jean M. O’Brien. Firsting and Lasting: Writing Indians out of Existence  in New England. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2010.  269 pp. Paper, $25.00. Darren J. Ranco, University of Maine Jean M. O’Brien’s new book, Firsting and Lasting: Writing Indians out of Exis- tence in New England, is a truly valuable contribution not only to American In- dian history but to our understanding of historical constructions about Indians  in(side) and out(side) of American history. Drawing on more than six hundred local histories from Massachusetts, Con- 614 american indian quarterly/fall 2011/vol. 35, no. 4 </page> <page sequence="7"> necticut, and Rhode Island written between 1820 and 1880 as well as censuses,  monuments, and accounts of historical pageants and commemorations, O’Brien  demonstrates the ways in which non-Indian New Englanders wrote and memo- rialized Indians into extinction, even though they were often active members of  the towns that offi cially claimed their extinction in the many semioffi cial histo- ries she examines. The sheer volume of histories and other sources consulted in  the book cannot be praised enough—O’Brien has performed almost an intel- lectual miracle in fi nding and discerning these sources for us. As O’Brien points out in the introduction, the aim of the book is to “under- stand how non-Indians in southern New England convinced themselves that In- dians there had become extinct even though they remained as Indian peoples— and do so to this day” (xii). To explore this, she organizes the book around three  themes that emerge from the rhetorical strategies of these local histories to void  New England of its Indian presence: “fi rsting,” “replacing,” and “lasting.” A fi nal  theme, “resisting,” emerges as a way to capture the seeming contradictions of In- dian presence in these histories, which seem so eager to erase Indians otherwise. It is worth noting that the period of local histories she examines is somewhat  of a boon in the writing of this kind of history for technological and ideologi- cal reasons and includes both the US centennial and the bicentennial of King  Philip’s War, both of which occurred in 1876. Why does she focus on south- ern New England? It was there that amateur historians, poets, and creators of  monuments “made the boldest claims to ‘fi rsting’ . . . that in essence asserts that  non-Indians were the fi rst people to erect institutions of a social order worthy  of notice” (xii). It is from these claims—that settler institutions were the “fi rst” real institu- tions on the landscape of southern New England—that chapter 1 gets its title,  “Firsting.” For example, in Judge Joseph Story’s centennial oration on the fi rst  settlement of Salem, Massachusetts, the logic of New England fi rsts can be eas- ily discerned: “By their [Indians’] every nature and character they can neither  unite themselves with civil institutions, nor with safety be allowed to remain as  distinct communities. . . . A wilderness is essential to their habits and pursuits”  (49–50). From the very beginning, therefore, Indian fi rsts had to be replaced by  American fi rsts, which created the “correct” kinds of civil institutions. Chapter 2, “Replacing,” focuses on the monuments erected to both Indian  and non-Indian places, which “collectively argue for the justice of the replace- ment of ancient Indians by modern New Englanders” (57). For example, in an  1878 history of Westerly, Rhode Island, the author points out: “Since the red  men failed to fulfi ll the commission given to mankind to subdue and cultivate  the earth . . . Providence determined to supplant them. . . . [T]he expulsion and  replanting have been rapidly progressing and are nearly accomplished” (82–83).  Here, we see the narrative of fi rsting progress to the point where it is “nearly ac- complished”—its completion will come only when Indians are extinct! Book Reviews 615 </page> <page sequence="8"> Chapter 3, “Lasting,” looks at the rhetorical strategies used in local histories  that assert the claim that “Indians can never be modern” (107). O’Brien does an  exceptional job bringing together ideas about race, blood, and culture that fu- eled singling out particular Indians as the last of their kind, often avoiding the  presence of their children and grandchildren at commemoration events. For ex- ample, after enumerating 120 Narragansetts as laborers and basket makers with  a tribal government in place, a history of Westerly (now called Charlestown),  Rhode Island, points to one woman as the last of her kind: “The blood of this  royal race fl ows now only through the veins of one living person—Esther, an old  woman in Westerly, living apart from her people, the only representative of the  ancient Narragansett chiefs, and though not quite of the pure blood, the purest  living of the Narragansett tribe” (110). Here we see the logics of race and mo- dernity that foreclose on Indians in southern New England—as Indian blood is  “diminished” and Indians change with the times, marking the fi nal embodiment  of an Indian nation secures the racial and cultural claims of New Englanders. In her research for the book, O’Brien was able to fi nd some of the juiciest  colonial recitations on the logics that underpin these local histories and Indian  erasure. In an 1847 history of Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, she fi nds the follow- ing declaration: “The white man can . . . become an Indian, not only in habit  and conduct, but even in nature. On the other hand, civilization is death to the  Indian. If he could be civilized, he would, when it were done, be an Indian no  longer, and when he ceases to be an Indian, he ceases to live” (119). This type of  revealing statement on the racial order of the times is probably not new to many  readers of American Indian history, but this kind of reveal exists on almost ev- ery page of O’Brien’s text and shows how committed these local historians were  to write Indians out of the present so they could claim the future for themselves. Chapter 4, “Resisting,” focuses on the contradictions, often found in the same  local history, regarding the extinction of Indians and their opaque presence on  the landscape of southern New England. In this chapter O’Brien explores the  colonial challenge faced by the narrators of these local histories: to use a nar- rative of extinction driven by notions of race and modernity that leave Indians  as part of the past but whose actual presence continues to serve as a sad lesson  about the failures of race and modernity. She also examines the work of Wil- liam Apess in this chapter as a clear Indian voice that resists the ideologies and  rhetorical strategies that drive the erasures in the hundreds of works she con- sults in the book. This part of the book seems slightly out of place—the obvious  strength of the book is the synthesis of all these sources that write Indians out of  existence, and bringing up Apess made me want more Indian voices in the book,  even though that is clearly not what it is about. O’Brien’s conclusion makes strong linkages between the narrative strategies  in these nineteenth-century histories and the struggle for federal recognition by  616 american indian quarterly/fall 2011/vol. 35, no. 4 </page> <page sequence="9"> tribal nations in southern New England, wherein tribes “are forced to rely on  a record that sought to make them disappear in order to prove their survival”  (206). Overall, Firsting and Lasting is a remarkable accomplishment. N. Scott Momaday. In the Bear’s House. Albuquerque: University of New  Mexico Press, 2010. 96 pp. Cloth, $24.95. Michael Snyder, Oklahoma City Community College N. Scott Momaday is the unequivocal elder statesman of Native American lit- erature. With over a dozen books under his belt, he is given credit for kick- ing off the so-called Native American Renaissance with the publication of his  debut novel, House Made of Dawn, in 1968, winning the Pulitzer the following  year. Momaday’s father was a Kiowa artist and his mother a crossblood Chero- kee teacher. Kiowa traditional stories and culture have always been a prodigious  infl uence upon his work and self-concept, along with that of the Pueblos and  Navajos that he absorbed while he and his parents lived on southwestern Indian  reservations. In the Bear’s House includes ten dramatic dialogues between God (Yahweh)  and Bear (Urset), nineteen poems, and two prose pieces Momaday calls “Pas- sages,” all of which involve Bear in one way or another. Amongst the literary  pieces are striking and evocative illustrations produced by Momaday himself.  Though slim, the book is an oversized treat for the eyes and will appeal to read- ers both young and old. It will also appeal to both scholars of Native American  literature and more casual interested readers. With a newly designed dust jacket,  visionary ursine art, a gorgeous layout with plenty of white space, and an at- tractive binding, the book is a beautiful object in itself. Along the way, Moma- day deals with the power of words and storytelling: Kiowa traditional stories,  the difference between oral and written narratives, and the mythical aspects of  common subjects such as the sport of baseball. He also explores prayer, dreams,  food, and other topics that have broad cross-cultural appeal. Throughout his career, Momaday has consistently engaged the fi gure of Bear.  Fascinated with Kiowa Bear stories, Momaday makes them a crucial part of his  Kiowa self-imagining and his vision of himself as a writer. Bear emerges in Mo- maday’s works of autobiography, poetry, and fi ction. Momaday’s Kiowa name,  Tsoai-talee, means Rock-Tree Boy and refers to the Kiowa story of a boy who  changes into a bear. In his transmogrifi cation the boy terrifi es his sisters, who  are able to ascend a rising tree and escape brother-bear. The stump of this tree  is what European American settlers would later call Devil’s Tower in Wyoming.  “Through the power of stories and names, I am the reincarnation of that boy,”  Momaday writes in his introduction to In the Bear’s House. Momaday tells this  Book Reviews 617 </page> <page sequence="10"> story again in the prose narrative “The Transformation,” collected here. For  Momaday, Bear is a representative of wilderness and nature, but so much more.  He is a healing fi gure who negotiates the human and bear worlds. He is a liminal  fi gure who is anthropomorphic yet radically other. Momaday identifi es with the  bear and seems to have experienced becoming the bear; such shape-shifting,  rooted in tribal storytelling, is a familiar trope throughout his work. In The An- cient Child, a novel published in 1989, the same year of the original publication  of In the Bear’s House, Momaday created a protagonist named Set (short for  Locke Setman), the Kiowa word for Bear, who fi guratively becomes a bear. In  Bear’s House he names his mythical Bear Urset, or the Ur-Bear, Original Bear.  Fittingly, Urset is also a writer who forms inscriptions with his sharp claws. The poetry section might be the strongest area, inaugurated by Momaday’s  signature poem “The Bear,” a lambent work that has been reprinted several  times since its composition in 1963. “The Blind Astrologers,” written in 1994, is  a profound and atmospheric poem that closes: “When they take their leave they  fade / through planes and prisms of rain” (61). On the same theme, “Ursa Ma- jor” (1995) is a perfect stellar poem of three quatrains that forms a brief conver- sation between the speaker and God. The poetry seems more carefully crafted  and is more aesthetically pleasing than the lesser dialogues. The dialogues between Yahweh and Urset are on the whole enjoyable but  somewhat uneven. At their best they are profound and oracular, at their worst  they are philosophically muddy and self-indulgent. Some amazing prose is  found here, such as Yahweh’s prayer in a story of the same name. “I pray that you  hold easily in your hands the balance of the earth and sky, that you laugh and  cry, know freedom and restraint, some joy and some sorrow, pleasure and pain,  much of life and a little of death,” Yahweh prays for Urset (15). On the other  hand, given the context, there is something irritating about Momaday’s having  God say, in reference to writer’s block: “Everyone who writes, even if it’s only  an entry in one’s diary, a letter, a high-school book report, encounters it” (41).  Moreover, some of the theology or cosmology herein seems muddled, blending  as it does Indigenous, Judeo-Christian, and personal mythologies. In light of debates over tribal nationalism versus cosmopolitanism, it is in- teresting that Momaday makes no political statement or gestures of exclusion.  The book is intensely introverted in some ways and does not attempt to engage  debates over identity or authenticity. In a meditation on writing in the form of  dialogue between God and Bear, oddly, no Indigenous or non-Western authors  are mentioned. Rather, Momaday has Yahweh wax ecstatic over the illuminating  power of Shakespeare, Dante, Cervantes, Melville, Joyce, and Dickinson. While  some critics have diminished the infl uence of European and American literature  upon Native American authors, Momaday has never done this and has even re- jected the label of “Indian writer” in the past. In his exploration of the mythos of  618 american indian quarterly/fall 2011/vol. 35, no. 4 </page> <page sequence="11"> baseball, we also feel the deep infl uence of American tropes and culture. Base- ball is indigenized, however, through the idea of Urset forming a team—the  Cubs, of course. Yet in this section, Momaday’s Yahweh cites Michael Jordan and  Edwin Moses but, again, fails to mention Jim Thorpe or any American Indian  (fi tting for a book centering on an animal fi gure, Secretariat is also lauded). It  is not clear why Momaday leaves out American Indian authors and athletes or  whether he was conscious of doing so, but it is obvious that in these instances,  he is not attempting to privilege Native American contributions, even within a  Kiowa narrative context. Yet despite these odd moments, the book as a whole is saturated with rein- scriptions of traditional Kiowa stories and an Indigenous view that stresses the  continuity between the animal and human worlds. The collection will therefore  also be of great interest to the fi eld of critical animal studies along with Ameri- can Indian literary studies. Storytelling and ceremony are central. While we may  lament the death of Bear by a hunter’s gun, “sooner or later the singer would  come, and everything would have its place in the relief of ritual,” as Momaday  concludes “Notes on a Hunting Scene.” Scott Richard Lyons. X-Marks: Native Signatures of Assent. Minneapolis:  University of Minnesota Press, 2010. 240 pp. Paper, $22.50. Melanie K. Yazzie, University of New Mexico In X-Marks Scott Richard Lyons adds a timely and important optic to debates  about contemporary Indian identity. Drawing from Ojibwe histories of migra- tion, Lyons offers the x-mark as a metaphor for modern Indigenous identities  formed in movement. Crystallized in the initial documents of modern con- tact—treaties—x-marks are Native assents to the new evidence of a commit- ment to the future welfare of a people contending with colonialism across vary- ing and often contradictory times, spaces, and discourses. As Lyons poignantly  articulates, x-marks are defi nitions of Indigenous identity that “would keep ‘In- dians’ viable for at least seven generations, strengthen existing communities, en- hance our political independence, and provide the greatest degree of happiness  for the greatest number of Indians” (50). As a distinctly historicist hermeneutic that privileges the diversity that an  “identities in movement” defi nition implies, the x-mark categorically challenges  the ahistoricism and biological essentialism that underwrite much of popular  traditionalist discourses on identity, culture, nationalism, and citizenship. Each  of the book’s chapters is framed by the intersection of these four areas with  traditionalism. In the fi rst chapter Lyons begins with a brief review of Indian  identity controversies over ethnic fraud, disenrollment, and banishment, argu- Book Reviews 619 </page> <page sequence="12"> ing that these public spectacles reveal a larger crisis of identity whose uncer- tainty and contestability frame the possibilities of x-marks. Traditionalist aca- demic studies like Eva Marie Garroutte’s Real Indians: Identity and the Survival  of Native America (2003) are critiqued in this section for offering correctives to  this crisis that extend a view of blood essentialism. For Lyons, the crisis itself is  not the problem; rather, the problem resides in essentialist misinterpretations  of tradition like Garroutte’s that prescribe identities rather than describe how  they are formed and negotiated. Calling this a difference between “being” and  “doing,” Lyons makes a compelling case for descriptive understandings of tradi- tion by analyzing Ojibwemowin (the Ojibwe language) equivalents to “doing,”  which describe identity according to certain behaviors, actions, and movements  through time and space. Although the author’s treatment of Garroutte’s ideas about kinship are, at  times, a bit heavy-handed, he convincingly demonstrates how questions of be- ing like “Who is an Indian?” foreclose the realities of x-mark identities that are  constructed through movement and negotiation with colonial power structures.  In the next chapter Lyons extends his critique of Garroutte in his discussion of  traditionalist “culture cops” like Indigenous intellectuals and community elites  who police the boundaries of being in order to maintain certain cultural forms  of authenticity. This is epistemologically repugnant for Lyons, for another quick  review of Ojibwemowin descriptions of culture similarly reveals a traditional  proclivity for assenting to the new as a means to produce and sustain more, not  less, life. Preoccupied with delimiting belonging according to the authenticist  mantle of being, culture cops engage in a highly essentialist practice of “reactive  self-perception” that ends up reinforcing the problematic philosophies of Oth- erness that colonial discourses of authenticity perform.1 Throughout the remainder of the book Lyons depends on the paradigm of  reactive self-perception to characterize traditionalists of all stripes. Perhaps not  coincidentally, such a notion closely resembles Gerald Vizenor’s well-known  trope of victimry. Indeed, many of Vizenor’s ideas regarding identity, as well as  literary critic Arnold Krupat’s contested notion of Indigenous cosmopolitan- ism, directly frame Lyons’s x-mark thesis. Although at times overcelebratory,  Lyons’s use of Vizenor is refreshing when one considers the strident and often- times incorrect critiques of Vizenor’s work that have offset nationalist frame- works developed within American Indian studies over the last decade. In this  regard, scholars of Indigenous nationalism can especially appreciate the in- corporation of Vizenor’s classic ideas about survivance into an interesting and  original defi nition of Indigenous nationalism. In the book’s third chapter Lyons  critiques American Indian intellectual history—and the works of preeminent  nationalist scholar Taiaiake Alfred in particular—to propose a vision of nation- alism that embraces the new through “a modernization of the ethnie” (120).  Distinct from Alfred’s articulations of cultural resistance that reject moderniza- 620 american indian quarterly/fall 2011/vol. 35, no. 4 </page> <page sequence="13"> tion—ideas that resemble the separatist politics of historical fi gures like Tecum- seh and Popé—Indigenous nationalism develops the preexisting heritages and  traditions of tribal ethnie to determine the legal and culturally protective func- tions of sovereignty within a modern context. Interested in the kind of produc- tion and sustainment of traditional culture that Ojibwemowin culture words  describe, those who placed their x-mark on treaties irrevocably linked national- ism to expansive notions of survivance. Because of this link, nationalism cannot,  as Lyons argues, be based on the kind of conceptual separatism that underwrites  much of Alfred’s political philosophy. Nor can literary criticism adopt a herme- neutic of separatism that, from the vantage point of the x-mark, would mean  the end—not the continuation—of tribal communities. The fi nal chapter is concerned with how the x-mark of citizenship within this  defi nition of nationalism has the potential to resolve the perennial crisis of being  that has invigorated traditionalist Indian identity debates. More of a meditation  on possibilities than a resolution to such debates, this chapter focuses on how a  decolonized form of citizenship might secure Indigenous sovereignty by requir- ing criteria that produce the kinds of members who would participate according  to traditional values set forth in tribal ethnie. Rather than relying on untenable  and essentialist criteria like blood quantum and kinship, Lyons offers tripartite  criteria for determining national belonging. Calling these criteria “hierarchies  of membership,” the author suggests that citizenship be delineated according to  three categories—citizens, nationals, and lineal descendants—that are implic- itly based on participation guidelines derived from a nation’s ethnie. For Lyons,  such an approach to citizenship becomes a productive site for creating new and  potentially transgressive x-marks, for it produces meaningful nationalisms pre- mised on various practices of doing rather than performances of being. Indeed,  as he repeatedly contends throughout, “require what you want to produce.” Although Lyons tends to oversimplify the traditionalist perspective—a limi- tation of the book that is perhaps symptomatic of the polemic that strict bi- naries like essentialism and antiessentialism inevitably engender—his analysis  generally offers a rich platform for future studies of the complexities of Indig- enous identity. Arguably, no segment of the fi eld has grappled more with these  complexities than Lyons’s own area of specialization, American Indian literary  criticism. However, I imagine that works emanating from Indigenous feminism,  queer theory, and violence and genocide studies, among many others, have  much to offer by way of making their own x-marks. note 1.
