<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Study of Shakespearian Tragedy since Bradley HERBERT WEISINGER NTIL recently, Bradley's analysis of the nature of Shake- spearian tragedy has been substantially accepted as funda- iJ imental to our understanding of the tragic pattern in the plays. Something of the excited approval with which Bradley was * p first accepted has been described by one of his severest latter- day critics; in her article, "Bradley Revisited: Forty Years After,' Professor Lily Bess Campbell has recalled the enthusiasm with which critics and teachers alike greeted the appearance of Bradley's study. And it was no wonder that he should have been given so hearty a response, for if we glance at the state of Shakespearian study in the twenty years or so preceding the publication of his book we can see how great an advance he made in the analysis of Shakespeare's tragedies and to what a high level he lifted Shakespearian criticism. However, just as Bradley's learning and critical depth put an end to nine- teenth-century didactic, impressionistic, and romantic interpretations of Shake- speare's tragedies, so now a number of developments in modern criticism and scholarship have tended in turn to undermine his labors. These are, first, the emphasis on text instead of idea, characteristic of the new criticism; second, the effect of studies of imagery; third, the reading of Shakespeare's characters in the light of Elizabethan psychology; fourth, the emphasis on native medieval ele- ments in Elizabethan drama; fifth, the semantic revolt against generic terms; and sixth, the assertion of the impossibility of the creation of tragedy at all. The cumulative direct force of the first five of these approaches, plus the indirect influence of the sixth, has brought about a general disparagement of Bradley's point of view and a corresponding lack of interest in the idea of tragedy and its applications. The most formidable of these approaches is the application of -the methods of the new criticism to Shakespeare's plays. By asserting the unique integrity of a work of art, ". . . a pattern of resolutions and balances and harmonizations, developed through a temporal scheme",2 as Professor Cleanth Brooks puts it, the new criticism effectively cuts off from the consideration of a piece of litera- ture all matters which are not immediately intrinsic to it. More important, how- ever, is the denial of the element of judgment in the new criticism. It is sig- 1Lily B.

More- over, Dr. I. A. Richards' notion of the therapeutic value of poetry, phrased as it is in technical psychological terms, is either too specific for use on any scale, or, if it says what I suspect it to mean, places him in the very camp which he is at some pains to oppose. And the best that Professor Brooks can do is, by amplifying a suggestion of Dr. Richards', to suggest a kind of scale for determining the value of poetry. Low in the scales one would find a rather simple poetry in which the associations of the vari- ous elements that go to make up the poem are similar in tone and therefore can be unified under one rather simple attitude-poems of simple affection, positive, "external" satires, etc. Higher in the scale, one would find poerns in which the variety and clash among the elements to be comprehended under a total attitude are sharper. In tragedy, where the clash is at its sharpest- where the tension between attraction and repulsion is most powerful-one would probably find the highest point in the scale. (Pp. 229-230.) The effect of such a procedure is to utilize criteria ". . . in terms of the organiza- tions of the poems themselves-not by having to appeal to some outside scale of values." But such a statement is either too narrow and personal to be of any widely significant application or says in a rather specialized and tortured way what most ethical critics, Arnold, for example, would normally accept. At bottom, despite its sophistication, the new criticism rests on a postulate in theory which it must violate in action. This is the notion that the best reader of a poem is he who comes to it with a tabula rasa which prevents him from reading into the poem what is presumably not there. Unfortunately, his first reading must of necessity be his last since by that very act he has acquired too much knowledge. Ironically, it is amusing to note that two of the most important lyrics of our times, Eliot's Waste Land and Auden's Christmas Eve Le'ter, have been published with notes and explanations by the authors themselves, a clear violation of the doctrine of aesthetic self-conitainedness. Actually, one of the most stimulating things about the new criticism is the brilliant use it has nmide of insights outside the works themselves, that is, the implications of Frazer, Freud, and the recent students of language, such as Urban and Langer. The truth seems to be that when the new method is strictly applied to a work of the magnitude of the Divine Comedy or Macbeth, it is simply wanting in the requisite range of applicability. Nor, as he himself admits, does Professor Brooks' analysis of the clothed daggers and naked babe images in Malcbeth tell us by any means the whole of the meaning of Macbeth. Finally, for all the strictures he heaped on Bradley's discussion of Macbeth, Mr. L. C. Knights finally manages to say pretty much the same thing abour the play that Bradlkey does, and in words not very different from Bradley's.3 If the new criticism suffers from a kind of aesthetic primitivism, studies of imagery suffer from a kind of tautology. Miss Spurgeon and the others who have followed her have gone to great and useful pains to catalogue the images 3 The parallel passages are nicely brought together by Paul N. Siegel, "In Defense of Bradley" College English, IX (1948), pp. 251-252.</page><page sequence="3">THE STUDY OF SHAKESPEARIAN TRAGEDY SINCE BRADLEY 389 Shakespeare used in his plays as evidence of his intent and have discovered that, in every case, the images used have matched that intent. That this method has resulted in many fresh insights into Shakespeare's methods of composition there is no doubt, particularly in the very subtle and revealing analyses by Mr. Edward A. Armstrong, who has applied recent discoveries in the study of the processes of word association to recreate what must be very close to Shakespeare's "sub- conscious and subliminal" methods of imagery making. Mr. Armstrong has an illuminating description of the probable method of imagery formation in Shake- speare;4 but when the imagery method gets out of hand, when, for example, Miss Spurgeon writes: In the case of a poet, I suggest it is chiefly through his images that he, to some extent unconsciously, "gives himself away", . . . the poet unwittingly lays bare his own innermost likes and dislikes, observations and interests, associations of thought, attitudes of mind and beliefs, in and through the images . . .5 and then proceeds to make him out verily a Victorian poet in mind and body: ". . . Healthy in body as in mind, clean and fastidious", or when Mr. Armstrong suggests that he disliked both painted women and dogs, then the legitimate boundaries of investigation have indeed been crossed. But studies of imagery can tell us only how Shakespeare's mind worked; they have not been able to tell us the significance of the results of that working, that is, the patterns of action and meaning which the combinations of images ultimately constitute. There is, for example, nothing in the previous pages of Professor Brooks' analysis of the imagery of Macbeth which prepares us for such a statement as: ...Macbeth is thus caught between the irrational and the rational.... Macbeth in his general concern for the future is typical-is Every Man. He becomes the typical tragic protagonist when he yields to pride and hybr-is. (P. 4I.) These are statements plainly derived from a study of the play which far tran- scends analysis of imagery and must be judged in terms of a larger concept of tragedy than the imagery method affords. Nor is Mr. Armstrong's notion that in Shakespeare's ...imagination the ideas Life and Death were supreme. . . . There are certain other important contrasting images of almost equal relevance to Life and Death intimately connected with them and constantly like them, set in opposition, such as Love and Hate, Light and Darkness. (P. 44; see also pp. 93-99.) particularly more helpful since these antitheses are at once too narrow and too large to be of much guidance in the interpretation of the tragic pattern in Shake- speare. But it is after all no wonder that the images match the intent for the simple reason that the play is conveyed to us through poetry, that is to say, through the succession of images proper to the experiences being conveyed. 4Shakespeare's Imagination, A Study of the Psychology of Association and Inspiration (Lon- don, 1946), p. 41. 5 Caroline F.

As a matter of fact, Bradley was not at all unaware of the use of imagery analysis, as witness his treatment of the animal imagery in Lear. But he recognized that imagery study is not an end in itself; his concern was properly with the patterns of motifs and ideas created by the use of the imagery pertinent to the patterns.6 More determined, however, is the attack on Bradley's scholarship by Pro- fessor Campbell. If in her book the criticism of Bradley was implicit, in her article she has quite openly stated that Bradley's ignorance of Elizabethan psy- chology and philosophy vitiated his entire treatment of the tragedies. However, a number of unexamined assumptions have gone into her criticism, and it might be well to examine them here, since they underlie other scholarly repudiations of Bradley as well. In the first place, Professor Campbell seems to assume a kind of well-integrated and consistent Elizabethan psychology and philosophy which was known to all writers of the Renaissance, and which, in the second place, Shakespeare naturally used. But as Professor Louise C. Turner Forest has so well shown, Elizabethan psychology is in reality a creation of recent scholar- ship which has given a false unity to what was actually a number of contradictory and fragmentary psychologies and pseudo-psychologies.7 Moreover, the assump- tion that Shakespeare did in fact use them is impossible of proof; the most that Professor Campbell can show is that some Elizabethan psychologists said some things about some kinds of people which are something like what Shakespeare said of them. Furthermore, there is in Professor Campbell's method another assumption, one which is made by other Elizabethan scholars, too, which postulates that the extrapolation of an intellectual background is indeed that background which the particular writer being studied did in fact use. But out of the totality of experience which is possible to a man within his lifetime, only those aspects which seem significant to him and which fit his particular needs are the ones which he does use. To say that Bradley was ignorant of Elizabethan philosophy is to assume the existence of such a philosophy and, further, that Shakespeare employed it. But if there is one safe generalization about the Renaissance, it is that the number of philosophies it propounded was legion; the real question is which, if any, did Shakespeare actually use, or granting the existence of such use, is the problem rather not one of asking how Shakespeare used these ideas, what modifications did he make in them, that is, what is distinctively Shake- spearian, the unique quality which differentiates him from others, rather than of reducing him to the level of his contemporaries? Thus the effect of such studies as those of Professor John W. Draper is to make Shakespeare into a 6 On this matter, the first chapter of Professor V. E. Panofsky's Studies in Iconology (New York, I939), pp. 3-3I, is indispensable.

But there are further implications in Professor Campbell's method which lead us to the problem of the evaluation of the native medieval elements in Elizabethan tragedy. As a result of the reaction against Burckhardt's formula- tion of the Renaissance as sui generis, the gradual fusion of the Renaissance with the Middle Ages, a process expanded by the eighteenth-century historians on the basis of numerous Renaissance hints, has resulted in the virtual disap- pearance of the Renaissance as a distinctive era, and parallel with this develop- ment, has come the repudiation of the role of the revival of classical culture in the Renaissance and the substitution of a medieval world-view in its place. The onslaught against the Renaissance has been especially strong in the history of science under the leadership of Professor Lynn Thorndike, but it is no less wide- spread in the present study of Elizabethan literature, particularly the drama. The medieval world picture, as described by Professors Campbell, Farnham, and Till- yard-to name only a few-has been so completely merged with the Renaissance that both it and its classical heritage have been all but covered over. And so far as the idea of tragedy in particular is concerned, the trend culminates in the reading of Shakespeare as a kind of superior writer of medieval exernpla.9 As Professor Farnham puts it: The story of a fall from felicity into misfortune cast in the form which Boccaccio devised bore the name of tragedy down through the Middle Ages and even later. In Elizabethan England it bore the name without apology along with the newly born dramatic tragedy, and there is small evidence of anybody's critical concern that it should not do so.10 Thus, the medieval Fall of Princes theme has been studied in detail by recent scholars with the purpose of showing that Shakespearian tragedy is a natural outgrowth of native forces which have their origins deep in the Middle Ages (in fact, in late Roman culture, according to Professor Farnham) and which culminate in Elizabethan drama which in turn differs from its medieval fore- bears only in degree but not in kind."' Bradley had already recognized this relationship; in stating the more obvious characteristics of Shakespearian tragedy, he had pointed out that it dealt with the exceptional suffering and calamity of a conspicuous person which in their turn made the whole scene a scene of woe. These ideas, he said, ". . . would more than suffice to describe the whole tragic fact as it presented itself to the medieval mind", and he adduces Dante, Chaucer, and Boccaccio: "A total reverse of fortune, coming unawares upon a man who 8 Professor Samuel E. Chew has shown the futility of such source hunting in his article, "'This Strange Eventful History'," Joseph Quincy Adams Memorial Studies, pp. 157-A82, in which he works out, not the source for Jacques' Seven Ages speech, since it is clear that here are at once no specific parallel sources, but many uses of the idea with which Shakespeare's audience would be familiar and respond to; that is, they responded to the association of ideas and Shakespeare's particular treatment of them together, and not to their recognition of a source or Shakespeare's "originality" alone. 9 For example, see Lily Bess Campbell, Shakespeare's Tragic Heroes Slaves of Passion (Cam- bridge University Press, 1930), pp. 22, 37. 10 Willard Farnham, The Medieval Heritage of Elizabethan Tragedy (University of California Press, 1936), p. 71. 11 See, for example, Howard Baker, Induction to Tragedy (Louisiana State Press, r939), p. 2.</page><page sequence="6">392 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY 'stood in high degree', happy and apparently secure,-such was the tragic fact to the mediaeval mind." But he adds: "Shakespeare's idea of the tragic fact is larger than this idea and goes beyond it; but it includes it."'2 That Shakespearian tragedy includes the medieval theme of the fall of princes is without doubt true but that it goes beyond it is equally true, and much more significant. Theodore Spencer has suggested that for the Elizabethans tragedy was not "the imitation of an action . . . through pity and fear effecting the proper purga- tion of these emotions"; it was "merely a story that ended in death": And tragical, my noble lord, it is; For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.13 Thus he rejects both the Aristotelian view of tragedy and also the medieval fall of princes theme and insists rather on a conception of tragedy which is the out- come of the conflict between two views of man in which the pathos of the omnipresence of death, inevitably covering all, strikes the proper tragic tone. Tragedy, then, is the sad flowering of the Contempt of the World theme, in- herited from the Middle Ages, and given more anguished and more passionate utterance, and its effect is ultimately one of despair, the individual briefly light- ing the world with the flash of his ego, only to be buried in the darkness which encompasses us all.'4 Now, just as the so-called optimism of the Renaissance has had to be toned down by reference to its equally wide-spread pessimism, it is now necessary to insist again that the Renaissance cannot be characterized exclusively by medieval or modern; it is much too complex for such over simplified contraries. Again, the assertion of the nobility of man in the face of the overwhelming annihilation of both personality and ideals implicit in the expansion of the Contempt of the World theme is made groundless by the very terms of the theme itself; Professor Farnham sums up his conclusions by telling us that: "All that Shakespeare alone will permit us to say is that the yoke of life is hard but supremely worth the bearing in the interest of the general good" (p. 446). Thus stated, the assertion fails to do justice to the range of Shakespeare's thought and is self-contradictory as well. What seems to be happening here is that those who hold to the primary influence of the medieval fall of princes theme on Shake- spearian tragedy are reading it in the light of Stoicism, even though one of the major aims of their work is to repudiate the influence of Seneca on Elizabethan drama. Though Mr. Eliot expresses the hope that his essay will prevent the appear- ance of a Stoical or Senecan Shakespeare, nevertheless his prestige is such that the Stoical Shakespeare has been accepted by many critics and, for all the disclaimers, by Mr. Eliot himself. For in his account of "the penetration of Senecan sen- sibility", to use his phrase, he insists that "the attitude of self-dramatization assumed by some of Shakespeare's heroes at moments of tragic intensity,""15 an attitude characteristic of the Elizabethan dramatists as a whole, with the excep- 12 A.

But the best authority on the influence of Senecanism on the Renaissance drama, Professor H. B. Charlton, in his lectures on Shakespearian Tragedy, expressly delimits the role of the Roman conception of fate in its effect on tragedy, particularly as it had been modified by the six- teenth-century mind.16 In his previous study of the growth of the Senecan tradi- tion in Renaissance tragedy, Professor Charlton had already surveyed the dra- matic qualities of Seneca's tragedies, established the nature of their appeal to the Renaissance, demonstrated the greater importance of Latin tragedy over Greek tragedy in the Renaissance, and examined in detail the development of the Senecan tradition in Italy, France, and England."7 But is the Senecan influence an adequate explanation of Shakespearian tragedy? Is it, in fact, sufficient for Elizabethan tragedy as a whole? So far as the form of Elizabethan tragedy is concerned, we know that many of the formal elements attributed to the influence of Seneca are as much medieval in their origin as they are Roman. The five-act division of the play, the use of the chorus, the violation of the unities and of stage decencies, the employment of the messenger and of ghosts, the utilization of the revenge motive, the taste for rant, sensationalism, and sententious precepts, all these have their native medieval analogues and traditions.'8 But it is in the realm of ideas where the difference between Elizabethan, and particularly Shakespearian, tragedy and Senecan tragedy is at once most sharp and most significant. For Senecan tragedy is based on postulates which by their very nature cannot possibly result in the kind of tragedy which we find in Shakespeare. That Christianity absorbed much of Stoicism is more than obvious, especially in the case of Paul and Augustine, and in the development of political theory. But if Christianity enveloped Stoicism, it also changed it, and this change is indeed radical, and all the more so when it is considered in context with the Renaissance insistence on freedom within limita- tion of the moral agent. Stoicism is a philosophy of withdrawal, a rejection of the society of man, and a repudiation of the responsibility of man for man. Under such intellectual circumstances, the social basis of tragedy, tragedy as ritual, as a means of placing man in rapport with God and nature through the free struggle of man to attain understanding in his own way, through suffering passing from ignorance to knowledge by confronting evil directly and by actively overcoming it-in such circumstances tragedy must inevitably wither. For if the Elizabethans worked more closely within a medieval framework than perhaps Burckhardt was prepared to admit, it still remains true that classical attitudes and ideas were at least as familiar, if not more so, to them than were the medieval attitudes and ideas which are now being rediscovered. And if they took their medieval ways for granted, they consciously and deliberately in- terpreted them in the light of the revival of classical culture. The result of the combination was not the mere addition of two elements, but rather the creation of a new synthesis on a level higher than either taken by itself. That behind 16 H. B.

Charlton, "Introduction," The Poetical Works of Sir William Alexander (Edinburgh, I921), I, xvii-cc. 18 Howard Baker, pp. i06-153.</page><page sequence="8">394 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY Shakespeare there is indeed a medieval heritage of tragedy there is no doubt, but the measure of his artistry is not that he was absorbed and lost in that heritage but rather that he converted it to his own uses; he emphatically did not write yet another variation on The Mirror for Magistrates. For tragedy tran- scends mere exemplum; it is on a different and higher esthetic and ethical level."9 The current revolt against generic terms such as "Renaissance", "Romanti- cism", and "Classicism" has left us so fearful of them that it is not surprising that the suspicion of generalizations should be extended to the concept of tragedy as well. The result has been that while the critic has been permitted to speak of particular tragedies, he cannot any longer speak of tragedy in general; the parallel situation in regard to Romanticism comes of course immediately to mind. Yet it does not seem unreasonable to ask, whether if Romanticism is in fact a series of romanticisms, a series of romanticisms cannot be Romanti- cism, and the same is true of the concept of tragedy as well. It must be obvious, I think, that to accept the denial of the universality of tragedy is to leave criti- cism virtually impotent, for if only particular definitions of tragedy applicable only to particular ages or even more narrowly to particular plays are valid, then generalization as to the nature of art is made impossible, and criticism, which has traditionally proceeded by the method of comparison and contrast over the widest range of relevance, is rendered sterile. However, the most serious consequence of the reaction against generic terms is the undermining of the element of judgment in criticism. The effect of semanticism run wild is to shat- ter the integrity of the individual artist; and to separate his work into disparate and often contradictory ideas often yields as false a picture of his work as the equally extreme manufacture of a system out of his ideas when there is none; certainly, the extreme of the one is not the corrective to the extreme of the other. Likewise, the tracing of ideas as though they had an independent life of their own and obeyed the special laws of their own being which only accidentally happened to place them within the work of a writer results in a loss of a focal place from which to exercise judgment, especially since it is in the less important writers that the most typical expression of an idea will ordinarily be found; again, there is the danger of so completely merging the great writer in the flood of parallel expressions that his uniqueness is drowned out. Judgment is thus lost in history which should be instead the highest kind of judgment. It remains finally to assess the effect on the idea of tragedy of the theory that it is impossible, for sociological and ideological reasons, to write tragedy at this time. This theory rests on the valid principle that tragedy is ultimately optimistic in intent and needs an ethical view of the world on which to rest, but draws the false conclusion that no tragedy can be written because these condi- tions do not, and more important, cannot hold today. The effect of such ideas is to relegate the discussion of the idea of tragedy to an academic backwater, with- out the vital influence of the possibility of actual attainment to give the discus- sion point and purpose. Yet the frame of mind which Professor Joseph Wood Krutch has so well caught in his The Modern Temper is so widespread as to make the study of tragedy look almost exclusively to the past, when its purposes 19 See E. M. W. Tillyard, Five Poems I470-1870 (London, 1948), p. 40, for a correction of the point of view taken in The Elizabethan World Picture.</page><page sequence="9">THE STUDY OF SHAKESPEARIAN TRAGEDY SINCE BRADLEY 395 should be to establish a theoretical basis on which new tragedies can be written. Professor Krutch's argument stems from his insistence on the fundamental split between art and philosophy on the one hand and science on the other. If, he writes: . . .the world of poetry, mythology, and religion represents the world as a man would like to have it, while science represents the world as he gradually comes to discover it, we need only compare the two to realize how irrecon- cilable they appear. For the cozy bowl of the sky arched in a protecting curve above him he must exchange the cold immensities of space, and, for the spiritual order which he has designed, the chaos of nature. God he had loved because God was anthropomorphic, because He was made in man's own image, with the purposes and desires which were human and hence under- standable. But nature's purpose, if purpose she can be said to have, is no purpose of his and is not understandable in his terms. Her desire merely to live and to propagate in innumerable forms, her ruthless indifference to his values, and the blindness of her irresistible will strike terror to his soul, and he comes in the fullness of his experience to realize that the ends which he proposes to himself-happiness and order and reason-are ends which he must achieve, if he achieve them at all, in her despite. Formerly ho had believed in even his darkest moments that the universe was rational if he could only grasp its rationality, but gradually he comes to suspect that rationality is an attribute of himself alone and that there is no reason to suppose that his own life has any more meaning than the life of the hum- blest insect that crawls from one annihilation to another.20 But since tragedy can only arise when ". . . a people fully aware of the calamities of life is nevertheless serenely confident of the greatness of man" and is ". . . the triumph over despair and of confidence in the value of human life," ". . . a pro- fession of faith, and a sort of religion; a way of looking at life by virtue of which it is robbed of pain" (pp. I22, I23, I26), the effect of science has been to rob man of his dignity by ripping his faith in God and nature to shreds. The con- sequence is that it is only by the most painful effort of reconstruction that we can partially recreate the conditions which make the reading of tragedy somewhat possible, and as for the creation of tragedy itself, that is altogether impossible. But it seems to me that Professor Krutch's position is based on a misreading of the philosophical implications of science. In the first place, it is not at all certain to me that the picture of the universe which Professor Krutch attributes to science is correct. There is implied in his statement the notion that the new science of the Renaissance reduced man's stature in the universe and cut him irrevocably loose from his moorings in the orderly universe of the Middle Ages.21 But as Professor Lovejoy has shown in The Great Chain of Being, the place of man in the new picture of the universe as drawn by Renaissance science was on the contrary much higher and nobler than the Middle Ages had accorded him: 20 Joseph Wood Krutch, The Modern Temper (New York, 1929), pp. 8-9. There are many other expressions of this notion of nature's indifference to man in the literature of the '20's, notably by Bertrand Russell. 21 This idea has been advanced by Edwin A. Burtt, The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science (New York, 1927), pp. 4-6. The casting of the Renaissance in the role of intellectual villain has become a commonplace in modern theology; see, for example, Stanley R. Hopper, The Crisis of Faith (New York, 1944), pp. 46-139, where the rise of science, as the most important product of the Renaissance, is made to bear the brunt of having caused all our contemporary spiritual ills.</page><page sequence="10">396 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY as Professor Lovejoy writes, ". . . to remove man from the centre of things was to raise him from his low estate" (p. I48). In the second place, this reading of the history of science fails to recognize that so far as the early scientists themselves were concerned, the oppressive effects of science on man's place in the universe which Professor Krutch postulates were not regarded so pessimistically; and while they were recognized, as for example by the Cambridge Platonists, they were felt to be capable of being overcome by the other implications of science which promised man's control over nature and his emancipation from his bond- age to scarcity. Finally, I am not at all sure but that the so-called crisis in science is not so much a crisis in science itself as a crisis in the society in which science now happens to find itself. That is, it seems to me that the picture of the universe which science has drawn and the place to which it has assigned man is not so pessimistic or so fraught with terror as Professor Krutch would have one believe. But the crisis is rather the result of the clash between the bounty of science and a social structure which seeks to contain and stratify it; it is not a crisis in science itself, then, but in the control over the methods of making the results of science available. I do not therefore see that Professor Krutch's position is tenable on the terms in which he has stated it, and it is possible to draw quite opposite conclu- sions concerning the impact of science.22 Despite the trends which I have briefly characterized here, the kind of approach which Bradley represents still seems to me the most fruitful for the understanding of tragedy. However, I do not at all mean to suggest that we must forthwith return to him in his entirety for there is, after all, a lack in his work which must be supplied, a necessary correction which must be made, before his criticism can be employed in its proper perspective. I must indeed confess that Bradley often seems to proceed as though Shakespeare wrote with Aristotle by his side, and it is of course true that the Aristotle of the Renaissance is cer- tainly not the Aristotle we have, and more important, it is scarcely conceivable that Shakespeare deliberately set himself to write within the Aristotelian frame- work. But it still remains true that, tautological as it sounds, Shakespeare did write tragedies and that, as a consequence of the nature of tragedy in general, both Aristotelian theory and Greek practice are indeed germane to the considera- tion of what Shakespeare wrote, even assuming that he knew nothing at all of them. What is missing is a bridge, valid on esthetic, historical, and ideological grounds, which can link Athenian and Elizabethan tragedy together in such a way as to close the gap in Bradley's treatment. Such a link would have to fit the pattern of Athenian tragedy, retain its vitality in the Middle Ages, and appear again as central to Shakespearian tragedy. Moreover, it would have to include within itself the possibility of a valid parallel between the Greek idea of hybris and the Christian doctrine of sin; it would have to be able to create a pattern of tragic action applicable both to Sophocles and to Shakespeare; and it would have to be able to take into account the parallel dialectical transformation of Greek myth into Greek tragedy and of Christian exemplum into Elizabethan tragedy.
