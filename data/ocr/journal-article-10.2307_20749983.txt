<plain_text><page sequence="1">Effect of Recovery Efforts on Consumer Trust and Loyalty in E-Tail: A Contingency Model Cristiane Pizzutti and Daniel Fernandes ABSTRACT: Customer complaints are endemic in e-tail. How they are handled by the seller is vital to its recovery from the problem and its continuing success. Investigation of the mod erating roles of the contingency variables of familiarity quality of prior experiences, and failure types extends the theoretical framework of retailer recovery efforts to the on-line purchasing environment. Based on survey data from 3,206 on-line consumers, the study makes several significant findings: (1) the interactional aspects of an e-tailer's recovery efforts improve consumer perceptions of the recovery process; (2) recovery efforts are essential for building and maintaining long-lasting relationships with customers but do not affect their overall view of e-commerce; (3) a history of positive e-commerce experience will diminish the negative impact on consumer trust of a new purchasing experience with unsatisfactory complaint handling; (4) familiarity has a positive effect on the relationship between trust and loyalty and diminishes the effect on trust of dis/satisfaction with com plaint handling; and (5) conditional to the type of failure, dimensions of perceived fairness have variable impacts on consumer satisfaction with complaint handling. KEY WORDS AND PHRASES: Consumer trust, Internet purchasing, loyalty, recovery efforts. With the rapid growth of e-commerce has come a proportionate rise in the number of complaints by consumers about their on-line experiences [20]. One report indicates that one out every four transactions on the Internet ends with an unhappy customer [73]. Furthermore, via the Internet, consumers can now compare prices worldwide. With competitors just a mouse click away, consumer defection is a constant threat and perpetual concern [60]. This be ing the case, the effective recovery efforts of a company, or on-line seller, are essential for customer retention and e-business survival. Considerable empirical evidence from traditional retailing research sug gests that satisfactory complaint handling contributes positively to customer retention, loyalty, and commitment [63,67,70]. Conversely, failure to satisfac torily address consumer dissatisfaction represents a double failure: the failure originally prompting the complaint and the failure to provide a satisfactory resolution upon receipt of the complaint. This double failure can lead to re duced trust, customer defection, and damaging word-of-mouth (WOM) [7]. Despite the magnitude of the economic impact of e-commerce, most research on customer complaint handling has centered on the more traditional "bricks and mortar" off-line retail environment. To date, only a small number of descriptive studies have sought to identify and classify failures that occur in electronic retailing, the recovery strategies most commonly used by on-line selling channels, and the consequences of such strategies [2, 20, 32, 51]. Researchers generally accept that the Internet does not alter the fundamental principles of marketing [32]. Operating from this premise, findings from off line service-recovery studies are likely to be highly relevant in on-line contexts.

While failures in the traditional retail context are often attributable to employee behavior, failures in on-line retailing are most commonly due to system design flaws, delivery glitches, or problematic products [9,20,32,36]. Yet, in both on-line and off-line contexts, few empirical studies have examined the differential effects of the various failure types on the recovery framework (e.g., [9, 31, 64]). Business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce sites began operating in 1994, and numerous on-line sellers now claim to support a large and loyal clientele. Despite this claim, the experience of on-line purchasing is a relatively new phenomenon with a continuous influx of new buyers, particularly from in creasingly tech-sawy developing countries [33]. Representative of this, in 2008, E-Bit, a Brazilian company specializing in research on e-commerce, reported that 80 percent of Brazilians who were not yet on-line buyers intended to make at least one on-line purchase within 12 months [17]. Therefore, the adoption of Internet shopping is expected to continue to increase. Consequently, it is important to include consumer familiarity with on-line purchasing in general, and attitudes regarding the quality of past encounters, as a relevant antecedent of an on-line seller's recovery model. To date, e-commerce research has not fully explored these aspects. Consumers' system-based trust (i.e., their trust in e-commerce in general) and company-specific trust (i.e., their perceptions regarding the trustworthi ness of a specific company) may influence their intent to purchase [39,42,46]. Again, few empirical studies have simultaneously explored both system-based and company-specific trust and the impact of each on repurchase intentions, not to mention the interaction of these two types of trust within the e-commerce arena. The objective of this study is to extend the understanding of retailer recovery efforts and their consequences for the e-commerce environment. It examines the moderating roles of failure types, familiarity, and quality of prior experi ences in the recovery framework for Internet shopping in general as well as for customer interaction with a specific on-line retailer. Theoretical Foundation and Research Hypotheses Theory of Justice and Satisfaction with Complaint Handling As a basis for understanding the process of complaining and its outcomes, contemporary studies on complaint management offer substantial evidence supporting the importance of three specific dimensions of perceived fairness in complaint handling: distributive, procedural, and interactional fairness [10, 24, 64, 67]. The first dimension, distributive fairness, refers to the allocation of benefits and costs among the parties involved in a transaction. Within the context of a customer complaint, distributions are defined as the tangible outcomes offered by the company to the claimant (e.g., exchanging the product, reimbursement of expenses). The second dimension, procedural fairness, concerns the complaint handling policies and procedures used by a firm. Procedural fairness has</page><page sequence="3">INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE 129 six subdimensions: flexibility, accessibility, process control, decision control, speed of response, and acceptance of responsibility [67, 68]. Interactional fair ness, the third dimension, involves how company representatives treat and communicate with the customer during a complaint. Six subdimensions of interactional fairness have been studied: politeness, honesty, empathy, effort, explanation/causal account, and apologizing [15, 67]. Although there is no face-to-face contact between Internet customers and a company representative, the perception of interactional fairness during the resolution process is likely to influence customer attitudes about the com pany's fairness. The anthropomorphic conceptualization of the interactional relationship between consumers and a Web site is consistent with Latour's actor-network theory (ANT), in which the use of technology links human and nonhuman interactions in a chain such that they cannot be isolated [38, 65]. That is, ANT considers that webs of relations generate everything. Human and nonhuman elements of a network are defined as actors in a network, and not otherwise. Therefore, human properties of a technical element are created within the enactment of a relation with a nontechnical element. In other words, nonhuman elements may possess humanlike qualities and attributes when integrated in a system with human elements. In the case of consumers inter acting with Web sites, the system with which they interact may be viewed as possessing humanlike qualities with the ability to express humanlike attributes common to social relations (e.g., courtesy, honesty, empathy). This means that the interactional properties of a B2C exchange can be identified and may be important, not only for the satisfaction of the customer with the Web site, but also for the creation and maintenance of a long-lasting relationship between a company and customer. Moreover, consumers interact not only with a Web site, but also with a whole system composed of all the organizational members. Therefore, although often neglected in prior studies, the interactional aspect may play an important role in B2C interactions.1 According to the literature on social justice, perceived fairness dimensions contribute to satisfaction in various conflict situations [47]. Extending this logic to complaint handling, it is widely recognized that a customer's perceptions of the degree of fairness of a final outcome (distributive fairness), of the process that led to the outcome (procedural fairness), and of the manner in which the customer was treated and informed during the episode (interactional fair ness) will affect the customer's satisfaction with complaint handling [10, 24, 41, 43, 64, 67]. Holloway, Wang, and Parish found that, within the context of e-commerce, fairness dimensions have a strong impact on consumer satisfac tion with complaint handling [33]. Therefore, the following hypotheses related to on-line purchasing are presented: HI: Perceptions of distributive fairness will have a positive impact on con sumer satisfaction with complaint handling. HI: Perceptions of procedural fairness will have a positive impact on con sumer satisfaction with complaint handling. H3: Perceptions of interactional fairness will have a positive impact on con sumer satisfaction with complaint handling.</page><page sequence="4">130 PIZZUTT1 AND FERN AND ES Satisfaction with Complaint Handling and Consumer Trust Trust has long been seen as a fundamental element in explaining consumer repurchase behavior via traditional retailing channels and, more recently, on the Internet [6,23,50,52,55]. In this study, consumer trust in an on-line seller is defined as "the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of an other party based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party" [44, p. 712]. According to Chen and Dhillon, consumers are affected both by trust in a specific on-line seller and by trust in the Internet as a whole [13]. Similarly, Grabner-Kr?uter and Kaluscha identified two dimensions of trust in the e-commerce environment: system-based trust (i.e., trust in the Internet as a selling medium) and trust in a particular e-tailer (company trust) [26]. Despite this differentiation of trust dimensions, system-based trust has received little attention [26]. In studies of traditional off-line retailers, consumer satisfaction with com plaint handling is clearly linked to future attitudes and behaviors [9, 16, 67, 69]. However, prior work has focused more on the immediate intentions of behavior (e.g., repurchase intentions) and less on the attitudinal variables (e.g., trust). This deficiency is significant, as these attitudinal variables provide the foundation and rooting medium for consumer behaviors and establish the potential for a long-term relationship between consumer and retailer. In one exception, Tax, Brown, and Chandrashekaran explored the relationship between postcomplaint satisfaction and relational variables and found a significant and positive relationship between satisfaction with the complaint resolution and trust [67]. Similarly, e-commerce research has linked consumer satisfaction to company trust [55, 58]. Simply put, when customers perceive the complaint-handling performance of a company as fair and satisfactory, their feelings of trust tend to strengthen. Expanding on this finding, Ribbink et al. assert that satisfactory experiences with a specific company can inspire overall system-based trust [58]. Equally, research indicates that when a company disappoints a customer, the potential for an overall, and not just company-specific, negative view of e-commerce can arise. As examples, Ha and Coghill found that 21 percent of respondents would discontinue their on-line purchasing if they experienced a problem with a specific company, while Oldenburger et al. found that ap proximately 86 percent of customers who had positive experiences with pur chasing sites were likely to use e-commerce again, as compared to 22 percent of customers with negative experiences who said the same [27,53]. Based on this information, one may propose that: H4: Consumer satisfaction with complaint handling will have a positive impact on the consumer's trust in (a) the on-line seller in question and (b) e-commerce in general. Furthermore, and following McKnight and Chervany, it is proposed that the system-based trust of a consumer will directly influence the consumer's</page><page sequence="5">INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE 131 trust in specific on-line sellers [45]. When a salesperson is absent from, or at best peripheral to, the purchasing process, as is generally the case with on-line sellers, the primary winner or loser of consumer trust may be the Internet as a whole [26, 42, 49]. Therefore, system-based trust may influence trust in a specific on-line seller because of the perception of a guarantee of consistent and competent performance of the e-commerce enterprises operating within the on-line environment. This perception could be brought about by the belief that the Internet has legal or regulatory protections for consumers [45]. As such, in the absence of other cues to justify trust in a company, the perceived reliability of e-commerce as a whole transfers to the company and, for this reason, influences trust in a Web site. The literature also offers evidence for the existence of a corresponding relationship, namely, that a consumer's trust in an on-line seller is likely to enhance the consumer's system-based trust [26, 39]. According to Lee and Turban, merchant integrity is a major positive determinant of consumer trust of Internet shopping [39]. This is because, even for consumers who are skepti cal of e-commerce, one positive experience with an on-line seller may provide the evidence necessary to demonstrate that their assumptions of unreliability should not be universally applied. Therefore, the intervention of an on-line seller when a problem arises assures customers that this particular vendor site is safe despite whatever deficiencies exist in the overall Internet environment. Over time, if such interventions become standard and actual practices, the perception of the Internet as a safe and secure place may become more widely held and thus increase institution-based trust [45]. Although the study does not explore which type of trust comes first, system-based trust or trust in an on-line seller, it is proposed that: H5: Consumer trust in e-commerce in general will have a reciprocal impact on consumer trust in the on-line seller. Antecedents of Loyalty In the words of Reichheld and Schefter: "Loyalty is not won with technology, but through the consistent delivery of greater value to the customer" [57, p. 113]. Loyalty is usually measured by two outcome dimensions: consumer repurchase intention and positive WOM. Credible WOM is highly important for future transactions in the on-line environment [14]. Empirical studies emphasize trust as a fundamental determinant of con sumer loyalty in traditional off-line retailing [1, 50, 67]. This relationship has been validated in the on-line environment, including in the context of C2C transactions [12,29,40]. In fact, system-based trust may be even more relevant for loyalty in the on-line context due to the absence of physical contact and other tangible aspects present in the traditional retailing experience. Despite this research, Ribbink et al. noted a continued lack of empirical evidence establishing a link between trust and loyalty in the on-line environment [58]. Thus, it is hypothesized:</page><page sequence="6">132 PIZZUTTI AND FERN ANDES H6: Consumer trust in the on-line seller will have a positive impact on con sumer intentions for (a) future purchasing from the on-line seller and (b) the spread of positive WOM regarding the on-line seller. H7: Consumer trust in e-commerce in general will have a positive impact on consumer intentions for (a) future purchasing via the Internet and (b) the spread of positive WOM about e-commerce. Moderating Role of Familiarity Familiarity is "one's understanding of an entity, often based on previous interactions, experience and learning of the what, who, how and when of what is happening" [37, p. 946]. Specific to this context, familiarity with an on-line store refers to how well a user knows the vendor and the procedures necessary to make on-line purchases (e.g., navigation in the site, information search, payment procedures). When consumers are more familiar with a company, their expectations, shaped by the performance they believe possible based on their prior experi ence, tend to be more realistic [66, 71]. Experienced on-line consumers are more likely to understand that service failure/recovery is a relatively common phenomenon within e-commerce and thus be less apt to exhibit a negative reaction to this type of event. On the other hand, new on-line consumers, less familiar with the process and lacking the necessary experience from which to establish reasonable expectations, may be more willing to make judgments about an on-line seller based upon a single encounter [33]. Based on this logic, the following hypothesis is offered: H8: Familiarity with the on-line seller will moderate the relationship between satisfaction with complaint handling and consumer trust in the on-line seller; as familiarity increases, the strength of the corresponding relationship between satisfaction and trust will decrease. Subsequently, familiarity can also be characteristic of on-line purchasing experiences in general and not specific only to a particular on-line seller [6]. From this perspective, consumers accumulate system-based knowledge, thus developing electronic purchasing skills. In the same direction as the previous hypothesis, a single failure episode will not affect the system-based trust of consumers who are familiar with e-commerce and have a history of positive past interactions to the same degree that it may affect a novice consumer. H9: Familiarity with e-commerce in general will moderate the relationship between satisfaction with complaint handling and consumer trust in e-com merce; as familiarity increases, the strength of the corresponding relationship between satisfaction and trust will decrease. Garbarino and Johnson found that trust has a high impact on the repurchase intentions of consumers engaged in a strong relationship with a seller [23].</page><page sequence="7">INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE 133 Given that familiarity is a likely indication of a close relationship with a retailer, one may posit that the link between trust and repurchase intentions will be stronger among consumers with high familiarity, whereas among those with low familiarity, strong trust will not necessarily predict repurchase intentions. Moreover, consumers with high familiarity and high levels of system-based and company-specific trust will more frequently recommend and provide posi tive WOM about specific e-tailers and e-commerce in general than consumers with low familiarity. Thus: H10: Familiarity with an on-line seller will moderate the relationship between consumer trust in the on-line seller and intentions for (a) future purchasing from the seller and (b) the spread of positive WOM regarding the seller. As familiarity increases, the strength of these relationships will increase. HU: Familiarity with e-commerce in general will moderate the relationship between consumer trust in e-commerce and intentions for (a) future purchas ing via the Internet and (b) the spread of positive WOM about e-commerce. As familiarity increases, the strength of these relationships will increase. Moderating Role of the Quality of Prior Experiences Because trust is not generally formed based on a single positive experience but is, rather, the result of a series of successive positive interactions with a company, it is expected that not just familiarity but also the perceived qual ity of past experiences will moderate the relationship between satisfaction and trust. The consumer's assessment of the quality of an experience with a specific on-line seller or with the on-line environment in general could be positive, with good, pleasant, and valuable meaning, or negative, with bad, unpleasant, and valueless meaning. Tax et al. found that positive prior experiences mitigate the normally nega tive effects on consumer trust and loyalty brought about by poor complaint handling [67]. Likewise, Anderson and Sullivan found that consumers would forgive the failure event of an on-line seller with a history of delivering high quality [3]. Moreover, customers with high expectations for relationship continuity may be less demanding of immediate compensation for a failure because they consider the balance of equity (distributive fairness) across a longer horizon of exchanges [22, 30]. In contrast, other research has shown that customers with positive past experiences are, in fact, more demanding with respect to recovery expectations as a result of higher standards stemming from a history of exceptional interac tions. When service failures occur in these situations, the expectations of greater seller inputs translate into higher consumer recovery expectations [30]. Finding greater empirical evidence of the former reasoning?positive expe riences mitigate the impact of bad complaint handling?it is posited that: H12: The quality of prior experiences with the on-line seller will moderate the relationship between satisfaction with complaint handling and trust in the</page><page sequence="8">134 PIZZUTTI AND FERN ANDES on-line seller, such that positive experiences will mitigate the negative effects on trust of low satisfaction with complaint handling. H13: The quality of prior experiences with e-commerce in general will moderate the relationship between satisfaction with complaint handling and consumer trust in e-commerce, such that positive experiences will mitigate the negative effects on trust of low satisfaction with complaint handling. Moderating Role of Failure Type Service recovery literature identifies two basic types of service failure: outcome failure and process failure [9, 64]. An outcome failure occurs when a basic product or service need is not fulfilled. A process failure occurs when there is a flaw in the process of purchasing or delivering the product or service, but not in the product itself. Researchers have conducted empirical studies to examine failure-type effects within the traditional off-line retail setting (e.g., [9, 31, 64]). However, studies of e-commerce failure types have been limited and only descriptive in nature [20, 32]. The identification of service failure types is useful in further understanding consumer reactions to these events, as well as in the development of successful e-commerce recovery strategies. It is argued that customers will expect the firm's complaint handling to exhibit corrections that not only correspond to the specific outcome or process failure cited in the complaint, but also to the fairness dimension that the consumer perceives as violated. For example, if delivery was delayed (a process failure), the consumer will not tolerate a slow service recovery (procedural fairness). In the same way, if a broken product was delivered (an outcome failure), the customer will require either a refund of all expenses associated with the purchase or a substitute or replacement product of equal or greater value (distributive fairness). It is here predicted that failure type will moderate the effect of the fairness dimension. That is, when a consumer experiences a process failure, procedural fairness will exert a higher impact on satisfaction. When a consumer experi ences an outcome failure, distributive fairness will have a higher impact on satisfaction. Because there is no prior research to anticipate the moderating role of failure type on the effect of interactional fairness on satisfaction, its impact is not specified a priori, although it will be examined a posteriori. Based on the relationships established: H14: Failure type will moderate the effect of fairness dimensions on satisfac tion such that the impact of procedural fairness will be stronger for process failures than for outcome failures, and the impact of distributive fairness will be stronger for outcome failures than for process failures. Based on the literature and established hypotheses, Figure 1 presents the theoretical model investigated.</page><page sequence="9">INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE 135 Figure 1. Contingency Framework for Understanding the Effect of Recovery Efforts on Consumer Trust and Loyalty in E-Tail Method A cross-sectional survey using an on-line questionnaire was administered to Brazilian customers. The survey was accomplished in partnership with E-Bit (www.ebit.com.br). E-Bit has databases from a number of e-tailers, includ ing two of Brazil's largest companies, Submarino and Americanas.com. The database used in the study consisted of data from consumers who had made an on-line purchase within the previous six months. From these data, only consumers who had experienced a failure and had complained to the on-line seller were asked to answer the survey. The initial data set included 3,339 respondents collected in November 2006. In exchange for their involvement, participants received 7,000 "bits," which could be used to compete for prizes on the E-Bit site. Measures The initial portion of the survey instrument contained open-ended questions that required subjects to report the details of a recent unsatisfactory on-line purchase experience that led to the filing of a complaint with the on-line seller. Details included a description of the nature of the failure/mistake that occurred with the purchase via Internet, the respondent's belief about why</page><page sequence="10">136 PIZZUTTI AND FERNANDES it might have happened, the media used to lodge the complaint, and the ap proximate date of the complaint. The critical incident technique (CIT) was used to distinguish, categorize, and analyze for failure type [19]. CIT is a form of narrative content analysis that involves the classification of critical events as related via stories. The goal of the analysis is to identify emergent patterns or themes. CIT has been suc cessfully used in many areas of marketing research (e.g., [9, 35, 48]). The typologies of incidents developed by Holloway and Beatty and by Forbes, Kelley, and Hoffman were used as a starting point for analysis of the failures reported [20,32]. Two researchers previously trained in classification schemes separately codified the incidents by distinguishing and inserting them into the failure categories identified by the aforementioned authors. To develop a consistent pattern of encryption, all the incidents were reread and analyzed by the researchers so as to combine similar episodes into significant categories. Within this first round of analysis, researchers separated out inci dents that were not suited to any of the existing types. After this individual encoding of complaint episodes, the results of the researchers were compared. There was an 87 percent agreement rate between the two researchers in the classification of incidents. Following the encoding procedures, and to improve the reliability of data gathered in the trials, a third researcher codified the 13 percent of incidents that had been classified differently by the two research ers [56]. This third classification resolved the discrepancies between the first and second researchers. Following the initial open-ended questions, scaled measures adapted from previous studies on service recovery and trust literature were applied. The measures of interactional (6 items), procedural (6 items), distributive fairness (4 items), and satisfaction with complaint handling (3 items) were taken from Tax et al. [67]. Consumer trust (8 items; 4 related to trust in the on-line seller and 4 related to trust in e-commerce) were adapted from Sirdeshmukh, Singh, and Sabol [62]. Repurchase intention (4 items) and positive WOM (3 items) were adapted from Oliver and Swan and from Zeithaml, Berry, and Parasuraman [54, 72]. Quality of prior experience (6 items; 3 related to experience with the on-line seller and 3 related to experience with the Internet purchases) were adapted from Tax et al. [67]. And finally, familiarity (6 items; 3 related to fa miliarity with the on-line seller and 3 related to familiarity with the Internet purchases environment) were adapted from Bart et al. [6]. All measures used a five-point Likert scale. These measures were translated into Portuguese using the back-translation technique and submitted to face validity during which two marketing profes sors identified problems related to the scale questions. The questionnaire was modified as requested and a pretest with 15 subjects was carried out. Based on the pretest results, no additional changes to the survey instruments were necessary. The Appendix provides the scale items used. Method of Analysis Given the central objective?to test the elaborated hypotheses and examine the statistical significance of the proposed model? structural equation mod</page><page sequence="11">INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE 137 eling (SEM) was utilized. Following Byrne's recommendation, the estima tion method chosen was iteratively reweighted generalized least squares (ERLS), available in EQS software, which is not based on the prerogative of normality [11]. The moderating hypotheses of H8 through H14 were tested using multi group structural equation analysis. This approach allowed for the simultaneous estimation of the theoretical model for each group of respondents: the ones who revealed familiarity (experience) as low (negative), and the ones who revealed it as high (positive); also, the ones who had suffered a procedure failure, and the ones who had suffered an outcome failure. This made it pos sible to test whether the estimated coefficients varied for all groups [61]. All the parameters were initially restricted as invariant. Subsequently, based on the Lagrange multiplier test, parameters that had significant indicators were "released" [11]. Results The survey results are presented in the following manner: First, a general profile of the sample and of the failure classifications. Next, the measure ment model using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The structural model was examined after the validity and reliability of the measures used was established. The data were examined to ensure that they conformed to the multivariate assumptions of normality (tested through Mardia's coefficient), homoscedas ticity (through Box's M test), and linearity (through bivariate scatter plots). Cases labeled as outliers identified by the Mahalanobis distance were removed. Following these examinations, the sample consisted of 3,206 for a response rate of 16.5 percent. This was a high response rate for a voluntary survey limited to dissatisfied customers who had filed a complaint. Sample Profile The sample consisted of individual consumers residing in different areas of Brazil. All 27 Brazilian states were represented in the sample, as well as a broad range of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Respondent ages ranged from 18 to 75, with the largest percentage (39.4%) between the ages of 25 and 35. More than half (60.7%) were male. Educationally, 81.8 percent of the respondents had a high school degree. Regarding monthly household income, 38 percent were at or above US$2,000. Most complaints (40.7%) were submitted via e-mail, 16.9 percent by telephone, and 36.7 percent employed both telephone and e-mail. The highest percentage of complaints had been made within the previous three months (57.6%) with the remainder made within three and six months prior. This showed that all the complaint episodes were reasonably recent, with over half considered very recent, thus increasing the likelihood of reliable respondent reporting. Overall, the respondents were experienced on-line shoppers (mean score of 4.26 for Familiarity with Internet Purchasing on a Likert scale of 5), reported</page><page sequence="12">138 PIZZUTTI AND FERN AND ES favorable views of their prior on-line experiences (mean score of 4.28 for Prior Experiences with Internet Purchases), and reported moderately high trust in e-commerce in general (mean score of 3.79 for Trust in E-commerce). With regard to the on-line seller specified in their complaint, respondents reported less familiarity (3.55), less satisfaction with their prior experiences (3.81), and neutral feelings of trust (3.11). Perceptions of fairness dimensions were gener ally clustered in the neutral mid-point of the Likert scale (Interactional = 2.93, Procedural = 2.95, Distributive = 3.03). The likelihood of offering positive WOM and repurchase intentions from the e-seller was on the low side (2.82 and 2.89, respectively), especially as compared with the likelihood of positive WOM for e-commerce in general (4.36) and the continued likelihood of future on-line purchasing (4.43). These findings are presented in the Appendix. Failures in Virtual Retailing: Classification The typology of failures identified in the present study fit well with prior clas sifications available in the literature. Of the reported failures, none was found to justify the formation of a new category. Two previously identified failure types were not found in this data: policy failure and security problems. Nev ertheless, when the results were compared to prior studies, both differences and similarities were found in the distribution of failures across categories. "Slow service," referring to delivery delays, accounted for 20 percent of the failures reported by Holloway and Beatty in 2003,15.9 percent of those reported by Forbes, Kelley, and Hoffman in 2005, and 32.5 percent of failures in the current study [20, 32]. "Packaging errors," including delivery of only part of an order or delivery of nonrequested items, had a frequency rate of 8.6 percent in this study, 13.7 percent in Holloway and Beatty, and 43.0 percent in Forbes et al. [20, 32]. "Product defect," including broken or damaged products, repre sented 23.2 percent of total failures in the current sample. Holloway and Beatty reported a much lower occurrence (1.6%), with Forbes et al. reporting 12.2 percent [20, 32]. The "bad information" failure type includes situations in which the customer made a purchase based on information regarding a prod uct and later deemed its features to be confusing, incorrect, or insuf ficient. The prevalence of this failure type was 11.2 percent for the present study, 8.6 percent for Holloway and Beatty, and 5.3 percent for Forbes et al. [20, 32]. "System pricing" failures include incidents in which a product is advertised on the Web at a specific price but the customer is charged another price. This failure category showed very low frequency rates of less than 6 percent in all the studies, and the same was true for "out of stock" and "Web site system failure" (technical problems of the Web site).</page><page sequence="13">INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE 139 An "item never received" failure includes when a customer places an order and receives the item whether paid for or not. This failure represented 11.3 percent of Holloway and Beatty's sample, compared with 5.8 percent in the current study. Forbes et al. did not report this type of failure [20, 32]. "Customer service problems" include incidents during service support or concerning return policy and represented 4.4 percent of the failures in this study, 9.8 percent in the study by Holloway and Beatty, and was not reported by Forbes et al. [20, 32]. After classifying the incidents and following the same two-researcher procedure from CIT, each of these nine failure types was classified as either a process or an outcome failure. Smith et al. define outcome failures as those related to a product or service outcome (i.e., the core product or service), and process failures as those related to service processes (i.e., customer service, delivery) [64]. In other words, outcome failures are more tangible and related to the product or service bought, whereas process failures are less tangible and peripheral to the product or core service. Based on these definitions, this exercise resulted in a classification correspondence rate of 100 percent between the two researchers. As a result of the classification processes, the following failure types were categorized as process failures: (1) slow service, (6) bad information, (7) Web site system, and (8) customer service problems. The other failure types were categorized as outcome failures: (2) system price, (3) packaging errors, (4) product in stock, (5) product defect, and (9) item never received. Table 1 presents a summary of these data as well as examples of failures as described by respondents. Validity and Reliability For the measurement model, and in line with the work of Anderson and Gerbing, all observed variables were forced to load on their respective latent variables and were not allowed to cross-load [4]. Results of the confirma tory factor analysis indicate that the measurement model fit the data well (X2 = 18,974.54, df= 1,297; CFI = 0.96; NFI and NNFI = 0.95; RMSEA = 0.06). The chi-square statistic was significant (p &lt; 0.001), but this was expected because of the sensitivity of the chi-square statistic to large sample sizes (n &gt; 200; [28]). All measures included in the analysis were reliable, with construct reliability estimates that ranged from 0.73 to 0.90. In addition, convergent validity was supported, as all items loaded strongly and significantly on their respective factors, and the average variance extracted (AVE) for each latent variable exceeded 0.50 [21]. The correlations among constructs were all below the 0.90 threshold, suggesting that all constructs are distinct from one another. Furthermore, the average variance extracted for each latent factor exceeded the respective squared correlation between factors, providing evidence of discriminant validity [21].

The Appendix provides means, standard devia tions, standardized loadings, composite reliabilities, and Cronbach's alpha coefficients. Examination of Hypotheses Table 3 provides the findings obtained by the analysis of the structural model with a base of 3,206 respondents. The chi-square value is significant. However, since this test is highly sensitive to normality deviations and to samples greater than 200, one should consider the analysis of the chi-square value along with other adjustment criteria [28]. Goodness-of-fit indexes CFI, NFI, and NNFI, all over 0.90, are satisfactory, and the RMSEA of 0.05 is acceptable. The impact of consumer fairness perceptions on satisfaction with complaint handling established in hypotheses Hl, H2, and H3 was supported by the results. The consumer evaluations of processes during complaint handling (procedural fairness) had the smallest influence on satisfaction with complaint handling (regression coefficient of 0.20). In addition, fairness of the outcomes obtained through complaint (distributive fairness) had a higher effect on satis faction (0.50) than how well or poorly a customer felt company representatives treated them (interactional fairness) (0.34). The results also support hypothesis H4a predicting that satisfaction with complaint handling would affect customer trust of the on-line seller in question. However, a significant relationship between consumer trust in the specific on line seller and trust in e-commerce overall, as set forth in H5, was not found. Satisfaction with the company's complaint handling had only a small impact on the consumer's general trust in e-commerce (0.26), thus supporting H4b. This indicates that, in conflict situations, specific perceptions of an episode may affect (enhancing or depleting) trust in the other party involved in the dispute, but this effect does not extend to other parties. The impact of customer trust in the specific on-line seller on consumer loy alty as measured by repurchase intentions and positive WOM was confirmed (H6a, H6b). Similarly, and supporting H7a and H7b, trust in on-line purchas ing in general was positively associated with both repurchase intentions and positive WOM. To test the moderating hypothesis, the sample was divided into three subgroups based on consumer-reported levels of familiarity. Respondents reporting low familiarity were assigned to the "low familiarity group" (n = 314 with e-commerce in general, and n = 609 with the specific on-line seller). Re spondents reporting high familiarity were assigned to the "high familiarity group" (n = 1,587 with e-commerce in general, and n = 975 with the specific on-line seller). Those who indicated medium levels of familiarity were ex cluded to reflect more accurately the nature of the moderation, which could be obfuscated by the inclusion of intermediate values. Initially, all paths were held invariant across the two data sets, and a fully constrained model was estimated. Related to familiarity with e-commerce in general, the fit statistics obtained for this model were as follows: x2 = 3,535,</page><page sequence="18">144 PIZZUTTI AND FERN ANDES Table 3.

Subsequently, based on the Lagrange multiplier (LM) test, paths with significant test statistics were released sequentially until further freeing up of constraints failed to enhance model fit. The resultant coefficients are presented in Table 4. Compared to the fully constrained model, the final model, with the three parameters (satisfaction-trust, trust-repurchase, and trust-positive WOM) released to be different, produced the following fit statistics: %2 = 3,514, df= 1,312, NFI = 0.94, CFI = 0.98, and RMSEA = 0.04 (A%2 = 21, Adf= 3, p &lt; 0.001). Likewise tested was the moderation of familiarity with the specific on-line seller. Compared to the fully constrained model, the final model yielded a dif ference in the %2 statistic of 76, with associated df of 3 (p &lt; 0.001). The resultant coefficients are presented in Table 4. Based on the findings, H8 and H9 were confirmed. That is, the higher a customer's familiarity (with the on-line seller/with e-commerce), the lower the impact of satisfaction with complaint handling on trust (in the on-line seller/ in e-commerce). Thus, for less familiar customers, satisfaction with complaint handling had a bigger effect on their trust in the company. Customers with a higher level of familiarity were affected by the specific episode, but also factor in their previous experiences with the on-line seller to determine their trust judgments. On the other hand, the relationship between trust and loyalty inten tions (repurchase and positive WOM) was stronger among customers highly familiar with the site, confirming H10, but was weaker among consumers with high familiarity with e-commerce, in the opposite direction of Hll. To examine HI 2 and HI3, which posited that past positive experiences would minimize the negative impact on trust of low postcomplaint satisfac tion, a subgroup of respondents with low levels of satisfaction with complaint handling was selected from the whole sample. This subgroup was further divided in two: respondents with negative, and respondents with positive, prior experiences. The "positive prior experience group" included 563 and 346 respondents (with e-commerce in general and the on-line seller, respectively); and in the "negative prior experience group" there were 233 and 266 (with e-commerce in general and with the on-line seller, respectively). All first-time customers were excluded from these groups as they lacked positive or nega tive prior experience ratings. Related to the quality of experiences with the on-line seller, the final model (with the parameter satisfaction-trust released to be different across the groups) produced the following fit statistics: %2 = 2,846, df = 1,314, NFI = 0.94, CFI = 0.98, and RMSEA = 0.04 (A%2 = 16, Adf= 1, p &lt; 0.02, compared to the fully constrained model). In the case of quality of experiences with e-commerce, the LM test did not indicate any path with significant test statistics. This indicates that there is no difference between the groups of consumers with negative and positive experiences. The study also explored the moderation effect of quality of prior experi ences in case of higher satisfaction with the complaint handling to see if the result was similar (lower effect of satisfaction among consumers with positive experiences). Based on the LM test, all parameters should be held the same (constrained). Table 4 presents these findings.</page><page sequence="20">VI ?)

The impact of low satisfaction with complaint handling on trust in the on-line seller was higher (0.78) among customers with prior seller-specific negative experiences than among those with prior seller specific positive experiences (0.62). This indicates that positive prior experi ences lead the buyer to excuse the company for one poorly handled complaint. On the other hand, high levels of satisfaction with complaint handling have a maintenance effect among all customers regardless of their previous experi ences. In a broader scope, the effect exerted by low satisfaction with complaint handling on trust in the Internet in general is limited (0.33) for both groups of customers?those with positive past e-commerce experiences, and those with negative past e-commerce experiences?thus rejecting H13. Finally, the moderating hypotheses (H14) highlight possible differences in the strength of the relationships established between fairness dimensions and satisfaction due to the type of failure experienced?process or outcome. To test the moderating role of type of failure, the complete sample was divided into two subgroups: process failure types (n = 1,381) and outcome failure types (n = 1,811). Fourteen respondents reporting episodes with more than one failure type were removed from the sample. This moderation was also tested using multigroup structural equation analysis. The results indicated a significant improvement to the model by adding the moderator impact (Ax2 = 314; Ad/=3;p&lt;0.00). The results in Table 4 indicate different relationships between fairness dimen sions and satisfaction in the two groups of consumers?those that experienced process failures and those that experienced outcome failures. Following the predictions of H14, the impact of procedural fairness for consumers with process failures was 0.31 and for consumers with outcome failures was 0.09. Likewise, the impact of distributive fairness for consumers with outcome failures was 0.59, whereas for consumers with process failures it was 0.41. This result corroborates the hypotheses that failure type (outcome or process) will moderate the effects exerted by the violation of a fairness dimension (distributive, procedural, or in teractional) on satisfaction with complaint handling. In other words, the impact of the fairness dimension is reinforced when it fits the type of failure experienced by the customer. This indicates that during the recovery process customers pay more attention to those fairness issues that mostly closely correspond to the service failure experienced. For example, if the company failed in a procedural aspect (e.g., promised date of delivery), the recovery process should pay special attention to procedural fairness (e.g., date correction promised). In summary, the findings suggest that consumer satisfaction with a company's recovery ef forts is heavily influenced by the approach taken by management to address the failure. Moreover, the findings suggest that consumers pay more attention, and attach more importance, to interactional aspects when an outcome failure is involved (0.51) than when a process failure is experienced (0.27). Therefore, the higher similarity between characteristics of procedural and interactional fairness than between characteristics of distributive and interactional fairness cannot explain the moderating role of failure type on the effect exerted by in teractional fairness on satisfaction with complaint handling. On the contrary, outcome failures seem to strongly trigger (0.51) the need for interactional (hu man) mechanisms during service recovery. One might also note that customers</page><page sequence="23">INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE 149 suffering outcome failures rated the on-line seller significantly lower on fairness, trust, and loyalty than the scores given by customers who experienced process failures (from an ANOVA analysis). Therefore, compared with process failures, outcome failures seem to cause a more pronounced negative reaction with the customer, thus requiring a higher standard of interactional fairness to satisfy the customer during recovery efforts. Conclusions and Implications This paper aimed to provide and test a contingency framework by empirically investigating the effects of consumers' evaluations of recovery efforts on trust and loyalty in e-commerce in general. Consistent with prior studies on B2C in the traditional off-line retail environment, the results support the view that per ceived fairness dimensions (procedural, distributive, and interactional) have a strong influence on consumer satisfaction with on-line shopping complaint situations, which in turn are strongly associated with consumer trust and loyalty. A model was proposed that examined relationships between specific on-line seller recovery evaluations and general attitudes about on-line pur chasing (e.g., trust in e-commerce, e-commerce repurchase intentions, positive e-commerce WOM). The findings confirmed that complaint recovery efforts help companies establish trustworthiness with their customers, but these efforts have little influence on a customer's view of e-commerce as a whole. The study also explored the effects of the consumer's prior experiences with e-commerce as well as with specific on-line sellers. Last, it examined the impact of two broad types of failure?process and outcome. To date, few studies have differentially examined the impact of these types of failure, even in off-line retailing research (e.g., [9, 31, 64]). Each contribution provides new insights into the recovery process involving consumers and e-commerce providers. The study produced an important insight pertaining to the fairness evalu ations of consumers and their satisfaction with complaint handling. In the on-line environment, interactional aspects were expected to be a weak or non existent factor in satisfaction with complaint handling because there is little opportunity for service employees to be in contact with consumers. However, this study revealed that interactional characteristics might be essential for consumers to feel that they have been treated fairly and satisfactorily. In the absence of a salesperson, the on-line seller itself becomes a surrogate imbued by the customer with characteristics that typify salespeople. As such, an expe rience with an on-line seller has the capacity to affect customer attitudes and beliefs in much the same way as an experience with a live salesperson [29, 39]. That many sites now provide consumers with the opportunity to speak directly with a representative during and after a purchase seems to indicate positive movement in fulfilling this consumer requirement. Positive prior experiences help mitigate the impact of low satisfaction with complaint handling on the consumer's trust in the on-line seller. However, it was also noted that low satisfaction with complaint handling reduces con sumer trust faster than high satisfaction with complaint handling enhances trust, regardless of the quality of a consumer's past experiences.</page><page sequence="24">250 PIZZUTTI AND FERNANDES It was also found that different dimensions of perceived fairness (distribu tive, procedural, or interactional) affect postcomplaint satisfaction differently depending on the type of failure (process or outcome) the consumer experi enced. Perceptions of distributive fairness, such as refunds or replacements, and perceptions of interactional fairness, such as courtesy and honesty, enhance satisfaction feelings in a stronger way when outcome failures occur (e.g., a problem with the product). Conversely, perceptions of procedural fair ness, such as response speed, flexibility, and other procedures favoring the customer, will have a significant impact on satisfaction only when a process failure occurs (e.g., delivery of product failures). Therefore, the company's complaint-handling strategy should take into account the type of failure that occurred. Consequently, companies may become even more dependent on their service staff's ability to interpret the specifics of each service failure and, during recovery, to take into consideration the specific needs and experiences of the consumer when formulating an approach to a resolution. Training specific to these findings should be designed to ensure that customer service representatives implement the most appropriate recovery actions based on the unique characteristics of each complaint. On this point, a note of caution should be applied to these conclusions. Although the complaint-handling process should devote special attention to the specific aspect of fairness most closely matching the type of failure experienced, the company should not overlook other fairness dimensions, especially when a process failure occurs. Although the impact of both distribu tive and interactional fairness dimensions is higher under an outcome failure, they remain significant under process failures as well. The findings indicate that, while there is an increase in the effect of distributive and interactional dimensions when outcome failures are involved, these dimensions are also relevant (although to a lesser degree) when process failures are involved. On the other hand, procedural fairness perceptions seem to be relevant only for process failures. As to the interplay between trust and loyalty, it was found that greater consumer trust after the recovery process will result in a higher probability of future exchanges and a long-term relationship. The findings also revealed that this relationship is somewhat influenced by the customer's level of fa miliarity (it is stronger among customers with high site-specific familiarity and customers with low e-commerce familiarity). Although, this result may seem contradictory, a closer look reveals its logic. Familiarity with an on-line seller may be an indication of knowledge the customer has from past interac tions. With high familiarity, customers are likely to attribute their trust (or mistrust) to the competence (or incompetence) of the on-line seller and thus be more capable of accurately predicting its behavior. Therefore, for customers with high familiarity, trust in the on-line seller will strongly enhance loyalty behaviors. For consumers with low familiarity with e-commerce as a whole, their loyalty behaviors will be more dependent on their system-based trust (trust in e-commerce overall) because they are more insecure about safety and privacy aspects [5]. Consumers of this type will purchase on-line only if they have a high level of trust in the Internet as a shopping channel. This is in contrast to consumers with high levels of e-commerce familiarity because</page><page sequence="25">INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE 151 they are confident in their ability to choose competent on-line retailers and will make on-line purchases regardless of their trust feelings toward the on line environment as a whole. Moreover, consumers with high familiarity with a specific Web site are more likely to have had positive prior experiences with that particular site; yet high familiarity with e-commerce does not always indicate prior positive experi ences with e-commerce. Consumers highly familiar with e-commerce may have learned, through their experiences with fakes and unreliable Web sites, to identify the reputable ones. Therefore, familiarity does not significantly affect the relationship between trust and loyalty in the e-commerce environment. Finally, given that customers with lower levels of familiarity will confer a level of trust in an on-line retailer that is directly proportional to their experi ence of satisfaction, the relevance of e-tailer complaint recovery efforts for these customers is highly relevant, as their satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) strongly dictates their future behavior. Study Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research The study's limitations should be kept in mind when considering its contribu tions. This paper used a cross-sectional approach based on a nonprobabilistic sample composed of people who have purchased from the Internet when data collection occurred. The sample respondents had a high level of posi tive on-line purchasing experiences, high familiarity with the Internet, and high familiarity with the on-line seller in question. Additionally, the study explored B2C transactions and may not easily generalize to other transaction types (e.g., B2B and C2C). Many companies, including the Internet search powerhouse Google, see Brazil as "one of the most interesting countries among the emerging markets" [25]. Recent research reported by Citigroup and based on the Morgan Stanley Country Index shows that Brazil has become the world's largest emerging market [34]. With its large population, Brazil should certainly be of inter est to corporations and researchers seeking to understand the consumption habits of its consumers. Nevertheless, this raises the question of whether the findings reported here can be generalized to a different context. Although the discussion here provides both conceptual and empirical support for the study results, it is important for future research to test the developed framework in different cultures. Since 2006 (when the data were gathered), Internet penetration has contin ued to increase, especially in developing countries, and so has the rate of on-line shopping. On-line retail sales in the United States are expected to grow by ap proximately $25 billion each year for the next five years, reaching somewhere between $215 billion and $335 billion by 2012 [59]. In Brazil, e-commerce sales reached $4 billion in 2008, a 30 percent increase over the previous year and a 100 percent increase in relation to 2006 [17]. These growth trends reinforce the importance of appropriate and effective complaint-handling efforts in the on-line environment. Moreover, increasing competition among worldwide on-line sellers serves to further enhance the relevance of customer loyalty?a</page><page sequence="26">252 PIZZUTTI AND FERN ANDES benefit frequently awarded or withdrawn based on a customer's satisfaction with complaint handling. Finally, with more consumers using the Internet as a shopping channel, research focusing on the general attitudes of consumers toward the environment is likely to become a less interesting issue than stud ies focused on different aspects of the on-line transactions. Contrasting with this positive scenario for e-commerce, the descriptive data showed that consumers' perceptions of fairness are quite tepid and strongly indicate that on-line sellers have many opportunities for improvement in this area. Future research should look for a deeper understanding of how to design on-line retailer sites that convey a commitment to procedural, distributive, and interactional fairness and that employ effective recovery mechanisms. Qualitative studies would help reach this understanding. They may be espe cially important in shedding light on perceived interactional fairness and its relationship with other aspects of the recovery efforts. In addition, note that the gender split in this study is different from recent findings in U.S.-based studies. As such, an examination of how these aspects play out for female versus male customers would be useful. Following Bhandari, Tsarenko, and Polonsky's suggestion that different mechanisms have the potential to affect consumer trust and WOM differently, and that these differences will vary depending on the type of failure experi enced (outcome or process), new research could further explore how specific recovery mechanisms affect outcomes [8]. This study suggests that additional corrective actions may be required in instances when the desired product or service is not delivered, as opposed to when there is a process-related or tech nical problem. Along these lines, and following Smith et al., future research should seek to measure not only the type of failure, but also the magnitude of the failure and its impact on the B2C relationship [64]. Interaction effects between the magnitude of the failure and recovery efforts are expected to oc cur because customers would demand different levels of recovery depending on the severity of failure. As a result, not only the type of failure but also the magnitude of the failure might determine the level of recovery required to restore perceived justice. NOTE 1.
