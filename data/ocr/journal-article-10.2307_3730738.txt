The role of recurrence and repetition within the structure of the novel is also well discussed, as is the way Zola uses the construction of individual chapters to counterpoint the overall rhythm of L'Assommoir. One regrets only the absence of any extended discussion of the novel's linguistic registers, and more particularly of their evolution, but this is perhaps a pardonable lacuna in a book intended primarily for a non-French-reading audience. A brief bibliography lists the major critical works on Zola, even if the omission ofJean Borie's Zola et les mythes comes as something of a surprise. Lilian Furst's book thus turns out in the final analysis to be a rather frustrating work of the curate's egg variety. Marred as it is by some faulty scholarship, not all of which has been grumbled about here (there are a number of smaller errors, notably in the opening chronology, and a consistent and wholly unforgivable misspelling of the name of the greatest of current Zola specialists, Henri Mitterand), it should be used with caution by the beginner, who will none the less find in it a persuasive and cogent reading of Zola's novel and most notably of its main character. UNIVERSITY OF KENT ROGER CLARK A Day in the Country and Other Stories. By GUY DE MAUPASSANT. Trans. by DAVID COWARD. (World's Classics) Oxford: Oxford University Press. I990. xxiv + 32pp. ?3.95. In Normandy, streets and schools bear witness to his native greatness. Parisian critics, however, more ambiguously lament Maupassant's enduring popularity in the English-speaking world; for this is explained in terms of our presumed fondness for the minor genre in which the writer made his reputation. David Coward's excellent translation will reinforce that appeal. The latter is likely to survive the scholarship so impressively rallied in support of the three-volume Pleiade rehabili- tation. This selection of twenty-seven stories extends from En canot ( 1876) to Le Horla (1887), and it skilfully accommodates the different registers in which Maupassant worked. The annotation provides details of the original publication of the texts concerned and elucidates contemporary allusions. There is also a select biblio- graphy, a chronological summary of Maupassant's career, and a brief appendix which includes excerpts of the views expressed by Henry James, Anatole France, and more recent commentators. Coward's introduction is a model of compression. It rightly focuses on the ways in which formal devices dramatize the writer's eclectic vision. The structure of experience chronicled in the stories is underlined by precisely those ironic twists which transform the apparently slight into the potenti- ally disturbing. From the ribald to the hallucinatory, Maupassant's telling explores a range of emotions at some distance from an unequivocal and notorious despair. As far as its biographical origins may be concerned, Coward refuses either to speculate in psychoanalytical directions or to indulge the prurient. If Coward sees Mau- passant's stories as 'the celebration of a fine contempt' (p. xix), he likens the reader to those ladies who were the victims of his practical jokes rather than of his seductive practice. The notion that he was 'pathologically discreet' in his love-affairs (p. xii) sits uneasily with Goncourt's record of Maupassant's virile exploits in public, but that 'he enjoyed masculine pursuits and feminine company, sometimes to excess' is not in doubt. There remains a profoundly unattractive side to Maupassant which implicates us in his manipulative techniques and compelling representations of passivity. 491 FITZWILLIAM COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE ROBERT LETHBRIDGE</page></plain_text>
