<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Republic of Beavers: An American Utopia ARNOLD L. KERSON Frank and Fritzie Manuel, in their encyclopedic work, Utopian Thought in the Western World, on the subject of eighteenth-century utopias, note that one is struck by the absence in the Encyclop?die of an article on "utopia." Moreover, there is no entry on Thomas More, no reference to Francis Bacon's New Atlantis, or Campanula's City of the Sun. Also according to the Manuels, none of the great philosophes actually wrote a "proper utopia," although in their works there are "... Utopian excursions whose intent, when probed, appear to be rather ambiguous." In spite of this, they do admit that the Uto pian mode "... as surely part of the world outlook of the age" and mani fested itself among the great thinkers of the Enlightenment, such as Diderot, Rousseau, Turgot, and Condorcet, albeit in very distinct ways (413, 414). The Manuels have stated that, in spite of a few Utopian manifestations, "... Spain was relatively untouched by the Utopian main current until the penetration of Marxist and anarchist thought" (15). Beatriz Pastor, in her recent extensive study on Utopian thought in Latin America, which covers the period 1492-1695, concedes that in the Spanish American colonies there was no utopia in the traditional sense of the term. Nevertheless, and con trary to the Manuels' implication, in many of the writers and participants of the conquest and colonization of Spanish America, one finds a clear articu lation of the Utopian vision, examples of which I shall later point out (Pastor 12-13).1 Although certain aspects of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment met opposition in the Spanish colonies, it also produced a significant impact on many of its thinkers, scientists, and writers.2 One intellectual clearly influ enced by enlightened thought was Rafael Landivar who, I believe, repre sents an extension of those individuals of whom Beatriz Pastor speaks as articulating a "Utopian vision." Specifically, my theme deals with the sug gestion of a kind of Utopian society, expressed poetically and metaphori cally in terms of the community of beavers. This "utopia" occurs as Book 6 of Rafael Landivar's Neo-Latin poem Rusticatio Mexicana,3 which might be translated as "Mexican Agriculture," or "Mexican Country Life," although it includes topics, such as the book on beavers, that go beyond the sphere of agriculture and country life. Beavers, in the time of Landivar, were of great economic importance because of their meat, pelts, fur, and castoreum. Although the author treats this aspect, as well as the physical features of this</page><page sequence="2">The Republic of Beavers 15 unique rodent and the means of hunting and trapping it, what stands out in particular is the way in which the poet stresses their unusual talents and similarity to humans.

Ignacio Gil Alonso, S.J., in his unpublished dissertation, "La Rus ticatio Mexicana de Rafael Landivar," in commenting on Book 6, at most suggests that Landivar "humanizes" beaver society: "... resalta el intento de idealizar el instinto, ciertamente maravilloso de los castores, acerc?ndolo a la organizaci?n de las instituciones humanas ..." (85), [". . . there stands out the intention of idealizing the instinct, indeed wonderftil, of the beavers, likening it to the organization of human institutions . . ."].4 Juan M. Her n?ndez, S.J., considers the book on the beavers the most interesting and most perfectly constructed of the entire poem. He only sees as Landivar's model Virgil's bees (the subject of the fourth Ge?rgie), which, as the beavers, live in a perfect republic (59). Guido Mancini Giancarlo finds that Book 6, compared with the Rusticatio as a whole, contains the most inti mate poetry of nature. He is impressed with the nearly human description of the beavers. The life of these animals, "... tan solerte y casi humana, tiene algo asombroso, y Landivar la contempla sin comentar, con admiraci?n muda.... Es la poes?a de la bondad, de los m?s simples y nobles sen timientos ..." (804), [". . . so wise and almost human, is quite amazing, and Landivar observes it without commentary, with mute admiration.... It is the poetry of kindness, of the most basic and noble feelings . . . "]. I agree with Mancini's perceptive remarks as to the poet's sensitivity in Book 6. Yet, it is not exact to say that Landivar observes without comment. By very direct implication, the poet identifies with the beavers, describing their activities as examples of moral superiority over their human counterparts. However, Jos? Mata Gavidia goes much further than these three critics in his introduction to the 1950 facsimile of the Bologna edition. He refers to Book 6 concretely as the expression of a Utopian theory, in which there is freedom, peace, and the division of labor in a collective society. His com mentary is essentially a summary of the communal and "utopian" aspects of the book on beavers, with ample quotes from the text. Although there is no attempt made to identify concrete sources, Mata Gavidia indicates that Landivar has tried, in an eloquent manner, to create a new Utopia, New Atlantis, and City of the Sun, founded on love of the countryside and human virtue, both being the mainstays of tranquillity and happiness (73-77). Rafael Landivar y Caballero, born in Guatemala in 1731, was an impor tant member of a select group of Mexican Jesuit Latinists and humanists, which included such eminent figures as Francisco Javier Alegre, Diego Jos? Abad, Francisco Javier Clavijero, and Jos? Rafael Campoy, who distin guished themselves as teachers, historians, theologians, philosophers, and men of letters. These men were formed intellectually in a period of transi tion, in which traditional scholasticism was being challenged by modern philosophy. They were familiar with the works of Descartes, Newton, Locke, Leibniz, and Gassendi, among others, and many of them espoused the aprioris tic physics of the principia as well as the trend of Newtonian experimentalism.</page><page sequence="4">The Republic of Beavers 17 They were, therefore, forced in part either to yield or adapt themselves to the new rationalistic and experimental currents. The fondness of these authors for the Greco-Latin classics has a threefold explanation: the humanistic tra dition, reaffirmed in the eighteenth century by neoclassicism, the teaching tradition of the Jesuits, and the category of Latin as the official language of the Roman Catholic Church. Landivar, of noble lineage, was provided with a solid education in the humanistic tradition.5 After receiving his doctorate in Philosophy from the Universidad de San Carlos in Guatemala in 1747, he entered the prestigious Jesuit Colegio M?ximo de San Pedro y San Pablo in Mexico City in 1749, with the idea of becoming a priest. Ordained in 1755, he later became a teacher of rhetoric and philosophy. The lack of data leaves many lacunae regarding Landivar's activities from this period until the time of the exile. We know, however, that at one point he returned to his native Guatemala, and appears as "rector," or president of the Colegio de San Francisco de Borja where he had once been a student. Exiled with his fellow Jesuits by the decree of Charles III of Spain in 1767, he eventually settled in Bologna in the following year. Bologna at this time was a center of much intellectual activity. Among many distinguished scholars there one may mention Luigi Galvani (1739-98), noted physician and professor of anatomy, who experi mented with animal electricity, and Laura Bassi (1711-80), a professor of Greek and mathematics who also taught the natural sciences and experimen tal physics. It was here where many of the most accomplished Spanish and Spanish American Jesuit comrades-in-exile, theologians, philosophers, his torians, scientists, and men of letters established residence. Father F?lix Sebasti?n (See note 5) informs us that Landivar was placed in charge of a house of study, where he dedicated the remainder of his life to the teaching of young ex-Jesuits, and to religious study and devotion. In this establish ment, which came to be known as the "Sedes Sapientiae," or "House of Wisdom," he conducted classes in the arts and sciences. Father Sebasti?n depicts Landivar as extremely devout, studious, intelligent, affectionate, although withdrawn and, at times, quite morbid. With much free time on his hands, and feeling a deep sense of nostalgia for Guatemala and Mexico, both of which formed part of New Spain at that time, he decided to console himself by composing in Latin hexameter verse the Rusticatio Mexicana, virtually his only literary work (P?rez 30).6 Landivar died in Bologna in 1793, of an unidentified illness, and was buried in the Church of Santa Maria delle Muratelle. It was not until 1950, through the sustained efforts of both Italians and Guatemalans, that his remains were returned to Guatemala, and the poet was honored as a national hero. Rafael Landivar's Rusticatio Mexicana, a didactic poem which has seen four translations in Spanish and one in English, is generally acknowledged to be the best descriptive poem of eighteenth-century Spanish American lit erature in both Latin and Spanish.7 This work, in 15 books and an appendix, is a proud affirmation of the natural beauty and mineral wealth of rural America, of the abundance and quality of its agricultural products and live</page><page sequence="5">18 UTOPIAN STUDIES stock, and the industrial skill and recreational distractions of its inhabitants. It is thus seen, as I have noted, that the content of the poem goes beyond what its title, Rusticatio Mexicana, suggests. In his "Monitum" ( ), ["For ward"] the poet informs the reader that he relates what he has personally observed, what eye-witnesses have reported, and what he has derived from trustworthy authorities on the various subjects dealt with, a clear indication of the realistic, or "scientific" intent of the author. One of the most unusual books of the Rusticatio is Book 6, "Fibri" ["Beavers"], which may have been inspired by Book 14, "Apes," ["Bees"], and Book 13, "Columbae" ["Doves"] of the Praedium Rusticum [The Coun try Estate], a long descriptive Latin poem on agriculture, by the French Jesuit Jacques Vani?re (1664-1739), often referred to as "the Virgil of France."8 Another possible inspiration is the fourth Ge?rgie of Virgil, which deals with beekeeping, the life of the bees, their social organization, and common goal. In this particular context, the ordered society of the bees may be interpreted as a metaphor for the stability, order, and progress that the emperor Augustus brought to the Roman people under his Pax Romana. In the collective society that the French Jesuit poet Vani?re describes, there is no private wealth and no state authority. Each bee dedicates itself to the task it prefers, and in place of greed and hatred, there is generosity and love, as in the case of Landivar's beavers (258). It is significant that Vani?re ends the book on bees with a description of the famous Guaran? community of Indians founded by the Jesuits in Paraguay in the early seventeenth century (273-76), and which Mariano Pic?n Salas calls "... la extra?a utop?a social de los jesu?tas en los bosques del Paraguay" (68), [". . . the strange social utopia of the Jesuits in the forests of Paraguay"]. (For the history of the Jesuit experiment in Paraguay, see Lugon.) As for Vani?re's doves who live in the wild, unlike their comrades-in-captivity, there is peaceful coexis tence, with the conspicuous absence of "proceres" ["nobles"] and "tyrannis" ["absolute rulers"] (248). Besides the influence that Virgil and Vani?re appear to have had on Book 6 on the beavers, Landivar gives evidence that he took much of his data from the article on the beaver from Jacques-Christophe Valmont de Bomare's Dictionnaire raisonn? universel d'histoire naturelle.9 Valmont, for his article on the beaver (vol. 3), and by his own admission, relied heav ily on the article on the same subject in Georges-Louis Ledere Buffon's Histoire naturelle, g?n?rale et particuli?re, the most highly regarded edition of which, in 44 volumes, was printed in Paris between 1749 and 1804.10 The impression that Buffon and Valmont de Bomare give of the beavers, which they never observed personally in the wild, is anthropomorphic, and sug gests that these animals, just as humans, can only function as a community based on love, peace, and altruistic cooperation. It is evident that Buffon's article on the beaver is the result of an appre ciable amount of research, with references to first-hand observers of beaver colonies in North America. He evaluates their findings with a critical eye, rejecting certain impressions as fantastic and absurd, such as the affirmation</page><page sequence="6">The Republic of Beavers 19 that the beavers elect a president, that each colony has a commissioner or chief officer, and that sentinels are appointed to protect the public (8. 299). He does speak of a beaver brought to him from Canada, which he observed to be docile, a bit sad (little wonder!), but that obviously loved freedom, evidenced by the way it continually gnawed on the bars of its cage (8. 287). Valmont de Bomare, who acknowledges his debt to Buffon, "ce sub lime Ecrivain" ["that sublime writer"], states that in the animal kingdom the beaver, as regards intelligence, in one respect, is second only to humans. He writes, following Buffon word for word: Les castors son peut-?tre le seul exemple qui subsiste comme un ancien monu ment de cette esp?ce d'intelligence des brutes, qui, quoique infiniment inf?rieure par son principe ? celle de l'homme, suppose cependant des projets communs et des v?es relatives; projets qui ayant pour base la soci?t?, et pour objet une digue ? construire, une bourgade ? ?lever, une esp?ce de r?publique ? fonder, supposent aussi une mani?re quelconque de s'entendre et d'agir de concert. (Valmont 460; Buffon 283) Beavers are perhaps the only example that continues as a relic from the past of that kind of intelligence of brutes which, although infinitely inferior by their origin to that of humankind, does imply, nevertheless, common projects and related goals; projects which, having as a basis society and as an objective a dam to construct, a village to set up, a kind of republic to found, suppose also some sort of manner of mutual understanding and joint collaboration. Closely following Buffon, whom he mentions by name six times, Valmont de Bomare concludes that the genius and talent of the beaver can only be realized as the result of communal living, not unlike its human counterpart. In the case of Landivar, it becomes apparent that the poet, through the beavers, is indirectly setting forth a theory or vision of the ideal society.11 Book 6, "Fibri," begins with the classical formula of invoking a deity who should give inspiration to the poet. Landivar calls upon Diana, the god dess associated with woodlands, women, and childbirth. This invocation is perfunctory and purely ornamental, for the poet himself, no doubt to avoid censure, disavows the power of the pagan gods, references to whom, in his poem, are minimal. Landivar alludes to the vastness of America, and citing Valmont de Bomare, places the zone of beavers to the north, between 30 and 60 degrees latitude, a detail which reflects the scientific and encyclope dic character of the period. The beavers are presented as not very attractive physically, but highly intelligent, noble, peace-loving, devoid of hatred and revenge, without great concerns, and joyful in their labor. The dramatic scene of the toiling of the "eager beavers" is reminiscent of Virgil's descrip tion in th?Aeneid of the Tyrians in the process of building Carthage: Instant ardentes Tyrii, pars ducere muros molirique arcem et manibus subvolvere saxa, pars optare locum tecto et concludere sulco. (1. 423-25) The Tyrians work in earnest, some to erect the city walls, build a fortress, arid roll up rocks with their hands; others choose a site for a building, and trace its boundaries with a furrow.</page><page sequence="7">20 UTOPIAN STUDIES And in Landivar: Pars findunt teretes frondoso littore truncos, pars lentos caedit viridanti ex ilice ramos, et pars argillae c?mulos humentis acervat. (91-93) Some cleave the smooth trunks on the leafy shore, some cut stubborn branches from a green oak, while others heap up piles of moist clay. Figure 2.

(Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University.)</page><page sequence="8">The Republic of Beavers 21 They construct their "houses" with the precision of engineers, and although they work collectively, each one preserves its individuality, selecting the house that best suits it.12 They also have an aesthetic sense, which is dis played by the way in which they plaster mud on the walls of the house with their broad, flat tails serving as trowels, and then adorn it artistically with foliage. In a hyperbolic simile the poet claims that although the walls of the rich and powerful may be adorned with silks, and the ceilings embossed with gold and silver, they cannot be compared with the houses of the bea vers, "nitido gens inclyta cultu" (181), ["a species noted for its refined man ners"].13 This does not seem to be a mere rhetorical figure, for throughout the poem, Landivar shows disdain for material wealth, while at the same time a profound reverence for nature.14 Twice the poet employs the term res publica to signify the community of beavers, and notes that there exists the division of labor and a strong communal spirit among them. Overtired workers are gladly replaced by solicitous comrades (This fact is borne out by modern investigators), and the young care for the elderly. (This has never been proven, but there is clear evidence that beaver orphans are often adopted by the females.) In preparation for winter shortages, they store ample foodstuffs destined for communal use. There is a remarkable similarity between Jacques Vani?re's description of the communal system of the bees and that of Landivar's beavers. Says the French poet: Privataeque rei studio ne publica damnum res, ut in humana patiatur gente, reponit in commune cibos; venturae provida brumae, quos aestate legit: populum coalescit in unum quo neque justitiae, nec amantior ordinis alter. (14. 258) And so that the republic not suffer harm coveting private wealth, as is the case with the human species, and keeping in mind the approaching winter, [each bee] places the food that it has gathered in the summer, in a collective storehouse. They become one people, and no one loves justice and order more than they. And in Landivar: Ut vero finem tectis posuere superbis, privatae studio vitae nudata caterva tota sodalitio rursus se prompta r?sign?t. Praenoscit luces, mensesque experta futuros, h?rrida queis campos d?vast?t frigore bruma. (195-99) Turba dein complet dapibus de robore sectis horrea vasta domus socio fabricata labore, ordineque arb?reas epulas insomnis acervat, aptius ut socii lucorum frusta r?sumant. (214-17)</page><page sequence="9">22 UTOPIAN STUDIES And when [the beavers] have finished their elegant houses, having lost their desire for privacy, they soon once again adapt to a collective life. By experience, they sense the coming of the days and months in which harsh winter ravages the fields with frost. [.] They then fill with branches and bark the great storehouse built as a collective enterprise, and giving up sleep, they arrange the food neatly, so that their comrades may have easy access to the gathered food. Landivar next emphasizes their idyllic life, in which there is virtually no theft, vengeance, or strife, only harmony, love, and tranquillity: Nulla domos unquam praeceps discordia miscet, nulla movet pravas contentio t?rbida lites, nec foedis unquam spoliantur tecta rapinis; sed cives alma tranquilli pace fruuntur. (234-37) No impetuous discord ever invades their homes, no disorderly dispute moves them to ugly quarrels. Their homes are never plundered by despicable robbery, but rather these tranquil citizens enjoy nuturing peace.15 These industrious animals also have their pastimes or diversions, a relief from hard labor, something that certainly cannot be absent in the ideal republic, and Landivar describes this aspect with grace and wit: Nunc siquidem patulis effundit membra fenestris, jucundasque capit, Zephyris halantibus, auras, nunc g?lidas fluvii postica immergit in undas membra cohors, ulnasque fenestrae in limine ponit. Sic ignava diu pubes operosa laborem praeteritum sarcit, limphisque r?frig?r?t artus. (246-51) Now indeed [the beavers] expose their bodies to the open balconies, thus catching the gentle breezes. They then lower their hindquarters into the icy stream, while clinging to the sill with their forelegs. In this way, the hardworking young animals, by resting a long time, make up for their past toil, and refresh their limbs in the limpid waters.16 The arrival of spring is a motive of great rejoicing, and the poet speaks of mating time and the maternal instincts. The depiction of the baby beavers, or kits, frolicking about and following their mothers is tender and human. The conduct of the father, however, is cause for censure: Tune sociata nova genetrix suavissima prole sedula vernantes, legio ceu caetera, lucos advolat, et crustas truncorum pascitur udas. Impiger at genitor, simul ac vernantia flore prata novo rident, tectis se surripit altis crudelisque domi sobolem cum matre relinquit. (261-66)</page><page sequence="10">The Republic of Beavers 23 Then the tender mother, accompanied by her brood, along with the whole community, eagerly runs to the green forest to dine upon the juicy barks of the trees. But the invigorated father, as soon as the meadows smile with new flowers, scampers away from his splendid house, and thoughtlessly leaves the kits at home with their mother. This vision of the carefree and inconsiderate males comes from Valmont de Bomare by way of Buffon. However, current belief among naturalists is that the females prefer that the males absent themselves during this period.17 Whatever the reason, in reality, the males, rather than just enjoying leisure, return frequently to repair and make additions to the dam (Hilfiker 37). Although beaver society is "natural" and nearly perfect, there are, in effect, some antisocial individuals, such as thieves, as is the case in other utopias. For these, the punishment is exile. This becomes a life of desolation and pain. The exile cannot build a house on a riverbank, for it surely would be discovered, and so it is condemned to inhabit the holes, or burrows found along the banks of rivers and streams.18 The poet remarks that these outcasts "... vitam degit nigris exterris in umbris" (283), [". . . live the life of exiles among dark shadows"]. This seems to be a veiled allusion to the suffering that Landivar underwent as an exile in Italy, and which is expressed more directly with a degree of deep sorrow in several other parts of the Rusticatio.19 Related to the idea of forced exile is the precious gift of free dom, clearly expressed in book 6. The beaver, says the poet, has inherited "ingenuos . . . mores" ["noble traits"], harbors no hate, provokes no one, never seeks revenge, and is content with a modest existence. But the one thing it cannot endure is the loss of freedom (41-45). Filled with emotion are the following verses that undoubtedly refer to Landivar's limited life in Bologna. The poet thus describes the reaction of a trapped beaver: Ac nisi libertas pretioso tangat honore, nulla fibrum poterit curae prosternere moles. Ast si ferratis captivum dextra catenis vinciat, aut cavea servet violenta retentum, protinus ingenti transfixus corda dolore angitur, et querulis caveam clamoribus implet: nec prius a tanto cessabit bellua fletu, quam notos repetat praerupto carcere lucos. (47-54) No sea of troubles can break the spirit of the beaver, unless they affect that priceless glory we call freedom. But if one were to bind a captured [animal] with iron chains, or forceably keep it locked in a cage, it is at once overcome by pain and stress, and fills the cage with plaintive cries. Nor will this creature cease its constant wailing, until it breaks out of its prison and returns to its familar territory. Unfortunately, the idyllic situation of the beavers cannot last. The poet lists the natural enemies of this noble animal, such as wolves and bears.</page><page sequence="11">24 UTOPIAN STUDIES However, the worst of all is "violens homo" ["violent man"]. In effect, the hunt for beaver pelts began early in the history of North America. In 1763, for example, Thomas Bewick reports that the Hudson's Bay Company sold 54,670 beaver skins at one sale (419). Actually, for a period of about 200 years, thanks to the vast demand for beaver pelts and castoreum, many areas of Canada and the present United States were populated, and, indeed, the prosperity of the New England states is attributed to the beaver trade.20 At this point, as in other parts of his poem, Landivar introduces the theme of violence and destruction. In what becomes a miniature mock epic in the Virgilian style, the entire community of beavers is terror-stricken as they sense the approach of hunters. With their keen ears attuned, they splash the water with their wide tails in order to warn their comrades. Although they make every effort to escape, they cannot outwit the hunters' brutal methods, unspeakable to a sensitive human being, and described with a nat uralistic realism. It is not evident from what source Landivar culled his information for the rather long account of the hunting and trapping of beavers (316-60); neither Buffon nor Valmont de Bomare deal with this aspect. In a simile in the Virgilian tradition, he clearly indicates his revul sion toward the hunter's tactics, which consists of placing a tasty morsel as bait, and then clubbing and slitting the throat of the hapless creature: Qualis ubi numi d?mens aconita noverca pr?par?t in cyatho, cyathumque urbana propinat; Illa dolum potat, tantique ignara perieli funus inexpletis d?glutit faucibus atrum. Non aliter falso decepti mu?ere fibri tranquillam mutant violento funere vit?m. (347-52) It is as a crazed mother-in-law, who prepares poison in a goblet, and graciously offers it to her daughter-in-law, and the latter, unaware of the deceitful potion, swallows savoringly the black death. In like manner the beavers, deceived by the treacherous "gift," exchange their tranquil lives for violent death. And so this entire admirable Utopian republic, consisting of the most highly esteemed, hard-working architects and engineers of the animal kingdom, threatening no one and desirous only of living in peace, ends up as so many pairs of hats, elegant boots, and castoreum for the production of medicine. This ironic observation is accompanied by a deep sense of compassion on the part of the poet. It occurs to one that while humans seemingly make impossible the realization of their own utopias, the beavers' utopia is thwarted by humans. What are the conclusions to be reached concerning Book 6 of the Rusti catio Mexicana? The poet, a product of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, relies on two of the most respected contemporary scientific authorities on the subject, namely Buffon and Valmont de Bomare. However, the descrip tions of these two naturalists do not derive from direct observation or neces sarily accurate information, but are based in great part on reports of hunters,</page><page sequence="12">The Republic of Beavers 25 Indians, and Europeans, mainly from Canada. The picture that Buffon and Valmont, who takes freely from the former, as we have seen, portray, is very much in accord with eighteenth-century perception, when they speak of repub lics, societies, communal efforts, tribes, villages, storehouses, great public works, punishment by exile, and artistic sensibility. Although there is a basis of truth in this perception, it becomes exaggeratingly anthropomorphic, romanticized, and in some aspects, simply erroneous. In defense of Buffon, however, it should be pointed out that he mentions and rejects reports that affirm that these animals have a police system, a president and chief offi cers, hold councils of state, and when pursued by hunters deliberately muti late themselves. Indeed, Bewick, who acknowledges Buffon as one of his sources, admiringly speaks of the beavers as "The most industrious of ani mals," whose "labors seem the result of a social compact, formed for mutual convenience, preservation, and support." They live in communities, choose an overseer, "whose orders are punctually obeyed," and who "smartly" strikes the water with his tail to warn the community of impending danger from an enemy (417-18). This last notion, still held by some, is rejected by most experts. In the words of the Canadian naturalist, R.D. Lawrence, Many of the writings of the early settlers that I had read suggested that they were awed by Castor's amazing skills and that they believed the animal pos sessed almost human intellect, opinions that were no doubt influenced by Indian legends.... [M]y own experiences with beaver have convinced me that this animal has far more intelligence than it is being given credit for and far less than it was credited with by the early settlers. (179-80) At any rate, Landivar, as a poet, humanizes the beavers by relying on both fact and myth. What we have here, by implication, is a visionary view?it cannot be termed a specific "plan"?for an idealized communal society. There inevitably come to mind the classical utopias, especially those that emphasize a communistic form of society, such as Plato's Republic (c. 365 BC), Thomas More's Utopia (1516), Tommaso Campanula's Civitas Solis (City of the Sun) (1623), Denis Vairasse's Histoire des Sevarambes (History of the Sevarambians) (1675-79), and Morelly's Code de la Nature (Law of Nature) (1755). In these utopias, peace and harmony are basic goals, and efforts are made to avoid hatred, jealousy, and vengeance. Communal coop eration is stressed, there is distribution of labor, and the young respect and care for the elderly. For the antisocial and envious individuals, there is the punishment of exile. It is noteworthy that this vision of the communal state and personal liberty belongs to that great current of ideas related to the theo ries of social equality, in organizations ruled by just laws and governments, expressed by such Enlightenment thinkers, or philosophes as Rousseau, Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Mably. One finds in the Rusticatio Mexicana other themes reminiscent of the Enlightenment, such as practical matters concerning the economy, various types of agricultural and production pro cedures, a classification and description of livestock, and a kind of catalog of birds and other wildlife. Much of what Landivar deals with is related to the concept of the improvement of society.</page><page sequence="13">26 UTOPIAN STUDIES The final lines of the Rusticatio, the vision of which coincides with that of a select group of Landivar's fellow comrades-in-exile, who, in the spirit of the Enlightenment, worked for the propagation of modern science and the reform of scholastic philosophy in the Spanish-speaking world, are directed at the youth of America: Disce tuas magni felices pendere terras, divitiasque agri, praestantia mu?era coeli, explorare animo, ac longum indagere tuendo. Alter inauratos Phoebo lumine campos incautis oculis, brutorum more, sequatur, omniaque ignavus consum?t tempora lud?s. Tu tamen interea, magnum cui mentis acumen antiquos exuta, novos nunc indue sensus, et reserare sagax naturae arcana professa ingenii totas vestigans exere vires, thesaurosque tuos grato recludere labore. (Appendix 102-13) Learn to prize highly your fertile lands, to study with resolve the wealth of the fields and the excellent gifts of heaven by the use of reason and careful observation. Let others in the manner of brutes, walk with heedless eyes through the fields made golden with sunlight, and let them squander their time on idle pleasures. But you, however, who have a keen mind, cast aside outdated notions and take on new ones, and wisely endeavoring to unlock the mysteries of nature with all your mental capabilities, uncover your treasures with rewarding hard work. Finally, there is no concrete evidence as to what Utopian writers, if any, served directly or indirectly as inspiration for the republic of beavers. How ever, substantial evidence indicates that Landivar and many of his Jesuit companions were familiar with the principal writers of the Enlightenment. We may assume that he knew More's Utopia, the influence of which was strongly felt in New Spain, as well as such works as Campanula's City of the Sun. And as has been demonstrated, he utilized Buffon through Valmont de Bomare, as well as Vani?re, all products of the Enlightenment, who were highly regarded in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In our time, however, Buffon "... has slipped to the status of a minor figure" (Fellows and Milliken 16), and Vani?re is virtually unknown, a fate he shares with Valmont de Bomare. In any case, the spirit of the eighteenth century Utopian mode is definitely present in "Fibri," book 6, on beavers, of the Rusticatio Mexicana, a Latin work which, because of its American, or criollo subject-matter, has become a classic of Spanish American literature, as is evidenced by an impressive corpus of critical and analytical books and articles. Although it was not Landivar's intention to participate in the dis pute, initiated by the Mexican Jesuit, Francisco Javier Clavijero, the first modern historian of Mexico (See Ronan, ch. 5) to refute the allegations by</page><page sequence="14">The Republic of Beavers 27 such writers as Buffon, De Pauw, and Raynal, that America was, with respect to its climate, flora and fauna, as well as human inhabitants, an infe rior continent, the Rusticatio has been cited as an example of this refuta tion.21 In effect, supported by Father Sebasti?n's observation, which was alluded to previously, Guiseppe Bellini writes: "La Rusticatio Mexicana es, sin duda, una obra que no se hubiera escrito de no haber sido por las desventuras de su autor; habr?a faltado el motivo principal, de naturaleza exquisitamente sentimental" (197-98), ["The Rusticatio Mexicana is, with out doubt, a work that would not have been written were it not for the ill fortune of its author; there would have been missing the main motive, of an exquisitely sentimental nature"]. As an afterthought, the question arises, if Landivar wished to recall with nostalgia the natural beauty, and the industry and activities of the people of New Spain, why did he choose to write of the beavers, who, al though found in some parts of northern Mexico, are identified with Canada and the northern parts of the United States? Part of the answer may lie in the fact that beavers, because of their unique engineering skills as well as paradigms of communal living, have always intrigued and fascinated mem bers of the human race, in spite of the fact these same humans have nearly succeeded in bringing about the extinction of these industrious animals. Indeed, it was the great Buffon himself who wistfully remarked, upon com menting on the beavers' aversion to killing and strife, "... ils jouissent de tous les bien que l'homme ne sait que d?sirer" (294), [". . . they enjoy all the good things that Man is only able to wish for"]. Bees and ants tradition ally have served in literature as examples of well-organized societies. But Landivar was in fact describing an animal basically identified with Amer ica, and used it in an original and unique way, bringing to mind the concept of utopia, a detail that has gone unnoticed by the scholars of the eighteenth century Latin literature of New Spain, with the exception of Jos? Mata Gavidia. It appears certain that without the articles on the beaver by Buffon and Valmont de Bomare, Landivar could not have produced his "beaver utopia." Book 6, in effect, is a fine example of a successful depiction of an aspect of American nature converted into drama by the humanization of ani mals, with scenes of mounting tension and comic-heroic elements, as well as for the compassion it conveys, revealing a certain tragic sense of life that applies to beavers and humans alike. Tragic, perhaps, because the term "utopian," like "quixotic," is used to define an impractical or impossible dream. Since the beaver resembles us humans with regard to its collectivis tic and communal social habits, as well as its ability to create its own pro tective environment, it was most appropriate that Landivar used it to express a vision in a land that, with the arrival of certain idealistic Europeans, the product of Renaissance humanism, would become the logical place for a utopia that, rather than a dream, would be a reality. The admiration and enthusiasm for the remarkable beaver has not diminished since the Enlightenment period. To cite only one example, I feel compelled to close with Enos Mill's words, which express a sentiment not</page><page sequence="15">28 UTOPIAN STUDIES unlike that of Buffon's quoted just above, for no greater tribute could be rendered to castor: "If Mother Nature should ever call me to live upon another planet, I could wish that I might be born a beaver, to inhabit a house in the water" (16). NOTES 1. As an epigraph to El jard?n y el peregrino, Pastor cites these significant words of the Uruguayan writer, Angel Rama: "No es posible ser latinoamericano sin tener una viva con ciencia utopica" (9), ["It is not possible to be a Latin American without having an intense Utopian conscience"]. 2. See Lanning (1942) and Whitaker (1971). 3. Originally consisting of ten books, the Rusticado Mexicana first appeared in Modena, Italy, in 1781. The second and definitive version, revised and expanded to 15 books and an appendix, was published in Bologna, in 1782. It is this second version that serves as the basis for my study. See REFERENCES for the complete bibliographical data of these editions. 4. All translations from Spanish, Latin, and French are my own. 5. There exists only scanty biographical information on Landivar, and one has virtually only two main sources on which to rely. One, Villacorta, provides statistical data on his lineage, and recreates the background and atmosphere of the Guatemala in which he lived. The other source is a brief biographical sketch, which forms part of an unpublished work by Father F?lix Sebasti?n, a contemporary of Landivar, on members of the Company of Jesus exiled to Italy. This second source is invaluable, for it provides an insight into the character of Landivar and the circumstances accompanying the writing of the poem. This sketch is contained in a hand written manuscript under the title, "Memorias de los Padres, y Hermanos de la Compa??a de Jes?s de la Provincia de Nueva Espa?a Difuntos despu?s del arresto acaecido en la capital de M?xico el dia 25 de Junio del a?o 1767" ["Memories of the (recently) deceased Fathers and Brothers of the Company of Jesus since their arrest occurring in Mexico City on June 25, in the year of 1767"], in two volumes. Father Manuel I. P?rez discovered this manuscript in the library of the Archiginnasio of Bologna, and published the biographical sketch of Landivar from vol. 2: 242-55. 6. Landivar's other literary pieces consist basically of a funeral oration and two short poems, one in Latin and the other in Spanish. 7. See REFERENCES for a complete listing of the translations. 8. The Praedium Rusticum of Vani?re reflects the enthusiasm in the eighteenth century for the didactic poem of the countryside. The first version of this work, in 10 books, was pub lished in Paris in 1696. The poem was expanded to 16 books in the 1730 Toulouse edition, and saw numerous editions throughout the eighteenth century. (For this study, I have utilized the 1756 Paris edition.) On the title page of the Rusticatio, Landivar quotes from Book 1 of the Praedium Rus ticum the following lines: Secreti tacita capior dulcedine ruris: quod spedare juvat, placuit deducere verso. 1.21-22 I am enchanted by the still sweetness of the solitary countryside. I love to look upon it, and am happy to describe it in verse. Also, in Book 13, "Aves" ["Birds"], the Guatemalan poet offers this tribute to Vani?re:</page><page sequence="16">The Republic of Beavers 29 Quis tarnen has memoret, postquam Vanierius omnes providus implevit mu?ere chortes, Aoniamque tulit, Phaebo plaudente, coronam? (23-25) Yet, who needs to relate these matters (i.e., the description of poultry), inasmuch as the gifted Vani?re has filled the barnyards with his priceless talent, and has won the crown of poet with the enthusiasm of Apollo? 9. Five editions of this work appeared between 1765 and 1800. The fourth and fifth, consist ing of 15 volumes, were published in Lyon. For this study, I have utilized the 1791 edition. Although Valmont de Bomare produced no original work, he was highly admired in the eigh teenth century as a great popularizer of natural history. However, the nineteenth-century edi tion of the Grand Dictionnaire Universel Larousse has only a brief entry on this naturalist, while the twentieth-century edition eliminates him completely. 10. For this study I have utilized the article, "Le Castor," of volume 8 (1760) of this edition (282-332, followed by six engravings relating to the beaver and its anatomy). On page 62 of the Rusticatio, Landivar cites the following, indicating the source as Val mont de Bomare: "On trouve des Castors en Am?rique depuis le trenti?me degr? de latitude nord jusqu' au soixanti?me, et au del?" ["Beavers are found in America from the 30th degree latitude north to the 60th and beyond"]. This quotation is taken verbatim from Buffon. In the same note Landivar relates that he has heard of beavers being observed in New Mexico and northern California. Book 6, unlike the other books of the poem, is unique in that it represents an aspect not typical of Mexico or Guatemala, and one may logically conclude that the poet is using a natural science topic as a basis for a societal theory. Beavers, today, are very scarce in Mexico. In recent times, they have been observed "... in the Rio San Juan, near China, Nueva Le?n, in the R?o Salado of northern Nuevo Le?n, and in the R?o Sabinas of Eastern Coahuila" (Leopold 380). 11. We recall that Sir Thomas More, in his Utopia of 1516, located his ideal society in an unspecified place in America. The distinguished first bishop of Michoac?n, Don Vasco de Quiroga, inspired by More's Utopia, established two "pueblos-hospitales," that is, communi ties of collective life, one in Santa Fe, near Mexico City, and another in Micoac?n. Other sim ilar attempts were made by Fray Bartlom? de las Casas, referred to as the "Ap?stol de los Indios" and the "Protector de los Indios," who, according to Marcel Bataillon, with "pr?cision utopique" formed a plan in 1517 for an agrarian colony in Cuman?, Venezuela, which was established in 1519, and later, the Utopian community of Verapaz, in Guatemala, both of which, unfortunately, did not enjoy the successful results of Vasco de Quiroga's experiment, and actually ended in disaster (Bataillon 46; Men?ndez Pidal 37-45; 171-203). Quiroga expresses his ideas on the ideal Indian society in Informaci?n en Derecho, in Aguayo Spencer {Documentos 289-406). (For a commentary on this document, see Zavala.) "[Quiroga] was a consistently practical idealist and it was surely enough for him to have per formed the surprising feat of grafting the Christian socialism of Thomas More on the rustic Tarascan stock. His experiment of creating a modest Utopia by combining elements of two cul tures in a social and economic scheme had turned out to be a brilliant success" (Cheetham 199). 12. "The house the beaver builds is the best constructed that is built by any creature except man" (Hilfiker 11). 13. While Buffon says of the stuccoed walls, "... les paroits en sont rev?tues d'une esp?ce de stuc si bien g?ch? et si proprement appliqu?, qu'il semble que la main de l'homme y ait pass?" (292), [". . . the walls are covered up with a type of stucco so well cemented and so firmly applied, that it appears as if the hand of man has passed over it"]. Valmont de Bomare, taking freely from Buffon, goes a step further by adding the concept of "art" (art or skill), thus</page><page sequence="17">30 UTOPIAN STUDIES coming closer to Landivar's hyperbolic description of the "artistic aspect" of the beavers' houses, by remarking, "... les parois sont rev?tues d'une espece de stuc appliqu? ? l'aide de leur queue, avec tant de solidit? et de propret?, qu'on croiroit y reconnoitre l'art humain" (463), [". . . the walls are covered with a type of stucco applied with the help of their tails, with such firmness and neatness that you would think you were looking at human art"]. 14. In effect, Landivar rejected a substantial family inheritance, conceding it to a cousin, do?a Petrona Abaurrea, since he assumed that he would never return to America. See Villa corta 106. 15. Modern naturalists are in agreement that beavers rarely fight or attack, and when threat ened, opt to flee. "As animal life goes, that of the beaver stands among the best. He is home loving and avoids fighting" (Mills 15). 16. While Valmont follows nearly to the letter Buffon's description of this aspect of beaver life, he omits Buffon's significant remark that while the beavers take this "bath" out of neces sity, it is quite possible that they do it also for sheer pleasure: "Cet ?l?ment liquide leur est si n?cessaire, ou plust?t leur fait tant de plaisir, qu'ils semblent ne pouvoir s'en passer" (295), ["This watery element is very necessary to them, or rather it gives them so much pleasure that they seem unable to do without it"]. The fact that Landivar makes no allusion to Buffon's "pleasure theory" lends support to my suspicion that he did not have access to the latter's Histoire naturelle. According to Enos Mills, "... the beaver is a master of the fine art of rest. He has many a vacation and con serves his energy" (14-15). 17. This is one example of Fellows and Milliken's observation that "The scientific 'facts' that Buffon offers us in the Histoire Naturelle are . . . often wrong, sometimes even comically wrong, but this does not automatically invalidate the basic assumptions with which he approached them" (20). 18. Buffon and Valmont de Bomare designate these beavers as "castors terriers" ["burrow beavers"] and refer to them as "rejet?s" ["outcasts"] due to some "d?faut" ["deficiency"]. They do not, however, specify thievery, as does Landivar. 19. Normally, by the age of two, the young beavers, along with some aged ones, probably in order to conserve the food supply for those about to be born, are driven from the colony. These are designated as "batchelor beavers" (Hilfiker 43). It is also thought that some elderly beavers, weak and unable to contribute their labor, instinctively seek a life of isolation. 20. Castoreum is a bitter, strong-smelling substance derived from the dried perineal glands of the beaver, and is now used in the making of perfume. Buffon states that it is widely used as a medicine (305), and Valmont de Bomare writes that it is useful in some cases of hypochondria and histeria (466). 21. I am in disagreement with John Browning's assumption that one of the functions of the Rusticatio Mexicana was: "... to challenge scientifically the picture of the New World prop agated by Buffon, De Pauw and ..." (26). There is no hint in what is known of Landivar that he ever intentionally participated in any kind of polemic.
