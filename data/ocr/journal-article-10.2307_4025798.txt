<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHARLES LYELL AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE HISTORY OF GEOLOGY RoY PORTER* HISTORY iS the science which investigates the successive changes that have taken place in the material and intellectual conditions of man; it inquires into the causes of those changes, and the influence which they have exerted in modifying the life and mind of mankind.i Our job as historians at this conference is critically to reappraise Charles Lyell's place in the history of geology. The task is complex. For not only has the familiar account-I think of Ramsay and Geikie, Bonney, and Bailey-championed Lyell at the expense of his contempora- ries and opponents. But these encomia are essentially taken out of Lyell's own mouth, and, above all, from the historical tour de force which intro- duces his Principles of geology.2 For, true or false, fair or unfair, Lyell's autobiographical vision of himself as the spiritual saviour of geology, freeing the science from the old dispensation of Moses,3 has exercised an unbroken fascination over almost all who have struggled to unravel the history of British geology. Take any Victorian celebration of geology and you will find materials quarried verbatim out of Lyell, sometimes acknowledged, sometimes not.4 Even the omnivorous Whewell unashamedly wrote long passages of his History of the inductive sciences with only the early chapters of the Principles open in front of him.5 Look at the introductions of modern textbooks of geology. No less is it true of Charles Coulston Gillispie's Genesis and geologv and Thomas Kuhn's The structure of scientific revolutions, where Lyell's is the first paradigm in geological science. Lyell, one can be sure, would have heartily endorsed the evaluation of himself as geology's great and successful revolutionary, recently reconfirmed in the first volume of Leonard Wilson's monumental biography.6 Through nimble wit and stylish grace, Lyell conjured up an eminently usable past, which spoke with authority to his contemporaries and fol- lowers. He forged myths about his place in the geological pantheon. In this conference, however, we must not revere Lyell as the dilettante his prize ammonite, abstracting the beautiful specimen from its matrix and admiring it safely behind glass in the cabinet.7 We must examine Lyell in context of his place in the historical record, and recreate the economy of thought at the time of his own deposition. As Lyell strove to revolu- tionize the meaning of fossil and strata evidence,8 so perhaps we need to rethink our interpretation of the Lyellian historical record, and some * Churchill College, Cambridge CB3 oDS.

History is not to be con- founded with hagiography.9 The right place to start is with the mythic history of geology with which Lyell prefaced his Principles. What were the myths that Lyell created? How true are they? Lyell opened the struggle for the Principles with a pre-emptive tactical strike on the battlefield of history.Io The past was the key to the present. Rudwick has deftly argued how the 'history' was functional to the strategy of the Principles:." The aim of this section [he writes of the first four chapters] is not to provide historical background, but to argue a case as forcefully and per- suasively as possible. This so-called history of geology is a highly polemical tract for the times. To treat it as straight history would be to ignore the contemporary situation to which the book was addressed. Like many would-be reformers, Lyell tries to rewrite history to prove his own ante- cedents, and to demonstrate that his own approach is not an innovation but a return to the true path that geology should follow. Conversely, he argues that those whose present position he is attacking are also inheritors of an earlier tradition, but one that has had a retarding influence on the piogress of the science. To understand the polemical significance of Lyell's history involves con- trasting it with the received accounts of the science-its nature and history-in the period leading up to I830: the outlook of such as Buck- land, Conybeare, Fitton, and the major encyclopaedias.12 Like the rest of the Principles, it has a vision, a range, a show of premeditated design which elevate it above the crowd, and compel respect for Lyell's intelli- gence and craft. Other histories, though no British ones, were longer, and discussed more geologists: one should mention Desmarest, Brocchi, and, slightly later, Keferstein.'3 But alongside Lyell these shrivel to compilations. Lyell's account has a strategic comprehensiveness that is not found elsewhere till Humboldt's Kosmos and Whewell's History of the inductive sciences (which leans heavily, perhaps surprisingly so, on Lyell). Most British chroniclings of geology had concentrated chiefly on native science. Lyell strategically makes the entire world his parish. Almost all, British and foreign, had focused their attention on the eight- eenth and nineteenth centuries. Lyell's panorama, however, opens with savage society, and encompasses the ancient Hindoos and Egyptians before dwelling at some length on the Greeks, Romans, and Arabs. What is Lyell's purpose here? The majesty of the opening betokens the ambition of the whole. The classically educated liberal gentleman ennobles geology for his cosmopolitan cultured peers. But more is at stake. Lyell did not offer his Principles as just another brick in the edifice of positive geological knowledge. Hence he had no interest in establishing a niche for himself within the patient accumulation of stratigraphical, palaeontological, or mineralogical data. Rather, he thought himself offering-for the first time-the very principles of reasoning in the</page><page sequence="3">Charles Lyell and the Principles of the History of Geology 93 science.I4 His canvas then had to be the total world-history of consciousness about the earth, to show why millennia of thought had fallen short of the science of geology. In the guise of a cosmopolitan philosophe (albeit a fastidiously prudent one),'5 Lyell stepped back to contemplate the causes of error and folly, retardation and decay, as cycles of sub- and proto-geological thought wheeled through epochs, continents, and civilizations. His aim was to offer cautionary tales for the present. History revealed three persistent barriers to the emergence of geology as a science. First, distorted positive religion, with a monopolistic priesthood- jealous of freedom of learning, inculcating superstition, and feeding popular prejudice,i6 teaching bogus science from dogmatic holy books, and persecuting progressive thinkers-had been the foe of geology.'7 False views of the province of religion encouraged men's eyes to stray from the straight and narrow of actual geological causes towards chimeri- cal speculations about the creation and destruction of the world. This audience will need no explanation of how Lyell felt no tension between this attack and his own deep, Christian religious convictions.i8 But it is worth remembering that Lyell's indictment of the historical role of organized religion-amongst the Arabs, amongst Medieval Latin Christendom: a displaced if scarcely veiled attack upon his contemporaries -was more stinging than that of almost any other contemporary British geologist. It faithfully, if reticently, reflected his oft-expressed private anger at the clergy's intrusion into what he took to be the territory of science.' 9 The second lesson of history was that philosophy, though less stifling than positive religion, had also prevented geology's growth beyond a certain point. The Greeks, in particular, had reasoned with profundity about the economy of nature, about the power of actual causes to trans- form the earth, about former changes to the earth's surface. But philo- sophy remained for them a substitute for observation. Hence, Lyell's judgement upon them, and upon all other mere philosophers of the earth, was absolute and damning: 'The ancient history of the globe was to them a sealed book, and although written in characters of the most striking and imposing kind, they were unconscious even of its existence'.20 Thirdly, and encapsulating the two previous, humanistic concerns had caused geology to miscarry. For Lyell, so many theories of the earth had been scientifically useless because the earth had been conceived anthropocentrically and anthropomorphically. Man's hopes and fears, his pride and guilt, his thoughts about origins and destiny, had been projected onto the earth.2" All in all, the earth had been batted around like a shuttlecock between rival religious, philosophical, and moral groups. So history showed that the study of the earth needed to be freed from Moses; but also from philosophers, and from man, if ideology was ever</page><page sequence="4">94 RoY PORTER to yield to science. Lyell's historical foci and lessons are distinct from those of his generation in precisely the way, and to the same extent, as are the relations of God, man, nature, and time in his geology. In envisaging man as a rational and moral being entirely apart from the nature and history of the world, Lyell sought to preserve the dignity of man at the same time as freeing the earth for geological science.22 But Lyell's distinc- tion between man and geology was, however, formal and superficial-a defensive reflex, specifically to reading Lamarck. Right from I830 Lyell was trapped in that web of religious and humanistic projections upon the earth for which he was so eager to ridicule and rebuke others. The more he struggled, the more he was trapped. His own warnings came home to roost. Between the lines of his Species notebooks Lyell is writing: 'O my prophetic soul'.23 History, then, is the annals of error. But history, it is Lyell's purpose to show, is also on his side. For beyond these epiphenomenal aberrancies, the natural history of the human psyche was inevitably tending towards uniformitarian geology. Man moves from rudeness to refinement. His understanding advances from the terrified immediacy of imagination towards thought; from poetic credulity to critical reason; from the par- ticular to the general; from sensations to causes; from confusion to clarity; from subjectivity to objectivity; from a priori philosophy to induc- tive science; in his conceptions of time and space, from the closed world to the infinite universe.24 It is the mark-and, indeed, for Lyell, the vestige- of primitive thought to view the earth as an animistic theatre of penal catastrophes and providential miracles; random, sudden, and violent events out of the normal course of nature, imposed by an external agent. The primitive mind is imprisoned within an atavistic desire to contemplate Genesis. Thus does the infant mind of the race project human motives onto God, nature, and the earth, which it can only view through the distorting glass of the human here and now.25 Refined, civilized, progressive minds, however, are those which have reached the stage of appreciating the interconnected 'undeviating uni- formity of secondary causes', the gradualness, the continuity of nature, the subordination of all to 'fixed and invariable laws'.26 A true glorying in the autonomous sublime economy of nature marks the maturity of the race. Only the mature natural philospher has the courage to stare reso- lutely into a world of infinite space and time, and to admit squarely that man is not the sole end of existence.27 Lyell's move is a stroke of genius. He knew he was arguing against a geological tradition that had successfully appropriated to itself the orb of Moses and the sceptre of Baconian induction. Lyell had to trump these claims and stake out ground for himself. He made uniformitarianism seem natural and inevitable, by assimilating it within a conjectural evolution of the human mind. Lyell offered uniformitarianism not just</page><page sequence="5">Charles Lyell and the Principles of the History of Geology 95 as a methodology. It was unchallengeable because integral to the evolu- tionary epistemology of the human race. But Lyell was also waging his complex polemic with the present on the microcosmic, as well as on the macrocosmic, plane of history. This too must be examined, since it raises many issues that will be central debating points in this conference. Lyell openly admitted to Scrope that his ridicule of past geologists was a tactic to assail his rivals and opponents: 'if ever the Mosaic geology could be set down without giving offence, it would be in a historical sketch'.zS The device is transparent enough and requires little comment. More crucial for understanding Lyell, and more difficult, is tracing what Rudwick talked of as Lyell's rewriting 'history to prove his own antecedents, and to demonstrate that his own approach is not an innovation'.29 Of Lyell's private, indeed secret, conception of his intellectual debts and originality, I am in no position to speak.3o Lyell claimed: 'I have been very careful in my work in referring, where I have borrowed, to authors.'3' But contemporaries believed him frugal in acknowledgements -as for example William Fitton, who asserted in I839 that Lyell had done meagre justice to Hutton; and it is a trait on which recent historians have commented.32 Certainly Lyell's strategical silence about living geologists-'nor dare I come down to modern offenders'33 (the last geologists named are Werner, Hutton, and Smith)-might serve to convey to the casual reader the not unwelcome impression of Lyell as a beacon in the darkness. Furthermore, he had a compulsive habit of damning with faint praise those whom he does acknowledge as having been forerunners of Lyell. Lyell spread his golden syrup thinly. Pallas, Dolomieu, and de oaussure, for example, receive scant recognition.34 His acknowledgement of Hooke ends by asserting that Hooke's theory of a 'crisis in nature' was 'as extravagent and visionary as that of his most fanciful predecessors'.35 His praise for Moro (whose name he gets wrong throughout) 36 is tempered by pointing out the 'absurdity' of his theory of stratification, and noting the (for Lyell) cardinal sin of graceless prose style.37 Lyell grants the claims of Hutton as a great pioneer in geology, and asserts that his denial that geology is a science of origins 'will ultimately prevail'.38 Yet he spends over a page condemning Hutton's unphilosophical theories of the paroxysmal elevation of continents (a barb at Elie de Beaumont?) and of the chronological sequence of creation and decay (ideas, indeed, which Hutton never held but which are entirely the product of Lyell's mis- reading, or ignorance, of Hutton).39 Hutton also had an execrable style. 'Hutton laboured to give fixed principles', on the Newtonian model, 'to geology', writes Lyell, but failed because the time was not yet ripe.40 In fact, Lyell is not particularly concerned to show himself on a tide of progress in geology.4' His implicit account of contemporary</page><page sequence="6">96 RoY PORTER geology is of a scene where religious cosmogony is still, albeit temporarily, triumphant.42 By implication, all contemporary progressionist palaeonto- logists, all those who saw direction in the physical history of the earth, all those who thought forces might have acted with greater intensity in the past, are reduced to the caricature lowest common denominator of good- for-nothing Scriptural cosmogonists. Lyell certainly had no intention of playing a Raspe, a Generelli, a Playfair to any of his distinguished predecessors.43 In fact, and pace Rudwick, perhaps one of the functions of Lyell's history was actually to deny his parentage and to demonstrate that his approach was indeed an innovation: 'The charm of first discovery is our own.'44 The man who called his first book The principles of geology did not number diffidence among his vices.45 Let us turn from the mythic functions of Lyell's history to its intellec- tual presuppositions, the means which served those ends. What were Lyell's principles of history? Because of his didactic, polemical intentions, Lyell was to some extent writing anachronistic Whiggish heroes-and-villains history at its most opportunistic. Lyell is too preoccupied with praising (faintly) the good and satirizing the puerile to have any consistent concern with investigating why men thought in the way they did, or why some arrived at the right answers while others 'retarded the progress of truth'46-at least, such explanations as he offers are glib caricatures. There is no pre- tence to dispassionate scholarship-or at times to accurate scholarship: interpretative and even simple factual errors are legion, including the mis-citation of perhaps the most famous quotation in the whole of geology (Lyell quotes Hutton as writing 'no traces of a beginning').47 The immediate polemic aside, however, can one see Lyell as part of a coherent historiographical tradition? The answer is two-fold. His general commitment is to the brash, rationalist, philosophical conjectural history of the Enlightenment, with its pose of superior detachment, its psychological reductionism, its sardonic contempt for the Middle Ages and for Roman Catholicism.48 Lyell joins hands with the world of Hume and Gibbon, Adam Smith and Dugald Stewart, Condorcet and Turgot, Robertson and Scott, in writing a history which was itself readily assimi- lated by the rationalist historians of the Victorian age: Buckle, Draper, and Andrew White.49 His bland assumptions about the progress of ration- ality and refinement parallel the tone of Saint-Simon and Comte. None of this is surprising for a smart, ambitious,50 liberal advocate of the I820S who counted Sir Walter Scott and Henry Hallam amongst his acquain- tances and who had learned cocksure pen-militancy in the school of the Quarterly review. 5' But Lyell also makes, at the end of Chapter IV, a tantalizing ref- erence to Niebuhr's History of Rome.52 One would dearly love to know</page><page sequence="7">Charles Lyell and the Principles of the History of Geology 97 how Niebuhr, 'a great historian of our time', influenced Lyell. Did Niebuhr, programmatic revolutionary in the interpretation of historical evidence, suggest to Lyell the need, and the pattern, for a reappraisal of geological evidence? Niebuhr took the heroes and prodigies of the early history of Rome, exposed them as fabulous myths, and suggested that they stood as telescoped emblems for gradual developments over long periods of time.53 Not only is this precisely the reinterpretation which Lyell is offering for the reputedly catastrophic history of the early days of the earth. But he actually explains his revolution in geological thought through Niebuhrian historical parallels: 'Any period in past history may be eventful or flat, warlike or peaceful according as we extend the events over a wider or less wide space, so in older rocks if we shorten time, we render them marvellous'.54 Indeed, Lyell continually exploits the 'analogy of geology and history', a comparison that was on everybody's lips.55 But how deeply does the parallelism inform his historical and geological thought? Does the one actually influence the other? At one level, we should expect a disjunction, since for Lyell there was a deep ontological dualism between the history of the earth and the history of man, because the one is the natural and the other the moral and rational realm. The former is cyclical, timeless, steady-state; only the latter is progressive. At another level, there is a perhaps surprising disjunction. For while Lyell's history of the earth is uniformitarian, his history of geology is catastrophic: a succession of Gargantuan figures, great for their contribution or their baneful influence, paraded before the reader without law or cause. Lyell's history is prodigal of heroics and parsimonious of trends-the reverse of his geological prescription. Yet if we transcend the superficial differences, and examine the deeper structures of thought, we find unity in Lyell. As Duncan Forbes has penetratingly divined with reference to eighteenth-century philosophers, a uniformitarian perspective upon the natural world frequently accom- panied a rationalist vision, such as Lyell's, of the history of mankind. The cyclical uniformity of external nature was reflected in the constancy of human psychology, while the follies of mankind were set off unfavourably against the independent grandeur of Nature's operations. In this shared mentality, Lyell links up with Hume and Boulanger, Vico and Montes- quieu, Cicero and Seneca.56 I have argued so far that Lyell's genius forged a masterly propa- ganda history for establishing his own image of his role. Having exposed this myth, we must create the real history. We need then to turn lastly to the question: how useful is Lyell's history for constructing a dispassionate and objective understanding of his contribution to geology? How far must we free the history from Lyell? Through his practical geological experience and native intelligence,</page><page sequence="8">98 RoY PORTER Lyell certainly offers us many sharp and too-often neglected insights into the growth of the science. I might for instance mention his shrewd grasp of the importance of national traditions in science, or his at the time unfashionable but deeply rooted understanding that science was neces- sarily more than the accumulation of positive facts-that science was inseparable from systematic rational thought, and under the sway of the temper of the age.57 But-and disregarding blameless ignorance-Lyell's history, the work of a polemically entrenched scientific combatant, omits certain dimen- sions which the modern historian disregards at his peril. As an ambitious young geologist, consciously rebelling against his mentors, Lyell saw geology as 'a constant struggle'58 between the polar opposites of Hellenistic uniformitarianism, which was the only truly scientific method, and Hebraic catastrophism, which was unscientific, religiously biassed, geologically fruitless; and he projected this apocalyptic dichotomy onto his history of geology. But this Geology vs Genesis historical vision is false consciousness, as has been recognized by a growing band of current historians, including Professor Hooykaas, Leroy E. Page, Martin Rud- wick, and Walter Cannon.59 Their work has been showing not the anti- theses between scientific and religious commitments, but the complex overlapping of their domains (as is poignantly evident in Lyell's own Species notebooks). Their work also shows how Lyell's simplistic dichotomy vulgarizes the multiplicity of stances between pure uniformitarianism and pure catastrophism, having no place for the subtleties of Scrope's actualism or Sedgwick's directionalism, for example.6o And above all it fails to do justice to-perhaps, deliberately conceals-the tense and ambiguous intertwining of epistemology and ontology, of science, religion, and humanism in Lyell himself. To put this another way. Lyell's history of geology is catastrophist. Caricature heroes and villains loom out of the empty backdrop of his- tory.6' Lyell is not interested in the subtle discriminations of their thought or in the fine-textured relationship of men to their times. Geology is made and marred by Carlylean supermen not by the gradual accretions of schools and traditions, normal science and problem areas. And, of course, Lyell's teleology culminates with himself making a catastrophic revolution in geology. I will not prejudge the ontological question whether the science develops by revolution-as argued by Thomas Kuhn-or by evolution-Stephen Toulmin's position.62 But we must at least first apply the actualistic methodological device which Lyell urges on geologists at the end of his fifth chapter. We must Niebuhrize Lyell, and see if our catastrophes in the history of geology are not the product of ignorantly telescoping the developments of many men over many years into the genius of one giant. We must construct a history 'without violence, without fictions, without hypothesis, without miracles'.63 This conference</page><page sequence="9">Charles Lyell and the Principles of the History of Geology 99 could do a lot worse than pioneer an actualistic method in the history of geology. Secondly, the modern historian cannot afford to study the scientist and his science as if ostracized from his total social and intellectual matrix. Lyell is himself, of course, highly alert to the fraught relationships, both past and present, which entangled the science of geology with the values, institutions, and functions of society. But from his polemically embattled vantage-point, he saw these solely as 'impediments originating in extrinsic causes',64 which needed to be shaken off before geology could achieve its predestined splendid isolation in which alone it could thrive. Thus, he insists, science cannot flourish in a society until an independent class of natural philosophers arises, 'expressly set apart from the rest for study and contemplation'.65 But Lyell's single vision needs to be supplemented by another dimension. As Barry Barnes has recently argued, explanation in the history of science must be symmetrical.66 If, like Lyell, we accept that theological, philosophical, institutional and social causes may obstruct geology, we must logically also accept, and expect, that such causes can promote the growth of the science. Or, to drop this encumbring parlance of hindering and helping, we may simply say that the scientist and his ideas are part of an all-embracing totality of personal and intellectual relations within a society, at once shaped by, and shaping, them. Lyell's conviction that science only flourishes when independent of society is ideology- highly attractive and deeply pervasive, no doubt, but ideology none the less.67 For science never has been independent of society, nor is it indeed clear, pace Ly ell, that its strengths and successes vary in direct proportion to its distance from entangling social alliances. So we must study Lyell the man, his social connexions, his educational background, his legal training, the pattern of his career in geology, and his beliefs-about history, God, and the nature of man-in order to understand his geological science, of which all of these are constitutive. For though Lyell claimed that geology could now flourish precisely because it had now been divested, not least through his own crusade, of extraneous encumbrances, the more we discover about Lyell's own deepest personal commitments, the more they help us to explain once puzzling features of his science and to under- stand the strategy of his geology. Which brings me to my last point. Lyell's history set out to chronicle all the obstacles to the emergence of the true science of geology. Thought about the earth had been confused with other disciplines-cosmogony, human history, etc.-with which it properly had nothing in common. 'It was long ere the distinct nature and legitimate objects of geology were fully recognized, and it was at first confounded with many other branches of inquiry.'68 These impediments had now been surmounted, the true and timeless principles of geology revealed. Henceforth, the essence of</page><page sequence="10">100 RoY PORTER geology would not change. There would merely be progress within geology. Geology as such had no history; only a prehistory of mistaken approximations. But historians have recently been grasping not merely that develop- ments occur within sciences, but that the very sciences themselves, their 'epistemological space', the links and boundaries between them, are historically contingent, are highly time and space-dependent.69 That the very word 'geology' did not come into common usage till towards the end of the eighteenth century should alert us to this fact. Before then, men thought about the earth in various ways; from then, they increasingly conceptualized it 'geologically'. The science of geology, in other words, is no natural object. Neither did it enjoy a virgin birth. It was something made, forged, and confected, shaped both within the internal logic of problems in a long tradition of studies of the earth, and within the total configuration of intellectual structures at the time.70 Lyell blandly assumed that his thought within geology was indepen- dent of non-scientific constraints. I argued above that what was, in this case, for Lyell uproblematic and taken for granted must be rigorously questioned by us. Let us now take this one stage further. For Lyell the very category of 'geology' was itself self-evident. But we must treat it as problematic and investigate what it encompassed, and excluded, for Lyell and for others. We must assess Lyell's contribution not only within geology, but also to the making of the very artifact of 'geology' itself. This is a new venture for historians of geology. May Lyell's closing words encourage us :71 ... the charm of first discovery is our own, and as we explore this magnifi- cent field of inquiry, the sentiment of a great historian ... may continually be present to our minds, that 'he who calls what has vanished back again into being, enjoys a bliss like that of creating'.

Wilson (ed.), Sir Charles Lyell's scientific notebooks on the species question (New Haven, 1970). Charles Raven noted that Lyell's scathing treatment of the seventeenth-century physico- theologians revealed his own unconscious ambiguities on the subject; see his John Ray, naturalist (Cambridge, 1950), p. 441. 24 Lyell, Principles, i. 8, 76, and passim-for Lyell's conceptions are inseparable from his whole style of thought and vocabulary. Such notions are, of course, the bread-and-butter of Enlightenment speculative anthropology and Scottish conjectural history. 25 Lyell, Principles, i. io. 26 Lyell, Principles, i. 76. 27 As well as being the episteme of savagery, catastrophism is also symptomatic of moral decay and failure of nerve amongst the more civilized. Cf. Principles, i. I0. Lyell uses Prichard's work on Egyptian mythology to suggest that this kind of thinking, in whichever epoch, is no more advanced than the idea of a 'mundane egg'. I owe this point to Michael Neve. Compare the comments of E. H. Carr on the functions of cyclical catastrophist thinking in his What is history? (Harmondsworth, I967), pp. 43-6. 28 LLU, i. 27.</page><page sequence="12">I02 RoY PORTER 29Rudwick, op. cit. (ii), p. 9. 30 The manuscript materials quoted in the first volume of Leonard Wilson's biography do not illuminate these issues much further than the LLU. 3'I LL3, i. 271. 32 [W. H. Fitton], 'Review of Charles Lyell, Elements of geology', Edinburgh review, lxix (1 839), 406-66; cf. Bailey, op. cit. (2), p. 130. 33 LLU, i. 271. 34 Lyell, Principles, i. 54 f. Of de Saussure, Lyell wrote ungenerously: 'The few theoretical observations which escaped from him are, like those of Pallas, mere modifications of the old cosmological theories' (p. 54). 35 Lyell, Principles, i. 35. 36 He writes: Lazzoro Moro. This mistake is corrected in subsequent editions, unlike many of the errors of fact. 37 Lyell, Principles, i. 42 f. 38 Lyell, Principles, i. 4. 39 Lyell, Principles, i. 63 f. Lyell's unfavourable contrasting of Hutton to Generelli on this point is therefore misplaced. Lyell candidly admitted, 'I doubt whether I ever fairly read more than half his writings and skimmed the rest'; LL7, ii. 48. Cf. Bailey, op. cit. (2), p. 8i. 40 Lyell, Principles, i. 6i. 4I Though he does discuss recent advances in geology in Principles, i. 71 f., i.e. at the end of chapter IV. 42 As is evident from Principles, i. chapter V, the purpose of which is to show how false consciousness on the subject of time and man continue to retard geology. 43 Raspe revived and popularized Hooke (using Hooke as a mouthpiece for his own views). Generelli did the same for Moro and Playfair for Hutton. 44 Lyell, Principles, i. 74. 45 Lyell, of course (like Hutton), saw himself as applying the infinity and uniformity of Newtonian space to the dimension of time, and transforming geology into a science of causes. 46 Lyell, Principles, i. 39. 47 Lyell, Principles, i. 63 (my italics). He similarly miscited Hutton in LLj, i. 270. It is conceivable that Lyell took his error from W. D. Conybeare and W. Phillips, Outlines of the geology of En gland and Wales, Part I (London, I822), p. xlix., where 'traces' is used in a summary of Hutton's views. 48 For this historiography in England, cf. T. Peardon, The transition in English historical writing, I760-I830 (2 vols., New York, I933). Cf. Lyell, Principles, i. 23 f. 49 T. H.

Buckland, Reliquiae diluvianae', Quarterly review, xxix (1823), I29-65 (I39)- 56 Forbes, op. cit. (53), p. I98: 'There is, in fact, a distinct chain of ideas from Hume to Hutton, Lyell and Darwin'. Lyell's position is complex. His history of geology is catastrophic. But when he appeals to history as offering a model for geology, his picture of history is gradualist; see Principles, i. 3 f. 57 For example, his rejection of vulgar Baconianism and his championing of the necessary role of theory; Principles, i. 7I-2. Fitton's reviews in particular (op. cit [12]) had associated the progress of geology with Baconianism. Lyell's own reviews (see note 5I) seek to redress the balance. 58 Lyell, Principles, i. 30: 'A sketch of the progress of Geology is the history of a constant and violent struggle between new opinions and ancient doctrines, sanctioned by the implicit faith of many generations, and supposed to rest on scriptural authority'.</page><page sequence="13">Charles Lyell and the Principles of the History of Geologv 103 59 W.
