<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT BOOKS IN REVIEW NATURALISM AND SUPERNATURALISM The Lord of the River by Bernard Clavel, trans. Elizabeth Walter (Little, Brown, 1974. 255 pages. $6.95) A savage struggle between men and the alien elements which surround them gives rise, in this clamorous novel of incident, to a challenging meditation on the nature of man s responses to adversity. The lord of the river is barge captain Christian Merlin, a stout believer in the magical affinity linking men with the mercurial gods of the Rh?ne River? where horse-drawn barges con tend for commerce with new upstart steam-powered craft. The time is 1840, but an eerie agelessness imbues the forces that drive Merlin to "do battle with the river" and wage "war against iron." This novel's action, structure, imagery, and and characterization all draw together to form an enigmatic center of contending possible meanings. Its actions occur on a starkly naturalistic stage. Unnatural heat and dryness presage low water-levels; the barges cannot move. ( Nor can the hated steamers; Merlin delights at the spectacle of a grounded passenger ship, "immobile, wounded, snorting with helpless rage and spitting like a wildcat in a trap.") But high water is as much curse as blessing; when drought yields, "the water that would revivify the world" arrives in the guise of flood. Merlin vows to negotiate the sinuous contours of the un restrained Rh?ne (itself a "great animal")?and outdo the in capacitated steamers. The novel rushes to its apocalyptic conclusion. If action were indeed domi nant, one might read as explicit naturalism this feverish descrip tion of the river at flood: "It was one vast upheaval of Nature's forces. And amid this fury man also fought. Tiny yet towering, he battled for his modest possessions and his mighty pride." But Clavel continuously di lutes the narrative's flow. Prose poem vignettes celebrate natural power. Inset miniature essays describe the history of river trade. There are digressive paeans to the "supernatural force" that activates Merlin and his bargemen, to the "mighty secret voice" which encourages him to heroic resistance. These emphatic antinarrative devices help to conceal how meager is the novel's actual weight of plot. But they are openly thematic, too in sistent to be incidental. One senses a complexity larger than the canons of naturalism normally allow. There are ex istential truculence and stolidity, too?in that panoramic down X</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT BOOKS IN REVIEW sweep over "tiny yet towering" men. Merlin is a passionate, anger driven man. Is he admirably righteous or a slave to violence? He is finally gathered up in the crush of the flood for which he has waited and prayed. More than a great animal, Clavel's unsparing Rh?ne is a god. If his rugged bargeman participates in rituals that imply anthropomorphism or pantheism, he is a Christian "Merlin" as well. His rejection of encroach ing modernity is an angry jeremiad ("One day ... the wine of Condrieu will reek of coal, and the cheese will be uneatable because the goats have browsed on poisoned grass"). The motifs of flood, prophecy, and sacrifice widen this novel's range of suggestiveness. Clavel's careful interweaving of the naturalistic, the existential, and the theological makes his novel a richer, more generous work than its surface adventure narrative seems to promise. Yet questions of several kinds remain unanswered. May the translation give a misleading impression of Merlin s statements of strident partisanship? Are these perhaps more strictly limited to his consciousness and viewpoint than is clear?and does Clavel view his hero with appropriate distancing ob jectivity? Is Christian Merlin a vigorous Blakean rebel, meanly defeated and punished? Or a welcome demigod, designed for life-restoring sacrifice? These seem to me the questions that Lord of the River forces us to ask. ?Bruce Allen</page></plain_text>
