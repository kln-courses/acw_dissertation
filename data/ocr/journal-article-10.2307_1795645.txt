Marrickville, N.S.W.: Whitcombe and Tombs, for the Australian Geography Teachers* Association, 1968. 304 pages; maps, diagrams. $A5*5o Eight of the twenty-six chapters in this book are concerned with methodology and the rest with the practical problems of teaching geography in Australian schools. G. J. Butland shows that the large increase in the number of university geographers has made possible numerous research enquiries into historical, urban and applied geo? graphy, and also geomorphology and historical aspects. There has been a move away from regional geography to systematic studies that may, in time, provide material for a more adequate regional approach. D. S. Biddle discusses teaching in the secondary school and notes that the nature of the Australian environment has imposed economic limits on man's occupation of which every educated Australian should be aware. R. H. Greenwood gives a calm view of the possibilities of geographical teaching, and includes such topics as the definition and analysis of regional differences, the interaction of man- land (or man-resource) relationships, and the value of study on a world, continental or more local scale. Unfortunately he does not spare us from 'biography is about chaps, geography is about maps'. Two articles are contributed by G. H. Dury, who assembles a number of extracts from geographical writers which are emotional, fallacious, anthropomorphic, or even all three. He makes great fun of C. C. Carter's Landforms and Life with its manly public-school presentation of the W. M. Davis cycle of erosion. The other essay shows many of the pitfalls of teaching geomorphology in its present state of intellec- tual crisis, but the challenge must be faced and not the least interesting point is that schools can investigate streams, hill profiles and other features of the Australian environment, possibly with results of significance to the field researcher. The dynamic element is stressed both in this essay and in the treatment of regions by J. W. Fox, who criticizes the idea of Preston James that a region should be homogeneous ('variety may be the distinguishing feature') and shows that it may have a shifting population, may indeed be expanded by forward movement or diminished by backward movement of an agricultural frontier. P. H. Northcott and K. J. Collins contribute an entertain- ing essay on methodology and divide geographers into three parties, the right-wing environmental-deterministic (much decayed at present), the systematics-enthusiasts (vying with each other in the sophistication of quantification techniques) and the Centre-Unionists (alarmed at the prospects of disintegration). They want quantifica? tion to be a means and not an end, the sample study to be regarded as useful but still only a sample, and ask that if one studies the U.S.S.R. one should study the geographers also to understand this outlook and the development of their country. Teachers, having read all these essays, then go forward to the work of educating the youth of Australia better informed, one hopes, than the lady who told the present writer, 'I had no idea that there was any disagreement among university geographers.' She had a lot to learn. T. W. Freeman</page></plain_text>
