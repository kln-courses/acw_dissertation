<plain_text><page sequence="1">Positivism redivivus? A critique of recent uncritical proposals for reforming sociological theory (and related foibles)* Joseph M. Bryant Abstract. Notwithstanding that positivism has been moribund in contemporary philosophy of science for nearly a quarter century, it continues to animate and misinform methodological reflection in mainstream sociology. In the latest in a long line of exhortations to greater positivistic rigor, Gerhard Lenski claims that "complacency" in theory construction is the chief obstacle to knowledge cumulation and the development of general theory. As the requisite corrective, he seeks to rehabilitate the shopworn ritual of covering laws, operationalization, and the mathematical specifi- cation of variables. The critique herein presented reverses the charge of complacency, and documents a series of intrinsic logical and substantive flaws in the positivistic program, with illustrations drawn primarily from the works of Jonathan Turner, Guy Swanson, and Lenski himself. Resume. Bien que le positivisme dans la philosophie des sciences contemporaine soit moribond depuis pres d'un quart de siecle, il continue d'animer et de mal informer la reflexion qui s'effectue dans le courant dominant de la sociologie. Cautionnant une longue lign6e d'incitations a plus de rigueur methodologique, Gerhard Lenski a fait valoir qu'une certaine "negligence" dans la construc- tion de theories constitue l'obstacle majeur l' accumulation des connaissances et au developpement d'une theorie generale. Comme facteur de correction, il propose de reinstaurer le rituel habituel des lois generales, de l'exigence d'operationnalite, et de la definition mathematique des variables. La critique presentee ici denonce l'accusation de negligence, et, elle documente une serie de faiblesses intrinseques dans le raisonnement et le contenu du programme positiviste, a l'aide, essentiellement, d'illustrations tir6es des travaux de Jonathan Turner, Guy Swanson et de Lenski lui-meme. * I would like to thank Irving Zeitlin, Randall Collins, Jeffrey Alexander, Rod Nelson, Bernd Baldus, John Rist, Alan Sica, Jack Veugelers, Chris Kevill, Andrew Kim, Maurice Zeitlin, and the Journal's editor and anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and criticisms of earlier drafts of this paper.

Indeed, widespread disagreement still persists over even the most basic of epistemological and ontological questions. There has, however, been a marked resurgence of an avowedly positivistic disposition in recent theoretical discourse, assertively advancing the claim that such a renewal will raise sociology to a more respectable scientific status. 2 This essay proposes to examine the warrant for this trend, primarily through a detailed exposition of various exemplars of positivistic practice. For purposes of expo- sition, our inquiry will be organized thematically around a recent lead article in the American Sociological Review by Gerhard Lenski, entitled "Rethinking Macrosociological Theory" (1988), which offers a convenient summary of the core principles of this positivist revival. By critically engaging this literature I hope to not only test the scientific merit of the various reforms proposed, but also bring into focus the unsatisfactory way in which theoretical discourse is presently conducted within the discipline -i.e., via misrepresentation, evasion, and sectarian modes of self-legitimation. Lenski's defense of positivism begins with the claim that the central problem confronting social science today is intellectual "complacency," as revealed above all in the loose and impressionistic quality of most sociological concepts and theories, "flaws that we have negligently allowed to survive and flourish at great cost to the development and intellectual health of our disciplines" (1988: 164). The ills as diagnosed readily prescribe their own therapeutic: "theory construction," Lenski contends, should henceforth be carried out with far "greater rigor and discipline than is currently the norm." In practice that will entail immediate adoption of the following "minimal standards" of any true science: (a) concepts must be defined in operationally unambiguous terms, (b) relationships between variables must be clearly specified, preferably in mathematical form, (c) theories must become subject to empirical testing and possible falsification, and (d) covering laws should be established which allow for the derivation of more specialized explanations and theories. These recommendations will receive closer examination below, but at the outset a few observations must be made with regard to the way in which Lenski 1. And that is if we begin no earlier than with Vico's rejoinder to Descartes' imperious mathematical rationalism. 2. Although there are several varieties, I will use the term "positivism" to refer to that orientation which advocates the extension of natural science models to the social sciences, i.e., methodologi- cal monism, the basic assumption being that what distinguishes the two fields is not so much the respective objects of study but sundry practical or technical difficulties. Thoughtful reviews on the place of positivism in modern sociology can be found in Bernstein (1976), Alexander (1982), and Halfpenny (1982). 30</page><page sequence="3">frames the basic problematic, as well as his manner of addressing well-known objections to the positivistic program. For as anyone familiar with the history of methodological disputes in the social sciences will realize, Lenski's proposed therapeutic is at bottom a rather old-fashioned remedy, one that has been repeatedly prescribed ever since the first crude but heady elixirs were concocted by the mechanical materialists of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. Those learned gentlemen, let us recall, looked forward with great anticipation and confidence to a time when the application of the methods of mathematics and the physical sciences to human affairs would yield a sociology as scientific as - in Condorcet's celebrated comparison - the sciences that study "the society of beavers or of bees." From that period of understandably exuberant but naive rationalism to the present, there has been no shortage of calls that the social sciences model their analytical techniques after the proven methods of the natural sciences; and indeed, mainstream academic sociology has long been preoccupied with precisely that task on the practical levels of both research design and theory construction. Of the disappointing results so far achieved, one might be tempted to comment in the spirit of Galileo, "and yet it moves not." But apparently the time for such objective "heresy" is not upon us, for here at the near-close of the twentieth century it is still the clamour for "greater rigor and discipline" which passes for serious "rethinking" in our leading scholarly publications. Perhaps the charge of complacency is not so much erroneous as misdirected, for what else is one to say of doctors who continue to prescribe the same palliatives decade after decade with no signs of improving vitality for their long languorous patient? On the nature of science Lenski opens his call for a positivistic renewal by noting that the scientific status of sociology remains very much in doubt. He grants some merit to the conven- tional defense which legitimizes social inquiry on the grounds that it follows "the scientific method," but to his mind one critical shortcoming remains: Science is more than method: its ultimate aim is the development of a body of "verified" general theory. Thus, for many who are trained in the natural sciences, the acid test of the scientific status of a discipline is the quality of its theory, and, regrettably, most social science theories in general, and macrosociological theories in particular, do not fare well by this standard. (1988: 163) We are thus categorically informed at the outset that any discipline which claims to be a science - irrespective of its subject-matter, be it human beings or subatomic particles - must be concerned with the development of "general theory," an aim that "goes beyond the formulation of scattered and disparate partial or limited theories." For sociology this achievement will, purportedly, take the form of "a theory capable of explaining all of the more important uniformities and variations in all known human societies" (1988: 169). The rhetoric is certainly grand, to some perhaps even visionary, but the salient 31</page><page sequence="4">question is of course whether it is also scientifically sound? Although undoubtedly aware that both the very possibility and the value of such an all-encompassing analytical framework have been called into question by many distinguished scholars, Lenski apparently sees no need to justify his position, other than to simply observe that the present quality of our theories would not greatly impress "those trained in the natural sciences." Since physi- cists and molecular biologists have their own immense problems to work out, and enjoy no obvious qualifications which should allow them to legislate for any sciences other than their own, this can hardly pass as a compelling consideration. Such a cavalier manner is all the more unacceptable when one considers that Max Weber - surely one of the least "negligent" and "complacent" of scholars - presented a host of reasoned epistemological and ontological arguments against "this will-to-believe of naturalistic monism" nearly a century ago, all in an effort to underscore the following basic point: Laws are important and valuable in the Naturwissenschaften, in the measure that those sciences are universally valid. For the knowledge of historical phenomena in their concreteness, the most general laws, because they are the most devoid of content, are also the least valuable. The more comprehen- sive the validity, or scope, of a term, the more it leads us away from the richness of reality since in order to include the common elements of the largest possible number of phenomena, it must necessarily be as abstract as possible and hence devoid of content. In the Kulturwissenschaften, the knowledge of the universal or general is never valuable in itself. ([1904] 1949: 80) Weber goes on to show that precisely because the "facts" or "laws" of human behaviour are culturally and historically contingent rather than universally valid, the nature and role of theorizing in the social sciences will necessarily differ from analogous procedures in the natural sciences: In the cultural sciences concept-construction depends on the setting of the problem, and the latter varies with the content of culture itself. The relationship between concept and reality in the cultural sciences involves the transitoriness of all such syntheses. The great attempts at theory construction in our science were always useful for revealing the limits of the significance of those points of view which provided their foundations. The greatest advances in the sphere of the social sciences are substantively tied up with the shift in practical cultural problems and take the guise of a critique of concept-construction. ([1904] 1949: 105-6) Irrespective of what one thinks of this particular judgment, even the most hardened critic must concede that Weber's methodological writings are replete with reasoned arguments, defending his own conception of social science while simultaneously advancing detailed criticisms of opposing points of view. Lenski's manner of procedure is altogether different, for instead of demonstrating the cogency of the unified science ideal and its specific applicability to sociology, he simply assumes its binding and incontrovertible correctness. In a priori fashion, the elusive grail of positivism is declared the ultimate standard of true science, while all those who refuse to rally to this banner are banished from the kingdom: 32</page><page sequence="5">I realize, of course, that not all sociologists accept the idea that sociology is (or should be or can become) a science or that it should be guided by the standards of science. Those who reject this view of the discipline will find little of interest in this paper. (Lenski, 1988: 164) So stated, the issue is conveniently - and misleadingly - turned into a disagreement between presumably progressive scientists on the one hand and antediluvian artists-cum-philosophers on the other. This disastrous misconcep- tion, which precludes any fair assessment of the challenges posed by the opposition, seems to be virtually an article of faith amongst those who adhere to the natural science ideal. Thus Hubert Blalock, for example, in his Basic Dilemmas in the Social Sciences (1984), prejudicially subsumes all objections to positivism under a section alarmingly entitled "The Anti-Science Attack." Not only does he thereby rule out any possibility for a scientific alternative to the monistic program, he debases the significance of the challenge itself by suggest- ing that its "appeal" is especially suited "to the poets and artists among us" (1984: 25).3 From the perspective of those already "committed" to the natural science ideal, it is of course understandable that dissenters will be viewed in such a transfiguring, unflattering light. But no amount of misrepresentation can alter the fact that the real debate touches other matters, of which differing conceptions of science and the variable nature and role of theory within scientific inquiry are the most essential. That "the standards of science" are uniform and general rather than plural and specific to the nature of the objects of study is a point that has to be demonstrated rather than declared - particularly in light of the comprehen- sive repudiation of the logical positivist paradigm that has taken place in the philosophy of science over the past several decades.4 By proceeding from the premises and convictions identified, Lenski denies to himself and his audience that open, self-critical style of cross-examination which alone can elevate polemic and blind advocacy to the level of mutually enriching dialectic. Offered 3. I should add that Blalock's book provides a most formidable array of objections to current methodological practices in what he invidiously calls the "science-oriented" (i.e., quantitative) wing of the discipline. Notwithstanding that his critique and recommendations remain limited by a steadfast adherence to the positivistic framework, I can only urge the widest possible readership for this thoughtful - and to my mind damning - "internal" appraisal by one of our discipline's most celebrated methodologists. Also meriting serious attention are the compelling strictures offered by Otis Dudley Duncan (1984) against "statisticism" and composite indexes, and his discerning recognition that many standard quantitative procedures are rendered nugatory by a host of refractory measurement problems. These "measurement problems," it should be noted, usually turn out to involve the two factors or dimensions that positivists obstinately seek to banish from social science: history and culture. 4. Indeed, even the rubrics "natural" and "social science" are inadequate to convey the wide divergences in theoretical reflection and research practice that obtain in the disciplines subsumed under those labels. Not only do the advocates of methodological monism err in seeking to assimilate "social" to "natural" science, they typically "flatten out" the reality of diversity within the natural sciences themselves in favour of a simplified classical mechanics. See Suppe (1977) for an extended discussion on the varieties of scientific theory. 33</page><page sequence="6">in its stead is a call to debate which both miscasts the opposition and peremptorily limits the scope of the discussion to conform with its own preconceptions - a manner of discourse singularly ill-suited to dispel the clouds of bias, ignorance, and error which bedarken clear thinking. Have we, perhaps, just identified one of the reasons why so little progress has been made in establishing a consensus on the scientific foundations of sociology? On criticisms raised ... and ignored Lenski's partisan stance becomes even more debilitating in a section entitled "Some Objections Considered," where he turns to evaluate several standard criticisms of the positivistic program. Among the "seemingly cogent objections raised to proposals for employing the natural sciences as models for the social sciences," Lenski mentions the following three: the fact that "people are different" from the objects of study in the natural sciences owing to their possession of "consciousness and wills"; that human behaviour is "profoundly influenced by extraordinarily complex cultural traditions," thereby rendering specification of the determinants of action extremely difficult; and thirdly, that many of the most important aspects of social life are "not amenable to controlled experimentation under laboratory conditions" (1988: 164). Though by no means an exhaustive inventory of the arguments against methodological monism, Lenski nonetheless allows "much truth" to the asser- tion that, in light of these factors, "the social sciences cannot operate in the same way, or be governed by the same rules, as the natural sciences." However, rather than draw out the logical implications of this fundamental concession, Lenski proceeds to reclaim what he has just yielded: "The social sciences must, of necessity, adapt-their mode of inquiry to these realities. But this does not justify the abandonment or neglect of all the standards of moder science" (1988:164). With that non sequitur and illicit identification of positivism with science, Lenski abandons all consideration of the implications of the anti-positivist critique, and promptly renews his call for that elusive "general theory" which will explain "all the more important uniformities and variations in all known human societies." Although ostensibly an exercise in "rethinking," not a single line is devoted to reflection on the possibility that since our discipline must "adapt" to the aforementioned "realities," then perhaps our theories will differ in logical structure and scope from those which deal with subatomic particles, unicellular organisms, and other such phenomena lacking "consciousness and wills" and "extraordinarily complex cultural traditions." Nor is any thought given to the possibility that since meaningful human action is for the most part historically and culturally contingent, then perhaps the "general theory" of which positivists are so enamoured is a chimera, a false ideal illogically transplanted from one scientific domain to another which just happens to investigate phenomena of a radically differing ontological order. These lacunae 34</page><page sequence="7">are all the more surprising seeing that after several hundred years of sustained inquiry, no general "laws" or theories in the social sciences have yet been formulated that even remotely attain the combined precision, scope, and intel- lectual significance of those in the natural sciences. As to a likely reason why there is no manifest uneasiness about this revealing gap between the promise and the performance of positivism, might we not surmise that here too "compla- cency" reigns supreme?5 Undaunted by the record of past shortcomings,6 Lenski fails to give any consideration whatsoever to the question of whether the distinctive ontology of social phenomena might delimit the nature and role of sociological theorizing. He offers, instead, a passing sideswipe at a scholar noted for his appreciation of that very issue, Anthony Giddens, who is not only misrepresented as having "no desire to conform to scientific [read: positivistic] standards of theory construc- tion," but whose reflections on the recursive interplay of social structure and human agency within the contextualities of time and place are simply ignored rather than refuted (1988: 168). So undiminished is Lenski's enthusiasm that he is even emboldened to prophesy, divining that "if theory construction can be improved sufficiently in the years ahead, we will arrive at the point where algebraic formulations of most theories become routine" (1988: 167). Just how we are to arrive at that point, i.e., how the qualitative richness of social life and its continual ebb and flow of tangled contingencies are to be reduced to the quantitative axioms of mathematical logic - a formal discipline, incidentally, that abstracts from the peculiarities of specific spatio-temporal domains - is not 5. Cracks and fissures in the foundations are perceptibly widening, however. In addition to the imposing registry of persistent defects in quantitative sociology identified by Blalock and Duncan, Stanley Lieberson's Making It Count (1985) offers an equally detailed insider's indictment. Though still committed to the ideals of quantitative methods, Lieberson candidly confesses that he has "reluctantly reached the conclusion that many of the procedures and assumptions in this enterprise are of no more merit than a quest for a perpetual-motion machine" (1985: ix). When a scholar of such experience determines that "a radical reformation is desperately needed," is it too much to hope that more serious attention will henceforth be given to the fundamental criticisms of positivism that have been made by the likes of Weber, Znaniecki, MacIver, Blumer, Adomo, Habermas, and many others? Incidentally, as I read Lieberson's proposed solutions, their logical extension would fully entail historical-comparative sociology, inasmuch as a greater sensitivity to time and cultural contexts figures prominently in his evaluation. 6. Inhis recentexchange withBaldus (1990; 1991) inthisjournal, Lenski(1991: 192) concedes that some neopositivist sociology has "led to incorrect views of the social world." He insists, however, that this "does not mean that the principles themselves are flawed," only that they have been misapplied by "fallible human beings." He also continues to equate true science with positivism, and positivism with empiricism, and on that basis again charges that all non- positivistic sociologies have confused "the goals and methods" of social science with those of the humanities (1991: 188). 35</page><page sequence="8">included in the prognosis.7 A glance at one of our kindred disciplines proves instructive in this regard, for serious scientific objections are being raised with increasing frequency against extensive mathematization even in economics, the social science obviously best-suited to sustaining such analyses.8 And if that circumstance is not sufficiently cautionary, let it be noted that objections have been raised in other interested quarters as well, for in the judgment of many professional mathematicians, "mathematical sociology" is a pretentious but comical contradiction in terms (see, for example, Koblitz, 1981; Davis and Hersh, 1986).9 Ancients and moderns revisited As with others advocating a positivist revival, Lenski's bete noire is the "muddled state" of sociological theory. In contrast to the natural sciences, where theories are continuously "refined and improved" through research, Lenski maintains that theories in the social sciences do not so much progress as proliferate, undisciplined by the requirements of empirical testing. Although the "lack of rigor" in theory construction is the ultimate source of these embarrass- ments, a contributory vice of some weight is said to be the manner in which theoretical work is imparted to apprentices in training. For rather than demon- strate "the relevance of theory for research," graduate theory courses typically concentrate on the exegesis of classical texts, especially those authored by "the Holy Trinity - Marx, Weber, and Durkheim." The teaching of social theory is thus alleged to have more in common with "seminary instruction in theology and biblical studies than with graduate instruction in the natural sciences," with the 7. Flat declarations of faith in the mathematical redemption of sociology are hardly compelling when set against the learned judgment of someone like Anatol Rapoport: "no convincing case can be made on the basis of contemporary contributions of mathematical approaches to the social sciences that anything resembling the magnificent edifice of the physical sciences is being constructed" (1983: vi). Rapoport concludes his "state-of-the-art" report by enjoining that "confidence in the deductive powers of mathematical models" be candidly "coupled with scepticism concerning the range of applicability" (1983: 482). 8. Leontief provides a succinct summary of the situation: "Uncritical enthusiasm for mathematical formulation tends often to conceal the ephemeral substantive content of the argument behind the formidable front of algebraic signs" (1971: 1-2). For further objections, including the manifest unreality of many mathematical assumptions and procedures when applied to economic phenomena, see Hendry, "Econometrics: Alchemy or science?" (1980), and Leamer, "Let's take the con out of econometrics" (1983). Keynes's (1939) dissenting review of multiple correlation analysis in economics still retains its force after half a century, for the logical arguments he raised address foundational matters that override questions of mere technique. The recent surge in interest in non-linear dynamics and system turbulence, from physics to economics, and subsumed under the general heading of"chaos theory," is also germane. For an introduction, see Brock, "Chaos and complexity in economic and financial science" (1990). 9. Koblitz is one mathematician, however, who is not laughing about the rampant "mathematization of social phenomena": he bitterly denounces "this perversion of our discipline" and strongly urges the members of his profession to"take a stand againstmathematical quackery" (1981:120). 36</page><page sequence="9">result that "we tend to raise up new generations of theorists who too often emulate the old masters in ways that hinder, rather than advance, the cause of macrosociology" (1988: 165). That the continued prominence of classical ideas and insights in our core texts might suggest their scientific superiority over more modem positivistic contri- butions is, of course, another possible reading of the situation (cf. Alexander, 1987), but Lenski's predilections once again rule out the plausible on assertoric grounds: I am not suggesting that sociology abandon the study of prototheorists whose works fall short of the standards of modem scientific theory. Their works often contain invaluable insights that must not be lost. In directing graduate students to read such works we should encourage them to search out these insights and think about how they can be incorporated into more rigorous theoretical formulations. We should not, however, leave the impression that these older works conform to the standards of good scientific theory. (1988: 165) Iconoclasm, admittedly, is not without its honoured place in scientific discourse, but before applauding the courage, one must perforce appraise the cogency of the indictment. The proponents of positivism have hitherto enjoyed a distinct eristical advantage in debates of this sort, however, as they have managed to insulate their program from full criticism by judiciously casting it in the future tense. Lenski's declaration that the algebraic formulation of most sociological theories will someday "become routine" has its ancestry in a long line of similar mantic pronouncements by earlier positivists, such as the following exhortation by Henry Thomas Buckle (1871), who in his own day was no less certain that "complacency" and "negligence" were the chief obstacles to scientific progress: I hope to accomplish for the history of man something equivalent, or at all events analogous, to what has been effected by other inquirers for the different branches of natural science. In regard to nature, events apparently the most irregular and capricious have been explained, and have been shown to be in accordance with certain fixed and universal laws. This has been done because men of ability, and, above all, men of patient, untiring thought, have studied natural events with the view of discovering their regularity: and if human events were subjected to similar treatment, we have every right to expect similar results.... Indeed, the progress of inquiry is becoming so rapid and so earnest, that I entertain little doubt that before another century has elapsed, the chain of evidence will be complete, and it will be as rare to find an historian who denies the undeviating regularity of the moral world, as it now is to find a philosopher who denies the regularity of the material world. (1871: 6, 33) The declamation delivered, there usually follows a programmatic registry of recommendations on how these wondrous results will one day be achieved, followed in turn by an admittedly incomplete attempt to illustrate the practical utility of these principles in some limited arena. Since it is manifest that no critic can deliver a mortal blow against either a lively imagination or a provisional system said to be pregnant with future advances, we have yet another reason why the history of methodological controversies in the social sciences is so monoto- nous: to the critic's repeated injunction "deliver," the advocate persistently 37</page><page sequence="10">replies "in due course," and nonchalantly erases time past by resetting the chronometer.'0 Before assessing Lenski's own programmatic proposals, I will attempt to gauge the alleged scientific inadequacies of the "prototheorists" by briefly examining the purported advances made by two noted contemporary sociolo- gists, Jonathan Turner and Guy Swanson, whose respective works exemplify several defining features of the modern positivistic program. Turner's Societal Stratification: A Theoretical Analysis (1984), is cited by Lenski as a work of great scientific merit, distinctly laudable for "the special effort made to specify the form of relationships among variables" (1988: 167). In part that special effort features an attempt by Turner to reformulate aspects of Lenski's own earlier work, Power and Privilege, into the "more rigorous" language of algebraic equations - thereby illustrating the "cumulative progress" that positivism promises. A common disregard for the "prototheorists" likewise binds the two scholars, seeing that it is Turner's stated opinion that "at best, Marx, Weber, and others of the last century should now be footnotes" (1984: 38). And like Blalock, Lenski, and other advocates of the natural science ideal, Turner also illegitimately assumes that the critics of positivism are ipsofacto opposed to any kind of science of the social: To argue that the laws of human organization can be discovered and articulated invites criticism and stirs controversy. Indeed, many in the social sciences denounce the search for such laws as foolhardy and a waste of time. For those in this camp, there is "something different" about humans which makes a science of social relations not just a waste of time but also a contradiction in terms. (1984: 1) The expediency of such rhetoric is of course readily transparent, for by consign- ing all opposition to an "anti-science" fringe, the proponentevades confrontation with those serious intellectual arguments which might expose his own untenable extremism. Theory construction for Turner entails a three-pronged effort to formulate concepts about "the most generic dimensions of the social universe," to state with precision the relations among those concepts, and ultimately, to extract "the immanent laws of our natural system" (1984:14). Firmly convinced that human social organization reveals "invariant properties," Turner seeks to recapture the "lost vision" of Auguste Comte by developing a kind of social physics or mechanics, specifically enjoining that the laws we discover "should be timeless and should be useful no matter what the context" (1984: 31). With regard to social inequality, Turner's aim is to formulate a series of interrelated abstract 10. "The present tendency is to loaf and generalize ... We need men not afraid to work, who will get busy with the adding machine and the algorithms, and give us exact studies, such as we get in the psychological laboratories, not to speak of the biological and physical laboratories. Sociology can be an exact, quantitative science, if we get industrious men interested in it." Thus Franklin Giddings in a 1909 issue of the American Journal of Sociology. Stylistic differences apart, the positions of the modem positivist and Giddings are substantively similar. 38</page><page sequence="11">laws regarding the generic properties of stratification, which are said to revolve around three constituent processes: the unequal distribution of valued resources, and the formation and ranking of homogeneous subpopulations. The remainder of the book is given over to the formulation of various algebraic equations which deal with these purported generic processes, from which I will present a representative sample. Turner's first equation concerns distributional inequality: I = Wl (Cmw) + W2 (Cpo) + W3 (Cpr), where WI &gt; W2 &gt; W3 That is, the degree of inequality (I) in the distribution of resources is an additive and weighted function (W) of the degree of concentration (C) in material wealth (mw), power (po), and prestige (pr), in that rank order of importance. The utility of encasing an elementary nominal definition in algebraic form is rather difficult to gauge here, given both the failure to specify the "units" that are allegedly "additive" and the conspicuous absence of actual weights for the "weightings." More revealing perhaps is the fact that Turner himself finds the theorem too restrictive. He concedes that the assigned order of relative importance might not hold in all societies, suspecting that prestige, for example, is typically more relevant than wealth or power in "relatively undifferentiated systems," such as hunting and gathering societies. Exceptions could in fact be endlessly multiplied, even for highly complex societies, Turner's suggestion to the contrary notwith- standing.1l So much, then, for the Comtean requirement that our theorems regarding the "generic processes of the social universe" be timeless and useful "no matter what the context" - an injunction so unrealistic, i.e., unscientific, that even its leading advocate is forced into evasions. Explanatory equations specifying the factors which condition the concentra- tion of wealth, power, and prestige occupy the middle chapters of Turner's treatise. For example: Cmw = Wl (P exp) + [ W2 (NH CXP) x W3 (NO -XP) I, where Wl &gt; W2 &gt; W3 Translation: material wealth is concentrated as a positive exponential function of productivity (P), additively related to the negative exponential function of the number of social hierarchies (NH), which is multiplicatively related to the negative exponential function of the number of organizational subunits (NO), in that order of salience. Even apart from the flummery about additive and 11. By way of example, Imperial Rome must surely rate as a highly complex, "differentiated" society, and yet clearly the concentration of material wealth did not uniformly outweigh either power or prestige, as many a fabulously wealthy freedman ruefully appreciated as he groaned under the exactions of his less pecunious patron. One need only reflect on the profound differences in the patterns of inequality that characterize modem societies like Britain, the US, Japan, China, the USSR, and South Africa, to realize that neither in an explanatory nor in a descriptive sense does Turner's equation capture anything "invariant" or "universal." 39</page><page sequence="12">multiplicative relations,'2 is it not manifest that no "invariant" exponential relation holds between productivity, specified as the most important factor, and the concentration of material wealth? History furnishes numerous examples where with stagnant or even declining productivity, the powerful readily intensified their exactions against the lower orders according to whim and circumstance, the varying degrees of exploitation unattended by any significant changes in NH or NO (cf., for example, Andreski's work on "parasitism," 1966). Equally inconsistent with Turner's algebraic law is the evidence pertaining to contemporary patterns of inequality, where virtually every study reveals that the concentration of wealth is consistently greater in those countries with unproduc- tive and underdeveloped economies. And should Turner suggest that this counterfactual is a function of the additive and multiplicative relations between the sheer number of hierarchies and organizational subunits (this will distinguish Brazil from France, Mexico from Italy, Indonesia from Canada?), what then happens to P &gt; NH &gt; NO? If one intends to add contextual qualifications to every equation whenever it engages concrete reality, why maintain the lofty pretense that one is uncovering "invariant laws" rather than relations that are historically and culturally contingent? As another illustration of this kind of transhistorical "aerial theorizing," consider Turner's view of power: Cpo = WI [og (ET) ] + [ W2 (P ex) x W3 (IC exp) X W4 (IT eP) ], where WI &gt; W2 &gt; W3 &gt; W4 Or: the concentration of power is a logarithmic function of the level of perceived external threat (ET), i.e., initial increases in perceived threat foster more Cpo than subsequent ones, additively related to the multiplicatively related exponential functions of productivity (P), level of internal conflict (IC), and internal transactions (IT), in that order of value. Just why external threat is singled out as the prime factor seems to be based more on the author's predilection for Herbert Spencer than on any detailed acquaintance with the sociology of actual power relations, seeing how history furnishes innumerable examples where tyrants and narrow oligarchies held despotic sway without the benefit of pointing to potentially more onerous taskmasters across their borders (try plugging the equation into Ceausescu's Romania, just before and right after his fall!). A random perusal of any standard comparative history textbook - better, Michael Mann's historically grounded sociology of power (1986) - should suffice to demonstrate that the other specifications will prove equally brittle upon contact with empirical reality. 12. Surely it is not the mere number of such hierarchies and organizations which matters in the dispersal or concentration of wealth and power, but their nature, their resources, their logistical capacities (i.e., sociology, not arithmetic!). To judge from his algebraic theories, one might conclude that for Turner raw counting is the hallmark of scientific explanation. 40</page><page sequence="13">Turner claims that his strategy of identifying generic properties and processes will yield "a repository" of elementary principles and laws from which sociolo- gists will be able to draw for various explanatory purposes. But since his etherialized equations are empirically dubious without a host of contextual qualifications, what we actually have is an elementary checklist of factors or "variables" of possible relevance, but so limited and elementary that any sociologist should feel embarrassed were it not part of his or her intellectual arsenal already.13 If this judgment sounds extreme, reflect upon the assessment made by a sympathetic observer, Randall Collins, who while praising the boldness of the enterprise, nonetheless expresses serious doubts that Turner's theory "specifies all the most important factors, or gets the relationships among them correct," and notes that many of the mathematical specifications are also highly debatable (1988: 153-63). Given Turner's stated aim of identifying "the invariant immanent laws of the social universe," I can scarcely conceive of a more damaging commentary. In short, by concentrating more on the form he believes theories should take rather than on the content that needs explaining, Turner fails in that most basic of scientific requirements: the imperative of adapting one's theories to the essential contours of reality, a reality which for the social sciences is irreducibly embedded in those shifting contexts of historical time and cultural milieu that provide the frames of meaningfor human agency. A theory that ultimately fails to touch ground with its ontological base must, in truth, be judged a metaphysical regression - if we are to decide such matters in conformity with "the standards of modern science." In contrast to Turner's decidedly abstract theorizing ("back to your arm- chairs" is his rallying cry), Guy Swanson has attempted to bring the insights of theory to bear on empirical problems, in part by operationalizing the qualitative formulations offered by the likes of Durkheim and Weber. Since criticism will prevail here, let me state initially that there is much to be admired in Swanson's scholarship, not least his attention to important problems and his obvious erudition. Unfortunately, those strengths are typically vitiated by a methodology that routinely strips the facts from their determinant contexts and uniformly grinds them through the proverbial statistical mill. Swanson is in fact an accomplished pioneer in what might best be understood as a kind of positivistic historical-comparative sociology - presently much in vogue - whereby the annals of history and the ethnographic record are alike treated as immense data- banks, the disparate facts to be rifled from hither and yon and then artificially 13. Apart from failing to conform to the diversity of the basic facts about inequality, Turner's procrustean equations provide no enlightenment as to how structures of domination and exploitation are erected and sustained - Weberian and Marxian concepts, I should add, that are not to be found in Turner's theoretical lexicon, notwithstanding that they would appear to be both more germane and "generic" to the subject matter than ET, IT, or NO. 41</page><page sequence="14">aggregated and standardized forpurposes of mathematical analysis. To illustrate the defects inherent in such a method, let us first examine Swanson's celebrated study, The Birth of the Gods (1960). Building upon Durkheim's thesis that the sacred constitutes a symbolic representation of society, Swanson proposes a more rigorous empirical investi- gation into the social origins of several important aspects of religious life, including monotheism, ancestor worship, and reincarnation. A sample of fifty "primitive and ancient" societies drawn from Murdock's ethnographic atlas furnishes the data. Swanson's organizing theoretical premise is that beliefs in the supernatural are representations of the "constitutional structures of sovereign groups," by which he means the specific areas of competence and activity of organizations that exercise "independent jurisdiction over some sphere of life" (1960: 20). Political experiences, in other words, serve as primary models for conceptions of the divine. Swanson opens his account of monotheism by postulating that "high gods," i.e., deities that either created and/or presently govern the universe, are likely to appear whenever a society features at least three hierarchically arranged sover- eign groups (e.g., family, clan, village, kingdom, etc). This thesis proceeds from the presumed isomorphism between the political and the spiritual, in that the superordinate organization - which will order and control the subordinates - should give rise to belief in a deity analogously responsible for maintaining cosmic order and unity. Even apart from the problems of reductionism here, it is not easy to see how this mode of analysis can shed any light on "monotheism," for not only will there be precious few societies that lack the three sovereign groups, but also because every "high god" in the sample but one is drawn from a polytheistic religion. Closer examination of the alleged monotheistic cases only serves to expose the utter unsuitability of this kind of mass-processing of context-dependent data, for registered among the nineteen societies featuring "high gods" are the following consecutive entries: 11. Israelites - Yahweh created all reality which he now governs actively. He supports human moral codes. 12. Lengua - A beetle created all things. He takes no interest in his creation. (1960: 67) That the beetle god has about as much in common with Yahweh as chalk has with cheese would seem to be an obvious deduction, and yet for purposes of statistical analysis the two cases are treated as mathematical equivalents, of identical value in the "scientific" search for the social origins of monotheism! And lest I be accused of ethnocentrism in highlighting such an invidious but comical "homo- geneity assumption," let me add that similar theological and ritual disparities abound among the othercases as well (cf. the Nuer and the Zulu "monotheisms"). The distortions that attend this mechanical aggregation of culturally diverse forms are unfortunately only compounded by the other peculiarity of this 42</page><page sequence="15">methodology: its inattention to the diachronic dimensions of social life. Can it truly be deemed "scientific" to search for the social origins of phenomena by collating sundry static portraits of societies, as is done here with ancient Israel (Era of the Judges), Egypt (Middle Kingdom), Rome (Age of Augustus), Zulu (after Shaka), and the Blackfoot (post-horse)? Swanson's book is in fact singularly mistitled, for while correlations drawn from "facts" methodically sundered from the circumscriptions of time and milieu pile up in profusion, no causal or genetic analysis is ever attempted. And just as this procedure yields such findings as "plentifulness of the food supply . . . shows a positive relationship to monotheism" (1960: 77), so by the same method one could presumably find that in several advanced European societies "plentifulness of the food supply shows a positive relationship to atheism." Uninformed by the logic of contextual explanation - what Popper termed a "situational logic" - whereby phenomena are understood and explained by tracing their intrinsic relations to other mediating structures and processes, one can find all kinds of correlations, but with little capacity to separate the spurious from the genuine. Little wonder, then, that the bane of quantitative sociology up to this point has been what Sorokin (1956) unerringly labelled "coefficient misbehavior," for depending upon the classificatory criteria and the assumptions brought to the inquiry, one can extract from contextually dispossessed data virtually what one pleases. 14 As these methodological flaws are intrinsic to the positivistic program, there is no need to provide additional illustrations by examining Swanson's identical treatment of other religious dimensions. Comment is required, however, regarding his manner of handling negative evidence. Although the conclusions to most chapters purport to have uncovered "positive and significant" relations, the respective tables of findings can often be read quite differently. For example, in the chapter on ancestral spirits, where Swanson predicts that "active ancestrals" will be found in societies with "sovereign kinship organizations" (lineages, clans, etc.), he claims a significant confirmation for his thesis -notwithstanding that fully half of the societies without such organizations also feature those beliefs! Swanson likewise claims strong support for his thesis that witchcraft is likely to occur whenever important interactions take place "in the absence of legitimated social controls," but this too seems to be a finding largely created by the manner of classification. Having scaled the prevalence of witchcraft into the 14. To cite but one pertinent example: Underhill (1975), employing similar methods on a similar (though larger) sample of ethnographic data, but approaching the subject from a Marxian perspective, found that economic factors were more strongly correlated with monotheism than were political ones. See also Swanson's defiant response (1975), charging Underhill with errors in classification, and Underhill's rejoinder, blasting Swanson for "a serious misinterpretation of statistical data" (1976: 421). For a judicious discussion of the problems and prospects related to this "radical underdetermination of models by data" and the chronic "high level of slack between measures and theoretical concepts," consult Stephen P. Turner (1987). 43</page><page sequence="16">categories high-intermediate-low, Swanson highlights the fact that only one society lacking "unlegitimated contacts" features high witchcraft, compared to seventeen which conform to his expectation. What he conspicuously fails to mention is that there are also fourteen societies lacking unlegitimated contacts which nonetheless feature intermediate witchcraft. Similar difficulties and "grey areas" beset the chapters on reincarnation, immanence of the soul, and the relations between morality and supernatural sanctions. In a handful of cases Swanson suggests that misclassification might be responsible for the negative evidence, but this would still leave rather significant percentages of discordance for some propositions, and hence insufficient grounds for inferring relations of causality.5 As Blalock (1984: 44) has tellingly observed with regard to quanti- tative methods in general: One temptation in the face of this lack of dramatic results is to exaggerate the importance of small differences and to place the emphasis on statistical significance and probability levels rather than on magnitudes of relationships and explained variance. The final chapter of Swanson's book is given over to criticizing several alternative theories in the light of his findings. He dismisses, for example, the notion that religious beliefs are compensatory "fantasies" on the familiar Durkheimian grounds that such beliefs must correspond to real not illusory social forces (Marx's views on religion as alienation go unnoticed); but more interest- ing is Swanson's contention that while deprivations do not account for the origins of religious beliefs, he does allow that such beliefs might subsequently be put to compensatory use. Irrespective of the soundness of Swanson's reasoning here, what needs underscoring is the fact that his methodology- based exclusively upon static correlations - provides no evidence whatsoever that would allow for the determination of genetic priorities of this sort. Swanson' s dismissal of naturistic theories is also logically suspect, inasmuch as his argument that natural forces are not everywhere deified can just as easily be applied to his own model, for in no instance did he find invariant relations among his variables. In short, the hard evidence Swanson claims to have provided is in large measure an artifact of his orienting theoretical assumptions and his "strip- mining" methodology. To clarify these points further, let us briefly consider how that "prototheorist" Max Weber addressed the problems of historical- comparative sociology. Rather than uniformly impose deductive schemata upon historically and culturally diverse realities, Weber developed his nuanced concepts and generalizations through the most detailed probings of the empirical record, closely adhering to that logic of contextual analysis which alone allows 15. A close examination of Appendix III (pp. 222-26) reveals rather alarming disagreements in the coding: of thirty-nine variables, fully thirteen feature discordancy levels of 50 percent or greater for the randomly selected subset of twenty societies which were subjected to a reliability check by Swanson's two graduate assistants. 44</page><page sequence="17">for both meaningful understanding and causal explanation. When Weber lays bare the social psychologies of the world religions, for example, he identifies not only the creators and carriers of the respective beliefs, but also situates each religious development within a wider constellation of determinant social forces, all of which is understood historically, dynamically. Compare such a mode of analysis with Swanson's single variable, two-stage (before and after) account of the Reformation in Religion and Regime (1967), a study hailed by many sociologists as an exemplary triumph of theory and method, but roundly dismissed by historians as a vacuous scholastic exercise untrue to the raging realities on the ground.16 As in Swanson's earlier work, one finds ubiquitous correlations juxtaposing various political arrangements with theological differ- ences, but again no explication of the actual causal mechanisms involved. In place of process and specified forms of human agency, we are offered a stark correspondence or "reflection" notion, in this case holding that centralized, intrusive polities will foster beliefs (osmotically?) in an immanent deity (Ca- tholicism), while pluralistic polities will favour a transcendental god (Protestant- ism). Swanson, it should be noted, felt entitled to denigrate Weber's Protestant Ethic as "bad science from the start" (1971: 263), but what is one to say of a methodology which systematically overrides historical and cultural complexi- ties in the interests of standard operationalizations so tenuously tethered to the concrete? The minimal conclusion to be drawn from the preceding comparisons, I offer, is that those who would consign Marx and Weber to the footnotes should seriously reconsider their presumption. Ultimately more important of course is the question of whether the natural sciences furnish a reliable model for sociological inquiry. Nothing in the foregoing should encourage such a view. Contrary to the foundational premise of positivism, the essential facts of social life cannot be analyzed as discrete and uniform units - thereby reducible to determinate quanta that allow for the kinds of mathematical operations that are employed in the physical sciences - since they are not only embedded within a confluence of mediating socio-cultural factors and processes, but also deeply immersed in the variable conditioning rhythms of time. Standardizing or atomizing procedures are commonplace in the natural sciences, but even there their efficacy and legitimacy is restricted to domains where the continua of natural phenomena are essentially uniform, stable, homogeneous - cases where, as Collingwood (1946) felicitously noted, "Nature stays put." A science that investigates the social life of the human animal, that most variable of variables, can rarely - if ever - afford to construct its methods and formulate its theories on a similar ontological assumption. 16. For an introduction to the critical literature, consult the special review symposium in the Journal of nterdisciplinary History, especially the articles by Natalie Davis (1971) and Theodor Brodek (1971), with Swanson's attendant reply to these and other objections. For a rare critique of Swanson's methods offered by a sociologist, see Wuthnow (1987). 45</page><page sequence="18">The positivist therapeutic: A dissenting opinion Operationally unambiguous concepts, mathematically specified relationships among variables, falsifiable theories, and covering laws - such is the regimen that Lenski, Blalock, Turner, and others prescribe for the various "deficiencies" that allegedly forestall the formulation of truly scientific theories in our disci- pline. The fact that virtually identical cures have been bandied about for years by such eminent scholars as Giddings, Ogburn, Lundberg, Stouffer, Lazarsfeld, Homans, Zetterberg, and numerous others, would seem to warrant a more self- critical awareness on the part of recent advocates, but then, as Kuhn (1970) has documented, commitments to the prevailing paradigm seem notoriously resist- ant to challenge.17 Much of Lenski's argument is taken up with comparisons of various styles of research, with assessments pro and con pointing the way to a decidedly positivistic strategy for salvation. We have already seen the "prototheorists" derided for an alleged laxity in scientific standards, but another figure pilloried for conceptual ambiguity and operational deficiencies is Talcott Parsons, whose actual shortcomings are instructive in ways unappreciated by his critic. For Lenski takes Parsons to task not for his ahistorical theorizing, his ambition to formulate that "general theory" which Lenski himself regards as the benchmark of any true science, but rather for sundry technical failings, his presumed lack of rigor in theory construction. Now whatever else one may say of Parsons, to suggest that a sloppiness of mind and method prevented this undeniably erudite and serious scholar from attaining his goals is simply preposterous. Parsons' failures are in fact those that inhere in the very enterprise of grand or "general theory," for if one seeks to build an analytical model which will encompass "all the more important uniformities and variations in all known societies," then terminological opacity and distance from the empirical are precisely the qualities required for this Sisyphean labour. Lenski's commitment to positivistic principles also constrains his discussion of Blau and Duncan's American Occupational Structure (1967), a work said to merit special praise for "the precision and clarity with which its basic theoretical argument was set forth" (1988:166). After commenting that subsequent research has nonetheless revealed the model's incompleteness, Lenski adds the follow- ing: Critics have also shown that the theory is far from being a general theory of social stratification. For example, while it explains a considerable part of the process by which individuals are distributed 17. Cf. Gellner's "The alchemists of sociology" (1959); and for fuller documentation, Mills's The Sociological Imagination (1959), and Andreski's Social Sciences as Sorcery (1972). Wiley's "The rise and fall of dominating theories in American sociology" (1979) provides pertinent information regarding the logistical ascendancy of positivism in controlling the discipline's "means of intellectual production." 46</page><page sequence="19">among various occupations in modem industrial societies, it does not explain how different occupations have come to be associated with different levels of rewards in various societies, or in a single society at various times in its history. Also, it provides few clues to the causes of changes in the status attainment process itself. But once again, the clarity of the model makes it easy to recognize these limitations. (1988:167) One need not be much of a logician in order to realize that the manifest flaws and the alleged virtues of which Lenski speaks are unhappily bound in tandem: i.e., that a simple and therefore "incomplete" sociological model will exhibit "pre- cision and clarity" precisely to the extent that it sacrifices comprehensiveness and realism, whereas investigations that adhere to the logic of contextual analysis will indeed be complex and nuanced, but for all that much more faithful to the facts. The trade-offs between abstracting and concretizing procedures must of course be assessed ever anew with reference to the subjects investigated, but the record to date leaves no doubt that when sociology turns to formalism and simplified models, explanatory infirmities and gross distortions of reality are the typical results. Lenski's appeal to path diagramming in this context does nothing to resolve such difficulties, for what value can there possibly be in presenting an elaborate causal model gridlocked by a convoluted maze of interaction lines and feedback loops linking all the essential factors (very popular in our journals, these days), or alternatively, simplified versions which, for that very reason, neither confuse nor enlighten? Onus probandi, and a closing plea for constructive debate Timely declamations in the future tense may have served the advocates of positivism well in deflecting the force of direct criticism, but the downside to this perpetual circumvention now presses for requital: the burden of proof, onus probandi, rests rather disproportionately on their shoulders, particularly in light of the advancing age of their promises and their penchant for deriding the scientific contributions of others. Scholars who work in the historical- comparative traditions of Marx and Weber, on the other hand, need feel no concern or embarrassment over the conspicuous absence of universal laws or "general theories" which explain everything everywhere anytime, since they recognize that objects which possess "consciousness and wills" and "extraordi- narily complex cultural traditions" do not behave - or more accurately, act - in ways that lend themselves to such specifications. The positivist's anxiety regarding the "muddled state" of sociological theory likewise fails to alarm, for although "proliferation" is indeed a reality, the problem has less to do with any lack of empirical testing than with the jejune offerings of those who have been methodically trained to shackle their imaginations to the dictates of path diagramming, mathematical sociology, and the other standard trappings of formal "theory construction." Far from being alarmed about a lack of progress, historical sociologists can point to a cumulation of knowledge which the 47</page><page sequence="20">positivist seeks but never achieves, for on a wide range of issues impressive advances have undoubtedly taken place: the social origins of the moder nation- state, the rise and spread of Christianity, the causes of revolutions and other forms of collective protest, the transition from feudalism to capitalism, the relationships between plagues and peoples, the social foundations of millenarian beliefs and organizations -on these and a host of other subjects, scholars whose research proceeds from the principle that a decontextualized, detemporalized social science is no science at all, have extended the frontiers of our understand- ing by producing a steady yield of new information, penetrating insights, and expansive perspectives. In contrast, consider the plight of those who strive to transfer the analytical procedures of alien disciplines to their own: not only will they seek in their theories that invariance and uniformity which social reality invariably denies, they will search after that knowledge with simulated methods ill-suited to the nature of their quest. The recently published volume of essays edited by Jonathan Turner, Theory Building in Sociology (1989), offers a timely opportunity for assessing "theoreti- cal cumulation" in the positivist tradition. Although the editor lauds the contribu- tors for their "creative leaps," this judgment is rather partisan, since most of the work presented here has long been subject to extensive criticism within sociol- ogy. I venture to say that there is not a single "law" or "proposition" advanced in these essays that would command majority assent within the discipline, let alone the social sciences. If not commonplace or tautological, most of the purported analytical breakthroughs are highly contentious or dubious. Here is a representative sample of "laws" and "principles": In sum, differentiation and interdependence are essential features of social structure. There is no social structure if all elements are completely homogeneous, and neither is there one if the elements are entirely unconnected. The process of social interaction and social mobility that link the elements also furnish the dynamics that engender recurrent structural change. (Blau, 1989: 46) [W]henever people are faced with two divergent courses of action - one in pursuit of some individual end, the other in pursuit of some collective end - it is assumed that they will always choose the former. (Hechter, 1989: 66) The more social structures are produced and reproduced via political action, conflict and domination, the more their transformation will proceed in the direction of most serving those actors who are most able to accumulate power to dominate in the conflict. (Miinch, 1989: 112) The gravamen of this critique has been to show that the proponents of positivism have provided no scientific basis for their naturalistic principles, having either illegitimately evaded all consideration of the unique ontological status of social phenomena (and hence the epistemological issues attendant thereto), or having erroneously assumed that a program of methodological monism can be erected over heterogeneous ontological domains. In place of proofs and reasons, we are instructed to simply marvel at the manifest superiority 48</page><page sequence="21">of the "natural sciences" (oft presented in dated Newtonian guise), and to refashion our theories and methods accordingly. 1 The great irony in all this is the fact that the conversion so incessantly called for would entail a bizarre form of inverse alchemy: for while it is manifestly true that the natural sciences were set on the royal road to progress by purging from their fields an age-old inheritance of anthropomorphic characterizations, it should be equally plain that nothing could be more absurd than for students of the social sciences to follow suit and, in positivistic fashion, "eliminate anthropomorphism from the study of anthropos as well" (Andreski, 1969: 55-6). In consideration of the fact that this methodological controversy has resisted resolution for so long, it stands to reason that any renewed effort at clarification should begin by identifying the sources of stalemate, and in this respect Lenski' s paradigmatic restatement of the positivistic faith is particularly instructive. For the most striking aspect of his presentation is its manifest inability to face - let alone rebut - the criticisms posed by the opponents of a naturalistic social science. Whenever Lenski verges on the point of addressing the primary ontological objections to his program, he promptly retreats to the secondary stage of method and theory construction, allowing the formal requirements of the latter (as understood positivistically!) to overrule the substantive imperatives of the former.'9 This manner of evasion, I offer, exemplifies the basic argumenta- tive strategy of those in the positivistic camp, and it knows a number of rhetorical variations: from Lundberg's (1947) contention that we are still "chipping flint in the Stone Age of our science" (a plea for patience that is surely wearing thin now that most of us have joined the computer age); to Nagel's (1961) forlorn defense that it is logically impermissible to rule out future discoveries of invariant social laws (even while conceding that past experience and numerous formidable practical obstacles give no grounds for optimism); and now, most recently, Lenski's thesis of complacency and negligence in the arena of theory construc- tion (a view neither plausible nor charitable given the seriousness of purpose with which the positivistic program has been pursued in mainstream sociology). Conspicuously absent from all such defenses is the sine qua non of their legitimacy: i.e., a clear demonstration that the theories sought after and the 18. Machlup's important essay, "Are the social sciences really inferior?" (1963), should be mandatory reading before any evaluations are made regarding the scientific status of the two fields. 19. For yet another offering which seeks to resolve the basic problems in sociology via the formalistic dictates of mathematical theory construction, likewise uninformed by any kind of reasoning about the ontology of social phenomena, see Jasso (1988). If many of her mathematically derived predictions seem somewhat removed from reality, this is no doubt due to her concern that knowledge of the "facts" might "obstruct the path of pure derivation." Hence the following proposed division of intellectual labour: "It is the peculiar mission of the empirical analyst to examine predictions empirically; for the theorist, empirical insights might get in the way" (1988: 10). Might not this "axiom" be fairly rendered as Ignorance = Theoretical Bliss? 49</page><page sequence="22">methods employed are appropriate to the subject-matter investigated, a defense which must begin by showing that the intentional and meaningful agency of human beings can be treated in like manner as such events as occur within subatomic fields, protoplasmic complexes, or stellar systems. I forego belaboring the inherent futility of such an exercise, on the hopefully sound assumption that there can be few serious scholars today who would be willing to defend either the mechanical materialism of La Mettrie and Holbach or the crude behaviorism of Watson and Skinner - the kinds of ontologies which are of course required if positivism is to be scientifically rather than ideologically sustained. No doubt the reaction to this critique will be as uneven as that occasioned by the recent spate of encomia on behalf of greater positivistic rigor, the polarity between such responses bearing witness to the depth of the methodological rupture that lies at the core of our discipline. The foregoing commentary has endeavoured to go beyond mere verbal exhortation, however, by actually specifying a series of argumentative failings and substantive flaws that are inherent in the positivistic program. And as the naturalistic strategy stands suspect by the mere fact that its devotees must repeatedly call for yet greater rigor and still more patience, I accordingly suggest that if we seek a true renaissance in the social sciences, we would do well to recognize that the rich legacy of historical-comparative scholarship bequeathed by Marx and Weber - which does allow for knowledge cumulation precisely because it comprehends rather than deforms its object of study - that legacy remains underutilized, while an arid scholasticism of formalistic theory and pseudo-scientific method continues to dissipate the imaginative energies of far too many in our profession. It is a testimony to their integrity that scholars like Lenski, Lieberson, Duncan, and Blalock openly express their deep concerns and candidly identify many of the ills plaguing our discipline; but if - as I have sought to show - their diagnoses and therapies fail by reason of kindred maladies, we must obviously widen our search for the requisite cures. So long as our efforts at rethinking remain reassuringly bound by those orienting first principles which are them- selves spared the testing fire of criticism, then surely the nemesis of dogmatic obscurantism and rampant sophistry will be our fate.
