      <p>Recent discussions of computer-based artistic practices have tended to focus on the relationship between the real and the virtual—invoking this problematic binary even while they attempt to undo it—and the destabilization of the referent in digital image production. In discussions related to computer technologies, the idea of code, and specifically binary, has been a central focus of critical attention as the common feature to all. Conceiving binary as a zero-sum game, an all-or-nothing form of representation, seemed to precipitate a crisis in theories of human-machine interactions in the mid-1990s. This period saw numerous artists and theorists attempting to work through the problems associated with the subject’s supposedly disembodied interaction with an abstract plane of representation composed of code and grappling with the concept of an endless proliferation of digitally manipulated images no longer attached to the material and political terrain of the real (Robins 1996; Johnson 1997; Sommer 2002). The spatial metaphors of cyberspace and traditional interface technology have served a key role in this transformation of the subject into code, since they implicitly relate back both to Enlightenment models of vision, in which the subject is at the perceived center of a perspectively rendered matrix, and to a form of Cartesian mapping in which digits (or the grid of pixels) provide coordinates for plotting the self or, indeed, the self-image.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>As a series of 1s and 0s, binary is a form of representation that made it all too easy for the new information image to be cut, pasted, transformed, or generated from nothing. Such ideas intersected with the knowledge of genetics emerging in the 1990s, resulting in a perceived equivalence between binary and genetic code that aggravated critical discourse to the point where the human subject (whatever that may have been) was considered to be in a state of crisis.<sup>2</sup> DNA, like text, could also be cut and pasted to produce new formations. This question of the subject as code, however, has now become somewhat overdetermined and speaks to a technologically deterministic model of subjectivity.</p>
      <p>Given the importance of histories of the body for second-wave and constructivist feminists, it is unsurprising that much of the debate surrounding the subject as code intersects with the overlapping discourses of feminism and science and technology studies, often in conflicting ways.<sup>3</sup> For example, the model of equivalence and interchangeability, premised on code, has accounted in sophisticated ways for the mechanisms by which bodies and artifacts become integrated into the structures of capital, by making everything dis- and rejoinable (Braidotti 1994). Conversely, the most significant contribution, at least in the terms set by this article, has been the sustained challenge to theories of information as a system of free-floating signs that move, unchanged, between different material substrates (Hayles 1999; Chun 2011). The focus on information theory is crucial here since it makes explicit that this is not just a question of representation but one of ontology: N. Katherine Hayles has shown that the condition of disembodiment on which the virtual subject was premised replicated the liberal subject of the Enlightenment (1999, 4–5). This reconceptualization of information theory is part of an important discursive thread, growing since the 1980s, that introduced a contextual specificity into science and technology studies by seeking to establish a phenomenological encounter between subject and world in order to reclaim a ground on which identity could be theorized. Core examples include theories of embodiment (Braidotti 1994; Grosz 1994; Hayles 1999), oppositional consciousness (Haraway 1988, 1991; Sandoval 1991), and, more recently, intra-action (Barad 2007).</p>
      <p>It is in this spirit that my article hopes to speak to the very real problems of digital forms of representation—a fraught terrain in this economy of signs—and yet simultaneously to speak beyond them. The competing discourses of the real and the virtual can no longer claim the digital under the rubric of either structure; they can only reveal the discursive logics behind attempting to do so. Through the critical practice of the artist and academic Nell Tenhaaf, I hope to stage an encounter between the clashing metaphorics and politics of the semiotic and the material in order to conceive of the digital, beyond these terms, as fundamentally spatial. By analyzing the reciprocal relationship between ground and representation, in other words the con-text (the ground that supports and gives meaning to the sign), we might begin to develop an account of the encounter between the subject and the digital. An important aspect of this analysis will therefore be focused on the new modes of interface hardware and software that Tenhaaf deploys. The purpose of this is threefold: in the first instance, I hope to use Tenhaaf’s work as a recent example of how digital ontology is being questioned through representation. Second, I intend to show that replacing the paradigm of the body need not suggest a virtual flight into technophilic fantasies of transcendence or, to use Eugene Thacker’s term, “extropianism” (2003, 73). Thus, finally, I hope that by reconceiving of binary not as a linear series but as a spatial field, we might disconnect binary from its self-limiting association with the binaries of Western thought.</p>

         <title>Biotech to info-tech</title>
         <p>Since the late 1980s, Tenhaaf’s work has focused on the perceived links between information technology and biotechnology and, as described in the introduction to this article, the culture of linguistic and semiotic equivalences that has made such links possible. By inhabiting a frustrated margin between the virtual and the material, the work has alluded to the impossibility of asserting such binaries. During the 1980s and 1990s, media representations of biological research became increasingly genetically deterministic, resulting in what Tenhaaf has described as a “code fixation” (2003b, 365). She defines code fixation as an “attention to genetics at the expense of environment, or the supremacy of DNA ruling the somatic matrix in a way that parallels how the (rational) masculine has historically ruled the (irrational) feminine” (365). As such, her work over the last two and a half decades has drawn on a variety of visual registers, incorporating computer technologies, medical imaging, and drawing in order to question these practices and their impact on constructions of gender and identity.</p>
         <p>Tenhaaf has described her 1989 project <italic>Species Life</italic> (fig. 1) as the work that initially relocated her practice from database projects, which questioned the ethics of networked communications, toward an investigation of technological practices of embodiment, a term that I flesh out during the course of this discussion. This passage from infotechnology to biotechnology was an attempt to question the idea of coding, to think through the cultural and social mechanisms by which the coded body became bound up with constructions of gender (Tenhaaf 2003b, 365). In this work, rectangular light boxes show a sequence of digitally processed images of a man and a woman, hand in hand on a hill, looking out toward a sunset. Swirling beneath them are pink and blue strands of DNA with computer-generated but hand-printed passages of text from Friedrich Nietzsche and Luce Irigaray crawling up the strands of the DNA of the man and the woman, respectively. Juxtaposing handicraft and digital images, the will to power is opposed to an ethics of care. Similarly, in the 1993 installation <italic>In Vitro (The Perfect Wound)</italic>, Tenhaaf again used light boxes to display the twenty-three chromosomes that supposedly determine sexual development superimposed over images of two glass beakers containing the barely perceptible figures of the Virgin Mary and a wounded Jesus Christ (fig. 2).<fig id="fg1" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>Such works were early attempts at exposing the way that both genetics and the book of Genesis presumed that our destiny was inscribed at the moment of conception. They also sought to question the way gender had been ascribed to these different mythologies and the formulation of a medical gaze that transformed material bodies into bodies of knowledge: analyzed and made legible through charts, graphs, and tables.<sup>4</sup> Tenhaaf has written, “I am trying to insert into this location the subject position of the individual and how they actually live out the myth of genetics, as opposed to how it lives in them” (2003a, 53). As Kim Sawchuk (2003) has noted, the message of these works was particularly important at a historical moment when, as a result of advances in biomedicine, there was a reinvigorated focus on biology as the cause of sex and, subsequently, gender differences. Looking at these works now, not only must we acknowledge the complex use of various forms of image production in the early stages of their development (digital processing, computer-generated images, medical images, and hand printing all used in combination with one another), but we must also acknowledge these works’ role in highlighting a particular moment in the history of the representation of biology and information technology (15). Such works served as an important foil to mainstream images of science at the time, and they perhaps enable us to more clearly perceive artistic practice’s recent move away from an interest in the flesh-machine hybrid bodies of the 1990s (Stelarc and Orlan are frequently cited examples here) and toward the question of how subjectivity is rearticulated through forms of digital representation.<sup>5</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Tenhaaf’s most recent project, <italic>Lo-Fi</italic> (undertaken in collaboration with Melanie Baljko from 2005 to 2010), has extended this investigation into the relationship between the subject and digital representation, deploying alternative interface hardware and modes of abstraction (figs. 3 and 4). The 2009 sculpture <italic>Push/Pull</italic>, developed as part of the broader <italic>Lo-Fi</italic> project, is an interactive artificial life (A-life) artwork in which clusters of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are used to represent encounters between computer-generated and live subjects, interacting with one another through sound and movement. In this sculpture, the screen of a computer has essentially been replaced by a grid of fiber-optic cables connected to the LEDs, which stand in as functional alternatives to a grid of pixels. An overhead camera senses the position of individuals around the sculpture, and sensors produce information that is fed to software that controls the on or off positions of the LEDs. The resulting pattern of LEDs is formed by the encounter between the information produced by the live subjects and the autonomous but responsive artificial agents: computer-generated subjects that are formally indistinguishable from the LED representation of any organism in the sculpture’s environment (Baljko and Tenhaaf 2008, 2).<fig id="fg3" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>This work, I propose, does not simply represent a model of the digital or, as outlined above, the theoretical problems associated with invoking the real/virtual binary. Rather, it employs representation as a device that can account for an encounter between the subject and the digital, which, as I argue, unfolds onto questions of perceived agency and autonomy. The LEDs do not represent the subject in that they do not function as some kind of index of the subject’s presence (i.e., its position in the room) or, in other words, perform a one-to-one mapping of the subject onto its representation (and, subsequently, the ultimate displacement of that subject in postmodernism). <italic>Push/Pull</italic> might speak to the discursive formation of the subject as representation, but it ultimately problematizes it. Part of this problematization derives from the way in which the subject is not simply transferred and translated into an information system that then functions autonomously, but, rather, this transfer occurs in a perpetual loop continually thrown off-kilter by the subject’s reaction to the information as it is represented. The LEDs are not just a representation of the encounter but are, simultaneously, both the encounter itself and an account of the material conditions in which the encounter takes place.</p>
         <p>We might consider these material conditions as including the room in which the encounter occurs, the hardware and software that process and display the information, and the sculptural body itself: all sites of possible interference. We might, therefore, gather such material conditions together in terms of the notion of contingency. The contingency of both the subject (its position in the room) and the artificial agent recombine with the contingency of the processing software and the display hardware, so that, in the process of recombination, these compounded material conditions affect the correlative relation between the subject and the LEDs. As such, the perception of autonomy—of either the subject in the installation environment or the artificial agent—is displaced by the contingency of material conditions. What is represented then, finally, are the contingencies involved in the constitution of a subject position. It is the negotiation between one’s subjectivity, that of the artificial agent’s, and the material conditions that comprise the transformation of the encounter into a digital display. Such a representation is clearly tied to misinterpretation: we cannot assume that the LEDs simply represent us or that we can interact with the sculpture accordingly, since the subject is not just displayed in-formation (with the inflection both of data and of order). We must instead negotiate the space between agency and action (what we hope to achieve and what we actually achieve), as imagined autonomy is replaced by the contingency of the encounter. Rather than high-resolution replication, simulation, and likeness, the new metaphorical space that Tenhaaf’s work enables the digital to inhabit is, as I argue, the space of failure, misinterpretation, and potentiality.</p>

         <title>Interface</title>
         <p>This analysis of the LEDs lays the foundation for a move toward rethinking the traditional graphical user interface (GUI) as inclusive of the contingencies of its production, which I have here conceived as material. As I argue, if the anthropomorphisms of traditional interface technologies have historically smoothed over contingency and naturalized the interaction between subject and machine, <italic>Push/Pull</italic> assertively rejects this anthropomorphism (the habituation of the subject in the desktop) and instead acts to highlight what is contingent, mismatched, and nontransferable. By allowing a flow between embodied action and perception, <italic>Push/Pull</italic> speaks to the prefix of the term “interface”: it is among, amid, or between subjects. Pushing, pulling, it is more rigorously interactive than the conventional GUI.</p>
         <p>These conceptual differences spring directly from formal ones. The brass mesh grid of the sculpture (figs. 5–6), threaded with bluntly cut off fiber-optic cables, has an undulating topology that presents a challenge to the hard, flat surface of the traditional computer screen and resonates with the artist’s research interest in haptic technologies (Tenhaaf 2008). It is worth thinking for a moment about what this new interface represents, historically, in terms of the emergence of the computer as a primarily visual entity.<sup>6</sup>

         <p>Developed at Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center during the 1970s, and subsequently popularized in the mass market by Apple (then Apple Macintosh), the GUI is a user-friendly graphics-based front-end environment that enables the user to run a variety of applications at the same time. Its most distinguishing feature, in the context of this article, is the ability to graphically file information in a 3-D setting, also known as nesting. The type of seeing that the GUI deploys serves to reflect back an idea of a coherent subject; the plane of representation is understood as the ground for a set of Cartesian coordinates against which the movements of a self—whatever that may be—can always be plotted. Conceiving of the GUI as a space has allowed us to try to secure our own position in relation to the technology, to be able to say “I am here.” In the GUI environment, the subject is constructed in and through the spatial metaphorics of computer vision. The anatomical eye of rods and cones and optic nerves is conflated with the “I” of traditional philosophical inquiry.</p>
         <p>Unlike in DOS (disk operating system), knowledge of code is not necessary, since the text systems that drive the programs run in the background of the GUI without the user’s knowledge. While this creates a level of accessibility that contributed enormously to the rise of the personal computer, it also crystallizes the sense of the computer as a “black box,” an engineering term that describes an object for which knowledge of its workings has been superseded by knowledge that it’s working (Gere 1996). This harkens back to an empirical tradition in which the subject can be both the site of knowledge’s production (the body) and its apprehension (vision). In this tradition, the conditions of visibility and invisibility are in perpetual tension with knowledge. We might thus liken technology to the somatic body in terms of Drew Leder’s model of dys-appearance: the idea that the body, and the default condition of not knowing it, is paradoxically only ever made visible when something is not working (Leder 1990). Under this rubric, the ontology of the computer tends toward the instrumental.</p>
         <p>In <italic>Push/Pull</italic>, by contrast, it is almost as if the viscera of the technological body have been exposed, opening up the functional space where computing takes place for all to see, as if insisting that to see is to know. But rather than repeating the paradigm, the sculpture plays off it. Fiber-optic cables, traditionally used to see into the body, here become the substance of the technological body. The body of the computer—that paradigm of the higher functions of knowledge production—is revealed to be composed of nothing but vision itself, the paradigmatic apparatus of knowledge apprehension. Again, the question of representation is brought to the fore of my analysis of <italic>Push/Pull</italic>. The sculpture thus speaks to a history of the interface that is deeply conflicted: a site of simultaneous concealing and revealing; a screen that is both a surface on which to display images and a means by which to shield them from view. Yet here, that literal and metaphorical device has been prized apart, forcing both its internal workings and the very practice of screening into full view.</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Push/Pull</italic> seems to invoke this conflicted history, formally standing as a monument to machines from the prehistory of the personal computer, from a time before the mass of cables, switches, and printouts were screened by GUIs. <italic>Push/Pull</italic> is not a black box; it exposes itself for everyone to see. But if <italic>Push/Pull</italic> is a sort of monument to early computers such as the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), Mark I, and UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer), then it is also necessarily a monument to the history of women in computing. Before the development of operating systems, now inextricably fused with GUIs and brand identities, women operated these systems. As Wendy Hui Kyong Chun has written, “today the clerical ‘operators’ who planned the wiring for and wired the ENIAC (Kathleen McNulty, Frances Bilas, Betty Jean Jennings, Elizabeth Snyder, Ruth Lichterman, and Marilyn Wescoff) are reclaimed as some of the earliest programmers” (2005, 29). In her important work, Chun has charted how the development of operating systems (which no longer required variables to be set by hand) generated a shift through which programmers came to displace operators along a gendered axis.</p>
         <p>Although the work of Chun, Julie Wosk, and Sadie Plant has successfully integrated women into histories of technology—looking to telephonists, typists, and secretaries, as well as individuals such as Grace Murray Hopper and Ada Lovelace—these studies largely suggest an alignment of women with instrumental models of both technology and subjectivity: women are the operators but never the programmers (Plant 1997, 2000; Wosk 2001; Chun 2005). By contrast, the work of Sherry Turkle, Rosi Braidotti, and Faith Wilding is somewhat more ambivalent about how women might be reinserted into such histories. For these writers and artists, it is not enough that women have had a history of using technology; we must also acknowledge that that history itself might well be a reflection or repetition of forms of oppression that need to be unpicked and understood (Turkle 1984, 1997; Braidotti 1996; Wilding 1998). As Braidotti wrote in her influential 1996 essay “Cyberfeminism with a Difference,” “Western culture reiterates its habit of organizing things hierarchically at times of the greatest technological advance. And so it is that as technology progresses, and gives women the means by which to negotiate new and complex forms of subjectivity, the gap between men and women in computer literacy and participation in programming and design continues to widen” (1996, 20). Where critical art practice can make a unique contribution in this field, therefore, is to engender an alternative history in which women actually develop and access technology in sophisticated ways, as programmers, hackers, and software developers: art practice can perform seismic shifts in the popular metaphorics of technology.</p>
         <p>In the 1990s, Braidotti called on cyberfeminists, including Tenhaaf, to entirely reconfigure women’s relationship to technology by rejecting the instrumentality implied by the GUI and WIMP (window-icon-mouse-pointer) systems, whose functional role had been to represent those very systems to users and to represent users back to themselves. By working beneath the level of the interface, Braidotti argued, cyberfeminists might stage a challenge to the ways in which these systems have abstracted the user from the material workings of the computer. This challenge, as I have been arguing, clearly remains one of the central projects of Tenhaaf’s work nearly two decades later, in that the <italic>Push/Pull</italic> project uses alternative interface hardware in order to give rise to new forms of representation. In refusing the flat surface of the screen and representing the encounter between live subject and artificial agent as a cluster of LEDs, the work speaks beyond the paradigm of screen-as-mirror, in which the conventions of figurative representation are endlessly repeated. It also displaces the sustained attempts to continually reintegrate the real-virtual binary into computer-based practices. In other words, <italic>Push/Pull</italic> suggests sidestepping the problem of formal likeness by rejecting the idea that there is a normative bodily standard, either real or imagined, on which an avatar or body simulation might have been modeled. The use of LEDs thus specifically overturns anthropomorphism, which is often employed to elicit certain behaviors or relationships between real and virtual subjects and, in so doing, entrenches that binary further. As Baljko and Tenhaaf note, by challenging anthropomorphism one challenges the assumption that “everyone’s anthropomorphic gesture is equal and that the set of relations among human and virtual entities is the same for all users” (2008, 13). Again, the idea of the encounter is key: the question of anthropomorphism is not just a question of representation (do I look like <italic>x</italic>?) and affect (in what ways does this determine my interaction with <italic>x</italic>?) but one of ontology. In other words, are the metaphorics of Tenhaaf’s work strong enough to displace the perception that agency is intrinsically bound to hierarchies of identity that constitute, and are constituted by, both online and offline environments? What is at stake in detaching oneself from the many avatars that we inhabit on a daily basis in the spaces of social media, work, family, and home?</p>
         <p>It is worth thinking about Tenhaaf’s work in relation to other practices that have explored digital subjectivities and that, in so doing, have attempted to reconfigure the way in which the (usually human) subject might be represented, either through hyperrealistic simulation or exaggerated (but ultimately anthropocentric) difference. An early example of Internet-based artistic practice that has been richly analyzed in the literature is the 1995 project <italic>Bodies© INCorporated</italic>, developed at University of California, Los Angeles, by Victoria Vesna. This project used Virtual Reality Modeling Language to enable users at home to build a graphic representation of a virtual self or avatar and then deploy it into a networked space to interact with other avatars. The welcome statement reads, “Welcome to <italic>Bodies© INCorporated</italic>. The building elements at your disposal are ASCII text, simple geometric forms, TEXTures and low-resolution sound. Bodies built become your personal property, operating in and circulating through public space, free to be downloaded into your private hard drive/communication system at any time. The MOO/WOO functions as an institution through which your body gets shaped in the process of identity construction that occurs in, and mutually implicates, both the symbolic and material realms.”<sup>7</sup> This work was innovative in its very early use of graphics applications at a time when most online identities were constructed in text-based MUDs and for using the Internet as a means to network these bodies into something resembling a public space.<sup>8</sup> But its most radical feature was that it allowed bodies to be constructed using combinations of body parts and textures that seemed to operate beyond traditional categories of race and gender, thus avoiding the clichés and stereotyped representations that were, and remain, prevalent among online avatars.</p>
         <p>The project achieved this by enabling any body part to be constructed from one of the following textures: black rubber, blue plastic, bronze, chocolate, clay, cloudy, concrete, glass, lava, pumice, water, or wood. Each of these parts in turn was associated with a particular characteristic: for example, “lava is hot and dry; light that is trapped in matter; ‘perpetual fire’; with team leader sense,” while water is “cold and wet; dissolution, evaporation; strong relationship with gravity and heat; conceptual element.”<sup>9</sup> Although it has been remarked that these textures have unwittingly repeated stereotypes that perpetuate racial markers of identity, what both this work and the criticism of it develop is the relationship between the politics of identity construction and the processes of self-representation (Balsamo 2000; Nakamura 2000; González 2003). The act of representing one’s body or self not only forms a site from which a politics of identity can be articulated but also highlights that representation itself is always already informed by circulating ideologies of sexual, racial, and class difference.</p>
         <p>Given the limited technological capabilities for graphic representations in the mid-1990s, <italic>Bodies© INCorporated</italic> did seem to offer new, alternative modes of identity construction in the then-emerging Internet. However, I would suggest that, as for many subsequent projects that suggested that new technology offered the potential to enable the subject to align itself with its interior body image, <italic>Bodies© INCorporated</italic> was limited in its capacity to produce alternative representations because it formally referred back to the human body so closely in its choice of torso, head, two arms, and two legs (an anterior-posterior morphology). Furthermore, the body of <italic>Bodies© INCorporated</italic> wears its markers of difference so overtly that it only ever draws comparisons with an implied real body on the other side of the screen, reasserting the real/virtual binary even as it sought to redefine it. By contrast, Tenhaaf’s <italic>Lo-Fi</italic> project rejects the figural altogether and turns toward a form of abstraction—what she calls “low-fidelity embodiment” (Baljko and Tenhaaf 2008, 13)—in order to subvert and escape the clichés of computer-generated representations and question the relationship between body image and technological subjectivity (see Baljko and Tenhaaf 2006). Unlike a project such as <italic>Bodies© INCorporated</italic>, <italic>Push/Pull</italic> does this by deploying the highly abstracted form of LEDs in either an off or an on state (fig. 7). Tenhaaf writes, “Such low-fidelity embodiments stand in stark contrast to high-fidelity ones, such as humanoid-like, digitally rendered characters, and are preferable to use because they circumvent the clichés and expectations attached to humanoid characters, avatars, or (even worse) cartoons” (Baljko and Tenhaaf 2008, 14).<fig id="fg7" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>If, as I have already demonstrated in relation to the history of the GUI, the conventional desktop or laptop computer primarily operates under the rubric of an instrumentalized and hierarchical visuality, then <italic>Push/Pull</italic> offers an alternative model for interacting with the digital. It rejects both the hyperreal computer-generated representations that produce and reproduce high-fidelity images of the body and thus also the teleological assumption that the purpose of technology is to reproduce with ever-increasing fidelity. Mimesis and abstraction, key areas of long-standing concern in the literature on gender in scientific visual cultures, here play an important part in how Tenhaaf develops her model of embodiment.<sup>10</sup> Not only does mimesis serve to transform the subject into an object (of a scrutinizing, diagnostic gaze), but it also aligns technology with instrumentalizing theories. As such, it produces a double objectification of both the subject of representation and the technology itself. By challenging mimesis, Tenhaaf rejects those models of technology in which the (human) subject can be recorded and analyzed through ever-increasing fidelity of reproduction. By contrast, displacing hi-fi in favor of lo-fi points to the potentiality of abstraction in technologically mediated representations of the body, shifting the question away from theories of the body and technology toward embodiment. In so doing, the very framework of Tenhaaf’s investigation implies that the body is not distinct from technology and that terms such as “nature” and “culture” cannot be taken for granted. The political problems of representation inherent in imaging technologies that have traditionally staked a claim to an objective, anthropomorphic, or even anthropomorphizing point of view are here overturned as the technology itself becomes complicit in the formation of the subject that it seeks to represent, not distinct from it. Thus, Tenhaaf’s sculpture speaks to a more recent discourse that has emerged in feminism and science and technology studies, exemplified by Donna Haraway’s theory of “naturecultures” (2003, 1; 2008) or Karen Barad’s “intra-action” (2007, 33), that has argued that the subject never exists anterior to technology but that both are always involved in processes and cycles of mutual coconstitution.</p>
         <p>In displacing the body and mobilizing the concept of low-fidelity abstraction in the form of the LEDs, Tenhaaf presents a seductive challenge to figuration. However, the comparison to <italic>Bodies© INCorporated</italic> does reveal a certain iniquity in that Tenhaaf’s work appears unable to account for embodied enactments of difference. But we must remember that the pattern of lights produced by the LEDs is not a representation of the subject in the same way as the avatar one might construct in <italic>Bodies© INCorporated</italic> (a dematerialization of the body into image). It is rather a continual negotiation between two or more subjectivities (live or artificial) and the material conditions to which they are attached. The <italic>Push/Pull</italic> sculpture is not a simple displacement of the body in favor of an equally troubling paradigm—the reductive vision of the subject as code (as manifested solely by presence in opposition to absence). Instead it is an exploration of embodiment and its fundamental ties to questions of contingency and, as suggested at the outset, context. On this question of contingency, embodiment is the key term since it necessarily insists that the material world is always in operation even, and most especially, in the realm of digital technology and information transfer (on embodiment, see Braidotti 1994; Grosz 1994; Hayles 1999). Tenhaaf herself has described the work done in <italic>Push/Pull</italic> as being “context-dependent” (Baljko and Tenhaaf 2008, 5) and as a “coupling to [one’s] environment” (10) that results in a form of participatory action and dynamic interplay, which can be best described as “emergent” (5).</p>

         <title>The in-formation image</title>
         <p>In this exploration of the way in which the subject in <italic>Push/Pull</italic> is made manifest as contingency, thus tying it to the materiality of the work, I hope to open up a space in which to disrupt the exclusion of women that is implied by prevalent characterizations of information technology as transcendent in opposition to the immanence of the female body. Thus, in what follows, I would like to mobilize my analysis of the specifics of Tenhaaf’s work, expanding and extending the metaphorics that I have drawn from it into the wider terrain of the concept of binary. This shift from a micro- to a macroanalysis is spurred by the self-reflexivity of the work, since it can be read as an extended exploration of medium: not only does <italic>Push/Pull</italic> deploy digital modes of information processing, but it also represents this information as if it were analogous to the on/off positions of the LEDs.<sup>11</sup> It encourages us to fall for the analogy but then scrambles it along the way, reimagining binary in a context beyond Western binaries. As we have already seen, the pattern of light does not simply invoke the real in opposition to the virtual. Nor does the legibility of pattern, the in-formation that Hayles places in opposition to randomness, signal presence over absence (Hayles 1999). Instead, the on/off pattern of light represents a space of contingency in the negotiation between subjectivities and material specificities, but the on/off pattern does not hold within it the heavy metaphorics and metaphysics of Western binaries.</p>
         <p>Of course, in the context of digital electronic circuitry, binary will resist contingency and tend toward the ideal, as it is set to treat all signals, no matter how messy, as if they were the functional bit values 1 or 0. Thus, in order to resituate binary in this realm of contingency, even if only at the shifting level of metaphorics, we would do well to consider once again how the history of women and technology interlocks with the technology of gendered hierarchies of knowledge. In particular, it is in histories of weaving that the spatial emerges as a key site for destabilizing the relationship between binary and Western binaries.</p>
         <p>In the 1840s Ada Lovelace developed the Analytical Engine with Charles Babbage, taking inspiration from the punched cards of the Jacquard loom, which had been developed some forty years earlier. The loom worked on the basis of punched paper programs, designed as a code, to enable the highly complex patterns of textiles such as damask, brocade, and matelassé to be produced on a mass industrial scale. In this system, the loom was controlled by cards with punched holes, each row of which corresponded to one row of the design. Multiple rows of holes were punched on each card, and the many cards that composed the design of the textile were strung together in order. Although the Analytical Engine was something of an anachronism—it could not have been built at the time because the machines for making the component parts of the device would not be sophisticated enough to do so for another hundred years—the design formed the basis for the earliest computers, and systems of punch cards were still in use well into the programming culture of the 1970s (Essinger 2004). In her essay “On the Matrix: Cyberfeminist Simulations,” Plant (2000) demonstrated that computer technology was thus not only an invention by an individual woman, Lovelace, but, because of its relationship to weaving, ultimately an invention by women as a collectivity. She writes:<disp-quote>
               <p>If weaving has played such a crucial role in the history of computing, it is also the key to one of the most extraordinary sites of woman-machine interface that short-circuits their prescribed relationship and persists regardless of what man effects and defines as the history of technology. … In [Sigmund Freud’s] new introductory lectures on psychoanalysis, weaving and plaiting are the “only contributions to the history of discoveries and inventions” that [he] is willing to ascribe to women. He tells a story in which weaving emerges as a simulation of what he describes as a natural process, the matting of pubic hairs across the hole, the zero, the nothing to be seen. … It is because of women’s shame at the absence which lies where the root of their being should be that they cover up the disgusting wound, concealing the wandering womb of hysteria, veiling the matrix once and for all. This is a move which dissociates weaving from the history of science and technology, removing to a female zone both the woven and the networks and fine connective meshes of the computer culture into which it feeds. (332)</p>
            </disp-quote>As a protobinary system, the history of the Jacquard loom’s punch cards offers a way of folding the feminine back in to a field traditionally perceived as both male and masculine, as Plant suggests, and also speaks to the notion of contingency developed in Tenhaaf’s work. As in the sculpture <italic>Push/Pull</italic>, there is a sense in which binary systems can represent their own contingencies and operate in a visual economy that does not necessarily presume a detachment of the image from the terrain of the material. Rather than flattening out representation into a system of semiotic equivalence, the binary systems of both <italic>Push/Pull</italic> and the loom are transformative processes that weave in depth and complexity. The punch cards, a system of hole/not hole, provide an interesting point of encounter between the design for the textile and the cloth itself, which could be considered analogous to the point of encounter between the subject and the image in binary planes of representation. In the terms set out by <italic>Push/Pull</italic>, the punch cards and the loom (much like the software and the hardware of the sculpture) provide the material conditions that determine the resultant pattern of the textile. Like the pattern of lights, the textile is not a representation of a value (presence/absence) but a manifestation of a materiality whose contingency is continuous throughout the operation and that thus continually renegotiates that very representation: an interstitial site that is usually stripped away in the move from code to representation.</p>
         <p>What is important in both cases is that these various planes of representation (the punch card, the textile, the data from the sensors, the LEDs) are all intimately linked and, as we have already seen in the discussion of embodiment, generate a transformative encounter that is process based rather than object focused. Tenhaaf’s description of <italic>Push/Pull</italic> as context dependent and emergent is striking in its similarity to Plant’s theory of “connectivity” and of the “continuity” between subject, skill, and artifact in the act of weaving (Plant 2000, 332). In emphasizing the critical promise of process-based encounters, Plant also touches on a challenge to object-centered practices that resonates with the dematerialization of the art object in conceptual practices of the twentieth century (Lippard 1997). Themes of reciprocity, process, and embodied knowledges are all reclaimed in the interstitial space of contingency that is given expression in these examples.</p>
         <p>Although Plant’s work on gender and technology in the late 1990s has been widely critiqued in terms of its utopian and essentializing modes, the historical connections it makes between computers, gender, and weaving are worth revisiting, if only to serve as a foil that highlights the limitations associated with existing theories of binary.<sup>12</sup> In the context of this article, this is perhaps most productively demonstrated in relation to Plant’s reading of the binary digits (bits) 1 and 0. Plant establishes equivalence between the vagina and the 0 of binary by deploying passages from Irigaray’s <italic>This Sex Which Is Not One</italic>: “For if ‘she’ says something, it is not, it is already no longer, identical with what she means. What she says is never identical with anything, moreover; rather, it is contiguous. <italic>It touches (upon)</italic>. And when it strays too far from that proximity, she stops and starts over at ‘zero’: her body-sex” (Irigaray 1985, 21). If the vagina is the lack, then this nothing, or 0, that represents the entrance to the womb (a matrixial space, in Plant’s terms) might be positioned against the phallus, or 1. Plant writes, “they [1 and 0] made a lovely couple when it came to sex. Man and woman: one and zero looked just right, made for each other: 1, the definite, upright line; and 0, the diagram of nothing at all: penis and vagina, thing and hole” (1997, 34). Plant’s claim here is not simply that biological sex or gender difference is inherently structured like, or even through, binary code but, further, that the iconic relationship between the signifier and the signified reveals an ideology structured around the phallus/lack model of castration anxiety. If 0 is “woman,” as Plant suggests, then she becomes like the indefinable black box of the computer, the general-purpose machine whose ontology is always theorized as relational, instrumental, other to the subject.<sup>13</sup> This ontology of simulation would appear to speak alongside those critiques of the digital as a device for detaching representation from ground, subject from image. “Digitization,” she writes, “sets zero (vagina) free to stand for nothing and make everything work” (Plant 2000, 333). Although Plant has succeeded in exposing the mechanisms by which the feminine has been associated with one of the most pernicious ideologies of the digital, she asserts that this fluidity of identity is no longer a matter of “deprivation and disadvantage” but “a positive advantage in a feminized future for which identity is nothing more than a liability” (331). Such dissolution of identity has been critiqued for its inability to offer a ground from which a subject position might be articulated (see Chatterjee 2002) and, for reasons that will become apparent, doesn’t quite seem to square with the call—originating with Haraway—to upturn the rigidity and rationality of Western binaries. Plant’s attempt to somehow reclaim or recast the problematic rhetorics of digital ontology that were prevalent in the 1990s speaks to the ideals with which the digital was invested and that subsequent work, such as Tenhaaf’s, must resist.</p>
         <p>These tenacious ideals are, of course, founded on the Boolean logic of Western epistemology.<sup>14</sup> That the world is not only structured like a language but structured through language means that, beyond the simple iconic mapping of the written digits 1 and 0 onto biological sex, the relationship between binary code and Western binaries is perhaps most acutely felt in the realm of representation. As a displacement of the flow of analog signals, the discrete packets or pulses of binary represent a supposedly universal mode of information transfer that can successfully convey information across a range of material substrates without loss or change. The way that binary code appears to operate thus in fact establishes one of the primary instances of Western binaries that the discourses of feminism and science and technology studies (including this very article) have hoped to undo: the binary between information and materiality (and the correlative binaries of transcendence/immanence and presence/absence). Hayles’s work has been important for my own emphasis on representation, as she both connected the splitting of information from materiality to the cogito—thought is like information, and it can therefore be extracted from the physical instantiation of the human body—and suggested that this represented an “ultimate Platonic Form” (1999, 12–13). Likewise, other scholars have connected the apparent one-to-one mapping of the information image to the window-onto-the-world model of Renaissance perspectivalism (Veltman 1996; Cubitt 1998) and even shown how the notion of the digital has informed the genotype-phenotype model of genetics through its association with presence/absence (Chun 2011). Furthermore, developing the argument originally made by Hayles, Chun has worked to reinforce the idea of the digital as fundamentally material, not only in terms of reclaiming the substrate through which it must always flow but by arguing that the digital has actually “proliferated, not erased, media types … the ‘ground’ of binary” (139). The blanket reliance on digital rather than analog technologies in North America and Western Europe has actually given rise to new material form(at)s. For Chun, the fact that analog technology came to be seen as bearing some sort of indexical (or analogous) relationship to the phenomena it represented not only suggested that the digital was detached from these phenomena but also forced the digital into an uneasy—and historically untenable—binary with the analog (139).</p>
         <p>While critiques of Western binaries have been absolutely fundamental to feminism’s ability to stake a claim within science and technology studies, I feel uneasy about the effort to attach the history of Western binary thought to the binary of information technology. Computers may operate using a binary system of representation, but to analogize 0 and 1 as equivalent to female and male raises more questions than it answers. In other words, I’m not sure that Plant’s analogy between the vagina and the bit 0 holds true. After all, wasn’t the hole in the punch card of the Jacquard loom the on mode, the thing rather than the no-thing? The punched hole that is formally similar to 0 can thus be seen, in fact, as an early representation of the symbolic values we now ascribe to 1. Plant’s suggestion that zero stands in for the ideological representation of woman as lack in a phallic economy is thus contradicted by my claim that 0 is perhaps more like the thing than the no-thing.<sup>15</sup> However, there is an urgent need to move beyond the symbolic value of binary altogether, and so a project of simply reattributing values is not my aim here. Rather, I want to argue for a way of rethinking these digits outside of this framework, outside of the supposed irrationality of the nonvalue of zero, historically tied to the feminine and to non-Western mathematical systems because it appeared to be perfectly opposed to the rational system of Western mathematics expressed in the concept of the number one.</p>
         <p>I therefore argue that 0 became the opposition to 1 in binary not because it is a numeric value that, like the female body and the computer, is impossible to define because it is not really a number but only a plan for a number (a black box, if you will). Rather, 0 was adopted as a counterpoint to 1 in binary because it best represents the gaps between the punched holes in the Jacquard loom. The primary mathematical function of zero is not as a numeric value (nothing) but as a way of separating digits in positional systems, enabling one to differentiate between decimal columns. It is at this point that we may want to think about the written figure 0, used in positional systems of notation, in distinction to the numeric value zero. A clear example is that the figure 1 holds a different value when it is followed by a string of 0s (e.g., 1, 100, 1,000). It does this not because of the numeric value of zero but because of the way in which it moves 1 into a different decimal column: 0 acts on a number to escalate the scale of that number (see Kaplan 1999). To clarify, I am here making a distinction between two functions of zero. First, zero is a numeric value and, as such, has a conceptual reach that has extended outside numeracy. Because it has no value and is irrational, this zero has circulated in the realm of ideology and is the kind that Plant, via Irigaray, mobilizes in her literal and reductive interpretation of binary code and its zero function. The second, as I have just mentioned, is of 0 as a positional device, a written digit that is meaningless in terms of numerical conventions of signification: 0 is both spatial and temporal. What I mean by this is that 0 has a positional rather than numerical function in binary. Whether electronic pulses or written digits, the bit 0 dilates and distributes 1 across a field of representation that is necessarily spatiotemporal: every 1 is not equivalent to every other 1 but contains different meanings depending on where in the sequence it occurs. As a positional notation, a function that is made explicit in the materiality of the punched paper cards of the loom, the binomial system is always already inseparable from its context. Thus, it becomes increasingly difficult to think of binary in the terms set out in the introduction to this article: as an all-or-nothing form of representation no longer attached to the material and political terrain of the real.</p>
         <p>The bit values 1 and 0 thus do not have such a straightforward equivalence in male/female, East/West, or day/night, although this is not to say that technologies aren’t gendered in complex ways. Certainly, computer technologies in particular have been both theorized as masculine and dominated by an overwhelmingly male usership. But by looking at the 1s and 0s as material digits rather than as numeric values, we see that they serve a somewhat different purpose and that they cannot so readily be opposed to one another. In binary, therefore, we should not read 0 as nothing, as the numeric value zero, as a lack. Rather we should view 0 as a figure that spaces out and separates 1 across a field of representation. Thus, in reading 0 as distinct from the number zero, the perceived link with a fundamentally female ontology is made a little more unstable.</p>
         <p>In tracing the historically spatial function of the written digit zero, that precursor to the bit value 0, we are reminded of what still connects those machines that relied on punch card programs and modern-day computing: what is important in binary is not the digits themselves but the places where they occur. Like the punch cards of the Jacquard loom, the 1s and 0s fill a field of representation, and it is their position within that field that gives them meaning. The loom is an extremely useful example for developing this concept of positionality since, if each punched hole in the card were simply like every other, the resultant pattern in the cloth it wove would reveal a direct one-to-one relation between punched card and cloth: information mapped as image. Instead the patterns of the fabric, such as jacquard and damask, are complex and dense, with long sections of repetition, and, in the case of matelassé, the fabric has substantial physical depth. The fabric is not merely a mirror of the punched card; while it does bear a relationship to it, that relationship is structured through the material contingency of the mechanical apparatus.</p>
         <p>At this point, we are returned to Tenhaaf’s sculptural work <italic>Push/Pull</italic>. As with the loom and, as I hope to have demonstrated, binary code more generally, the traditional metaphorics of a one-to-one mapping, which have been aligned with theories of the simulacrum, can perhaps now be displaced, or at least destabilized. Through the notion of contingency as mediator, <italic>Push/Pull</italic> makes available to us a new system of metaphorics in which digital representation includes a negotiation with material conditions. Although there remain core differences between the loom and <italic>Push/Pull</italic>—the former ultimately turns code into pattern while the latter represents the interstitial moment between the subject and representation, making manifest the element of contingency—there are compelling similarities. In each of these cases, pattern (the in-formation image) is what enables us not to detect presence but to detect contingency directly related to presence. Like the prosody of speech, the pattern of cloth and the pattern of LEDs is a way to get at the contextual specificity of embodiment. By looking closely at the digital, we can imagine a way in which the bit values 1 and 0 cannot be so readily positioned within the agenda set by the binary structure of Western epistemology, even if they formally and functionally appear to emulate them. Reading bit values outside this framework is useful as it sidesteps a tautological collapse in the discourse of digital representation in which 1 and 0 can only ever be read in the context of themselves—a repetitive proliferation of interchangeable signs—which seems to me to offer little space for new practices or theories to operate beyond the self-limiting recourse to the real/virtual binary. The game is already lost if we begin with the premise that the digital always already invokes pernicious ideologies. What space is there, then, for new forms of representation?</p>
         <p>This clearly has serious implications for feminism, science and technology studies, and feminist art practice. Without wanting to simply ignore the tenacity with which 1 and 0 have been yoked to problematic ideological values, I do want to try and shift discussions of the digital. If we can displace the overwhelming metaphorical association of binary code with Western binaries, we might create a discursive space in which current practice and theory will not need to continually negotiate this treacherous tautology. This, I stress, is not to neutralize digital spaces so that they can be populated by that enduring and utopian figure of the cyberfeminist, nor is it to reclaim them as fundamentally gendered in some way, as per Plant’s important work in the late 1990s. But it does mean that, from within the cracks that have begun to form in its ideological armor, we can start to ask a new set of questions of the digital that encompasses themes of contingency, space, time, and materiality. Tenhaaf’s work, I argue, signals the emergence of a new set of questions in recent art practice. Many artists, including Tenhaaf, are no longer simply working with technology but are working in the space between technologies, by which I mean digital, mechanical, and electronic devices as well as, among other things, technologies of representation and of gender. In so doing, they are giving visibility to our continual negotiation with the contingencies of culture, capital, and technology in the spaces of digital representation.</p>
