<plain_text><page sequence="1">Are japanese Attitudes Toward Whaling America-Bashing? A Response to Tanno and Hamazaki JENNIFER BAILEY and BRAD McKAY e read with great interest the article "Is American Opposition to Whaling e Anti-Japanese?" by Dai Tanno and Toshihide Hamazaki in the summer 2000 issue of Asian Affairs: An American Review. This question is well worth investigating. The charge is one the Japanese have made for a very long time, and it is fitting that it be subjected to empirical analysis. We know of no other study of whaling that specifically targets this issue. However, the Tanno and Hamazaki article troubles us. First, the description of the problem at the outset is misleading. Second, the formulation of the study itself raises questions. Third, the conclusions drawn include some extreme statements not supported by the evidence presented. In sum, instead of throwing light on this question, the study further obscures it. First, the suggestion that antiwhaling nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have targeted Japanese whaling but not Norwegian whaling (Tanno and Hamaza- ki 2000, 82) is simply wrong. Antiwhaling NGOs have targeted Norway and many different countries over time; there is room here to mention only a few. The antiwhaling campaign was Greenpeace's second campaign ever; it was launched against Soviet whaling vessels from 1975 to 1977. The Greenpeace vessel Rain- bow Warrior first saw action against Icelandic whaling vessels in 1978, and Sea Shepherd sank two Icelandic whaling vessels at their dock in 1986 (Day 1987,133-34).1 When Norway decided to resume commercial whaling in 1993, it was denounced in most graphic language in full-page advertisements in major 148</page><page sequence="2">Are Japanese Attitudes Toward Whaling America-Bashing ? 149 U.S. newspapers. The ad campaign was paid for by the Humane Society of the United States and other NGOs. Those same groups also called for a consumer boycott against Norway in 1993 and earlier against Iceland. The fear of that con- sumer boycott was a major factor in the Icelandic decision to halt scientific whal- ing. After 1993, both Paul Watson and Sea Shepherd on the one hand, and Green- peace on the other, targeted Norwegian vessels and the Norwegian hunt (Watson's group sank two Norwegian whaling vessels). NGOs not only investigated Japan to see whether the meat of other, more endangered whale species is to be found there (the answer has been yes); but they also accused the Norwegians of smug- gling illegal shipments of whale meat and products out of Norway. Attempted smuggling by Norwegians has been the subject of resolutions by the Internation- al Whaling Commission (see resolutions 1996-5 and 1997-3). Many others would certainly dispute the remarkably narrow view that Japan has been singled out by antiwhaling NGO activists. Note that the northern native peoples-the Inuit of Alaska and Greenland-also view U.S. and European whal- ing policy as cultural imperialism, as do Norwegians (see publications by the High North Alliance: Blichfeldt 1994; Hallenstvedt and Blichfeldt 1995). The percep- tion on the part of many peoples of the "high north" that they are under siege, pre- cisely because of the persistent campaigns against whaling (and sealing, for that matter), led in 1997 to the establishment of the World Council of Whalers. For much the same reasons, Iceland, Norway, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland estab- lished the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO), which other political entities may join only if all standing members approve. In the same spir- it we will point out to the authors and those they cite that the "Japanese practice" of eating whale meat (Tanno and Hamazaki 2000, 82) is also an Inuit, Icelandic, and Norwegian practice-and may be more widespread in Norway than in Japan (Freeman 1995, 17; Greenpeace International 2000a). Having begun with this rather skewed description of the situation, Tanno and Hamazaki then ask what can account for it. Their stated goal is to explore the validity of the claim that "the anti-whaling movement in the United States is an expression of anti-Japan sentiment," which "the Japanese" have made for many years (Tanno and Hamazaki 2000, 82). Their approach to answering that ques- tion is to structure a study that examines the relationship between attitudes about whaling on the one hand and the nationality of the whalers on the other. Note that the built-in, implicit assumption of the study is that the Japanese whaling pro- gram is essentially similar to whaling conducted by others (here, the Icelanders, the Greenlanders, the Norwegians, and the Alaskan Inuit). In effect, this means first, that that the Japanese program is the same kind of whaling as that done by others. Second, the authors assume that the program itself is conducted in a fash- ion that is beyond reasonable reproach. If both those assumptions are true, then harsher opinions about Japanese whaling would indicate anti-Japanese bias and could not be attributed to the character of Japanese whaling itself.</page><page sequence="3">150 Asian Affairs But is Japanese whaling the same as that done by the other groups mentioned in the study? Tanno and Hamazaki briefly acknowledge that Norwegians conduct commercial whaling and the Japanese conduct scientific whaling. However, they then proceed to dismiss differences in these programs as a possible factor in dif- fering opinions, focusing instead on how many whales are taken. But differences in these programs may in fact be critical in understanding the view Americans have of them. According to official definitions used in the international body that regulates whaling, the International Whaling Commission (IWC), there are three types of whaling: aboriginal whaling (conducted by the American and Greenlandic Inuit groups, American Makah, and others), commercial whaling (which only Norway claims to be doing), and whaling under scientific permit (which Japan is doing, as allowed under the IWC convention). While the concept of aboriginal whaling is a notoriously difficult one, it is misleading to suggest even indirectly that there is no difference among the whaling of those groups or that such differences could account for different reactions on the part of Americans. Rightly or wrongly, many American NGOs that oppose whaling do believe the Japanese scientific program is simply a cover for commercial whaling, a contin- uation of previously documented Japanese attempts to evade international man- agement controls (Van Note 1979; Small 1971, chap. 3). This lack of trust of Japan with respect to scientific whaling may indeed have roots in anti-Japanese sentiment, but it is not clear that it does. There may be substantive reasons for this suspicion. The Japanese research whaling in question began in 1987, just after the moratorium on all commercial whaling took effect. Greenpeace reports that the institution that conducts the research, the Institute for Cetacean Research, was established by a grant of ten million dollars from the Japanese whaling indus- try and continues to be subsidized by the government (Greenpeace 2000b). The meat from whales taken for research is indeed sold in the marketplace, as NGOs report (although it would be odd and even wasteful if it were not, since the meat is not required for the research), at what is assumed to be a substantial profit. Since Japan cannot conduct commercial whaling because it withdrew its objec- tion to the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling, it is not unreasonable to sus- pect Japanese motives: indeed, it would be unusual if Japanese motives were not at least mixed. There are also legitimate questions as to the scientific validity of the Japan- ese research program. The Scientific Committee of the IWC has concluded that Japanese whaling is not needed for whaling management. In a series of resolu- tions (see IWC resolutions 1994-9, 1994-10, 1996-7, 1997-5, 1998-4, 1999-3) the IWC has asked Japan to reconsider issuing these special permits, and it is widely believed in the antiwhaling NGO community and elsewhere that ade- quate research can be done using nonlethal means (see IWC resolutions 1995- 8, 1995-9). This is in fact official U.S. policy, as illustrated most recently by</page><page sequence="4">Are Japanese Attitudes Toward Whaling America-Bashing? 151 departing U.S. Secretary of Commerce Mineta's op-ed in the Washington Post of 27 August 2000. We would point out to Tanno and Hamazaki that a good deal has been said about the Norwegian and Icelandic use of science, too. U.S. NGOs roundly con- demned Iceland's scientific whaling program, which began the year the morato- rium was to take effect (1986), and on much the same criteria as the long-run- ning condemnation of the Japanese research whaling (Stoett 1997, 80; Day 1987, 135). U.S. NGOs joined to file a court case in 1988 to try to force the U.S. Depart- ment of Commerce to "certify" Iceland because of its research program, a move that under U.S. law would have opened the door for U.S. economic sanctions against Iceland.2 The Norwegians have essentially provided the abundance esti- mates for the minke whale stock they target, and their science is routinely attacked as biased, even though the Scientific Committee generally regards the work favor- ably. Antiwhaling NGOs gleefully greeted news that the first stock abundance numbers produced by the Norwegians and at first accepted by the IWC Scientif- ic Committee were later withdrawn by Norway and disavowed by the committee because of errors in the calculations. Reasonable people may disagree on the scientific virtue of the Japanese research programs. Although the IWC resolutions find the Japanese research unnecessary for the management of whales, the IWC Scientific Committee has also found that there is some scientific merit to it. Being suspicious of the Japan- ese program is accordingly not necessarily evidence of bias against the Japanese. Moreover, what research programs requiring the death of the whale have anti- whaling NGOs ever found to be legitimate, necessary, and carried out for exclu- sively scientific reasons? We know of none. The Alaskan Inuit, Greenlanders, and others conduct aboriginal whaling. Here the numbers of whales taken are relatively small. This is small boat whaling done fairly close to shore and undertaken for what is officially recognized by the IWC to be cultural reasons. Attitudes toward these groups are sure to be influenced by a range of emotions, issues, and arguments having to do with the history of treat- ment of native peoples, the controversies associated with treaty rights, and the ambiguities surrounding the difference between whaling done for "cultural rea- sons" and whaling done "purely" for commercial profit. As Tanno and Hamazaki suggest, the most interesting comparison is that of the Norwegians with the Japanese. The Norwegians openly conduct commercial whaling and now take more minke whales per year than do the Japanese (quotas for the year 2000 were announced to be 655 for Norway and 440 for the Japan- ese). As noted, Norway can do this under international law because of the objec- tion it lodged to the commercial whaling moratorium, in accordance with the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. Most of the American antiwhaling NGO community opposes all commercial whaling, and there is a strong sense that killing whales for profit is evil. Both Norway and Japan sell</page><page sequence="5">152 Asian Affairs whale meat for profit. What then might account for different attitudes toward these two nationalities? Perhaps the answer lies in historical Japanese resistance to international man- agement and a persisting impression that the Japanese are deceitful about what they do. The Japanese were extremely reluctant, at best, to participate in whale control schemes in the interwar period; in the postwar period, Japan was extreme- ly slow to respond to scientific evidence that major stocks were declining (Small 1971). Some NGOs have documented (Van Note 1979) the efforts of Japanese whaling companies to circumvent IWC regulations, even before the infamous blanket moratorium on all commercial whaling. Their scientific whaling is per- ceived to be more of the same. And today, the Japanese are perceived to be the leaders of a very forceful campaign to remove the moratorium on all commercial whaling imposed via the IWC. They are accused of using economic aid to small Caribbean nations to secure their votes to lift the moratorium. (To be fair, anti- whaling NGOs are widely accused of purchasing votes in order to achieve the moratorium, and Norway has come under suspicion, although in a more vague and less specific fashion; see Andresen 1998, 439-40; Greenpeace International 2001; and HSUS 2001.) Norwegian whaling has a more mixed reputation. Norwegians pioneered the technology and techniques that revived the whaling industry before the turn of the last century. As one antiwhaling activist told one of the authors, "they have plenty of blood on their hands." On the other hand, the Norwegians became a force working for tighter regulation in the IWC after World War II. Norwegian domestic whaling regulation and attempts at international control actually pre- cede the formation of the IWC, and they were intimately involved with the failed interwar attempts at international management. Norway once unilaterally placed catch restrictions on its own fleet, leaving it at a disadvantage vis-a-vis other fleets that continued to operate without such restrictions (Small 1971, 151-52). Norway's recent problems with antiwhaling NGOs date to 1982. Norway voted against the IWC moratorium on all commercial whaling (which was adopt- ed in 1982 but was scheduled to take effect in 1986), arguing that such a blanket moratorium was unnecessary and not based on science. When Norway resumed commercial whaling in 1993, it was attacked by antiwhaling NGOs for doing so. Norway's position may be more ambiguous because it has based its decision on scientific evidence accepted by the Science Committee and because of its argu- ment that its decision strengthened the principle of sustainable development. Nor- way has otherwise a good reputation on environmental matters, which could serve to mitigate hostility somewhat: its former prime minister, Gro Harleem Brundt- land, in fact popularized the "sustainable development" phrase in the 1986 Brundtland Commission Report, Our Common Future. Having discussed the actions of NGOs, Tanno and Hamazaki seek to measure sentiment among the general American population. Although they are highly vis-</page><page sequence="6">Are Japanese Attitudes Toward Whaling America-Bashing? 153 ible, NGO activities are not a direct measure of popular opinion. To get a read- ing of popular American opinion, the authors rely on questionnaires. The ques- tions are based on an array of possible explanations of popular opinion from the literature and then formulating a set of questions from which four indexes are constructed (mass media, animal rights, whale anthropomorphism, and ethno- centrism). They then compare the impact each of these indexes has on attitudes toward each nationality. These indexes are, however, very limited in range, taken exclusively from the arguments of those who tend to favor whaling. There is no question, and hence no index, for example, that seeks to measure respondents' views on commercial- ism, greed, the integrity of whalers, or fears about sustainability. This means that there may be many variables the authors simply do not measure. The indexes that were constructed strike us as frequently weak or confusing. We are most skeptical about those questions from which Tanno and Hamazaki derive their "ethnocentrism" index, which is defined as believing that one's own attitudes against whaling are superior to the attitudes of whaling groups and that one tends to impose one's view of whaling on other groups. But the questions that are supposed to reveal ethnocentrism amount to asking the respondents whether they have opinions or a culture of any kind. Perhaps the single, innocu- ous statement that "we should educate people in whaling countries on the non- consumptive value of whales" is supposed to measure willingness to impose beliefs on others. This is very weak since the authors could have asked whether others should be forced to adopt their views, such as through the imposition of economic sanctions, a very real policy option under U.S. law. We are also curious as to why Tanno and Hamazaki think that the statement that "caring for whales is evolving as the norm among the nations of the world" is a measure of ethnocentrism. For better or for worse, the IWC has adopted a blanket moratorium on commercial whaling, much time and effort has gone into creating more humane methods of killing whales (the IWC has standards on this), and whale watching has spread worldwide (even in Japan). Given the voting pat- terns in the IWC, "caring about whales" construed in a more protectionist way is certainly multilateral and even extends beyond Anglo-American culture. But it is easy to interpret the meaning of the vague word "caring" broadly enough that those supporting sustainable harvesting of whales could endorse it. Either way, one can reasonably argue that this is an accurate description of what is happen- ing now, especially since the question uses the words "is evolving" rather than "has evolved." Tanno and Hamazaki asked respondents to react to the following statement, among others, in an attempt to create a "whale anthropomorphism" index: "Whales are uniquely special compared to other animals," "whales enrich our folklore," and "whales are marvelous." Those vague statements do not measure anthropomorphism, which is the attribution of human characteristics to nonhu-</page><page sequence="7">154 Asian Affairs man species. A better case can be made for "Whales can be called 'people of the sea'" as anthropomorphic, and the phrase "Whales are friendly" clearly does sug- gest anthropomorphism. Oddly, the authors do not ask about the intelligence of whales, whether whales have social relations, are monogamous, are good parents, go out of their way to protect each other, or have the ability to communicate com- plex messages by song-attributes that are usually cited when the topic of anthro- pomorphism is brought up. As for the variable "mass media," we do not grasp how asking people to try to remember what percentage of their information they obtained from newspa- pers, books, and television can translate into any conclusion at all about whether mass media influenced attitudes. This is not obviously a valid indicator of the concept it purports to measure. We note here that Tanno and Hamazaki assert that the U.S. media routinely treat whales as "special creatures" but fail to explain what this means. Since the meaning of this phrase is exceptionally unclear, believ- ing that whales are "special" need not confer upon those creatures some unusu- al status. Worse, Tanno and Hamazaki present no evidence for this assertion. How can this vague, unsubstantiated formulation translate reasonably into to a causal explanation or a coherent dependent variable? Tanno and Hamazaki estimated their variables using indexes rather than a more rigorous factor analytic approach. Even so, the reliability of the estimates is questionable because the reported Chonbach's alpha scores are weak (none were greater than .8, the usual standard). We suspect that factor analysis would have revealed evidence that the items did not produce a unidimensional estimate of the concepts. The question wording alone, as discussed earlier, introduces validity concerns. The weak reliability scores suggest multidimensionality, thus making the variables too unreliable to include in bivariate and multivariate analy- ses. In other words, the items appear to operationalize more than one concept. Therefore, all later analyses become questionable and any conclusions drawn could not be trusted. Finally, we object to the conclusions drawn. We fully agree that many Ameri- cans do not agree with whaling because they tend to value whales. This makes sense. We even agree-intuitively-that there is an ethnocentric bias here against killing whales, although we do not think that the study in question does much to substantiate this notion. Still this adds up to the point that Americans have an affection for whales and object to the killing of animals they regard as special. So far, prosaic, but okay. One would have to say that Americans oppose Japanese whaling for those reasons-yet those variables also explain much of what oppo- sition to whaling by other groups, according to Tanno and Hamazaki's table 2. But then Tanno and Hamazaki take a leap beyond their evidence, conclud- ing, "[I]t seems that Americans would not allow the Japanese to hunt whales under any circumstances. In a nutshell, even though Japan and the United States do not compete for whales as valued resources in international markets, Amer-</page><page sequence="8">Are Japanese Attitudes Toward Whaling America-Bashing? 155 icans still object to Japanese whaling"-clearly suggesting that it is Japanese participation that is the problem (Tanno and Hamazaki 2000, 87). The authors fail to consider a possible alternative explanation: An objection to thinking of whales as economic resources could account for some or much of this reaction. That is an alternative hypothesis for which they themselves have laid some groundwork. Tanno and Hamazaki base their statements on table 3 (Tanno and Hamazaki 2000) where they report that males and females object to Japanese whaling the most and support Alaskan Inuit whaling the most. However, they neglect to note that among women, there are fairly high levels of disapproval for the Icelanders, Norwegians, and Greenlanders as well. Disapproval of Japanese whaling is only slightly more objectionable. Even whaling by the Alaskan Inuit receives a nega- tive score. As for the males, the negative score for Japanese whaling is signifi- cantly lower than the comparable score for women, and it is lower than the female scores for 4 of the 5 groups. Still, the gaps between the scores for the Japanese on the one hand and the other nationalities on the other are interesting. But table 3 gives us only an aggregate score for the intensity of approval or disapproval by gender. We do not know the distribution of the responses, that is, how many people opposed or supported whaling and how strongly. Reporting the univariate frequencies would have been edifying, providing the reader with important information about how popular whales were with the respondents and how unpopular whaling was. Are the scores skewed by a few really negative answers that outweighed others that were positive or not so negative? There is undoubtedly a core group of people who would not support any whaling under any circumstances. How large a group is this? How many people over that core group particularly opposed Japanese whaling? Nowhere in the study do the authors supply this information. Without it, we cannot even pretend to general- ize to "Americans"-especially given the gender differences identified here. It is in addition wholly unwarranted for the authors to assume that Americans would oppose Japanese whaling under any circumstances. Their study is simply not designed to detect attitudes in changing circumstances. Previous studies about American attitudes toward whales vary in their findings. The Responsive Man- agement survey (1997) reported that 71 percent of Americans would favor a sus- tainable hunt of abundant minke whales for cultural and nutritional purposes. However, the 1993 Freeman and Kellert study found that less than one-third of Americans surveyed endorsed the idea of harvesting plentiful whales to obtain "useful" products (Kellert and Freeman 1995, cited in Kellert 1996, 118). Kellert's most recent study found that over 60 percent of Americans opposed "commercial whaling under any circumstances" (1999, 11). All the questions in the studies above are phrased differently, asking the respondent to evaluate whal- ing under various conditions. This at least suggests that views might shift if respondents are given additional information, an important point given the doc-</page><page sequence="9">156 Asian Affairs umented widespread ignorance on the part of Americans about specific whales and whaling (Responsive Management 1998; Freeman 1994). What of the respondents surveyed? Would the college students surveyed by Tanno and Hamazaki know about any of the points we have raised above? The authors suggest that Americans are on the whole fairly ignorant about whales (Tanno and Hamazaki 2000, 83) and they may well be right. However, these ques- tionnaires were filled out by students taking "biology-related courses." At least some of these students could conceivably fall into the category of the "attentive public" with greater than average knowledge about whaling. But let us suppose for the moment that the authors have tapped a group whol- ly innocent of direct knowledge of whaling. Would this therefore mean that the unexplained degree of difference in approval or disapproval stems simply from a gut-level dislike of the Japanese? Perhaps. But there is an alternative explanation: antiwhaling NGOs have criticized Japanese whaling for thirty years. Thus it is quite possible that while respondents might lack direct knowledge about whal- ing, they may well have absorbed a general and diffuse sense of disapproval from these long-term NGO campaigns. Nor is it necessarily true that these antiwhal- ing NGOs are full of Japan bashers: Given the history of Japanese whaling, the nature of the current Japanese research whaling program, and the manner and spirit with which Japan has defended whaling, it could be reasonably argued that disapproval of specifically Japanese whaling is ultimately rooted in Japanese behavior. Moreover, rightly or wrongly, Japan has a poor reputation on interna- tional environmental issues (so, by the way, does the United States) and is fre- quently one of the villains on environmental issues, ranging from the driftnets that supposedly killed marine mammals in the North Pacific (and were designed to target salmon from North America) to the destruction of tropical rain forests. Those factors can easily account for a diffuse sense of disapproval of Japanese whaling even in the absence of specific knowledge. Is American opposition to whaling anti-Japanese? Maybe. As the authors say, we cannot dismiss it. But what, exactly, is Japan bashing? The authors do not define it, but we gather it to be a dislike of what the Japanese do specifically because it is the Japanese that are doing it. Whatever it is, the term "Japan bash- ing" surely should mean something more than just disagreeing with the Japan- ese. If the whaling issue is any guide, however, legitimate disagreement will be very difficult to distinguish from opposition motivated at its roots in purely anti- Japanese sentiment. And what about the other countries of the anti-commercial whaling bloc of the IWC? Do the Japanese also see Japan bashing in their views and in the actions of NGOs with roots in those countries? We don't know. Tanno and Hamazaki have asked a good question, but the way they have presented the problem, designed their study (excluding any really competitive alternative hypotheses), and ana- lyzed their data leaves us no closer to answering it. Indeed, it indirectly poses a</page><page sequence="10">Are Japanese Attitudes Toward Whaling America-Bashing? 157 new question: Is the "Japanese" interpretation of the antiwhaling campaign as motivated by Japan bashing itself an example of America bashing? As Tanno and Hamazaki state (in a more restrained moment), "better-designed studies are necessary before our findings could be generalized to the entire U.S. population" (Tanno and Hamazaki 2000, 87). Now that is a conclusion we can support without reservation. NOTES 1. Day (1987) chronicles the antiwhaling activist war against whaling, providing plenty of caustic comments on the Icelanders, Norwegians, Russians, Koreans, and Japanese. 2. See Greenpeace, U.S.A, et al. v. Moshacher et al., 719 F.Supp. 21 (D.D.C. 1989). The defend- ents challenged the decision of the Secretary of Commerce in 1988 not to "certify" the Republic of Iceland pursuant to the "Pelly Amendment" and also sought to have the court declare void the 1988 whaling agreement between the United States and Iceland because of the failure of the defendants to comply with requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act. Iceland has never been "certified" with respect to whaling, but Norway has been on four separate occasions. Japan has been certified under the Pelly Amendment three times with respect to whaling and once under the Packwood-Magnuson Act. Canada, Chile, the Republic of Korea, Peru, and the USSR have also been sanctioned under either the Pelly Amendment, the Packwood-Magnuson Act, or both (see DeSombre 2000, 208-13). A broad spectrum of antiwhaling NGOs have traditionally pressed for certification and sanctions in these and other cases. REFERENCES Andresen, S. 1998.
