(B) What is the point of a writing that cannot be read? According to Barthes, an illegible writing foregrounds its true—as opposed to its functional—purpose: by refusing to transmit meaning, it draws the reader’s attention to its material nature, rather than its instrumental one. Barthes’s observation occurs during an analysis of some paintings by André Masson, but Masson was only one of many artists working in the s who were experimenting with writing. A fascination with writing, and writing systems, was a recognized trend among painters of the s: in , in a discussion of artists such as Fautrier, Bissière, and Degottex, the art critic Michel Ragon alerted his readers to this ‘goût du signe dans l’art actuel’. Ragon thought this tendency proved Western painting was, once again, looking to the East for inspiration: in particular, to the calligraphy of the Far East. Forty years previously, the Modernist painters of the early twentieth century had been influenced by the art of China and Japan, but these post-war painters were more specifically focused on Chinese and Japanese writing systems, and thence more generally on the various modes of self-expression and exploration offered by the sign. But it was not only painters who had rediscovered writing—the physical and visible signifier, rather than the signified—in the immediate post-war period. at generation of writers, too, was experimenting with typography, mise en page, handwriting, and new alphabets. Quite oen, their endeavours crossed over into more ‘painterly’ territory, resulting in collaborations with visual artists. Indeed the s and s are characterized by a burst of cross-fertilization between the arts: writers and painters came together as never before on the page/canvas, united in their pursuit of what they saw as the authentic nature, as opposed to the pragmatic one, of the sign. Such a focus on the materiality of art and literature is strongly reminiscent of the Modernists of the early twentieth century: the Calligrammes of an Apollinaire, for instance, would fit into this s trend. Indeed there is a significant number of artists in this period who exhibit similar concerns and who might, collectively, be thought to constitute a second wave of Moder- nism. ey all started in the late s and were active throughout the s  Roland Barthes, ‘Sémiographie d’André Masson’ (), in id., L’Obvie et L’Obtus (Paris: Seuil, ), pp. – (p. ).  Michel Ragon,  ans d’art vivant (Paris: Fayard, ), p. .

I am currently working on a book-length study that makes a case for classifying these artists as second-generation Modernists. is article introduces my thesis and examines, in support of it, three ‘samples’ of illegible writing from the s. e three artists I shall examine are extremely different from each other. I start with the graphic signs of Henri Michaux, continue with the post-war paintings of André Masson, then turn to Christian Dotremont, a Belgian writer and creator of—among other things—an intentionally illegible script which he called ‘logogrammes’. By looking at three very dissimilar kinds of illegible writing, I hope to show how widespread, at the time in question, this concern with the physicality of writing was; how it oen, if not always, stemmed from an interest in Eastern calligraphy; and how the issue forms part of a more general return to the body as the authentic site of meaning in the art and literature of post-war Europe. Michaux (–) Henri Michaux travelled to Asia in the s, and, as is evident from Un bar- bare en Asie (), China was arguably his favourite of all the countries he visited then: he describes the Chinese language, for instance, as ‘une sorte de brise, de langue d’oiseaux. Langage si modéré et affectueux qu’on l’entendrait toute sa vie, sans s’énerver, même ne le comprenant pas.’ He was fascinated, too, by the writing: for nearly forty years thereaer he continued to think about the Chinese writing system and to study it in some detail, as is evident from a notebook dating from  containing records of his attempts to copy out and understand the origin of some simple Chinese characters.is in- terest was not untainted with a certain amount of Orientalism: that is, like Loti before him or Barthes aer him, Michaux was guilty of appropriating aspects of Far Eastern culture to serve his own artistic and intellectual purposes. Michaux’s Orientalist tendencies are particularly evident in his earlier writ- ings on Asia, which are mainly to be found in Un barbare en Asie. However, the relationship between Chinese calligraphy andMichaux’s graphic signs, the earliest of which were published in  in the volume entitled Mouvements, does not appear to be of the same, fundamentally opportunist kind.

In this article I shall deal only with the first of these volumes, as my thesis is based on a tendency of the s; but it is fair to say that in all of these books Michaux’s signs are not so much copies or adaptations of Chinese script as creations which self-consciously define themselves against Western script, distinctive figures which are neither pictograms nor letters. Mouvements was first published in Paris by Gallimard in  as part of the ‘Le Point du jour’ series, in an unpaginated quarto edition which shows the signs at their best, as they are reproduced in their original dimensions. An updated version of the poem that accompanied the signs was published as part of a larger collection of texts, Face aux verrous, in  and : the signs were not published again, however, until the  edition of Face aux verrous, in which they appear reunited with the poem and their postface.e structure and overall conception of Mouvements seem, at first sight, to owe much to Chinese models of writing: its layout is reminiscent of that of the ancient Chinese texte Book of Changes, and Michaux follows broadly the rules of Chinese and Japanese calligraphy when composing his signs. But more than any kind of homage to Chinese writing, the book represents, first and foremost, Michaux’s determinedly hostile stance vis-à-vis the Western alphabet, indeed vis-à-vis Western languages and writing in general. e only ‘text’ in Mouvements, a poem that appears aer several pages of signs, starts with a stanza outlining what the poet stands against. is, it turns out, is ‘stickiness’: Contre les alvéoles contre la colle contre la colle les uns les autres contre le doux les uns les autres e repetition of ‘contre’ is typical of the man who was once described as a ‘poète du refus’, but what is the ‘colle’, or what does it represent? In the ‘postface’ to Mouvements Michaux explains that what is sticky is verbal, con-  For a detailed account of this publishing history see Parish, Henri Michaux, pp. –.  ere are several crucial differences between the  edition of Mouvements and its re- production in the  edition of Face aux verrous (also issued by Gallimard), due no doubt to Michaux’s constant rewriting and updating of his work: for instance, the  version of the poem, quoted below in the main text, reads ‘Contre les alvéoles | contre la colle | la colle les uns les autres | le doux les uns les autres’, i.e. without the repetition of ‘contre’ in lines  and . I have preferred to quote from the  edition in this article.  e page layouts are roughly similar, and some of Michaux’s non-anthropomorphic characters resemble a rudimentary form of script which occurs in e Book of Changes.

A similar effect occurs in the last line, in the soundplay of ‘la sienne [. . .] sinon soi’. e signs’ material nature is emphasized as we are told that they are ‘dix mille façons d’être en équilibre dans ce monde mou- vant’: ten million signs for helping us to maintain our balance in this moving world while avoiding the trap of ‘la langue des autres’. But the balancing act must not be stationary; it should be forward-moving, for the signs are more like tools than letters, designed not so much to be copied as to be used for navigation—‘comme on pilote’—to operate a vessel, perhaps, or an instrument to further our individual futures. e commitment to movement and deve- lopment suggested by the verb ‘piloter’ is echoed in the signs’ preference for transitory, rather than complete, states (‘pour être fidèle à son “transitoire” ’): they are designed not so much to ‘conjugate’, that is to represent forms which are already standardized, but to help us rediscover our own languages, private languages to express the self ’s innermost experiences. Even a quick look at the signs inMouvements shows that they practise what the poem preaches. On a first viewing they appear much more humanoid (or at times insect-like) than scriptural, although of course the simplest Chinese  Henri Michaux, Œuvres complètes, ed. by Raymond Bellour and others,  vols (Paris: Gallimard, –),  (), .  Mouvements, unpaginated. </page> <page sequence="5">  Michaux, Masson, and Dotremont characters, being derived from pictures, can themselves bear a certain re- semblance to shapes from the real world. Indeed the only Chinese script that they might be likened to is the earliest form, Chuan-shu, but even here the resemblance ends when it becomes clear that Michaux’s signs, unlike any form of community-based writing, are all unique, unrepeatable, and riotously individual. ey are also extremely convincing as movements: that is, as the eye moves along the horizontal ‘lines’ created by the sequences of signs, an illusion of movement is undeniably created. It is not so much a horizontal as a vertical movement: they oen look like a series of small figures leaping into the air, sometimes disturbing the apparent order in which they have been placed, out of sheer, joyous desire to spread their limbs and explore the white space around them. e lines range from thick and sturdy to spindly and weaving: the signs do not just leap, but wobble, lean, stretch, almost fall over, regain their balance precariously. e one thing they never do is appear stationary. e overall effect is remarkable: Michaux has truly succeeded in capturing not so much positions but the movements which created them, the gestures which propelled them into being. If we were to attempt to categorize Michaux’s signs, we could follow Parish and make use of C. S. Peirce’s theory of signs. is is a complex system which ramifies into a large number of categories when fully developed, but which rests on a fundamental, famously ‘triadic’ relationship: ‘what the sign stands for is its object, what it stands to is the interpretant. [. . .] eliminate either the object or the interpretant and you annihilate the sign.’ Between the sign and its object, there are three possible kinds of relationship. If a sign is like its object, it is called an icon (‘most icons [. . .] are likenesses of their objects’); so a photograph may be considered as an icon of what it represents. If a sign has an actual, existential relationship with its object, for instance that of a weathervane to wind, then it is called an index. If a sign has a conventional relation to its object—a linguistic sign would fall into this category—it is called a symbol. What do the signs inMouvements stand for? It is not clear from their appear- ance. Some of them are insect-like or anthropomorphic, so may perhaps be classified as icons. But they also seem to fit the definition of an index, because at a very basic level they obviously reflect the gestures made by Michaux, the  Chuan-shu, which was in general use between the eighteenth and fieenth centuries , was the script closest to the basic pictogram.

I do not think that they can be symbols, because, although some sort of agreement might exist among the viewers of these signs about their meanings (for instance that they are hu- manoid or insect-like), it could not be an exhaustive meaning, given that each of the signs is completely individual. Indeed it is their uniqueness, an integral part of their raison d’être, which makes any kind of classification ultimately unsatisfactory. What they stand for is difficult to determine, as indeed is the third aspect of the triad: what is their relation to their interpretants? Peirce offers three kinds of relation of the sign to its interpretant: a sign of possibility (a rheme), a sign of actual existence (a dicent), or a sign of law (an argument). Michaux’s signs might be dicents, but equally rhemes or indeed arguments: here again I can see no way of narrowing the scope of interpretation, and indeed, if they are ‘Signes pour retrouver le don des langues’, they should be utilizable in all three ways. Michaux’s signs could be all of these, but none at the same time. e only fact about which we may be certain is that they stand for the movements, or gestures, which created them. Michaux’s interest in the gestural dimension of writing, the physical act which results in the sign, links the written word back to its source, the poet’s living body. e two stanzas in the poem devoted to gestures emphasize the importance of this origin: Gestes gestes de la vie ignorée de la vie de la vie impulsive et heureuse à se dilapider de la vie saccadée, spasmodique, érectile de la vie à la diable, de la vie n’importe comment Gestes du défi et de la riposte et de l’évasion hors des goulots d’étranglement Gestes de dépassement du dépassement surtout du dépassement (pré-gestes en soi, beaucoup plus grands que le geste, visible et pratique qui va suivre) Indeed Michaux not only takes us back to the gesture which created the sign, but to something anterior to it, the ‘pré-geste’. Parish defines the ‘pré-geste’ as ‘the state before the realisation of any notion of linguistic construct, before grammatical and syntactical constraints are learnt or imposed, even before the gesture’. In Saisir Michaux seems to be describing his desire for the ‘pré-geste’ when he explains that ‘[J]’aurais voulu dans un homme représenter  Mouvements, unpaginated (emphasis original).  Henri Michaux, p. . </page> <page sequence="7">  Michaux, Masson, and Dotremont le geste, partant de l’intérieur, le déclenchement, l’arrachement, l’irruption coléreuse de cette intense, subite, ardente concentration d’où va partir le coup, plutôt que le coup arrivé à destination.’ In other words, the ‘pré-geste’ is not only the pre-linguistic state, but also precedes the gesture: it is a raw desire for communication, experienced as internal, emotional movements which subsequently give rise to gestures. In  Michaux retrospectively described his figures in Mouvements as ‘des gestes, les gestes intérieurs, ceux pour lesquels nous n’avons pas de membres mais des envies de membres [. . .] C’étaient des mouvements’. e above description is startlingly similar to a completely different, but contemporary, writer’s description of another pre-linguistic, internal ‘move- ment’: Ce sont des mouvements indéfinissables, qui glissent très rapidement aux limites de notre conscience; ils sont à l’origine de nos gestes, de nos paroles, des sentiments que nous manifestons, que nous croyons éprouver et qu’il est possible de définir. is is a definition of what Sarraute named ‘tropismes’, the pre-verbal, pre- gestural movements which exist inside us and which give rise to our gestures, words, and feelings. Both Michaux and Sarraute go on to relate these in- ternal movements to the pre-linguistic state of young children (in-fans); both Michaux and Sarraute see these movements as constituting a vital link between the mind and body, as the gesture physically reproduces the mental emotion. Both Michaux and Sarraute are members of the pre-Derridean generation for whom writing needed to stay linked to the body that had produced it, so completely at odds with the ‘il n’y a pas de hors-texte’ theory which was to dominate French thinking in the following decade. In Sarraute this commitment to the body produces a poetic prose so experimental as to be, for some, illegible; in Michaux it produces an actually illegible writing which, by remaining within the context of an object still recognizable as a book, actively subverts and questions the nature of writing itself. Masson (–) André Masson is best known as a Surrealist painter, but in the s he began to experiment with calligraphic forms in his works, the results of which Roland Barthes dubbed his ‘sémiographie’.e painter himself writes that  Œuvres complètes, ,  (emphasis original).  ‘Signes’ (), in Œuvres complètes, , – (p. ).  Nathalie Sarraute, ‘Préface’, in L’Ère du soupçon (Paris: Gallimard, ), pp. – (p. ).  Later, in Par des traits, Michaux links his signs specifically to the emotions, describing them as ‘pas vraiment une langue, mais toute vivante, plutôt des “émotions en signes” ’ (Œuvres complètes, , ).  ‘Sémiographie d’André Masson’, p. . </page> <page sequence="8">    the influence of calligraphy and other ‘oriental’ techniques on his work was a direct consequence of the time he spent in the museums of Boston, the city in which he took refuge during the Second World War, although he also notes that his interest in Far Eastern painting had its origins in his early Surrealist period. At that time, however, it was not easy to pursue this interest: environ , [. . .] un jeune peintre vivant à Paris, ne pouvait que très lointaine- ment prendre contact avec la peinture au lavis d’Extrême-Orient. A défaut d’originaux [. . .] il pouvait consulter plusieurs ouvrages d’érudits allemands ou scandinaves aux reproductions assez nombreuses [. . .] C’était peu, et pas du tout ‘dans l’air’. In the s, by contrast, Chinese and Japanese painting and painting meth- ods were very much ‘in the air’: ‘les discours sur l’art se gonflent soudainement de références à la philosophie Zen et au lavis d’encre de la peinture Sung’. Both Dawn Ades and Françoise Will-Levaillant, like Masson himself, trace his interest in Chinese art and Zen back to the pre-war years, but it is in the post-war period that he starts to produce work in which the Asian influence flowers into the creation of illegible signs—signs which form part or whole of both his paintings and drawings. e literature on Masson’s Asian or semiographic period at times fails to distinguish between the different kinds of work which might fall under that very general rubric. First it is necessary to distinguish the works which use Chinese methods of painting—the famous ‘lavis d’encre’ which fascinated the majority of Western painters of Masson’s generation—from those which seem to aspire towards a kind of writing which might be Chinese or Japanese in inspiration. My study is interested in the latter group, which in turn can be divided, roughly speaking, into three categories. First there are the large canvases, such as the ‘Migrations’ series, in which small squiggle-like figures, not always in black, are set against a colourful background; then there are the full-size ‘idéogrammes’, usually in black and drawn in powerful brushstrokes, such as ‘Message de mai’ (), ‘Colère’ (), and ‘Évocation d’Antonin Artaud’ (). Finally, there are the black-on-white drawings and illustra- tions, which divide into at least two subcategories: the largely abstract-looking drawings (the frontispiece for Segalen’s Briques et Tuiles, half-pictogram, half-abstract sign, or ‘Acteurs chinois’ (), seemingly completely abstract were it not for the title’s invitation to figurative viewing); and the doodle-like illustrations, to be found for instance in Patrick Waldberg’s Une étoile de  Le Rebelle du surréalisme: écrits (Paris: Hermann, ), p. .  Françoise Will-Levaillant, ‘La Chine d’André Masson’, Revue de l’Art,  (), – (p. ).  Will-Levaillant, ‘La Chine d’André Masson’, p. ; Dawn Ades, André Masson, trans. by Jacques Tranier (Paris: Albin Michel, ), p. .  (Paris: Fata Morgana, ). </page> <page sequence="9">  Michaux, Masson, and Dotremont craie, some of which look more like writing than drawing, but also veer at times towards the decorative and ‘merely’ illustrative. Barthes’s ‘Sémiographie d’André Masson’ was written as part of a catalogue for a Masson exhibition which took place in Tours in . e paintings under discussion appear to belong to the second category described above, the full-sized ‘idéogrammes’. In other words, these are the paintings which most closely resemble writing. By the same token they are the most Chinese- looking, so perhaps also most vulnerable to charges of Orientalism: a problem which Barthes, in his essay, solves by evoking intertextuality (‘un espace culturel qui est ouvert, sans limites, sans cloisons, sans hiérarchies, où on retrouverait aussi bien le pastiche, le plagiat, voire le faux, en un mot toutes les formes de “copie” ’). By placing these paintings within a postmodern ethos that permits, or rather welcomes, all forms of copying and borrowing, mainly because they constitute a ‘pratique frappée de disgrâce par l’art dit bourgeois’, Barthes exonerates Masson of any Orientalist appropriation of Chinese art. It is not the object of my article to contest Barthes’s judgement on this aspect of Masson’s paintings, but for the purposes of my argument it is worth pointing out that what he ‘borrows’ most obviously from Chinese painting is technique rather than substance; a certain kind of brushstroke may denote ‘Chineseness’ to the Western viewer, but other aspects of the end re- sult, certainly in the case of these paintings, point in the opposite geographical direction. One of these aspects is that Masson’s figures always tend, if at times only faintly, towards the figurative. It is not in Barthes’s interest to admit this fea- ture of the work, because any tendency towards representation would bring Masson closer to the hated bourgeois realism that, in his view, dominates Western art; but asWill-Lévaillant has shown, even at his most abstractMas- son never entirely abandons his allegiance to the representational. ‘Évocation d’Antonin Artaud’ consists of bold, simple brushstrokes, which frame several more complicated shapes executed in thinner strokes, but it is also unques- tionably the figure of a man. ‘Colère’ is more abstract, but the emotion of the title is represented—mimicked—in its style: in the thickness of the strokes, the sharp angles, and the brutally curtailed lines. A gesture of emotion, it is perhaps the closest Masson comes to Michaux’s gestural ‘mouvements’. Because it traces a movement which represents anger, it has an actual, or existential, relationship with its object: an index, in Peirce’s terminology. By contrast, the  ‘Poursuite’, with its red figures on shades of cobalt and navy blue, can almost be read without question as a figurative piece: the three  (Paris: Au Pont des Arts, ).  ‘Sémiographie d’André Masson’, pp. –.  Ibid., p. .  ‘La Chine d’André Masson’, p. . </page> <page sequence="10">    main figures are recognizably humanoid and placed in positions of flight and pursuit across the centre of the canvas. However, upon closer examination, each of the figures might equally be seen as letters, and the less complicated swirls that surround them resemble Western cursive script. Even an obviously ‘calligraphic’ work such as ‘Message de mai’ has at least one level of meaning which is figurative. e character in the centre of the canvas, executed in black ink and bold brushstrokes, looks (to a Japanese- reading eye) like a series of hiragana characters fashionably deformed into quasi-illegibility; however, some of the daintier flourishes on the edges look more decorative than scriptural. e smaller sign, in the bottom right-hand corner of the canvas, resembles a fermata, or, conceivably, a marginal mark in proof correction. All of this is partially framed by an incomplete border, a line of leaf prints in brown paint on the pale green background: is this the figurative rendition of the ‘message de mai’ which is, perhaps, the meaning of the calligraphic sign in the centre? is work, in its use of two separate formal elements (as opposed to the ambivalent unity of the figurative-abstract which characterizes the other works described), seems to look ahead to the logo- grams of Christian Dotremont which I shall be analysing later in this article. In ‘Message demai’, however, both forms are illegible, and the writing-like one more frustratingly so because it looks as if it ought to be legible in some way. Like Michaux, Masson uses writing in his paintings to preserve a trace of the body, of its desire to create (‘si quelque chose est “communiqué” dans l’écriture [. . .] ce ne sont pas des comptes, une “raison” [. . .], mais un désir’).e body is the origin of writing, and this is its truth: ‘la vérité de l’écriture n’est ni dans ses messages, ni dans le système de transmission qu’elle constitue [. . .] mais dans la main qui appuie, trace et se conduit, c’est-à-dire dans le corps qui bat (qui jouit)’.e result must be illegible, because part of the purpose is to frustrate any attempt on the part of the viewer to ‘read’ it. is is a writing which exists not to be a medium, but to prove the existence of a body and its desiring. Will-Levaillant, discussing the ‘Migrations’ paintings of  and , writes that c’est seulement après , semble-t-il, que Masson aboutit à une forme d’écriture plastique entièrement originale [. . .] L’écriture abstraite trouve ici une fonction sym- bolique précise. Elle n’emprunte rien aux formes de la peinture chinoise, elle est une forme d’expression originale sans équivalent dans l’histoire des cultures.  is is a stylistic liberty taken by professional Japanese calligraphers, and is referred to as ‘breaking down’ (kuzusu) a character: the practice is noted by Alechinsky in ‘Duo avec Dotremont’, in Christian Dotremont: les développements de l’œil, ed. by Michel Draguet (Brussels: Université libre de Bruxelles, ), pp. – (p. ).  Barthes, ‘Sémiographie d’André Masson’, p. .  Ibid. (emphasis original).  ‘La Chine d’André Masson’, p. . </page> <page sequence="11">  Michaux, Masson, and Dotremont e figures in these paintings certainly cannot be accused of Orientalism, simply because they are too different from any Chinese characters: like little zigzags adorned with occasional dots or extra lines, more squiggle than sign, they seem to be floating en masse across a vast expanse of ever-changing colours. Will-Levaillant refers to Masson saying that these figures represent ‘les myriades d’hommes qui, au e siècle, ont connu des migrations moins saisonnières et plus brutales que celles des animaux’.is suggestion further complicates the status of the signs. Are the figures, some of which (at a push) might be said to resemble stick-men, representational? Or, given what Masson says, is it the overall effect that is supposed to be mimetic? Or is he using ‘represent’ in the more technical sense of a symbolic representation? It may also be the case that both these possibilities are true: that is, the can- vas contains both abstract and mimetic figures. e zigzags certainly change across the surface of the painting. ‘Migration IX’, for instance, has a cluster of figures in the bottom right-hand corner which might pass muster as ideo- grams; further up towards the centre of the canvas, however, they become simpler zigzags, usually with a head-like dot on the top. Some of these begin to break up and merge with each other as the upper le-hand corner ap- proaches; in the meantime, in the bottom le-hand corner, the zigzags are attached to each other in a horizontal line which makes them less individual and more pattern-like, especially as they are close to one of the borders of the canvas. Perhaps the differences in the signs are designed to cause these shis in ontological focus. Certainly the notion of uncertain identities would fit in with an overall theme of emigration and its effects on individuals in the twentieth century, if the viewer were attempting to superimpose such a narrative on the painting. e third category I have distinguished, that of the black-on-white draw- ings, also contains figures which oscillate between the abstract and the figura- tive. Masson oen created illustrations or frontispieces for books destined both for adults and children. Will-Levaillant argues that Masson, for the frontispiece for Segalen’s Briques et Tuiles, invented un signe original: maçon tenant truelle, se construit la figure idéogrammatique, sil- houette et symbole à la fois. Dans le triangle (son outil) et la ‘clé de sol’ de son torse, je soupçonnerais volontiers une résonance musicale. Le signe, toujours, figure plus de choses qu’il n’en doit dire. To my less tutored eye, what she calls the silhouette looks much more like a series of gestures: that is, it is not entirely abstract, but describes amovement— an actual, emotional, or even perhaps syntactical movement. e triangle is a case in point, of course, of a sign which ‘figure plus de choses qu’il n’en doit  Ibid.  Ibid. </page> <page sequence="12">    dire’: it is all at once an abstract shape, a concrete shape, and a real object (a musical instrument, among other things). ‘Acteurs chinois’, on the other hand, appears at first sight to be a series of completely abstract signs: the dominant shapes resemble letters, but from Arabic rather than Chinese script, or at times even Roman script (the two central figures in the top third of the picture look like capital Ls or perhaps Zs). All of these figures are ‘filled’ with smaller squiggles, at times obviously decorative, at others resembling Western, cursive script dashed off by a practised hand. e title, however, invites the viewer to take a figurative stance: so, do the ‘acteurs chinois’ refer to ‘real’ Chinese actors? Or perhaps they are ‘actors’ solely in the context of the page/canvas, that is to say Chinese writing? But why then do they seem more Arabic in inspiration? It is possible, if one attempts a determinedly representational viewing, to discern two figures crossing swords at the very top of the picture; a bird in the upper le-hand corner; figures engaged in a conversation in the bottom le-hand corner, and so on. Like the doodle-like illustrations that Masson drew for Patrick Waldberg’s Une étoile de craie, these signs and figures are more suggestive of writing than drawing, but never cancel out the possibility of a figurative reading; in other cases, they seem to be signs of a merely—or purely—decorative impulse, the result of a desire to ‘fill in’ the emptiness of a space or a page. Masson’s graphic works keep the viewer in a state of uncertainty regarding the ontological status of the figures: is it a man, or is it a squiggle? Is it a sign or a decoration? us the natures of both writing and drawing are fore- grounded, and techniques which we associate with both (but which we see as characteristic of one or the other in different contexts), like brushstrokes, are questioned. Barthes acknowledges how Masson, unlike the structuralist and post-structuralist theorists among whom Barthes must have included himself, never saw fit to sever the link between writing and the body; whereas at the time he was writing, these very theorists who had all started their careers by divorcing writing from the body, by denying to those who live within lan- guage the experience of immediate contact with the real, were—certainly in the case of Barthes—negotiating something of a U-turn back to the body. So, when he was writing in , Barthes preferred to emphasize the similarities between Masson and the ‘théoriciens actuels du Texte’: in Barthes’s view, intertextuality, the importance of the body to writing, and Derrida’s argu- ments for the primacy of writing over speech are all already present in the work of Masson. But in my view, these characteristics, rather than establishing Masson as some kind of proto-language theorist of the canvas, place him in the same generation as Michaux and Dotremont: one whose playful refusal to decide between the figurative, the abstract, and the decorative foregrounds  ‘Sémiographie d’André Masson’, p. . </page> <page sequence="13">  Michaux, Masson, and Dotremont the material nature of the sign and refers back to the origin of all such traces, the artist’s body. Dotremont (–) Christian Dotremont was born thirty-three years aer Michaux, but died five years before his fellow Belgian. During his short life he was both a poet and an artist: associated with the Belgian Surrealists of his time, he was intro- duced to Eluard and Picasso in . In  he and Asger Jorn founded CoBrA (Copenhagen–Brussels–Amsterdam), an artistic movement dedicated to spontaneity and childlike freedom in art, transgressing the traditional borders between painting and poetry, and to a belief in art as a direct expres- sion of the artist’s being. Pierre Alechinsky, the painter and graphic artist, joined CoBrA because of Dotremont. Dotremont’s most enduring legacy is his ‘logogrammes’, writing-like forms which he began to create in . Mostly executed in black ink on white paper, resembling various kinds of script yet completely illegible, they seem to me to be the apotheosis of an illegible writing which foregrounds the materiality of writing itself. Yves Bonnefoy argues that ‘les surréalistes belges [. . .] étaient moins des visionnaires que des linguistes’ compared with their French counterparts. Dotremont was certainly always more interested in words than in Nadja-esque apparitions, and especially in their o-overlooked materiality. Alechinsky has suggested that one defining moment in Dotremont’s thinking came when ‘il s’était aperçu que par transparence, papier retourné mis à la verticale, ses cur- sives ressemblent à un ruissellement d’“écriture d’herbe” extrême-orientale’. Dotremont wrote about this experience in ‘Signification et sinification’ (): as the title suggests, he likens the result to a kind of ‘chinois’, but not in any literal sense. ‘Chinois’ here seems to have been shorthand for an unfamiliar script which foregrounds the materiality of writing for a Western reader. e essay goes on to suggest that pictorial elements can oen be more ‘legible’ than words: ‘je comprends mieux les pages d’écriture de Miró que beaucoup de ces journaux, de ces livres, de ces lettres que l’on me tend, [. . .] sous pré- texte qu’ils sont écrits dans ma langue’, and concludes that ‘la vraie poésie est celle où l’écriture a son mot à dire’. Dotremont’s theories of the nature  Yves Bonnefoy, ‘Préface’, inŒuvres poétiques complètes de Christian Dotremont, ed. by Michel Sicard (Paris: Mercure de France, ), pp. – (p. ).  Pierre Alechinsky, ‘Dotremont et l’exagération’, in Christian Dotremont, J’écris pour voir (texte et photos de Pierre Alechinsky) (Buchet: Chastel, ), pp. – (p. ). is book contains a selection of Dotremont’s logograms with a textual commentary and photographs by Alechinsky.  ‘Signification et sinification’, in Dotremont, Cobraland (Brussels: La Petite Pierre, ), pp. – (p. ).  Ibid., p. . </page> <page sequence="14">    of the signifier, on its material rather than aural manifestation, developed through the s: his thinking resembles and precedes Derrida’s critique of the phonocentricity of Western philosophies of language.Derrida’s essay on Aristotle’s prioritizing of sound over writing dates from , whereas  was the date of Dotremont’s artistic response to the same set of concerns: the year of the first ‘logogramme’. So what exactly is a ‘logogramme’? In Logbook, which contains a number of reproductions of these ‘logo- grammes’, Dotremont defines his creation thus: Les logogrammes sont des manuscrits de premier jet: le texte, non préétabli, est tracé avec une extrême spontanéité, sans souci des proportions, de la régularité ordinaires, les lettres s’agglomérant, se distendant, et donc sans souci de lisibilité; mais le texte est, après coup, retracé, sous le logogramme, en très petites lettres lisibles, calligraphiques (cette deuxième écriture est remplacée dans ce Logbook par de la typographie). So Dotremont’s logograms are made up of two components. Composed on paper or canvas, usually around  centimetres by  centimetres, the main component is a collection of brushstrokes which constitute a kind of writing: at times filling the whole space, at times centred, oen in black ink on white paper, but sometimes in colour. is is what Dotremont calls ‘le texte, non préétabli’, illegible and spontaneously formed. e second com- ponent is a ‘translation’, in French, usually at the bottom of the page. is text, which also serves as the title of the whole logogram, is handwritten in legible letters, hence ‘calligraphiques’. Characterizing the words written in the Roman alphabet as ‘calligraphic’ is an attempt by Dotremont to sever the other component—the logogram—from any link to the Western notion of calligraphy, that of the beautiful writing of scribes and copyists: he was always at pains to distance his creations from the merely beautiful. In this he is following Far Eastern views of writing: as Alechinsky argues repeatedly, Japanese or Chinese writing is not ‘calligraphy’ in the Western sense, not an attempt to reproduce models which have become accepted as exemplar- ily beautiful.is is also why Dotremont insists that the logogram is ‘non préétabli’. Another characteristic shared by Japanese or Chinese writing and logograms is that they must be ‘de premier jet’, never altered or retraced après  For a detailed discussion of Derrida’s theories of phonocentricity and grammatology in relation to Dotremont see Nathalie Aubert, ‘Christian Dotremont: “La Mathématique du ténu”’, in Christian Dotremont, ed. by Draguet, pp. – (p. ).  Logbook (Paris: Yves Rivière, ), unpaginated.  In what follows I have taken the liberty of Anglicizing ‘logogrammes’ as ‘logograms’, although, to the best of my knowledge, the English word has not previously been used with specific reference to Dotremont’s creations.  As it is extremely difficult to think of a precise appellation for the brushstroke component—a sign? writing? an illegible ideogram?—I shall, following Dotremont’s own practice as well as that of several other critics, refer to it as a logogram, although it is important to note that the logogram as a whole must also comprise the French translation.  ‘Dotremont et l’exagération’, p. . </page> <page sequence="15">  Michaux, Masson, and Dotremont coup: this is certainly a rule in Japanese calligraphy. And in China it was believed that ‘to a calligrapher, the single brushstroke offers limitless ways to bring his emotions to life’. For this reason, it was not advisable or desirable to hamper the conduit of these emotions by retouching or correcting: on the contrary, calligraphers were taught to cultivate in their writing ‘a unity of spirit, or movement, that binds together the strokes of a single character, the characters to each other, column to column, and the works as a whole’. Such a unifying rhythm represents, ideally, the self of the master calligrapher: Michaux and Dotremont would both have concurred wholeheartedly with such a philosophy. Dotremont had meticulous rules regarding his composition of logograms. In ‘Logstory’ he describes, in mainly humorous mode, the process whereby a logogram is created. Logogus, the artist, is suddenly seized by a ‘brusque envie de faire un logogramme brusquement’, whereupon he attempts to get to his room and his tools as swily as possible, while endeavouring to retain the mental and sensory state in which the ‘envie’ first appeared and to block out any extra thoughts from his mind. He describes the games he plays with himself as he tries to decide whether or not the logogram is authentically conceived, whether ‘l’esprit a eu un trop grand rôle’ in its creation. In fact the best logograms are those which do not result from a sudden desire, but which come from a kind of calm, semi-conscious state that he calls ‘sa préenvie présente’: il [Logogus] les a enlevés à une sorte d’absence de préenvie, c’est-a-dire à sa préenvie présente, à l’ensemble semblant dormeur en lui, du papier, du pinceau d’encre, de pen- sée, de tout, mais sans rêve prévoyant, et que n’a pas même éveillé — aux horlogeries de la fausse vie — sa brusque action. Sa brusque action, tohu-bohu de temps pêle-mêle dans un projection unique, où n’est pas possible de séparer départ et voyage, écriture et vision et cri, tohu-bohu pourtant silencieux, si loin jusqu’au début du débat. e term ‘préenvie’ is reminiscent of Michaux’s ‘pré-geste’ or Sarraute’s ‘tro- pisme’, and if it is the condition which gives rise to the action ‘logogram- matique’ that creates the logogram, it would appear to be comparable to those indefinable emotions inside Michaux’s artist/writer which give rise to the ex- ternal gestures that result in a mark on the page. Dotremont’s ‘préenvie’ seems to be less of a movement than a state, or a condition. e logogram appears out of his awareness of sheer potential, in himself, his surroundings, and his tools and materials: ‘l’ensemble semblant dormeur en lui, du papier, du pinceau d’encre, de pensée, de tout’. And it gives rise, in ideal circumstances, to a complete action which does not differentiate between ‘départ et voyage,  Long-Yien Chang and Miller,  Years of Chinese Calligraphy, p. .  Ibid., p. .  Logbook, unpaginated. </page> <page sequence="16">    écriture et vision et cri’: a single gesture which contains the desire, the idea, and the execution of the logogram. In the cases of both Dotremont and Michaux, the artist’s ultimate aim is for writing to capture his internal state, be it ‘préenvie’ or ‘pré-geste’; for this state to leave a trace on an external surface. How another person might view it is another question entirely. What might such a collection of brushstrokes look like to someone contemplating it in, for instance, a museum? Is it a picture or a sign? Nathalie Aubert asks a pertinent question: ‘faire sens, pour le trait, est-ce là affaire de mimésis ou de sémiosis, ou de l’un et de l’autre indissociablement?’. One answer might be that, as in the case of Masson’s squiggles, the meaning of a line depends on its context: if the context is neither clearly figurative nor abstract, the viewer is le to decide for herself. In the case of Dotremont’s logograms, the viewer’s first task is to make a decision about what the context might be: whether it is pictorial or scriptural, or indeed both. Dotremont makes this decision even harder because, unlike the works of Michaux and Masson that have been examined in this article, his logograms mix the illegible with the legible: that is, his logograms are complete only when accompanied by a text in French. e French texts are, crudely speaking, of a poetic nature, but in each case owe their tone to different kinds of poetry. Let us examine the following three instances: () —À bientôt, dit le début à la fin Et la fin ne répond rien : c’est un monologue () Je suis un logogramme né à Tervuren ou plutôt je nais à cet instant () Logogus fait un pâté. Gloria rigole. Chien dégouttant. Chatte de gouttière. Bêtes comme la nuit. Texts () and () are clearly self-reflexive, but the thoughts they express can also be mapped onto the logogram they ‘translate’, giving a spatially definable shape to the thought-process. (), for instance, is a somewhat cryptic remark, reminiscent of a Zen koan or a simple riddle; but if we are reading it as the caption-like text beneath the matching logogram, which is a series of fairly symmetrically positioned brushstrokes that cover the whole page, it is impos- sible not to try and make sense of the text by looking at the beginning and end of the logogram itself. Even that, of course, is problematic: is the beginning the top le-hand corner, and the end the opposite corner, as is traditionally the case on a printed page of Western script? Or should we be trying to ‘read’ the brushstrokes: in other words, are there strokes that correspond to ‘à bientôt’,  ‘Christian Dotremont’, p. .  Christian Dotremont, ed. by Draguet, p. .  Ibid, p. .  Dotremont, J’écris pour voir, p. . </page> <page sequence="17">  Michaux, Masson, and Dotremont ‘c’est un monologue’, and so on? Or is the entire sequence the monologue in question? Text () is even more obviously self-reflexive, and immediately asks the viewer whether the work of art is created when it materializes on a piece of paper, or when it is viewed. Is the Mona Lisa, if locked away in a bank vault hidden from view, a work of art? One answer to this ontological question is suggested by the logogram itself. is logogram consists of two parts: the le part, on close examination, seems to contain the Roman letters ‘cet’, as well as several other shapes which may be read as ‘t’s, and one sweeping figure which might be a capital ‘J’. But further attempts at ‘reading’ are frustrated, although the overall impression created by the strokes, that of an irrepressible movement towards the upper right-hand corner, may lead the viewer to think that the logogram is perhaps to be ‘read’—mimetically—as a gesture, or a breath (of life?); in other words, that it directly reproduces a movement which occurred in the body of the artist/writer. Perhaps what is being suggested is that such a movement, embodied as a mimetic sign on paper, nevertheless needs to be deciphered—and thence recreated—by the viewer to become a work of art. As for text (), at first sight it seems to betoken a return by Dotremont to his Surrealist roots: ‘Logogus fait un pâté. Gloria rigole. Chien dégouttant. Chatte de gouttière. Bêtes comme la nuit.’ It is, perhaps ironically in a logogram, a poem in which phonetics leads the way: the repetition of the voiced velar plosives (the ‘g’s in ‘Logogus’, ‘Gloria rigole’) closely followed by the voiced al- veolar plosives (‘d’s) and voiceless alveolar plosives (‘t’s) (‘dégouttant. Chatte de gouttière. Bêtes’) foregrounds the sounds at the expense of the meanings. Yet the letters are also repeated visually, so to speak, and the viewer is invited to look for these recurring letters—or something representing them—in the logogram, which is characterized by unusually thick, inert-looking brush- strokes. Again there is a mimetic effect of sorts, akin to synaesthesia: this time it is the sounds, it seems, which are being copied by the logogram, as well as the wet, sticky, dripping images conjured up by the words themselves (‘pâté’, ‘dégouttant’, ‘gouttière’). is brief ‘reading’ of the logograms and their accompanying French texts shows how the whole logogram involves the viewer in a process whereby s/he attempts to match the legible to the illegible, to understand both components by mapping them onto each other (not just explaining the logogram with reference to the text, but trying to explain the text with reference to the logo- gram). All our sense-making devices are harnessed in this attempt to read the illegible: mimesis, semiosis, representation, symbolism, and translation. e process of the viewer’s attempts to understand is perhaps designed to re-enact the process whereby the logogram was created: that is, if we ‘read’ it cor- </page> <page sequence="18">    rectly, we should be following the traces of the ‘brusque action’, the complete, mental, emotional, and gestural action which conceived of and created the logogram. In other words, the logogram is not a finished product, a completed picture or representation, but a process which invites the viewer to trace the very action which produced it. Although the adjective ‘illegible’ may be applied to the ‘writing’ of all three of these artists, the ways in which they defy reading are subtly different. Michaux’s signs in Mouvements are neither ideograms nor pictograms, al- though at times they resemble stick-men or insects. Peircean icons and in- dices, they would appear, in the final analysis, to be traces of the poet’s internal desires and external gestures. Masson’s illegible signs never stray completely from a figurative context, although this context must be understood in a wide sense, not just that of realist art. eir ambivalent meanings challenge the viewer at the most basic level of aesthetic appreciation, hovering over the figurative/abstract border in a manner reminiscent of the Wittgensteinian duck/rabbit: the viewer’s decision, in other words, must be cognitive as well as aesthetic. Dotremont’s logograms are perhaps the most self-consciously illegible of the three, because they always appear with a contrasting, ‘legible’ translation in French. Far more scriptural than painterly, certainly when com- pared with Masson and even Michaux, their illegibility is tantalizingly offered to the viewer, who must, in her attempt to ‘read’ it none the less, trace the trajectory travelled by the artist from gesture to sign. Comparing Michaux with Dotremont, Alechinsky wrote that ‘l’un peignait pour se libérer des mots, tandis que l’autre peignait pour les exalter’.e ‘translation’ component of Dotremont’s logograms certainly invite the viewer to ‘read’ them, whereas Michaux’s signs appear to be leaping in a wordless ecstasy of gesture and desire, albeit—in the case ofMouvements—always within the legible frame of the accompanying poem and postface. It appears that these artists, all active in the s, were working towards a re-evaluation of writing as an object, in a bid to link it back to its origins: their work betokens a fresh desire for authenticity, the ‘real’ or original. e desire to rehabilitate the body as the origin of literature can be seen in other writers of the period: Sarraute’s definition of tropisms, as we saw, shows sur- prising similarities with Michaux’s description of his ‘signs’. It is interesting to speculate on the reasons for this post-war desire for authentic origins that  Wittgenstein describes how human perception is never entirely free of thought by discussing a picture that can be seen both as a duck and as a rabbit, although never both at once: the decisive factor is the aspect under which we ‘see’ the picture, which is a function of thought. My analogous argument is that we can view a painting of Masson’s from either a figurative or an abstract aspect, although never both at the same time.

Anscombe (Oxford: Blackwell, ), pp. –.  ‘Duo avec Dotremont’, p. . </page> <page sequence="19">  Michaux, Masson, and Dotremont found expression, in the s, in these illegible writings, although there is no space in this article for a proper enquiry into the matter; the tendency is in marked contrast with the new movement of postmodernism which was to emerge soon aerwards, and which all three of the artists examined here would live to witness. Perhaps it was to do with having survived a particularly gruesome war; perhaps it was related to the diminished status of Europe in fa- vour of the United States, in both cultural and political contexts. Whatever the motives were, it seems logical to categorize these artists as Modernists, from both a temporal and a qualitative perspective: their activities immediately pre-date postmodernism, and the nature of their work—its preoccupation with materiality, its pursuit of authentic origins, and its willingness to sacri- fice intelligibility to integrity—is akin to that of pre-war Modernists such as Apollinaire and Delaunay. I would suggest, therefore, in guise of a conclusion, that Michaux, Masson, and Dotremont belong to a category of artist whose work constitutes the second wave of Modernism in the twentieth century. Many other writers and artists fit into this group: Michel Butor, Jean Degottex, the CoBrA writers, and artists including Asger Jorn and Pierre Alechinsky, as well as Cy Twombly. In spite of the advent of postmodernism in the late s and early s, with its preference for more ironic, playful, and socialized modes of creation, these second-generation Modernists continued to pursue their visceral, in- dividualistic notion of art, starting in the s or earlier, and concurrently thereaer with postmodern movements such as Pop Art, magical realism, and the ludic novel. Indeed, several of the names mentioned above, although sadly none of the three studied in this article, are still at work today: Ale- chinsky and Butor are still prolific, oen collaborating with younger artists such as Gérard Macé andMichel Sicard to produce fascinating creations com- bining graphic and literary art. Although they tend to receive less attention than their postmodern colleagues, perhaps because of the link to the earlier Modernists which wrongly suggests obsolescence to critics, they continue the traditions reignited by the second wave of Modernism to which the three artists examined in this article belong.
