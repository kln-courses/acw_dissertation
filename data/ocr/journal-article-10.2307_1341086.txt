<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT PUBLICATIONS THE WRONG SIDE OF THE TRACKS. By Charles M. Haar and Daniel Wm. Fessler. New York: Simon and Schuster. I986. PP. 335. $I8.95. Traditionally, Americans living on "the wrong side of the tracks" have sought equal access to basic services by mounting con- stitutional arguments in federal courts. Such a strategy has often required the plaintiffs to take the difficult route of proving racial discrimination. Professors Haar and Fessler argue that a far more effective remedy for municipal service discrimination would be the invocation in state courts of the common law tradition of a "duty to serve the public." The bulk of the book examines the development of this doctrine from its origins in the fifteenth century and suggests its potential relevance for modern litigation. RIGHTS, PERSONS, AND ORGANIZATIONS: A LEGAL THEORY FOR Bu- REAUCRATIC SOCIETY. By Meir Dan-Cohen. Berkeley: University of California Press. I986. Pp. Xi, 27I. $32.50. Through an elaborate fiction, our legal system has conventionally characterized corporations as "persons" and ascribed to them numerous rights. In this book, Professor Dan-Cohen fashions a comprehensive theory of organiza- tional rights that recognizes the social utility of bureaucratic organi- zations while rejecting their traditional anthropomorphic characteri- zation. Professor Dan-Cohen suggests that corporations could be more usefully conceived of as "intelligent machines" - impersonal, goal- oriented instrumentalities. He argues that this recharacterization would move the legal focus from the traditional private/public dis- tinction to the increasingly important individual/organization distinc- tion and thereby better equip the law to protect individual rights. GOVERNING THE HEARTH. By Michael Grossberg. Chapel Hill: Uni- versity of North Carolina Press. I985. Pp. Xiv, 4I7. $32.00. The author, an assistant professor of history at Case Western Reserve University, presents the first major historical study of American family law. Focusing primarily on the nineteenth century, Professor Gross- berg analyzes legal developments in such areas as common-law mar- riage and rights for illegitimate children. As judges seized the power to govern homes and became the public custodians of the family, they both influenced and were influenced by the social changes of nine- teenth-century America. The author concludes that this early judicial foray into family life simultaneously diminished male authority and increased the rights of women and children. It also solidified a num- ber of powerful principles - such as antiabortion and maternal biases in child custody - that remained in effect well into this century.

Professor Bell, a member of Georgetown University's sociol- ogy department, presents a textured analysis of the deliberational and decisional culture of federal agencies. Using as its model those agen- cies charged with administering subsidized housing policy, the book's concern is how and why these organizations fall short of the ideal of rational decisionmaking. Organizational forces, the question of ad- ministrative discretion, the impact and use of welfare economics, and the importance and problems of legal norms are identified as the central factors shaping the decisional process. The study makes com- prehensive suggestions for change in its descriptive account of the inner world of the federal agency culture. THE HISTORY OF THE NEW YORK COURT OF APPEALS, I847-1I932. By Francis Bergan. New York: Columbia University Press. I985. Pp. 342. $35.00. Since its creation in I846, the Court of Appeals of New York has been one of the most auspicious state courts, an articulate leader guiding the evolution of the common law on this side of the Atlantic. Francis Bergan, a former judge on the court, de- scribes in this book the conditions under which the court was created and traces its maturation from the nineteenth century through the first third of the twentieth century. The book is a valuable study both of the problems faced by this famous court as a functioning institution and of the solutions it has developed to meet the difficulties presented at each stage in its history. Also fascinating are Judge Bergan's bio- graphical sketches of the court's judges and his discussion of cases, many of current relevance, that illustrate the court's creativity in the face of new and complex legal and social problems.</page></plain_text>
