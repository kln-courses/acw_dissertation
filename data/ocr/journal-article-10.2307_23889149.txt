Politicians and policymak ers push for quick, "sound-bite" legislative responses to complex problems in education. Teachers and administrators, frustrated with the job of trying to educate these students in an era when schools are under intense scrutiny, sometimes resort to interventions that range from ineffective to legally and ethically unsound. The media tend to focus on the negative and sensational, not the success sto ries of these students. This article describes major challenges to advocates in three areas—legislative and judicial, educational, and media—and offers suggestions for effective advocacy in each area. I We are on the cusp of the 21st century, with all the promise and optimism that the onset of a new century brings. With regard to the field of emotional and behavioral disorders (E/BD), in many ways things have never been better. We have laws that guarantee our stu dents a free, appropriate public education and provide due process protections when disci plinary actions are warranted. We have an extensive research base delineating effective methods for prevention and management of the most challenging behaviors. More groups than ever before are advocating for high-qual ity and effective educational and social pro grams for students with E/BD. Yet despite the many good aspects of our field, all is not well. Sometimes it seems as if students with E/BD are under attack from all sides. In educa tion, schools too often fail to design and implement effective educational programs for students with E/BD (Whelan &amp; Simpson, 1996). Some school administrators attempt to discipline students with E/BD without adher ing to the procedural requirements of the Indi viduals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA; e.g., Balbi v. Ridgefield Pub. Schs., 2000; Richland Sch. Dist. v. Thomas P. By Linda P., 2000). Schools sometimes respond to demands for inclusion of students with E/BD from parents and other vocal advocates by eliminating separate placement options (Johns, Crowley, &amp; Guetzloe, 2002). Unfortunately, transfers of students with E/BD into general education are typically done with little or no formal preparation, planning, or support for general education teachers or the students with E/BD (Johns et al., 2002; Guetzloe, 1994). Too often, school personnel are not well informed about positive behavioral inter ventions and supports (U.S. Department of Education, 2000). Teachers and administrators who do not know how to use positive, preven tative tools to manage challenging behavior sometimes resort to more traditional and puni tive strategies, which are seldom effective with students with E/BD. Legislatively, the due process and free, appropriate public education mandates of IDEA are continually under attack from groups who would like to see local school district offi cials have more power to remove students with disabilities from school unilaterally with Behavioral Disorders, 28{ 1), 57-69 November 2002 / 57</page><page sequence="2">out provision of educational services. In addi tion, IDEA is seriously underfunded, leaving local education agencies (LEAs) to bear the cost of educating students with disabilities (Council for Exceptional Children, 2000). And sadly, our society has slowly begun to peel away the protections of childhood from juveniles who commit crimes and from youths who are accused of crimes or even just misbe havior. These children are labeled monsters or predators (e.g., Traub, 1996), their names and photos are made public (e.g., Browning, 2000), and there is a trend toward application of adult sanctions for juvenile crimes (Pitts, 2000). Not too many years ago, these types of practices would have been considered uncon scionable. Now they are quickly becoming the norm. Now more than ever, we must act on behalf of students with E/BD. Without a strong chorus of advocate voices, we risk losing years of hard-won gains in education and juvenile justice. The "politically correct" response to youth violence and antisocial behavior is pun ishment, zero tolerance for many types of behaviors, and placing the responsibility for controlling children on families. This trend is antithetical to the beliefs of most advocates for children and youths with E/BD, who believe in preventative treatment, individualized and positive educational interventions for misbe havior, and comprehensive supports for fami lies. Unfortunately, children and youths with E/BD have few groups who advocate on their behalf, and those advocates face tremendous obstacles, particularly when arguing for treat ment and services for students who commit violent crimes. To make the job of advocate even more difficult, ineffective policies such as mandated responses to so-called zero-toler ance offenses often become politically popu lar tools (Skiba, 2001). Such policies and practices are promulgated more because they give the appearance of doing something about discipline problems rather than because they have shown documented effectiveness. Unfor tunately, the desire for simple solutions to complex problems often trumps pursuit and endorsement of more effective long-term solu tions. Why Advocate? In 1999, various media sources carried a report about a 15-year-old student with emo tional disturbance who was banned from attending any public schools in Alabama because of his behavior (e.g., Olian, 2000; Roche, 1999). This student, diagnosed with extreme attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), had a long history of behavioral problems and was being served in special edu cation. From the time he entered kindergarten, he attacked teachers and peers, drew violent pictures, destroyed property, shouted obsceni ties at school personnel, yelled gibberish dur ing classes, and taunted the paraprofessionals assigned to work with him. Both the student's mother and school personnel tried all of the usual paths to help him—medications, alter native schools, counseling, psychologists, neu rologists, and even home schooling—but to no avail. The final straw occurred when the ninth grader attacked an aide on a crowded school bus and threatened to grab the steering wheel and cause a wreck. Because hitting a teacher is a felony offense in Alabama, criminal charges were filed. The judge's ruling in the case banned the student from attending any Alabama public school dim Sears, attorney for the student, personal communication, Octo ber 2001). The student subsequently was placed in a state school until he and his fami ly moved out of Alabama. Given this student's behavioral history, this case raises the question of whether he was denied access to public education for behav ior related to his disability. Because the records of the case are sealed due to the youngster's juvenile status, we were unable to determine whether a manifestation determina tion was done. However, it seems clear that the student had a documented history of simi lar violent, aggressive behavior, which sug gests that the behavior may well have been linked to his disability. This story and other similarly disturbing tales concerning the education and treatment of children and youths with E/BD illustrate why constant, well-organized, and collabora tive advocacy is essential. We believe that effective advocacy means vigilance on numer ous fronts and levels, a complex and multifac eted undertaking. Such a comprehensive approach to advocacy is daunting, but one that is necessary to help safeguard the best interests of children with E/BD. To more clear ly organize the many advocacy tasks we believe are important in the field of E/BD, we have conceptualized a framework that organ izes advocacy issues into three areas: legisla tive and judicial, educational, and mass 58 / November 2002 Behavioral Disorders, 28(1), 57-69</page><page sequence="3">media. There is, of course, a good deal of over lap across these areas, but focusing on them individually may clarify specific advocacy tasks and thereby improve advocacy efforts overall. This article delineates basic advocacy tasks that are manageable for busy special educators and parents but can be powerful mechanisms for change. In the following sec tions, we describe each of these areas and explain why watchfulness on all three fronts is important for children and youths with E/BD. Recommended steps to effective advocacy for each area are listed in Figure 1. All the areas of advocacy discussed in this article are interre lated and, to a certain extent, interdependent. Positive changes in one area, such as media treatment of children and youths, may affect positive changes in other areas, such as leg islative agendas. Three Areas of Advocacy Legislative and Judicial Advocacy With limited resources for many competing educational programs, there must be laws and funding to ensure that all children with dis abilities, including those accused of crimes, receive an appropriate education. Our history and case law tell us that without such provi sions these children are at risk of being excluded from public education. Despite this history, it is easy to be com placent. Current laws for the education of children and youths with F./BD are well estab lished and include protections regarding disci pline, due process, and the right to a free, appropriate public education. It is easy to be lulled into thinking that all is well, that there is little to do. Nothing could be further from the truth. Reauthorization of these and other relat ed laws provides opportunities for opponents to try to weaken protections for children and youths with E/BD or add provisions that pro vide loopholes for school district administra tors to avoid certain unpopular restrictions on discipline. For example, discussions concerning reauthorization of IDEA are currently in progress. To understand potential hurdles advocates will likely face during this process, it is instructive to review the 107th Congress's reauthorization of the Elementary and Sec ondary Education Act (ESEA), which President Bush signed into law in January 2002. Diligent efforts of advocates during reauthorization of ESEA helped deflect inclusion of provisions that would have amended IDEA discipline rules. These provisions would have required school districts to apply uniform discipline procedures to all students for certain zero-tol erance offenses or offenses addressed in state or local policies. Educational services for stu dents with disabilities would have been allowed only if such services were available to students without disabilities. During ESEA reauthorization, Representa tive Norwood (R-GA) proposed an amend ment that would have required districts to apply uniform discipline policies for any stu dent who committed certain offenses related to weapons, drugs, and assault. No manifesta tion determination would have been allowed, and no educational services would have been permitted for students with disabilities during expulsion unless those services were provided to students without disabilities. This would have meant that a student with E/BD who was caught with a pocket knife at school could have been expelled with no educational serv ices and with no consideration of whether the act was related to his or her disability. Another example of the dangers for stu dents with disabilities that lurked during ESEA reauthorization was in an amendment to ESEA proposed by Senator Sessions (R-AL). Among other things, this amendment would have modified the "stay-put" provision of IDEA to allow unilateral removal of students with dis abilities for assaulting or threatening to assault school personnel or for carrying or threatening to carry or use a weapon. Thus, a student who verbally threatened a teacher could have been removed to an alternative educational setting immediately and with no prior due process steps. Clearly, such a provision could signifi cantly interrupt the educational program of some students. Fortunately, despite strong bipartisan sup port, these proposed amendments were not included in the final version of ESEA. This achievement was largely because advocacy groups, including the Council for Children with Behavioral Disorders (CCBD) and the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), con vinced Congress to postpone the discipline debate until the reauthorization of IDEA. Given this compromise, we can expect these issues to be raised during IDEA reauthoriza tion. If these provisions ever find their way into Behavioral Disorders, 28(1), 57-69 November 2002 / 59</page><page sequence="4">law, it will be the first time since Public Law 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, was signed into law in 1975 that educational services for students with disabili ties could be legally terminated. It is critical that advocates not be lulled into thinking that small reductions in the power and protections of IDEA and other laws pertinent to children and youths with E/BD are of little consequence. Little erosions could easily lead to changes that render the original law, and the intent of the law, virtually unrec ognizable. For example, let's imagine that advocates concede to pressure to allow cessa tion of educational services for students who commit a violent act at school or who bring a weapon to school. It is not inconceivable to think that reducing this aspect of free, appro priate public education would set a precedent that could lead to cessation of services for other reasons (e.g, fighting at school, excessive absences, chronic pattern of misbehavior). We must not forget our relatively recent history, when states and districts used arbitrary criteria (e.g., "educabiiity") to determine which chil dren could receive educational services. Given our history of such practices, we must not allow even minor reductions in existing protections. Without our constant advocacy, we risk having existing laws modified to the point of being unrecognizable in terms of pro viding protections to troubled children and youths or undercut by clauses in other laws. Still another potential challenge for advo cates is lurking in the form of a document pub lished by the Fordham Foundation and the Progressive Policy Institute, Rethinking Special Education for a New Century (Finn, Rother ham, &amp; Hokanson, 2001). The Bush adminis tration is expected to rely heavily on this document during IDEA reauthorization, as witnessed by the fact that several contributors to the report served on the President's Com mission on Excellence in Special Education. The Commission was charged with gathering information about the state of special educa tion and concluding with a report that includes recommendations for policy and practice. That report was released in July 2002. The Fordham report and the recognition it was given by the administration raises con cerns among advocates for two reasons. First, the report perpetuates the myth of dual stan dards for general and special education, par ticularly with respect to discipline (e.g., Horn &amp; Tynan, 2001), despite evidence to the con trary. For example, a U.S. General Accounting Office (2001) report commissioned by Con gress stated that 87% of school principals who were surveyed for the report rated special edu cation discipline policies as having a positive or neutral effect on school safety and orderli ness and that special education students who are involved in serious misconduct are disci plined in a manner similar to that of general education students. Thus the evidence fails to support the assertion of a double discipline standard. A second reason for concern centers on the fact that some contributors to the Fordham report argue for streamlining the number of special education disability categories (e.g., Horn &amp; Tynan, 2001 ). In doing so, they appear to raise questions about the validity of certain IDEA disability categories, arguing that stu dents with neurologically based disorders (e.g., ADHD) and behavioral disorders would be more appropriately served by using preven tative and management strategies in general education. We applaud the emphasis on pre vention and the expectation that all teachers use high-quality preventative and manage ment strategies. However, Horn and Tynan went on to say that: [f]or those students who persist in defying rules despite such [school wide] interventions, it is questionable whether they should be included with in the framework of special education at all. It is a fine line between a psy chiatric disorder that can be treated and criminal behavior that should be adjudicated, and the distinction is even more difficult in the high school years, (p. 44) This statement is both troubling and con fusing. Our interpretation is that the authors are arguing that students who do not respond to school-wide management programs should not be provided with more individualized, school-based interventions. But it is not clear whether the authors then contend that stu dents "who persist in defying rules" should be afforded mental health treatment or adjudicat ed. Either way, it appears that Horn and Tynan have drawn a line to differentiate students who "belong" in school from those who do not. Of course, not all proposed legislation is negative for children and youths with E/BD. Sometimes advocates need to contact Congres 60 / November 2002 Behavioral Disorders, 28( 1), 57-69</page><page sequence="5">sional representatives to encourage passage of a bill that would help families and children with E/BD. One example of E/BD-friendly leg islation pending in the 107th Congress is the Family Opportunity Act (S. 321 and H.R. 600). The Family Opportunity Act would allow fami lies of children with disabilities to buy in to Medicaid to guarantee insurance coverage for these sometimes difficult-to-insure children. Even the Rethinking Special Education report proposed an alternative approach to identifying, assessing, and treating learning disabilities (Lyon et al., 2001). Lyon and his colleagues outline the types of major improve ments that are needed to better ensure that all students learn to read. Thus, advocates need to be alert not only to potentially harmful legisla tion, but helpful legislation as well. Closely related to the need for legislative advocacy is the need for vigilance in the area of judicial treatment of young people accused of crimes. Perhaps because of our society's push to get tough on crime and the popularity of zero-tolerance rules and laws, we are see ing children who commit serious crimes certi fied as adults at increasingly younger ages. These children are then tried in adult courts and given adult sentences (Pitts, 2000). The percentage of juvenile cases trans ferred to adult courts through judicial waiver (i.e., the case is transferred when the juvenile court judge waives jurisdiction), increased by 68% from 1988 to 1992 (Sickmund, 1994). While no national data exist on the number of juvenile cases tried in adult courts under pros ecutorial discretion (i.e., prosecutors in some states have discretion to file certain types of juvenile offenses in criminal court or juvenile court), some evidence suggests that prosecuto rial discretion transfers may outnumber judi cial waivers (Sickmund, 1994). Not long ago, Court TV aired the trial of a then-12-year-old Florida boy accused of manslaughter in the death of his 6-year-old cousin. The child died while being cared for by the accused boy. The death was apparently the result of the accused boy's applying wrestling holds he had seen displayed by wrestlers on television. This youngster was recently sen tenced to life in prison without parole (Brown ing, 2000). Such sentences fly in the face of a substantial body of research showing that minors who are incarcerated in adult prisons are at much greater risk of harm than their age peers housed in juvenile facilities. For exam ple, a report on juveniles housed in adult pris ons commissioned by the Bureau of Justice Assistance in the U.S. Department of Justice revealed that almost half the juveniles in adult prisons have been the victims of violence within the prison (Austin, Johnson, &amp; Gregori ou, 2000). The Juvenile Justice and Delinquen cy Prevention Act (JJDPA) of 1974 mandated sight and sound separation of juveniles and adults at all stages of the judicial process; however, the JJDPA does not apply to juveniles who are tried and sentenced as adults (Austin et al., 2000). We believe that the trend toward lowering the age at which children can be tried as adults is dangerous, and certainly at odds with the philosophy of treatment. We must make it clear to legislators, judges, and the public that offering treatment does not mean that the crime goes unpunished. It does, however, offer the possibility for salvaging one life. Recommended Advocacy Actions Fortunately, organizations such as CCBD and CEC, as well as technology such as electronic mail and the Internet, have made advocacy work much easier. It is not necessary for each of us to engage in the tedious process of track ing bills from their introduction, through com mittees, to the final version presented to the full House or Senate. Furthermore, groups can be powerful advocacy voices. Individuals from CCBD and CEC have worked long and hard to advocate for legislation that would benefit students with E/BD and their families and to oppose poten tially damaging legislation. For example, dur ing the last reauthorization of IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments, 1997), there were attempts in Congress to allow cessation of services to stu dents with disabilities in disciplinary situa tions. Countless hours of coordinated efforts among CEC, CCBD, and other divisions, as well as many other groups, not only prevented cessation of services, but helped craft the dis ciplinary provisions that, according to the dis cipline report from the U.S. General Accounting Office (2001), appear to be work ing well. So what should we as individuals do?

Continued Educational Advocacy While there are many areas that need advo cates' attention in education, we will address only inclusion, discipline, and the use of high-quality practices. During the early days of IDEA, the term mainstreaming was used to describe the concept and process of educat ing students with disabilities in general edu cation classes. This concept has evolved to inclusion, with greater emphasis on longer periods of time in general education with accompanying supports. While we support the concept of inclusion and the opportunities that inclusionary practices offer for students with E/BD, research suggests that inclusion— full inclusion in particular—is not always the most appropriate educational placement for students with E/BD (Kauffman, Lloyd, Baker, &amp; Riedel, 1995; MacMillan, Gresham, &amp; For ness, 1996). Due to a scarcity of resources, students are often placed in general education settings without the full array of supports they may need for success and without training for general or special education teachers in effec tive inclusionary practices for students with E/BD (Scruggs &amp; Mastropieri, 1996). When students with E/BD are placed in situations that lack the support needed to help them control their behavior, it is unlikely that their Behavioral Disorders, 280), 57-69 November 2002 / 63</page><page sequence="8">Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law: Advocacy information regarding mental health issues and laws. • www.bazelon.org Center for Effective Collaboration and Practice: Wide range of information on E/BD topics. • www.air-dc.org/cecp/guide/websites.htm Center for Law and Education: Law and policy information about a wide range of key edu cation programs, including IDEA. • www.cleweb.org Council for Children with Behavioral Disorders: Advocacy information of concern to advo cates for children and youths with E/BD. • www.CCBD.net Council for Exceptional Children: Public Policy and Legislative information section provides legislative updates and access to easy tools for contacting legislators. • www.cec.sped.org Federation of Families for Children's Mental Health: Wide range of information regarding children's mental health. • www.ffchmh.org Idea Practices: Comprehensive information about requirements and implementation of IDEA, plus much more. • www.ideapractices.org National Alliance for the Mentally III: Comprehensive site for information about mental ill ness in adults and children. • www.nami.org National Center on Education, Disability, and Juvenile Justice: Research, training, technical assistance, and dissemination program concerned with youths with disabilities in the juve nile justice system. • www.edjj.org Safe and Responsive Schools Project: Model demonstration and technical assistance project. • www.indiana.edu/~safeschl/index.html Thomas search engine, Library of Congress: Allows users to research current, pending, and past legislation. • www.thomas.loc.gov Wrightslaw: Comprehensive site for special education information and case law. • www.wrightslaw.com/ You may obtain a copy of the Fordham Foundation/Progressive Policy Institute's report, Rethinking Special Education for a New Century at www.fordhamfoundation.org.

Resources for Advocacy 64 / November 2002 Behavioral Disorders, 28( 1), 57-69</page><page sequence="9">disability will be managed effectively. One possible outcome under such circumstances is that these students will exhibit high levels of inappropriate behavior and low levels of socially and academically appropriate behav ior. Such behavior cannot be tolerated in general education environments, so adminis trators may seek to remove these students. Thus, paradoxically, inclusion could conceiv ably result in exclusion for students with E/BD. IDEA clearly calls for a continuum of alternative placements and individualized decision making. Inclusion of a student with E/BD is appropriate only when the student's individualized education program (IEP) team determines that an inclusion setting is the least restrictive environment for him or her, and only when supports needed to ensure attainment of academic, social, and behav ioral goals and objectives are provided. If local education agencies and individual schools use the argument of inclusion to reduce the range of instructional options available to students with E/BD, individual ized decision making about placement is compromised. Advocates must monitor dis trict practices to be sure that districts offer a full continuum of placement options and that individualized decision making is maintained. When eliminating a particular type of instruc tional arrangement would result in a group of students with disabilities being moved en masse from the existing placement to the new arrangement, we suggest that the mandate of individualized decision making is not being followed. Advocates must question such wholesale movement; they should actively argue for schools to maintain a full continuum of services and make placement decisions on a case-by-case basis. For students with E/BD, discipline is an ever-present concern. The IDEA protections of a free, appropriate public education and due process require certain practices and proce dures with regard to discipline. For example, IDEA requires that, for students whose behav ior interferes with their learning or the learn ing of others, school personnel must develop a behavior intervention plan (BIP) that is based on functional behavioral assessment. Yet some educators appear to be ill prepared to use positive, supportive, therapeutic tech niques for preventing and managing challeng ing behavior. Even a cursory examination of case law reveals that some administrators are apparent ly unaware of these protections or apply uni lateral disciplinary actions for school-based offenses (LIH ex. rel. LH v. New York City Bd. of Educ., 2000; Balbi v. Ridgefield Pub. Schs., 2000; Independent Sch. Dist. No. 279, 1999). Ironically, basic problems with discipline and teaching are occurring despite a considerable research base that clearly delineates effective, preventive practices. We must advocate against disciplinary practices that are contrary to the best interest of children and youths with E/BD. In their des peration to manage the ever more disturbing behaviors exhibited by these students, some LEAs resort to management approaches that at the least are ineffective and at the worst are egregious violations of children's rights under IDEA. One such program garnered attention as a result of a parent's lawsuit against the school (Clay "Dusty" A. V. Pflugerville ISD, 1995). This program, called Academic Compliance Training (ACT; Partin, 1995), is designed as an intervention for children who exhibit high lev els of misbehavior. According to the hearing officer's report, one component of the ACT program consists of students' being given large numbers of worksheets well below their skill level. Students must complete these work sheets before they can have lunch or go home in the afternoon. Teachers are instructed to try to distract students as they work on their assignments, using tactics such as yelling at them, playing ball in the classroom, or even jumping on the desk next to a student. If stu dents look away from their task during this time, they are given additional worksheets as punishment. Unfortunately, what we have described is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the ACT practices that were described in the hearing officer's report. Another highly punitive approach to disci pline used in a Las Vegas, Nevada, school was made public when the child's parents brought suit against school officials (Witte v. Clark County, 1999). In this case, school officials used a variety of so-called management strate gies in response to inappropriate behavior exhibited by a 10-year-old boy with Tourette syndrome, asthma, ADHD, and emotional problems. One such "management strategy" consisted of requiring the child to eat oatmeal mixed with his own vomit. These two instances of disciplinary interventions are occurring despite current laws. This leads us to Behavioral Disorders, 28{ 1), 57-69 November 2002 / 65</page><page sequence="10">wonder what will happen if these laws are ever weakened. Recommended Advocacy Actions Advocacy in education may be the area in which individuals in school settings can have the greatest impact. Of course, our first respon sibility as advocates is to stay well informed about best practices. Because so much infor mation about strategies and practices is avail able through workshops and conferences, word-of-mouth, the Internet, and even profes sional journals, such information should be screened through a filter of skepticism. Educa tor/advocates should examine the research supporting the instructional or management techniques they are considering. We urge adoption of practices that are backed by inde pendent, empirical evidence of effectiveness. Figure 1 describes strategies for advocacy in placement and discipline. These strategies are not meant to be an exhaustive list; we hope they will stimulate readers to identify other ways to act on behalf of students with E/BD. Perhaps one of the most important activ ities for advocates is to share success stories and knowledge of effective strategies with oth ers. People who advocate for harsher disci pline laws, for example, may not be well informed about the extent to which positive behavioral supports can serve as effective pre ventative interventions. Likewise, school per sonnel may be more likely to insist that educational programs for students with E/BD offer meaningful and effective instruction when they are provided with examples of suc cessful programs. One of the authors knows a teacher who arranged for her students to make a multimedia presentation to the school board about the activities that they were doing in their classroom academic work and communi ty service. What better way to make school board members and administrators see the value of a specialized classroom for students with E/BD in which instruction is emphasized? Mass Media Advocacy As advocates, we need to pay attention to how children and youths are treated in the media. More and more we are seeing the protections of childhood stripped away. Historically, iden tifying information for children who commit ted crimes was kept confidential. Now, children's names and faces are shown on tele vision and printed in newspapers, often even before being convicted of any crime. Through out the Court TV show described earlier, the accused juvenile was fully visible on camera, with his name displayed at the bottom of the screen. Remember, this was during the trial, before any judgment of guilt had been reached. In another example, in 2001 the Austin (Texas) American-Statesman printed a story that a case against a 15-year-old boy accused of murder would remain in juvenile court ("Youth Faces Murder Trial as juvenile," 2001). Prosecutors had asked that the youngster be tried in adult court. While we support the judge's decision, the newspaper printed the youngster's name and picture. Thus, the court ordered that the boy be treated as a juvenile, yet the newspaper treated him no differently than an adult under the same circumstances. Too often, children who exhibit socially unacceptable behavior of any type are por trayed as animals or monsters, not worthy of treatment or consideration of age. An article published a few years ago in the New Yorker magazine used the term "super-predators" to describe a population of violent youths (Traub, 1996). Such harsh judgment and harsh words make it easier for the uninformed to believe that any punishment, regardless of the condi tions of the crime, is acceptable. Furthermore, reverse anthropomorphism in the form of labeling youngsters as "animals" or "preda tors" may make it less likely that others will ask questions about extenuating circum stances, the presence of a disability, attempts by the child's family to get help, and so forth. Negative, dehumanizing media portrayals of children and youths with E/BD undoubted ly affect public opinion, and public opinion certainly influences public policy. For instance, it becomes politically difficult for judges to order treatment for a child or youth with emotional or behavioral problems who has committed a violent crime when the only voices being heard through the media are those crying for harsh penalties. Likewise, leg islators will follow public sentiment in propos ing laws to deal with crimes committed by young people. One-sided views from conser vative-minded talk show hosts, columnists, or other media sources are likely to convince the general public that young people who commit crimes always do so willfully, with no extenu ating circumstances. Furthermore, such views do not educate public thinking about treat 66 / November 2002 Behavioral Disorders, 28( 1), 57-69</page><page sequence="11">ment options or preventative strategies. Thus, it is critical that we counter negative, and often untrue or slanted, attacks on young people with E/BD. Not long ago, the Austin American-States man printed a syndicated column in which the author, Froma Harrop, discussed the role of parents in school shootings (Harrop, 2000). She focused particularly on the parents of Kip Kinkel, the young man who killed his parents and then killed two students and wounded many others at his high school in Springfield, Oregon. This editorial writer placed the blame for these acts on the parents. Ironically, the case she chose to highlight, the Kinkel case, was one in which it appears that the parents sought help and followed professional advice to address their son's behavioral and emotion al problems. In an attempt to counter erro neous impressions left by this editorial, we and many of our colleagues jointly wrote a letter to the editor in which we presented a more fac tual view of the complexity of school violence and antisocial behavior, pointing out that blaming parents is an easy but uninformed response (Scheuermann et al., 2000). Taking the time to balance negative, misleading, and slanted media stories is a tedious but essential chore that we urge every advocate to under take. Recommended Advocacy Actions Media advocacy may be one of the most important tasks advocates can pursue, particu larly considering the role of public opinion in law and policy development. We need to be watchful for media portrayals that dehumanize children or present inaccurate information, and we believe advocates should respond to misinformation. Furthermore, we urge advo cates to be proactive in informing reporters about positive aspects of educating students with E/BD. Figure 1 lists a few examples of advocacy actions in this area. It has been said that the test of the morali ty of a society is what it does for its children. With regard to current trends in the treatment of some children, we would like to alter the saying to read: The test of the morality of a society is what it does for all its children, including those who behave in ways that are distasteful or unacceptable to that society. Conclusion Advocacy begins with each of us on an indi vidual level. It is easy to criticize school board members or local, state/provincial, and feder al politicians for developing rules and policies that are unfriendly to students with E/BD. However, it is more productive to operate under the assumption that most people outside the field of special education, from local to federal levels, are not well informed about our students or about the wide range of interven tions that effectively support our students in school and in the community. Therefore, a sig nificant portion of our advocacy work must be to inform those in policymaking and other influential roles about the needs of students with E/BD. Because these individuals continu ally change, and because our field is ever evolving, the job of educating policymakers is a life-long project. Despite hard-won gains in many areas, the need for effective advocacy shows no signs of waning in the 21st century; in fact, it may be stronger than ever. In our advocacy work, it is important that we see the big picture. That is, we need to consider how seemingly benign attacks, or even simply inaccurate informa tion, are ultimately harmful to our students. With this in mind, we have described three areas in which we believe stepped-up advoca cy is needed: legislative and judicial, educa tional, and mass media. First, it is crucial that we track legislative activity to help prevent passage of bills that will reduce our students' opportunities for suc cess by denying them educational services. With regard to education, the challenging nature of behaviors exhibited by students with E/BD makes these students vulnerable to disci plinary practices that range from illegal to unethical. We must be alert for such practices and speak out against their use. These students are also expensive to educate. The trend toward full inclusion may tempt some schools to eliminate more costly instructional arrange ments in favor of lower-cost options under the guise of inclusion. Because public opinion influences decisions and policies, we must correct negative or inaccurate portrayals of children and youths with E/BD or their families in the mass media. Finally, because we know the value of treatment, we must take steps to try to ensure that children and youths who exhibit antisocial behavior receive treatment.
