<plain_text><page sequence="1">'IS MYTH INDISPENSABLE?' A simple answer to the question 'Is myth indispensable' would be most misleading because there are at least three separate possi bilities as to what that question means. (1) The question might be considering the usefulness of myth for culture, for example as a means of preserving cultural tradition and achieving cultural unity. Most thinkers, except those for whom the 'mythic* salt has lost its savor, would hold that myth is indispensable for such pur poses. (2) The question might be considering whether or not myth is informative about human nature and values, and whether or not its task can be taken over by nonmythical ways of thinking. Think ers inclined favorably toward the 'truth* of poetry and drama as providing irreplaceable insights into human problems would tend to hold that myth here too is indispensable. (3) The question might also be asking whether myth provides information about reality transcendent to man, whether myth has metaphysical indis pensability. Whereas the first two forms of the question arouse considerable unanimity of opinion, this third form produces radi cally divergent types of answers. It is this third form of the question, is myth indispensable as a metaphysical category, that provides the subject matter for this paper. There are at least three types of answers to this question. One may argue that myth is clearly dispensable. One of two reasons may be given, either that there is no religious reality hence myths refer to nothing but man, or else that there is religious reality but myths are totally inadequate ways of speaking about this reality. Secondly, one may hold that myths are cognitive and indispensable but that they must be carefully interpreted if their meaning is not to be distorted and they are to be adequate religious symbols. Thirdly, one may hold that myths are the best religious symbols and thus the only indispensable way of speaking about the divine adequately. Before these answers can be discussed, further clarification of terms is required. The word 'myth* is used in many ways, some of</page><page sequence="2">578 THE MONIST which force a negative evaluation of its cognitive value. If by myth is meant some sort of fictional portrayal, as when the dictionary defines it as "a person or thing existing only in imagination," then clearly myth is not an indispensable category for philosophy or theology. Secondly, by 'myth' is often meant a particular style of thinking, sometimes called 'mythopoetic', which can be contrasted with logi cal and scientific styles. The question of myth in this sense must be separated from its question of mythical symbols since a person could think 'mythopoetically' and at the same time deny the ade quacy of mythic (personal) symbols and vice versa. This definition must be noticed but is not being utilized in this discussion. 'Myth* can be used to designate a particular kind of category, separating 'mythical* from other kinds of symbols, as when it is spoken of as use of imagery to express the "other-worldly in terms of this world and the divine in terms of human life," or as "man's ulti mate concern symbolized in divine figures and actions. Myths are symbols of faith combined in stories about divine human encoun ters."1 These definitions relate to the dictionary definition of myth as "a story . . . that ostensibly relates historical events, which are usually of such character as to serve to explain some practice, belief, institution, or natural phenomenon" and goes on to indicate that normally the reference is to religious rites and beliefs rather than secular ones. By myth in this paper is meant the portrayal of the divine in terms of personal categories and activities, and it is quite clear that one's conclusions as to the indispensability of myth will be a func tion of his views as to the nature of the divine. If the divine is believed to be personal then certain myths may be perfectly proper as cognitive categories. If the divine is sub- or super-personal then myths will have to be interpreted to be understood properly. If there is no divine or if it is wholly indescribable then myths will have no cognitive function to fulfill. Naturalists and mystics, for opposite reasons, incline to the last of these views, classical theists to the second, while some personalists claim ultimacy for mythical language. l Thc definitions are from Rudolf Bultmann, Kerygma and Myth, Vol. I, p. 10; and Paul Tillich, The Dynamics o/ Faith (New York: Harper and Row, 1958), p. 49, respectively.</page><page sequence="3">IS MYTH INDISPENSABLE? 579 A. THE REJECTION OF MYTHICAL CATEGORIES Two rather dissimilar views will be discussed here because both views deny totally the adequacy of mythical categories, although for quite different reasons. Naturalists reject myths because they reject the divine, while mystics accept the divine but reject the adequacy of myth in describing the divine. 1. Naturalism By naturalism is meant those views which take nature, or some part of it, as ultimate. Customarily, this label is further restricted to views which deny that there is any divine being, any person or process transcending the human in value. Those views which call themselves naturalistic but which involve a transcendent being can be included under one or more of the other headings. According to naturalistic views there is no divine reality, unless one chooses to speak of man and his own products as divine. Myth has no cognitive value except as it illuminates facts about human nature and activity. Since myths do not convey knowledge of some other world or order of existence, they are dispensable as meta physical categories. Myths may perhaps be psychologically indis pensable as ways of expressing human strivings or as ways of evoking human responses to certain values but their function does not go beyond this. To say this is not to deny significance to myth, it is merely to locate its significance properly as pointing to man and not to something superhuman. That myth is not cognitive follows from two naturalistic claims: that only scientific method is adequate as a source of factual truth, and that, measured by scientific method, there is no compelling evidence for divine beings, hence no cognitive status for myth. Sidney Hook advances both claims, holding that the use of scien tific method is "the only reliable way of reaching truths about the world of nature, society, and man" and, again, that "no plausible evidence has been found to warrant belief in the entities and powers to which supernatural status has been attributed."2 2 Sidney Hook, "Naturalism and Democracy," in Naturalism and the Human Spirit, ed. Y. H. Krikorian (New York: Columbia University Press, 1944), p. 45. Actually these two claims are separable. One might choose to hold that scientific method does suggest personal beings beyond men, however here we are discussing naturalists and need not consider that possibility.</page><page sequence="4">580 THE MONIST Similarly, John Herman Randall, Jr., claims that religion "offers no descriptions and no explanations whatever independent of man's best secular knowledge."3 What religion does, Randall goes on to add, is to encourage practical commitment to certain values, ta intensify, enhance, and clarify man's allegiance to his "ultimate concern," and to make man aware of the "order of splendor" in the world, but it does not add new knowledge about some order other than the human. Secular knowledge is what provides information about reality and what sorts of beings people it, while religion offers a way of life and vision which man sorely needs in order to be human but which does not add to his store of knowledge. Secular knowledge is cognitive and myth in this realm is dispensable, it is only where the non-cognitive is considered that myth is of real value. Individual myths would be subject to evaluation, presumably^ in terms of their effectiveness and the desirability of the visions they produce and preserve. In a scientific age, the value of classical western mythology has severely diminished and a more human and this-worldly mythology would seem desirable. Naturalism implies the rejection of myth as a cognitive category. Obviously the crucial question then becomes that of the adequacy of naturalism. // it is adequate, then myth is really dispensable; if it is not adequate then its verdict on myth is open to reconsidera tion. 2. Mysticism Mystics are also found among the rejecters of myth but for quite different reasons. For them myths are dispensable because they fail to describe the divine. If by a mystic is meant one who holds that reality is really one and can be known to be such in mystical experience, hence that the world of multiplicity is a world of illu sion, then language must be viewed as a distorting medium. Lan guage is wholly inadequate for the task of speaking about the infinite divine unity since words mean finite things and speak only of the world of multiplicity. It is a well-known fact, however, that mystics do use mythical 3 John Herman Randall, Jr., The Role of Knowledge in Western Religion (Boston: Starr King Press, 1958), pp. 103-04.</page><page sequence="5">IS MYTH INDISPENSABLE? 581 categories, therefore some explanation of the function of myths in mysticism is in order. Stace claims that every "statement of the form 'God is x' is false."4 Taken symbolically such statements have a kind of mean ing, but taken literally they are false. To assert them as literally true would be to imply that God can be described in terms drawn from the world of things. Besides, to assert the truth of the mythical categories which religions typically use would be to imply that God is a being alongside others, related in some sense to the world. Both implications, says Stace, are contradicted by the unity and infinity of God. To speak of God as person, as mind, or as loving, literally would be to enmesh God in process and multiplicity, and thus would be to deny both the infinity and the changelessness which are "part and parcel of the religious consciousness everywhere" (p. 74). What function then do religious myths serve? Two functions at least. In the first place, one may speak of the divine negatively, by systematically denying the adequacy of every possible concept. The celebrated via negativa becomes in Stace's hands a means for total exclusion of every conceptual category. God is neither personal nor impersonal, neither finite or infinite (in the mathematical or physical sense), neither many nor one, and so on. The use of the language of negation must be interpreted, then, strictly in negativiz ing terms and one must not make the mistake of supposing positive content in some of these categories. God is not infinite, he is in-finite; he is not nothing but no-thing. There is, however, an additional function which mythical lan guage may serve, an evocative function. A religious "symbol does not mean, but evokes the experience. . . . Our spirits vibrate faintly in unison with the soul of the great mystic as a tuning fork vibrates faintly in response to the sound of the clear bell" (p. 91). Such symbols do not truly communicate the nature of the Divine to the non-mystic, rather they serve to evoke low-level mystical experiences in those to whom they 'speak*. Although God cannot be described conceptually, since he is 4 W. T. Stace, Time and Eternity (Princeton, N. J.: Princeton University Press, 1962), p. 33. All of the citations in the text are from this book and are indicated by page numbers in the text.</page><page sequence="6">582 THE MONIST no-thing, his reality can be apprehended in mystical experience, and the use of words which rise out of that experience can help to evoke similar experiences. Myths, then, may evoke but not describe; they may be psychologically indispensable as tools for evoking an intui tion of God but they can in no sense describe that God and are dispensable as cognitive categories. It might be well at this point to mention also that Stace's inter pretation of mysticism is not the only one, that there are good interpreters, Mary Anita Ewer, to take only one example, who hold that there is a descriptive element in all mystical symbolism. "When ever," she says, "a person consciously uses symbolism, he must be conscious of a certain analogy between the symbol and the reality symbolized," and, she adds, the validity of the symbol depends on the existence of a suitable analogy between the spiritual and the sensory realms.5 Her observation seems to make sense since it is difficult to see how a mystic's words could even evoke a similar experience in someone else unless there is a resemblance between the meaning of the word used and the experience evoked. Why do mystics use certain words ordinarily and not others? Why 'love* and not 'hate*? Why 'person* and not 'sub-person*? It is plausible to conclude that they think that certain symbols are better than others, even though they might continue to claim that no symbols are literally ade quate. The way of analogy to which attention is soon turned, might be of help here. Both mysticism and naturalism, in their quite separate ways, find value in myths as evocative, but not as descriptive of anything other than human experience. The mystic denies that his symbols describe God on the ground that God is beyond description, while the naturalistic reason is that there is no God. The one rejects language on the ground that God is no-thing, the other on the ground that God is nothing. Brief attention must be given to another variation on the above position concerning mythical symbols. There has been a tendency among some recent religious thinkers to claim that the function of religious symbols is to point to man's relation to the divine, not to the Divine itself. This view differs from Stace's in that it holds that Mary Anita Ewer, A Survey of Mystical Symbolism, pp. 24-5.</page><page sequence="7">IS MYTH INDISPENSABLE? 583 man is genuinely related to the divine in positive terms, and advo cates of the view tend to use the personal categories favored in western religion over the impersonal ones found in Stace. Holding that God in Himself is transcendent, Wholly Other, and therefore that words cannot be used to describe his nature, Dorothy Emmett turns the reference of religious myths toward man himself, but not in a naturalistic manner. Religious symbols refer to the relation in which man stands to Transcendence and not to Transcendence itself. The following statement concerning the cri teria for religious symbols indicates Emmett's views as to the un knowability of the Divine as well as the function served by such symbols. She remarks that the only suitable test for religious sym bols is whether or not the symbol "strikes us as an inevitable way of expressing a relation in which we stand to something of whose intrinsic nature we have no direct apprehension."6 To interpret such symbols properly, then, requires one to direct attention to the situation of the myth user rather than to God. Such a set of claims seems to contain a contradiction. How can one claim to know that he stands in a particular relation to some thing if he has no direct apprehension of the nature of that something? How can one claim to know that God is related to man at all unless he knows at least that God is related? Under the pressure of this very point, namely, that religious symbols cannot be grounded unless one has some nonsymbolic knowledge of God, Paul Tillich was forced to an important shift of position. He pro vided such a grounding by shifting to the view that God is being itself.7 Mysticism also provides a ground in the mystical experience . Dorothy M. Emmett, The Nature of Metaphysical Thinking (London: Mac millan and Co. Ltd., 1953; and New York: St. Martin's Press, 1953), p. 114. For further discussion including comments and criticism of a similar claim made by Martin Buber, see my Metaphysics and Religious Language (New York: Columbia University Press, 1964), pp. 102-04. 7 For Tillich's comment see Charles W. Kegley and Robert W. Bretall (eds.), The Theology of Paul Tillich (New York: Macmillan, 1952), p. 334. William James in "The Sentiment of Rationality" observed that "there can be no greater incongruity than for a disciple of Spencer to proclaim with one breath that the substance of things is unknowable, and with the next that the thought of it should inspire us with awe, reverence, and a willingness to add our co-operative push in the direction toward which its manifestations seem to be drifting. The unknowable may be unfathomed, but if it makes such distinct demands upon our activity we surely are not ignorant of its essential quality." Essays in Pragmatism (New York: Hafner Publishing Co., 1948), p. 19.</page><page sequence="8">584 THE MONIST which is a direct awareness of the nature of the Divine. Emmett denies direct apprehension, hence lacks any such basis for her symbolism. In mystical and related positions, myth is regarded as noncogni tive but indispensable because there is no other way of speaking about the divine and because such symbols do point toward the divine in some indispensable way. For both Stace and Emmett religious symbols point to the religious experience. However, Stace, because he holds that religious experience provides direct access to the unconceptualizible divine, denies that religious symbols describe religious experience, whereas Emmett, because she holds that reli gious experience does not provide direct access to the divine, can allow a more positive descriptive status to such symbols. Neither, however, would say that myth even remotely describes the divine. B. MYTH AS COGNITIVE IE PROPERLY INTERPRETED The main stream of western religious thought has been non mystical, following Plato, Aristotle, and Aquinas rather than Plotin us and Augustine. Within this tradition a quite positive cognitive place is found for mythical symbols. To exemplify this view, some thoughts of E. L. Mascall on what he styles "traditional Theism" will be discussed in their bearing on the indispensability of myth. The position depends upon the cosmological proofs for the existence of God by which not only the existence but also the nature of God can be established. These proofs, it is claimed, establish a God who is self-existent, Absolute, Unchanging, Eternal, on the basis of causal proofs. Roughly it is argued that the world is con tingent and cannot supply an explanation for its own existence and qualities. An explanation in terms of a being who is noncontingent must be supplied. Moreover, because "every effect resembles its cause," "all the perfections that are found in creatures are also formally, though eminentiori mori, in God himself,"8 hence addi tional knowledge of God's nature can be supplied. The way of analogy rises from these two considerations. In the first place, God is self-existent and absolute whereas the created 8 E. L. Mascall, Existence and Analogy (London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1949), pp. 118,123. Further citations in the text are from this book unless noted.</page><page sequence="9">IS MYTH INDISPENSABLE? 585 order is dependent and contingent, hence there is a radical differ ence between the nature of God and that of the creatures. But there is also a similarity because both God and his creatures have being of some sort and because the effect must resemble the cause. Because there is this difference, words cannot be predicated literally of both God and creatures, because there is this similarity then words drawn from the realm of the finite can be predicated analogically of the Divine. Secondly, because the perfections in the world can be predicated of God in an eminent way, words denoting these perfections can be applied analogically to God. They can be applied because the perfections in the world are found also in God, but only analogi cally because God contains these perfections in a divine way. What does a valid analogy enable one to do? Mascall asserts that "Analogy does not enable us to conceive God's goodness as identical with his essence but to affirm it as identical with his essence. Hence all our assertions about God are grossly inadequate in so far as they apply concepts to him, but they are thoroughly adequate in so far as they affirm perfections of him" (p. 120). Thus it is possible to know that God is all-knowing, but it is not possible to conceive what it means for God to be all-knowing since all human experience of knowing is confined to the realm of the human. One can know that God knows, and also that God's knowing bears the same relationship to his nature that human intelligence bears to human nature, but one cannot know what God's knowing is. Every statement about God affirming a quality of him, including the one speaking of God as him, is false if interpreted literally since the literal meaning is tied to characteristics derived from the finite order. However, such statements are true if interpreted ana logically. Myth is indispensable if one is to speak of God at all, but myths are not literally true. Myths must be both affirmed (ana logically) and denied (literally). Critics have leveled many kinds of criticism at the way of analogy but only two will be mentioned. One involves the question as to whether in the last analysis the way of analogy enables one to really know anything about God. Does one really know that struc tures in the spiritual order are analogous to those in the sensory order? And even if one does, does this knowledge really tell one anything about God? To say that God is love but that no one</page><page sequence="10">586 THE MONIST really knows what that means seems to be to say that no one really knows what love in God is. Is one left with agnosticism and merely a set of empty words?9 The other question has to do with whether or not interpretation is so uncontrolled as to allow self-contradictory elements to be concealed beneath the interpretations. For example, the case for traditional theism depends upon causal proofs of God's existence, but these proofs issue in a God who is not related to his creation.10 This contradiction it is argued, is masked by the use of an ana logical interpretation by which it is claimed that God is cause (analogically) but that any intimations of relatedness must be negated as partaking of the finite. The question is, is there any intelligible meaning of 'cause' left if relatedness is taken away? The method of analogy as usually practiced, it is claimed, conceals a contradictory conception of God. Mascall's attempt to show both that God loves and that he is impassible makes use of a different way of escape from this problem. The question is, does God's love require relatedness to or depend ence upon man? Mascall affirms that God loves, stating that God is affected by our actions with an infinitely greater intensity than our fellow beings are. However, he goes on, since God's own inner beatitude is so great it can neither be augmented nor diminished by our effects on him, hence God is not dependent upon man.11 Seemingly, then, God is infinitely related, yet so far beyond that 9 There is an interesting discussion of this problem in Edwyn Bevan, Symbolism and Belief (Boston: Beacon Press, 1957), pp. 310-17, and in Dorothy Emmett, op. cit., chapter 8. MascalFs answer can be found in chapter five of Existence and Analogy. 10 The created order, St. Thomas Aquinas holds, is related to God but not God to the created order. "Since, therefore, God is outside the whole order of creation, and all creatures are ordered to Him, and not conversely, it is manifest that creatures are really related to God Himself; whereas in God there is no real relation to creatures, but a relation only in idea, inasmuch as creatures are related to Him" (Summa Theologica, Part One, Q. 6, Art. 7, see also Q. 6, Art. 2) . Such a view seems to follow from the absoluteness of God. The puzzle is this, if God is established by the cosmological arguments to be the creator then it would seem necessary to attribute relatedness to God, the relation of creator to creation. However, relatedness cannot be attributed to God since, according to St. Thomas, God is absolute. The nature of the God who is proved and the means by which he is proved seem thus to stand in mutual contradiction. 11 Mascall, He Who Is (London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1943) , p. 111.</page><page sequence="11">IS MYTH INDISPENSABLE? 587 which he is related to, that he is unrelated. Is this an impassible passibility? It seems impossible to evade the point made by W. T. Stace when he argues that "if God is related to other things as their cause, then He is finite, since the otherness of these other things limits His being."12 Similarly, if God loves then he must be affected by the objects of his love. The attempt to evade this conclusion through appeal to analogy seems rather hopeless. Lovejoy refers to theism's attempt to combine the Aristotelian and Platonic Abso lute with the Hebrew creator as "that most extraordinary triumph of self-contradiction."13 The use of analogical interpretation of symbols can be used to conceal (but not overcome) this difficulty by negating unwanted elements in an arbitrary way. However, these criticisms aside, the position of traditional the ism is that myth is indispensable in order to speak positively about God, but the understanding of its truth requires analogical inter pretation. Characteristics peculiar to finite reality must be negated. Man cannot comprehend what it means for God to have a property in perfect form, for man is finite, but man can affirm that God has that property in perfect form. Hence man knows that the analogical inter pretation of a mythical symbol is valid but without knowing exactly what it means to say this.14 C. MYTH AS THE ONLY ADEQUATE SYMBOLISM There are two major groups of traditions which affirm the cog nitive adequacy of myth, one is the tradition of popular religion 12 Stace, op. cit., p. 150. 13 A. O. Lovejoy, The Great Chain of Being (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Uni versity Press, 1936), p. 157. It is my own opinion that mysticism can also be rejected for related reasons. Mysticism has never satisfactorily explained the emergence of the world of multiplicity from the divine ground. If the divine produces the non divine then it must be involved in activity of some sort, and this flatly denies the unchangeability attributed to God by the mystics. 14 The quotations are from "Mystical vs. Biblical Symbolism," Christian Scholar (March, 1958), p. 42; and "The Quest for a Biblical Metaphysic," Theology Today (January, 1959), p. 459. In the latter essay Cherbonnier lists as allies in this endeavor a number of Biblical Scholars and Theologians including Abraham Heschel and Claude Tresmontant. A number of the latter's books have recently been translated.</page><page sequence="12">588 THE MONIST represented philosophically in the modern world by a number of Biblically centered religious thinkers, and the other is personality centered philosophy. Neither group would, of course, defend all that is normally called myth, for much mythology is obviously fanci ful, but both would affirm myth as a sophisticated philosophical and religious category. Since God is personal, they maintain, myth ical categories are the only fully adequate ones. 1. Biblically Centered Philosophy There has always been a popular religion in the west which has thought of God as a personal being. Often this view has been maintained by relatively unsophisticated thinkers, the theology of the sophisticated being that of traditional theism as described in the preceding section. In recent times there have been concerted efforts to elevate this view to the sophisticated level, to offer a theologically based Biblical metaphysic based on the concept of God as a personal being. Edmond Cherbonnier has argued that "God himself is a pro tagonist in the drama of history, a real-life drama in which man's salvation is won and lost, here and now." Elsewhere he makes a plea for a "bold anthropomorphism" as the only adequate way to speak about God.15 God is literally a personal being, acting in special ways in human history, therefore adequate language about God must be personal. Emil Brunner, also a strong advocate of a personality-centered conception of God, claims that "Christian faith is faith in the his torical revelation and redemption; faith in the redeeming, reveal ing intervention of God in history."16 God really interferes in the course of history, acting and being acted upon. Knowledge of God is derived primarily from revelation, as God reveals his nature and purposes in specific historical events. How 15 Emil Brunner, Revelation and Reason (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1946), p. 399. is One science fiction writer described the assembling of a huge computer involv ing units built on the surface of a number of celestial bodies. When switched on and asked the question, Is there a God?, it replied "Now there is" and caused lightning to fuse the switch open, slaying the men who reached to shut it off. There is no reason that a personality could not be of such a size or why the universe itself could not have personality.</page><page sequence="13">IS MYTH INDISPENSABLE? 589 ever, both Cherbonnier and Brunner hold that the position is defensible on general metaphysical grounds. Both hold not only that a consistent metaphysical system can be built on this basis but also that such a system is more adequate than any of its metaphysical alternatives. Non-personality-centered views are not anthropomor phic, it is true, but they are logicomorphic or subanthropomorphic. No one, not even the mystic, escapes the fact that the Divine must be conceived in some form or other, and the general categories preferred by classical thinkers are much less adequate than the frankly mythical ones contained in Biblical thought. Anthropomor phism is not mistaken if God is personal. What symbols could be more appropriate if man is "made in the image of God"? The categories which come to the fore in this interpretation of God's nature are person and the various qualities essential to per sonality, namely metaphysical separation from other persons (yes, God is a being alongside other beings, although their creator), mind, emotions, and the ability to act. God is literally related to his creation, affecting and being affected by it, is literally involved in space and time, literally suffers and literally intervenes in the historical order to bring about the accomplishment of his purposes so far as he can. God is a free, personal being with various super powers. It is not maintained that God has all the accidental character istics of personality on the human level. All that is maintained is that God has all the essentials which constitute personality. There are no size limitations on personality for example, although there may be size limitations on human beings.17 There are no inherent limitations in amount of information available or on rapidity and creativity of thought, although there may well be such limitations in the case of human persons. There is no reason, logically, that there cannot be a cosmic person who literally knows and loves everything, hence there is no logical reason why the category of personality cannot be the ultimate metaphysical and theological category. If so, myth is truly indispensable. The basic question then becomes, is such a personality-centered conception true? If it is, then it seems clear that myth is indis 17 D. C. MacIntosh, "Is Theology Reducible to Mythology?" Review of Religion, 4, No. 2, p. 150; and The Problem of Religious Knowledge, pp. 377-78.</page><page sequence="14">590 THE MONIST pensable and that all the substitutes for it in divergent metaphysical systems are dispensable. If it is not true, then the question is still an open one. 2. Personality-centered Philosophy In the twentieth century in particular a number of philosophers, notably Edgar S. Brightman, D. C. MacIntosh, Peter Bertocci, and Charles Hartshorne, have argued for a personality-centered concep tion of God on strictly philosophical grounds. The particular argu ments for their claims are not especially relevant here, only their conclusions are, and it is to these that the discussion now turns. Addressing the question of myth, D. C. MacIntosh acknowledges a willingness to deny the literal truth of many of the primitive, prescientific myths of western theistic tradition "provided that it be clearly understood that at least the most important theological concepts, such as that of a God as a superhuman rational intelli gence and moral will, are to be taken as literally true and their contradictories literally false." Among the attributes of personality that he is willing to assign literally to God is having a body, namely the cosmos itself.18 Brightman and Hartshorne are also both willing to make similar affirmations and both, like MacIntosh, offer philosophical arguments for reaching their views. Hartshorne's views are somewhat different because he holds that there are qualitative differences between God and man. God is all inclusive, for example, and man is not, hence God includes within himself the objects of his knowledge and love. God, then, loves and knows literally whereas man loves and knows only in a qualified (and analogical) sense. God is literally related to and knows and loves all creatures, yet his ways of doing so are only analogous to man's.19 Where classical theology uses the doctrine of analogy to escape relatedness Hartshorne does not. 18 Charles Hartshorne and William L. Reese (eds.), Philosophers Speak of God (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1953), pp. 18-19; and "The Idea of God: Literal or Analogical?" Christian Scholar (July, 1954), pp. 131-36; and The Logic of Perfection (La Salle, 111.: The Open Court Publishing Co., 1962), pp. 133-47. io Frederick Sontag, "Philosophy and Theology: The Argument over Person ality," Journal of Religion (July, 1954), p. 207. It is interesting that W. T. Stace accepts this argument also, but uses it differently. Stace agrees on the logic of the argument, namely that creation implies personality, but rejects the whole complex in favor of his mystical interpretation of God.</page><page sequence="15">IS MYTH INDISPENSABLE? 591 Reasons are often given for concluding that only the concept of God as personal will do justice to the metaphysical functions which God has usually been thought to perform. Frederick Sontag deduces from the fact that God is cause and perfect that he must be per sonal. "To reconcile the fact that some possibles never become actual with the concept of a perfect cause, the first principle of things must have the personal characteristics of will and intel lect."20 Similar arguments have been advanced by the others already mentioned. None of these thinkers would be willing to accept all of tradi tional mythology, and the philosophical ones would be less likely than the theologians to accept the Biblical notion of a God who acts selectively in human history; still it is clear that mythical categories are the supreme categories within both of these personality-centered metaphysical views. Is myth indispensable? Yes, if God is personal. If he is not, then it is likely that myth must be discarded as the ultimate type of metaphysical and theological category. D. CONCLUSION If by 'myth* is meant the portrayal of the divine being and activity in human and historical terms, describing God in language which is anthropomorphic, as a personal being with vastly superior powers who is actively involved in space and time, then the answer to the question 'is myth indispensable?' is 'it all depends upon what God is*. Naturalists deny cognitive status to myth because they deny that there is any God, while mystics deny it on the grounds that there is a God but that myth is utterly inadequate descriptively. Tradi tional theists accept a cognitive status for myth but require transla tion before the truth of myth can be known. Interpreted literally, myths are false, but interpreted analogically they convey truth. Personality-centered theists answer an unequivocal 'yes* to the question. The question, like most philosophical questions cannot be answered in the abstract but elicits different answers from different thinkers.
