<plain_text><page sequence="1">George H. Danton: The Chinese People. New Problems and Old Backgrounds. Boston, 1938. Marshall Jones Company. vi, 312z p. This book is surely one of the most original and interesting studies in the psychology of modem China. The author has spent more than a decade in China as professor at the Ch'ing-hua university of Peking and has evidently made good use of his time by acutely observing what happened around him and by trying to interpret his observations in the light of psychological and historical research. He has come into close contact with persons from all parts of China and from all classes and pro- fessions, and thus avoided the frequent danger of giving a one-sided picture which is only true of a certain province or of a certain group of people. The first chapter gives a very good and sometimes amusing survey of the literature on China and the various aspects that it presents. It reaches the conclusion that there are as many Chinas as there are types of observers; the China of the scholar and that of the politician, the merchant and the missionary, the tourist and the social observer being always something entirely different. All these Chinas are real China but not the whole China, and their sum is not China, because the Chinese mentality that makes the true China is missing in all of them. Professor Danton tries to get at this mentality by explaining his manifold observations though investigating into their histo- rical and psychological causes. The second chapter procures the basis of such an investigation by going into the geographical and ethnical foundations of Chinese culture. Their importance is very well brought out, and some remarks are new and interesting, so the emphasizing of the fact that Chinese civilization is the only independent high culture besides that of Europe which is not tropical but belongs to the North temperate zone (p. I14), which goes far to explain many similarities between both and throws light on the fact that Occidentals usually get much easier along with Chinese than with other Asiatics. The advantages which geographic isolation brought to China are as well set forth as its disadvantages, the latter not only extending to China but also to the Western countries which might have pro- fited a good deal from China's cultural achievements if intercourse had not been so difficult. The concep- tion of China's culture as a river culture is also to the point, and the European reader will be astonished by the close parallel drawn on pp. 18/19 between the cultures of China and of the Mississippi valley, that section of America known as the Middle West. The part of the chapter dealing with the development of Chinese culture is not quite up to date. The importance of the discovery of Sinan- thropus is decidedly underrated; its more than palaeontological value lies just in the fact that Sinanthropus must almost beyond doubt be re- garded as the direct ancestor of the present-day Chinese, as he already shows a number of anatomical traits peculiar to the Mongol and more especially to the Chinese. So this proves that the Chinese have developed, independent from the rest of mankind, on the soil of their country, and thus disposes once and for ever of any theory of immi- gration. The section on the spread of Chinese civilization also needs thorough revision in the light of the excavations done during the last five years and the inferences drawn from them by Creel, Eberhard and other scholars whose works were evidently not yet at the disposal of the author. The paragraphs on the division between North and South and especially on the provincial differences are again excellent. 53</page><page sequence="2">The third chapter is devoted to the language, a theme which, for evident reasons, is generally skipped or very shortly dealt with in most works on China, but which Professor Danton justly regards as fundamental for the understanding of China and therefore treats with adequate length. Though not a sinologist, the author is an expert philologist, and his exposition of the peculiarities of the lan- guage and the practical value of them shows a real knowledge and understanding of linguistic pro- blems, though as a whole his remarks apply more to the spoken than to the written language. The importance of the latter seems to me somewhat underrated, but is clearly brought forth on p. 247, where it is rightly remarked that extensive reading in Chinese produces a special development of the visual faculties "and a corresponding retardation, or at times semi-atrophy, of aural ability ". I can entirely corroborate this from my own experience. Before coming to China, I had far more occasion to read Chinese than to speak or hear it, and so I found it at first much easier to converse by writing than by speaking. If foreigners would take the trouble to learn to write Chinese and to make themselves visually understood, they would escape many an awkardness almost inevitably following from a merely oral command of the language. The following long chapter on " Customs and Ethics " does not want to describe Chinese customs and ethical concepts, but to explain the connection between both and the seeming discrepancies which, as in every country, often exist between theory and practice of behaviour. The chapter again begins with a short survey of former attempts to interpret Chinese psychology, rightly stating that most writers have not taken the large differences between the various classes sufficiently into account. If this is done, the apparent inconsistencies gen- erally vanish. The section on emotionalism gives a very instructive example of this, though one of the reasons adduced for the alleged mental insta- bility of the Chinese, inbreeding, seems to need much closer investigation, as it is difficult to see how in view of the strict laws of exogamy much inbreeding can have taken place. The passages on home life are also very instructive, though there are some points with which, from my experience during my stay in a Chinese family, I cannot agree. So the seeming absence of art treasures in wealthy Chinese homes explains itself thus that they are not displayed in the reception room, generally the only place which foreigners or even Chinese who are not close friends of the house will see, but kept in the living rooms of the family which, contrary to Occidental usage, are the best furnished parts of the house. But as a whole, the spirit of the Chinese home is very well grasped and .adequately char- acterized on p. 98 as "the harmonious union of a maximum of social control with a maximum of specifically conditioned individuality within the control ". The general conclusion of the chapter, that the discrepancies between practical customs and theoretical ethical standards are far smaller in China than in the West, will also hardly be contested. The fifth chapter " Emotive Life" also deals with some features rarely approached in the foreign literature on China. The parts on sex and its con- nection with education, life and literature are especially informative, as well as the lengthy discussion on "face ", this prominent and very difficult trait of Chinese social life. The themes are too complex to be discussed in a criticism; the chapter must be read to be really appreciated. Chapter 6 " Esthetics " is perhaps the most admi- rable part of the book, the more as the author is no 54</page><page sequence="3">specialist in Chinese art or philosophy. The peculiarities and special values of Chinese art are very well set forth, the statement that Chinese art is as a whole expressionistic and in no way im- pressionistic is quite to the point and reveals a true understanding of the theme. The difference between Chinese and European expressionism is clearly exposed on p. 185 where it is explained that Chinese expressionism is absolute and comprises the whole personality of the artist, whereas ex- pressionism in European art is always, where it appears, based on theories and therefore never an inherent trait of art but only a passing mood. The want of allegory in Chinese art is also well pointed out as a chief difference from that of the West, but it goes too far to assert (p. 187) that " Chinese psychology has never developed the idea of personification of abstract ideas ". Such personi- fications are frequently found in Taoist art and literature, only there they are not allegories but hypostases, not abstract ideas turned into images by reasoning but ideas intuitively conceived as concrete shapes. A very good remark is made on p. 176 where it is said that the over-emphasis laid by many sinologists and art-historians on works of ancient Chinese art the chief interest of which is archaeological and not artistic, and their contempt for works of recent times which appeal far more to the layman, is merely apt to destroy the interest in sinology "at a time when it is especially desirable to have as great an interest as possible in this fascinating field ". With chapter 7 " Religion " I am not able to agree in every respect. That Confucius should have been a monotheist and his idea of Heaven that of a per- sonal or even anthropomorphic divinity, is doubtless not correct, and where is it said that he "condem- ned all idolatrous worship" (p. 20zoo)? With the statements in the section "China not mystic" I am entirely at variance. Taoism is as mystic as any mystical religion, and all the attitudes of mysticism and ecstasy, longing for union with the universe and religious abandonment are found in Taoist literature as well as in the practice of Taoist monastic life. That mysticism is closely allied to magic is certainly true, but this holds good of every other form of mysticism as well and is a remainder of shamanism from which all mysticism takes its origin. On p. 2o4, it is forgotten that Confucianism, with its principle ceremonies and sacrifices, has been reinstated as State worship several years ago. The importance and influence of Christianity seems to me somewhat overrated, whereas the renaissance of Buddhism and Taoism is not sufficiently taken into account. But this may be due to the fact that during the author's stay in China, more than ten years ago, the religious conditions were rather different from what they became afterwards. The next chapter "Education" is of special inter- est, as the author, from his own wide experience in this field, is thoroughly acquainted with the practical aspect of Chinese educational work as well as with its philosophy. The comparison of Chinese and foreign, especially American methods, and the description of the as a whole not very beneficial influence of Occidental pedagogy on Chinese meth- ods is highly interesting, as well as the story of Chinese reaction to foreign influences and of the gradual building-up of the present system which is still very far from being complete and working satisfactorily. The characterization of the Chinese student is very interesting and seems quite to the point. The last chapter, dealing with Chinese nationalism, does not intend to give any new facts about this often described and discussed phenomenon, but 55</page><page sequence="4">merely strives to explain it as part of the emotional complex of present-day China. The reasons of the growth of national feeling, its spread and ambitions, its successes and defects are conditioned by China's historical development, and whatever has been done to weaken it could and can only have the result of strengthening it at last. Outward aggres- sion, as the present happenings show, has proved the best means to oust hitherto resisting forces, such as the local governors and generals, and to complete China's union after long dissension, in spite of every attempt to perpetuate the cleavage. The book which is of actual as well as of permanent value may be warmly recommended to everybody interested not only in China but in problems of ethnopsychology and comparative sociology which are here represented under many a new and often surprising aspect.
