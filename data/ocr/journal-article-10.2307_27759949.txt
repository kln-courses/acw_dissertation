<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTER 24 The Chimera of Continuity: What Would "Continuity of Cult" Actually Demonstrate? by James Whitley "Continuity of cult" is one of the major themes in most discussions of cult, religion, and society in the period between 1200 and 650 B.C. (i.e., the Early Iron Age).1 The problem is sometimes seen as a simple, factual one. Can it be demonstrated that cult activity (as evidenced by certain types of deposit) was continuous between the end of the Palatial Bronze Age and the beginning of the Archaic period? The issue can also be presented, however, as a conflict between two views. On the one side are those who argue that the Early Iron Age repre sents a profound rupture in Greek history and believe that Greek Classical civilization owes little to its Bronze Age predecessor. On the other side are the proponents of continuity?those who believe that continuity of cult is not only empirically demonstrable, but that this fact further implies the continuity of Greek civilization itself between the Bronze and Iron Ages. The question is, therefore, not purely a factual one; it is highly charged and relates to different conceptions of what the terms "Greek" and "Aegean" civilization entail. The argument I advance in this paper is threefold: first, that, while the empirical case for continuity of cult has been strengthened in recent years, the conceptual confusion surrounding continuity has increased; second, that demonstrating continuity of cult activity in a particular location between the Bronze and Iron Ages does not support the wider ranging conclusions that its proponents imagine it does; and third, that the question of continuity of cult is the wrong one to ask about the relationship between Bronze Age Aegean and Archaic Greek religion. It is a chimera, a composite beast made of part fact and part fancy, with various heads and limbs (both factual and fanciful) arising from the different interests of Aegean Bronze Age and Iron Age scholars. More interesting and urgent questions should be asked, both about Bronze Age and Iron Age religion, and about the relationship between them. I will discuss the last point with an example from Palaikastro. 1. Continuity is, I think, an appro priate subject (or question) to raise as a token of appreciation for Geraldine Gesell's career, which has been devoted to understanding the role of cult in Cretan society after the fall of the pal aces and before the rise of the polis. I would like to thank Matthew Haysom for discussions on Neopalatial religion (and for a copy of a chapter of his thesis) and Anna Lucia D'Agata for inviting me to contribute and for her useful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.</page><page sequence="2">28o JAMES WHITLEY EVIDENCE AND INTERPRETATIONS OF CONTINUITY First, I must concede that the empirical case for continuity has been strength ened in recent years. The classic statement for discontinuity in Greek religion was made by Francois de Polignac.2 By 1995, in the second (English) edition of his work, de Polignac was forced to concede that not everything materially connected to Greek religion arose, along with the polis, in the 8th century B.C. Activity at many cult sites on the mainland could in many instances be dated as early as the 10th century B.C., and, in the case of Kalapodi, to the very end of the Bronze Age (12th century B.C.).3 This accumulation of empirical evidence, however, has not straightforwardly settled the matter. Rather, it has changed the terms of the debate and sharpened our sense of the differences between developments on the Greek mainland and Crete. As a result, we now have two very different pictures of what continuity actually entails. On the Greek mainland the question of continuity involves a ques tion of origins?the origins of that distinctive constellation of belief and practices we call Greek religion. The belief is, primarily if not exclusively, belief in the Olympian pantheon of 12 anthropomorphic gods, for which we have ample testimony both in Homer and in Hesiod's Theogony. The practices are those of animal sacrifice to a god, particularly involving burn ing of the hindquarters of a large domesticate (pig, goat, sheep, or cattle) on an altar, and the associated practice of depositing votive offerings, or gifts to the gods, which then became the god's inalienable property. These practices later became associated with images of gods housed in structures we call temples. The archaeological picture for practices is still incomplete and difficult to interpret, but it has been clear since the decipherment of Linear B that elements of the Olympian pantheon go back to the Palatial Bronze Age.4 More recently, plausible evidence for animal sacrifice con sistent with Hesiod's description in the Theogony (538-549) has also been found in Late Bronze Age contexts at Pylos, suggesting that something very similar to later Greek sacrifice took place in the palaces.5 Thus, continuity of some kind is undeniable. Questions remain, however, as to how we are to interpret deposits at locales that were to become sanctuaries during the intervening Dark Age, i.e., between 1200 and 800 B.C. It is clear at least that there was a significant shift in the locus of ostensible cult activity away from the palaces. Sites for which early deposits are claimed include Olympia, Amyklai, Isthmia, Ar temis in Mounychia, Mt. Hymettos, and Kalapodi). Of these, only Kalapodi 2. De Polignac 1984,1995. 3.

Isaakidou et al. 2002; Stocker and Davis 2004.</page><page sequence="3">THE CHIMERA OF CONTINUITY 28l clearly dates as far back as 1200 b.c.; the rest originated sometime in the 11th or 10th centuries.6 Exactly what these deposits represent, however, is ambiguous. One could argue that they attest to either the remains of sacrifices or the practice of making votive offerings to a god, but other interpretations are possible. The large number of one-handled vessels from Isthmia, for example, might equally have been associated with some kind of drinking or feasting ceremony Therefore, while continuity may seem the most economical explanation, it is not the only one. Some scholars, myself included, would prefer to emphasize the dif ferences in assemblages dated before approximately 800 b.c. and those of later date. These differences, it may be suggested, indicate changes in practice.7 A major difference is the relative paucity of finds, animal bones, and architecture at all of the sites mentioned above before 800 b.c Crete presents a contrasting picture. There, it has been argued, the deities of the Bronze Age merge imperceptibly into the deities of the Iron Age, an evolution that can be traced in the iconography of the two peri ods.8 There is no lack of architectural or material evidence for continuity of religious practice between 1200 and 800 b.c., often in the same locales. At Kato Syme, continuity of cult practice, as represented by the volume of votive deposits, is absolutely unambiguous and undeniable. It is also (on balance) probable that the cave sanctuaries of Ida and Psychro were visited and used continuously during this period.9 Nevertheless, continuity in practice does not mean identity of practice. There is a clear evolution of preferred locations for cult from the Neopala tial through the Archaic periods. In Neopalatial times, clear evidence for cult is to be found in peak sanctuaries and probably in the palaces (leaving aside the question of cave sites). Final Palatial cult must have existed (the Linear B tablets tell us as much), but the material evidence itself is hard to interpret. By Late Minoan (LM) IIIB a new type of shrine?the bench shrine?had appeared.10 This remained the most common shrine type for central Crete (from Eleutherna to the Isthmus of Ierapetra) until the emergence of the Cretan hearth temple, for which the bench shrine can be seen as a plausible architectural ancestor.11 The difficulty with the Cretan evidence is not in establishing the fact of continuity, which is undeniable, but rather in interpreting the evolution 6.

To put it in the starkest terms, at what point before the Roman period were those sacrificing or making offerings at what is later known as the shrine of Hermes and Aphrodite at Kato Syme Viannou actively worshipping either Hermes or Aphrodite? Moreover, if they were worshipping Hermes or Aphrodite, were they worshipping them in a way that, say, a Greek from the mainland would have comprehended?12 There is no certain answer to these questions, and it does not help us much that, after the Final Palatial period, the names of other Olympian deities (such as Demeter at Knossos) are known in Crete from the late 5th century B.C. at the very earliest.13 Here we have the opposite interpretive difficulty from the one we encounter on the mainland. In brief, if the problem of understanding mainland religion is one of origins, the problem of Cretan religion is one of legacies. Iron Age Cretan religion is viewed not so much as a devel opment from the Bronze Age religion of Crete (which, of course, it is) as a falling away from the golden age of a Minoan religious sensibility, a sensibility uniquely appreciative of the natural world. No established scholar of either the Bronze Age or the Classical Aegean is very much interested in the origins of Cretan historical religion as such?that is, as a distinctive constellation, in its own right, of belief and practice. Thus, though we have plenty of evidence for historical Cretan religion, we have no clear idea of what the evidence we have represents. We do not have a model of Cretan historical religion comparable to the Olympian model that has served us well for the mainland. Cretan historical religion sits uneasily between an imagined Minoan religion and a historically known, mainland Olympian religion. Cretan historical religion is rarely made the subject of either the historical sociology of religion or a proper social archaeology of religion?surely the sine qua non of any serious attempt to understand it.14 Here lies fertile ground for intellectual confusion. It is all too often the case that the legacy of Cretan Bronze Age (Minoan) religion is seen as explaining the origins of historical Greek Olympian religion. This, at the very least, is a highly questionable inference. That it remains an at tractive one to a number of modern scholars is a fact that in itself requires investigation. 12. See discussion in Lebessi 1981; 1985, pp. 163-187,234-236. Both Hermes and Aphrodite are first iden tified by inscriptions of Roman date (Lebessi 1973, pi. 205 for Hermes; Lebessi 1981, pp. 3-5 and pi. l:b for Aphrodite). 13. The cult of Demeter is identified by an inscription in letters of the late 5th century B.C. cut into the flat bezel of a silver ring; see Coldstream 1973, pp. 131-133, no. 14. 14. This statement needs some qualification, as considerable attention has been devoted recently to cult sites in historical Crete, notably by Mieke Prent (2004b, 2005) for the Iron Age and Archaic periods and by Katya Sporn (2002) for the Classical and Hellenistic periods. Both authors have presented major works of synthesis that clarify our picture of Cretan cult considerably Neither scholar, however, has presented a model of Cretan religion in the historical period as a constellation of beliefs and practices distinct from the Cretan Bronze Age on the one hand or from historical mainland Greek religion on the other.</page><page sequence="5">THE CHIMERA OF CONTINUITY 283 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES ON THE CONCEPT OF CONTINUITY Why is it that continuity of cult is thought to be so significant? The answer lies in the 19th- and early-20th-century way of thinking about Greek culture and religion as an essence, that Greek religion was seen as being essential to Greek culture, and that it was the miracle of the origins of Greek culture that early-20th-century archaeologists (particularly prehistorians) took it upon themselves to explain. The terms of the debate were set out in an exchange of keynote articles between Arthur Evans and Ernst Gardner in the Journal of Hellenic Studies. As a departing president of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies (and former director of the British School at Athens), Gardner clearly appreciated the significance of Evans's discoveries on Crete. He was anxious, however, that the new (in 1911) emphasis on origins might divert attention from the study of what remained of supreme value in the legacy of ancient Greece, a point of view best encapsulated in the phrase "fruits, not roots." In his measured rejoinder, Evans put forward a complex and subtle argument.15 First, he showed that concern for fruits need not preclude an interest in roots; indeed, the one should lead to the other. He pointed out that archaeological research had demonstrated that many inventions that Greek tradition placed in Archaic times went back much farther. Much the same argument might be posited for the elements of Greek religion, whose origins could be traced to remote times?including a particular sensibility to the natural world that many modern scholars take to be peculiarly Minoan. Now I am not here to damn Evans, but to praise him. I have no time for the dismissive caricatures of Evans that have appeared in recent years. Evans was a complex, multitalented, and subtle scholar for whom we still lack an authoritative intellectual biography. His interpretations were informed by wide archaeological, classical, and anthropological learning, which it would be difficult for many modern scholars to equal.16 Still, his critics have a point when they observe that he was a man of his time, one who shared the assumptions and preconceptions of the age (though this observation invites the obvious rejoinder that we are all creatures of our time, sharing a number of largely unconscious prejudices and preconcep tions peculiar to our age). One common feature in both of the articles by Gardner and Evans was a tendency to employ organic metaphors when talking about long-term cultural processes. Neither could avoid using terms such as "seeds" or "germs" when talking about origins, nor could they refrain from using "fruits" when talking of results. Though both scholars were clearly aware of Darwin, this resort to organic metaphors reveals that their shared conception of cultural evolu tion was in a sense pre-Darwinian. They viewed culture as an essence, a seed that took root, grew, and eventually died out. Each civilization had its allotted span, and none could escape periods of decadence. While it might change form as it grew, it remained essentially the same from beginning to end. Much of what was essential in a culture, moreover, was a particular view of the universe?in large part, its religion. 15. Gardner 1911; Evans 1912. See now, discussion in Prent 2004b, pp. 22 58; 2005, pp. 37-102. 16. This is most strikingly evident in Evans 1901. See also the arguments in Bradley 2000, pp. 3-20.</page><page sequence="6">284 JAMES WHITLEY No serious scholar with any acquaintance with the social sciences can quite so blithely (or, one might say, quite so innocently) employ such organic vocabulary today It might be objected, in Evans's defense, that he adopted such a language reluctantly, in default of any clear alternative means of describing cultural processes and cultural evolution. Furthermore, the consistency of the organic metaphor, at the very least, lends the argu ment coherence. In many ways, we still share Evans's dilemma. How does one describe long-term cultural processes in a manner consistent with the general truths about culture and society that a century of anthropological, archaeologi cal, and sociological investigation (and debate) has revealed? I, like many scholars, am committed to speaking of processes, but we must admit that the language of processual (or even postprocessual) archaeology is not yet particularly well suited to the task. I would also reject alternative attempts to write a purely descriptive archaeology, free of all metaphor, theory, or preconception. The results of such theoretical (allegedly, theory-free) Puri tanism are often so dry as to be unreadable, and, in any case, old metaphors tend to rear their heads whenever an explanation is required. In the midst of these quandaries, Evans's ideas still have a grip on the minds of modern scholars (even, and perhaps especially, on those who claim to be his critics). Consequently, research proceeds even now down avenues that are extremely unlikely to be productive in addressing questions that now interest historians, anthropologists, and archaeologists. ARCHAEOLOGICAL MISCONCEPTIONS PREMISED ON CONTINUITY In at least one case, the obsession with continuity has led to a serious mis interpretation of existing archaeological evidence. To an earlier generation of scholars, Cretan Zeus was one of the deities who seemed to exemplify clearly the continuity in Cretan religion. Hesiod had described his birth in a cave on Mt. Aigion near Lyktos (Hes. Theog 411-4c\A), and the Al exandrian Callimachus had (gleefully) pointed out differences between the Zeus of Crete and Olympian Zeus.17 Excavation of two of the more famous Cretan shrines to Zeus, the cave of Mt. Ida and the sanctuary of Diktaian Zeus in modern Palaikastro, excited an earlier generation of scholars and encouraged an identification of the Cretan Zeus with figures of young males in Bronze Age Cretan art.18 The latest general synthesis of this god attempts to affirm simultaneously his Hellenic character while not seriously questioning his Minoan origins.19 Nowhere is discussion of this question more intense than in the inter pretations put forward for the origins of the cult of Diktaian Zeus at Palai kastro. That Strabo's sanctuary of Diktaian Zeus is located at Palaikastro 17. See Callim. Hymn 1.4-8 on the difference between Olympian and Cre tan Zeus (as well as the suggestion that the Cretans lie when they say Zeus is dead) and lines 43-54 on the role of the Kouretes. 18. Bosanquet 1905, 1909, 1939 1940. Nilsson (1950, pp. 464-466) is more skeptical when it comes to continuity. 19. Verbruggen 1981, now qualified byThorne 2000.</page><page sequence="7">THE CHIMERA OF CONTINUITY 285 was confirmed by the discovery of the limestone slab inscribed with the famous hymn (the so called Hymn of the Kouretes) in the early years of the last century.20 That the cult can be traced back at least as far as the 8th century B.C. (if not a century earlier) and that it has connections to the cave cult of Zeus on Mt. Ida is clear from the finds of bronze tripods and tympana.21 What is not clear is its relation to earlier manifestations of cult in eastern Crete, although it has been used to support arguments for the continuity and even the identity of cult in that area. While continuity of cult in the same location is evident in at least two sites in central Crete, no such continuity can be claimed for any site in the Siteia peninsula. Caves in eastern Crete were used not for cult but for burial during the Iron Age.22 Even more strangely, while the evolution of cult's architectural forms (from bench temple to hearth temple) can clearly be traced in the part of Crete that stretches from Eleutherna to the Isthmus of Ierapetra/Kavousi area, no certain examples of either type of shrine have been found in the so-called Eteocretan territory east of the western Siteia mountains.23 Bench shrines are found all over central Crete, with a striking concentration in the Kavousi area. Occupation at Mochlos, Palaikastro, and Petras all lasted well into the LM III period, but no bench shrines have been found in any of these sites, nor have any come to light in any of the (sometimes large) refuge settlements of the Eteo cretan country.24 Here archaeology is at variance with local tradition, as recorded by Herodotus (7.170-171). The archaeological picture of discontinuity is exactly the opposite of what we would expect (and what earlier generations of scholars had expected) to find in the territory of those who claimed not only to have occupied this region continuously, but also to be truer "heirs of King Minos" than any of the other peoples of Crete.25 At Palaikastro, these seemingly depressing facts have only encouraged recent excavators to look harder. Since no claim for continuity can be made on the basis of the finds from the peak sanctuary of Petsophas, Palaikastro itself has been 20. Strabo 10.4.6 [C 476], 10.4.12 [C 479]. Strabo says that the temple of Diktaian Zeus is located "at Praisos," though a passage in Apollonius Rhodius's Argonautica (4.1638-1641) suggests that AiKxa may have been the ancient name for modern Palaikastro (Crowther 1988).

For a synthesis of new and old finds in the Isthmus of Ierapetra and the Kavousi area, see Eliopoulos 2004. No bench temples located in the Siteia peninsula are to be found in Prent's recent cata logue (Prent 2005, pp. 126-154). 24. See Nowicki 2000, pp. 49-61. It should be noted, nonetheless, that while no actual bench shrines have been found, fragments of fenestrated stands and a figurine "of Gazi/Karphi type" (now lost) have been reported from Kipia Kalamafki, close to Praisos. For the figurine, see Platon 1952, p. 481; for discussion, see Whitley, Prent, andThorne 1999, pp. 238-242. No plausible structure that could have served as a bench shrine has so far been identified on this site, however. 25. See discussion by Whitley (1998) arguing against Bosanquet (1939-1940). Eastern Crete's striking picture of discontinuity both in the locales and the practice of cult, such that no regional evolution of cult practice can be traced in this area, may be related to the phenomenon of "ruin cults," where, from the 8th century on ward, Archaic cult activity was located over the ruins of earlier Bronze Age structures (see Prent 2003). In this sense, the archaeological pattern in eastern Crete is markedly similar to that of the Archaic Argolid (see An tonaccio 1994; 1995, pp. 12-65) and markedly dissimilar from that of cen tral Crete.</page><page sequence="8">286 JAMES WHITLEY scoured for any evidence at all for cult, and in its so-called Kouros the excavators think they have found it.26 The lithochryselephantine Kouros was discovered in the small plateia outside of building 5 during the first season of the renewed Palaikastro excavations. It was broken in many pieces and had been burned, and it was obvious to the excavators that it was not in its original location. Its context was LM IB and, thus, it was naturally interpreted as a casualty of the general destruction of the site, attributed to outsiders or invaders. It is a complex piece, made of several types of material (gold, ivory, and steatite), and has been hailed as the earliest example of a chryselephantine statue in Greece. The obvious interpretation?following the logic of the argument of continuity?is that it represents a cult statue (or perhaps votary) of that young, male Minoan god who is the cultic ancestor of Diktaian Zeus.27 If this statue represents a god, then in which of the now fully excavated, nearby buildings was his shrine located? Where are the other objects that go with his cult? The excavators have presented answers to these questions, but none of them are satisfactory The shrine is said to be a "house shrine" in the entrance to building 5.28 If so, it is a shrine that is hardly set apart from its surroundings and one that is largely without cult equipment or votive offerings. The cult deposits are said to be found in a pit, but the contents of this pit compare poorly both with the finds from the later temple of Diktaian Zeus, from which it is some distance away, and with the slightly earlier finds from the peak sanctuary at Petsophas.29 Such objections will not persuade those archaeologists who are commit ted to a vision of Minoan (particularly Neopalatial) society as one that was deeply ritualized and whose members felt a close (and continuous) kinship to the natural world, the stars, and the divine. Nevertheless, if ritual becomes a part of everyday life, it ceases to be ritual in any meaningful sense, especially in the sense that would support a general argument for continuity There is an alternative approach to understanding the lithochrysele phantine Kouros and for explaining why such a complex and well-crafted piece was found broken into so many fragments. Adopting such an ap proach, however, requires that we try to divest ourselves of some of the art historical terminology ("cult statue," "Kouros") that Aegean prehistory has inherited from Classical archaeology. Chief among these is the very notion of art, defined as an object that, because of its outstanding beauty and/or the degree of skill and expertise devoted to its manufacture, must be preserved intact at all costs, preferably in a museum. Art is our ethnocentric conception of what such an object ought to be. It is not one that is widely shared, as any anthropologist of material culture knows. Indeed, in many cultures, objects are made with a specific social or cultic purpose in mind; 26. Gesell (1985,118-120) lists a number of Neopalatial and LM III deposits at Palaikastro (none a bench shrine) that she interprets as "cultic" or "ritual." For a skeptical view, see now Haysom 2005, pp. 184-200. 27.

These anthropological observations have encouraged a more general move in archaeology and anthropology to investigate the social agency of objects and to understand how they can function as "persons" within the life of a particular community.30 Paul Rehak has pioneered such an agency approach to the study of Minoan bull's heads and other highly decorated stone rhyta. He has demonstrated that the more highly decorated and richly worked examples of rhyta have been found, almost invariably, in several parts. The more richly worked a rhyton, the more likely it is to be found broken, and vice versa.31 The fragmentary state of the Palaikastro Kouros suggests that Rehak's approach may prove a productive one to apply to this class of lithochryselephantine objects as well. Before making some positive proposals, let me sum up the negative arguments with regard to continuity of cult: 1. The Cretan and Greek mainland sequences represent separate and distinct forms of religious evolution. The legacy of one cannot legitimately be used to explain the origins of the other; 2. We still lack an adequate description or model of Cretan his torical religion. Such a model is absolutely necessary if we are adequately to describe the history of Cretan religion as it developed from the Bronze to the Iron Age; 3. The effects of looking at Greek and Minoan culture as essences are still with us and are still leading scholars to ask the wrong questions. TOWARD A NEW AND BETTER SET OF QUESTIONS In view of the preceding discussion, what is the right approach to ancient religion? There can, of course, be no single right approach. Even so, some questions are more pertinent, and some methods are better suited to ad dressing certain questions, than others. An example of how a general approach derived from the sociology of religion can help us view the evidence in new ways is provided by Robert Parker's discussion of the Panathenaia festival in 6th-century Athens. Although one could easily engage in a long and inconclusive discussion of the origins of the festival, and what (if anything) it might have to do with Bronze Age Attica, Parker does not do this.32 Rather, he accepts that the festival has to be older than 566 B.C., and that there was a 6th-century reorganization of the festival around this date (exactly when does not much matter). The crucial consideration for Parker is the difference between an informal festival, perhaps not too different from the numerous panigyris held on saints' days in modern Greece that require little organization be yond the cooperation of certain kin or local groups, and a festival set up to impress the rest of Archaic Greece and to compete in esteem with the established panhellenic festivals of Olympia and Delphi. 30. For this perspective, see in par ticular articles in Appadurai 1986. The most sophisticated argument for an agency approach is provided by Gell (1998). 31. Rehak 1995. 32. Parker 1996, pp. 66-101.</page><page sequence="10">288 JAMES WHITLEY The latter type of festival requires the intervention of the state. Mar shals have to be chosen, officials must be appointed, someone has to arrange for the right number and type of animals for sacrifice, and a number of other tasks must be managed. An organized Panathenaia implies state power and a reordering of political and social relations. In other words, what is important about the Panathenaia is not its origins as a festival, but how our understanding of its development helps us interpret the development of polis religion and thus state power. There are many questions concerning the evolution of religion from the Bronze to the Iron Age that we have not begun to answer.33 In the context of Crete, we still have a very poor conception of the relationship of cults to the palaces in either the Neopalatial or Final Palatial (LM II LM III A) periods. To what extent was religion in either period a Palatial religion or a collection of informal cults with no state intervention in their organization? Similarly, for the Archaic and Classical periods, we should explore the extent to which Cretan historical religion was a polis religion, analogous to that of contemporary Athens. If we are ever to write a proper social archaeology of the relationship between Aegean Bronze and Iron Age religions, we must begin seriously to address questions such as these.
