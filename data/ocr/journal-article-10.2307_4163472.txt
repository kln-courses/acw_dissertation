However, identifying the New Brunswick highlands as the "southern edge of the continental range" for the Blackpoll overlooks the disjunct population well documented by the New York breeding bird atlas (1988) in the Adirondack and Catskill mountains, more than 300 km to the south. Most species accounts end with notes on conservation issues and population trends. A wide range of comments conjecture on future status. In an extreme example, the Golden-crowned Kinglet account comments that "their long-range future here is uncertain." That, for a species found in more than 80% of squares, with an estimated population of 355,000 pairs, and an increasing BBS trend! A passing mention of nuclear wastelands and repetitious references to global warming sometimes diminish the environ- mental comments to rhetoric. Brief accounts and a single map each for 26 species identified as peripheral and casual follow the main body of the work, two per page. Inclusion of Bohemian Waxwing in this section broadens the description of this section to include hypothetical species (by the au- thor's own admission) and detracts from the list. Lists of past breeders, species with non- breeding summer records, and recently introduced species conclude the species accounts. Thoughtful groupings of species by habitat and range limits are presented in chapter VII. Four appendices provide technical references which make this among the best documented of published atlases. Features included here rival the documentation included in the Atlas Handbook, and make this a valuable reference for anyone interested in initiating an atlas effort. Descriptions of data processing and review demonstrate that this was a well designed project. Chapter VIII summarizes and explains the innovative population estimates computed for each species. The process of computing these estimates, described in Appendix D, is essential, but probably will leave most readers confused. The analytical technique appears to be valid, although caution should be used in interpreting the resulting estimates because of species detectability problems, subjective "trimming" of records and sampling intensity, all of which are acknowledged as issues. A final appendix includes five statistical tables, summarizing the raw data of the atlas. This atlas was handsomely designed and packaged with the reader in mind. The publi- cation will serve well the many birders that visit the Maritimes and is a grand tribute to the residents who labored to produce it. Covering an area toward the northeastern corner of the continent, the Atlas of Breeding Birds of the Maritime Provinces is an essential reference for anyone interested in bird distributions in North America.-DANIEL W. BRAUNING. THE HUMAN NATURE OF BIRDS. By Theodore Xenophon Barber. St. Martin's Press, New York. 1993:226 pp., 12 color photographs with captions (bound in center as 8 plates). $19.95 (U.S.), $26.99 (Canada).-It is said that anyone with a magnifying glass on a string around his or her neck must be a botanist, and I propose that anyone similarly adorned with the albatross of "instinctual" must be a psychologist. It is a perfectly valid dictionary entry, but in a world in which everyone else uses "instinctive" the reader knows from the very first paragraph of this book's Introduction that the author is a psychologist-although he describes himself in the opening sentence as "a behavioral scientist, with a professional reputation as a hard-headed skeptical researcher." The stereotypical psychologist's knowl- edge of avian behavior is restricted to the output record from a Skinner box within which a White Carneaux pigeon is pecking at an illuminated key, so The Human Nature of Birds portends an unusual viewpoint on the stated content of human-like cognitive capacities of our feathered friends. The topics range widely: talking birds, food caching, tool using, territoriality, foraging, communication, song, migration and navigation, and so on. There is an appendix on the 580</page><page sequence="2">ORNITHOLOGICAL LITERATURE "continuing cognitive ethology revolution" and another on "how you can personally ex- perience a bird as an intelligent individual." A third appendix provides Latin names of species mentioned in the text, followed by "notes" (mainly references) serially numbered within chapters, and an index. It is a nice package but the white typeface within black banners at the top of each page and heading each chapter is often unreadable in my copy. In any popularization such as this the paramount question is one of accuracy: are the facts and interpretations right, is the documentation sound? Given the enormous breadth of ma- terial, the author has done a reasonable job, but not a meticulous one. At the least one would hope for standard names of birds, spelled correctly-not such things as the "North American Nuthatch Sitta pussila" (p. 174) which is presumably the Brown-headed Nuthatch Sitta pusilla (one s, two l's). I am not picking nits; with some 9000 species of birds in the world, it is an absolute requirement that we know which one is being discussed. The "great shearwater" of page 58 may be recognizable as the Greater Shearwater (Puffinus gravis) to those of us familiar with the European literature, but the former is not listed in Appendix C on "Scientific Names of Species" and the latter is given there under its nineteenth century generic name. Chapter five is about a hand-reared jay called a "scrub jay" (p. 40), but the popular book on which the chapter is based is entitled Lorenzo the Magnificent: The Story of an Orphaned Blue Jay (p. 191), so which is the right species? The literature citations are impressive, but careful reading suggests that many are cribbed from secondary sources such as The Life of Birds by Welty and Baptista (e.g., scrutinize the notes on pp. 183-185). Was the author really able to read Homberg's paper about "Fiskande krakor" (fishing Hooded Crows) as cited on p. 11 and listed on p. 182? When I list a paper in Swedish or Norwegian, I have (admittedly painfully) plowed my way through it; otherwise I tell the reader through whose eyes I think I know the content. The book clearly targets recent findings, continually touted as revolutionary, whereas some fa- miliarity with original literature would have provided a more accurate setting. For example, the compressibility of territories is supposedly a new finding (p. 15), but in fact was an- nounced to the world before I was born-by Julian Huxley in an immediately classic paper in British Birds in 1934 (not cited in this book, of course). Which brings me to the "strawmanism" that permeates the volume. The book's thesis is provided up front, as they say, on the first page of the Introduction: "Since I had previously accepted the official scientific view that birds are instinctual automata, I was horrified to realize that I and virtually all other scientists have been blocked by the official taboo against anthropomorphism from perceiving the nature of reality, beginning with the intelligent na- ture of our close neighbors, the birds." That quote typifies the high-level confusion that dominates the structure of this book, so I will attempt partial disentanglement of this web with four specific points. First, this reputedly "official scientific view" that birds are nothing more than little windup toys is a fignewton of the author's imagination. Over and over again in the book we are told of this view. It was never an official or even an unofficial view-in fact, never even a view-in the two sciences I dabble in, namely ethology and ornithology. So I am led to conclude that the author's brand of psychology must have official views and that those views are pretty naive when it comes to birds. Second, any supposed taboo against anthropomorphism never inhibited the research of anyone I know. In fact, anthropomorphism is not even the issue in cognitive ethology. It is simply not scientific to attribute human characteristics to inanimate objects, animals, or natural phenomena and let it go at that. So in that sense, the taboo still exists. Third, the real issue at stake has been how to identify and analyze complex behavior. Our advances have not all been sudden and recent, but rather episodic over a long period, and dependent upon the ingenuity of individual researchers, not the shedding of reputed 581</page><page sequence="3">THE WILSON BULLETIN * Vol. 106, No. 3, September 1994 taboos. Ethology first had to prove that observed avian behavior must involve impressive complexities, and then to devise methods for analyzing those complexities. For example, Irene Pepperberg's comprehensive studies of Alex, a talking African Grey Parrot (Psittacus erithacus), have elucidated avian concept formation in a manner that no previous investi- gator could think of a way to approach. As clever as Alex is, remember that Pepperberg is really the clever one. In recounting Alex's story (pp. 4-8), the author misses this point entirely. Last, this book seriously confounds a host of distinct concepts such as emotional orga- nization, individual personalities, intelligence and cognitive abilities, human-like traits, so- phisticated communication, and complex behavior. These are overlapping sets and just be- cause given behavior has one of these attributes does not imply the others. Take for example an entire chapter devoted to avian navigation (pp. 58-73). The book promises (p. 3) to show that "birds are superior to humans in other kinds of intelligence (such as navigational intelligence)." I grant readily that many avian species are far superior to me, and presumably my conspecifics, in navigational abilities, but to confound this marvelous accomplishment with the notion of "intelligence" simply is not intelligent. Even a disappointed reviewer has a responsibility to identify the good, so take this "did you know?" quiz. (1) When asked what object is red wood, Alex the parrot can pick it out from among various colors of wooden objects and various red objects made from cork, cloth, paper and so on. (2) Certain ground-nesting birds lead a potential predator away from the nest site by a "broken wing" distraction display. (3) Herons have been seen dropping bread onto water and then catching the fish that rise to nibble the bait. (4) Bird calls may "mean" different things to companions depending upon the context. (5) Bowerbirds dec- orate their structures with flowers and other colorful objects. (6) Homing pigeons and some diurnal migrants use a sun-compass in conjunction with an internal clock to help find their way. (7) Starlings can learn to imitate human speech and use certain phrases in appropriate contexts. (8) Some birds are known to engage in play behavior. That sample suffices. If you already knew those things, you probably would not learn much by reading this book. If such facts are new, then this book is as convenient a way to acquire them as any. Just read the specific accounts and ignore the relentless hyperbole about how everyone believed otherwise-and don't take species' identifications seriously. The author's ultimate namesake, Xenophon (430?-355? B.C.), is remembered mainly for leading the retreat of the Ten Thousand from Persia in 401 B.C. Xenophon found only simple pleasure and delight in Athenian life, overlooking the deeper implications articulated by his older and somewhat brooding contemporary Thucydides. Our only knowledge of Socrates comes from Xenophon and his co-disciple Plato, the former respecting his master for the practical wisdom imparted, such as how to run a complex household efficiently, apparently missing entirely the philosophical content expounded by Plato.
