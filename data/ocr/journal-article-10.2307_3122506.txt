<plain_text><page sequence="1">RESEARCH NOTE NEW LIGHT ON THE "MAN IN THE CLARET COLORED COAT" John M. Werner In April 1834, New York City held its first democratic mayoral election. Immediately prior to the election the partisan rhetoric of the Whigs and Democrats, particularly over the Bank of the United States, produced an explosive situation. Held over a three-day period, the election degenerated into a series of bloody riots. Some sailors friendly to the Whigs had built a miniature replica of the frigate U.S.S. Constitution and mounted it on wheels. They pulled it through the city and, to the consternation of the Jacksonians, sometimes used it to provide rides to the polls. On the last day the disagreements about the replica set off the most violent rioting yet. It was attacked by a crowd of Democrats, and several Whigs came to its rescue. The number of brawlers on both sides continued to escalate as more and more people rushed to join the fray. Hearing a rumor that the Jackson men planned to seize the state arsenal located in the city, a faction of the Whigs, fearing for its safety, temporarily occupied the arsenal. The militia finally had to be called out to restore order. The centricity of the Constitution replica in provoking vio- lence in the April elections in New York may have been responsible for an act of vandalism committed on the real Constitution several months later. On the stormy evening of July 2, 1834, while the frigate was moored at the Boston Navy Yard, her Jackson figurehead was decapitated by an unknown person or persons. Whether there was any direct connection Mr. Werner is a member of the Department of History at Western Illinois University, Macomb.

John W. Ward, in Andrew Jackson: Symbol for an Age (New York 1955), 121-122, 248n, 249n, describes the mutilation of the figurehead. Ward refers to the incident in connection with a cartoon depicting the event. The illustration shows Jackson's head being carried away by an anthropomorphic coat. The caption reads, "The Decapitation of a Great Blockhead by the Mysterious agency of the Claret coloured Coat." Analyzing the cartoon, Ward says that while it is not known where it first appeared, nor by whom it was done: My guess [is] that it appeared in New York. [This] is based on the fact that Henry R. Robinson, who was doing most of the political cartoons of that time, was in New York and about the same time the New-York Daily Advertiser carried an editorial with the sentence that 'the frigate, however, with whatever block she may have for a head, go where she may, will have the best wishes of every American.' . . . The repetition of the phrase, blockhead, Robinson's whereabouts, the fact that the frigate went to New York City from Boston, all seem strong circum- stantial evidence in this instance. ... I cannot comprehend the reference to the 'claret-coloured coat'. . .. Dorothy Waples (The Whig Myth of James Fenimore Cooper. . . pg. 95) identifies a contemporary pamphleteer, Edward Sherman Gould, as the man in the claret-coloured coat but does not explain the significance of the reference. There was also published anonymously a novel, The Sheep Rider; or, The Old Boy in the Omnibus. By the Man in the Claret-Colored Coat (New York, [1843]), which . . is attributed to Gould. Here again, however, the significance of the phrase is not revealed. Ward's surmise that the cartoon was done in New York City is undoubtedly correct, but he is mistaken in his tentative identification of Edward Gould as the man in the claret-colored coat. It is now possible to identify this individual and to explain the significance of the expression. Henry Arcularius, a Jacksonian Democrat, was Commissary General of New York in 1834 and, as such, was entrusted with the state arsenal. He lived with his family in a residence on the property. During the Election Riot, Arcularius had unsuc- cessfully resisted the Whig mob's seizure of the arsenal. A</page><page sequence="3">RESEARCH NOTE 97 couple of weeks later, the state legislature told Arcularius to give it a written report of the takeover. He complied with a detailed report which is reprinted in the Documents of the Board of Aldermen, V., Doc. # 29, 321-331 (New-York Historical Society), and the New York Post, April 28, 1834. In his report, Arcularius referred several times to one of the leading members of the mob as "the fellow with the claret colored coat on." In his report (deleted from the Board of Aldermen's version but in the New York Post) Arcularius also said: "Upon subsequent inquiry, I have ascertained . . . that the following persons were among the rioters ... ." He listed twenty-three names; one of them was Simeon Draper. It is now clear that he was the man in the distinctive coat. Appleton's Cyclopedia of American Biography, II, 229, merely identifies Draper as a New Yorker, born in 1804, and active in Whig politics in New York City. Benson J. Lossing, however, in his History of New York City (2 vols., New York 1884), I, 315, 319, explains the circumstances behind Draper's presence at the arsenal. The sheriff had sworn him in as one of a band of special constables recruited the previous day by James Wat- son Webb, a prominent Whig, to help preserve order during the election. Anticipating an attack on the arsenal, Draper had been placed in charge of a band of these special constables at the arsenal. Lossing says that Arcularius, a partisan Democrat, made a "most ridiculous" report of the arsenal's seizure. Lossing identifies Draper as the man in the claret-colored coat and says that he "was active in keeping back the mob in front of the arsenal after the arrival of his political friends." Lossing also says that Draper's friends and the public generally were so amused by Arcularius' report that the expression "the man with a claret-colored coat on" was "long a phrase in political circles in the city." In short, New York Whigs used it as a means of poking fun at Jacksonians. Lossing had moved to New York City in 1832 (see his History, I, 65), and thus was a resident at the time of the Election Riot. His evidence, therefore, may be taken at first hand. There is one problem-was Draper a rioter, as claimed by Arcularius, or was he fulfillng his duty as a constable and helping to keep the peace? It is impossible to say with certainty. It is conceivable he was both at different times during the day. Anyone who remembers Chicago in 1968 knows it is possible</page><page sequence="4">98 JOURNAL OF THE EARLY REPUBLIC for police to turn into rioters. On the other hand, Draper was an acquaintance of the wealthy diarist Philip Hone (see the entry for April 12, 1834, in Bayard Tuckerman, ed., The Diary of Philip Hone, 1828-1851 [New York 1889] ). That would seem to make him an implausible rioter. Perhaps, ultimately, Drap- er's actions that day were in the eye of the beholder. But rioter, peacekeeper, or both, there is no doubt that Simeon Draper was the man in the claret-colored coat. For a confirming identification, see Emmons Clark, History of the Seventh Regiment of New York (4 vols., New York 1890), I, 216-217. While criticizing Arcularius' report as being wildly exaggerated, he concurs that Simeon Draper was "the man with the claret-colored coat on." Clark refers to Draper as "long a distinguished citizen of New York and at that time a young and ardent Whig, who was very active and prominent in keeping back and dispersing the crowd in front of the arsenal after its capture by his political friends." If this is an accurate description of his activities at the arsenal, it is no wonder poor Arcularius was somewhat confused about Draper's role. Clark confirms that the phrase, "the man with a claret-colored coat on" was familiar for a long time in New York City.</page></plain_text>
