<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE STRUCTURE OF DEVELOPMENT: A REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL STRUCTURES BY SAN DOR BRENT Susan Sugarman Princeton University Psychological and Social Structures. Sandor B. Brent. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, 1984. Pp. xii + 316. $36.00 hardcover. Brent, in Psychological and Social Structures, attempts to unify a diversity of so cial, psychological, and physical phenomena under the rubric of structure and related concepts (e.g., form/function, organization, development). Although the book is impressive in its scope and clarity, the question arises of how much of psychological development is appropriately to be viewed in terms of the func tioning and development of structures. Brent's aim is to bring a broad variety of phenomena of psycho logical and social life, and common modes of understanding these phenomena, under a single, unified framework. That framework is the concept of structure, defined as "any system whose constituent parts may be said to exist in a set of relatively invariant relations to one an other" (p. 9). The concept of structure, in turn, is part of a whole net work (or "concept-field") of concepts, including the concepts of functioning, activity, organization, growth, and development. Brent selected this concept-field because it is widely used across all the modern sciences. He chose to organize his presentation around the idea of structure because structure, as just defined, connotes that as pect of a phenomenon that remains stable across the processes con noted by the other concepts (functioning, activity, etc.) in the com mon concept-field. The book is as much an attempt to explicate these concepts, to explain how we are to understand and apply them, as it is an attempt to illuminate any particular group of phenomena through their use. The book consists of 18 chapters divided into three parts. Part 1 explores general, static properties of structures: what forms they take, how form relates to function, how structures are organized, how they Requests for reprints should be sent to Susan Sugarman, Department of Psychol ogy, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544.

Part 2 begins the study of the dynamic aspect of structures, in particular their functioning in steady state: for example, how they are energized, how activity is generated and by what forces it is influenced. Part 3 continues the study of dynamics, and analyzes the processes of growth and devel opment, where development (not growth) refers to the change in structure over time. Brent does not treat any phenomenon, or group of phenomena, systematically. Rather, examples are inserted where needed to aid the explication of the concepts under examination. The social and psy chological phenomena cited range from the prelinguistic babblings of the 15-month-old child to the behavior of crowds at a football game or whole nations at war. Brent uses the arrival, spectating, and depar ture patterns of crowds at a football game, for example, to illustrate some of the major concepts he applies to the formation and dissolu tion of structures. The language used by beginning and mature speak ers of the same tongue is used to illustrate such properties as the functional autonomy of a structure from its context (the more mature language is more autonomous in this sense) or such developmental principles as differentiation and hierarchic integration. Interspersed with these examples of social and psychological phenomena are numerous and diverse illustrations from the biologi cal and physical sciences, such as particle physics, molecular biology, and genetics. In the early phases of people's preparations to depart for a football game, the relation among the individuals (namely, a lack of any direct interaction) is analogous, Brent says, to certain aspects of molecular gases (p. 98). In drawing admittedly drastic analogies of this kind, Brent tries to do two things. First, he attempts to give as clear an explication as he can of his theoretical concepts, abstracted from any specific phenom enon. Second, he attempts to push the commonalities, across phe nomena and across disciplines, as far as they will go, precisely so he can begin to articulate critical differences between the phenomena, and disciplines. Thus, for example, although Brent sees in the release of children at recess certain "thermodynamic aspects" that parallel the consequences of increasing the fluidity of a molecular system (Ch. 8), he hastens to point out that the "catalyst" in the case of the chil dren is a symbolic act, not, for example, the direct heating up of the "system" (p. 117). Psychological and Social Structures is a thoughtful and erudite book, and is written clearly. It has some useful and well-turned dis tinctions, as in the distinction between growth and development, or distinctions between different levels of information exchange be</page><page sequence="3">Book Review 329 tween organism and environment. These distinctions, although not new, are given pointed exposition. The book is very abstract. Not only are the concepts abstract (as was Brent's intent), but the presentation of them is also abstract inso far as the discussion is not grounded in the progressive and systematic explication of specific phenomena. One emerges with an increasingly clear view of the different concepts, but not an increasingly clear or penetrating view of psychological or social reality. This again seems to have been Brent's choice. However, it may limit the value of the book for human development researchers and practitioners. As for the abstract view, one may question what its long-term usefulness will be. Echoing Werner (1948), for example, Brent sug gests that although animistic thinking may be identified in children, primitive adults, psychotic adults, and under certain conditions (e.g., dreaming, myths) in normal, civilized adults, the form and function of this thought is different, in ways articulatable within Brent's frame work, in each of these cases. Freud and Piaget, who also discussed animistic thinking, were less sensitive to these differences, in Brent's view. Be this as it may, there is a serious substantive discrepancy be tween Freud's (1950) and Piaget's (1960) (and by extension, Wer ner's) views of the conceptual basis for animism in children, or primitive adults. Freud held that animism and other anthropomorphic tendencies arise in part through the discovery of the self, whereas Pi aget theorized that the very same phenomena originate from the lack of awareness of self. The disagreement is more than merely semantic (see Sugarman 1986, for a discussion). Although the book contributes to clarifying several widely-used concepts, it seems unlikely that dis cussion at this abstract level will resolve substantive issues of this kind. In a similar vein, Brent concludes the volume with a discussion of the principle of orthogenesis propounded by Werner (1948), and fol lowed implicity or explicitly by many other authors. When a psycho logical or social (or other) structure is observed to change, those changes constitute development, if the changes move toward in creasing differentiation and hierarchization of the structure. As Brent clarifies, the orthogenetic principle is prescriptive rather than descrip tive; it is there to help one estimate whether a given sequence is a developmental sequence (if it is, one should be able to order it with respect to the orthogenetic principle). But development here means development in a very strong sense, namely, in the sense that a later appearing form in a given se quence (say, for the sake of argument, children's eventually very ex plicit understanding of the kinds of properties that make something</page><page sequence="4">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY animate vs. inanimate) specifically emerged from (is a direct transform of, for example) some earlier appearing form in that sequence (say, the odd theories children will express when questioned about ani macy, or, their actual animistic practices, to the extent they have them). Although this notion of forms emerging from or developing into other forms (i.e., of a single structure undergoing change) might aptly characterize the sequence in the development of an embryo, things would seem far less clear-cut in the case of the long-term natu ral development of ideas. The older child's articulate understanding of the variety of the animate and inanimate worlds may have little ma terial connection to the same child's earlier strange answers to ques tions regarding animacy or to his or her earlier animistic "practices." To be sure, Brent distinguishes some structures as more open (to input) than others, and some as more heavily influenced by the input they receive than are others. The problem is that development in psy chological life may not fall into sequences of transforming (or other wise continuous or ameliorating) structures in the same way that structures persist and develop in other spheres, even once we take all of Brent's qualifications into account. The main value of the book should lie in helping us begin to reflect on these issues. REFERENCES FREUD, S. (1950). Totem and taboo. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.
