Pp. xl+456. In From Genesis to Genocide,1 MIT psychologist Steven Chorover shows how conceptions of human nature have been used to validate repressive political institutions ranging from the Medieval Church to control Original Sin, through 'law and order' to control the 'deviance' of 'drug addicts,' to the mass slaughter of psychiatric patients and other 'worthless people' to preserve the 'purity of the race.' One could also add slavery, the subjugation of women, and the rape of the environ- ment. It might seem that a scientific understanding of human nature, particularly in the area of social activity, would be an antidote to the pernicious politicization of conceptions of human nature. E. O. Wil- son, influenced by his upbringing as a fundamentalist Southern bap- tist, and having recovered from being 1^01x1 again,' hoped to apply sociobiology in just this way to take power away from Christian the- ologians who want to control other people's lives.2 He believed that a naturalistically based ethics would allow people increased control over their own lives, particularly in the area of sexual morality.3 His efforts ran afoul of colleagues (represented by Science for the People) who had other social programs in view. This led to a debate in which each side has tended to attack a caricature of the other's position, leaving the real issues untouched. Philip Kitcher's Vaulting Ambition is an attempt to remedy this situa- tion by explaining what sociobiology is, how it relates to evolutionary 1 Steven L.

Written in his witty and incisive style (which, unfortunately, is sometimes facetious), the book is unmistakably polemical, but the po- lemics do not conceal the supporting analysis. Kitcher is careful to dis- tinguish between the general sociobiological project and the specific Darwinian project adopted by Wilson and his followers. He is partic- ularly concerned with demonstrating the lack of support for the theses of the narrow program which might be used to continue the oppres- sion of the disadvantaged. The book is surprisingly entertaining (per- haps not to committed sociobiologists!) given the complex and often mathematical arguments it contains, but its chief value is in its analy- sis of the Wilsonian methodology and its results. Rather than criticiz- ing the program on external grounds, Kitcher shows that it has not met even its own requirements. Kitcher admits that well-established scientific hypotheses should be accepted no matter what their political consequences, but holds that conclusions which can have dire consequences for the misfortunate should be subjected to high standards of evaluation. Speculative the- ories are justifiable and useful in extending the range of science, but special care is required when the speculations bear on human nature. Given the history of the appropriation by the powerful of views of human nature which support oppression, and their ability to publi- cize and encourage these views, scientists should be careful in mak- ing such views available. Kitcher's charge of 'vaulting ambition' is directed at sociobiologists who are so intent on promulgating their pro- gram that they shun or underestimate the need for caution. Kitcher distinguishes between scientific sociobiology, which has had notable successes in animal studies, and may have future successes in human studies, from popular sociobiology, which has commanded the majority of popular attention, concerns human beings, and has at best a tenuous justification. The loaded term 'pop sociobiology' covers not only studies of human behavior, but also animal studies which an- thropomorphize animal activity, such as discussions of 'rape' in ducks or 'altruism' in insects. Although the terms 'rape' and 'altruism' can be used technically, a certain manner of presentation and style of ar- gument can cast them in an anthropomorphic light to suggest illegiti- mate inferences to human beings. Like pornography, this abuse is hard to define but easy to recognize. Kitcher praises scientific sociobiology and criticizes only pop sociobiology, warning that unless the two are clearly separated all sociobiology is likely to be tainted by the pop ver- sion. Even if Kitcher were wrong about the scientific support for pop sociobiology, his distinction usefully isolates the controversial part of sociobiology.</page><page sequence="3">Critical Notice of Philip Kitcher Vaulting Ambition 883 Kitcher does not deny that a scientific human sociobiology is possi- ble, or that our understanding of animal behavior might eventually be extended in some cases to cover humans. Despite the impression that a reader might take away from Vaulting Ambition that Kitcher is against any application of sociobiology to humans, the book's aim is to show that the claims of current pop sociobiology are not scientifi- cally grounded. Throughout the book, and especially in the early chap- ters, Kitcher takes pains to show how critics of sociobiology have missed their target by oversimplifying and misrepresenting the claims of sociobiologists in an effort to make their arguments more accessible to the general public. (See especially pp. 18-24. All page references in parentheses are to Vaulting Ambition.) He also points out that pop so- ciobiologists sometimes exploit these misrepresentations to further their own position (202-3). Kitcher takes pop sociobiology seriously in order to meet it on its own grounds. He uses the sociobiologists' own scien- tific methods to construct alternative explanations to show that many important categories pop sociobiology uses are biased, and that claims that certain behavioral traits optimize fitness are unsupported. The only place that he fails to engage pop sociobiology directly is in the last chap- ter, in which he discusses Wilson's ethical naturalism. I will turn to this after describing how Kitcher attacks the specific results of sociobi- ology, after which I will consider the politics of the debate, and whether the charge of 'vaulting ambition' is warranted. Wilson's Ladder Despite recent and widespread criticism of classical selectionist accounts of evolution, the Wilsonian program is selectionist and adaptationist in orientation.4 Although opponents like Gould and Lewontin have objected to the use of adaptationist assumptions and population genet- ics,5 the classical theory is still the textbook theory, and is well sup- ported experimentally. Kitcher spends two chapters explaining the basics of the classical view before he gives his account of the basis of the sociobiological program, which he calls 'Wilson's ladder.' It has four rungs (126-7): 4 For a recent statement, see Michael Ruse and E.O. Wilson, 'Moral Philosophy as Applied Science/ Philosophy 61 (1986) 173-92. 5 SJ. Gould and R.C.

Collier 1. By using the standard methods for confirming evolutionary his- tories, we can confirm hypotheses to the effect that all mem- bers of a group G would maximize their fitness by exhibiting a form of behavior B in the typical environments encountered by members of G. 2. When we find B in (virtually) all members of G, we can con- clude that B became prevalent and remains prevalent through natural selection, specifically through the contribution to fit- ness identified at step 1. 3. Because selection can only act where there are genetic differ- ences, we can conclude tht there are genetic differences be- tween the current members of G and their ancestors (and any occasional recent deviants) who failed to exhibit B. 4. Because there are these genetic differences and because the be- havior is adaptive, we can show that it will be difficult to modify the behavior by altering the social environment, in the sense that states in which B is absent are likely either to be preclud- ed states or else states that are precluded given widely shared desiderata. Kitcher shows that if we can climb Wilson's ladder for some specific B and G then the sociobiological claim that B is determined for G is justified. He then argues that sociobiologists have failed to climb the ladder. Although he shows that every rung of the ladder is rotten, Kitcher concentrates his criticism on the first and last rungs. These are the most crucial for the Wilsonian program, since they assert the adaptive value of a trait, and the difficulty in altering it. Kitcher points out, however, that even if a trait optimizes fitness, its historical explanation may in- volve neither natural selection nor genetic variation (203-5). At rung 2, sociobiologists must be careful to eliminate alternative explanations; it may just be coincidental that a trait optimizes fitness. This may be unlikely, but a trait established in some other way (say, by deliberate choice) that does maximize fitness will screen off selection. If this hap- pens, the argument from adaptive value to genetic determination is blocked. Kitcher also shows that rung 3 is objectionable, even if rungs 1 and 2 have been established. The problem is with the assumption that nat- ural selection can act only where there are genetic differences. It be- lies a genetic determinism which is tacitly assumed by most selectionists. Natural selection can work equally well on cultures: cul- tural variants based on no genetic differences can be selected for</page><page sequence="5">Critical Notice of Philip Kitcher Vaulting Ambition 885 through the extinction or decline of competing cultures. Biological evo- lution (at least often) proceeds by genetic variation and natural selec- tion; cultural evolution can proceed by cultural variation and natural selection. Failure to reproduce due to natural causes is as fatal to cul- tures as to species. Kitcher uses his example of the scrub jays (141-51) to illustrate this point (203-4), and then shows how it might apply to human incest taboos (205). Attempts to establish the first rung of the ladder have a number of faults. At rung 1 it is important to identify a group and a behavior which are uniform. Otherwise, generalizations are at best questionable. Kitch- er shows that sociobiologists have argued for conclusions about human behavior on the basis of both groups and behaviors which are by no means uniform (151-81). This contributes to the more serious problem that the subjunctive statement about the maximization of fitness of all members of the group if they were to have the given behavior can be justified only if alternative behaviors can be eliminated as less fit. So- ciobiologists have failed, in some of their central cases, to consider al- ternatives which appear to give equal, or, even more damaging, greater fitness than the observed behaviors. These alternatives must be elimi- nated experimentally in order to climb the first rung. Kitcher recounts many cases in which the hypothesized optimality of a certain type of behavior is pure speculation. Behind this empirical carelessness seems to be the assumption that if a certain behavior per- sists, it must be optimal, therefore the existence of the behavior is enough to establish the first rung. The optimality assumption is dubi- ous in itself (see below), but even if it is true, the behavior in question may not be fit in isolation from other factors with which it occurs. The appropriate trait or set of traits for explaining fitness must be picked out from the alternatives experimentally. This is not at all easy. Richard Burian6 suggests that human behaviors under our usual descriptions such as 'aggression/ 'xenophobia/ 'intelligence/ etc. are not suitable for genetic explanation, since it may not be possible to disentangle genetic from environmental contributions in a useful way. Even if only genetic factors are involved, our usual descriptions of behaviors may not be suitable for evolutionary explanation if they cut across natural categories. Kitcher devotes a whole chapter to the Panglossian assumption that behavior which survives must be optimal. Although Wilson is aware of the fallacy behind this assumption, some of his followers seem not 6 Richard Burian, 'Human Sociobiology and Genetic Determinism/ The Philosophi- cal Forum 13 (1981-82) 43-66</page><page sequence="6">886 John D. Collier to be, and he seems to forget it himself sometimes, despite his usual caution. The assumption is used in the absence of other data to justify taking some observed trait to be optimal for fitness, as required by rung 1. Kitcher shows that selection can result in poor fitness, and need not lead to optimal fitness. Furthermore, he gives examples of traits which are a side effect of selection for other traits. All these possibilities are compatible with Darwinian selection being the only mechanism of evo- lution. The exclusive role of Darwinian selection has itself been challenged from a number of sources lately, casting further doubt on Panglossian methodology. The fourth rung requires the most support. Even if a given behavior has its origin in Darwinian selection, it is difficult to show that it can- not be altered by cultural changes. Kitcher describes three ways genetic determination could be established: (1) Appeals to the efficiency of evo- lution; (2) Parallels with non-human animals, particularly the great apes; and (3) Constancy of behavior across cultures. The objections against Panglossian methodology also apply to the first justification. The second justification requires showing both that the behavior is in- deed genetically determined in similar animals, and that humans in- herited the genetic determination. Kitcher argues in particular that human traits might be sustained by culture, although similar traits have been selected genetically in animals, even human predecessors (207-12). Pop sociobiology has typically not concerned itself with giving the re- quired justification. Constancy of behavior across cultures is difficult to establish, since superficial similarities can mask deep differences, and vice versa. Wilson tends to assume that the elements of behavior can be treated separately. This is questionable, since selection for a given behavior in a particular environment will not necessarily mean that the behavior would be exhibited in other environments. Burian's suggestion that easily identifiable behaviors may not be suitable for evolutionary explanation also creates problems for Wilson's atomistic treatment of behaviors. The next part of Vaulting Ambition is concerned with showing in de- tail how the criticisms of the rungs apply to particular applications of sociobiology to human behavior. I think that Kitcher makes his case that pop sociobiological methodology has more than a little room for improvement. He shows that pop sociobiological claims suffer not from a single central theoretical or methodological flaw, but from a large number of mistakes and gaps in arguments from the evidence to par- ticular results. Despite the apparent incompetence unveiled, it isn't clear that we hould expect more from a fledgling science. Kitcher does not show, and did not intend to show, that human sociobiology is impos- sible. I will take up the question of whether pop sociobiology deserves Kitcher's scathing criticism in the last section.</page><page sequence="7">Critical Notice of Philip Kitcher Vaulting Ambition 887 The penultimate chapter deals with Lumsden and Wilson's new the- ory of gene/culture coevolution.7 Kitcher's main criticisms concern their notion of a 'culturgen' and their use of mathematics. Lumsden and Wilson make the simplistic assumption that a culture is made up of independent units (the culturgens), and then apply an elaborate mathe- matical analysis to derive various conclusions. Kitcher complains that the mathematics obscure the simple assumptions. Lumsden and Wilson conclude in particular that (1) sensitivity to usage patterns of culturgens increases the rate of genetic assimilation, and (2) although culture slows down genetic evolution, genetic evolu- tion can occur rapidly in the presence of culture nonetheless. Both of these conclusions help to meet objections that culture can supercede genetic limitations. Kitcher points out that the derivation of (1) in Genes, Mind and Culture loads the rewards and costs in favor of the conclu- sion. The total costs of developing a decision procedure (or a brain) for cultural traits are balanced against the rewards of making the right decision in one case! Conclusion (2) also involves implausible assump- tions. It is based on the assumptions that (a) the advantages of the more successful culturgen are great, and that (b) people are not likely to adopt other culturgens. If these assumptions hold, a trait is more likely to get fixed genetically. Kitcher points out, however, that these assump- tions presume people of extraordinary stupidity. Assumption (b) is ap- parently in tension with the first conclusion. It might, however, apply realistically to cases where the culturgen is not readily apparent to the people who use it. Whether this is what Lumsden and Wilson intend- ed is questionable, but it does suggest further research is required. Another factor affecting the speed of genetic evolution in the pres- ence of culture is environmental variability. Robert Brandon8 has shown rigourously that if there is wide environmental variation, then genetic selection tends to be screened off by cultural selection. Given the cul- tural variation in humans, and the fact that a large part of the environ- ment for culturgens is cultural, it seems plausible that once cultures have become complex and cultural variation has set in, genetic selec- tion will be minor. Under a wide set of conditions cultural evolution can even reduce biological fitness. This suggests that culture not only slows genetic evolution, but that they may compete directly. It is likely that some basic tendencies are biologically determined, 7 C. Lumsden and E.O. Wilson, Genes, Mind and Culture (Cambridge, MA: Har- vard University Press 1981) 8 Robert Brandon, Thenotypic Plasticity/ in James H. Fetzer, ed., Sociobiology and Epistemology (Dordrecht, Holland: D. Reidel 1985)</page><page sequence="8">888 John D. Collier but that culture overlays these, and may even oppose them. Given Burian's suggestion that the important genetically determined traits may not be any that we have common terms for, it is questionable that we can decide the quality or quantity of genetic determination by ex- amining cultural constancies or the biological fitness of cultural prac- tices. Kitcher's criticisms of the conclusions of pop sociobiology confirm this. Given further that not all of our genetic characteristics were select- ed for, and the ability of cultural evolution to take off from any pre- existing trait, it is possible that many of our most endearingly human traits are 'evolutionary accidents' that were never selected for. It is un- likely that the abilities to do higher mathematics, compose beautiful music, or cheat the government on taxes, though present in many cul- tures, were ever directly selected for. The same may be true of our love- making practices, our family life, and nationalism. There are some human characteristics which undoubtedly have a strong genetic basis, including the emotions, our physical development as we age, and our ability to use language. These can be shown to have physiological causes, and all have important behavioral and social consequences. Somewhere in between is the true domain of sociobiology. Armchair Ethics? One thing on which both the proponents and critics of sociobiology agree is its moral importance. Here I part company with Kitcher. So- ciobiology purports to deal with facts, and philosophers have told us that we cannot derive values from facts. Why, then, is sociobiology morally important? Kitcher finds four reasons in Wilson's writings (417-18): 1. Evolutionary biology has the task of explaining how people come to acquire ethical concepts, to make ethical judgments about themselves and others, and to formulate systems of ethi- cal principles. 2. Evolutionary biology can teach us facts about human beings that, in conjunction with moral principles that we already ac- cept, can be used to derive normative principles that we had not yet appreciated. 3. Evolutionary biology can explain what ethics is all about and can settle traditional questions about the objectivity of ethics. 4. Evolutionary biology is not just a source of facts, but a source of norms.</page><page sequence="9">Critical Notice of Philip Kitcher Vaulting Ambition 889 Kitcher finds (2) innocuous, and agrees that the historical task (his clas- sification) in (1), although difficult, is a proper area of scientific study. He cautions, however, that showing the natural origin of ethics would not show it was subjective, any more than a naturalistic explanation of the origin of mathematical concepts would show the subjectivity of mathematics. Kitcher obviously believes that Wilson thinks that ethics is subjective. I think he misunderstands Wilson, though no doubt part of the fault is Wilson's. His misunderstanding comes out a bit in his failure to recognize an important consequence of (1): If our ethical judg- ments are constrained by certain biological truths, then any accepta- ble morality for human beings will have to reflect those limitations- it is foolish to expect people to be responsible for what they cannot do. A failing of many religious and political systems is that they fantasize that people can adopt norms which are beyond their ability. This mis- take inevitably leads to hypocrisy, and also explains the importance to religions of leaders (exemplars) who supposedly embody the norms. Part of the impact of sociobiology, and, I think, the reason why Wil- son saw it as liberating, is the promise it has for restricting what norms people can in fact adopt. Many opponents of sociobiology find this same promise confining. Kitcher finds Wilson's attempts to articulate (3) and (4) confused. This charge is partially correct, but I think part of the confusion is Kitch- er's. He suggests that there is a tension between (3) and (4), since Wil- son believes that ethical ideas merely record the emotional reactions of people, while sociobiology claims to be a source of norms. I don't see the tension. There is a sense in which Wilsonian norms are not objective, namely the sense of objectivity which requires that norms exist independently of subjects. (This is not to say that we could not get a scientific theory of norms which would apply to the norms of hypothetical alien cultures. Wilson specifically mentions this possibil- ity.) Wilson does not, however, deny the objectivity of norms in the sense that there is no truth to the matter of what the norms are. Wil- son accepts ethical relativity, but not arbitrariness. Kitcher quotes Wilson's view that sociobiology might show that re- ligion has no external autority: 'If religion ... can be systematically ana- lyzed and explained as a product of the brain's evolution its power as an external source of morality will be gone forever' (424). 9 He again draws an analogy with mathematics, arguing that just as showing the naturalistic origin of mathematical concepts does not show that mathe- matical objects have no independent existence, a naturalistic account 9 Original in Wilson, On Human Nature, 201.</page><page sequence="10">890 John D. Collier of religion does not show that the objects of religion have no indepen- dent existence. The analogy is a bad one. Wilson hypothesizes that biological laws govern the development of religion, and whatever force religion has comes from those biological laws. He denies that there is an independent basis for religion, given that we can account for it biologically. Whether or not Wilson is right, the case with mathemat- ics is different. Mathematics (like perception) applies to the physical world, giving us a reason to postulate that it's objects have an exis- tence independent of biology. Religion and morality, however, apply only to biological entities, so we need not postulate anything outside of biology. The mere possibility of an independent existence is pretty thin. Kitcher has difficulty understanding why Wilson considers Rawls' ethics to be based on intuition. He accuses Wilson of ignoring alterna- tives to ethical subjectivism and intuitionism because he does not un- derstand them. Given Wilson's assumption that the only objective study of norms involves its physiological basis, any ethical theory that does not study this basis must be based either on subjective opinion or intuition. It might, however, even given Wilson's assumptions, just be another sort of science. Rawls' own decision procedure for ethics10 corresponds on every essential point with Duhem's description of the procedure for deciding what physical theory to accept. Instead of using physical instruments as detectors, Rawls uses a special class of human judges that experience has shown us have a higher than usual relia- bility. Science (or at least Wilson) tells us these judges use their hypothalamus as norm detectors. Rawls' decision procedure, wheth- er he would accept it or not, is naturalistic. The cognitive processes involved in norms, scientific evidence shows us, make use of the brain apparatus called the limbic system, of which the hypothalamus is the central part; hence Wilson's 'hypothalamic imperative' that Kitcher derides. If the origin of our ability to evaluate what Rawls is saying originates in our ethical experience, then it in- volves the limbic system. The limbic system, like most organs, has a definite structure, and functions the way it does in virtue of its struc- ture, which (barring psychosurgery or accident) is genetically fixed. Science shows us that we cannot escape the hypothalamic imperative, although we can't yet say what it is. Norms and their evaluation are natural phenomena, and subject to biological constraints that we must discover. This won't necessarily end fighting over whose moral sys- tem is best, but it might help. 10 John Rawls, 'Outline of a Decision Procedure for Ethics/ Philosophical Review 60 (1951) 177-90</page><page sequence="11">Critical Notice of Philip Kitcher Vaulting Ambition 891 Given the dismissive tone of the last chapter of Vaulting Ambition, I cannot allow one extremely cheap shot to go by unremarked. Kitch- er hypothesizes 'deviants who respond to their "limbic oracle" by wil- fully torturing children' (421). He suggests that Wilson's views would allow us no greater justification for our revulsion and desire to inter- fere than that we have it. The deviant would be just as worthy in fol- lowing his hypothalamic imperative. Notice that Kitcher has attempted to transfer our revulsion for the activity onto Wilson's whole theory, because it has the consequence that there is no non-biological justifi- cation for our revulsion. Of course it would be nice to have an indepen- dent oracle to objectively decide such cases, but the question at issue is whether this is a reasonable expectation. The example is heavily load- ed, since it is not only repulsive, but also biologically perverse. Why should such a creature evolve in the first place? Such are the dangers of armchair ethics. If we add more detail to the case we can generate some sympathy for the 'deviant.' Mosquitos don't wilfully torture children, but they do cause discomfort. Should we hold an intelligent mosquito morally responsible for the discomfort it causes? How might intelligent chick- ens respond to our disgusting habit of eating eggs? What if all of our possible food sources were intelligent? Intuitions of right and wrong in these cases are not nearly so clear. In Kitcher's example we are dis- tracted by the repulsiveness of the act. When more biological details are added, it becomes more understandable. Kitcher thinks that Wilson has special problems with moral conflicts, for example when the reproductive interests of two parties clash. In- deed, there may be no solution short of conflict to prove whose in- terests are stronger. Fortunately, however, there is usually a compromise position which satisfies each party's normative require- ments given their recognition of the facts of the other's existence. I am not sure that classical moral theories can do any better, since they seem to be very adept at producing (often differing) resolutions of conflicts of interest that few opponents with genuine conflicts of interest will accept. Kitcher claims that pop sociobiology makes no serious attempt to face up to the naturalistic fallacy (429). I don't see why the fallacy comes into play. The sociobiologists are not claiming that one can derive an 'ought' from an 'is'; they are claiming that it is a fact that humans have certain norms.11 They deny that these norms are subject to indepen- dent evaluation from a non-biological realm, though their existence 11 See Ruse and Wilson, Moral Philosophy as Applied Science' for further discussion.</page><page sequence="12">892 John D. Collier can be explained, not derived, biologically. Any attempt at an indepen- dent derivation, it seems to me, would be to commit the naturalistic fallacy in reverse: to try to derive an 'is' from an 'ought/ Many classi- cal ethical theories have failed to face this problem. How can an in- dependent ethics have any force in the material world? Hume, who based morality on sentiment, recognized the problem. Wilson is square- ly in the Humean tradition. Far from being philosophically superficial, as Kitcher charges, Wilson shows a rather deep understanding of the philosophical issues, although he could use more technique. Science and Politics Meet (Again) Kitcher recognizes that Wilson has been much more careful in his state- ment of what sociobiology can do than his pronouncements on partic- ular issues of popular concern would suggest. Kitcher thinks, however, that the pronouncements, particularly the ones which can be used to support continued oppression of disadvantaged people, will get the most attention. I have a similar worry about Vaulting Ambition. Kitch- er attacks the particular claims of the pop sociobiologists by showing the weaknesses in their assumptions and arguments, but does not re- ject the sociobiological program in general. Despite this, I think that the reader is likely to remember only the success of the attacks, and take away the impression that sociobiology is of no value at all. Al- though Vaulting Ambition is an antidote to the overly ambitious claims sociobiologists have made, I suspect that we have been given an over- dose. In politics, as in medicine, remedies must be used judiciously. I will not imitate Wilson's presumption and imagine how a man from Mars would view politics of the sociobiology debate, but I would like to make a few remarks. Kitcher agrees that new scientific theories need to make conjectures which might well be wrong. Within limits, the bolder the better. He feels, however, that the issues touched on by sociobiology are so im- portant, and could be so disadvantageous to some people, that spe- cial care is required. This blade cuts both ways. If the issues dealt with by human sociobiology are so important, then it might be argued that we should bring everything we can to bear on them, including our rudimentary sociobiological theories. Kitcher might reply that because people tend to respect scientists, and take what they say as the truth, scientists have a special responsibility to be careful. There is some truth to this. On the other hand, people also tend to respect priests and poli- ticians, and other arbiters of morality. It was one of Wilson's deep con- cerns to break the tyranny of the fundamentalist church. There should be little doubt that religious and political views of right and wrong have caused immense suffering to the innocent through</page><page sequence="13">Critical Notice of Philip Kitcher Vaulting Ambition 893 the ages. Doesn't a scientist who believes he has a remedy have the obligation to speak out as loudly as he can? Perhaps not, if he can't support his views with conclusive arguments. Unfortunately, new scientific views seldom come with conclusive arguments. When a new field opens, the best informed opinion is often radically wrong on many issues. Preliminary hypotheses have to be considered in public debate, weighed, categories changed, and hypotheses revised. If human so- ciobiology were to wait until it was impeccable, it would never get start- ed. If sociobiology has a role to play in the moral sphere, it is bound to have some costs. The question is not whether it has costs, but wheth- er those costs are outweighed by its potential advantages. The costs can be reduced by dealing only with uncontroversial issues, but this would reduce the opportunity for political impact. I don't think any- one can say for sure what the balance of costs is until sociobiology has been around long enough to respond to preliminary challenges. Given our ignorance, all we can do is to encourage constructive and open debate. Kitcher's book contains a useful critique, which can help so- ciobiology to become better grounded. Sociobiologists should read it. Received October, 1986 Revised January, 1987 JOHN D. COLLIER Rice University Houston, TX 77251 U.S.A.</page></plain_text>
