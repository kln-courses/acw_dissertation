<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Megalithic art in the Boyne Valley Dr Muiris O9 Sullivan, an expert in pas sage tomb art, summarises the 'artistic revolution ' which occurred in the tombs at Br? na B?inne. Right: Fig. 1?Detail of kerbstone 73 at Knowth. The boldly carved arrangement of circles within an oval frame was superimposed over the small existing motifs. Notice also the dense picking above the oval. Only 30% of all decorated stones in Ireland lie outside the Boyne region. Yet these stones, totalling approximately 275 and distributed extensively throughout the north and east of the island, offer the purer understanding of insular megalithic art and hold the key to comprehending the Boyne Valley tradition. Whereas the art in the Bend of the Boyne is an eclectic blend of Irish and overseas influences, transformed by an innovative spirit, the art found in the hinterland is relatively homogeneous and probably indigenous. The earliest megalithic art in the Boyne Valley belongs to this native Irish tradition (Fig. 1 ). The tomb builders incorporated stones on which the traditional insular motifs had been represented, sometimes in combinations. A few of the stones, such as the roofstones in the right-hand recess at Newgrange (Fig. 3), carried striking two-dimensional designs, but otherwise the ritual seems to have been more important than the aesthetic impact. The spectacular large-scale arrangements that command our attention today, such as that on the Newgrange entrance stone, were unknown at that time. These later designs represent a transformed Above: Fig. 2?Decorated macehead. This object, from the eastern tomb at Knowth, car ries a sophisticated design which is arguably anthropomorphic. Joe Fenwick. who studied it carefully, is of the opinion that only a rotary drill could incise flint as finely as this. idiom in which visual impact plays an enhanced role. The balance has shifted from art as expression towards art as spectacle. And the key to this changing equilibrium is the kerb of the large tumulus at Knowth. About 90 (70%) of the stones along this kerb are decorated, bearing the marks of an artistic revolution in progress as the inherited tradition was forged into a new. open and more aesthetic style (Fig. 4). The occurrence of superimposed ornament, one motif built over another, shows that the decoration of individual kerbstones at Knowth was not a once-off exercise. The process of accumulation, over an unknown time-span, generated a drive towards increased scale, more integrated designs and an appreciation of the form of the stone itself. In a surprising turnaround from inherited priorities, it was sometimes the outline of the stone rather than the standard motif pool that inspired the design (Fig. 7). Strangely this innovative studio did not extend to Newgrange, where most of the exposed kerbstones are decorated in a traditional style. When the new style appears at Newgrange, on the entrance stone for example, it was already fully worked out. As if to Page 19</page><page sequence="2">warn against seeing the Boyne tradition as a seamless garment, the use of spirals and lozenges to build up the design on this stone is characteristic of Newgrange rather than Knowth. Influence from overseas The creative surge that occurred at Knowth specifically may have been fed in part by new international influences. Designs borrowed almost unaltered from the late passage tomb tradition of Brittany were picked onto stones in the eastern and western tomb (Fig. 6). Their appearance at Knowth was part of a growing exchange of artistic ideas between the Irish Sea and the Continent. Strangely this international mix never percolated to Loughcrew, only 40km inland. Even within the Boyne Valley the influences were selective. The Breton themes seen in the Knowth art are not found in their pure form at Newgrange, which, remarkably, shows Iberian influences. The 'face' on orthostat LI9 (Fig. 5), strategically placed along the passage at Newgrange, could be seen as a variation on the anthropomorphic schist plaques found in southern Spain and Portugal. The linear ornament borrowed from Brittany was soon generalised by the Knowth artist(s) into amorphous areas of picking which again appear in their most evolved form on the orthostats at Newgrange, where picking extends over large parts of the stones. This is a long way from the tight arrangements representing the best of the Breton influence. But the overseas links were not exclusively Continental. The Newgrange entrance stone has been claimed, with some justification, as the inspiration for a decorated stone found at Pierowall in Orkney. More convincingly, the famous macehead (Fig. 2) from the chamber of the eastern tomb at Knowth introduces a number of British themes, notably the form of the macehead and the representation of spectacle spirals. It is a moot point whether this macehead was decorated in Ireland or in Britain. Although previously thought to be a primary deposit at Knowth, it might now be linked to the subsequent Grooved Ware complex there. If so, it affords a tantalising chronology for the art. We already Left: Fig. 3?Roofstone over the right-hand recess at Newgrange. The attractive design, which is jammed into the structure and therefore had to be completed when the tomb was built, has been assembled from basic insular elements such as circles. Below: Fig. 4?Kerbstone 56 at Knowth 1. The design is attractive and the motifs are boldly represented but the artist is still thinking exclusively in two dimensions. This arrangement, possibly the most aesthetically pleasing along the Knowth kerb, faces directly across to site 4. This tomb is unusual amongst satellites in that it contained a highly decorated sillstone. i' i ' tow -..' $\ ..3???&amp; know that some stones were decorated no later than the time the tombs were constructed, possibly around 3000 BC. Art continued to accumulate on many stones afterwards, and now we might suggest that one branch of the ornamental tradition was current in an evolved form at the Grooved Ware stage, several hundred years later. While the evidence remains unreliable, this suggests that the art tradition in the Boyne Valley may have continued over a period of several centuries. Meaning It has been claimed that the motifs common to megalithic art throughout western Europe are those that arise today during altered states of consciousness, whether drug-induced, naturally occurring or brought on by some activity like the frenetic dancing of a shaman. This suggests that the earliest megalithic art in Ireland may be an expression of such experiences. Why the motifs were applied on the tombs specifically is another issue. The cup mark, essentially a picked hollow, may hold one key to the problem. This motif often occurs in passage tombs that have no formal art; it also occurs frequently in rock art, and its genesis lies back in the Palaeolithic. It has been interpreted as a tunnel image, a deep-rooted symbol of death in the human psyche. At Newgrange the cup mark has been recorded on nearly one out of every two decorated kerbstones. In contrast, only one of every nine decorated stones within the tomb carries a cup mark. At Knowth the cup mark is Page 20</page><page sequence="3">Fig.5?Orthostat L19 at Newgrange. This too may be an anthropomorphic image, but here it is rep resented using insular motifs. Notice the unusual care taken by the later artist who applied the pick-dressing around rather than over it. found on about 20% of the 90 decorated kerbstones, but only on 6% of the 126 decorated stones in the eastern tomb and 5% of the 100 decorated stones in the western tomb. This differentiation indicates that it had a meaning related to the tomb itself. It may be that other motifs, too, were linked in the Stone Age with concerns about life, death and beyond. Why they gave way, in the Boyne Valley, to a different tradition of rambling lines and amorphous picking is one crucial enigma of Irish passage tomb art. In the Boyne area some of the decoration was carefully placed in designated parts of the passage tomb structures as if it carried special meaning in that context.

The importance of quartz is well known. So too are the solar alignments. Other symbolic themes are remarkably subtle. At Balnuaran of Clava in Scotland, for example, Professor Richard Bradley from the University of Reading has observed that the rear wall of the passage tomb, which would have been illuminated by the midwinter setting sun, includes a surprising proportion of dark red slabs. At Knockroe, Co. Kilkenny, a pink sandstone plays a key symbolic role within the western tomb. It may be that our preoccupation with the art has deflected our attention from the broader range of passage tomb imagery that might enrich our appreciation of the applied ornament. Otherwise the limitations of our own observations, if not our life experience, may cause us to underestimate the past. O Page 21</page></plain_text>
