This stems from either a theological bias, a feeling of superiority for one's own tradition and culture, or from preconceived notions possibly in the subconscious, perhaps without realizing either the actuality or implications of these notions. The comparative method employed in this field often yields highly subjective conclusions, which are, in many cases, more an indicative of the researcher's background and assumptions then anything else. In fact, the same set of data could be used by two different individuals who, using a different set of assumptions, might arrive at conflicting conclusions. This is not to underrate the relative value of the comparative method. For the study of a religious system in isolation also reduces the possibility of understanding it in depth. Hence, there is a need to define an approach that will be realistic and will help us comprehend the various religious traditions. Before embarking on this study it would be pertinent to mention at this stage that this writer is an outsider to the ancient Egyptian religions and the Judaeo Christian tradition. Hence, to look at both the Hymn to Aton and the Psalms 1 Sir James Gorge Frazer, The Golden Bough , 12 vols.

It would also be pertient to mention that this study is based on a careful reading of the Hymn2 and the Psalms in their translations rather than in their original languages. In the light of these facts, the writer does not expect this survey and analysis to be exhaustive nor definitive. Despite these limitations, we feel that we have arrived at important conclusions which have a bearing on any further study on the subject and which might be of interest to the lay readers, and hopefully also to the specialists of religious studies. The Problem of Similarities Since we intend to compare the intellectual expressions of two religious, traditions, an epistemological approach would seem appropriate. In the modern religious context, we could talk of the numinous experience as the source of all cognitive expressions that lead to the truth. Or in an anthropological sense, we could look at the expression of the numinous as a reflection of the human experience. In other words, such an epistemological exposition could lead us either to a divine or to a human source for the expression of ideas that lead to the numinous. Were we to attribute a divine source to both the texts in question, the problem of similarities in the two different religious traditions would be reduced to a theological understanding of the One Being Who reveals Himself to His creation time and again in a more or less similar fashion. Therefore, if there are similarities, that would signify the fact that the source of these expressions is the same Divine Being. This essentially leads us to the unity of all divine expressions. On the other hand, a theological bias could undermine the richness of the religious expression of at least one of the two traditions in question, namely Atonism, where there is no recorded evidence of such a process of revelation from the Divine Being. Most theological expressions are within the human rather than the divine realm. Thus, such an assumption would imply a superiority of one religion over the other. We would like to avoid this value judgment as much as possible. In case we were to change our starting point, we 2 Among others, translations of the Hymn to Aton can be found in James Henry Breasted, A History of Egypt from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest (London: C.

If so, then that elevates the question to the knowledge derived from the similarities among the deities of the ancient Near Eastern religions. The second approach, which assumes that all knowledge is derived from human experience, leads us to another problem. In this case, the similarities could be explained by identifying the contacts between the two cultures. These, as Frankfort suggests, could be of two types: "those due to a prehistoric diffusion of culture - at best a hypothesis - and those due to conquest, trade, or other contacts".3 Another possibility would be an independent development of similar thought that is universal and primordial which Frazer speaks of as "the essential similarity ... among all races ... which corresponds to the essential similarity of their bodily frame*.4 On the other hand, as Frankfort points out, the Frazerian approach of 'essential similarity' led him to conclude that "motives have operated widely, perhaps universally, in human society, producing in varied circumstances a variety of institutions specifically different but generically alike".5 This leads to a two-fold source of error that "differences are ... subordinated to similarities (and) the similarities ... are given undue weight as reflections of an original unity".6 This further led others to claim that "one definite pattern underlies most or all religions, or at least ... the religions of the ancient Near East".7 The use of 'pattern' here is not in the context of the morphology of a culture which distinguishes one Near Eastern civilization from another, but in the sense of "a fixed combination of certain elements which are expected to occur and which are, consequently, postulated even when they have left no trace in our evidence".8 Here it might be relevant to mention another approach, namely the phenomenological, which would undermine the basic question we have asked about the epistemological sources. In fact, using this approach, we could ask: is it valid and meaningful to explore the question of similarities on the basis of comparison at all? The interest would then shift from any possible 'influence' of one tradition on the other and of general 'patterns' among them to an attempt to understand the religious traditions under discussion.

The actual comparison between the Hymn to Aton (or Aten) and Psalm 104, though of interest to a theologian or a historian has little meaning for a student of religion. Besides, regardless of the source, it is our contention that the form of praise of the deity as embodied in the two texts can be classified as an 'essential similarity' in any religious tradition that tends towards monotheism. We need not talk of the 'influences' permeating through the length and breadth of these traditions, but should look at the similarities as the outcome of a common or similar experience, or of a common source of expression. Although we are inclined to this last approach, we must embark upon a comparison of the two texts as already undertaken by us with the hope that the conclusions will reflect the futility of such projects of comparative study of texts belonging to different traditions in furthering the understanding of religions. After these introductory remarks, we embark on a careful study of the Hymn and the Psalm. The Hymn to Aton The Pharaonic civilization in Egypt is known to have lasted for more than two and a half millennia from around 2925 bc to Alexander's invasion in 332 bc. There were 30 dynasties that ruled Egypt during this period as evident from the archeological and historical records. During this long period the religions and cults of the Egyptians saw various changes. The Eighteenth Dynasty (1539 - 1292 Be) was the beginning of the 'New Kingdom' era and a period of glory for Egypt. The kings of this dynasty conquered large parts of Africa and the Near East. Much of Syria and Palestine also remained under their control. The spoils of war enriched Egypt, and the massive construction of temples, palaces, tombs and cities took place during the reign of this dynasty. Amun-Re was the chief god of this period. Amun, who was the god of Thebes in the previous periods, was combined with the sun god Re and granted supremacy over all other gods. In fact, Amun had transformed from being a variant of the ithyphallic god Min of Koptos, to become a powerful sun god. The king or the pharaoh was Amun-Re's representative and a god. The worship of Amun-Re was challenged and a monotheistic religious revolution took place in Egypt towards the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty during the reign of Amenhotep IV (1353-1336 bc). This pharaoh renamed himself as Akhenaton or Ikhnaton during his fifth regnal year. Akhenaton himself led this change in the religion of the land. He tried to bring a</page><page sequence="5">THE PROBLEM OF SIMILARITIES IN ANCIENT NEAR EASTERN RELIGIONS 71 monotheistic revolution in the religious thought of Egypt by introducing the sole worship of Aton, the sun-disc. His new name Akhenaton (meaning "one useful to Aton") reflected this change, and he declared himself to be the "high priest of the sun god". The cult of Amun-Re and of other gods was suspended, and the worship of the sole god Aton was ordained. Unlike Amun-Re, the new sole god Aton was not depicted in anthropomorphic forms. All other previous gods were persecuted and in many places the word "gods" was expunged. There was a total break with the past. Akhenaton also moved his capital to a newly built city called Akhetaton at al-Amarna. His reign is often referred to in history as the Amarna period. Recent scholarship has argued that Atonism in fact stood for monolatry rather than monotheism.9 They point out that Akhenaton considered himself to be the physical son of Aton, and the common folk were required to worship him. He alone had the right to worship Aton. There are many examples given of different individuals praying to Akhenaton and not to Aton. It was during this period that Akhenaton composed the famous Hymn in praise of Aton. As Blackman and others have pointed out, similar hymns in the praise of the god Amun-Re were composed in the generations preceding Akhenaton and also after him.10 This hymn is preserved in its entirety in a tomb at al-Amarna, and it is the fullest statement of the faith of Atonism. After Akhenaton's death, Atonism came to be regarded as a heresy. The worship of the old gods, especially Amun-Re, was re-instituted by the boy pharaoh Tutankhamun, (r. 1332-1323 bc) who followed him. Akhetaton, the city built by Akhenaton, was also abandoned. It is very difficult to provide dates to the slavery period of the Israelites in Egypt. Many scholars believe that the Exodus took place within a generation or two of Akhenaton and the rise of Atonism. If this were true, then the Israelites would have probably been slaves in Egypt also during his period. However, Atonism was a royal religion, and never got filtered down to the masses.^This is why it was reversed so easily during the generation following Akhenaton's death. Due to this reason, there is a general feeling that Atonism may not have had any lasting effect on other religions of the region including the beliefs of the Israelites. 9 For a good discussion on this subject see, John A. Wilson, The Culture of Ancient Egypt (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1971), 224-29. 10 Aylward M. Blackman, ttThe Psalms in the Light of Egyptian Research" in D.C. Simpson, ed., The Psalmists (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1926), 179-197.</page><page sequence="6">72 KAZI ZULKADER SIDDIQUI Psalm 104 The "Book of Psalms" in the Old Testament of the Bible is a group of 150 religious poems. In general usage, these poems are referred to as the Psalms of David. Thus, if a remnant of the Book of Tjibiir given to David or Dawud is extant, then the Book of Psalms may contain it. King David is supposed to have ruled over the kingdom of Israel from 1000 - 961 BC. Thus, he ruled over Palestine about 350 years after Akhenaton. The unified kingdom of Israel was at that time split into two kingdoms - Israel and Judah - after the reign of Solomon in 922 BC. The northern kingdom of Israel ceased to exist after 722 BC when the Assyrians invaded it and took the entire population into captivity. In 597 BC, the southern kingdom of Judah was conquered by the Babylonians, and the Jews were exiled to Babylon. This "Exile" lasted from 597 to 538 BC. The period before 597 BC is referred to as pre-Exilic, and the period after 538 BC is referred to as post-Exilic. Biblical scholars are of the view that many of the psalms in the Bible were taken from earlier civilizations like the Canaanites. Thus, the origin of some of these poems could go back to times before Moses, i.e. around 1400 BC, or around 400 years before David. However, most scholars believe that the Psalms as they exist today were composed after the fifth century BC, or approximately 500-600 years after David. The earliest recorded date of the existence of the Psalms as a part of the kethubim (the sacred writings) was in 130 BC when Ben Sira's grandson alludes to them in the Prologue of Ecclesiasticus.11 The final canonization of the Psalter took place in the last decade of the first century after the Christ at the Synod of Jamnia in Palestine, more than a thousand years after David.12 Thus, although exact dates of authorship or the authors are unknown, it is clear that the authors lived centuries after David. Psalm 104 is dated differently by the scholars who consider it to be post Exilic. Regardless of the actual date and the author who is unknown, we know that it was composed at least half a millennium to a millennium after the composition of the Hymn to Aton. Comparison of the Two Texts These facts and the comparisons of the texts have led scholars to argue whether there was an indirect Egyptian influence or a direct borrowing. 11 G.W. Anderson, "Canonical and Non-Canonical" in P.R. Ackroyd and C.F. Evans, eds., The Cambridge History of the Bible (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970), 129. 12 Ibid., 133.</page><page sequence="7">THE PROBLEM OF SIMILARITIES IN ANCIENT NEAR EASTERN RELIGIONS 73 Whereas Breasted, Weigall and others13 have championed the latter position, the former viewpoint is represented by Nagel, Gressmann, Blackman and others.14 The moderates maintain that ait would be more prudent to envisage an indirect Egyptian influence through Canaanite mediation, more specifically through Phonecian intervention".15 This is based on the fact that the Phonecians had commercial and cultural contact with Egypt. Let us now turn to the texts and try to see whether a 'remarkable* similarity does indeed exist as most scholars suggest. We have placed the passages of the two texts16 side by side according to the opinions of various scholars in order to consider and verify their claims or to reject them. Of the many scholars who have pointed out the similarities, there only seems to be a parallel in the opening lines of both the texts. Humn toAton Universal Splendour and Power of Aton17 Thou dawnest beautifully in the horizon of the sky, O living Aton who wast the Beginning of life!

Thou art Re, and thou penetratest to the very end of them; Thou bindest them for thy beloved son (the Pharaoh). Though thou art far away, thy rays are upon earth; Though thou art in the faces of men, thy footsteps are unseen. 4 Who makest the winds thy messengers, fire and flame thy ministers. 5 Thou didst set the earth on its foundations, so that it should never be shaken. 6 Thou didst cover it with the deep as with a garment, the waters stood above the mountains. 7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the sound of thy thunder they took to flight. 8 The mountains rose, the valleys sank down, to the place which thou didst appoint for them. 9 Thou didst set a bound which they should not pass, so that they might not again cover the earth. Oesterley feels that verses 1-5 of the Psalm are adapted from athe ascription of praise to the Sun, and applied ... to the God of Israel".18 As discussed earlier, such 'essential similarities' of praise are typical of any monotheistic tradition. The existence of a similar idea is not proof enough for the 'adaptation theory'. It is obvious from a general reading of the two passages that although both passages praise the God, there is very little similarity in the texts % themselves. Besides, the "obvious allusion to the Creation"19 in verses 6-9 that Oesterley sees as comparable to the Egyptian hymn is not quite obvious to us. Without showing the direct comparisons,20 Oesterley makes a sweeping statement that lines 11-46 of the hymn are parallel to verses 10-26 of the Psalm. The parallels drawn by other scholars can be commented on with greater clarity. A number of scholars feel that there is a close parallel between the following lines of the hymn and either Ps. 104:19-2121 or Ps. 104:20-21.22 18 W.O.E.

Darkness broods, The world is in silence, He that made them resteth in his horizon. 19 20 21 Psalm 104 Thou hast made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows its time for setting. Thou makest darkness, and it is night, when all the beasts of the forest creep forth. The young Hons roar for their prey, seeking their food from God. The common terminology is the setting of the sun leading to darkness, serpents or beasts of the forest, and lions. The context of each, however, is totally different. The understanding of the natural phenomena described in the two texts is markedly different. The disappearance of Aton (sun-disc) in the western horizon is compared to death in the hymn. All living beings come to a standstill. On the other hand, the setting of the sun is just a reflection of the power and determination of Yahweh in the Psalm. It is He who made the moon to mark the seasons and it is He who causes darkness by making the sunset. The mention of the Hons follows the theme in each case. The similarity of the three words or phrases is reduced to insignificance in face of the fundamental differences of the theological framework of a God (Aton) causing Wcigall, The Life and Times of Akhenaten, 155; R.

The following comparison, as seen by many scholars23 goes further in endorsing our understanding. Hymn to Aton Day and Man 25 Bright is the earth when thou risest in the horizon; When thou shinest as Aton by day Thou drivest away the darkness. When thou sendest forth thy rays, The two lands (Egypt) are in daily festivity. 30 Men waken and stand upon their feet When thou hast raised them up. Their limbs bathed, they take their clothing, Their arms uplifted in adoration to thy dawning. Then in all the world they do their work. 22 Psalm 104 When the sun rises, they get them away, and He down in their dens; 23 Man goes forth to his work and to his labour until the evening. The only common terms here are the rising of the sun and men working in daytime. The intellectual expression of the cycle of the day that is reflective of the cycle as a metaphor as well as reality is markedly different from the psalmist's understanding of the existence of these phenomena as a reflection of Yahweh's will. The common terms are strewn through the passages. It becomes far more meaningful though, to penetrate the depths of the hymn 23 James Henry Breasted, The History of Egypt from Ancient Times to the Persian Conquest, 372; Idem., The Dawn of Conscience, 282; Elmer A.

The difference in analysis among the three scholars Williams, Blackman and WeigalF of the following lines is indeed remarkable. It demonstrates how different scholar correlate the same passage of the Hymn with totally different verses of the psalm. Hymn to Aton Day and the Animals and Plants 35 All cattle rest upon their pasturage, The trees and the plants flourish, The birds flutter in their marshes, Their wings uplifted in adoration to thee. All the antelopes dance upon their feet, 40 All creatures that fly or alight, They live when thou hast shone upon them._ Psalm 104 10 Thou makest springs gush forth in valleys; they flow between the hills, 11 They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst. 12 By them the birds of the air have their habitation; they sing among the branches. 13 From thy lofty abode thou waterest the mountains; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy work, 14 Thou dost cause the grass to grow for the cattle, and plants for man to cultivate, that 24 Giving his definition of the mythopoeic framework, Frankfort states: "Myth is a form of poetry which transcends poetry in that it proclaims a truth; a form of reasoning that transcends reasoning in that it wants to bring about the truth it proclaims; a form of action, of ritual behaviour, which does not find its fulfillment in the act but must proclaim and elaborate a poetic form of truth*. [Henri Frankfort, Before Philosophy (UK: Penguin, 1972), 16]. There is a major difference between ancient and modern man in terms of their perceptions of natural phenomena. The ancient man confronted a living 'thou* in nature. Thus, all happenings and events take the form of stories. Rather than giving logical analyses and conclusions, the ancient man converted his experiences into myths. Such mythical beings and stories would explain the different phenomena in nature. Thus, in Frankfort's words, "Myth then is to be taken seriously, because it reveals a significant, if unverifiable, truth?we might say a metaphysical truth. But myth has not the universality and the lucidity of a theoretical statement**. [Henri Frankfort, Before Philosophy, 15-16], The Egyptian frame of mind approximated this mythopoeic frame of mind, while the Psalm approximates the modern framework of institutionalized religion with a more scientific approach to nature. 25 R.J Williams, "The Hymn to Aten*\ 149 (compares 11. 35-41 to Ps. 104: 11-14); Aylward M.

The variant conclusions of the three scholars go to emphasize the need for paying greater attention to the varied structure of the texts. It is true that cattle, birds, trees and plants are among the creations of God mentioned in both texts, but the structural differences between the texts obviously outnumber the similarities. The conceptual differences are also significant. The hymn emphasizes the adoration and praise by the creatures of Aton, while the Psalm mentions them, among others, as a part of God's plan and His doings. The basic function of each is different. If there had been a borrowing, then the concepts should not have changed. Referring to verse 16 of this same text, Gressmann asserts his theory of Egyptian archetypal origin of this psalm filtered through the Lebanese soil. According to him, the cedars of Lebanon "were originally planted by Adonis, the Baal of Lebanon".26 Despite the popular trend among the scholars to show the parallels between the following verses,27 the lack of order, the differing magnitude of things described, and the different contexts speak for themselves. 26 Hugo Gressman, "The Development of Hebrew Psalmody", 19. 27 Jams Henry Breasted, The History of Egypt from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest, 373; Idem., The Dawn of Conscience, 283; Aylward M.

Gressmann reads a lot more between the lines and tries to show the influence of the hymn on the psalm further. He asserts that 'the great sea' mentioned in the psalm is the Nile and the Leviathan is the crocodile, which inhabits the Nile. In other words, the psalm is written in the Egyptian surrounding and all references are to the land of the Nile. With the exception of the two lines in the following which Blackman compares with Ps.145: 16, there are no parallels drawn.28 This particular comparison falls outside the scope of this paper.

Does this necessarily mean an import of one document from another? The answer is obviously in the negative. This is part of the 'essential similarity' that one finds in all the monotheistic religions of the world. The comparison of lines 74-77 with verse 27 is extremely misleading.31 The Hymn is concerned about providing food for man in a cosmological context of his environment and his destiny, while the psalm speaks of the Lord's provision of food for all creatures in due season. This underlies our basic postulation that one or two common words cannot justify generalizations. Hymn to Aton 66 While thou wast alone: Even men, all herds of cattle and the antelopes; All that are upon the earth, That go upon their feet; 70 They that are on high, That fly with their wings. The highland countries, Syria and Kush, and the land of Egypt; Thou settest every man into his place, 75 Thou suppliest their necessities, Every one has his food, And his days are reckoned. The tongues are divers in speech, Their forms likewise and their skins are distinguished, For thou makest different the strangers._ Psalm 104 27 These all look to thee, to give them their food in due season. 31 R.

But the Nile, it cometh from the Nether World for for the cattle, and plants for men to cultivate, The two views presented are that: lines 90-94 correspond to verses 6, 10 and 13 (Williams); and that lines 90-97 correspond to verses 13-14 (Weigall). If the first view were to be upheld, then the verses of the psalm should read in the order 13, 6, 10 to be able to make some sense and to be able to claim a parallelism. The ridiculousness of such a break up is obvious and needs no further comment. As for the latter, though more coherent structurally, it underlies a basic conceptual conflict. The fundamental difference in the perception of the cosmos among the two people can well be underlined by their cognitive grasp of the phenomenon of rain. The "Nile in the sky* and the "lofty abode" from which Yahweh waters the mountains very beautifully express the differences in the mental framework and the cognitive processes of each civilization. Each of the metaphors has a profound meaning in itself, which tends to be lost by pointing out the similarities and differences. The subtle 'mysterium' is convened into an argument over the grammar and rhetoric. We turn our attention now to another outrageous comparison. Hymn to Aton The Seasons Thy rays nourish every garden; 100 When thou risest they live, They grow by thee. Thou makest the seasons In order to make develop all that thou hast made. Winter to bring them coolness, 105 And heat that they may taste thee.

He compares verse 19 of the psalm with lines 102, 106 and 110 of the hymn. One wonders how the commentator could bring himself to twist and break up the lines and words to suit his whims. First, it needs to be pointed out just taking the three lines out of their context and grafting them in a different order destroys their meaning and the context. Secondly, the message conveyed by each is very different. The hymn talks of Aton making the seasons in order to promote fertility, and creating the sky for him to shine in. The psalm, on the other hand, mentions the moon which is made 'to mark the seasons' and the sun. setting according to its time. In other words, while the phenomena of the sun and moon are seen as defining the concept of time in the psalm, the hymn views the seasons in the context of fertility and the sun in its full glory reflecting the majesty of Aton. The vast difference in the cognitive perception totally eclipses the trivial similarity of the two words in a passage of 22 lines. Although one is tempted to accept the ideas in the following lines as similar, a closer look shows otherwise.34_ Hymn to Aton Universal Maintenance 126 The world subsists in thy hand, Even as thou hast made them. When thou hast risen they live, When thou settest they die; 130 For thou art length of life thyself, Men live through thee The eyes of men see beauty Until thou settest. Psalm 104 27 These all look to thee, to give them their food in due season. 28 When thou givest to them, they gather it up; when thou openest thy hand, they are filled with good things. 29 When thou hidest thy face, they are dismayed; when thou takest away their breath, they die and return to their dust. 30 When thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face of the ground._ 33 Arthur Weigall, The Psalms, 156. 34 Aylward M.

Leslie, The Psalms 181 and Arthur Weigall, The Life and Times of Akhenaten, 146.</page><page sequence="20">86 KAZI ZULKADER SIDDIQUI It is obvious that the underlying assumptions of the two texts are very different. The Egyptian hymn reflects the cosmological understanding of the cyclical nature of life corresponding to the rising of the sun and its setting. On the other hand, the concept, of subsistence of life as a result of Divine Providence and birth and death being a result of Divine will dominates the theme of the psalm. Finally, we would like to quote the concluding lines of the two texts. Hymn to Aton 135 All labour is put away When thou settest in the west. When thou risest again (Thou) makest (every hand) to flourish for the king And (prosperity) is in every foot, Since thou didst establish the world, 140 And raise them up for thy son, Who came forth from thy flesh, The king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Living in Truth, Lord of the Two Lands, Nefer-khepru-Re,Wan Re(Ikhnaton), Psalm 104 31 May the glory of the Lord endure for ever, may the Lord rejoice in his works, 32 who looks on the earth and it trembles, who touches the mountains and they smoke! 33 I will sing to the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have being. 34 May my meditation be pleasing to him, for I rejoice in the Lord. 35 Let sinners be consumed from the earth, and let the wicked be no more!

Although no scholar has compared the above passages, yet we have placed them next to each other to show how close we feel the parallels are indeed. If we want to, we can also make a good case for the 'adaptation theory* following Oesterley on the basis of the praise for the Lord and prosperity for the believer. It is a wonder that the similarity here did not strike any scholar. Conclusion Placing our discussion in perspective, we can point out a few salient points. We have noted that although certain terms and phenomena are mentioned in both the texts, the context and basic ideas contained in them are markedly different. Secondly, having kept the order of the lines of the Hymn to Aton, the corresponding order of the verses of the psalm (notwithstanding the numerous lines in the middle where there are no parallels), turns out to be as follows: 1-5, 6-9, 19-21, 22-23, 10-18, 25-26, (Ps. 145: 16), 24, 27, 6, 10, 13 14,19, 27-30,31-35. If the psalm were to be read in this order, not only would it change its meaning, it would make little sense. The fundamental differences that we have seen lead to at least one definite conclusion: that the direct influence of the Hymn on the Psalm must be discounted. One can argue, though, that these differences have arisen out of the changes undergone through the channel of the Phonecians, who acted as the via media. Thus, the most one can presume is an 'indirect influence* as the moderate scholars have suggested. This obviously assumes a human origin for both the texts and the concepts they put forward. In the end, we would like to contend that differences in religions do not necessarily obviate the anthropological unity of man or the unity of divine intervention in history. On the other hand, oversimplifications that ensue from a tendency to show similar patterns and influences tend to undermine the richness of a civilization and its system of values and institutions. They also basically rule out the idea of God's grand design for mankind through a unified process of revealing the same essential truths. Biblical scholars seem to have generally taken this attitude. Their value judgment, arising out of a superimposition of the norms of one civilization over another, distorts the true picture. At the same time, one cannot deny the 'essential similarities' that</page><page sequence="22">88 KAZI ZULKADER SIDDIQUI do permeate human thought in an essentially similar context. In this light, one needs far greater profoundness and circumspection in studying the two texts in the perspective of each religious tradition rather than seeking to identify similarities and patterns. ? ? ?</page></plain_text>
