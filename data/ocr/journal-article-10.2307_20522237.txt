<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LEIPREACHAN AND FAIRIES, DWARFS AND THE HOUSEHOLD FAMILIAR: A COMPARATIVE STUDY INTRODUCTION The leipreachan is a diminutive supernatural being of Irish folklore who is a shoemaker and possessor of great riches, for which he is often pursued, and who through his characteristic cleverness and trickery usually gets the better of interfering mortals. The local names by which he is known include geancanach (South Ulster and Leinster north of the Boyne), clutharacan (East Kerry-West Cork and Waterford-South Tipperary), gre'asaa' leipreacha'n (Galway and contiguous parts of Mayo and Clare), leipreachdn (known throughout the land but possibly belonging originally to Leinster and Con naught), 'lim(e)racawn' (= loimreachadn?, recorded in Rathvilly, Co. Carlow and in South Co. Dublin), lochramadn (Ulster and adjacent parts of neighbouring counties, and North-West Mayo), loiridz'n (recorded in Ballindine, Co. Mayo), lorgaddn (Central Munster from North Kerry to Callan, which is be yond the provincial boundary, in Co. Kilkenny), luacan (recorded in Doolin, Co. Clare), luzirici'n (North Wexford, and recorded in Edenderry, Co. Offaly), lzurachan (Kilkenny and South Wexford), lutharaca'n (Iveragh peninsula, Co. Kerry), lutharaddn (recorded in Doolin, Co. Clare) and lutharagan (Dingle peninsula, Co. Kerry).1 Though he is popularly associated with the fairies, the leipreachan seems to resemble the supernatural artisan dwarfs and household familiar of the folklore of various European countries much more closely. The principal aim of this paper, then, is to establish such a connexion, but since there has been no systematic study of the leipreacha'n based on the most important source-material - the archives of the Department of Irish Folklore - it has been decided to pub 1 See my 'An Leipreach?n san Ainmniocht' in B?aloideas (1982).

The salient features of the folk traditions have been discussed in depth, but the intent here, as with the discussion of the various theories of the origin of these supernatural beings, is to note as many plausible explana tions and points of view as possible - though many contradict each other - rather than to establish a fool-proof explanation. The comparative material is mostly from countries of Western Europe of Germanic or Romance tongue since no other material was readily accessible to the writer. I studied the archive material four or five years ago in order to write a thesis on the lezpreachan but only the main catalogue was used; however, supplementary to this, all the Schools' Manu scripts from Kerry (thanks to Seamas Mac Philib) and Galway were searched and some of those from Donegal and Mayo, and in addition, numerous references from other parts of the country were given to the writer by those who happened on them. Accounts from at least thirty of the thirty-two counties have been studied so that it can be claimed that this is a fairly representative sample, totalling more than three hundred manuscript references from the Folklore Archives or round about four hundred and fifty separate accounts - in all at a rough estimate, between a third and a half of the archive material on the leipreachan. THE LEIPREACHAN IN LITERATURE The word leipreachan derives from Old Irish luchorpadn, variously glossed as 'nanus', 'pigmeus' and so forth.2 In its earliest incidence, in the Saga of Fergus Mac Leti (derived from a poem dated to the middle of the 8th century; the story itself is in the mid-i Ith century Senchus Mor), the word seems to mean water-sprite, though Binchy doubts that this was its original meaning.3 Lebor na hUidre, the Book of the 2 M?ir?n O Daly and P. ?

Other early literary refer ences, noted in the Royal Irish Academy's dictionary, des cribe a line of luchorpain as descendants of the daughter of Cham (i.e. Ham), who conceived of a fish, and forming 'tu'atha atad a n-deiscert na hIndz'a .i. na lupracain 7 is i'ad is lugha do sa'l Adaim' [they are in the South of India and are the smallest of Adam's seed].6 In the 13th or 14th century account of the death of Fergus the lupracain have a kingdom of their own and except for their diminutive size seem little different from the people of Ulster with whom they come in to conflict. The lupracain of 'Aidedh Ferghusa' have a king dom of their own, great warriors, beautiful women, they pursue courtly pastimes and possess cattle and horses: their way of life, indeed, seems to be very much the same as that of Fergus' Ulster. Their small stature, rather than the super natural knowledge of Eisirt and Iubhdain, the latter's magical possessions or their mischief-making in order to force their king's release, causes most astonishment to the Ultonians.7 Excluding the narrowly lexicographical references that only supply an English equivalent to a leipreachadn word the first literary reference to the folk tradition is, to my knowl edge, in O'Reilly's Dictionary (1817), which has the follow ing entry: Leithbhra'gan . . . a pigmy sprite, supposed to be always employed at making or mending a single shoe, from leith, one, or half a pair; brog, a shoe, an, artifex: he was an emblem of industry.8 Crofton Croker (1824) describes the 'Cluricaune or Lepre 4 J.E.

He is 'a small and withered old man', a cobbler, the possessor of an inexhaustible purse, who is trapped by an unbroken stare and escapes by trickery.9 His book of the fol lowing year has two stories of the 'Cluricaune'. In the first, Naggeneen the Cluricaune - whose appearance is much as we would expect - haunts the wine cellar of Justin Mac Carthy of Ballinacarthy. When the two eventually meet the Cluricaune recalls Mac Carthy's earlier threat to leave: 'Sure, and master, a'n't we going to move to-morrow? and sure you would not leave your own little Cluricaune Naggeneen behind you?', which suggest the migratory legend 7020 (vain attempt to escape from the Nisse) of which Crofton Croker's second story is clearly a version; this deals with the Cluricaune, Wildbeam, who attaches himself to a Quaker family. 10 Thomas Keightley (1828) describes the 'Leprechaun' (with variants Logheryman, Cluricaun, Luricaun, Lurigadaun) much as Crofton Croker does but attributes to him treasure rather than a purse.11 Crofton Croker (1829) has another tale of a Cluricaune encountered sitting under a rock 'at the dead hour of the night' hammering on the heel of an old shoe; his assistance is requested and given.12 Samuel Lover (1834) gives a piece of doggerel, 'The Leprechaun and the Genius', which shows some familiarity with the folk tradition: a small, aged man is described, two feet tall, wearing a red, three-cocked hat with matching coat and a flapped vest, stitching a shoe and drinking poteen; he escapes through trickery.13 Amhlaoibh O Su'illeabhaiin's 9 T.

Though it seems to confuse them with the fairies insofar as it attributes a fairy ring to them, its descriptions of their appearance, their possession of a purse of gold and their ability to escape through a ruse (namely ventriloquism: 'is goile-labharthoir gach lurgadan') are faithful to folk tradi tion.14 Philip Dixon Hardy (1837) describes the tiny 'Leprawhauns' as the artisans ('the tailors, brogue-makers, smiths, and coach-builders etc.') of the fairies; they are usually seen in the evening in lonely spots during fine weather, 'are acquainted with all the hidden treasures of the earth' and escape their captors by distracting their gaze. He re counts a version of Type 503 'The Gifts of the Little People' in which the Leprawhaun is the agent.15 Mr and Mrs Hall (1843) quote Crofton Croker on the Cluricaune but also give some of their own observations: that he is 'one of the most archly mischievous and amusing of the fairy tribe', is a cobbler, 'seats himself astride a butt of the best wine in the cellar of a friend's house, and taps the juice of the grape for his own advantage', and has treasures con cealed in caves. The first of their stories has the Cluricaune - who 'if he has a respect for anything in the world, it is for an ancient family - as long as it keeps a good cellar' thwarting Oliver Cromwell in the house of his dispossessed master by turning wine into salt water. Another story tells of Knock the Cluricaune making the house of his former master uninhabitable through mischief and malice and thus expelling its new English occupant; the parson's assistance to the owner is in vain: he no sooner opens his book than Knock delivers the retort, 'Maybe I'm as well read in that as yer 14 Tom?s de Bhaldraithe, Cin Lae Amhlaoibh, Baile ?tha Cliath 1970,117. 15 Philip Dix on Hardy, Legends, Tales and Stories of Ireland, Dublin 1837, 219-32.

A version of the legend based on motif K415, 'Marked culprit marks everyone else and escapes detection' (in which the leipreacha'n multi plies the marker indicating the spot under which the crock of gold is buried), is also recorded here,Jack Cassidy's disappoint ment being mollified by the Cluricaune's acute observation: 'if you kept your thoughts as steadily fixed on your work as you have kept your eyes on me, you'd have money enough without hunting for Cluricaunes . . . a roving blade gathers no more goold than a rolling stone does moss,' which recalls a didactic legend in the folk tradition (infra).16 The following reference belongs to a letter written by Daiibhf Do Barra to a William Hackett of Midleton in 1844: It is feigned by the Irish that there are two dwarfs of the clutharacan tribe in Ireland called Toll Farcz'n and Bod a Ghiorta that blight the corn and prevent its gowth ... 16 a Could these be ficts?

Sir William Wilde (1852) gives a description of the 'lepre chaun' and mentions his being a cobbler, his 'adhaster buidhe (golden bridle, which whenever shaken, was found with the yellow steed attached to it)', his 'sporran-na-skillinge' and his elusiveness.17 Mrs Alfred Gatty (1862) tells of a boy's en counter with the little man, dressed in what we might now call typical fashion but holding a gold-headed cane in each 16 Mr and Mrs S.C.

It is said that "they would get your gold." They are very strong.20 'Loughry man' is an anglicization of lochramacn. D.R. McAnally's description (1888) of the Leprechawn seems reliable; he also emphasizes the role of household familiar a la Crofton Croker with the Leprechawn haunting the wine cellars of the 'rale owld shtock' and doing mischief such as riding the animals to the point of fatigue and throwing things around the house. 'By birth the Leprechaun is of low descent,' he writes, 'his father being an evil spirit and his mother a degenerate fairy.' 'The Logheryman,' he says, 'wears the uni form of some British infantry regiments ... and after doing some trick more than usually mischievous, his favourite posi tion is to poise himself on the extreme point of his hat, standing at the top of a wall or on a house, feet in the air, then laugh heartily and disappear.'21 Lady Wilde (1888) has two stories about the Leprehaun; one tells of the good for tune of a boy who captured him, the other of the evil con sequences of the Leprehaun's capture and ill-treatment.22 Patrick Kennedy (1891) has a story of a Lurikeen, who was observed sewing a shoe. 18 Mrs Alfred Gatty, 'Tales of the Fairies' in B?aloideas III, (1932), 369. 19 Lageniensis (John O'Hanlon), Irish Folklore, London 1870, 237-41. 20 William Hugh Patterson, MRIA, A Glossary of Words in Use in the Counties of Antrim and Down, London 1880, s.v.

His Leprecauns are shoe makers and owners of crocks of gold, dressed in green and wearing tall hats. That Stephens was familiar with Aidedh Ferghusa is evident in the last chapter where he makes refer ence to 'the people of the Lupra', to their king 'Udain Mac Audain' (Iubdan Mac Abdacin of Aidedh Ferghusa) and to his tanist 'Beg Mac Beg' (Bec mac Bic) and to other notables such as 'Glomhar O'Glomrach' (Glomhar mac Glaiss mic Glomraide), 'Conain Mac Rihid' (Conain mac Ruichid) and 'Gaerkui Mac Gairid' (Gerrchu mac Gairid).33 Before concluding this probably incomplete survey of literary references to the leipreacha'n it is well to recall that such references have not been lacking in newspapers, popular 24 Pp. 139,268. 25 P. 22. 26 P. 39. 27 Pp. 74-5. 28 Pp. 189-92. 29 Pp. 111-5. 30 P. 229. 31 In Denvir's Monthly Irish Library, No. 26 (1904), 27. 32 Golden Treasury Series, Poems by William Allingham, London 1912,47-50. 33 James Stephens, The Crock of Gold, Pan London 1973 edition p. 169 and O'Grady, op. cit., Irish Text, 238, Translation, 270.</page><page sequence="9">THE LEIPREACHAN: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 83 magazines (e.g. Ireland's Own), journals and - most likely - chap-books. That many of our primary sources (e.g. the IFC manuscripts) have been influenced by these - and other - publications stands to reason and indeed it has been pos sible to identify some of these offending accounts. Literary influence on folk tradition should not be underestimated: it is calculated that in the decade from 1781 to 1790 fifty-two per cent of the population of Ireland could read English and this proportion remained more or less unchanged until the second half of the following century.34 'A work published in 1818 estimates the number of books sold annually in Ireland at 300,000,' mostly chap-books,35 which means that on average one book was bought for every eleven literates. THE LEIPREACHAN IN FOLK NARRATIVE The manuscript references, from the Department of Irish Folklore's collection, are uneven in quality: one should con sider, for example, that details of some accounts in the Schools' Manuscripts may have been deliberately exaggerated by their narrators for the pleasure of the children who wrote them down; that some children, if not deliberate plagiarists,36 may have been influenced by some of the books of their school syllabus; that some adults may have invented stories for their youthful transcribers or simply re-told stories that they had read. In equal measure similar qualifications apply to a small part of the Main Manuscripts' Collection. 34 Caoimh?n ? Danachair, 'Oral Tradition and the Printed Word' in Irish University Review, vol. 9, No. 1, 36. 35 Loc. cit. 36 I(rish) F(olklore) C(ollection) S(chools manuscripts) 453, pp. 152-4, for example, is an obvious plagiarism from Kennedy's Legendary Fictions, 117; the setting is transferred from Edenderry to Gneeveguilla, Co. Kerry; IFC 321, 136-40, from Co. Mayo, derives from the same source. The leipreachdn is described as having a cruiskeen by his side in IFC S 622, 408-10, IFC S 915; 199-201, and IFC S 1079: 213-5; this detail derives from a poem in P?draic Colum's A Treasury of Irish Folk lore, 608 in the New York 1954 edition.</page><page sequence="10">84 DIARMUID 0 GIOLLAIN Another important reservation concerns the method of transcription of accounts. We cannot fault the text of a tape or ediphone recording, nor the verbatim recording of a seanchaz"s words in a note-book: these are the work of the trained field-collector. But the school collectors and many others tended to be abstractors: a legend may be recorded in the generalized form that C.W. von Sydow termed a dite, for example; worse, a belief or tradition recounted by one per son may be attributed to a community - in good faith. The result of these qualifications is that our references would differ greatly in value as material for a study of the former extent of folk belief in the leipreachacn.37 On the other hand accounts of the leipreachan - whether recorded by trained collectors or school-children, written in manuscripts or popular magazines - are remarkably homogeneous, lead ing one to the conclusion that though the form of the narra tion may be changed in transcription its substance shines faithfully through. A survey of the genres in the source accounts shows the type of generalized statement referred to earlier to be in the majority - particularly in the rather abstract accounts of the Schools' Manuscripts - but as has already been explained this form usually does not represent the words of any narrator, but rather their substance. A perusal of verbatim accounts indicates an unwillingness to generalize on the part of narrators so that a legend, or indeed a first-hand report, is much commoner than a dite. 38 The leipreacha'n appears regularly in at least two Mdrchen. They are Type 670, The Animal Languages; and Type 675, The Lazy Boy. At least four versions of 670 have the leipreacha'n, three from Galway (in which he is locked up in a box) and one from Kerry,39 'A mermaid ... takes the place of the leipreachan in most Irish examples of this tale.

There are at least three more or less stereotyped legends of the leipreachan. The commonest, of which at least twenty two versions are known, has taken form over much of Ireland and is recorded in the four provinces.42 Its basis is the motif K415 (marked culprit marks everyone else and escapes detection): This man caught the leipreachacn one morning near Clais a'Naylor and made close prisoner of him. There was no chance that he would get off until he told the man where the gold was. 'If you bring me out to the fort field I'll show you where the gold is.' The man brought him out and the fairy showed him a big buachaldn [ragwort]. 'Dig under this weed tomorrow morning and you'll get a crock of gold.' 'Wait,' says he, 'and we'll mark it.' 'Take off my right garter and tie it around the bua chaldn and you'll know where to dig in the morning.' The man did as he was told and let the little man go. 40 O'Sullivan, op. ai., 273. 41 Conchubhar ?

It has only been recorded once outside of Galway and of the Galway instances only once outside of the East of the county. 'It is said if you caught him and kept him in a tightly closed box for a year and a day, he would tell you where to find a pot of gold.'44 This seems to be the reason for his imprison ment, itself referred to in more than a dozen accounts. He uses his habitual repertory of tricks to escape. Four of these accounts deserve to be treated on their own as versions of a legend, of which the following is an example: About forty years ago a man was going to the bog for a bag of turf (. . .) As he came near the bog ... he saw a little man ... fixing a boot that would fit a baby about a month old (... .) When John saw the leipreacha'n he commenced to think what he would do. Next, how ever, he caught hold of the wee cobbler and took him home to his mother. They locked him up in a wooden box and piled stones on the lid. The leipreachan was crying inside of the box, "Can I go? Can I go? Can I go?" This cry, and roar, kept on for nine months. John's mother could listen to it no longer. One day, she said, "Go at once and let me hear this no more!" So the leipreacha'n went away as quickly as his legs could carry him.45 Usually the leipreachacn pesters his captors by calling 'Imeoidh me! Imeoidh me!' [I will go] and in one version the woman who has to bear the brunt of his psychological warfare finally explodes in exasperation, 'Imigh agus an diabhal leat!' [Go! And may the devil go with you!].46 This 43 IFC 407: 233. 44 IFC S 54: 190. 45 IFC S 29: 517-23. A version has been published in W.Y.

The loss of this feature might be attributed to the fact that school-children wrote the stories down.47 The third of these legends is didactic and is known from eight versions, scattered across the centre of Ireland with the exception of one from Kerry. Its curiousness, and the fact that six of its versions were written down by children while a seventh is in a similarly childish style, raises suspicions: perhaps it is a story from a school syllabus. The following is one of the versions: Once a man caught a leipreachan and asked him for his gold. After deceiving him for a time with vain excuses he told him it was beneath a certain oak tree. Without losing any time the man dug beneath the tree until he came upon a small grey box. He opened it and found a piece of paper within on which was written, 'work for money and you shall have plenty.'48 Traditions about the leipreachan are not really central to these legends; their narrative strength gives them a life of their own. Numerically most important are those less polished legends anchored firmly in the local folk-belief. More than one hundred and thirty of these have been encountered and they are the basis for many of the observations in the next section of this paper. Despite many variations, by and large these legends can be seen to issue from the one mould: 47 This legend also bears some resemblance to Type 670, sometimes known as the Three Laughs of the Leipreachdn: during his imprison ment in a box, the little man gives three mysterious laughs, which it later transpires are at the expense of his captor whose acts, as the leipreachdn's supernatural knowledge reveals, will be to his own dis advantage. See Walter Havernick, 'The Ghost in the Coffin' in Caoimhin ? Danachair, ed., Folk and Farm, Dublin 1976, 90-6 for an account of demons in little boxes which guarantee their owners success in financial transactions, and the connexion between this tradition and that of household familiar spirits. 48 IFC S 13: 112-13.

So the breaking of this interdiction on looking away puts the captor back in the same situation of lack where we first encounter him. The follow ing is a Cavan version: Years ago one of the old Xs [family name], of Dromore, saw a ganconna [geancadnach] making a pair of boots on the side of a hill. X stole up behind him and picked up one of the boots that the little fellow was after making. 'That's the nicest boot ever I looked at,' says X. 'There's a nicer one on the other side of you,' says the wee lad.

But he left his little cloak behind him and X brought it home and it was in the house for a long time.49 This, in translation, is a West Cork version: The clocharachacn makes shoes inside in a little rock cavern and he has sparan na scillinge: every time you'd look in the purse there would be a shilling there. You'd seldom see the clocharachacn and it is very dif ficult to catch him. A man heard that he was in some rock cavern or other. He came upon him one evening and gripped him firmly. 'Give me your purse!' said the man. 'Let me go,' said the clocharacha'n, 'and I'll give you the purse.' If you took your eye off him he'd get away from you. 'Get a red-hot spit,' said the clocharacha'n, 'and stick it in his backside!'

Fairy gift disappears or is turned to something worthless when tabu is broken). An equally small number of accounts tells of success in this endeavour. In Co. Cavan, 'the old people, in conversation, when they were after hearing of some man giving a big price for a farm or anything else, would say "He must have caught a gankunna." ,51 Vivid accounts that owe as much to personal experience as to collective tradition are von Sydow's memorates, which he describes as 'Erzdhlungen der Leute iiber ezgene, rein per sonliche Erlebnisse', narratives of the people about their per sonal experiences.52 There are memorates in which there are ample indivi dual, unique features and, in certain respects, "unneces sary" details . . . There are also those which, along with authentic experiences, contain motifs learned, for example, from legends. From the point of view of the analysis of supernatural experiences, the first group is most valuable. But from the point of view of folk belief, those which contain secondary alterations are also valuable.53 For convenience, we can place in the first group the eleven first-hand accounts, strikingly vivid in their narrative, rambling perhaps, but containing no details at variance with collective tradition. Two of the narrators are responsible for four of the accounts and at least four of the encounters took place when the narrators were children. These narratives are little more than sightings and consequently give scope for few traditions other than appearance and size of the leipreachdn and his mysterious disappearance; for example, only one nar rator described seeing - when he was a child - a lezpreachdn shoemaking. 51 IFC 832: 475. 52 Honko, op. di., 11. 53 Loc. cit.</page><page sequence="16">90 DIARMUID O GIOLLAIN Two of the memorates do not indicate the time of day the encounter occurred. Of those that do only one described broad daylight; another describes the lutharacacn being seen the moment the sun first appeared on a Spring morning; the sun shone on him. It is of interest that in half a dozen of these memorates the leipreachan has a shine on his clothes, which indicates, perhaps, that a glint of light on a dark night was the triggering device for many of these experiences (cf. F236.1.5. Fairies in gleaming clothes).

We went east then and we were coming up to the little bridge on the Bailin . . . - there is a big gully below the bridge there, between it and the sea - and the sun was just appearing. By gor, whatever look I gave I saw this thing rising up out of the gully and springing up on top of the rail of the bridge - yerrah! he was a paltry little thing, he wasn't a foot tall - and the sun was shining on him.

Between the two genres, though, are many transitional forms. THE LEiPREA CHAN IN FOLK BELIEF The leipreachan is always described as small, if not tiny, and this is often emphasized by vivid comparisons: 'only as big as your fist',56 hardly the height of the chair',57 'not much bigger than a traithnz'n',58 little more than the size of a year-old child59 and so forth. Many accounts give par ticular measurements; of these somewhat less than half des cribe him as being two feet or more in height and of the remainder half specify a height of from one to two feet and half specify less than a foot. He seems to observers to be old and wizened: 'it is said that he appears ... as a little old man with a wrinkled coun tenance;'60 'a little, oldish man'61 with a very wrinkled face'62 and a long grey beard63 (a characteristic). Though he may have been 'very small but appeared to be fully dev eloped,'64 several accounts give him an ungainly, grotesque, aspect: he is a very small person with a big head and big 55 IFC 928: 370-4.

They were - women and men - between six and eight feet tall and never did harm to anyone. The druids became jealous and by magic prevented the women from giving birth save once every thirty years and prevented both sexes from being more than two feet tall.

The Irish fairies were supposed to be the Fallen Angels in the popular belief;91 the leipreachan is traditionally identified with the fairies: 'the leipreachain is a little fairy man,'92 'the gancunnas were a class of fairies in themselves'93 and so forth; also worthy of note is the appellation 'fairy shoe maker', the significant accounts in which the leipreachan is referred to solely or synonymously as a fairy and his con sistent association with ring-forts and fairy trees. A characteristic feature of the leipreacha'n is his solitariness. Though several accounts exist of more than one encountered at a time it can safely be said that these are uncharacteristic; indeed, frequently in these cases it is obvious that leipreachadin and fairies have been confused. 'N'fheaca einne riamh dha' leipreachan in eineacht,' it is stated unequivocally, 'pe ait go mbionn se bionn se ma aonar i gconal'94 [two are never seen together]. This contrasts sharply with the fairies who 'led a community life, having their own local rulers'95 and some of the collective names used to refer to them bear this out. The leipreachadn's most common place of residence is in or about ring-forts, colour being added to the accounts by details such as 'he lives under a whitethorn bush in a lisz'n , '96 90 IFC 1039: 201-6. 91 Sean ?

If one examines these accounts according to where he works the order is as follows: trees, bushes or woods, mushrooms, rocks, crevices or caves, fields and gardens - sheltered places being commonest. Little importance is attached to the time of day or year when the leipreachan is seen. One account states emphatically that he is never seen during the day;113 according to another 'by chance you may see him before sunrise in the morning'.114 Overall, he is most commonly encountered at night, morning 97 IFC S 18: 197-204. 98 IFC S 88: 43-4. 99 IFC S 833: 237. 100 Ibid., 236. 101 IFC S 452: 251. 102 IFC S 833: 236. 103 IFC 1041: 202-4. 104 IFC S 235: 72-7. 105 E.g.

References to this crock or pot of gold are very numerous: 'if you got a hold of one of them [a 'gancunna']and held him tight, and if you threatened that you were going to kill him, he'd tell you where there was a "kishka" [ciste] - a crock of gold;'118 in addition are mentioned a pot of silver, a pot of money, a jug of gold and a barrel of gold."19 The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow does not usually seem to be associ ated with the leipreachan.120 More interesting, as regards distribution at any rate, is the leipreacha'n's purse: Deireann na seandaoine go bhfuil sparan ag an leip reachain agus e lain d'airgead i gconai.

A handful of accounts describe a penny purse - sparan na pingine - or a purse in which a half-crown is always to be found, all from Kerry. The leipreachan [according to a Kerry account] has two purses, one full of gold, and another full of penny leaves. He will offer you the one full of penny-leaves first, and if you say he has another one, he will give you the right one.'122 There is a couple of dozen accounts of purses of gold, or of money, and of bags of gold. Besides pot and purse are numerous references to the leipreachan's possession of gold in particular and also of money or silver (airgead). Sometimes 'he possesses a knowledge of hidden treasures but does not disclose their whereabouts till he is pressed to the utmost'.123 'It is said that he has the knowledge of where the fairies' gold is hidden .. .'124 'It is supposed that he knew where all the gold and treasure of the country were hidden. He could bring you and point out where there was gold at any time.91N One account attributes the hiding of the treasure to the Vikings.'26 Several accounts state that the leipreachdn guards the treasure. Regional names, such asgreasaz leipreachan, and occasional names, such as 'fairy cobbler,' 'fairy shoemaker' and greasai' na siog, leave little doubt about the preferred occupation of the leipreachan: "Se a dheineann na broga go leir don crowd a bhionn ins na leasaibh agus duinta agus fortanna,"'27 [he makes shoes for the inhabitants of the forts] . He is identified as a shoemaker in a hundred or so accounts, of which some what less than a quarter specify his clientele to be the fairies, 122 IFC S 440: 509-11. 123 IFC S 956: 275-6. 124 IFC S 440: 507. 125 IFC 922: 428-9. 126 IFC 451: 71-8. 127 IFC 393: 181.</page><page sequence="24">98 DIARMUID O GIOLLAIN whose shoes he makes and repairs; the afore-mentioned names for the leipreachan and the unsatisfactoriness of any references which might suggest that he works for mortals ('it was told that the Leprehauns used to make the shoes better than any earthly cobbler and that they used only charge a very small price for doing so.')128 should leave no doubts, however, about this clientele. One account informs us: 'bhiodh cuid acu ina ngreasaithe'"29 (some were shoemakers) but does not state what their remainder did. Another says that besides cobbling and making music the lutharagan 'also makes pots of gold and hides them under flags in certain places.'130 The geancanach's 'usual occupation is shoemaking and minding a pot of gold'"3' according to another. There are two references to domestic sidelines: 'the leipreachans are supposed to be good knitters as well as shoemakers,'132 and 'it is said by the old people that their work is mending shoes and knitting stockings.' Shoemaking, however, is not the leipreachan's only re corded occupation, though references to all others number only six. In one of these he claims to be a goldsmith for the fairies though further on it is stated that he 'spends most of his time fixing shoes and making little boots.'134 Another leipreachan recounts that he was the only court musician to the king and queen of the fairies.135 A 'leppercon' tells an Antrim man that he was nearly five hunner' years roun' this place, that he had been always looking after the farmers' places for them when they were sleepin' at night, and that some o' them had been good to him, and would 'a' done wee kindnesses to him like giving him an oul' shirt or a pair of breeks or an oul' hat.'136 128 IFC 555: 181-96. 129 IFC S 1079: 209-10. 130 IFC S 88: 43-4. 131 IFC S 724: 343-4. 132 IFC S 440: 509-11. 133 IFC S 452: 251. 134 IFC S 455: 71-3. 135 IFC 253: 1009-18. 136 IFC 1102: 97-114.</page><page sequence="25">THE LEIPREACHAN: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 99 This is not the only resemblance to the household familiar tradition.

Once you saw him you had to keep your eyes on him and never take them off him for even the smallest frac tion of a second. Once you took your eyes off him he would disappear and you would never see him again. He would employ different kinds of subterfuges in order to get you to take your eyes off him for the fraction of a second. He would say 'mind yourself on that dog behind you! ' or 'look at the blood on your hand! ' or on your foot, or he would pretend that there was somebody near you and he would speak to them, and if you looked away at all he was gone. When you caught him you had to hold him in a firm grip and keep watching him all the time. And even while you were holding him he would endeavour to attract your attention to something else, and if you looked away from him he would disappear out of your hands. When all these devices failed he would start begging and craving of you to let him go. He would tell you that he had no money and that he had no crock of gold concealed.146 A pertinent question is whether the leipreachdn is seen to be of a benign or of a malevolent nature. A dozen accounts testify that he is a friendly being, with qualification in a quar ter of these: they are 'very friendly unless you touch them; then they will let out revenge on you.'147 This revenge motif occurs independently in nearly two dozen accounts as the consequence of people interfering in some way with the leipreachan. In addition is a couple of accounts in which a threat from the leipreachadn intimidates his adversary into desisting. 145 This word is often used synonymously with leipreach?n and its variants. 146 IFC 832: 475-9. 147 IFC S 88: 43^.</page><page sequence="27">THE LEIPREACHAN: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 101 Eleven accounts describe people's fear of him, which may or may not be connected with the following belief, recorded only once: 'tai se raiite einne a cheonn e na' maireann se aon fhaid' (anyone who sees him does not live long) to which the narrator adds, 'agus 'on diabhal nuair a chonac fein e... cheapas go raibh mo bhalcaisi buailte!' (when I saw him my self I thought my time was up!)148 Several accounts tell of petty misdemeanours of the leipreachan such as stealing or annoying people for no good reason. A South Kerry account depicts a lutharcan as a voyeur, sitting under the table to watch a woman undressing beside the hearth; she dies of fear and shame on noticing him.149 A few accounts state un equivocally that he is unfriendly, a few more that he does not help people; on the other hand more than a dozen state that he helps people with gifts of some kind, out of the goodness of his heart, sometimes with the common motif of the pre condition that no-one be told (F348.7).

He is also foster-son of Manannan Mac Lir, and a Druid of the Tuatha de Danann.'16 Oa The German dwarfs tend to be misshapen and ugly with immoderately large heads and unnaturally pale wrinkled faces. Their big, sunken, glowing eyes are often red and cannot tolerate the daylight. Their noses and ears are ill-shaped and inordinately large, their mouths broad and thick. They have grey or white beards, often long and flowing. Their hair is strong and unruly. Their thin hands are cold and soft, often black in colour and their feet are flat, bent and stunted, caus ing the dwarfs' ungainly carriage; sometimes they have only one leg.'6' 156 Ibid., s.v.

He looks like a wrinkled old man.162 The brownies are described as 'small men. . . with brown faces and shaggy heads';163 the Spriggans of Cornwall, who resemble dwarfs, are 'usually very small and grotesquely ugly'. 164 The Galician trasno is described as a long-bearded, good-natured dwarf of human form.165 The trasgu of Santander and Asturias is a little black man with green or brilliant eyes who is lame in the right leg.

The Bergmdnnchen, mining dwarfs, dress like miners. Other dwarfs may dress in antiquated peasant costume, in gaily coloured dress, and so forth.

In the South of Spain the duende appears dressed as a friar, as he does in the literature of the last couple of hundred years of which Calderon's La Dama Duende provides a most entertaining example; Cosme is asked to describe the duende he claims to have seen: Era un fraile/Tamafiito, y tenia puesto/un cucurucho tamafo ;/Que p or e stas sefias creo/Que era duende capuchino.185 [The Capuchins are the friars with the longest hoods.] The household familiar usually wears 'a jaunty little cap' accord ing to Funk and Wagnall.186 The belief that the dwarfs were the Fallen Angels was al ready known in Germany in the Middle Ages.

The Kobold is often represented as male or sexless though some times in Northern Germany it is female under circumstances which indicate an original forest or water spirit.197 The dwarfs live preferentially in mountain caves. Their underground passages often cover long distances, go under rivers such as the Rhine, and emerge in a farmhouse kitchen or in a monastery or whatever. Where mining is or was car ried on they may live in the hollows of the pits or in the abandoned mine.198 Knockers are dwarf-like spirits who live in the Cornish mines and also in rocks, caves and wells.'99 The spriggans 'are only to be seen about old ruins, barrows, giants' quoits and castles, and other places where treasure is buried, of which they have the charge.'200 The korrigans live in rocks and caverns.201 In other parts of France there are similar traditions of cave-dwelling dwarfs, jetins, petits hommes, fadets, lutons, and so forth.202 The Kobold, brownie, boggart, trasno, trasgo, duende, mazzariol and a host of similar beings live in or around human dwellings as befits their household familiar role.

According to old Germanic tradition they are skilled gold- and silversmiths. They are also proficient blacksmiths and make and repair tools for men. As potters, tailors and shoemakers they are equally dexterous: a worn shoe left outside the dwarfs' cave at night with appropriate payment is repaired by morning. Some dwarfs are miners.

These include shape-shifting, prophecy, knowledge of hidden properties of plants and minerals, healing and causing illness (Zwergenschlag, Alpschoss -cf. 'fairy stroke,'poc si), invisibility and superhuman strength (the last two deriving from the dwarfs' Nebelkappe).214 The Kobold is also a shape-shifter, a giver of good counsel, a fore teller of death, a weather-prophet.215 Shape-shifting is also known to the spriggans.216 The trasno can present himself in the form of different animals,217 as can the trasgo.218 The mazzaro't di bosc, of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, is 'un omino vestito di rosso che si trasforma in gigante, gomitolo, ciuco'.2"9 The lutins of the Northern Ardeche often change into lambs.220 Although the dwarfs are known to steal food from men much of their relations with humans are of a more positive nature. Friendly relations often develop. They borrow and lend, give gifts, help the needy and bring good luck to some. The help they give includes spinning flax, washing up, sweep ing, threshing, grinding and so forth - work carried on in or about the house, which suggests an overlap with the tradi tion of the household familiar. They are also fond of making mischief, favourite tricks including plaiting the horses' manes, teasing the livestock and tormenting idle servants. A more inauspicious aspect of their relations with men is their revenge, which can take the form of landslides, avalanches, thunderstorms, general ill-luck and death.221 213 S?billot, op. cit., Vol. I, 459.

DISCUSSION 1 "The belief in 'small beings ... who play all manner of pranks 'is widespread through northern Europe, and the Wolof of Africa believe in beings peculiarly similar to the lepre chaun.'237 The leipreachan, household familiar and dwarf are all diminutive beings and there is also a tradition of the fairies being small. Alfred Nutt considered that 'the diminutive size of the fairy race belongs more especially to Teutonic tradi tion as developed within the last 2,000 years'238 but the existence of tiny beings in the folk tradition of many and varied peoples seems to belie that. The Passamaquoddy, who live close to the Canadian border, believe in two kinds of grotesque little people, for whom a European origin has been posited.239 'The idea of a dwarf who grants power or serves as guardian spirit is extremely widespread west of the Rocky Mountains. . .'239a EvansWentz (pp. 237-238) givesnumerous 233 Markale, op. cit., 140. 234 Charri?, op. cit., 194. 235 Handw?rterbuch, s.v.

Possibly the supposed abode of these beings does at times strengthen the tradition of their diminutive size. Of the Vikings in Irish folklore Christiansen notes that they 'have somehow been assimilated to the fairies, and depicted as small of stature, invariably old'! "'The Danes were surely small, how else could they live in these little rooms and passages in the raths?"'240 Of 'earth-houses and other structures' in Scotland Lewis Spence notes that 'The subterranean charac ter of these structures demanded a restricted height, and this may have helped to form the legend of a dwarfish race of Picts.'241 He writes that primitive man believed the soul to be of diminutive size, because the body could not otherwise contain it,242 and that references to the dead as diminutive are fairly numerous in folklore and 'old' literature.243 Irish tradi tion describes the soul leaving the body in the form of a diminutive creature - a dove, a butterfly, a mouse - and the external soul of a giant may reside in an egg in some stories. 244 'On some Greek vases the soul is seen issuing from the body as a pygmy. In Egypt, the ka, or double of the dead man, is frequently represented, sometimes on bas-reliefs, as a dwarf.245 2 The leipreachadn also shares his appearance with the dwarf and household familiar. The wrinkled, bearded face of an old man might be attributed to an obvious reason, old age; these 240 Reidar Th.

But the fairies often have the youth and beauty of ordinary mortals whereas the others often have the unnatural pallor of death. Spence argues that 'the goblin face and form is a replica of the manner in which generations of artists have sought to depict either the dead soul, or the dead body returned from the grave'. 'It represents humanity sick unto death, on the verge of mortality'.246 In this regard the motifs of 'Fairy otherworld confused with land of the dead' (F160.0.2) and 'Fairies as souls of the departed' (F25 1.2) are of interest. Fairy beauty and opulence are often only illusion, the ointment in the tale of Midwife to the Fairies (ML 5070) giving the power to see through it. But this glamour is not used by either leipreacha'n or dwarf who appear to the world in all their ugliness unless, in the case of the latter, invisibility is used. Perhaps the large nose, ears and feet and the awkward, un gainly carriage of the leipreachan and similar beings are related to the motif of the fairies having physical disabilities (F254.1): Scandinavian ellewomen with beautiful, but hol low, faces; the beautiful Highland Glaistigs concealing their goats' hooves with long green dresses; the Shetland Henkies so-called because they limped while dancing; the fairies of Mull with only one nostril; 'The Bean Sith was detected by her extraordinary voracity..., a frightful front tooth, the entire want of a nostril, a web foot, preternaturally long breasts, etc.'; 'the Aberdeenshire Brownies had a thumb with the rest of the fingers joined together,'247 and so forth. 'It seems likely,' in Katharine Briggs' opinion, 'that these characteristics were given to the fairies by people who believed them to be fallen angels, or yet more closely related to the Devil.'248 The origins most usually assigned by the folk to dwarfs 246 Ibid., 82. 247 Briggs, op. cit., 92-3. 248 Loe. cit.</page><page sequence="40">114 DIARMUID O GIOLLAIN and fairies are ultimately Christian; could church sculpture, then, have influenced people's ideas of their appearance? 'The function of gargoyles is to guard the church from the Devil by staring out in all directions';249 gargoyles have been sug gested as the origin of the Passamaquoddy's little people.250 The household familiar should be most susceptible to influ ence in this respect: he too guards a building and, in Arnold van Gennep's words, derives from the 'besoin generalement humain d'une protection directe et a demi humaine et concrete.'251 On the other hand the grotesque and the ugly are very commonly used to ward off evil -instance the hideous Sheelah-na-gigs in church sculpture flagrantly dis playing their genitals, 'nor does it seem a mere coincidence that guards, scaredevils and gargoyles in very different cul tures are shown in phallic display'252 - so that in this regard the household familiar as guardian of a homestead and the leipreachan and dwarf as treasure-guardians might well be ugly as added protection of their charges. But to attribute these features to church sculpture alone is certainly too facile an explanation, as points yet to be made should show, and even were that not so the derivation of the gargoyle's features should surely lead back to popular culture. The development of Hephaistos (or Hephaestus), the divine smith of the Greeks, in the popular sphere is of great significance. Motz shows that Herodotus equated Hephaistos with Ptah, the Egyptian god of jewellers, a misshapen dwarf with large head and crooked legs; but this was not the idealized Hephaistos of high mythology, 'but rather those grotesque representations of the god, which artisans, especially smiths, were in the habit of hanging up near their forge to dispel the evil spirits . ..

This setting apart sometimes has positive effects; it does not merely isolate, it elevates. Thus ugliness and deformities, while marking out those who possess them, at the same time make them sacred.,253a The legs and feet of the leipreachan and analogous beings are of peculiar interest, and in this respect let the lameness of Hephaistos and V9lundr be borne in mind.254 The leipreachan is bandy-legged, the dwarf's legs - if he has two - are bent and stunted; the Kobold, too, is bandy-legged while the trasgu is lame in the right leg. Such disabilities, of course, are commonly associated with dwarfism in humans so that the explanation may be, so to speak, near at hand.

Chthonic beings have already been mentioned and let it be noted that there is much in the traditions of the beings under discussion to indicate an association with the earth. Levi-Strauss writes that In mythology it is a universal characteristic of men born from the earth that at the moment they emerge from the depth they either cannot walk or they walk clumsily. This is the case of the chthonian beings in the mythology of the Pueblo: Muyingwu, who leads the emergence, and the chthonian Shumaikoli are lame ('bleeding-foot,' 'sore-foot'). The same happens to the Koskimo of the Kwakiutl after they have been swallowed by the chthonian monster, Tsiakish: when they returned to the surface of the earth "they limped forward or tripped side-ways."259 256a Killeen, op. cit., 204 257 Killeen, loe. cit.

The great majority of accounts was recorded in the first half of this century from people who were in their prime in the second half of the 19th century and consequently contextual details mirror aspects of the contemporary social life. Etymo logizing attempts to explain lorgaddn as a derivative of lorga, shin, with reference to the knee-breeches, would not have been appropriate in the 19th century when this mode of dress was the male norm. Fairies in Irish and British tradition often dressed much like the mortals for whom they were a reality; the German dwarfs sometimes wore antiquated peasant dress (see above). 'Frequently the fairies seem to adopt the style of dancing engaged in by the natives of the country they in habit, precisely as they sometimes adopt its costume.'261 Concerning the tradition of the hairy household familiar Spence asks Were the early Roman dead wrapped in dog-skins as some other Mediterranean corpses were in goat-skins, and did this practice give rise, partly or wholly, to a belief in hirsute ghosts or spirits? 262 The Roman household spirit was the lar.

This is probably the origin of the monastic dress often worn by duende and Kobold. These caps, as has been mentioned above, may bestow magic powers. Penzer notes magical hats in Grimm ('a wishing hat, and whoever puts it on can wish himself where he will, and immediately he is there'), in Busk's Folk-Lore ofRome (a hat of invisibility), in the Nibelungenlied ('Tarnhut, or hat of darkness') and in the Nifflunga Saga, and the 'Nebelkappe, or cloud-cap, of King Alberich, a dwarf of old German romance', and in tales from Brittany, Portugal, Japan and Arabia.264 Perhaps the leapreachan's power to mysteriously disappear ultimately derives from this conical hat which alone of all his recorded headgear is not - or was not - also worn by his human contemporaries. Note that the often pointed or horned hat of the shamans can be the most important part of their dress and the repository of their magical powers.264a The so-called Tollund man, an Iron Age corpse found in a Danish bog, wore a pointed leather cap, similar to those of miners of the Hallstatt culture found in the copper- and salt mines of the Tyrol.265 Witches and wizards today are often depicted as wearing tall conical hats. The members of the cofradi'as that take part in the Spanish Holy Week proces sions wear cardboard capirotes inside their hoods, which worn without the capirotes resemble night-caps (bearing in mind that excepting two holes for the eyes they completely cover the head). The Phrygian cap or bonnet, which is identified with the cap of liberty, given to the Roman slave upon emancipation and in more modern times become the symbol of Republican France, is similar. Late-mediaeval peasants' headgear resembled the night-cap. 264 N.M.

No overtly phallic significance is attached to the Germanic smith figure.'266 This pilos, or pileus as the Romans called it, whatever about its phallic significance, seems to resemble the cap of the dwarfs and leipreachan, and in both Athens and Rome it, like theirs, seems to have been primarily associ ated with skilled workers.267 By and large the colour of the leipreachan's clothing is more significant than the style. Red is by far the most com mon and crops up too in relation to the analogous supernatural beings, where it is the colour of the characteristic head-dress as well as other items of clothing (note motifs such as F233.3 Red fairy, F236.1.1 Fairies in red clothes, F236.3.2 Fairies with red caps). Red appears to be the colour par excellence of the clothing of the Irish fairies. 'It would not be an exaggeration to say that the general auspiciousness of reds and yellows is a direct outcome of sun-worship in one form or another,' writes Penzer.268 Hoffmann Krayer and Bichtold Staubli suggest sun and fire symbolism for the preferred red of the dwarfs and the red of the Kobold they see as symbolizing the fire in the hearth.269 Victor Turner, in 'Colour Classification in Ndembu Ritual', discusses the colour triad, black, white and red:270 'These are the only colours for which Ndembu possess primary terms.'271 He shows the primacy of these three colours in other cultures with comparative data from Africa, Malaya, Australia, North America, the Ancient World and archaeological literature.

We do have to invoke diffusion to explain why other colours . . . are ritually important in certain cultures.274 Turner shows this colour triad to be prominent in the burial practices and cave art of the European Palaeolithic.275 It is tempting to speculate on a continued pre-eminence of these three colours up to and beyond the dawn of the Christian era: white has come to mean 'good' and black 'evil' in Chris tian symbolism (as found in documents such as the Apo calypse,276 and in the idea of 'white' and 'black' magic); since fairies and dwarfs were fitted into the Christian scheme of things (see the traditional accounts of their origin), between the 'white' and the 'black' - they were seen as being neither good nor evil - perhaps it seemed appropriate to associate them with the remaining colour of the triad to indicate their neutral position between the angels and the devils.

When we make paired oppositions of this kind, red is con sistently given the same value, it is treated as a danger sign: hot taps, live electric wires, debit entries in account books, stop signs on roads and railways. This is a pattern which turns up in many other cultures besides our own and in these cases there is often a quite explicit recog nition that the 'danger' of red derives from its 'natural' association with blood.277 Could red as the favoured colour of these supernatural beings then be seen as a warning sign? They are not seen as being intrinsically evil - unlike, for example, vampires and were-wolves, who need no warning signs - but rather like the afore-mentioned electric wires: dangerous if interfered with. It does not seem possible to explain the pre-eminence of red in relation to its popularity as a dye in historic or pre historic times; it does not appear to be a colour that was more easily acquired than others nor does it at any stage seem to have had an importance that distinguished it from other dyes. Could the colour red be due to the perceptual conditions under which it was seen? For example a supernatural being 'seen' against the rising or setting sun (as in the case of at least one previously mentioned memorate) would momentarily cause the observer to be blinded, leaving an after-image in the eyes; the momentary closing of the eyes would cause the light of the sun to appear red through the closed eye-lids, thus possibly affecting the description of the being then, or at a later stage, identified;278 'Our eyes assemble a visual image on the retina in perhaps one-tenth of a second. But it is only in the subsequent two seconds of processing that we decide what we "see".'279 Green is the second most impor tant colour in the attire of fairies and leipreachan and in com 277 Edmund Leach^ L?vi-Strauss, Fontana/Collins, 1979, 22.

Red and green are so-called complementary colours: to fix one's eye on a red object for a while and then to look at a white sur face will cause a green, somewhat amorphous, version of the object to appear to the eye.280 To continue the hypothetical situation of the supernatural being seen against a red setting sun the red would give a green after-image and thus possibly lead to the two colours being subsequently associated with the supernatural creature. Also worthy of mention is that red and green, along with violet, constitute the so-called primary colours (although for paints and so forth these are red, blue and yellow); the first two, though, are much more common in nature, which may explain why violet never became so symbolically important. 'Green is generally acknowledged to be the fairy colour, particularly in Celtic countries, and for this reason is so un lucky that many Scotswomen refuse to wear green at all,' writes Briggs.281 In British folksong, the colour is associated with death - possibly indicating another connexion between the dead and the fairies.282 As Professor Krappe remarks: The souls of the dead may go into trees, becoming indistinguishable from genuine vegetation spirits. They naturally assume green, the colour of the fruit-bearing earth, which for that very reason becomes also the colour of death and of the nether powers.283 Dath na h-uaine is entered in Dineen's dictionary as 'the colour of green, death-colour'.284 Of the preferred grey and 280 L.

The appearance of other colours in the dress of super natural beings, if not reflecting the imagination of narrators, may be related to the after-image phenomenon. If having been dazzled by the sun one closes the eyes for a few moments the important point at this stage is the changes in colour you will see taking place, which are generally believed to occur because the bright light has slightly overbleached the retinal pigments and they are taking longer than usual to recover. ( ...) The colour changes themselves are probably due to the fact that some pig ments regenerate a bit more quickly than others and thus a sequence of colours is perceived.286 The colour or colours eventually identified may depend on a number of factors including the mental and visual re covery time of the observer. Unlikely or not this explanation cannot account for the occasional presence of brown or black in the apparel of the leipreachan and other beings (including the brownie). Accord ing to one of the Upanishads red is the colour of the original fire, white of the original water and black of the original earth.287 Brown, black and 'erdfarben' are mentioned among the colours of the dwarfs' clothing (see above), the last two particularly interesting in relation to a chthonic origin for these beings. This discussion of colour touches on the question of 'La lumiere mystique' as examined by Mircea Eliade.

In one account (supra) an Antrim 'leppercon' certainly plays the household familiar's role (pos sibly influenced by the gruagach, who was probably intro duced by immigrants). The leipreachan's association with ring-forts may also point to influences from the household familiar tradition as the forts were formerly human dwellings - indeed there is evidence of post-mediaeval habitation in some cases.288 A few of Crofton Croker's stories also deal with the household familiar tradition, but in a sophisticated milieu; perhaps these stories are of British origin since the class among which they were collected was, by and large, if not of British origin then fairly anglicized, and one could as well surmise that a native tradition of spirits who haunt houses might not thrive in an environment where the humble people live to a considerable extent in one-roomed cabins.289 Perhaps the native gentry possessed a household spirit tradi tion (cf. Crofton Croker's Mac Carthy) and passed it on, with its mansions (plus servants and nannies? ), to the new aristocracy, which possessed a similar tradition - and like other aspects of upper class culture it filtered down to the peasantry in the years succeeding the upheavals of the 17th century, but in a corrupted form, or filtered down to merge with peasant traditions then extant (and in this respect we 287a In M?phistoph?l?s 21-110 [p. 109J and Occultism, Witch craft and Cultural Fashions, Chicago 1976, 100, 144, 118-9. 288 Sean P. ?

According to Westropp stone monuments all over Ireland are connected with the pu'ca.291 Ring-forts are often attributed to the 'Danes', a historic people distorted by folk tradition, as are the Moors: Con el nombre de moros y sus equivalentes se desig nan en muchas regiones espafioles y de otros lugares de Europa (por ejemplo, en Sicilia o en Provenza), a los autores de todo monumento antiguo cuyo origen se desconoce.292 Of such 'mythical races' Vicente Risco writes that the belief in mythical semi-human or almost human populations, inhabitants of prehistoric monuments, ruins, great rocks, springs, etc., is found everywhere, often in relation with hid den treasures: 'En Europa existe unha verdadeira mitoloxia da prehistoria. . .' Referring to Reinach's work in this field he notes that dolmens are rarely sepulchres in popular tradi tion; in France they are known as Four des Geants, Maison des Fees, Maison du Diable, in Switzerland Pierre du Sauvage, Hexensteiner, Heidensteiner, in Scandinavia Elfstenar or Elfsquarnar, in Germany Tedtensteine (recte Todtensteine?) (Note the forms leaba Dhiarmada agus Grainne and 'giant's grave' in Ireland); elves always live in caves or souterrains, gnomes and 'Koboldos' (presumably Kobalt rather than Kobold) go under the earth and are linked with mines and treasures, the korrigans are found at springs, particularly 290 Patricia Lysaght, 'Irish Banshee Traditions' in B?aloideas 42-44(1974-76), 111-3. 291 Spence, op. cit., 183 quoting from TJ.

He observes that they appear to be associated with the sepultures of almost every period -the New Stone Age, the Iron Age, even churchyards.294 Generally the leipreachan's preferential abode is far from man's. Trees, bushes and woods may be his choice because of that, or perhaps his association with the lone fairy tree or bush, or with the trees that grow in ring-forts, by extension becomes an association with trees in general. A connexion between German dwarfs and forest spirits owing to the green the former often wear has been suggested above, as has Krappe's assertion that green becomes the colour of death because the dead enter trees and assume their colour. Irish tradition often tells of souls spending their purgatory in trees.295 In Egypt 'tradition has it that when the Egyptian gods were displaced, first by Christian and then by Moslem saints, the trees were allotted to them.'296 The whitethom is the fairy tree above all others and in relation to this Estyn Evans has written: In Ireland the trees which the elder faiths had en dowed with magic qualities were all small trees and shrubs - especially the rowan, holly, elderberry and whitethom - and the evidence of archaeology and palaeobotany is that these plants first became common in the prehistoric landscape as weeds of cultivation fol lowing forest clearance by early cultivators.

Hills, mountains, rocks, crevices and caves may also be favoured because they are far from human habitation, but they too are part of a wider tradition, being similarly popular with continental supernatural beings. Note that these beings appear to live in, rather than on, the hills and mountains and thus the emphasis is on the subterranean aspect of this habitat, as is also the case of the ring-forts. 'Mountains are the nearest thing to the sky, and are thence endowed with a twofold holiness', writes Eliade: 'on one hand they share in the spatial symbolism of transcendence - they are "high", "vertical", "supreme", and so on -and on the other, they are the especial domain of all hierophanies of atmosphere, and there fore, the dwelling of the gods.'297a Of the aes si'de, fairies, of Old Irish tradition Gerard Murphy writes From ancient times they have been looked upon as dwelling either in certain hills called sidi (. . .), or in faraway islands, or beneath the waters of the sea or of lakes. To the learned in Gaelic Ireland the ades si'de were known as Tuatha De' Donann (later Danann), which originally meant the Peoples of the Goddess Donu.298 The Tuatha De Danann were supposedly dispossessed by the invading Gaels. 297 E.

Thus the Tuatha De' retired underground and the Daghdha assigned to each of their chiefs a sz'dh or 'fairy mound', and throughout the countryside such mounds are still regarded - or were until very recently - as the special dwelling places of the fairy people.299 Andrew Lang considered the fairies to be "a lingering memory of the Chthonian beings 'the Ancestors'.",300 Such beings, according to Spence, were regarded in Greek myth as subter ranean dwellers who primarily presided over crops.301 In the case of the dwarfs living underground is additionally approp riate as they are skilled workers in metal, which they mine themselves.

The lezpreachan is most commonly encountered at night. This is to be expected: night is when supernatural beings are most active and mortals at their most vulnerable. This ties in with general European tradition - the sensitive eyes of the dwarfs cannot stand the sunlight and the dwarfs themselves disappear with the first cock-crow, and so forth. The natural and supernatural worlds tend to parallel each other to an extent and yet in certain crucial respects the one seems to be the antithesis of the other: the upper half goes to the Gael and the lower half to the Tuatha De in the physical division of the land, day goes to man and night to the spirit in the temporal division of the world: One of the characteristics of the otherworld with which the Irish and Welsh imagination makes constant play is the relativity of time and space: perspectives are reversed and brevity becomes length and length brevity as one crosses the tenuous border between the natural and the supernatural.303 301b In Myths, Dreams and Mysteries, Collins 1970, 172.

In particular, it is well known that numerous peoples throughout the world have attached a very special significance to the juncture or interstice between two distinct temporal periods, regarding it in some sense as time outside of time or as a temporary resump tion of mythic or primordial time. Similarly the Celts have treated the festival of Samhain . . . as a time apart which was charged with a peculiar preternatural energy, and within it they have concentrated many of their great mythic events. During this interval the normal order of the universe is suspended, the barriers between the natural and the supernatural are temporarily removed, the sz'dh lies open and all divine beings and the spirits of the dead move freely among men and interfere, sometimes violently, in their affairs.305 Parallels between the natural and supernatural world can also be seen in the attitudes to good and evil; both are seen to exist among mortals, but with a tendency towards the values of Christianity, and among the fairies, but with a bias against these values: fairies are supposed to work as usual on Sundays,306 brownies, trasnos and Kobolde fear Christian 304 Spence, op. cit., 169-73. 305 Mac Cana, Mythology, 126-7.

Perhaps this anti pathy is related to the origins ascribed to these beings as God's rejects: Fallen Angels, Eve's hidden children, and so on. 5 The leipreachan is usually depicted hammering nails into a shoe, although there is a picture of him sewing a shoe; the noise of the former must have some bearing on its popularity: it means that the leipreachan can be detected before he is seen and consequently it is likely that strange noises of this kind have given rise to a large number of legends. Tacking and sewing are both parts of shoemaking but tacking is only applied when there is a separate sole, of which the earliest Irish evidence is from the 16th or 17th century.307 Nailed boots were not introduced until the 19th century, from America:308 'In 1909 David Meade Randolph obtained a patent for fastening the soles and heels to the inner soles by means of little nails, brads, sprigs or tracks.'309 It is intriguing to think that new technology may have streng thened a folk tradition! The German dwarfs are also skilled craftsmen and are pro ficient at a wide variety of trades, including shoemaking, but particularly working in precious stones and metals. "The divine smith of the Greeks", writes Motz, "appears as a rather clear example of the 'mythical smith' as which we have also recognized the Germanic dwarf.",310 There is 'much similarity between the works of the Greek and the Germanic smith figure: all the objects produced by the dwarfs find a place within the categories of gifts given by Hephaistos.'3 1 We have already mentioned the lameness of the master smith and his development into a pygmy; the lameness the price to be paid 307 O'Nefll, op. cit., 47. 308 Loe. cit. 309 The Encyclopaedia Brittanica, Cambridge 1911, s.v.

V,lundr lives in similar fashion. Sometimes the dwarfs live in the earth.314 The significance of smithcraft was recognized in traditional Irish society; magical powers were attributed to the smith since early times and he was the most respected of craftsmen.315 The religious context of metallurgy is discussed by Eliade, according to whom a 'mythology of metals' succeeded the 'mythology of polished stone;' 'the richest and most charac teristic was developed around iron.' Meteoric iron was worked long before the ferrous ores of the earth and thus was scarce, precious 'and its use was principally ritual.' The development of metallurgy 'had important religious consequences. Besides the celestial sacredness of the sky, immanent in meteorites, there is now the telluric sacredness of the earth, in which mines and ores share. Metals "grow" in the bosom of the earth. Caves and mines are assimilated to the womb of Mother Earth.'316 Hence there is 'a hidden symmetry between metallurgy and obstetrics'.316a He discusses the world-wide rites practised by miners. 'The metallurgist, like the black smith and, before him, the potter, is a "master of fire",' by which 'he accelerates the "growth" of ores, [and] he makes them "ripe" in a miraculously short time. Smelting proves to be the means of "acting faster" but also of acting to make a different thing from what already existed in nature.

In many mythologies the divine smiths forge the weapons of the gods, thus insuring them victory over dragons or other monstrous beings . . . In addition, this god-smith has connections with music and song, just as in a number of societies the smiths and braziers are also musicians, poets, healers and magicians. It seems, then, that on different levels of culture (an indication of great antiquity) there is an intimate connection between the art of the smith, occult techniques (shamanism, magic, healing, etc.), and the arts of song, of the dance, and of poetry.'316c The leipreachan's craft is of a different nature, but he is an artisan dwarf and his association with treasure suggests that smithcraft may have had some bearing on the tradition. It has been suggested by Professor Tierney 'that these magic cobblers of Ireland are to be identified with the Lugoves to whom the cobblers of Osma in Spain set up an inscription in pagan days'317 as 'it has long ago been suggested that the name leipreachan itself, with its variants, contains that of Lugh, as Lugoves clearly does.'318 The inscription at Osma is 'Lugovibvs sacrum L.L.

Inexhaustible purse furnishes money' is a common international motif and one closely associated with the leipreachan. Maolmhuire an Sparain, ancestor of the Sweenys, was the owner of a purse bestowed on him by a fairy woman; every time it was opened a small penny and a shilling would be found inside, according to a 16th century manuscript.321 A poem pre-dating the 17th century manuscript in which it was found mentions the sparan na scillinge.322 The 18th cen tury poet Eoghan Rua 0 Suiilleabhaiin refers to an inexhaustible purse: Ba mhath an aiise e ag Fortunatus, Do chuireadh a lamh go daina ann sios Chun or bui is plata do bhronna ar bhabaibh, 'S niorbh' fholamh go brach e ach lan go snulm.323 320 G. ? M. op. cit., 133. Even if the connexion with Lughcanbe dismissed, it is of interest that the names of divinities are etymologically related to the names of some of the beings under discussion: 'fairy' ultimately derives from fata, the Fates (Concise Oxford Dictionary); 'lutin' via Old French netun from Neptunus (Nouveau Petit Larousse Illustr? 1952); as for the Galican 'diario'\ 'sabido ? que na Edade Media, Diana convirteuse nunha sorte de demo femenino, e a?nda se supuxo un demo Dianum, de cuio nome v?n, con seguranza, o noso "dia?o" ' (Otero Pedrayo, op. cit., 298).

N.M. Penzer claims a Hindu origin for this purse.324 Similarmagic objects are often given by supernatural beings; instance Sebillot's account of fions giving a woman a bowl of grain that will always be full unless she betrays the secret325 (F348.7). Gifts of the German dwarfs are of a similar nature.36 'D1602.11. Self-returning magic coin' is a similar thing, a motif common in Ireland.32 The Daghdha, the 'Good God', king of the Tuatha De Danann has two special attributes, his club and his cauldron. The latter is the characteristic vessel of plenty of the Celtic otherworld 'from which no company ever went unsatisfied'. Its possession identifies him as lord of the otherworld and its eternal abundance, and it was no doubt in this capacity that he was reputed 'to control the weather and the crops.'328 Dwarfs are fabulously rich. 'It appears probable', writes Lewis Spence, 'that the idea of fairy treasure had its incep tion in stories of gold and silver articles buried with the dead in mounds and tumuli.'329 But the subterranean character of dwarfs and fairies is also relevant, leading to the idea that in some way all the valuables buried in the earth must belong to them; also the dwarfs being highly skilled artisans, very often working in precious stones and metals, must make for an easy association with buried treasure. But we can also identify buried treasure with prehistoric monuments, old stone arrow-heads and old clay pipes: they are all objects of uncertain origin and are thus attributed to various 'mythical 324 Penzer, op. cit., Vol. I, 25 et seq. 325 S?billot, op. cit., Vol. I, 458. 326 Handw?rterbuch, s.v.

We have al ready spoken of prehistoric monuments; the arrow-heads are attributed to the fairies and are seen to be the agents of such maladies as 'fairy-stroke' or 'poc si"; the pipes are often known as 'leipreachan's pipes' or 'Danes' pipes'. In Ireland the fairies or various supernatural animals may be treasure guardians, and the treasure itself may have been hidden by 'Danes, Greeks, Spaniards, or other foreigners.'330 The 'Danes' in particular were reputed to have left much buried treasure after them when they had to flee Ireland.331 Buried treasure is often directly associated with the ring-forts.332 In Galicia, pre-Celtic, Celtic and Roman monuments are attributed to the Moors, whose influence there was negligible, and they are supposed to still live underground, guard treasures and mysteriously come and go.333 The often illusory nature of the buried treasure may be an instance of the glamour which sometimes makes the fairies beautiful, or of the relativity of human values and the 'reversal of perspectives' of the supernatural world to which Proinsias Mac Cana refers. Wealth does not seem to be associated with the household familiar. Caro Baroja does mention the duende as a guardian of hidden treasure, but this may be a different tradition - perhaps literary as he shows the literary duende to play this role.334 The familiar does bring luck to the household and the acquisition of wealth on its part might be a logical exten sion of that tradition.

Stories of persons who reappear after death are inextricably confused with tales of the fairies'.338 Fairies are liable to be encountered where a coffin has touched the ground.339 People thought to be dead are often recognized among the fairy host and fairy abduction is camouflaged by the apparent death of the person concerned - but here the fairies give an explanation for untimely death rather than present an instance of confusion with the dead.

Limerick, the local people believed they would go when they died;340 this hill is inseparably linked with Donn (Fi'rinne), the ancient Irish god of the dead,341 become a local fairy king in the folk tradition. Wentz instances country people of his acquaintance who identified the fairies with the spirits of the dead.342 Spence sees the fairies' association with barrows, standing stones and other ancient places of sepulture as further evi dence of this confusion;3f3 but this is open to dispute: it 336 Ibid., ix. 337 Ibid., 192 et seq. 338 ?

It is the mysterious, inexplicable, rather than the sepulchral, nature of these monuments that has caused their association with the fairies. The same is true of hidden treasure and it is of interest that 'in Iceland buried hoards are thought of as belonging to and guarded by the dead.'344 'In the minds of our pagan ancestors', wrote Eleanor Hull, 'there was very little distinction between the dead and the fairies, who were, perhaps, only the spirits of an earlier race.. .'345 Nevertheless there is plenty of evidence in modem folk tradition of identified local spirits, and of the return or sighting of the ghosts of known dead people, all distinct from the fairies. One might add, too, that many of these identified local spirits have been of a notoriously evil nature, contrasting with the ambiguous moral position of the fairies. Still, Traditions regarding spirits are so loosely defined in Ireland that it has been very difficult up to the present to classify them and, at the same time, to distinguish between fairies, ghosts, the returned dead, spirits, and other supernatural manifestations.346 Perhaps, as Hull suggests, time-scale is the important thing here, ghosts and spirits taking their identity from Christian belief and teaching, fairies taking theirs from pre Christian belief. 346a 344 Jacqueline Simpson, Icelandic Folktales and Legends, Berkeley and Los Angeles 1979, 184. 345 Folklore of the British Isles (1928), 245-7 quoted in Spence, op. cit., 81. 346 ?

[Mediaeval Metaphysicians] 'divided all invisible beings into four distinct classes: the Angels, who in character and function are parallel to the gods of the ancients . . . are the highest; below them are the Devils or Demons, who correspond to the fallen angels of Christianity; the third class includes all Element?is, sub-human Nature-Spirits, who are generally regarded as having pygmy stature, like the Greek daemons; and the fourth division comprises the Souls of the Dead, and the shades or ghosts of the dead'. Evans Wentz, op. cit., 241.</page><page sequence="65">THE LEIPREACHAN: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 139 In relation to 'The Ancestral Character of Fairy Spirits' Spence writes It is. . . clear that the spirits of the dead ancestors frequently behave very much as do the fairies, who are wont to be irritable and exacting, who expect tributes of food and drink, who remain invisible, and who exercise a close and sometimes almost "governessy" oversight of human affairs.347 He continues: It is a fact in folk-lore that most ancestral spirits are regarded as the conservators of tribal virtue and decency, and this would go far to explain the fairy insistence on decorum and neatness.348 The household familiar is most relevant in this connexion and is often seen to be attached to a particular family. 'The banshee is notoriously an ancestral form, haunting families of distinction.'349 Besides the similarities that Spence notes it is worth remarking that people believed to be dead, but who really have been abducted by the fairies, or people who are accepted as being dead, often exercise a benign influence over their kin-folk: they give wamings, or return to nurse babies (in the case of the former, at any rate), and so forth. 350 There is Irish material, too, to support the idea of fairies as elementary spirits; many have seen their wearing of the green as evidence of a close connexion with nature, and their com mon association with certain trees as further proof. The occa sional wearing of brown, a subterranean abode and certain features that point to a chthonic origin suggest an identifica tion with the earth itself. Elizabeth Andrews was probably the best-known - if not the only - Irish exponent of the theory that the fairies were the recollection of an aboriginal race, and her ideas are set 347 Spence, op. cit., 85. 348 Loe. cit. 349 Ibid., 86. 350 6 S?illeabh?in, Handbook, 247.</page><page sequence="66">140 DIARMUID O GIOLLAIN out in her book, Ulster Folklore, published in 1913. 'Are Fairies derived from Godlike Forms? ' asks Spence, and bear ing in mind that the learned of Gaelic Ireland saw the aes side and the Tuatha De Danann as being one and the same, we might answer 'yes'. But this seems too facile an explanation, and anyway, what did the learned of Gaelic Ireland know - or care - about peasant tradition? A statement of E.S. Hartland's suggests that some caution is required: no theory will explain the origin of the fairy super stitions which does not also explain the nature and origin of every other supernatural being worshipped or dreaded by uncivilized mankind throughout the world.351 Irish fairy belief is only one, local, manifestation of a much wider tradition and an explanation of its origin that does not hold for the whole is untenable. But the Tuatha De have influ enced that belief, whether through direct continuity from pre-Christian times of traditions of them, or through later interference from the learned world; the existence of names of Tuatha De luminaries such as Aine and Donn among the chieftains of the fairy world is evidence of this. That 'the fairy tradition is to a large extent the broken down folk-memory of a definite and far-reaching cultus or system of worship which must, at a distant epoch, have had sanctions in practically every part of the British insular group'352 is one of the theories which Spence discusses. The fact that the fairies may be associated with certain days of the week and times of the year he sees as evidence for the existence of religious festivals with which they were iden tified, but he admits himself that while individual days have local significance in this respect there is no unanimity - in deed he mentions no less than four days -, while the two festivals with which the fairies are most closely identified, namely Bealtaine and Samhain, are associated with the super natural in general. Nevertheless, his thesis is that 351 In The Science of Fairy Tales, 349-51 quoted in Spence, op. cit., 123. 352 Spence, op. cit., 169.</page><page sequence="67">THE LEIPREACHAN: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 141 throughout Keltic Britain a very definite belief ob tained until comparatively recent times that the fairies had an extraordinary influence at certain seasons once associated with religious ritual occasion, either as dis credited deities, or because they were regarded as un friendly to a still later pagan faith.353 He instances the leaving of offerings of food and drink for the fairies in many parts of Britain, something with which the Irish are also familiar.354 'An eighth-century hymn declares that until St Patrick preached the Gospel the Irish people adored the gods of the sz'dh', writes Proinsias Mac Cana; but 'supplication and adoration of the native deities' was one of those matters on which the early Christian Church allowed little compromise.355 We know that the Celts were not the first people to settle in Ireland, and it would be unrealistic to suppose that the traditions and beliefs of the indigenous popula tion were annulled by their arrival. There is in fact a strong presumption that the literary account [of the retreat of the Tuatha De] is coloured by this popular substratum which came into its own once more as the Celtic gods were depreciated through the establish ment of Christianity and the influence of its teaching.356 Estyn Evans sees the veneration of thorn trees - and the cult of holy wells - as beingprobably megalithic in origin.357 Reidar Th. Christiansen, in 'Some Notes on the Fairies and the Fairy Faith' (in Bo Almqvist, et al., Hereditas, Dublin 1975, pp. 95-111), discusses some aspects of Irish and Scandinavian fairy belief, particularly the popular accounts 353 Ibid., 173. 354 Ibid.,116-7. 355 Mac Cana,M);?/io/o^&gt;;, 65. 356 Ibid., 65-6.

He sees the belief as belonging to 'a common human heritage, having as its function the explanation of un expected happenings, such as the death of young people. The explanation that they are not dead but taken away seems more reasonable. (... ) The idea of a hidden world as con tained in the legends has been developed and transmitted in various ways but in itself it seems to be part of the common heritage of man' (p. 1 11). Elves and dwarfs are clearly distinct from each other in Teutonic mythology. Motz reveals a bipartite division of elves in Old Norse sources, 'one part living in the sky and lost to view, close to the gods and the light of the sun and the other on and in the earth and alive'.358 These are the light elves and the black elves, the latter coinciding completely with the dwarfs. While the elves are the recipients of sacrifices from mortals, 'Neither poems nor sagas tell us of cultic offerings to the dwarfs'.359 Indeed it seems that the dwarfs are not taken that seriously: 'The sagas contain a recurrent episode in which a dwarf is defeated by human strength and offers a priceless gift as ransom; at times he places a curse on the object.'360 This seems strangely reminiscent of many legends of the lezpreachan, who does not inspire the same fear as other supernatural beings, such as the fairies: people often deliberately set out to capture him, with little fear, it seems, for their safety. 'Grotesque and defeated, of low social esteem, dwarfs do not receive the love of woman naturally';36' the leipreacha'n seems to be in a similar position. It is worth noting, however, that modem German folk tradition seems to contradict the material with which Motz deals, and the dwarfs seem to share many traits with the fairies. But if Motz's sources - and the Irish lezpreachdn? - seem to reveal the dwarf in his earlier form then we might attribute some of the traits of the modem German dwarfs 358 Motz, op. cit., 99. 359 Ibid., 104. 360 Ibid., 105. 361 Loc. cit.</page><page sequence="69">THE LEIPREACHAN: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 143 to confusion with fairies, and the fact that the household familiar also seems to be mixed up in this suggests a large overlap between these three similar classes of beings - fairies, dwarfs and familiars - in modem folklore. The fairies always seemed to have formed a complete community; as for the dwarfs, 'There were no women among them and hence they had no children. But, as and when they disappeared, two princes whom the gods had given them replaced them by other dwarfs, moulded from their natal earth';362 the house hold familiar has always been a solitary creature. Motz mentions 'the alliterative formula Aesir ok alfar, gods and elves, occurring repeatedly in the poems of the Edda'363 but 'dwarfs are very rarely cited with the gods'.364 This of course parallels the connexion between the Tuatha De Danann and the fairies in Ireland, but is this a coincidence among the learned of Ireland and Scandinavia, or does it reveal a general association of fairies with gods which was once recognized? Georges Dumezil has pointed out that there are two fundamentally different ways of behaviour for the sovereign gods of Indo-European mythology ... Ouranos and Varuna are the gods of an older generation who rule by magic, whom Dumezil calls dieux lieurs, and who are always overthrown by the more modem gods Zeus and Indra, aggressive gods, dieux combattants, who fight in the way of men in open battle with a man's courage and a man's cunning. Dumezil understands the account of such a victory as the reflection in myth and literature of a new stage in the history of the world in which man has attained greater confidence in his powers . . . Dumezil points to the monstrous appearance of the older gods: less the personification of man, they are closer to the forces of chaos, the primeval antagonists of cosmic order.365 362 New Larousse Encyclopaedia of Mythology, Hamlyn 1978, 249. 363 Motz, op. cit., 95. 364 Ibid., 106. 365 Ibid., 109-??.</page><page sequence="70">144 DIARMUID 0 GIOLLAIN Motz sees the dwarfs as ultimately belonging to the older generation of gods (a position they share with Hephaistos); he cites a recurrent theme in the tales of the dwarfs 'in which the smith-magician was overcome by an aggressive warrior', 366 'yet they are not sovereigns destroyed, but rather the servants of the new rulers who present their inestimable gifts'.367 The dwarfs do not have mother or father but grew from the body of a giant or from the earth, like the less anthropomorphic, archaic, deities resembling natural phenomena, who were not sexually begotten.368 The deformity of Vslundr and Hephaistos he sees as 'part of the concept of the mythical smith' and he notes Dumezil's observation of physically defective figures in the Indo European pantheon: 'In these cases the mutilation, self-willed or inflicted, was the price paid for a certain acquisition': that of magic smithcraft.369 There is no Germanic equivalent of the fall from heaven of Hephaistos and other smith figures, he writes, but the elves have left heaven for the earth: . . . the word dvergr [dwarf] may carry the meaning of 'physical defect', and one could assume that some gods fell from the heavens, were thereafter called 'the crippled ones' and became the magicians of metalcraft. One might in this way understand the change of residence of these gods and their fusion with the dwarfs.370 Motz notes that the theory he proposes contradicts the Eddas where dwarfs come from the body of a giant, but he shows with the example of Hephaistos that conflicting accounts may exist side by side. Creation from the body of primeval being belongs to legends which tell of the birth of the cosmos and its regions: the mountains, the sea, the sky.

( ...) This fear of iron on the part of the elves has been construed as the dislike of a Stone-Age folk for metal implements, which they regard as magical.'372 This belief - so well-attested in Irish tradition - suggests a clear difference in time-scale between the fairies on the one hand and supernatural artisans (metal-workers or workers with metal tools) such as dwarfs and the leipreachan on the other. The fairies belong to an agrarian society, sow their own crops, and possess cattle and horses, and hunting is a favoured pastime;373 they move their residence twice a year at times suggestive of transhumance. They do not seem to have any particularly important developed skills: magic is their great gift. The dwarfs and leipreachan on the other hand are technologically more advanced, being a select group (males only) whose great skill is developed rather than innate and whose craftsmanship always seems more important than the magical powers also attributed to them (which at any rate do not appear to be sufficient to deter mortals from inter fering with them). The origin and function of the household familiar seems much more clear-cut; it reflects, in Van Gennep's previously quoted words, the 'besoin gene'ralement humain d'une pro tection directe et a demi humaine et concrete'.

Their image was crudely sculptured from a tree stump and was usually situated at the approaches of the farmhouse ... Their altar was also the hearth and they received similar homage.374 There was only one family lar, who symbolized the house 'and was invoked on all important occasions of family life ... The family Lar was habitually represented in a juvenile aspect with curly hair, a short tunic and in a dancing posture.'375 It is not difficult to see how the household familiar and dwarf tradition could be confused in districts in which both traditions are known: both are male supernatural beings, the one solitary, the other gregarious; both are seen in a protec tive role, one of the homestead, the other of precious stones and metals; the familiar often does work in and about the house or completes unfinished tasks, which suggests dwarf like skill; both are morally ambiguous beings and may become quite troublesome if vexed; the familiar ensures the luck of the household, which to a certain extent involves the acquisi tion of wealth and might thus lead to an identification with wealth itself, as in the dwarf's case; they look very much alike in folk tradition, but this may be due to confusion - in the case of the Roman lar could a 'juvenile aspect' be represented in terms of reduced stature, and could some of the traits of the dwarf then grow from this, particularly ugliness, to ward off evil? -; both are humble beings, the dwarfs, in Motz's words, 'the servants of the new rulers who present their inestimable gifts', the familiar, with his com plaint 'ich bin herrenlos', very much dependent on man and prepared to follow when his master changes house(ML 7020). Neither is it difficult to surmise how dwarfs and fairies might be confused: there exists a tradition of diminutive fairies for a start - but might this be due to interference from the dwarf tradition? -; both dwarf and fairy are gregarious, leading perhaps to a community including women and chil 374 Larousse Mythology, 218. 375 Loe. cit.</page><page sequence="73">THE LEIPREACHAN: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 147 dren beingunderstood in the case of the former; fairy glamour gives the appearance of opulence in, for example, Midwife to the Fairies (ML 5070) where the fairies in reality are very often ragged, hungry-looking and living in a damp cave - could glamour, then, be seen as obscuring a dwarf-like pro saicness? -; both are morally ambivalent beings and can be most disagreeable to mortals; great wealth is associated with both of them, with the dwarf through his work with precious stones and metals, with the fairy presumably through his magical powers, the bestowing of inexhaustible gifts being identified, perhaps, with the endless fruits of the dwarf's tireless labours; very often they have a similar habitat, fairy hills and knolls, for instance, being easily identified with a subterranean habitation; both dwarfs and fairies - as well as 'Danes', Picts and Moors - become a sort of mythical race to whom ancient monuments are ascribed, or with whom they are associated; both dwarfs and fairies have been given an origin which fits them into the Christian scheme of things. The leipreachan is identified with the fairies because as a solitary being he cannot form a distinctive group on his own and must be either a phenomenon suigeneris or a member of the fairy tribe, the latter being the easier solution: the bean sz' must have been in a similar position; her name identifies her with the fairies but her role is of a different order; the puzca, too, is often identified with the fairies, for whom puicaz', in deed, often appears as a generalized name. Other reasons for this identification include his diminutive stature, his dress, his moral neutrality, his wealth and inexhaustible purse, his habitat, his skill, perhaps, and of course his sobriquet, 'the fairy shoemaker' - 'fairy' here, note, not necessarily being an adjective - and the fact that a supernatural cobbler's clientele would most appropriately be supernatural beings of whom the fairies in Irish tradition form the only community. There seems to be no modem indigenous tradition of a household familiar in Ireland, but certain features associated with the leipreachadn suggest confusion either with an imported household familiar (as in the North-East; and possibly failed plantations and the new land-owning class in other parts of</page><page sequence="74">148 DIARMUID 0 GIOLLAIN the country maintained the tradition long enough to have some slight influence on that of the leipreacha'n) or with a native one, now defunct, or the absorption, at some stage, of a native household familiar by the leipreachdn. Both super natural beings are solitary and share the same general appear ance: this alone would make the existence of the two, side by side, quite confusing; both, to an extent, are guardians, one of the house, the other of great riches, and, as I have al ready mentioned, the luck of the house assured by the familiar often leads to enrichment, and conversely - and tantalizingly - we are told of the lutharagan that 'anyone that ever caught one is supposed to have great luck about a house.'376 The familiar shows great versatility in the tasks he executes - or completes - in the house and farm while the leipreachadn, besides his shoemaking craft, does the very familiaresque task of working the quern in a number of accounts. Neither is intrinsically good nor intrinsically bad. Both are at least partly associated with the dwellings of man, the familiar with those of the present, the leipreachdn mainly with those of the past - ring-forts. Both are humble beings, neither greatly feared by man and often directly abused. The West Clare luthraddn (supra) entering houses, sometimes coming down the chimney, recalls the familiar. At this stage it seems superfluous to enumerate comparisons between the leipreachan and the dwarf. Rather it seems more useful to note the differences between the two beings, and the first that comes to mind is also the most obvious, one is solitary, the other gregarious, a contradiction which might be explained in the following manner: the existence of a gregarious race of male supernatural beings is bound to lead to perplexity so that the tendency would be either to turn them into a full society including women and children - like the fairies - or to turn them into solitary beings - like the household familiar; the former seems to have been the case in Germany, but in Ireland, where there does not seem to have been an indigenous household familiar to cause con 376 IFC S 520: 356-7.</page><page sequence="75">THE LEIPREACHAN: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 149 fusion, the latter situation came about. If this were the case it might show how the leipreachan half-lost his association with precious metals (which he does not work, but possesses), because mining is not a solitary task, and thus had his trade specialized so that it could be solitary, and became a shoe maker. But why a shoemaker rather than, say, a potter or a tailor, jobs also carried out by German dwarfs? It seems that the association with metal-work would be lost if he became a potter, but the tailor and shoemaker at least use metal tools. Tailoring, however, is a mediaeval trade, which began in the towns. Perhaps it has to do with his clientele, fairies, who are particularly fond of dancing. The leipreachan, then, belongs to an Irish dwarf race and may have changed for the above reasons from being gregarious to being solitary, and if the old literature reflects the folk tradition we see him in his gregarious state in the luchorpacin - but we should be cautious here: the luchorpain or lupracain of Aidedh Ferghusa are a community living beyond the seas, they are not ugly or deformed (indeed Fergus finds their queen sexually desirable), and except for their size, the super natural knowledge of Eisirt and Iubhdan and the latter's magical possession they do not differ greatly from the Ulster people; Winberry suggests that Iubhdain's magic cauldron anticipates the shilling purse and his magic shoes 'suggesting perchance the leprechaun's eventual occupation with cob bling,'377 but none of his other magical possessions suggests any aspect of the modem leipreachan tradition, the cauldron, crucially, is not an inexhaustible container but rather has the power of transforning what is put into it, and there is no suggestion that the lupracain are artisans of any kind, let alone shoemakers. On the other hand, we do not know to what extent Aidedh Ferghusa may have been based on folk tradi tion. Other early literary sources indicated in the beginning of this paper give origins for ungainly luchorpain which tally with those given in a later section of the paper to the Ger manic dwarfs. 377 Winberry, op. cit., 67.</page><page sequence="76">150 DIARMUID O GIOLLAIN Some interference from a household familiar tradition seems evident but since no such being exists in the folk tradi tion of the greater part of Ireland today it is possible that this interference is foreign in origin, most likely British. Motz sees the dwarfs as deliving from an earlier period than the elves. But the latter's fear of iron and the former's use of it, plus the other factors discussed above, seem to contradict this. Iron protects against evil spirits but both fairies and dwarfs are neither good nor evil; however, the nasty side of the fairies does induce fear and respect while nobody seems to be too perturbed by irate dwarfs or leipreachain - 'nobody takes precautions against the poor little leipreachan',378 and indeed his humility is such that he can be held by a stare - which seems to be simply the imposition of a superior will rather than any recollection of Balor of the Evil Eye, as sug gested by Winberry379 - and can only escape (and disappears into thin air suggesting the invisibility bestowed by dwarfs' caps) by distractinghis captor, at whichhe is expert and which is essential to him, being basically his only defence. The leipreachan 's relationship to supernatural artisan dwarfs of other countries seems undeniable, the leipreacha'n simply being an Irish expression of a wider tradition shared by many European peoples.
