Melvin, Paul C. Begeman and Michele J. Grimm Wayne State University Copyright © 2006 SAE International ABSTRACT The purpose of this study is to provide an understanding of driver kinematics, injury mechanisms and spinal loads causing thoracolumbar spinal fractures in Indianapolis- type racing car drivers. Crash reports from 1996 to 2006, showed a total of forty spine fracture incidents with the thoracolumbar region being the most frequently injured (n=15). Seven of the thoracolumbar fracture cases occurred in the frontal direction and were a higher injury severity as compared to rear impact cases. The present study focuses on thoracolumbar spine fractures in Indianapolis-type racing car drivers during frontal impacts and was performed using driver medical records, crash reports, video, still photographic images, chassis accelerations from on-board data recorders and the analysis tool MADYMO to simulate crashes. A 50th percentile, male, Hybrid III dummy model was used to represent the driver. Simulation output of thoracolumbar spine forces ranged from 683 to 4547 N in the x- direction, 475 to 6623 N in the y-direction, and 4825 to 13,211 N in the z-direction. Thoracolumbar moment output ranged from 113 to 1281 Nm in the x-direction, 146 to 622 N in the y-direction, and 75 to 295 N in the z- direction. Simulation output is consistent with previously published literature and can be utilized to improve future modeling work. INTRODUCTION ANATOMICAL OVERVIEW The spine is composed of 33 vertebrae arranged in five regions: seven cervical, twelve thoracic, five lumbar, five sacral, and four coccygeal. As an axis to which the head, neck and limbs attach, the spine is both a rigid and flexible structure that protects the spinal cord, supports the weight of the body, and plays an essential role in human posture and locomotion1. When viewed laterally, the adult human spine has four naturally occurring curvatures that correlate with each region (Figure 1). The cervical and lumbar curvatures are convex anteriorly, whereas the thoracic and sacral curvatures are convex posteriorly. Under normal conditions, these spinal curvatures provide the body with a flexible, shock-absorbing support. Alteration of the curvatures is easily achieved through movements of the spine including flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation. In the automotive setting, spinal curvatures can change with varying seatback angles and this may cause increased stress in the thoracolumbar spine. Figure 1 . Human Spine Anatomy "Reprinted with permission from SAE Paper# 881331 © 1988 SAE International." The thoracolumbar spine is defined as the junction between the thoracic and lumbar regions. It begins at the level of T9 and continues to L1 . Each vertebral body in this region contains a core of spongy, trabecular bone surrounded by a thin layer of compact, cortical bone. Cartilaginous endplates are located on the superior and inferior surfaces of the vertebral body and are separated by intervertebral discs. Although these structures appear in each vertebra, they vary in size and shape based on the region at which they are located on the 1793</page><page sequence="2">spinal column. In the thoracic region, the vertebrae are heart shaped and have two facets on the transverse processes for articulation with the head of a rib. In the lumbar region, the vertebrae are massive and kidney shaped so they are capable of bearing more body weight compared to the thoracic region. The transition between thoracic and lumbar vertebrae is represented by the T12-L1 motion segment and has been identified as the most frequently injured spinal region2. White and Panjabi (1990) theorized that mechanical failure of the thoracolumbar region is caused by a stress concentration formed by the sudden change in stiffness properties between T12 and L1. High stiffness in this region results from the special orientation of the articulating facets. Facet joints act as a motion limiter in spinal extension because the inferior and superior articulating surfaces are almost vertical in the thoracolumbar spine. This change in facet orientation strongly influences the vertical load transmission through the joint. During flexion of the spine, the load is primarily transmitted through the anterior portion of the vertebral body and the articulating facets are stretched apart. In frontal impacts, compression-flexion loading of the thoracolumbar spine increases the risk of compression injuries. Compression fractures primarily involve a loss of vertebral body height with no posterior disruption. Examples of vertebral body compression injuries include burst, split, and wedge fractures (Figure 2). These fractures are caused by the transmission of an axial load through the vertebral body with or without a flexion component3. As shown in Figure 3A, a biconcave deformity occurs at the vertebral endplates if the compressive force is centrally located over the neutral axis of the vertebral body. If the loads are high enough, axial compression can cause a thoracolumbar burst fracture. In Figure 3B, a wedge fracture is caused by a high bending moment producing a compressive force in the anterior portion of the vertebral body 2. Both wedge and burst fractures are the predominant types of compression injuries observed in the thoracolumbar spine of Indianapolis-type racing car drivers during frontal impacts. MOTORSPORTS SAFETY RESEARCH OVERVIEW For many years, motorsports has provided a unique environment for injury biomechanists to study the crash forces acting on the driver. In 1994, the General Motors Motorsports Safety Technology Research Program (GM MSTRP) published anthropometric data of Indianapolis- type racing car drivers and defined them as 50th percentile males suggesting that the SAE 50th percentile, male crash test dummy is a valid anthropometric testing device (ATD) to assess the dynamic responses of Indianapolis-type racing car drivers4. Figure 2. Compression Fractures Figure 3. Endplate deformation (A), Wedge fracture (B) Utilizing the anthropometric data to study racing car restraint systems during frontal impacts, Melvin et al. (1994) performed 30 impact sled simulations with a 50th percentile, male Hybrid III ATD5. The authors reported particularly high lumbar compression loads in the 45- degree, reclined seating configuration but also found that the 30-degree, reclined seat exhibited lower lumbar compression loads. The lower lumbar compression loads in the 30-degree, reclined position are reported to be influenced by the use of horizontal shoulder belt anchor points. This study also stressed the influence of initial seating configuration of the race car driver on the loading produced during a crash. Melvin et al. (1994) also reported that the more upright the seating position of the driver, the less the loads because the restraint system can only produce maximum restraint when the belts are aligned with the direction of vehicle deceleration5. This condition is met sooner by an upright seating configuration compared to a 30- or 45- degree, reclined position. Interestingly enough, Indy car accident data did not identify lumbar spine injuries as significant at the time these data were reported. Beginning in 1993, Indy car crashes were investigated by the GM MSTRP using on-board impact recorders as the primary data collection tool6. This investigation led to the development of a database consisting of crash investigation reports including track and incident scene 1794</page><page sequence="3">information, vehicle damage, driver injuries, and vehicle decelerations measured by the on-board impact recorder. Expanding on this investigation, Melvin et al. (1998) published a biomechanical analysis of Indy car crashes and the specifications for implementing impact recorders in Indy car racing on a routine basis7. Both of these studies reported that vehicle deceleration recordings in real racing car crashes added immeasurably to the understanding of severe impacts and sparked developments to reduce driver injuries. But on occasion, severe injuries still occur. To further explore the cause of driver injuries and the tolerance of the human body to whole-body deceleration, crash conditions can be simulated using an instrumented ATD or mathematical modeling techniques. Using mathematical modeling techniques to predict injury potential to racing car drivers during crash events, Weerapuli et al. (1998) utilized the commercially available MADYM03D software to develop a CART car and driver model8. The 3-D crash pulse measured by the on-board impact recorder is the main input for the model, and specific body region accelerations, moments, and loads are the output. By comparing the model output with injury thresholds, a prediction of injury outcomes can be made for each real-world impact case. The CART driver model was validated by comparing the model predictions with actual head and neck injuries sustained by drivers in seven impacts from the 1997 CART season8. The authors concluded that the overall injury predictions of the model agreed with injuries reported in the corresponding medical records except in one case, the model over-predicted driver injuries. To improve biofidelity and more accurately predict the potential risk of driver head and neck injury, Weerapuli et al. (2002) enhanced the model and simulated 78 CART impacts9. The study showed that model predictions compared well with actual injuries and the authors further reported that the model can be used to evaluate countermeasures to improve racing car driver safety. Over the past decade, the number of thoracolumbar spinal fracture incidents among Indianapolis-type racing car drivers in the Indy Racing League10, Indy Pro Series (IPS), Championship Auto Racing Team (CART- now known as Champ Car), and Atlantic series has increased. Although considerable efforts have been made to understand the injury mechanisms of cervical spine injury and basilar skull fractures in the motorsports environment, little is known about the injury mechanism of thoracolumbar spine fractures in Indianapolis-type racing car drivers. A survey of motorsports crash reports indicates a total of 40 incidents of spinal injury between 1996 and 200611; 12. In these incidents, the thoracolumbar region (T9-L1) of the spine was the most frequently injured, with a total of 15 incidents. Seven of the thoracolumbar fracture cases occurred in the frontal direction and were identified as being of a higher injury severity as compared to rear impact cases. Therefore, the present study focuses on a biomechanical investigation of thoracolumbar spine fractures in Indianapolis-type racing car drivers during frontal impacts using driver medical records, crash reports, video, still photographic images, chassis accelerations from on-board data recorders and the analysis tool MADYMO to simulate crashes. The purpose of this study is to provide an understanding of driver kinematics, injury mechanisms and spinal loads causing thoracolumbar spinal fractures in Indianapolis-type racing car drivers during frontal impacts. METHODS A survey of Indianapolis-type racing car crash data was performed to identify the incidence of thoracolumbar spine injuries in Indianapolis-type racing car drivers. As shown in Figure 4, a total of forty incidents resulted in spinal injury between the 1996 and 2006 racing seasons for IRL, IPS, CART/Champ Car and Atlantics. According to Dr. Terry Trammell, orthopedic consultant to IRL and Champ Car, two drivers were each involved in two separate incidents yielding a total of thirty-eight drivers sustaining a spinal injury to at least one of the four spinal regions12. In the four professional motorsports series involved, the total number of spinal injuries in the last decade is greater than all previous years combined 12. Figure 4. Incidence of spinal injury by region The injury cases identified during the survey process were categorized by spinal region and direction of impact. Those cases involving thoracolumbar spine fractures and frontal impacts were further surveyed to obtain track and incident scene information, including video of the crash, still photographic images of vehicle damage, and chassis accelerations measured by the impact recorder. Driver medical records and x-rays confirmed the presence of a thoracolumbar spine fracture. The Comprehensive System, proposed by Gertzbein et al. (1992, 1999), was used to classify each thoracolumbar spine fracture31 13. A fracture severity index, developed by Trammell et al. (2006), graded the fractures from 1 to 6 according to the degree of deformity and extent of injury to the posterior column12. 1795</page><page sequence="4">The severity index is as follows: 1 : fracture without deformity (contusion) 2: 210% compression &lt;15° angulation 3: &gt;10% &lt;30% compression &gt;15° &lt;30° angulation 4: single endplate burst fracture with &gt;30% compression £30° angulation 5: double endplate burst fracture w / or w/o posterior column injury 6: fracture dislocation and/or cord injury. A second survey was performed, using the GM Motorsports database, to identify comparable frontal impact cases of high and low severity, occurring prior to 1996 and without significant driver injury. One high severity case was identified in which the driver sustained minor lacerations to the knee and elbow during a 62 G CART/USAC event in 1994. The lower severity case was previously published by Melvin et al. (1994) identifying a 42 G, CART impact, from 1994, resulting in no serious injuries to the driver, just sore muscles and ligament sprains5. Because these two impact events did not result in any serious driver injuries, they are classified as non-injury cases and used for comparison with the thoracolumbar spine injury cases. This led to the identification of seven appropriate cases, in which the driver experienced a frontal impact in an IRL, IPS, CART/USAC/Champ Car or Atlantics car between 1994 and 2006. The season range for the injury cases was limited to a four year time period because complete crash investigation reports were not available for previous years. Each of the seven cases were screened to remove driver identity and labeled with an alphabetical driver code. With the exception of Driver A, each impact was modeled separately and the predicted spinal responses were compared. The case of driver A is unique in that the car and driver sustained two significant frontal impacts. Initially, the car made heavy contact with the outside wall where the nosecone and wing were completely destroyed. Then, the car spun down across the track and the first chassis bulkhead made heavy contact with the inside wall. To understand which incident caused the injury, the two impacts were simulated and analyzed separately. A CART driver model previously developed by Weerappuli et al. (2005) was used in this study to predict thoracolumbar spine injury potential in Indianapolis-type racing car drivers81 9: 14; . Model simulations were performed using MADYM03D Version 5.4.1 with a run time ranging from one to two hours. The primary inputs for each simulation are the tri-axial chassis accelerations measured by the on-board crash recorders (Delphi Automotive Systems). The digitized crash pulses, shown in Appendix A, are typically sampled at 500 Hz and routinely filtered with a four-pole Butterworth filter at 100Hz. The MADYMO HYBRID-MI, 50th percentile, male dummy model represented the racing car driver. A six- point restraint system and HANS® device were modeled using the finite element option. The leg hump was adjusted rearward in order to tightly couple the car and driver as the case would be in the real world environment with a custom molded foam seat. Each driver was positioned in a 45-degree, reclined seating configuration. Figure 5 shows the initial position of the car and driver with external finite element features removed for better viewing of the occupant. Figure 5. Initial position of CART driver model RESULTS Table 1 provides a summary of both injury and non- injury, frontal impact cases by the year and motorsports series involved. In five real world crash events, drivers A through E sustained type A1 compression burst fractures with wedging characteristics, at levels T9 to L1 of the thoracolumbar spine3: 11: 13. Using the severity index outlined in the Methods section, these frontal impact cases were of the highest severity with grade 5 and 6 injuries12. The most severe fractures, observed in drivers A and D, had a significant flexion moment that was represented by the distractive posterior element and ligamentous injuries clearly visible in driver x-rays. Appendix B contains radiographic images of each driver's thoracolumbar spine injury.

Summary of Crash Investigation Data The model output of thoracolumbar spine forces and moments were measured at the Hybrid III dummy upper lumbar load cell. Initial simulations of drivers B, C, D and F showed unrealistic driver kinematics and excessive vertical spine loads, so the chassis z- acceleration was removed from the model input. This condition is further addressed in the Discussion section. Table 3 represents a summary of peak thoracolumbar spine forces and moments in the longitudinal (x), lateral (y) and vertical (z) direction for each simulation case. Model output shows the highest thoracolumbar forces in the vertical direction for all cases, while the moment output is variable between cases.

Summary of peak forces (F) and moments (M) for each simulation case * Denotes simulation without vertical input component For the five injury cases, thoracolumbar forces range from 683 to 4547 N in the x-direction, 475 to 6623 N in the y-direction, and 4825 to 13,211 N in the z-direction. The high severity, non-injury case (driver F) showed higher thoracolumbar forces compared to the low severity, non-injury case of Driver G. Contrary to the force trend, moments were not high in any one particular direction. For the five injury cases, thoracolumbar moments range from 113 to 1281 Nm in the x-direction, 146 to 622 N in the y-direction, and 75 to 295 N in the z- direction. Similar to the thoracolumbar forces, the high severity, non-injury case (Driver F) showed higher thoracolumbar moments compared to the low severity, non-injury case of Driver G. In some directions, the non- injury cases predicted higher forces and moments compared to the injury cases but in other directions, the opposite was apparent. DISCUSSION Driver kinematics predicted by the model show initial forward motion of the driver's lower body into the leg hump followed by torso restraint from the 6-point belt system. The pelvic region and posterior aspect of the driver's upper legs, contacts the steeply inclined, leg hump before the torso is restrained by the belt system. Once the torso is restrained, the driver's body flexes forward about the lap belt, indicating stretch in the belt system. After the forward motion is arrested by the restraint system, the driver's body extends and returns to the initial seating position. Video analysis of the actual crash events could not confirm this kinematic behavior because the racing cars, in these cases, were not instrumented with on-board cameras. Video analysis and still images could only confirm the point of contact, contact structure, and resulting car damage. Because injury tolerance is dependent on several factors including the type of restraint system, age of the driver/occupant, configuration of the spine in the seating position, and direction of impact, it is difficult to arrive at a specific set of injury criteria for the thoracolumbar spine16. High speed burst fractures are theorized to occur in the thoracolumbar region as a direct load is applied over the vertebral body, causing the endplate to fail first followed by the vertebral body2: 17: 18. As the endplate and vertebral body failure loads increase, so too does the loading rate. This injury mechanism applies a large axial load to the vertebral body, causing compression, and yields a loss of vertebral height. King et al. (2002) postulates that this injury mechanism causes the vertebral body to break up into multiple segments, jeopardizing the spinal cord as the segments may move posteriorly into the spinal canal and cause a spinal cord lesion16. Severing the spinal cord in the thoracolumbar region can ultimately lead to paraplegia, an inability to move the lower body. As a link between the torso and lower extremities, the thoracolumbar spine is responsible for transferring power through the kinetic chain. The stability of the spinal column can be characterized by the lordotic curvature of the lumbar vertebrae, and we theorize that this curvature is compromised in Indianapolis-type 1797</page><page sequence="6">racing car drivers due to the occupant's seating position in the existing molded foam seats. Therefore, the risk of spinal injury in the thoracolumbar vertebrae is thought to be related to the spinal curvature as a function of the applied load and flexion moment. Such loading can lead to compression type fractures of the thoracolumbar vertebrae accompanied by neurological damage and spinal cord injury from fragments of bone that have separated from the vertebral body. The proposed injury mechanism for burst fractures is based on White et al., (1990) where compression in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions is caused by a significant vertical load applied by an axial force, or by a flexion moment, or a combination of the two2. The most severe compression fractures are caused by a significant flexion moment yielding disruption of the posterior element and ligamentous structures2. A level T12 complete burst fracture is clearly visible in the radiographic image of driver C whereas a more severe T9 burst fracture with posterior disruption is visible in the radiographic image of driver A. Biomechanical analysis of driver radiographic images suggests the proposed injury mechanism by White et al. (1990) is applicable to the thoracolumbar spine fractures observed in the Indianapolis-type racing car environment. Because thoracolumbar spine injuries are relatively infrequent in passenger car impacts, biomechanical research in this area is not as advanced as that of the cervical spine and head as they relate to whiplash or brain injury. The thoracolumbar spine tolerance literature reports a broad range of compressive forces capable of producing vertebral body failures. Yoganandan et al. (1988) performed a biomechanical investigation of the human thoracolumbar spine using cadavers and a Hybrid II anthropomorphic manikin to establish the limits of tolerance and explain the mechanism of failure18. The authors used isolated human male vertebral bodies to study the uni-axial failure strength in compression and reported force at failure for the thoracic and lumbar regions. The thoracic region (T7-T12) had a failure load of 3264 ± 1211 N. The lumbar region (L1-L5) had a failure load of 4590 ± 2061 N18. This data suggests a force to failure range for isolated vertebral bodies from levels T7-L5 of 2053 to 6651 N. The study by Yoganandan et al. (1988) also reported on compression-flexion loading failure in the thoracolumbar spine using intact human male cadavers in the seated position with the pelvis restrained by a lap belt. Axial forces were applied by an actuator device to the T2-T3 region of the spine using a square plate. The outcomes of this type of loading caused wedging fractures from T7-L1, with the majority of fractures occurring at T9 and L12. The failure loads ranged from 556 to 5560 N18. For the manikin study, a tri-axial accelerometer was mounted in the lumbar spine region, and three impacts were performed by dropping the manikin from a vertical height of 400 mm so that the buttocks contacted the force plate surface. In the first two impacts, the manikin's buttocks landed vertically on the force plate, yielding a resultant force of 9391.7 N and 9236.5 N, respectively. In the third impact, the dorsal aspect of the manikin's buttocks contacted the force plate, yielding a resultant force of 11,444.7 N. Based on this data, the lumbar spine resultant loads are overestimated by the Hybrid II manikin. In the present study, the thoracolumbar spine forces of the MADYMO Hybrid III, 50th percentile, male dummy ranged from 4996 to 13,211 N in the z-direction. After considering the Yoganandan et al. (1988) data and comparing the dummy output from this study, we conclude that the MADYMO 50th percentile, male, Hybrid III dummy also overestimates thoracolumbar spine loads. This conclusion is further supported in the motorsports environment by Melvin et al. sled test data5. In a 42 G, sled test using a Hybrid III, 50th percentile, male dummy positioned in a 45-degree, reclined seating configuration, wearing racing restraints and a HANS® neck support, the lumbar spine compression load was 13,500 N. In the present study, three simulations (cases A1, A2 and D) produced thoracolumbar loads exceeding 10,500 N. Interestingly, these cases correlate with the most severe driver injuries. It remains unclear as to why the non- injury cases predicted higher forces and moments in some directions compared to the injury cases but in other directions, the opposite was apparent. This could result from the limitations of the Hybrid III dummy, the mounting location of the on-board impact recorder, or a combination of the two. The MADYMO, Hybrid III 50th percentile male dummy ellipsoid model proved to be a limiting factor in the determination of spinal loads, driver kinematics, and injury mechanisms. Due to the ellipsoidal construction of the dummy spine, only upper lumbar loads and moments could be measured to predict thoracolumbar spine injury. The Hybrid III dummy also lacks biofidelity, which limits the ability to compare driver kinematics from the model to real world cases using video and still photographic images. Given that the Hybrid III dummy model does not have a multi-segmented vertebral column, spine injury mechanisms, under these conditions, cannot be fully understood. The impact causing injury to driver A remains unclear based on the model predictions. Due to these limitations, we cannot definitively identify the precise cause of thoracolumbar spine fractures in Indianapolis-type racing car drivers using the current model. The chassis accelerations collected by the on-board data recorders were initially drawn into question when an oscillatory nature was identified about the longitudinal axis (x) in cases A1, C, and D and high vertical components were evident in cases B, C, D, and F. During preliminary simulations, it was also discovered that excessive, unrealistic vertical thoracolumbar spine loads and unusual driver kinematics were predicted. This led to an investigation of the impact recorder placement in the car. This phenomenon of high vertical accelerations is theorized to be an erroneous result from a combination of chassis buckling and the mounting location of the data recorder in the car. The data 1798</page><page sequence="7">recorder is typically mounted anterior to the first bulkhead, and video from full-scale Indy-type car impact testing visually shows chassis buckling in this area12. These observations subsequently lead to the removal of the z-acceleration from the model input for cases B, C, D, and F. When the z-acceleration was removed, driver kinematics and spine loads became more realistic. However, the ability to accurately measure chassis accelerations using the on-board impact recorder, as it is mounted in the current location, requires further investigation. Driver height, foam seat construction, and head and neck restraint systems vary by driver. In this study, specific anthropometry and seating measurements were not recorded for each case. The Indianapolis-type racing car driver anthropometry was generalized to be a 50th percentile, male based on anthropomorphic data published by Andrzejak et at. It remains unclear as to which head and neck restraint system the driver was wearing at the time the impact occurred and it is unknown as to what type of seat was being used. This information could play a critical role in predicting the injury mechanisms of thoracolumbar spine fracture. For the purposes of this study, each driver was modeled wearing a HANS® device. To improve future biomechanical investigations of these cases, each driver's anthropometry, seating configuration, seat type, and head and neck restraint system should be taken into consideration. CONCLUSIONS The current study provides a glimpse into the injury tolerances of living human beings during frontal impacts in the motorsports environment. The driver kinematics, injury mechanisms, and spinal loads necessary to create thoracolumbar fractures in Indianapolis-type racing car drivers were investigated using the analysis tool MADYM03D. This mathematical method was used to predict injury potential by simulating actual racing car crashes using the tri-axial chassis accelerations from the on-board crash data recorders. Although the present data does not conclusively predict failure loads of individual vertebrae, high thoracolumbar spine forces indicate the potential for type A1 compression burst fractures. Given the injury severity and potential for paralysis, thoracolumbar spine fractures continue to be of great concern in the Indianapolis-type racing car environment and thus require further investigation. Future research should involve the use of a validated, biofidelic mathematical model, with a multi-segmented vertebral column, to predict thoracolumbar spine injury potential using on-board crash recordings from injury and non-injury cases. By combining actual injury data from real-world cases with model predictions, injury biomechanists can gain a better understanding of thoracolumbar spine responses under dynamic loading conditions. To further understand the relationship between spinal configuration and seating position, it is important to perform a parametric study on these conditions in the Indianapolis-type racing car environment. Longitudinal studies are necessary to observe the effect of potential confounding factors such as modifications to foam seats and chassis design changes over the years.
