<plain_text><page sequence="1">The simian tongue: The long debate about animal language. By Gregory Radick. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007. Pp. xiv, 577. ISBN 9780226702247. $45 (Hb). Reviewed by Robbins Burling, University of Michigan Gregory Radick's thoughtful and gracefully written book is, at its most explicit (and most su- perficial) level, a history of playback experiments in the study of animal vocal communication, and of the implications of these experiments for our understanding of the evolution of the human capacity for language. Early chapters tell the astonishing story of an American named Richard Garner, who in the 1890s actually carried out playback experiments with captive apes, using an early phonograph equipped with wax cylinders. He even launched an expedition to West Africa where he hoped (but failed) to play recordings back to wild chimpanzees and gorillas, so as to learn to understand the meaning and use of their calls. The book ends, except for a brief conclud- ing chapter, with a detailed account of the famous playback experiments of Dorothy Cheney and Robert Seyfarth that showed how vervet monkeys are warned of eagles, pythons, and leopards by the contrasting calls of other vervets. Before and between these two bracketing sections, R makes occasional references to playbacks, but he also ventures into a wide range of topics that bear, in some way, on playbacks, but that have at least as much interest in their own right. At times, the topic of playbacks seems almost forgotten, but the result is a rich history of the struggle to under- stand language in a Darwinian framework. One topic that R bumps up against repeatedly, but addresses directly and in a general way only in the very last section of his book, is the conflict between gradualist and saltationist (or 'cata- strophist') views of evolution. From Darwin's time, language has always been a problem for gradualists. Everyone has recognized that it is language, more than anything else, that sets hu- mans apart from the apes, but constructing a gradualist scenario for getting from apes that have no language to humans who are drenched with it has been so difficult that saltationist theories have always been a temptation. R reviews the intense nineteenth-century debate when, from one side,</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 245 Max Müller scoffed at gradualist attempts to find anticipations of language in animal calls, while, from the other side, people like William Dwight Whitney poured scorn back on Müller. Darwin himself avoided the public debate, but his notebooks show that he recognized the language gap very clearly but thought it could be overcome. By the end of the nineteenth century, Müller' s po- sition had effectively won, and speculation about how the capacity for language might have evolved lost its respectability among serious scholars. Outside the mainstream, however, gradualism lived on, and Richard Garner and his wax cylin- ders make their appearance in Ch. 3. Garner had no academic training or affiliation, but he was an energetic amateur, an adept showman, and a skillful self-publicist. He lectured to enthusiastic au- diences, wrote widely for the popular press, and allowed himself to be called 'Dr. Garner' or 'Pro- fessor Garner' . He expected to be able to demonstrate that apes have a primitive vocal language. Like many of his contemporaries, he presumed that the languages of the 'savages' (as they were then called) were far less developed than the languages of more advanced 'races', so he expected to find a continuum that led from lower animals, by way of the primates and then the savages, all the way to the languages of the most civilized people. Garner set up his phonograph at New York's Central Park zoological garden and he recorded, and even played back, primate calls. His experiments attracted considerable popular attention, and he then undertook an expedition to West Africa, where he planned to record and play back the calls of apes in their native habitat and, in that way, to discover 'the simian tongue'. He consulted with Thomas Edison about modifications to the phonograph to make it a more useful tool in the field. He assembled equipment including a large metal cage in which he proposed to live while safely observing the animals from the inside, and he set off for Gabon in a considerable flurry of publicity. Unfortunately, his efforts to take a phonograph failed, so his goals were undermined from the start, and he also seems to have made enemies of some Catholic missionaries. After his return to Britain and then to America, lurid stories of his activities in Africa began to circulate. R sifts through the claims and counterclaims and concludes with a sympathetic view of Garner's trip, suggesting that he may have been the victim of both clerical prejudice and muckraking jour- nalism. He survived the scandals, however, and continued to write and lecture. He even made sev- eral later trips to Africa, but he never regained his earlier fame. Garner's story is a fascinating one - both funny and tragic. R tells the story well, but he does not quite manage to fit it in com- fortably with the intellectual history that he covers so well in the chapters that precede and follow. After focusing on Garner, R returns to the more academic side of the story, even while doing his best to relate it to Garner's work. He gives an excellent account of the new orientation that Franz Boas brought to anthropology. Boas turned evolution over to the physical anthropologists and effectively outlawed the notion that western cultures represent any sort of pinnacle on an evo- lutionary ladder. It became difficult for anthropologists, including those, like Alfred Kroeber and Edward Sapir, who doubled as linguists, to consider the evolution of the capacity for language. The language gap looked so wide that it became almost indecent to try to peer across it. Mean- while, the rise of behavioral psychology discouraged any hint of anthropomorphism or of the gradualism that anthropomorphism implied. But gradualism would not stay dead. By the end of the 1920s Robert Yerkes was able to start his experiments on chimpanzees, and instead of being limited to trial and error, his apes began to show 'insight' by figuring out how to stack boxes so as to climb up and get the bananas. Winthrop and Luella Kellogg raised a baby chimp for nine months along with their own child, and they re- ported much human-like behavior in the chimpanzee. Charles Carpenter went to Thailand to study gibbons in the wild. In Europe, Niko Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz rebelled at the limita- tions of American behaviorism with its B. F. Skinner boxes and its focus on learning by trial and error, and they began to study animals in their natural conditions. They wanted to understand an- imal behavior for itself, not just as a pale and imperfect anticipation of human behavior. R then reviews the wartime and early post-war development of information theory, especially by Claude Shannon and Norbert Wiener in the United States, and he describes the development of the oscilloscope and sound spectrograph, which, along with ever better recording and playback equipment, opened new ways to study both animal calls and human communication. Better</page><page sequence="3">246 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 86, NUMBER 1 (20 1 0) equipment contributed to a blossoming of interest in bird songs, and R reviews the rapidly devel- oping study of bird communication, focusing on the career of Peter Marier, first in England and later in the United States. Marier pioneered playback studies with birdsongs, and later used simi- lar techniques to study primate communication; he encouraged Seyfarth and Cheney to work with vervets. R then turns to linguistics with a careful account of Charles Hockett's famous 'design fea- tures'. Hockett's approach was an explicitly gradualist one. He saw the design features (such as duality of patterning, productivity, arbitrariness) as being added step by step on the way to lan- guage. R also describes another burgeoning set of gradualist experiments: the enthusiastic at- tempts to teach either natural or artificial languages to apes, most often chimpanzees - Keith and Catherine Hayes with Viki, David Premack with Sarah, Allen and Beatrice Garner with Washo, and Herbert Terrace with Nim Chimpsky. Oddly, he makes no mention of Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and Kanzi. In the penultimate chapter, R returns to playback experiments with a detailed account of Cheney and Seyfarth's study of vervet alarm calls. By this time ethology was being heavily influenced by the sociobiological ideas of William D. Hamilton, Robert Trivers, and others, but oddly, in view of his otherwise wide survey, R discusses sociobiology only briefly, and only in its earliest manifes- tations. For Seyfarth and Cheney's work, however, R not only viewed the published literature, but also interviewed the principals and was given access to their unpublished records. He tells the story well. The playback experiments with the vervets demonstrated, as nothing had so clearly demon- strated before, that different calls led the monkeys to take different defensive maneuvers. We could no longer doubt that some primates convey environmental information to conspecifics by means of contrasting vocalizations. Some enthusiastic readers, eager for signs of gradualism, and less cau- tious than the experimenters themselves, leapt to the conclusion that the vervet alarm calls were names for leopards, hawks, and pythons. The vervets became the favorite example for anyone who wanted to stress the evolutionary continuities between animal and human communication. With Hockett in linguistics and the widely publicized studies of both captive and wild primate communication, gradualism had a good run, but no more than gradualism would saltationism die, and in his brief concluding chapter R does, at last, focus directly on the enduring tension between saltationist and gradualist views. A reader can almost imagine R looking over a late draft of his work and wondering why he had not made more of this topic. He now brings the saltationist views to the front by pointing to the extreme saltationism of the linguist Horatio Hale in the late nineteenth century, to the saltationist implications of Boas in anthropology, of the behaviorists in psychology, of Stephen Jay Gould's punctuated equilibrium in biology, and to the explicitly salta- tionist position of linguists such as Derek Bickerton in his Language and species (1990). Linguists, indeed, have a weakness for saltationist views. Perhaps R wrote too late to include the most radical saltationist theory of all, that of Häuser, Chomsky, and Fitch (2002), who pro- pose that the single critical step of syntactic recursion marked the advent of language (see also Fitch et al. 2005, Jackendoff &amp; Pinker 2005, Pinker &amp; Jackendoff 2005). That proposal might never have been taken seriously had it not come with Chomsky's name attached, but it has given comfort to linguists who want to see language, and human beings who use language, as unique. Every time someone takes seriously the question 'When did language begin?', a datable saltation is presumed, for the question glosses over the likelihood of a very long period during which the capacity for language very gradually approached its modern form. R deals well with an enormous range of intellectual history from many diverse disciplines: bi- ological and cultural anthropology, ethology, primatology, psychology, information theory, neu- roscience, and linguistics. He displays a deep knowledge of the issues that have both united and divided the scientists who have worked in all these areas. He has, moreover, given us a very good read. I recommend the book warmly. REFERENCES Bickerton, Derek. 1990. Language and species. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Fitch, W. Tecumseh; Marc D. Häuser; and Noam Chomsky. 2005.
