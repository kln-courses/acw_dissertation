<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN CATHOLIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW The Use of Analogical Conceltualization In Sociology JOSEPH F. SCHEUER, C. PP. S. T IHE PROBLEM OF TERMINOLOGY and definitions in any science is of critical importance. Likewise, the definition of the science it- self - the field or area of phenomena with which it is concerned as wel as the special viewpoint, frame of reference, or "formal object' of the science must be clearly stated or confusion will be the chief fruit of all en- deavor. This is easily accepted, and to insist upon the theoretical ideal of 'science' would only lay one open to the charge of being an apostle of the obvious. Yet, in the science of sociology there is nowhere, it seems, a clearly stated, or anywhere near generally accepted order of terminological defini- tion, nor is the problem or question clearly and universally answered: "What is sociology?" To a serious beginner and inquirer in this science it sometimes may appear as a slightly exaggerated paradox that there is no science of sociology but only a large group of sociologists and that the phenomenon is the result of infiltration into intellectual life of that American individualism which is so glaring in economics and politics. All this may be expected as the normal concomitant to the adolescence of a science. But from another viewpoint, such an explanation, too, is unacceptable and altogether facile. It may be merely writing blank checks on the future. The problem of definition and the "direction" which sociology is to take already has deep historical roots. Comte conceived of sociology as "soc- ial physics," capable of finding and demonstrating the "laws" which govern social phenomena, as "natural laws" govern the phenomena of the natural sciences.1 Again, Durkheim assumed sociology to be that body of science, proceeding by induction, which deals with "social reality" further assuming 1.

The fact that either or any one of these may be the beginning of paths lead- ing far from one another becomes very clear when conclusions are approach- ed and especially when sociology turns from science to art for practical con- siderations and application. In the course of sociology's evolution from Comte to the contemporaries, three courses have emerged - three "types" of sociology have their devotees and defenders. first, the historico-philosophical group which emphasizes cultural traditions as "explanations" of and justification for the social phen- omena of today, second, the factor-situation school which plays upon the correlations between economic, geographical and political factors and social phenomena. Finally, and most recently, the structure-analytic school, be- traying strong affinity and sympathy with psychological and psychiatric con- cepts in an attempt to understand and "see," totally or in part, social phen- omena as "structure," change of "structure," or conflict and genialty of "structure." To each of these three lines of sociological thought reference will be made more fuly below. Important to note here is the fact that each of these trends has its own more or less characteristic "line" of terminology or concepts which are ad- vanced to handle the data of observation. It is a truism to say that adequate conceptualiztion is necessary in any scientific study. However, the validity of concepts in any of these various "sociologies" is a sore problem which some scientific methodologists attempt to evade with the claim that con- cpts are merely "tools," making no demands that they measure up pre- cisely to any actual thing (data, phenomenon).3 This is an error as ancient as man's history. Nominalism is of no help to science, for if tools (concepts) have no actual content of reality, then sociology gives no knowledge of the actual social universe. On the contrary it is mere verbal illusion, giving no guarantee of a rapprochement of the mind to the worth, which rapproche- ment is another name for truth. Concepts in physics and biology, to take but two of the natural sciences, are certainly not merely tools." In physics the concept "ether" represents a 2. cf. Simon Deploige, The Conflict Between Ethics and Sociology, St. Louis, B. Herder Book Co., 1938, Chapter V. 108</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN CATHOLIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW given reality (something existing outside the mind) whose existence is posited to account for the transmission of light through space, or as the intervening factor accounting for the discreteness of sub-atomic particles. However "true" this may be as physics theory the fact remains that "ether" in the mind of the physicist corresponds to a real thing outside of his mind. In biology, protoplasm, cells, tissue, all these are concepts which have objective signi- ficance. They are objectively valid, which means that they make it possible for the human mind to lay hold of things in the extra-mental world. And when the mind so lays hold of things the mind is spoken of as having truth, or knowledge, or "being informed." Truth becomes, therefore, but the rap- prochement of the mind to reality by means of adequate concepts. When a body of such concepts is built up or "ordered," so that it is not just a scattering of hollow verbiage, but on the contrary serves to make the interrelatedness of things (given phenomena) apparent to the mind, such an ordering is called a science. All this is quite readily evident in the case of natural science, physics, biology, chemistry, geology, mathematics and allied areas. As a matter of historical record they triumphed during the 18th and 19th century precisely because their concepts measured up to reality and through these concepts the minds of men were able to wield and direct reality into combinations of "applied science," into technology, into medicine, into a hundred related fields, giving to mankind an advance of health and wealth never before ex- perienced. It was under the enthusiasm for science which these advances created that social science had its beginning. Procedures so successful in physical science, concepts measuring up to reality here, and in a sense, enabling men to control nature, were assumed possible of exerting the same control if applied to the realm of human behavior. Hence the transfer of empirical method and the concepts derived from its influence (largely but not ex- clusively) into the ream of social phenomena with the conscious or un- conscious expectation that equal success would follow in controlling matters of a social nature, crime, delinquency, revolution, war.3 3. Nicholas Timasheff, "Definitions in the Social Sciences," American Journal of Sociology, Vol. LIII, Nov. 1947. 109</page><page sequence="4">110 AMERICAN CATHOLIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW Transference or Reduction There is little room to doubt the fact of this transference. An exhaustive demonstration has no point here, but initially it would seem that sociology has borrowed almost without exception its terminology and conceptual schemes from some one or combination of physical sciences. All terms like frame of reference,4 polarity, mobility, distance, periodicity, incidence, focus, ecology, gravity, character, pattern, cell, cycle, organism, evolution, struc- ture, area, institution, have been taken from physics, biology, most lately from psychology following Freud, and with the prefix "social" used to build a science of sociology. Scientists cannot be denied their right of adapting after borrowing their concepts, nor are there limitations as to where they may borrow them. But here our problem becomes perhaps clearest: what is the validity of these con- cepts in their new context? More often than not, perhaps, they are valid in physics, biology, chemistry. But an added problem arises when they are taken from psychology, a field in which few concepts are crystallized suf- ficiently for universal use; borrowing from this science is simply borrowing more uncertainty for sociology.5 Perhaps the point of inquiry will be still more pointed from this ques- tion: does it follow that because distance between two objects (in physics) can be measured in feet and inches, that there is such a thing as social distance to be measured in terms of attitudes, or in terms of income as between upper and lower classes? If this is assumed to be useful and studies made upon the assumption follow, do these studies have and deserve credit as science in the same sense as research in the physical sciences and they are giving the human mind the same kind of knowledge and certainty as the physical sciences? Again, because biologically an organism is structured, that is, it has cells, tissues, organs placed one outside the other in an orderly fashion (hierarch- ically) is it valid and permissible (in the name of scence) to speak of society as structured? Or is this reading into social phenomena, transferring into 4. For an interesting use of this particular term admittedly from physics but used in a social psychological context cf., Muzafer Sheriff, The Psychology of Social Norms, New York, Harper and Brothers, 1940, ch. III. 5. Some indications of the shortcomings of this borrowing are plainly stated by Abram Kardiner, "The Concept of Basic Personality Structure as an Operational Tool in the Social Sciences," in The Scielnce of Man in the World Crisis, edited by Ralph Linton, New York, Columbia University Press, 1945.</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN CATHOLIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW the realm of social science, preconceptions of a biological origin and nature? If it is alleged that the terms are used with reservations and with proper adjustment then inquiry must be made and explicit criteria established up- on which the transference is made. For it is quite conceivable and under- standable that not every concept is useful when transferred; the point may seem obvious but to establish why is not. These difficulties are brought into even sharper focus when terms from psychology are transferred and sociology is reduced to its fundamental pos- tulates. Cases in point are such terms as "ego ideal," "personality structure," "role," "status," "behavior pattern." Even in their original (psychological) contexts they are not clear, precise, and assuredly adequate. Again the origin of the last three in particular, and the "definitions" given to them by Ralph Linton and Ruth Benedict in particular, are heavily loaded with Freudian preconceptions. Seldom is there any attempt at logical definition (genus and species), but only description of what is sometimes meant in the use of terms. In fact, one lays himself open to charges of "metaphysical mysticism" if he insists upon clear definition. Further, this psychological school is internally divided between the strict followers of Freud, the followers of Adler, and most lately the group following Karen Homey, Eric Fromm, and Abram Kardiner, injecting strong cultural determinism into interpretations of Freud. If sociology borrows univocally from such precarious (it matters little how popular they might be) positions as these, is it not indeed treading dangerous grounds and jeapordizing its own repute and autonomy? Yet, as precarious as this transfer or reduction of the terms of one science into another science might be, as dangerous as it might be for a social science to analyze its data and proceed "in terms of" this or that, nothing is more common. It is particularly dangerous and precarious because terms may or may not have validity permanently in a given field of origin, and when transferred to another field completely change, be inadequate, and nev- er-the-less enjoy a certain acceptance and pseudo-validity because of a real or alleged success in nother field. Sociology then comes to have validity not in its own right, but by ascription. This statement of the problem might seem very negative and destruc- tive. There is another side, however, which must be developed. It does seem possible to explain many of these difficulties and to work toward a very 11I</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN CATHOLIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW wide and useful range of concepts in sociology on this theoretical level once the meaning and consequence of a theory of analogy are made clear. Once the validity and scope of analogical conceptualization is admitted, a firm basis and a certain clarity appear in the concepts of these schools. More important, certain extensions of sociological investigation become legitimate and profitable upon the same theoretical basis. The Nature of Analogy6 Scientific writing, consciously or unconsciously, uses concepts vety often in different ways, with logical comprehension and extension differing ever so slightly. One who follows with inattention the context of these concepts, which gives the clue to shifts, might easily lose contact with the writer's meaning, or draw conclusions and inferences which are not intended. When, however, a physicist speaks of force, he may mean the force of water, electricity, or the force of a falling rock. Note though, while there are three manifestations of force, in each case the concept force itself has the same basic meaning, the same significance; this is to say that the same reality is spoken of exactly, though it may be generated by water, by a dy- namo, or by a rock falling. Always the meaning of force is the same; the term is being used to enable the mind to grasp the same fundamental thing manifested in varying media. This is the univocal use of the concept. Similarly, a biologist uses the term organism, referring to an amoeba or to a very highly integrated object such as a man's body. In all cases the term relates the mind to the same fundamental reality, cells, tissues, organs, built or placed into a living, functional unit. The term is used to mean always this same organization univocally. There is another way of using terms or concepts, not for scientific pur- poses, (if science does use this means it is clearly invalid), which is totally opposite. This is equivocation - double-talk. It is really quite obvious that a double-meaning use of concepts in scientific writing is inadmissible since equivocation gves no rational, consistent approach to reality (truth). Thus, an extreme example, if an ornithologist studying pigeons actually gives data concerning, and means by that term, a chorus girl, he is obviously not dealing with a subject relevant to his field. Similarly, the concepts "mine" 6. It should be quite clear from the context that analogical conceptualization and the argument from analogy are by no means identical. The latter is no concern of this paper, since its validity and limitatinos follow the very nature of analogy itself which is of primary concern. 112</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN CATHOLIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW (origin of coal) and "mine" (possessive pronoun) are equivocal. While the term is exactly the same in equivocation, the significance is totally different. The third use of concepts, by analogy, has the greatest relevance for social science and the problem posed. Two possibilities are present in the use of analogy. Analogy of Attribution In common speech, the anchor is the sign of hope; a dove, the sign of peace; the blinded goddess the sign of justice. All these are examples of the analogy of attribution. Anchor, in the first example is a concept applicable to any number of singular, individual items, similarly, hope is applicable to many singular acts, emotional manifestations, which are named or represented under that term. Whence, then, the association of anchor to hope in the minds of men ? Certainly, by taking a cold empiric look at an anchor and at the same time at an individual man hoping, one would not establish a test-tube con- nection between the two. Yet, commonly, men attribute qualities, sense per- ceptible (hence empiric), of an anchor to at least some qualities of an act of hope. The mind sees or intuits the likeness, the similarity of these sense- data, and attributes the qualities of one object to another, thereby mentally establishing a relationship. This is not merely mental construct; there is an extra-mental, real, ob- jective basis, namely: the sense perceptible data or phenomena. Hence, through the analogy of attribution something new is known. If the mind were capable of seeing only the qualities of "stability" in the anchor, and "stability" only in an act of hope, separately, but not the interrelatedness of the two, something would be lacking, particularly in men's artistic leanings. Barren indeed would be much of mankind's appreciation and knowledge of things were these interrelations totally without significance. The precise basis for the mind making the connection, or noting the similarity (relationship) is outside the mind itself, namely, the fact of sta- bility in both analogues. Hence, the knowledge by such analogy is factual, real. A certain "truth" is attained in that the mind is in rapport with things. Analogy of Proportionality An easily evident description of the function of this kind of proportion- ality in the use of concepts is the term "king" as applied to the ruler of a 113</page><page sequence="8">114 AMERICAN CATHOLIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW realm, and a lion. Zoologists may dispute the popular saying that a lion is "king of the jungle," but this is merely to dispute whether or not a lion de- serves, in the popular estimation, his proportion of kingship.7 The propor- tion can be visualized in a fashion mathematically: A : B equals A' : B' where A is the man and B his realm of men, and A' the lion and B' his realm of the jungle. Important here is the fact that not only does the mind make (attribute) the relationship. Lions rule jungles as a king does his realm whether the mind intuits the fact or not, whereas in the analogy of attribu- tion, the mind creates, so to speak, the relationship between hope and anchor: the relationship does not exist totally independent of the mind. In propor- tionality, the relationships already exist in the objects and because it exists the mind "sees' but does not "create.' It is the relationship of proportion which the mind gathers, not merely the qualities in the analogue upon which the mind constructs the relationship. Which of these two types of analogy are used so extensively in socio- logy is of great importance, but in another context. It is sufficient for the purposes of the initial problem to establish that sociological concepts are simple analogies, and not the univocal terms found in physical science. Specific Indications of Analogical Conceptualization in Sociology Unfortunately, analogy has a manner of creeping into human thoughts almost unnoticed, and conclusions reached by means of arguments based upon the analogy all too easily, consciously or unconsciously, follow. In a section above, brief notice was given to a whole group of sociologists 7. Should a Zoologist completely demonstrate the falsity of this popular analogy it would be a fine example of what happens so often in sociological controversy - the breakdown of a supposed analogy in the course of time and close study. "The success and prestige of the bio- logical sciences since Warwin's day led many, if not most, social scientists to equate human behavior with that of the lower animals and to explain social institutions as the expression of a series of universal instincts. Marriage was equated with animal mating, housebuilding with nesting behavior, government with rule of the herd by the strongest male. The marked parallels between the social behavior of ant, bees, wasps, and termites and the cultural behavior of man appeared especially convincing. However, the progress of science began to show increasingly the importance of learning habits . . . (and) demonstrated beyond possibility of rebuttal that human behavior shows infinite variation from society to society and perpetual change in any one society as it exists through time, instead of the identity and persistency demanded by an instinct theory." George Murdock, "The Common Denominator of Cultures" in The Science of Man in the World Crisis, edited by Ralph Linton, New York, Columbia University Press, 1945. p. 126.</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN CATHOLIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW 1 classified there as "the factor-situation school." More often, perhaps, this group is spoken of as the Ecological School. Among them the names Lund- berg, Burgess,8 McKenzie,9 Queen and Thomas,io are but a few of the out- standing. The chief endeavor here seems to be the understanding of human relationships in terms of environment, particularly geographical and econom- ic. They speak of individuals as niched," in society. Again, they speak of centers of gravity, and chart these, using carefully constructed isometric maps.'2 Lack of space makes it imperative to refrain from further reference to their concepts. But even from these the assumption is quite clear: just as in botany (plant ecology) a certain correlation exists between a plant and its environment, so also with men, both as individuals and as social groups. (One would not expect a palm tree to grow in the Arctic, nor, analogously, would one expect an Eskimo culture to flourish in the Sahara). Is this not plainly the use of conceptualization by analogy, just as, and with equal proportion here, the concept "king" is applied to the lion? A second group of social scientists already referred to above is the culture-tradition or historico-philosophical school. Here, analogical con- ceptualization takes a slightly different turn. While this group13 does not emphasize the use of physical science terminology, it does not necessarily and absolutely avoid it. The writings common and typical of this group, rather stress the analogical positions (using heaps of empirical evidence to substantiate the analogy) of various cultures, their inter-relations and inter- actions in the historical time continuum.14 As an example of this, Sorokin's 8. cf.

Some men and works not mentioned in the text but belonging to this group of sociologists are: Oswald Spengler, The Decline of the West, authorized translation by Charles Atkinson, New York, A. Knof, 1947; R. H. Tawney, Religion and the Rise of Capitalism, New York, Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1926; Nicholas Berdyaev, The End of Our Time, New York, Sheed and Ward, 1937; Hilarie Belloc, The Crisis of Civilization, New York, Sheed and Ward, 1936; also Amintore Fanfani, Capitalism, Protestantism, Catholicism, London, Sheed and Ward (Unicorn Books). 14. For a very explicit use of this analogical method cf., Arnold Toynbee, Civilization on Trial, New York, Oxford University Press, 1948, Chapter 4. 115</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN CATHOLIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW use of three basic concepts, ideal types in Max Weber's sense of the term, is excellent.15 Sorokin wrote his Cultural Dynamics in terms of the Idealistic, Ideational, and Sensate culture types. According to his main thesis, Sensate culture (like the modern twentieth century culture) follows an Ideational one which was in turn the chronological heir to an Idealistic type. This same sequence, he finds in ancient Greece and Rome as well as more recent Euro- pean times. That these conceptualizations again are based on at least implicit an- ology is clear from this consideration: Sensate culture in Greece at a given period in her history is not identical (univocal) with Sensate culture in a given period of European history of the post-Christian era, but there is a likeness (evident from empirical data) between the behavior of the two cultures. Knowing our own modern sensate times experientially, enables us to "see" and understand this period in Greece, and reciprocally, gives insight into our own times. The same terminology fits, positis ponendis, and aptly characterizes both cultures, and relates to the mind new knowledge since it sees the similarity. Thus analogical conceptualization is the root of, and source of this sociological knowledge. Allusion must be made to similar conceptualization in the writings of Carle Zimmerman, particularly his Family and Civilization.16 The same gen- eral thesis proposed here is exemplified in his treatment of the family in his- tory under the concepts: crude trustee, domestic and atomistic family types. The fact is, that analogical historical position is the theoretic basis of a cyclic view of history and evolution.17 This paper is making no pretence to completeness in giving evidence of analogy in these various schools, and especially not in regard to the third and most recent, the structure-analytic group. Two representatives of this school alone will be used to show that analogical conceptualization is im- plicitly, if not always explicitly assumed as the basis of theory and research. In an essay entitled: "The Present Position and Prospects of Systematic Theory in Sociology," Talcot Parsons suggests and outlines a theory of so- ciological analysis involving such concepts as "role," "actor-situation" and a definition of social structure as a "system of patterned relationships of actors 15.

He continues Both because the "idiosyncratic" element in the behavior and motivitation of individuals is so great and because the levels of abstraction current in psychology have been what they have, in general, it has not been possible to derive an adequate theory of the mo- tivitation of socially structural mass phenomena through the simple "application" of psychological generalizations. The relationship between the psychological level and behavior in social systems is complex, but light is thrown on it in terms of the psy- chological implications of the conception of role.19 Again, Abram Kardiner states explicitly, the analogical conceptualiza- tions Freud made of psychoanalysis relative to sociology: Among the most valuable suggestions Freud made was that of an analogy between the practices of primitive people and neurotic symptoms. Some rather unproductive hy- potheses resulted from the pursuit of this analogy to too great lengths; nevertheless, the study of the origins of neurotic symptoms in the individual laid a basis for the un- derstanding of the minimal adaptive tools of man.20 In a slightly different context, the same author says: The integration of the two techniques, anthropological and psychological was later facilitated by the abandonment of the evolutionary hypothesis explained by the early anthropologists. For this was substituted the concept of cultures as functional wholes and the study of primitive societies as entities, a point of view of which Malinowski was the earliest exponent. All that was gained by the application of the concept of psychol- ogical culture pattern to primitive societies was the impression that institutions within a society were in large measure consistent with each other and that this consistency could be described in terms of analogies with entities found in psychopathology. This was a definite gain, but it was not a technique.21 Unfortunately, however, Kardiner does not realize, or at least does not explicitly advert to the fact that his own theory of "Basic Personality Struc- ture" is again another analogy, which indeed might yield certain insights, but is no more a technique than the one he criticizes in Malinowski. This point has been made by an English historian: These metaphorical applications of the processes of inanimate nature to the delineation of life, and particularly human life, are perhaps peculiarly dangerous nowadays just be- cause they are so much in fashion. Not so long ago, the danger was the other way. We used to think of the processes of inanimate nature anthropomorphically, and the progress of physical science was seriously hindered until this anthropomorphic, myth- ological habit of looking at nature was broken. We have, I think, broken it effectively. In our physical science, we are thoroughly on our guard nowadays against the so-called 18.

But perhaps, in extricating ourselves from the "pathetic fallacy" we have fallen unawares into an opposite "apathetic fallacy" - which is every bit as fallacious. We tend, because this feels and sounds "scientific," and because science nowa- days enjoys prestige, to think and talk about human beings as though they were sticks and stones and about life as though it were a stream of radiation or a constellation of protons and electrons. This may be a convenient simile, but it is, I am sure, a false route. 22 Some Possible Conclusions Thus far it would appear that sociology is and has been a discipline (rather than a science strictly so-called) which has been applying scientific concepts of one sort or another toward an understanding of human relations and behavior, and proceeding to justify the application of these concepts by massing empirical data. If this is true, then sociology has three most important elements: 1) analogical conceptualization; 2) empirical justification; 3) to the purpose of understanding human behavior or institutions. At the risk of the charge of "bias"- why are not theological and phil- osophical concepts as proper to this discipline analogically as any other? - is a question very much in place.23 Logically, their "right" to enter sociology is perfectly a pari to the others -- on the basis of analogical conceptuali- zation. Again, their empirical justification is possible and in some quarters al- ready partially realized.24 These are, in truth, the beginnings of "Catholic sociology," just as there is "factor-situation," "historico-philosophical," or "structure-analytic." The basis for the difference in this classification is the difference in basic type of conceptualization. Finally, there is, with relation to the third element given above, a kind of "divine guarantee," that human institutions are ultimately inexplicable without conceptualizations taken from objective supernatural revelations. For the purpose of simplification a thesis placed early in traditional systematic study of theology is given here in paraphrased form. It has what seems to be complete relevance here, especially to a social scientist who also has the 22. Arnold Toynbee, op. cit., p. 54. 23.

Due to the effects of original sin (blindness of the intellect and weakness of purpose), the human race (men) cannot by its own efforts, or without the help of God (revelation), know without error and with certainty the realities which effect the ordering of human institutions (behavior).2s From their very inception in human consciousness during the century of materialism, the nineteenth, the social sciences have insisted upon the need for empiricism and induction without ever ridding themselves of certain postulates derived deductively (by analogy) which they later worked out by empirical research. In this respect, the social sciences are themselves "cul- turally determined." Perhaps the time will come when they realize the possibility of knowledge concerning human behavior studied empirically and deductively as well, and that the mind of man sees clearest through the eyes of a divine nature who has given men the keys to understanding himself.
