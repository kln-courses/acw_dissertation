<plain_text><page sequence="1">observation: "The quaint old houses, three and four centuries old, some of them with their huge chimneys and quaint gables, give existence in their darker recesses to mon- strous shadows from the dazzling lights . . ." This could describe one of Feininger's own paintings. While both Hess and Scheyer repeatedly refer to the toys the master made partly for his three sons, and partly for his own enter- tainment, Lyonel Feininger: City at the Edge of the World-the arbitrary subtitle is taken from that of one of the drawings-is almost exclusively devoted to this very special side- line in his career. Feininger was, by the way, not the only modern artist to create toys- Klee, Picasso, Calder also made "excursions into the gamesome world," as T. Lux Feinin- ger writes. In 1911 a friend saw the toy en- gines and cars the painter had made for the amusement of his oldest son, Andreas (the photographer), and proposed that they be adapted for mass production in his father's factory for wooden toys. Unfortunately, World War I intervened and the plan never was carried out. Feininger continued to make toys for his sons. In a letter he half-seriously complained about his "periodical craze for making toys for Christmas," adding: "Every year I get the urge to saw wood into bits and paint them in bright colors. The boys take it for granted that I shall make 'mannequins' for them." As an old man, returned from Germany to his native New York, Feininger spent the winters whittling wood, to produce for his grandchil- dren figures of people and animals that are more fantastic, more grotesque than any he had created before: "The New York figu- rines, recalling some of the mysterious paint- ings of Piero di Cosimo, may be theriomor- phic humans of anthropomorphic animals." Many of the figures and houses are illus- trated, often in excellent color. The artist's son, Lux, is justified in his comment: "The toys an artist has fashioned may serve to gain an insight into the formal ideas of their creator."
