<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> The Long Life of a Dead King:   A Bronze Statue from Hazor in   Its Ancient Near Eastern Context Tallay Ornan The Institute of Archaeology  The Hebrew University of Jerusalem  Mount Scopus, Jerusalem 91905, Israel  tallay@mscc.huji.ac.il A Middle Bronze Age gold-coated bronze statue of a seated king found in a Late  Bronze Age context on the acropolis of Tel Hazor is interpreted as an old icon of a dead  king whose image was still meaningful centuries after its production. It is suggested that  the Middle Bronze Age royal statue was used by a Late Bronze Age king of Hazor to  reinforce his rule. The article discusses the role played by statues of dead kings in the  memory of the past and their use in royal self-legitimization in second-millennium Syria  and the Levant. The food provided to the dead in the Beyond, as recorded in ancient  Near Eastern myths, is compared with the food and drink offered to the dead by the liv- ing, as documented in texts and archaeological finds. Consequently, the possibility of  recognizing deified rulers in the archaeological record is examined, and a minimalist  view of the powers of dead kings is suggested.

In the  ancient Near East, where kingship was considered an  institution transmitted to humanity by the divine,1 and  thus sanctified, images of past kings were ideal means  by which later regimes could obtain legitimization.  The following, discussing an MB IIB statue recov- ered in a Late Bronze Age context of the 13th century,  seeks to present such a case. the statue The bronze statue in question depicts a seated  man wearing a rolled-hem garment and a tall oval  hat (fig. 1). It was uncovered at Tel Hazor in the sum- mer of 1996 (Ben-Tor 1996: 264; 2006a: 6–7, no. 12;  2008a: 1771, pl. VI, upper right; Ben-Tor and Rubiato  1999: 35; Schroer 2011: 388, fig. 964)2 in the west- ernmost of two small rooms north of the central hall  of the monumental structure crowning the acropolis  of Tel Hazor, whose construction is attributed to the  Late Bronze Age. The statue was found under the floor  in the southeastern corner of the room (Locus 7420),  in a shallow trench 40 cm wide running around the  entire length of the room’s southern and eastern walls  (Bonfil and Zarzecki-Peleg 2007: 35, 41). The statue,  30 cm high, is the largest statue of its type so far re- trieved in systematic excavation in the Levant (Ornan  2011a). Its uniquely large dimensions are consistent  with the size of the assemblage of metal statues and  figurines unearthed during the renewed excavations of  Area A at Hazor, numbering over 50 items, includ- ing fragments of 24 anthropomorphic figurines, 10  of which are almost complete. The wealth of this as- semblage indicates the importance of Hazor in terms  of metal statuary in the second millennium b.c. and  hints at a local production center at the site. Among  the prestigious items uncovered in Locus 7420 was  another large seated bronze statue (h. 35 cm), found  in the southwestern corner of the western room. The  tall hat adorned with an icon of two caprids flanking a  tree identifies the figure as a god, probably a new type  1 Cf. the Sumerian King List (ETCSL: t.2.1.1). 2 The statue, kept in The Israel Museum, was uncovered during  the renewed excavations of Tel Hazor by the Hebrew University, Fig. 1.

The same  </page> <page sequence="9"> 2012 THE LONG LIFE OF A DEAD KING 9 310–15, pl. 319:1, 2). Among local Middle Bronze IIB  scarabs, a man with a tall cylindrical hat but with a  dress lacking the rolled hem is shown on a seal from  Tel Esur Tomb 3 (Tell el-Asawir near Kibbutz Barkai)  in the Sharon Plain and on a seal from Tel Hadar lo- cated east of the Sea of Galilee (fig. 16; Beck 2002:  79–80, fig. 30a; Keel 2010: 600–601, no. 11).5 In all  other contemporary local scarabs that depict stand- ing or seated figures, the robes are also without rolled  hems, the figures have no head coverings, and their  hairdos vary. The fact that the figure with the same  oval hat does not appear on other scarabs may imply  that the images on these scarabs do not relate to the  royal image discussed here. They may represent rulers  of a different rank, or possibly functionaries (Tufnell  1956: 67–73; Schroer 1985: 77–81; Beck 2002: 88).  Assuming the various outfits on the scarabs were worn  by different members of the ruling class (rather than  reflecting regional or chronological variations), these  representations may point to a tiered structure of the  ruling elites, an indication of the complexity of urban  society in Canaan during the MB IIB. With some modifications—mainly, the much thin- ner rolled hem—this type of dress survived into the  Late Bronze Age. The use of the Middle Bronze Age  seal of Abban son of Šarran (an unknown king) by  Niqmepa on tablets from Alalakh Stratum IV (Col- lon 1975: 12, 149, 170–72, no. 11) exemplifies the  continuity of the Middle Bronze royal dress into the  Late Bronze Age. Indeed, this type of dress is found  on several later artifacts, such as the Late Bronze stat- ues from Temple H (fig. 10) and Area F at Hazor.

Nick Kardulias, and Derek B. Counts Since 1990, the Athienou Archaeological Project  (AAP) has investigated the Malloura valley on  the edge of the central Mesaoria plain near the  modern town of Athienou, Cyprus. Excavations  have concentrated on the Archaic-to-Roman  sanctuary and the adjacent settlement and cemeteries at the ancient site of  Malloura. Survey in the Malloura valley has revealed other sites ranging from  Aceramic Neolithic through Cypro-Classical, Roman and Late Medieval up  to hamlets abandoned only in the 20th century. This research has focused on  how successive rural populations in the Malloura valley have adapted to local  environmental changes and shifting political tides in the region, and how this  adaptation is reflected in the archaeological, historical, and ethnographic record  recovered by the project and reported in this volume.
