Some of these objects deserve special attention inasmuch as their makers portray pairs of animal heads or faces of the same or different species or an animal head paired with a human one (or abstract sym- bols of these) attached to a single body. Each of these parts may be represented naturalistically or stylized, sometimes so floridly as to pose difficulties in identifying the animal. The species represented are many, mostly fish and game. I submit that northern European specimens of this class, particularly from the Scandinavian Stone Age, provide sig- nificant leads in cross-cultural approaches to early religions. The exact age and center of origin of such images-or their typical homeland, if they arose in more than one culture practi- cally simultaneously-are, however, conjectural because the primitive beliefs associated with them seem to have been wide- spread in ancient Eurasia. Double-headed zoomorphic images survive importantly in shamanistic traditions of diverse ethnic groups in circumpolar and subcircumpolar Siberia, where, be- cause of prehistoric culture diffusion patterns, certain icono- 1 This work was supported by a grant from the University of Con- necticut Research Foundation.

BALAJI MUNDKUR, by formal training a biologist and Associate Professor in the Biological Sciences Group at the University of Connecticut (Box U-42, Storrs, Conn. 06268, U.S.A.), shifted his research and teaching activities entirely to the social sciences and humanities several years ago. His interests are interdisciplinary and cross-cultural, chiefly in animal cults, iconography, and the anthropological aspects of religious art. Among his nonbiological publications are The Cult of the Serpent: An Interdisciplinary Sur- vey of Its Manifestations and Origins (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1983), "The Alleged Diffusion of Hindu Divine Symbols to Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica: A Critique" (CA 19:541- 83), "Iayya in Islamic Thought" (The Muslim World 70:213-24), "The Roots of Ophidian Symbolism" (Ethos 6:125-59), "Western Karnataka Icons at Shirali" (Archives of Asian Art 31:104-9), "The Cult of the Serpent in the Americas" (CA 17:429-56), "Notes on Two Ancient Fertility Symbols" (East and West [Rome] 28:268- 80), and "The Enigma of Vainayaki" (Artibus Asiae 37:291-302). The present paper was submitted in final form 7 xi 83. graphic tendencies may have been established as early as in northern Europe. These tendencies seem to have been carried to northwestern North America during the trans-Beringian mi- grations of antiquity. The evidence from mythology and reli- gious art, which increases greatly and extensively southward in the Western Hemisphere, suggests that the representation of humans or certain chosen animal species as double-headed is a remarkably conservative trait of potential theoretical value for the comparative archaeology and ethnology of aboriginal northern Eurasia and the Americas. The recognition of continuity of cultural biases such as this is important because the societies involved may be ethnically re- lated or unrelated, geographically linked or separated, coeval or millennia apart. For example, the lakeside campsites at Tlapacoya, on the central Mexican plateau, date from shortly before 20,000 B.C. but include no objects relevant to my theme, while Early Preclassic (2000-1300 B.C.) terracottas ex- cavated nearby at Tlatilco include double-headed anthropo- morphic figurines that seem to be cultic (Pifia Chan 1958). Such gaps in our knowledge raise questions of a general nature which I shall address later. On the other hand, Gurvich (1979), focusing on data from the Soviet Union, enumerates several parallels in folklore, cus- toms, and utilitarian objects between contemporary aboriginal inhabitants of northern Asia and northern North America. An inevitable shortcoming of most Soviet studies, as he points out, is that they are limited to Siberian cultural elements even though these have analogues in North America. Since one- sided approaches also characterize most American writings, Gurvich's survey of the correspondences amply justifies his call for integrated, systematic analyses of data on both New and Old World indigenes. Particularly from a historical perspec- tive, the known similarities complement the direct genetic evidences of affinity-based on osteology and frequency distri- bution patterns of blood-group and serum-protein markers -between aboriginal Siberian, Eskimo, and Amerindian pop- ulations (Mourant, Kopec, and Domaniewska-Sobczak 1976; Szathmary and Ossenberg 1978; Stewart 1973: 22-55). Clearly, there is a need for underscoring the material and social traits that have resisted change among ethnic groups that had been exposed to acculturating forces long before the era of European exploration and trade. To list a few of the cultural similarities, with reference to maps 1 and 2: The Chukchi of northeasternmost Asia, like Vol. 25 * No. 4 * August-October 1984 451</page><page sequence="2">600 80O 800 600 0 NORTH POLE EKVEN I ~~~~t I ool 0 X &lt; * ?0 \? o A 6 V1\m A G 0 MAP 1. The North Eurasian landmass, showing relevant archaeological sites and the approximate distribution of cultural groups. A few others named in the text are omitted for the sake of visual clarity. In Siberia the ethnically and linguistically distinct Nentsy, Nganasany, Chukchi, Koryak, and Eskimo have very similar words for objects and natural phenomena found only, or chiefly, in the polar zone. In China the Ch'u, though commonly identified with a southern kingdom of a considerably later period, are placed in the northern "Classic" Shang and Chou region in accordance with modern views about a probable religio-social intercourse between the ancestors of the latter two and the Inner Mongolian proto- Ch'u. other Siberian tribes such as the Yukaghir, Nivkhi, Ulchi, Nanai, Koryak, and Negidal, share with the Aleuts, Alaskan Eskimo, and Athapaskans of North America the so-called strip-ornamentation of their clothing-the sewing on it of thin strips of leather wrapped with reindeer hair, sinew, or leather. The Tlingit, Algonkians, Aleuts, and Eskimo of North America share other typical features of dress with the Itelmen, Koryak, and Chukchi of the Soviet Arctic. Raven, and related, myths of the Tlingit and Itelmen (and other American and Siberian tribes) are so alike that they can only be interpreted as cultural heritages traceable to a common source. Traditions like these have been nurtured with little change on both sides of the far northern Pacific Basin millennia after the submer- gence, between 14,000 and 10,000 B.P. (West 1981), of the Beringian landmass that connected Asia and Alaska. It is gen- erally the secular traits that are well documented in North America and remarkably persistent as far away as the River Ob in western Siberia. Religious traits as a class seem even more likely to have been fostered conservatively, but-as Gur- vich recognizes, if implicitly, in his stimulating assessment of the available data-inquiry into their prehistory from an iconographic viewpoint has yet to be undertaken. I will utilize this criterion with reference to both prehistoric and relatively recent objects. Constrained, however, by limitations of space for illustrations, I shall avoid detailed chronological treatment and only indicate the potential of comparative iconography in view of the antiquity and extremely wide geographical distri- bution of bicephalous images. I must emphasize at the outset three significant points con- cerning chronology, art styles, and culture diffusion: First, the zoomorphic motifs of northern Eurasia are not at all compara- ble with those found in South Asian Hindu/Buddhist religious art, which incorporates symbols originating in the animal cults of early Dravidian and aboriginal tribal peoples, primarily of India. Almost as a rule, a Hindu deity is conceived as an- thropomorphic and given an animal symbol (usually vehicu- lar), but where a deity is multiheaded neither the human nor the animal is represented as double-headed. For example, icons of the Vedic anthropomorphic god Agni are occasionally double-headed, but never is his body fused with the head of his mount, the ram. Nor is the post-Christian elephant-headed anthropomorphic god Ganesa ever fused with his rat mount or endowed with two heads. Heramba-Ganesa, one of his iconic variants, has five elephant heads and is corporeally indepen- dent of his lion mount. The leonine-human form of the god Visnu is never seen with more than one lion's head. Innumer- able ndgas and ndginis-the semidivine hooded cobras of Hindu/Buddhist mythology-usually have one, three, five, seven, or more heads joined edgewise, at times as an aureole for a human head and torso grafted onto an ophidian body. They are hardly ever bicephalous or linked with another species (especially a cervid or a felid) in symbolic roles of the kind discussed below with respect to northern Eurasia and the Western Hemisphere (Gopinatha Rao 1914, Bhattasali 1929). Most importantly, the distinguishing features of Hindu mythology, iconography, and ritual practices (whether Vedic, 452 CURRENTCANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">8.r 8OX NORTH POLE L f0311s Crnt Well Col]3 UE~~~~~~~~~0E 400S' 0t X as 4 4 &gt;'0 ski OIONORAG IOO?

In Alaska south of Norton Sound the Bering Sea Eskimo speak Yupik-in common with east coast Siberian Eskimo-and are essentially different culturally and in physical type from Inupiak-speakers. The North Alaskan Eskimo are linguistically closer to Greenland Eskimo. Peru is shown in an inset. Puranic, or modern) and their Mahayana Buddhist Tibetan offshoots differ fundamentally from those of northern Eurasian shamanism.2 The historical development and phenomenology 2 Whether or not the term "shaman" is apt for religious leaders other than those of the "Siberian" (chiefly Tungusic) type for whom it was originally coined is a matter of opinion. It has often supplanted equiva- lent or near-equivalent indigenous terms far afield and, on the basis of alleged psychological similarities, even been applied to phenomenolog- ically rather distinct types. Little is known about the physiological genetics of the endorphins that are thought to influence a shaman's supposedly aberrant personality (Prince 1982). As an international term, "shaman" is used relatively infrequently by French ethnog- raphers and hardly ever by British structural-functionalists; in con- trast, many North American cultural anthropologists use it rather freely (see Hamayon 1983; Lewis 1981:25-26). Thus, in cross-cultural contexts, the neutral, flexible alternative "hierophant" seems more apt for any religious leader who-"ecstatically" but not necessarily through trance-decisively contributes to a society's ethnic identity (Mundkur 1983:250-53, 274). In this article, however, I employ "sha- of the latter are analyzed in innumerable scholarly works, most usefully, for general purposes, in anthologies such as those of Dioszegi (1968), Hoppal (1984), and Michael (1963). Hence, comparisons of northern Eurasian and Western Hemi- spheric art are not impaired by the hypotheses of the few scholars who have speculated about Hindu/Buddhist cul- tural inroads in pre-Columbian America during the late pre- and post-Christian eras. In short, the trans-Siberian and trans-Beringian human movements of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation (25,000-10,000 B.P.) and perhaps vigorous diffusion of the bicephalous style of art in one form or another within the Western Hemisphere antedate by many millennia any alleged South Asian influences.

However, these latecomers could hardly have affected cultures far to the south, where double-headed animal motifs occur in Peru from at least the 3d millennium B.C. Second, I differ from Badner (1963), Heine-Geldern (1966), Jett (1983), Shao (1976), and others who either underestimate or overlook the circumpolar and subcircumpolar art of Eurasia-especially that of quite early periods-but invoke superficial aspects of the appearance of Western Hemispheric motifs which, they suppose, are crucial and possibly influenced by Bronze Age Chinese and perhaps Dong Son or other South- east Asian art.3 The details invoked are subsumed under such terms as "kenning," "split and flayed" figures of fantastic beasts, "protruding tongue," "X-ray views, " "curled snouts, " "split representations," and many more. I do not in principle reject ornamental details as valueless. In the context of great temporal and geographical gaps, however, this criterion is fraught with uncertainties and invites subjective conclusions unless the religious background is adequately explored vis-a- vis the many problems of transoceanic culture transmission. In any case, animal motifs in Bronze Age northern Chinese art betray broad characteristics rooted in a more ancient East Siberian style or styles just as does Western Hemispheric, espe- cially Alaskan and Northwest Coast Indian, art. Hence I shall emphasize elementary forms and call attention to artistic detail only sparingly, except occasionally when comparing the works of cultures belonging to the same ethnic cluster or to closely related clusters listed by Murdock (1981). Furthermore, I hold that cross-cultural analogies (and especially homologies) based on zoomorphic art must be supported by information on partic- ular animal species, their impact on man's subsistence econo- mies or psychological sensitivities, and the mythologies and cults that hinge upon them. Third, while several species, particularly the cervids and bears native to northern Eurasian and northern North Ameri- can faunas, figure in the bicephalous art of these regions, ser- pent representations in this style are vanishingly few in the far north of both hemispheres. By contrast, the portrayal of this animal as double-headed or as one of a pair of species represented conjointly is noteworthy southward in Siberia and equally or more so in the religious traditions of innumer- able Amerindian tribes, particularly in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. This tendency, of course, is consistent with the far greater numbers of reptiles in the (at least seasonally) warmer latitudes. However, other animals such as the condor or other birds and felines also occur in combination with ophidian motifs in the art of the Andean cultures of Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. It is remarkable, therefore, that in both Old and New Worlds several societies inhabiting quite cold regions nurture in their mythologies and art memories of the serpent, a species they very rarely or practically never en- counter. Thus, in these regions the continuity of bicephaly involving this animal as an iconographic corollary cannot be fully appreciated without an awareness of the extraordinary peculiarities of man's biological and societal sensitivities to rep- tiles. I have adopted several viewpoints in a book (Mundkur 1983) surveying the worldwide, complex cultural repercus- sions. Drawing on Gurvich's (1979:34) support of my earlier views on the migration of cult symbols across Siberia and Be- ringia, I will now amplify certain little-explored aspects con- cerning species that are venerated conjointly. In far nothern Europe, bicephalous animal motifs seem to be traceable at least as far back as the early 7th millennium B.C., the Stone Age interval in these latitudes when the ice cap was 3 Speculations based on calendrical symbols or the distribution of domesticated species deserve separate questioning (see Mundkur 1978). in recession. They occur in petroglyphs and mobiliary objects across the coastal and inland, often lakeside, areas of northern Norway and Sweden, Finnmark, Karelia, and northwestern Russia. That they are represented in Siberia both in antiquity and among modern tribes is consistent with the fact that the circumpolar Eurasian region has witnessed extensive migra- tions of human stocks and cultural interactions since earliest times (Gjessing 1975; Okladnikov 1964a, b; Simonsen 1973). From the viewpoint of culture diffusion, the bicephalous motifs occurring in the Soviet Chukchi Peninsula and, on the opposite side of the Bering Sea, in Alaska are of special inter- est, while those found in the art of pre-Columbian Indians from the Pacific Northwest Coast and interior Canada south- ward to Mesoamerica and South America, it seems reasonable to suspect, are analogous and often closely homologous. Thus, though it is the more northerly works of art that concern us most, I will exemplify their diversity, in our particular con- texts, only in order to make the point that double-headed sym- bols are corollaries of an apparent tendency to pair species selectively and hence deserve a place in comparative ethnoar- chaeology. EURASIAN RELICS Prehistoric culture diffusion is generally regarded as having occurred almost wholly unidirectionally, from Asia to Alaska, but its exact currents in circumpolar Eurasia itself are uncer- tain. Stylistically, therefore, the earliest bicephalous forms pre- sumably are rooted in an archetype whose center of origin- Siberian versus North European-is unknown. Such forms recur in different periods, but, regardless of age, all are charac- terizable essentially as members of the "animal style," "Sibe- rian animal style," or "Scythian style"-a diverse assemblage of regional works of art that combine a vigorous naturalism with the stylization of zoomorphic subjects. These terms are conventionally applied-though with questionable rigidity- to specimens from the Bronze Age, which form a majority (Artamonov 1969, Villa Hugel 1967, Bunker, Chatwin, and Farkas 1970). The work of several ethnically unrelated nomadic or plundering societies chiefly of the mid-lst millen- nium B.C., the bronzes occur typically from Mongolia and northern China to northwestern Europe, with occasional ex- tensions into Ireland and Britain. Their common "animal- style" traits stem from a uniformity in the Eurasian nomad's traditional way of life and relationship to the fauna of steppe, boreal forest, and tundra and are typically expressed through ornamental, utilitarian objects such as belt buckles, weapons, mirror frames, etc. The antecedents of this style apparently belonged to extremely early groups of hunter-gatherers whose art merely reflected magicoreligious beliefs about innumerable animal species of the vast Eurasian expanses. Bicephalous forms constitute only a minority of the "animal- style" repertoire, but, as I have argued elsewhere (Mundkur 1983:35-39, 98, 128, 157), it is noteworthy that certain species among those represented-chiefly the reindeer and elk, the bear, the sable, the seal and walrus, waterfowl, and fish- have always figured in the subsistence economies of northern Eurasian indigenes and from the earliest times seem to have commanded attention more than others as "guardian spirits," symbolized in charms, amulets, or votive objects betokening the hunter's concerns and cult practices. The latter, for the most part, revolved around the seances of shamans and their spiritual transformations into the varied animals invoked as "assistants" indispensable for their "supernatural" perfor- mances. Tallgren (1936:188), for instance, describes a small image from Obdorsk (Salekhard), northwestern Siberia, in the form of a masked man wearing headgear portraying a double- headed animal, seemingly a bear. In secular superstitions, too, 454 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">Mundkur: THE BICEPHALOUS "ANIMAL STYLE" bears and cervids were regarded as a tribesman's kin and cus- tomarily hunted and killed in rituals designed to ensure the quarry's future abundance. In these contexts, icons of the ser- pent stand apart, for though this animal is often a totem that "helps" the shaman in healing the sick, it is far more an object of revulsion and fear than one of economic significance. Yet, it too is a cult object and, practically everywhere in the regions within our purview, has left traces of its past importance through double-headed images akin to those of species sought as food. I shall use the latter kind as a basis for comparisons. *A simple example of bicephalous art is a bone carving (fig. 1) shaped like a double-headed fish, the talismanic character of which is clearly suggested by a central slot, presumably for a thong for suspending the piece from one's person. About 17 cm long, this object is from a burial of the Pianaborskaia culture, an ancient (probably Early Iron Age), primarily northern or northwestern ethnic group of the Beloi River basin in the Ilishchevskaia region of Siberia (Vasiutkin and Gorbunov 1973:168-69). Fig. 2 shows a Russian "axe" with haft-hole, modelled upon conjoint hare and elk heads (Grakov 1971:94). It was probably ceremonial, to judge from the known importance of hafted axes in the primitive cults of Stone Age northern European peoples, especially in Scandinavia. The high esteem for the elk in Stone Age Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the U.S.S.R. is also apparent in single-headed elk-shaped implements and in innumerable rupestral engravings depicting its herds. Bicephalous depictions of full-bodied elk-some with cloven- hoofed pairs of legs pointing in opposite directions-are infre- quent, but, as Hallstr6m (1960:159-208, 210, 252, 292, 310, 318) observes with reference to Namforsen, central Sweden, these variants are "among the most interesting figures in all this carving material." Suggesting that they may have "an in- herent signification of their own of a mystic, mythological kind," he points out (p. 310) that "they constitute an entirely unique phenomenon in the Nordic petroglyphic art." At Vyg, Russia, about 225 km south of the Arctic Circle, the petro- glyphs include figures of double-headed reindeer. These, he suspects (pp. 351-52), are but modified repetitions of the elk motifs at Namforsen, between which site and Vyg "a consider- able spiritual contact seems to have existed in spite of the enormous distance." Norwegian Stone Age petroglyphs abound in reindeer, and these are sometimes closely jux- taposed with whale or another cetacean or bear or paired, but if double-headed examples exist, they remain undescribed ex- cept for a notable case: at Fykanvatnet, about 36 km north of the Arctic Circle, there is a large full-length profile (2.1 x 1.4 m) of a bear atop whose hindquarters are depicted the head and sweeping antlers of a reindeer (Gjessing 1932: pl. 6, 11, 12). From a cultic viewpoint, the most relevant of the animal subjects engraved in rock are those which portray man and double-headed elk separately but juxtaposed and those which combine man and animal intimately as if to suggest their corporeal fusion or the spiritual transformation of each into the other (figs. 3-5). This theme, discussed by Hallstrom (1960:150-51), recurs in small objects such as the bone "comb" in figure 6. Probably a meat or fish scraper, from Gullrum, Sweden (Lithberg 1914: fig. 164), it seems to have been a utilitarian if not ceremonial object that reflects the spirit world of the shaman or the hunter as eloquently as the rock engrav- ings. The cultic importance of cervids in Stone Age northern Europe, however, is noteworthy for another reason pertinent to the rest of our discussion. Hallstrbm (1960:6-8) documents a petroglyph that portrays man simultaneously in juxtaposition with serpent and elk. Part of a group of animals which, except for an indistinct individual ("bear"?), "stand out exceedingly sharp and clear, in a mellow, bright red colour," painted on a rock face at Haistskotjairn, Sweden, only about 350 km south of the Arctic Circle, the human figure is endowed with an ornate head, possibly an antler headdress, very close to which is a vertical zigzag line with a single knobbed end that "can hardly be explained as anything else [but a serpent]. " Since the latter's prestige is only enhanced by these associations, one should note that in addition to rock engravings, naturalistic or stylized representations of serpents also occur as grave goods carved from bone or, more often, antler and as engravings on serpent- shaped antler axe handles and spearheads and knife blades of slate and bone. Objects such as these are widespread in Scan- dinavia and the Baltic region, in the Gorbunovo peat bogs, on the island of Olenii in Lake Onega, and in the White Sea region of Russia, as well as at other sites of the northwestern Euro- pean Stone Age and later periods (Ravdonikas 1936; Gurina 1956, 1961; Moora 1957). At least four sculptured Russian Bronze Age daggers are known in which the figure of a serpent is combined with the figure or head of an elk. Perhaps the most direct attestations of ophidian traditions are the Stone Age petroglyphs themselves. At Vyg a man is depicted flanked by a large, undecipherable symbol and an equally large serpent. At Vitlycke, Bohuslan, southwestern Sweden, an engraving depicts a man with upraised hands in a posture suggesting homage to the relatively immense, sinuous serpentine figure positioned in front of him. Hallstrom (1960:1-15, 18, 75, 118, 219-378) discusses at length these and other petroglyphs which, in central Sweden, involve chiefly the elk. In Norway the petroglyphs include a few isolated, some- times indistinct serpent motifs. However, in one notable ex- ample from Vingen, near the central coast, the sinuous form of a serpent is depicted very closely parallel to the spine of a reindeer (Hallstr6m 1938:418). A slate knife found in this gen- eral region has a handle that ends in the form of a bear's head and a blade that is etched with double zigzags to denote a serpent and its forked tongue (Mundkur 1983: fig. 76b). Clearly, in a climate that favored cervids and bears far more, the serpent's impact on human societies was not incon- siderable. There are, to my knowledge, no double-headed ser- pents in northern European petroglyphs, but this motif is not unknown in other artistic media. Several bone combs of the kind seen in figure 7, for example, come from ancient Estonia, U.S.S.R. In this specimen, paired holes are drilled between the lower sinuosities and also into each of the heads, which are ducklike(?), and there is a larger hole for suspension in the center of the element above the folds of the body. This hole and the size and appearance of this comb plainly suggest its talis- manic character, and identification of its motif as ophidian is strengthened by Shmidehelm's (1959:167) and Moora's (1957:226-31) references to prehistoric serpent cults in the Baltic and neighboring regions. It is of interest that a rather similar, clearly double-headed serpent (fig. 8) occurs on a silvered bronze pendant from a tomb of the Warring States period (481-221 B.C.) of Inner Mongolia. It even incorporates a nondescript animal corre- sponding to the element above the sinuous creature carved on the Estonian bone comb just described. In another Mongolian bronze of identical background, a twisting bicephalous serpent is located between and continuous with paired camel heads (fig. 9). Bicephalous serpent-like figures in a variety of orna- mental, fantastic forms are widespread across the northern parts of the Old World. A "wolf"- and "griffin"-headed bronze object of the Tagar II period, 5th-4th centuries B.C., from central Siberia (fig. 10) is conceptually not too distant from a sculptured jade pendant of the 7th-6th centuries B.C. from China (fig. 11). This latter object, the work of the Ch'u, a shamanistic Mongoloid people then dominant in North China, represents the t'ao-t'ieh, a creature of dim origins that in art seems generally to be regarded as "a holistic unit ... a design complex consisting of horned mask over split-animal body, Vol. 25 * No. 4 * August-October 1984 455</page><page sequence="6">2~~~~~ 3 4 7~~~~~~ 112 FIGS. 1-12.

The relics from the Sutton Hoo ship burial in England (ca. A.D. 625) include a gilt-bronze shield-boss in the form of a dragon decorated with garnet eyes inlaid upon the large head, inter- laced sinuosities on the body, and involute, feather-like motifs on its edges (fig. 12). Its second head might hardly be noticed unless one scrutinized the "tail" end for eyes (also set with garnets) and an unflared, smaller mouth or unless one were aware that the Sutton Hoo relics betray Teutonic affinities and include belt buckles, clasps, etc., that are decorated with obvi- ously bicephalic animal forms besides complex arrangements of paired, intertwined serpents (Speake 1980:31-33 and pl. 4a, e, 6, 7, 8, 9h). It is clear from these examples that stylization and florid ornamentation can sometimes conceal the identity of an archetypal species and impede recognition of its fantastic derivatives. The reasons for comparing bicephalous representations, therefore, extend beyond iconography into its foundations in the religious backgrounds and prehistoric migrations of varied Siberian ethnic groups, many of which possess clear-cut ophid- ian traditions. For instance, Lipskii (1970: figs. 1, 4) illustrates engraved motifs on monoliths of a Late Palaeolithic sun cult found in the Upper Yenisei River basin, near Minusinsk, one of which portrays a man, probably a shaman, on whose forehead is a distinct bifurcate mark and near whom are shown four sinuous, upright serpents. In another monolith, a human face is divided by a horizontal line that bifurcates at both ends. The face is connected to an upright "body" consisting merely of a thin line split at the ends, presumably to indicate a double- headed serpent. These ancient relics are of interest because contemporary Yakut believe that the body of their "first sha- man" consisted of a mass of serpents (Mikhailowski 1894:64). Yakut pictorial symbolism, however, is sometimes hazy, for their shamans' robes may bear insignia in the form of split- ended ribbons and ongons (charms) that are not always as explicitly ophidian as the bicephalous Nanai representation in figure 13. The Entsy and Nentsy (and sometimes Sel'kup) sha- man's paraphernalia includes objects whose symbolism would be mysterious if one were unaware of tribal traditions. Key objects such as the drumstick and the simple bifurcate wand in figure 14, for example, are carried together in the same leather pouch. Known as sedu or tuyatoma, the wand embodies pro- tector spirits to ensure that someone is always present "to keep the tent fires alive," an apotropaic metaphor against death or disease striking all in the tribe. The wand resembles a serpent's bifid tongue but more likely represents a double-headed ser- pent itself: its tips stand for the mythical pair of personages the Nentsy call tu nisya and tu nebya, "father and mother of fire," and the latter's epithet selchi shut emysyt, "mistress of ser- pents," clearly attests to the ophidian associations of this cult object (Anisimov 1963:189; Prokofyeva 1963:151-52). The Nganasany shaman's wand in figure 15 -used in the madusya, the important religious ceremony of the "clean tent"-is rather more elaborate, for it is but a miniature model of the shaman's tunic and has double nonhuman heads. In appearance these are only vaguely ophidian, but their significance is clearly chthonic, since they represent the animal spirits of the "lower world." These examples of symbolic analogies-indeed, homologies-are significant not only because the Nganasany speak a Samoyedic language and possess words and beliefs found among the non-Samoyed Tungus and Yakut, but also because, like the Samoyedic Entsy and Nentsy, they are among the most northerly peoples of the Soviet Union and live well within the Arctic Circle (Popov 1964:571, 579). That Palaeoasiatic circumpolar peoples disseminated animal- oriented traditions such as these to the Western Hemisphere in remote antiquity is a probability that cannot be minimized, for the variations in artistic expressions here are quite spectacular. THE BERING STRAIT AREA The most intriguing facets of bicephaly as an art style involve the Bering Sea Basin, where it persists both on the Soviet side among Palaeoasiatic groups such as the Chukchi and on the Alaskan side among several Eskimo groups. The importance of this circumstance is enhanced, first, by archaeological finds dated 2258 ? 250 years B.C. and ca. A.D. 250, respectively, from sites of the Okvik-Old Bering Sea culture and that of Ipiutak (whose inhabitants were not part of the cultural con- tinuum leading from Okvik-Old Bering Sea to modern Es- kimo) and, second, by the persistence of bicephalous motifs among relatively modern Bering Sea and Inuit Eskimo. In all instances, however, the motifs reflect the same attitudes that prevailed in the European and Siberian hunter's or shaman's spirit world of animals and are described in detail with refer- ence to the Chukchi, the Bering Sea Eskimo, and the Igalik and Netsilik Eskimos by Bogoras (1909:345-65), Fitzhugh and Kaplan (1982:162-216), and Rasmussen (1929:130-52; 1931:292-314, 498-501), respectively. The artistic expressions of these attitudes vary widely-from purely utilitarian objects such as seal drags, handles, and harpoon foreshafts and rests to amulets and symbols on clothing, in tattoo, and on shamans' effects such as masks and wands. Almost every species of animal in the Arctic fauna is represented in the objects exemplified in figures 16-30, only a few of which need be explained. Arutyunov, Levin, and Sergeyev (1964:339) describe an amulet of walrus ivory (fig. 19) as one "on which the ancient talented carver succeeded in reproducing almost the entire us- able fauna: the sculptured head of a walrus, mountain sheep, seal, polar bear, and some sort of cetacean are combined in such a way that a particular detail, when looked at from one side, represents the horns of a sheep, and, when turned around, the tusks of a walrus, and so on." The special significance of this is that it is an amulet-note the suspension holes-from the early Eskimo cemetery (Okvik affinities) at Ekven, Chukchi Peninsula, and that the animal heads sculp- tured on each of its four aspects are paired. Even harpoon foreshafts (fig. 20) at Ekven and other coeval sites have carv- ings showing paired, stylized animal heads with gaping mouths pointing in opposite directions. Frequently, there is a third stylized head carved in between, much as in the modern, naturalistically carved Chukchi object in figure 21. Naturalistic effigies of the serpent, of course, are hard to come by, but evidences of the continuity of ophidian traditions in art and myth, as elsewhere in the far north, are not missing among the Eskimo. The simple Y-shaped symbol on an Inuit Eskimo comb of the prehistoric period (fig. 25) and, from the contact period, on an Igalik Eskimo woman's tattooed hand (fig. 26) is noteworthy because it also occurs on Inuit shamans' leather masks as labrets of thin leather cut and sewn in the form of bifurcated slivers. An old specimen of such a mask is in storage at the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto (Acc. No. HC 2311). It is tempting to regard this Y-shaped symbol as ophid- ian, for it is used worldwide to connote a serpent's bifid tongue. However, though Rasmussen (1929:148; 1931:292-314) stresses that Igalik and Netsilik Eskimo employ tattoo specifically to protect them from a nondescript, mythical mon- ster of the netherworld called Nuliajuk, there is no evidence that these Y forms represent the ophidian tongue. The Siberian objects in figures 13-15, the Chukchi representation of a man and his guardian spirit in figure 18, and, more importantly, prehistoric cultural contacts between different ethnic groups suggest that these Y-shaped motifs are vestiges of an ancient Old World symbolism whose original meaning the New World Eskimo do not remember.

In contrast, the shaman's mask in figure 27 is a less elusive, and fortunately quite crucial, iconographic link from the Nor- ton Sound region of Alaska. The fantastic double-headed crea- ture painted on it represents one of the most fearsome mythic animals imagined by contemporary Bering Sea Eskimo, the palraiyuk. It is conceived as a serpent, as the tapered body of the single-headed individual in figure 28 suggests. The tongue is bifid in neither of these representations-an understandable shortcoming, since serpents are rarely encountered in the vicin- ity of Norton Sound, whereas a hardy viper, Vipera berus, seasonally crosses the Arctic Circle in Sweden and reaches within a degree or two of this zone in parts of Siberia (Darling- ton 1957:178-80). The palraiyuk's ophidian ancestry, how- ever, is more credible than Nelson's (1899:444-45, pl. 95) sur- mise of a crocodilian one, since the crocodile, unlike the serpent, is exotic, tropical, and unknown in Siberian and northern North American mythic art. That it is Chinese or South Asian in origin is, in my opinion, equally unlikely. Ana- lyzing the complex mythic and artistic lineage of the t'ao- t'ieh-perhaps the only Oriental fantastic creature comparable to the palraiyuk-Paper (1978:26) writes that "speculation [about the t'ao-t'ieh as the draconic descendant of] the crocodile . . . is readily disproved." Eskimo regard the pal- raiyuk as extinct, its last representative having been killed by the Magemut tribe a long time ago when the climate was warm and the summers long. These rapacious monsters were re- putedly denizens of lakes and marshes, where they lay in wait to pounce upon hunters venturing thither on foot or in canoes and umiaks. To counter this danger, Eskimo often painted a palraiyuk on these vessels. Indeed, the palraiyuk is an impor- tant element in creation myths about the culture hero Raven, who, while travelling in the sky with the first created man, warns him of the dangers posed by the monster. That the palraiyuk is modelled upon the serpent and sur- vives as such in the traditions of all major Eskimo groups is suggested by the horrendous qualities also attributed to legend- ary, gigantic caterpillar- and wormlike monsters called tisik- puk by Bering Sea Eskimo and by other names as far away as Greenland, where they occur in art (Knuth 1960:20, pl. 1). In the Eskaleutian dialect of the (Arctic) Inuktitut Eskimo and among the Northwest Alaskan Naupaktomiut Eskimo, respec- tively, the words kopilrok and tirichik connote "serpent" as well as "worm" (Thibert 1970:52, 64; Hall 1975:415), just as the Old Norse (Old Icelandic) and Old English words ormr and wyrm, respectively, do not intrinsically discriminate between these two species (Buck 1949:193-95). Thus, comparative iconography and oral traditions rooted in superstition leave little room for doubt that the serpent, rather than the worm, is the more likely inciter of the fear-laden myths of far northern peoples, just as worm and crocodilian myths are over- shadowed by ophidian ones even in the tropics. The antiquity of the palraiyuk may be gauged from a fos- silized bone believed to be an image of it that is ornamented in the Okvik style and dated to well over 2,000 years ago (fig. 29). It is the oldest known Eskimo artifact from the Yukon- Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, and because equally old palraiyuk- like objects in the Okvik style also occur on St. Lawrence Island (in the Bering Sea, rather closer to the Soviet coast than to the Alaskan), it corroborates its discoverer Nelson's (1899:445) view that palraiyuk myths are an authentic Eskimo conception that owe nothing to traders and explorers. These foreigners, we should note, had totally bypassed the Bering Sea Eskimo (the most populous group) until Nelson's arrival in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and Norton Sound in 1877. The stylistic affinities and chronological relations of this fossilized bone image are discussed by Collins (1959), who concludes that the linear geometric markings on it and other early Eskimo artifacts "are actually closer to those of the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic than to any later styles in America or Eurasia." Archaeological parallels such as these merit attention for another reason. The double-headed palraiyuk on the wooden mask in figure 27-certainly datable to earlier than 1877-is presaged in one of Larsen and Rainey's (1948:137-38, pl. 55) signally important discoveries at ancient Ipiutak, an island near Point Hope, on the Alaskan Arctic coast of the Chukchi Sea. One of the finds from a grave of unknown date (fig. 30) seems to have been intimately connected, like much other Ipiutak art, with shamanistic burial practices. Consisting of seven sections of walrus ivory held together by cleats, this object-actually an "open" mask, as its form and nose and mouth section reveal-bears on its upper section a small schematized face positioned above two arched "eyebrows" and "eyes." Each of the two lateral sections bears a sinuous form that terminates, at the lower end, in a schematized head. Thus, if one imagines the face of its wearer in the opening, the engravings on the upper and lateral sections together portray a double-headed ophidian form reminiscent of the palraiyuk painted on the wooden mask in figure 27. Like the Eskimo objects from ancient burials at Ekven and Uelen on the Chuk- chi Peninsula as well as more recent objects from that penin- sula, innumerable examples from Ipiutak portray a face or facelike motif in the center of an ornately decorated symmetri- cal object, many of which are so stylized that one cannot recog- nize the animal species they represent. All this suggests that the convention was but an iconographic variant in the reper- toire of an established, regional "animal style" prevalent for several millennia on both sides of the Bering and Chukchi Seas (Larsen 1979-80: fig. 6; Larsen and Rainey 1948: fig. 38; Ray 1961; figs. 29, 30). In contexts of cultural conservatism, this "Beringian connec- tion" is underscored by the facts that the art of Ipiutak has features found both in relics of the Old Bering Sea culture and in Scytho-Siberian art and that animal-style carvings were at- tached to clothing around the shoulders of corpses, as was frequent among the shamans of Siberia and Mongolia. Fur- thermore, in Ipiutak art there are "strange creatures which resemble reptiles and amphibians" exhibiting artistic elements that recur in modern Eskimo and Northwest Coast American Indian carvings (Larsen and Rainey 1948:146, 149-52; Bandi 1969:113). It will be increasingly clear that the persistence of bicephaly in religious art southward, particularly the emphasis on the double-headed serpent and occasionally the convention of placing a face or head in its middle, owes as much to primor- dial human attitudes towards animals as to prehistoric cultural interactions. AMERINDIAN RELICS It is hardly a coincidence that the tribal groups which most starkly illustrate iconographic continuity of the kind discussed so far are immediate neighbors of the Eskimo: the Northwest Coast Indians of Alaska and Canada, who in their shamanistic traditions embody the normal human revulsion of the serpent in a dreaded mythic creature widely known as sisiutl. The crucial position of sisiutl in comparative ethnographic aspects of bicephalous art cannot be overemphasized. In contrast to the hazy ophidian traditions of the Eskimo, the Northwest Coast Indians have a rich, clear-cut body of sacred beliefs revolving around this fantastic creature. Unambiguously identified as a double-headed serpent with a face in the middle, it constitutes the most tangible reference point for comparisons involving the warmer parts of the Americas in which this motif persists, often cryptically, to this day. Rather than repeat the sisiuti myths I have summarized elsewhere (Mundkur 1983:55-56, 165-68, 250, 275), I shall proceed to a point more useful for our purposes. 460 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">Mundkur: THE BICEPHALOUS "ANIMAL STYLE" Portrayals of sisiutl on shamans' wands, masks, amulets, "soul catchers," house beams, etc., are legion in museum col- lections. The overwhelming majority (as in the Kwakiutl wand in figure 31) have prominently protruding but not bifid tongues. Some sisiutl effigies, such as the Haida shaman's "soul catcher" in figure 32, are even tongueless. Nonetheless, in Haida art itself, the ophidian identity of the archetypal animal is occasionally explicit in objects that do reveal the bifid-tongued serpent, as in a simple wooden charm in which this animal is addorsed to a finbacked whale (fig. 33). There are also works of art which fit, albeit subtly, the definition of sisiutl as a double-headed serpent with a human face in the middle (fig. 34). In a polychrome wooden mask of the north- ernmost branch of the Haida from Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, only about 1,000 km south of the Arctic Circle, the sisiutl-rather than what may seem to be a man swallowing two whales, as some have supposed-is signified merely by two stuffed cloth bifid tongues stuck into the corners of the mouth. These examples show how elusive, if not inscrutable, conventionalized animal symbols can be, especially those de- rived from memory rather than observation. This is evident from a Haida shaman's staff on which a serpent is carved quite naturalistically except for the dorsal placement of its ventral scales (for details, see Mundkur 1983: 297 n. 228 and fig. 32c). That the similarities between bicephalous sisiutl and pal- raiyuk, including their marked aquatic associations and evil qualities, are not fortuitous but part of the body of traditions shared by Eskimo and Northwest Coast Indians is apparent from key elements and episodes in their mythologies, notably those involving the Raven creation myth, Thunderbird, and Whale. Indeed, as Locher (1932), Riistow (1968), and Badner (1974) have shown, sisiutl and Thunderbird are assigned inter- changeable roles in the dualistic cosmology of the Northwest Coast Indian tribes-as supernatural symbols of the Lower and Upper Worlds. A Nootka drum illustrates this vividly in a scene portraying Thunderbird (as the alter ego of sisiutl, in this context single-headed) lifting Whale from the sea (fig. 35). Ber- ing Sea Eskimo, too, portray this mythic feat in an engraved motif on a double-(bear-)headed harpoon rest (fig. 22). Parallels such as these are inseparable from the growing realization among archaeologists that ancestral Eskimo and American Indian populations were far more closely knit than has hitherto been suspected. The evidence points, according to Dumond (1979:16), to a probable derivation of southern Northwest Coast Indians "from the same great if possibly heterogeneous Paleoarctic population that gave ultimate rise to Eskimo and Aleuts" and also to a history of "long-term and systematic concourse between ancestral Pacific Eskimos and ancestral Indians of that coast, in a manner similar to, but much more ancient than, that which has been inferred to have been possible in the Alaskan interior." He reports that the oldest microblade assemblages of the general Paleoarctic Sibe- rian-American type, radiocarbon-dated to as early as 7000 B.C., occur on the central British Columbia coast. On Queen Charlotte Island, a Haida center, they date to about 5000 B.C. In the Strait of Georgia, home of the Kwakiutl and Nootka, they date to at least 3000 B.C. Against this background, the fossilized bone in figure 29-the oldest known relic from the Bering Sea Eskimo homeland-acquires greater meaning. Since the etched patterns on it are believed to hint strongly at an Okvik-Paleo-Eskimo ancestry stretching back at least two millennia, the Alaskan delta region where it was found ap- pears to have been occupied by a people whose religious tradi- tions were derived in much earlier times-seemingly with little change-from the customs of their Asian cousins. Lantis (1947) describes the recent forms of ceremonialism in Alaska. Thus, there are strong incentives for extending comparative iconography even beyond the frontiers of the Eskimo and Northwest Coast Indian homelands if one takes into account the ethnicity of the earliest waves of migrants to the Western Hemisphere (MacNeish 1979, Laughlin 1977), their probable religious biases, the idea that the biological difference between Eskimo and Indians as a whole may be less sharp than was once believed (Szathmary and Ossenberg 1978), and the grow- ing realization that, in prehistory, interaction between the two groups seems not to have been impeded by any major ethnic barriers at potential points of contact in the Alaskan interior, on the Canadian borders, and along the Pacific Coast and in the hinterland (Smith 1979, Dumond 1979). All these factors place us on a fairly firm footing if we recognize that sensitivity towards reptiles is well a,ttested in human social history and pursue the artistic expressions of ophiolatry among Indian cul- tures dwelling in warmer climates. Water snakes and rattlesnakes have a prominent role in the spirit world of the Ojibwa, who dwell around the Great Lakes regions of southern Canada. They believe in a supernatural power, manido, comparable to the Eskimo inua, that reveals itself, especially when summoned by a shaman, through di- verse animal species. A manido may be beneficent, but highest in the scale of supernatural "bad spirits" is Nzagima, a vicious, greatly feared power personified by the water serpent. This manido is linked to Thunderbird, thunder, lightning, the sha- man's drum, witchcraft, solar and lunar myths, and the car- dinal points (Hoffman 1891:189-221). Jenness (1935:29-40, 68) found these Ojibwa beliefs also among the Cree and other Indians around Hudson's Bay. According to Amoss (1978:65), one of the strongest surviving ancient rituals among the mod- ern Nooksack, an inland Salish group in southwestern Canada, is the summoning of the serpent by their shaman. This species is his principal source of power, chosen from among his many animal "guardian spirits," which correspond closely to those imagined by the Chukchi as described by Bogoras (1909). I shall not elaborate on Ojibwa, Cree, and Salish art but will move on to a few other Indian groups farther south in the Americas. In the United States, the Algonquians, Sioux, Kiowa, Co- manche, Cheyenne, Arapaho, and prairie tribes in general weave Thunderbird myths intimately into the themes of light- ning and rain (Mooney 1896:968-7 1). An ophidian-avian dual- ism is betrayed by the ornamentation of a rawhide Thunder- bird effigy worn during ritual dances (fig. 36). The motif painted on it to suggest this dualism consists of a circular spot, the bird's heart or soul, from which emanates, upwards, a pair of single-ended zigzags that correspond to the wings they are painted upon and so symbolize flashes from the sky and the rainstorm. From the lower half of the circular spot descends another pair of zigzag lines. The tip of each, however, is bifur- cated, and, with the "heart" in between, these zigzags clearly emblematize a double-headed serpent's sinuous body, bifid tongue, and, jointly with Thunderbird, celestial-chthonic- electric powers. Figures 37 and 38 are Zunli masks from New Mexico. The double-headed serpent is unambiguous in one of them, while in the other a seemingly discrete "pair" of zigzag structures flanking the face is oriented upwards. That both masks have a pluvial symbolism is clear from their use in rain- making ceremonies. Furthermore, by portraying a "double- headed serpent with a face in the middle," the Zunli artist repeats a theme already witnessed in Eskimo and Northwest Coast Indian art. Tzi-daltai amulets, treasured as sacred charms of inestima- ble value by the diyi ("medicine man" or shaman) of the Apache of southern New Mexico, are discussed at length by Bourke (1892:588-93). They were made specifically from light- ning-riven wood, and, though used to achieve varied goals, their leitmotif consisted of symbols for rain, clouds, raindrops, the four cardinal directions, and, typically, the lightning- serpent. Often crudely engraved in the wood, these patterns are not always easily discernible.

Similar emblems occur on Apache "medicine shirts," phylacteries, and "medicine sashes." One of the latter (fig. 40) leaves little to the imagination. It consists of two styl- ized rattlesnakes, each indicated merely by a zigzag for the body and chevrons for rattles. They point in opposite direc- tions, their tail ends touching a central medallion divided into segments by tiny human figures, with markings connoting yel- low and red serpents, and representing the four cardinal direc- tions.

Mesoamerican civilized society, whose influence on other cul- tures of the region is usually regarded as "seminal," one finds quite simple bi- and tricephalic motifs, generally serpent- "dragon" or human heads, less frequently feline heads, but hardly ever those of any other identifiable species (Quirarte 1981:289-308). The exact numinous significance of these motifs to the Olmecs is unknown, but their symbolism may have differed little from that of the better-understood successor cultures.

The head seen in profile on the left, however, has a row of four teeth and is clearly long-nosed or long-upper-lipped. By contrast, a ceremonial bar held by a seated personage, perhaps a priest-king (halach uinic or ahau), portrays this subject un- ambiguously in a Late Classic Maya frieze (fig. 42). Each end of the bar terminates in a human head characterized by a long upper lip or proboscis, identified as that of the Maya "long- nosed god" or "God B," known more accurately as Chaac or Chicchan. In the Maya codices (Tro-Cortesiano 5a; see also Villacorta and Villacorta 1977:230-35), this god is clearly equated with a gigantic serpent, his alter ego. Maya religion recognized four fearsome Chaacs or Chicchans, each occupy- ing one of the four celestial corners, and lightning, thunder, and rain were regarded as consequences of their angry shout- ing at each other (Thompson 1970:262-65). The double-headed serpent was important in the art of the plateau cultures of Mexico. An elegant, turquoise-studded pec- toral that portrays it almost naturalistically and devoid of a central motif on its body was worn by the Aztec emperor Mon- tezuma. More important, the agrarian, bisexual deity Cinteotl and the major ophidian goddess of the Mexica, Coatlicue, the "mother of the human race," are generally represented wearing a double-headed serpent for a belt. A famous, massive statue of the latter goddess is anthropomorphic but has double rattle- snake heads joined mouth to mouth (Fernandez 1959). In an- other image, discussed by Arana (1967), the escutcheon on Coatlicue's belt-only this detail is shown in figure 43- depicts a death mask or human skull, its "jaw" represented by a simple U with double bifid terminations that disclose their ophidian identity just as subtly as the Eskimo and Haida masks in figures 27, 30, and 34, the Arapaho Thunderbird in figure 36, and the Zunli masks in figures 37 and 38. Variations of the double-headed serpent motif are almost limitless as deco- rations on pottery, sculpture, and textiles in Mesoamerica even 464 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="15">Mundkur: THE BICEPHALOUS "ANIMAL STYLE today. Weitlaner-Johnson (1976:13) describes a common em- broidered pattern on a relatively recent quechquemitl (wom- an's shoulder cape) from Colotlan, Jalisco, Mexico. Animals other than the serpent-such as a double-human-headed eagle incorporating a moon, or a vegetation, deity (Beyer 1965: 461)-are both infrequent and exceptional in Aztec art (fig. 44). However, the fact that ancient, Preclassic Mexican ceramic figurines from Tlatilco also represent humans as dou- ble-headed suggests that all these variations were part of a style in which the popularity of motifs of other animal species was waning, if indeed these species were once important in the earliest, undocumented cults and art of this region. Bicephalous motifs are encountered as far south as the Andes, where decorative, hybridized avian, feline, and reptil- ian forms abound, especially from the late pre-Christian era up to the Spanish conquest. Two examples chosen out of many illustrated by Kauffmann Doig (1973) will suffice to underline the numinous associations. The first is the focal subject on the Sun Portal at Tiahuanaco in Bolivia, a divinity who bears bicephalic condor/serpent/feline emblems; the second is repre- sented by innumerable images of the Andean god or culture hero Ai Apaec, whose emblem is the double-headed serpent. One of the farthest points attained by a bicephalic symbol in South America may be near Kotosh, Peru. Here, especially during the earlier periods, images of the serpent are more in evidence than clear-cut feline ones. Apparently, the serpent was a cult animal the history of whose veneration in the An- dean region probably antedates any known archaeological relic. At Kotosh, during a period in which feline motifs are rarely present or recognizable, anthropomorphic designs on ceramics are "very rare, but the one known representation of a human figure holding [what appears to be a double-headed] snake is notable" (Izumi 1971: figs. 6, 7b, 8b, 8c; Izumi and Sono 1963:157, pl. 122-17). A double-headed serpent is plainly depicted on a cotton textile of the 3d millennium B.C. (Izumi and Terada 1972; 140, fig. 182). It is possible that future stud- ies of the art of even earlier aboriginal cultures elsewhere in South America could provide the data for firmer generaliza- tions than are justifiable now. DISCUSSION Despite their religious overtones, bicephalous motifs constitute only a small fraction of the "animal-style" art. In the monu- mental rock art of the Scandinavian Stone Age, for instance, conspicuously few double-headed individuals occur amid herds of elk. Nonetheless, I agree with Hallstrom, whom I have already quoted, that their significance should not be mini- mized. Elsewhere in the world, too, there are symbols whose low recorded frequencies at times bear little relationship to the actual cultic importance of the animal they represent (Mund- kur 1983:35-39, 98, 128, 157, 161). In the regions that concern us most, however, it is hard to determine whether, or why, conspicuously bicephalic images of early date are less abun- dant than, say, in Northwest Coast Indian art of recent times. Such deficiencies in the archaeological record may be real or fortuitous. Once cataloged, perhaps with noncommittal de- scriptions, certain artifacts sometimes seem to command little further attention simply because their appeal to the imagina- tion is less than that of others or because they are abstract and shadowy symbols whose significances in a people's religious beliefs or customs cannot be accurately gauged. Furthermore, whim and conservatism have always coexisted precariously in the symbol maker's repertoire. Factors such as these are chal- lenging enough to area specialists. The student of religious art who attempts temporally and ethnologically wide-ranging comparisons cannot but rely-though not exclusively-on cur- rently favored views about human migrational patterns in antiquity, seek out specimens for their potential places in cross- cultural schemes, and indicate the value of one or another elemental criterion for judging early art vis-a-vis the mythol- ogy and symbolism of recent epochs. Works of art, however, are apt to impel varied interpreta- tions simply because they impress different observers in differ- ent ways. Trigger (1982:2, 4), who examines overlapping goals in research, finds that "material culture is one topic that eth- nologists have notoriously neglected in recent years," so that "archaeologists still find it necessary to undertake ethnographic studies to remedy a lack of ethnological work that is relevant to their needs." It is hardly surprising that though religious art and the secular motifs inspired by it are an important part of material culture, they have commanded insufficientfocal inter- disciplinary attention. This is unfortunate, for the ethnology, palaeoecology, and archaeology of the upper boreal regions have aroused much interest (Binford 1962, 1978; Gjessing 1975; Hopkins et al. 1983). So too, alas, has the latitude for theorizing available in psychological approaches. Jungian psychoanalysts-who are seldom guided by ar- chaeology and ethnology-might argue that the widespread human tendency to envision certain natural phenomena as bi- nary opposites and create pictorial symbols of these betokens a "collective consciousness" rather than conservatism rooted in the superstitions of early hunting peoples and their descen- dants. This argument may seem especially attractive because the serpent-to which Jung (1968:247-48) assigns a central symbolical role as an "archetype"-has loomed prominently in our discussion, but I have elsewhere stated at length my rea- sons for repudiating this view (Mundkur 1983:262-72). Jung's precepts, however, merit attention anew in the present context largely because they have been disavowed even from an art historical perspective by scholars who are not in principle averse to the psychological study of pictorial or sculptural rep- resentations. Gombrich's (1961:102-3) "sympathies are all with those who warn us against rash speculations about inborn reactions in man-whether they come from the racialist camp or that of Jung.... Our twin nature, poised between animality and rationality, finds expression in that twin world of symbol- ism with its willing suspension of disbelief. " Ehrenzweig (1967:xiv, 181, 290), though partial to Jung's "dynamic view" of "archetypes" vis-'a-vis "unconscious phantasy" in symbol making, admits that his own work as an art critic was "not really helped by Rank, Graves or Jung. The stratification of pedagogic imagery is too complex for that." Kris (1962:82) dis- misses Jung's postulates less punctiliously. Whether or not structuralist viewpoints based on ethnology are more persuasive than those derived from psychoanalytical theory is moot, at least with respect to graphic and sculptural art. Layton (1981:93-97) opines that Levi-Strauss's general view on art objects as visual communicators is a "major mis- take" and his "sweeping judgement" on individualization a "fallacy." Layton (pp. 151-60) summarizes other views such as those of Boas (1955), Deregowski (1971), and Morphy (1977), all of whom give special attention to the peculiarities of "split representation" in Northwest Coast art. Levi-Strauss (1963:245-66), too, considers these peculiarities, preferring to "appeal to psychology or the structural analysis of forms . .. to understand [certain] parallel recurrences whose frequency and cohesion cannot possibly be the result of chance. " He considers mostly Northwest Coast, Shang Chinese, Maori, and Caduveo art but takes no clear stand on diffusion versus independent invention. He refers only fleetingly and superficially to ar- chaeology but in the end does concede the possibility of "a diffusion of organic wholes wherein style, esthetic convention, social organization, and religion are structurally related." The latter statement strikes me as quite reasonable, particularly with regard to northern Eurasia and the Americas, except that esthetic conventions and the psychological analysis of visual Vol. 25 * No. 4 * August-October 1984 465</page><page sequence="16">forms have no place in my viewpoint. Nor do "cognitive prin- ciples" such as those erected by Vastokas (1978) with special reference to sisiutl. To Vastokas (pp. 25 7-58), bipartite North- west Coast art-she considers no other regional art-embodies in visual terms the tension between opposites, the pull of conflicting visual forces. Northwest Coast cognition seems an amalgam of con- tending drives for free untrammeled movement and for stability and rest. Visual images, therefore, reveal themselves as mechanisms for the expression of these latent cultural-cognitive tensions, the rivalry be- tween one principle of order and another and a striving for integration and balance, never perfectly achieved.... In the visual phenomenon of bilateral symmetry, the median axis [competes] for importance with the two lateral extensions. The same is true for the tripartite sisiutl image whose human head functions as a pivotal centre between two unstable and moving parts. In the configuration of the simultaneous image, these dual and triple organizations interact in a perceptually dynamic way, the observer's eye moving between stability at the centre and lateral movement. So also two-dimensional design [reveals] a vi- sual tension between rigidly conceived and executed quadrilateral shapes and free calligraphic "formlines." And in architectural mi- crocosmic symbolism, ritual movement [is] established with continual reference to vertical and horizontal axes. That movement, however, reached its climax at a single point, at the intersection of the two axes, the point of ultimate stability and equilibrium.... Such is the underly- ing, fundamental meaning of the cognitive apparatus we call art in Northwest Coast society.... Interpretations of this kind are-prudently, in my opinion- avoided in art historical treatises on the "animal style" such as those of Charriere (1971), Jettmar (1964), Lommel (1967), and Rostovtzeff (1929), among others, but, unlike Vastokas, these authors mention the bicephalous forms only briefly and practi- cally ignore their special relevance to the tribal spirit world. Moreover, they are conspicuously short of early relics. Lom- mel's handsome illustrations, for instance, are set against a background of far-reaching conclusions involving psychology, the "beginnings of art," and the diffusion of the "X-ray style" to areas as far afield as Australia. His generalizations, for the most part, have been received sceptically (see CA 11:39-74). Miller's (1955, 1972) treatments of North American Indian religion emphasize concepts of duality from philosophical and human ecological viewpoints but not primarily against a back- ground of art or cross-culturally with reference to Eurasia. Grieder (1982) treats pre-Columbian art as if it were a product of three "basic waves" of immigrants and touches upon animal (including ophidian/feline) symbols, chiefly belonging to the "third wave," but gives no sustained attention to any particu- lar facet of the cultic histories of New World and northern Eurasian aborigines. My own perspective, admittedly, must cope with certain shortcomings. First and foremost, integrative focus on biceph- alous zoomorphic art is rare in ethnoarchaeology, perhaps be- cause the factors that motivate the creation of a particular emblem are difficult to explain in sociopsychological terms or because its bipartite design itself is sometimes as obscure as its meaning. Second, the archaeological relics of arctic and sub- arctic peoples are meager compared with those of their south- ern neighbors and tend to obscure their prehistoric migratory or settlement patterns and their determinative influences on religion and the crafts, as Hultkrantz (1965), Simonsen (1965), and Bakka (1975) indicate. Nevertheless, it is doubtful that animal symbols differ drastically over the millennia insofar as they express fundamental human sentiments about a few se- lected species. About 1000 B.C., when southern Norway was already affected by Bronze Age European influences, a pure Stone Age hunting culture (or cultures) flourished in the ex- treme north near arctic fjords where the Barents Sea and the moorlands meet. Here, the finds from the settlement at Gras- bakken include an antler comb with zigzags etched on its tines and a pair of heads on long, projecting necks carved in the round from its grip. One of these is unquestionably a bird's head, the other seemingly an eel's or a serpent's (Hagen 1967:74, fig. 24). The artistic pairing of species, however, is widely attested long before the Bronze Age both in Europe and in Asia. What are the antecedents of this style, which is but a corollary of the human tendency to conceptualize binary asso- ciations of all sorts? According to Hallstrom (1960:372), the earliest recorded pet- roglyphs of elks at Namforsen "cannot be traced either back- wards or forwards in time." Human habitation of this region, he suggests, could not have begun until the Jamtland ice-lake was drained during the final stage of the last glacial, about 8,700 years ago, opening the way for a rich faunal develop- ment and "the truly remarkable distribution of this rock art." But some, he writes, date the Namforsen carvings to between 3800 and 3125 B.C. This helps us little, and the question it sidetracks-namely, the possibility of the much greater antiq- uity and broader distribution of the bicephalous animal style- merits attention, for it is unknown exactly how early the coastal regions and hinterland of Norway and Sweden (at the latitude of Namforsen) witnessed the interaction of European (Nordic) peoples and the Lapps, or Same. The prehistory of the Lapps is hazy. They seem to be allied in some ways to the Voguls (or Mansi) of northwestern Siberia. Their words for shaman are noai'de and niait, respectively, and Lapp shamanic and sacrificial rites, according to Mebius (1968:185-88), have a "great affinity" to those of the Yurak Samoyeds, Ob-Ugrians, and even Altaic peoples much farther to the east in Siberia. Double-headed zoomorphs adorn the drums of shamans of quite unrelated Siberian tribes. Qanym, a major double-headed animal-spirit protector of the taiga hunter and the chief feature on shamans' drums among various Altaic ethnic groups, was rarely, if ever, represented anthropo- morphically until the early part of this century (Potapov 1968:212, 220-33, fig. 10). In common with many other peo- ples of the tundra and taiga that venerate cervids, the pre- Christian Lapps attached great symbolic value to antlers. For instance, the seite, their supreme cult object of amorphous stone or wood (the latter occasionally a carved "double- headed" tree stump), was customarily worshipped on an altar ringed with reindeer antlers (Scheffer 1704[1673]:108; Karsten 1955: fig. 1, 7). Thus it is important to observe the conven- tional symbols on the Lapp shaman's most characteristic ef- fects, his magic drum and the bifurcate drumstick which, typi- cally, is carved out of antler. Especially in the older specimens, the drum membrane features not only double-headed or paired reindeer with prominent antlers (or antlers alone) and occa- sionally elk, but also zigzag lines that sometimes bifurcate at both ends. These zigzags, which may also be incised on the drumstick, represent the noidekdrmai, the shaman's powerful spirit assistant-a serpent, which species the Lapps ordinarily detest. Figures 45 and 46 exemplify, respectively, a sepulchral grotto and a few of the many variations of both ophidian and cervine symbols on Lapp drums. These and other ritual objects in figures 47-52 are discussed in detail by Manker (1938: figs. 25, 532, 563; 1950: 27-30, 139-440). The Lapp shaman's bifurcate drumstick has a visual, and probably functional, analogue in one of the several types of ceremonial objects (fig. 54) from the Neolithic cemetery of the 2d millennium B.C. at Olenii, an island in northern Lake Onega, northwestern Russia (Gurina 1956). This is a small implement shaped from antler that is the more intriguing be- cause among the grave goods of the same material are repre- sentations of serpents and elk heads. The latter seem to portray either young or female elk, which lack antlers. Anthropologi- cally, the significance of the burials at Olenii is that, while most of the skeletons are of an ancient Europeoid (Cro- Magnon) type, there are also skulls with Mongoloid features. Evidently, man settled in northwestern Russia from both the south and the northeast, just as he did in upper Scandinavia. Thus, though cervids are the more visible and apt candi- dates for attention as natural symbols of taiga and tundra, the 466 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="17">ARMA l~~~ n ? \ c @e~~ /4I t i 51 4548 49 5 0 46 1 . .... . ..'.'.'.... .

Vol. 25 No. 4 * August-October 1984 467</page><page sequence="18">rare and merely seasonal serpent's simultaneous impingement on human sensitivities seems to have been both widespread and ancient. I shall elaborate on these aspects with respect to Eurasia before considering the Western Hemisphere. Whether the traditions in which both cervine and ophidian symbols are important originated in "Europe" or "Asia" is ob- scure. At H0stad, Norway, about 350 km south of the Arctic Circle (at about the same latitude as Namforsen), certain vo- tive objects were found whose makers may have been either Lapp or Nordic. Radiocarbon-dated to ca. 500 B.C., they oc- cupy a "very isolated position" amid the Norwegian material as a whole. One of the H0stad finds (fig. 56) is a wooden "stool(?)" carved in low relief to show two opposed pairs of elk heads, each of which is joined to its mate by a serpentine body. "The faces of the animals are not modelled to any Central European pattern; on the contrary we see a clear connection with the traditions of animal representations followed by the late hunters' cultures of the North, " writes Marstrander (1967:41-44, fig. 13). Important examples of double elk heads with serpentine bodies rather suggestive of the H0stad animals are known from Bronze Age Denmark, whence Glob (1974:116-67) describes numerous stag, antler, and serpent motifs of cultic significance. There are bronze images of an antler-headed deity and of a female divinity whose chief attri- bute is a "horned" serpent. The Celtic god Cernunnos's chief animal symbols-an antler headdress, the stag, and a "horned" serpent-are prominent in the decoration on the Gundestrup silver cauldron, one of the most significant of Dan- ish Iron Age finds (Olmsted 1979). Binary associations of cervids (or their antlers) with the ser- pent are equally noteworthy in much earlier periods: "Engrav- ings of animals are rare" on bone and antler found in the Early Postglacial settlements of South Scandinavia, but according to Clark (1975:151-52, fig. 33) "they include finely incised fish and serpents." One such specimen, from Skalstrup, Denmark, is a piece of red-deer antler engraved with two zigzags, one of which has a clearly visible knob at the tip to indicate a reptile's head. This piece is clearly an amulet, for it has a pair of perfo- rations for a suspension cord. Farther south, at the Late Stone Age Danubian site of Lepenski Vir, graves dated to 5275 B.C. and earlier are con- spicuously poor in funerary offerings, but, according to Sre- jovic (1972:104, 120-23, pl. 12, 13), "one rule was always respected: stag's antlers were regularly placed alongside the skeleton . . . [as] an essential part of the funeral ritual." In addition, the Lepenski Vir relics include a sandstone effigy of a "snake . . . [seemingly] a magic instrument in the hands of the person who healed members of the community from the bites of poisonous snakes" and also an antler whose "upper part merging into the sinuous body of a snake [ends] in the realistic- ally carved head of some [other] animal. . . ." Boroneant (1972:111-13) describes a deer antler of the Epipalaeolithic Schela Cladovei culture of Rumania, apparently an amulet grooved at one end for suspension by a thong, with clear-cut serpent motifs incised on two of its sides (fig. 58). Caprids and serpents figure in low relief on mortuary pottery of the Early Neolithic Gumelnita and Starcevo-Cri? cultures of southeast- ern Europe (Nitu 1972: figs. 2[5], 13). A piece of antler from the caves at Lorthet in the French Pyrenees is artificially shaped almost to conform to the outlines of a serpent with protruding bifid tongue naturalistically incised on its surface. The reptile is plump in the middle and tapered at the ends (as is the antler) and, judging from the circles, or eggs, incised adja- cent to it, represented as gravid. The incisions are partially polished and worn in the middle of this motif rather than at the extremities, suggesting that this antler (Middle Magdalenian, ca. 11,000 B.C.) was a much handled ritual object (Marshack 1972:223). Associations of cervine (or other animal) and ophi- dian symbols such as these have not yet been systematically documented. 58 FIGS. 58, 59. East and West European zoomorphic symbols: 58, piece of deer antler, Epipalaeolithic Schela Cladovei culture, Rumania, notched at one end for suspension as an amulet. Knobbed zigzag en- gravings on two of its sides represent serpents (after Boroneant 1972); 59, pierced batons or fragments of batons, antler, with bipartite and paired symbols, Magdalenian, French Pyrenees, including bicephalic, naturalistic bison from La Madeleine (top left); stylized bison heads, paired at one end of a pierced baton, its other extremity representing a phallus, from Laugerie-Basse (center); two faces of a fragment of a pierced baton showing a pair of engraved bison heads on one face and, on the reverse, two horse heads, a serpent, and a man, from La Madeleine (right); and a baton shaped like a bison's head at the pierced end, the surface engraved with an antlered reindeer head, from Laugerie-Basse (bottom) (all after Leroi-Gourhan 1983). How far back in time can one trace sentiments that signify dualism through art? The "oldest known" abstract bipartite symbol or bicephalous zoomorphic image of obvious cultic significance and the identity of its makers are difficult to ascer- tain partly because of the confluence or proximity of quite disparate peoples. At the island cemetery of Olenii in north- western Russia, as we have seen, the skeletal remains comprise (Cro-Magnon) European as well as Mongoloid types. In central Siberia, "typical" animal-style art-chiefly of the Tagar period (6th-4th century B.C.), popularized in art books because of its esthetic appeal and its relative abundance-developed in the Minusinsk Basin during the Bronze Age in the wake of two totally unrelated Eneolithic cultures, the Afanasievo and the Okunev. While the bearers of the former were palaeo- Europeans, those of the latter were Mongoloid, and the simi- larity of certain grave goods from the Middle Ob River area and from the Lake Baikal region suggests that they came to the south from the northern Siberian taiga. Unfortunately, though they do include zooanthropomorphs, we know little about Okunev cultic art and even less about Afanasievo (Chard 468 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="19">-3 u 61 60 4 t (lfla E 5' EI \ I n ' I I I /~~~6' , FIGS. 60-65.

However, as Leroi- Gourhan (1983:84-86, translation mine)4 observes, there is in Palaeolithic Europe an extraordinary unity of figurative content; the apparent meaning of images does not seem to have varied from 30,000 to 9,000 years before our era and remains the same from Asturias to the Don.... Europe at that time would already have constituted a vast cultural fabric, varied in details but homogeneous as a whole.... apart from the region of Lake Baikal, where the records are quite comparable to those of the west, [the unity] begins at the Urals and extends to the Atlantic. There is, writes Leroi-Gourhan (1983:93-139), a clear ten- dency in the cave art of the Dordogne and Pyrenean regions of France to represent different animal species in binary associa- tions, either as individuals (often gravid) or as groups, in faith- ful portraiture as well as through signs. A third species, includ- ing man, may be involved, though without detracting from the apparently fundamental tendency towards binary groupings. His frequency analyses (p. 108) indicate that "the central theme of Palaeolithic art is indisputably a binary theme associating the horse with the bison or wild ox. This animal theme is duplicated by the signs, which occupy the same position . .. or an analogous situation [as they also echo] a binary theme."5 "l'extraordinaire unite du contenu figuratif; le sens apparent des images ne semble pas avoir varie de -30,000 a -9,000 avant notre ere et reste le meme aux Asturies et sur le Don.... L'Europe d'alors con- stituait deja une nappe culturelle tres vaste, varie dans ses details, mais homogene dans son ensemble. . . . Si l'on fait abstraction de la region du lac Baikal oui les documents sont d'ailleurs tres comparables a ceux d'Occident, il debute a l'Oural et s'etend jusqu'a l'Atlantique." s "Le theme central de l'art paleolithique est donc indiscutablement un theme binaire associant le cheval au bison ou au boeuf sauvage. Ce theme animalier est double par les signes, qui occupent la meme posi- tion (I) ou une situation analogue (II), signes repondant eux aussi a une theme binaire. ..." Other species, such as the reindeer, the bear, and the mam- moth, also figure in these wall paintings but in lower frequen- cies. It is, however, the pierced batons of antler and mam- moth, aurochs, or other bone that deserve special attention. Perforated beneath the fork, the Y shapes of some of these batons derive from sculptured figures of, or stylized symbols for, animals, chiefly the bison, which appears bicephalous when addorsed (fig. 59). The batons may also bear engravings, and these, too, generally occur in pairs-reindeer and bison, horse and serpent, bison heads, etc. Such pierced batons, writes Leroi-Gourhan (pp. 129-3 1), comprise "the most impor- tant category. . . . It is certain in all cases that the pierced baton was a very important object and very intimately inte- grated with Palaeolithic symbolism."6 I agree, but share Ucko and Rosenfeld's (1967:141-48, 195-221, 241 n.1, 14) distaste for his generalized sexual interpretations. Human figures are not common in southern French cave- wall art (Leroi-Gourhan 1965). However, images of males in "dancing" postures (at Les Trois Freres, Ariege) are notewor- thy because the Magdalenian cult sentiments they capture are just as eloquently echoed in the rites of modern Siberian sha- mans, whose headdress frequently consists of antlers or an iron crown that mimics them. One of the images is human-bodied, but its horned, bison head and the piece of bison skin and tail on the "dancer" 's back clearly identify him with this animal. The other, the so-called sorcerer, is perhaps one of the most celebrated of Magdalenian animal cult images. This has the body of a hoofed animal (it has a horse's tail), human fore- and hindlimbs, a nondescript but almost human face, and antlers atop its head. 6 "[Les batons perce sont] la categorie la plus importante .... II est certain en tous cas que le baton perce etait un objet tres important et integre au plus intime de la symbolique paleolithique." Vol. 25 * No. 4 * August-October 1984 469</page><page sequence="20">For all these reasons, I venture to suggest-especially vis-a- vis the parts of northern Eurasia to which bison and horses are not native-that if a primordial, unifying element exists amid the forest of graphic symbols and ritual objects that convey a sense of spiritual dualism and human links with the animal world, the model that inspired it can be found in the pecu- liarities of the antler. Basically, the antlers of all cervids are alike but for their shape, which is characteristic for each species. They are borne as appendages of the skull only by adult males, except for the reindeer (Rangifer tarandus, or caribou in North America), both sexes of which carry them. A thin skin filled with blood vessels supporting short velvet-like hairs covers the bony cores of young antlers. After the core attains maximum size, this covering is sloughed off-almost as a serpent sheds its skin. Antlers then serve as sexual ornaments and weapons, but they are shed after the mating season and regenerated annually. Above all, they are paired and constitute mirror images of each other as they bifurcate progressively three or more times dur- ing growth. The reindeer's long, sweeping beams and forward projecting brow tines end in flat, palmate forms that are partic- ularly impressive in many adult males. Durable as the dead animal's skull, antlers are fairly easy to shape and have served eminently as material for primitive man's implements. The tundra reindeer had a subboreal forest variety and also a dis- puted taxonomic ally (R. arcticus) during the Palaeolithic, when, as Burch (1972) shows in detail, this genus must have played an inestimably important role in man's subsistence economy. Prized as quarry, reindeer, red deer, elk, and other cervids are apt to have been, in Levi-Strauss's words, bons a penser, "good to think about"-perhaps as much as the repul- sive serpent-as mortuary and other customs attest. Inadequacies in the archaeological data notwithstanding, the importance of Alaska as a key link in the migration of conjoint symbols is apparent from all the above information and Himmelheber's (1953:125) discussion of several themes in Eskimo art which involve the association of reindeer with an- other species, including a fantastic palraiyuk-like creature. While it is not surprising that the latter's ophidian nature is hazy and inferential, even reindeer and mountain sheep are not especially outstanding in Bering Sea Eskimo art, though they figure importantly in myth: Raven created man and mountain sheep before he created wolf-toothed reindeer. This species is represented amidst innumerable others through masks and painted vessels, but its numinous role is hardly so special as, for instance, in Lapp sacrificial and mortuary customs and shamans' drums. Yet, binary reindeer motifs in which one of the animals in a symbolically linked pair is the other's inua or ancestor spirit are not unknown in Eskimo art of the period preceding European contact (fig. 60). Abstract bifurcate designs on antler occur at several ancient Alaskan sites. Some from Ipiutak are extraordinary in being crudely etched on small flat pebbles. They prompted Giddings (1977:147-49) to wonder whether they "possibly symbolize prayers or divinations" and even to surmise questionable "other relationships" with peoples culturally quite unrelated. Giddings's "first impression was that the drawings represented a reindeer covered fore and aft with antlers," in other words, a bicephalous reindeer whose "legs," he thought, were also rec- ognizable (fig. 61). He seems to have been unaware, however, that such forms have stylistic analogues in northern Eurasian art, for he later reidentified the antlers as trees and envisioned the possibility of two visual parallels: "tree designs . . . on ancient coins of India" and "ideographs . . . on the surfaces of oracular or augury bones" of the Shang period in China (ca. 1500 B.c.). Treatises on these archaic ideographs such as Chang's (1970) do not in my opinion sustain this sanguine com- parison. I am inclined to believe that Giddings's first impres- sion was correct, for, on careful observation, one can clearly discern in some of these etchings the forward-projecting brow tines that typify the reindeer antler. This is evident in two of the pebbles in figure 61, where the artist has etched tiny circles at the antler tips, probably to indicate the palmate termina- tions of the antlers of most adult male reindeer. These Ipiutak pebble motifs, then, are analogous to, and in visual and genetic terms seemingly derived from, such Eurasian creatures as the bicephalous taiga-spirit Qanym represented on the Altaic sha- man's drum handle, the elk in the Namforsen petroglyphs, and the reindeer on the Lapp shaman's drum membrane. Further- more, abstract Y symbols are known not only in Eskimo art as a whole but also, as we have noted, in the ritual art of the Lapps. Instances like these are an incentive for closing gaps of the kind which iconographers now experience in many regions. For example, the art of Ipiutak, dating to about the early Christian era, resembles that of Iron Age cultures of northern Siberia and Europe far to the west of Bering Strait. Yet, in northeastern Siberia, much closer to Ipiutak, Soviet ar- chaeologists have found richly decorated objects of the Okvik and Old Bering Sea cultures (earliest phase, ca. 350 B.C.) that bear no traces of Ipiutak art (Collins 1977:11, 13; Taylor 1971). Now, Henry Collins, in his introduction to the late Louis Giddings's (1977) account of archaeological discoveries in Alaska, argues succinctly and persuasively for the view that the Eskimo have deep roots in northern Eurasia, with the early Siberian Neolithic of the Lake Baikal area as an intermediary stage; bone and ivory arrowheads and lances of the Ipiutak Eskimo, with stone blades inserted in the sides, are directly comparable to the side-bladed implements of the European Mesolithic and Siberian Neolithic. The two most important features of the Denbigh Flint complex and its antecedents- burins and microblades-are also characteristic of the Old World Mesolithic and Palaeolithic. Furthermore, the Denbigh Flint complex "may have been related in some way to early Paleo-Indian cultures of western North America, and shared certain features in common with early Eskimo cultures in the Arctic." Giddings (1963:19-20), in the light of his own prelimi- nary work at Onion Portage (now fully documented [see Gid- dings and Anderson n.d.]), leans towards Collins's view and the "implication that Athapascan culture and language may be even older than Eskimo in the Arctic." The importance of Onion Portage, on the Kobuk River in Alaska, is that the site is in the path of a reindeer crossing where, every year for thousands of years during the migrations of herds between the coast and the interior, Eskimo hunted them almost to the point of extinction. 7 It is unfortunate, there- fore, that this stratigraphically significant site-the deepest in Alaska, with hearths and artifacts in a succession of layers corresponding to continuous encampments of possibly differ- ent peoples-has yielded no useful zoomorphic art from the older layers. Implements of antler are many but badly cor- roded. The finds are as yet unpublished but were kindly opened for my perusal by Douglas Anderson and Ruth Gid- dings of the Haffenreffer Museum of Brown University. The only relevant, perfectly preserved object I came across is rela- tively recent, from Level 4, Band 1. This is an antler comb, probably ceremonial because it is too tiny (20 mm wide) to have been utilitarian (fig. 62). The miniature figures engraved on it comprise two hunters with bows, two mammals (moun- tain sheep, musk ox?), and two fish. To my knowledge, this is the only specimen that recalls, if tenuously, European Stone Age representations of species in pairs as described by Leroi- Gourhan, Marshack, and others. As I have said, artistic license and conservatism have coex- 7 Reindeer had been practically exterminated in western Alaska be- fore Edward W.

In addition to tribal whim, many temporal and ecological fac- tors are reflected in the variable emphases different species receive as partners, be they represented bicephalously or as dissociated individuals. In North America, antlered (and by extension, horned) species continue to be important, but pro- gressively southward it is the serpent that reasserts its hold on the human imagination. Thus, the deer and/or mountain goat have important legendary roles among the Kwakiutl and Bella Coola, respectively, but are almost eclipsed by the serpent- which, as the double-headed sisiutl motif on shamans' "soul catchers," wands, headdresses, rattles, and other parapher- nalia, commands far greater numinous power even though venomous reptiles are unknown and harmless ones only sea- sonal in tribal domains (Boas 1932:196; 1935:146-48, 153-54; McIlwraith 1948:300, 330, 529). In the United States, Plains Indians of diverse tribes retain strong ophidian traditions, though we tend to typify their "medicine men" as wearers of bison-horn headdresses. In ancient Mexican religions in gen- eral, the serpent was venerated far more than any cervid or caprid. The deer figures importantly, however, in the Maya and Nahua codices, sometimes to symbolize thirst and drought overpowered by the rain god Chaac (figs. 66, 67) but oftener as a sacrificial gift to pluvial, terrestrial, agricultural, and fire deities-notably Chaac, Tohil, Lahun Chan, Tlaloc, Mix- coatl, and Xiuhcoatl, all of whom are ophidian (Montoliu 1976-77; Thompson 1972:100, 106). Unfortunately, the prehistory of these symbols is no better known than that of the Alaskan ones. Human occupation at Tlapacoya, in central Mexico, dates back to before 20,000 B.C., but there are no finds here or elsewhere in Mexico either of dissociated cervine-ophidian symbols or of bicephalous cer- vids comparable in age to those of Middle or Late Stone Age Eurasia. At Tlatilco, near Tlapacoya, zoomorphic images are less impressive during the Early to Middle Formative periods (2000-1700 B.C.) than double-headed or two-faced fertility- cult figurines of naked women. Comparable figurines are scarcely encountered at Tlatilco or elsewhere in Mexico during subsequent periods (Pinia Chan 1958). Thus it is remarkable that tomb sherds excavated at Capacha, near the central Pacific Coast of Mexico (radiocarbon-dated to 1870-1720 B.C.), suggest relationships not only with central Mexican sites, including Tlatilco, but possibly also with northwestern South America. The problems of establishing these relationships, which may be considerably older than these sherds, have been addressed by Grove (1971), Meggers and Evans (1969), and Furst (1965). In these contexts, Kelly (1980:7, 100 n. 7) calls special attention to the bicephalous serpent motif in terms that I concur with entirely: "The serpent with a head at each end," she writes, was "a potential augury of death. . . . Accord- ingly-if an immense break in time, space, and probably cul- ture be permitted-the double-headed snake might be a fitting motif for funerary ware . .. [and its] prevalence in Mexico and Peru [suggests that] a detailed comparative study including representations, associations, and chronological position might be rewarding." In Mesoamerica, from about a century or two before the Christian era on, there is no dearth of obvious double-headed serpent motifs and-chiefly at Teotihuacan-of bird-serpent, jaguar-serpent, and bird-serpent-jaguar combinants, but, as individuals, birds and jaguars are very rarely represented bicephalously. Frequently, however, double-headed serpent motifs are so abstract or cryptic that they are noted in treatises on "art appreciation" per se and serve the narrower goals of the local cataloger more easily than they have stimulated system- atic international inquiries of the kind Kelly and I, and surely others, espouse. The obstacles posed by ornate subject matter may be exemplified by the Leyden Plate, a small flat jade relic whose great importance stems from the Maya calendrical hieroglyphs and exact date engraved on one of its sides (Morley and Morley 1939). The other side of this relic (fig. 68) shows a personage, perhaps a priest-ruler. The ceremonial bar in his folded arms is bicephalous but entirely obscured by the elabo- rate decoration around it, so that, in order to be properly identified as Chaac emblematized, it must be isolated from the principal image and partly reconstructed, as Seler (1915:39) has done. In ancient Peru, the "Staff God," like Chaac an ophidian thunder and rain deity, is, according to Rowe (1967:86), the only major deity of Chavin religion whom we can recognize as having more than local importance. Yet, he assumes obscure forms. In Chavin cotton textile designs studied by Cordy-Collins (1979), the cotton plant, of which the "Staff God" is guardian spirit, is zooanthropomorphized in his image: his face represents its stem, while his chief attribute, the double-headed serpent, represents its roots (figs. 69, 70). Cases like these abound in religious art, and systematic search for them in pottery motifs and sequences, textile designs, and sculptures from regions far afield would appreciably enhance comparative studies. Despite our knowledge of human migrations to the Western Hemisphere millennia before the submergence of the Beringian landmass, however, the difficulties of applying the potential power of comparative iconography are clear enough. To envi- sion (with little or no support for this criterion from other disciplines) direct trans-Pacific contacts between North Ameri- can indigenes and Asians, chiefly the Chinese during their his- toric period, is to invite scepticism. Is there a basis for postulating a late diffusion, after 1500 B.C., of Shang/Chou-period religious (or decorative) art to re- gions extending from Alaska to the Olmec heartland in Mex- ico? Or of Hindu art styles to Mesoamerica? I doubt it. The genetic characteristics of Chinese or Hindu and Eskimo/ Amerindian populations militate against such speculations as gravely as the logistic impediments to the transplantation (es- pecially in the absence of miscegenation) of complex facets of religious culture by distant civilized peoples even if, for the sake of argument, one concedes the plausibility of their trans- Pacific voyages.8 Either noncommittally or to suggest the oc- currence of such maritime contacts, details of embellishment in ornate works of Chinese and Amerindian art have been singled out for comparison as "striking similarities," which to some (Badner 1963, Davis and Davis 1975, Jett 1983, Shao 1976) they may be. Portrayals of "corn" and elephants in the elabo- rately ornamental details of the Hindu/Buddhist sculpture of India and Indianized South Asia have also been submitted as "parallels" to Mesoamerican works, but their "striking similarities," as I have shown (Mundkur 1980), are spurious. Thus, art per se does not impress me as primary evidence of Chinese and South Asian cultural impact on New World peo- ples. There is, of course, no reason that details of ornate art should not be considered, although, as the Leyden Plate and the Sutton Hoo dragon demonstrate, they impose more con- straints than elementary motifs. Proponents of trans-Pacific diffusions who detect "similarities" of ornamental detail from a purely artistic viewpoint, however, have not tried to explore in extenso any one particular unifying theme that involves a par- ticular symbol or symbols or facets of ecology, subsistence, human sensitivity to an animal species, or mortuary and other religious customs with common moorings in the remote past. Some important animals-certainly the tiger in Siberia-are rarely portrayed as bicephalous. Extensive catalogs of archaic Chinese bronze belt-hooks and jade objects include many specimens in the form of fantastic creatures such as birds and 8 McEwan and Dickson (1978) present a sceptical nautical view regarding (hypothetical) trans-Pacific voyages in the 3d millennium B.C. by Japanese of the Middle Jomon period to Valdivia, coastal Ecuador.

Clear-cut feline motifs are common in Mesoamerica and Andean South America, but it is difficult to identify an exclusively feline deity, though double- headed felines are not unknown. "Feline" identity is often questionably emphasized, as de la Fuente (1981:85) convinc- ingly argues with respect to Olmec art. The same is frequently true of early Andean fantastic hybrids, whose feline qualities are no more noteworthy than their fanged human, avian, and ophidian ones. By contrast, purely double-headed serpent motifs were widespread in the hinterland of both the Americas almost certainly before the postulated Chinese contacts. Cot- ton and other woven fibers have a long history in Peru and perhaps Chile, the radiocarbon date of excavated cordage be- ing 6,170 + 295 years B.P. (Bird 1979:14). Double-headed animals of several species adorn Peruvian (Huaca Prieta) cot- ton textiles, but "perhaps more significant as a suggestion of continuity," writes Bird (1963:31-32), "is the recurrence of the double-headed snake theme," especially because "textiles were the major medium used for artistic expression . . . from the beginning of the occupation of the site. The complex tech- niques appear in the earliest levels [radiocarbon-dated to 2400- 2125 B.C.] and were already fully developed." Thus, the Huaca Prieta textiles are at least 825 years if not more than a full millennium earlier than the epigraphically and archaeolog- ically verifiable era of florescence and "stability" of the over- lapping, warring Shang and Chou dynasties of China (ca. 1300 B.C. [see Chang 1980:350-53]), not to mention speculations as to their ability to export complex traits of ritual art to North America. It is certain, on the other hand, that the art of North China was itself influenced by Siberian-type nomadic societies from Mongolia, but exactly when we do not know. The simple painted motifs on pottery of the Neolithic, agricultural Yang- shao culture of Kansu, of the 5th millennium, include double- headed fish and a human face flanked by two fish (Chang 1977: figs. 38, 48). I have searched in vain for motifs of double- headed tiger and double-headed serpent, but an important idol and a large pot of that culture do attest to a cult of the latter animal (Andersson 1943:240 and pl. 187; Hentze 1965; Mund- kur 1983: fig. 39a). Shang oracle-bone inscriptions allude not only to foreigners from "dragon-land" and their annual dragon cult festivities, but also to "double-serpent"-perhaps a local Chinese agricultural deity, for he is queried as to whether he can be persuaded to send rain if propitiatory dances and a ritual immolation of pigs and sheep are staged in his honor (Chang 1970:115, 206-7). Such traditions may have had a long history, for even early Shang kings seem to have wielded priestly power broadly characterizable as shamanistic consid- erably before the mid-2d millennium B.C. (Chang 1983:44-48). However, there is no clear evidence of Siberian forms of shamanism in North China until the incursions, towards the end of that millennium, of the Ch'u, originally a northwestern Mongolian steppe folk. Were these "the people with split tongues and double heads" mentioned in the Shan-hai ching? Their religion, with its prominent serpent, stag or stag antler, and bear symbols (Major 1978:23 7), is of interest because in the Ordos region of Inner Mongolia are found an abundance of bronze, and some stone, figurines-including paired and dou- ble-headed animals-"closely recalling the type of Siberian bronzes found frequently in the Minoussinsk area" (Andersson 1933:143). Tungusic and other Siberian shamans, such as the Chinese wu and hsi (female and male shamans) described by Waley (1955:9, 10, 18 n. 1), differ little in salient characteristics from the Eskimo angakok, the Ojibwa wabeno, and their innumer- able equivalents among the aborigines of both the Americas. Are not such enduring facets of primitive religious life as shamanism and its elementary artistic biases more reliable as criteria for cross-cultural comparisons than the merely superficial similarities of complex designs in art that propo- nents of trans-Pacific Chinese voyages regard as decisive? In countless artistic variations, what is most relevant from our viewpoint is pairing of the kind that connotes either a duality of the spirits of folk religion or a concept of monism/ dualism. Paired animal heads and animal/human heads appear to have constituted the simpler, early models. Masks repre- senting animals constitute an extraordinary category, for they occur worldwide in contexts beyond our surveillance. Fully independent but paired individuals (or their symbols) in ornate decorative art-such as addorsed animals and bodies joined by a common "split and flayed" head-seem to have been derived from those numinous models. The intergrades resist classifica- tion and often aggravate the problems of recognizing an elementary, unifying theme. On a higher philosophical plane, in civilized pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, the Aztec deities Ometeotl and Coatlicue expressed monism/dualism in tradi- tions which Leon-Portilla (1963:52-53, 98) and Fernaindez (1950) have analyzed at length. Contemporary Mexican folk art still reflects the ancient belief in the spiritual dualism of man and animal and their transformations inter se. Cordry (1980:150-254) illustrates the great variety of zoomorphic- anthropomorphic masks that shamans once wore (as Chris- tianized aborigines sometimes still do) during the Lord of the Animals dance or other ceremonies named after one species or another. That ophidian symbols-and cervine ones that explain their migration across Beringia-have commanded focal attention here is hardly fortuitous, for they surface impressively in re- ligious lore almost everywhere, sometimes even alongside the extinct mammoth. In Siberia, according to Anisimov (1963:165-67, n. 18-2 1), the Evenki fantasize a set of gigantic creatures-an elk or deer, kalir, seen as functionally analogous to an antlered mammoth called sheli-and pair the latter with a serpent, dyabdar. This association in creation/cosmic myths, he remarks, "is characteristic of most of the nationalities of northern Asia, and truly, may be considered a common Sibe- rian phenomenon." One wonders whether this mythical associ- ation was presaged long ago in a relic from Mal'ta, one of the Upper Palaeolithic settlements near Lake Baikal whose begin- nings have been radiocarbon-dated to 20,000-21, 000 years ago (Okladnikov and Pospelova 1982:712). Its exact age is uncer- tain, but the engravings on this relic-a mammoth's tooth bored for suspension as an amulet-portray serpents on one side and, on the reverse, swirling punctulations that suggest either coiled reptiles or a cosmic symbolism through seemingly astral bodies or both (Abramova 1967: pl. L2). The ecological and psychological foundations of animal sym- bols and their mystic, numerological9 connotations are not al- ways obvious. The symbolism of the serpent is often ambiva- lent, but it is chiefly a terrifying one-of the mortuary, the underworld, thunder, lightning, water or torrential rains, and also frequently the numbers two and four, which may be equated with the cardinal directions, i.e., endlessly open, wild country. Numerological associations like these are evident not only in ancient and contemporary Siberia (Mundkur 1983: figs. 40c, 54a) but also in China; in Chang's (1983:66-67) words, the "standard equipment" of each of the four agents of the cardinal directions-personages pictured in the ancient "book for sha- mans," the Shan-hai ching-was a pair of dragons and/or ser- ' See also Marshack's (1979) readings of Upper Palaeolithic motifs that occur in groups of two, three, and four.

Four is a magic number among the Eskimo, and "nearly all their umiaks . . . have a picture of [the palraiyuk] drawn along the entire length on each side of the boat" (Nelson 1899:291, 315, 445). The Chaacs and Tlalocs of Mesoamerica, deities assigned to the four celestial corners, were ophidian, and the most celebrated calendrical cuauhxicalli-an enor- mous stone disc of the Aztecs-represents the head of the sun god Tonatiuh (or the earth god Tlaltecuhtli?) conjointly with those of a pair of semicircular serpents engraved along its pe- riphery and also four bifid tongue motifs at the cardinal points (Beyer 1965:134, 149, 156; Navarrete and Heyden 1974). Throughout the Americas aboriginal mythologies and art abound in numerological biases involving animals. The Mapuche (or Araucano) of southern Chile have a flood and creation myth featuring a pair of gigantic serpents as central characters. More remarkable, however, is the fact that the cosmological symbols on the drums of Mapuche and Siberian shamans correspond in several respects (Boning 1978:838-40; Grebe 1973:24-28; Mundkur 1983:275-76, n. 66). Shadowy though they may seem, the roots of bicephalous art lie in the appeal of a few species selected as "assistants" to the shaman and as partners in the man-to-animal or animal-to- animal transformations that characterize the tribal world of dualistic spirits. The Eskimo belief in inua, the Chipewyan Indian notion of manido, and the Mexican nahualli express basically the same attitudes towards animals as the ancient northwestern European elk-human or cervine-ophidian sym- bols mentioned above. Aboriginal zoomorphic art of northern Eurasia and the New World, as I have tried to show, need not exhibit visually striking resemblances, but it does reflect the primordial religious attitudes in subtly unifying ways that merit further, broadly based attention in cross-cultural eth- noarchaeology. Comments by H.-G. BANDI Scharnachtalstr. 12, CH 3006 Bern, Switzerland. 4 IV 84 It is difficult and presumptuous to comment on a paper as extensive and based on as intensive a study of various geo- graphical areas and chronological periods as Mundkur's inter- esting and stimulating work. The scholar who has not exam- ined the general problem in much the same way as the author must limit himself to certain details. One such detail that preoccupies me is whether the "double-headed zoomorphic im- ages" known from "shamanistic traditions of diverse ethnic groups in circumpolar and subcircumpolar Siberia" were "car- ried to northwestern North America during the trans- Beringian migrations of antiquity." Apart from the question, discussed by Mundkur, whether a motif rooted at least partly in the religious imagination can appear independently in differ- ent areas at different times, there is the question whether we have any evidence that influences of this kind from Siberia to northwestern North America date to the end of the glacial period (if I interpret the mention of the "Beringian migrations of antiquity" correctly). As far as the reference to prehistoric Eskimo art, especially that of the Ipiutak culture, is concerned, I doubt that Mundkur's decisive rejection of links to China or South Asia (though it concerns particularly the palraiyuk motif) is justified. Collins (1971) and I have both pointed to the fact that-in addition to influences of the Scytho-Siberian animal style-there seem to be links between some manifesta- tions of the Chou Dynasty and Ipiutak culture, though the details of such relations are still quite enigmatic. Further, I think that Gjessing's (1944) paper on the circumpolar Stone Age should be taken into consideration. Finally, the caption of figure 23 incorrectly identifies the animal represented as a seal rather than a walrus. by STEPHEN C. JETT Department of Geography, University of California, Davis, Calif. 95616, U.S.A. 29 III 84 Mundkur has gathered a plethora of information relevant to the important question of the relationships between pre- Columbian cultures of northern Eurasia and northern North America. The bicephalous "animal style" is only one of a num- ber of commonalities very widely shared in these regions. Mundkur raises a number of interesting issues worthy of com- ment, but because of the contrast between his demonstrated anti-transoceanic-diffusion orientation (e.g., Mundkur 1978, 1980, 1983) and my own focus on the possibilities for transoce- anic influences (e.g., Jett 1968, 1970, 1971, 1983), I can best concentrate on that issue. Mundkur seems to view the "animal style" and its bicephal- ous manifestations as derivative in Eurasia, in very early times, from hunters' beliefs about the animals so important in their lives-beliefs that entered America from Siberia with migrants some 25,000-10,000 B.P., spread southward as far as South America, and manifested themselves in the various local art styles which emerged. He views these manifestations as having begun too early (at least by the 3d millennium B.C.) for postulated transoceanic influences to have been relevant. My comments are both methodological and factual. Mund- kur writes, "Are not the enduring facets of primitive religious life such as shamanism and its elementary artistic biases more reliable as criteria for cross-cultural comparisons than the merely superficial similarities of complex designs in art that proponents of trans-Pacific Chinese voyages regard as deci- sive?" Here we must distinguish between the cultural impor- tance of a trait or complex (e.g., shamanistic beliefs) and the usefulness of a trait or complex in evidencing diffusion (e.g., stylistic similarities). On the whole, the more general, impor- tant, or basic - a trait is, the less useful it is as evidence of diffusion (though it may have diffused), because it may plaus- ibly have been elicited by innate qualities of the human psyche or by similar environmental parameters, subsistence types, or social structures of the groups involved (e.g., Schneider 1977). Traits most useful for demonstrating probable diffusion are typically "superficial," of minor importance, and arbitrary in nature and so not called for by psyche, environment, economy, or social structure (Jett 1971:31-38; Fraser 1965:455-57). In this light, art styles as well as the more arbitrary iconographies often are quite useful indicators. Mundkur shies from consideration of diffusion across great oceanic distances. However, he cites putatively related bicephalous manifestations in Mesoamerica and South America deriving ultimately, by land routes, from Eurasia and arising from widely diffused shamanistic beliefs. In recon- structing this proposed spread, Mundkur leaves great gaps in the intermontane western United States, northern Mexico, and lower Central America. (The last could be at least partially filled [Emmerich 1965:103-5, 166, pl. 3; Benson 1981:150, 154-55, 161, 193, 223, 225, 227].) In fact, the ophidian ele- ments in Southwestern and Plains/Southeastern iconography seem clearly to be primarily of southern (Mexican), not north- ern, origin. With respect to the "Chinese connection," most commen- tators have indeed stressed supposed influences in later, dynas- tic times. However, as Mundkur knows, Tolstoy (1963, 1966, 1972, 1974) and I (Jett 1978:602-5, 639-40; 1983:346-49, 527) have considered the possibility of much earlier, Neolithic trans-Pacific migrations from what is now Southeast China to Middle America. This would have involved Lungshanoid peo- ples rather than the Yang-shao folk of the north (Chang 1977) of whom Mundkur writes. We don't know to what extent Southeast China in these times may have shared dualistic con- cepts of man-animal and animal-animal alter egos (as was later the case), and I know of no bicephalous (or other) images there. 474 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="25">Mundkur: THE BICEPHALOUS "ANIMAL STYLE" However, the time period (mid-4th millennium B.C.) is early enough to meet Mundkur's temporal objections for Middle and South America. I have hypothesized (1983:382) that by the end of the [New World] Colonial Formative (about 1450 B.C.), village farming life, well-developed ceramics, bark-cloth manufacture, color-directional symbolism, religious emphasis on felines and ser- pents, nagualism, and a number of other trait complexes had been introduced to southern Mesoamerica, probably largely from the Yangtze River area of Neolithic coastal China, via the North Pacific current. Return voyages were made, introducing the peanut [see Chang 1973:527] to China. (The people of what is now Southeast China were, at the time under consideration, probably proto-Miao-Yao-speaking rather than Chinese.) Naturally, this hypothesis needs a great deal more investigation. In sum, I view the New World picture as probably more complicated than Mundkur sees it. I believe he is likely correct to the extent that he postulates a significant degree of unity between the cultures of northern Eurasia and interior northern North America and the introduction of bicephalous and other representations via Beringia in late Pleistocene times. How- ever, I think that the totality of evidence suggests the further possibilities that (1) Northwest Coast culture (along with, ulti- mately, its influence on Alaskan Eskimos) is largely of overseas origin, specifically East/Southeast Asiatic of the mid-lst mil- lennium B.C.; (2) Colonial Formative culture in Middle and northern South America is also primarily of East/Southeast Asian origin, beginning in the mid-4th millennium B.C.; (3) Theocratic Formative cultures in Nuclear America (Olmec, Chavin) had additional transoceanic inputs, among them some from early dynastic China about 1100 B.C.; and (4) later epi- sodes of Chinese influence less relevant to the issues in question also occurred (Jett 1983). Each of these periods of contact could have added to and reinforced inputs from earlier times. Diffusion would, thus, have been, in chronological order, east- ward via Beringia, eastward via the Pacific, and northward and southward from Middle and northern South America. by GEORGE KUBLER Department of the History of Art, Yale University, Box 2009, 56 High St., New Haven, Conn. 06529, U.S.A. 27 II 84 In a one-dimensioned linear diffusional study, Mundkur calls attention to one trait. Double-headed animals in Eurasian and Amerindian analogues are studied from after 7000 B.C. into the century preceding ours. He concludes that bicephalous art "corresponds" to the "tribal world of dualistic spirits" by reflecting "primordial religious attitudes." Isomorphy should precede diffusional studies of art (Kubler 1981). Isomorphisms are defined as structural similarities in the spread of different phenomena (Brown 1981:48; Binford 1971:17-18). My position is like Mukarowsky's (1976): (1) the work of art is self-referential and serves as a signifier; (2) the perceiver's time conditions its reading. By this analysis, the work of art is related to other activities, but we know only those of recent times and as recorded by alien observers. Any similarities must be rigorously tested by assuming that they are only disguises for deeper difference. In addition, the method of identifying successive reinterpretations of a similar form leads to recognition of diffusional mirages. These require study by morphological (i.e., formalist) and semiotic (i.e., significant) approaches. Mundkur's contribution to our knowledge of early Eurasian- Amerindian similarities connects visual works with religious attitudes, but the question of what was to be communicated at any time in these nine millennia will remain without an answer until the mirages become part of the model. by WILLIAM BREEN MURRAY Universidad de Monterrey, Apdo. 4442, Succ. H, Monte- rrey, N.L., Mexico. 12 iII 84 Mundkur's study is very interesting, and his wealth of ethnoar- chaeological data is testimony to his long and dedicated work on an inherently difficult problem. Along with many inves- tigators of primitive symbology, however, he has come up against some thorny questions in "archaeo-logic," discovered gaps in the available data that can only be filled by guesswork and subjective leaps of faith, and adopted a theoretical orienta- tion that does not sustain the weight of his argument. First, there are terminological problems. Mundkur uses the term "style" to refer to what is essentially a single motif (a theme or dominant feature). Moreover, this motif is described as "bicephalous animals" when in fact many other kinds of binary imagery are discussed and illustrated, ranging from man-animal pairs to simple forked sticks. "Paired two-ness" might be a more accurate characterization of the trait he is trying to identify, a point which becomes apparent only toward the end of his discussion when the question of the origins of dualism in primitive art is reached. These misdirections com- plicate further the problem of establishing just what is "analo- gous." Mundkur himself admits that the artifacts he describes do not look alike, served many different cultural functions, and come from widely different spatiotemporal contexts. Their only linking feature seems to be binomialism, which is quite probably (as Mundkur-and Levi-Strauss-recognize) a univ- ersal human perception rather than a feature of specific cul- tures. While Mundkur denies that he is talking about Jungian archetypes, I think he comes as close to discussing one as any- one I have read, and his attempt to structure the problem as a case of specific diffusion does not completely hide this underly- ing orientation. Does Mundkur really wish to propose that bicephalous animals are found only in northern Eurasia and the Americas? I think a little searching would reveal equally "analogous" examples in the rest of the world too. Mundkur's ambivalence about diffusionism is more perva- sive. In his earlier writings, he was critical of trans-Pacific diffusionist explanations of Mesoamerican artifacts, but in this one he embraces diffusionism wholeheartedly. Unfortunately, he does so by overthrowing the spatial and temporal limita- tions on ethnoarchaeological comparison that most serious pro- ponents of diffusion now accept as necessary and damages his own credibility as a result. While his initial proposition of contacts between Siberia and Alaska at very early dates is fair enough, the proposed relationships between the Sutton Hoo shield boss and the Classic Maya scepter, or Mongolian belt buckles and Peruvian textiles, take us much farther afield- farther, indeed, than even the most fervent diffusionists may care to go. In particular, most archaeologists demand more cautious use of ethnographic analogies between 19th-century tribes and 20,000-year-old artifacts. Appeals to purported reli- gious conservatism do not completely fill these gaps, and in the end, I felt Mundkur's case against diffusion was better than his case for it. The justification for these excursions is that primitive reli- gious beliefs of great antiquity are being revealed. Here I be- lieve that in archaeological terms Mundkur reaches the fine line between what can be recovered from the past by careful documentation and judicious scientific inference and what must remain by definition forever unknowable. Religious sym- bols may be manifested in material objects, but their ultimate meaning is inherently subjective and unrecoverable. Ar- chaeologists must learn to accommodate themselves to these unknowables as best they can or risk converting the past into simply a gigantic projective screen for modern fears and preju- dices, whether they be of snakes or star wars. I can't think of any way to prove that early man abhorred snakes, two-headed Vol. 25 * No. 4 * August-October 1984</page><page sequence="26">or otherwise, and I think that the infant hybrid science of ethnoarchaeology is better served by concentrating first on problems for which proofs can be adduced and tested. Other- wise, bald surmises liberally spiced with "imagination" may be mistaken for proven facts and lure the innocent into the abyss of pseudoscience. by CHARLES R. WICKE Department of History in Art, University of Victoria, Vic- toria, B.C., Canada V8W, 2Y2. 9 III 84 While for the most part in accord with Mundkur's careful and logical explanations, I would caution that these should not be considered as mutually exclusive with those of Badner, Heine- Geldern, Jett, and Shao, which he dismisses along with Gried- er's stimulating theories. The problem of Old World-New World connections is ex- tremely complex. Though little is being done to disentangle it, it remains one of the most fascinating mysteries of human history. How, indeed, did it happen that first agriculture and then civilization arose after millions of years of human exis- tence at much the same moment in Southeast Asia, China, the Near East, and-isolated from them-the Americas? Unfortunately, a political climate of strident nationalism in many Latin American countries has given rise to a new Mon- roe Doctrine that not only denies pre-Columbian Old World influences but promotes among scholars of those nations a self- censorship in which either the problem is ignored or indepen- dent invention is blindly defended. Thus it is no accident that most of those writing about diffusion into the Americas are not Americans. Under these dismal circumstances, Mundkur's significant contribution is a ray of light. His choice of art motifs for investigation is deliberate. Art lends itself to studies of diffusion because of its arbitrariness and complexity. Connections detailed by Mundkur between Siberia and China seem unassailable and bring others to mind. Zigzag snakes flanking a Western Han bronze duck, ca. 100 B.C., are reminiscent of those in his illustration of a Zuni mask (fig. 38), as are those on a bronze bull trophy head. Both pieces come from the cattle-raising Tien of Yiinnan, for whom "in all such compositions snakes were indispensable" (Watson 1974:114-15, figs. 177, 204). Relationships Mundkur delineates between eastern Siberia and northwestern North America appear just as secure. Lin- guistic studies indicate an Athabaskan migration from the lat- ter area into the southwestern United States around the 14th century that offers the possibility of earlier such movements. Pochteca traders from Mesoamerica roamed the Southwest in Toltec times (A.D. 900-1200), and archaeological evidence shows seminal contacts by 2000 B.C. (Kelly 1966:100-1), so it is not surprising to find the bicephalous motif in Mesoamerica from the early Olmec until the Aztec at European contact. Mundkur's Aztec illustration seems ill-chosen, however. Figure 43 is not a mask but a human skull that earth deities wore at rear belt. Rather than subtly disclosing ophidian iden- tity, the mandible appears to be a standard Aztec interpreta- tion. All mammalian mandibles have bifid terminations. The jaw condyles are rounded, tips of Aztec serpent tongues are pointed-or perhaps the subtlety escapes me. A more felicitous selection would have been the center of the so-called Aztec Calendar Stone, which exhibits a full face flanked by hands which, at the same time, are profile heads devouring hearts. Although proportions differ, the composition is that of Haida sisiutl "soul catchers" (fig. 32). Of course, what I consider an understandable equivocation does not invalidate Mundkur's arguments. For millennia the Bering Strait link functioned as a draw- bridge rising and falling with the ice ages and their subphases. As noted, it went up the last time 14,000 to 10,000 years ago. However, man could have come into the Americas initially as far back as 70,000 B.C. What did he bring with him other than dog, fire, and spear thrower? What was his intellectual bag- gage? Mundkur has given a well-considered partial answer. Reply by BALAJI MUNDKUR Storrs, Conn., U.S.A. 7 v 84 The pursuit of information on boreal religious art and cult practices has given me greater pleasure than the interpretation of it with a fair degree of verve and confidence. I welcome the ideas in the comments but am disappointed that important aspects of human emotion, social history, and ecology-upon which rest problems of the migration of symbols-have not evoked the attention they deserve. About this, I will say more later on. First, I quite agree with Murray that my earlier case against diffusion was tighter than my present casefor diffusion. This is but a reflection of the nature of the data, which made refuta- tion of hypotheses of transoceanic flow of Indic religious sym- bols to Mesoamerica (during the early pre-Christian centuries to the mid-2d millennium A.D.), far easier than making sense out of prehistoric circumpolar ethnoarchaeology. I have at- tempted to do this in an unprecedented way. Murray says that my "ambivalence" about diffusionism is "pervasive." Scholars, however, ought not to be divided into "diffusionist" and "antidiffusionist" factions that are expected to be perpetually faithful to an ideological badge, though some among us may prefer to wear a single one ardently. The human migrations and societal interactions of remote prehistory are factual, but always at issue is the credibility, or reasonable- ness, of reconstructions of epoch-making events that led to culture flow between particular regions. Of course, bicephalous effigies of animals and even abstract, representationally unrelated motifs occur in regions that are quite irrelevant to our discussion. An example of this are the small, Y-shaped wooden ritual objects (some of which are highly abstract but signify an animal such as the hyena or the elephant) used by the Dogon of Mali in their cult of ances- tors and of fertility (Griaule 1963: figs. 131 a, d, and 261 and also the more remarkable specimens, not illustrated, nos. 31.76.1920 and 06.30.34 that I have seen at the Musee de l'Homme, Paris). These ritual objects cannot fail to be com- pared with Eurasian shamans' wands or drumsticks such as those in my figures 14 and 48. "Parallels" though they may be, they are hardly sufficient or more convincing as data for sus- pecting links between Northwest Africa and northern Eurasia than are similarities between stone bark beaters (or bark-cloth- making procedures) for suspecting culture diffusion between the Celebes and Mexico. Innumerable visual "parallels" such as these surely exist elsewhere, but they reflect nothing that is relatable to our specific theme of prehistoric human move- ments and religious symbols in the circumpolar regions. Mur- ray's question whether I "really wish to propose that bicephal- ous animals are found only in northern Eurasia and the Americas" is quite redundant. In conventional usage, culture diffusion generally signifies influences exerted by a (usually) stronger or technologically more advanced society on a receptive, if not "lesser," culture. Major differences in cultural, and often civilizational, levels are tacitly recognized but sometimes mitigated in hypotheses that envisage an exchange of traits. For instance, Jett's very questionable surmise that pre-Columbian Mexican art and ar- chitecture bear evidences of the highly distinctive and complex features of Hindu iconographic symbols is balanced by his mistaken assertion that cobs of maize (a species that was ex- alted in pre-Columbian religions) are sculpted on the facades 476 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="27">Mundkur: THE BICEPHALOUS "ANIMAL STYLE' of the Belur temple, ca. A.D. 1117, in South India (Mundkur 1980). In addition, proponents of culture diffusion have alleged that rather detailed correspondences exist between the (surely mutually esoteric and incompatible) Hindu and Maya/Aztec religious symbols in cultural possessions as important as their ritual calendars. How can Jett reconcile these claims with his contradictory comment that "traits most useful for demonstrat- ing probable diffusion are typically 'superficial,' of minor im- portance, and arbitrary in nature and so not called for by psyche, environment, economy, or social structure" and that "on the whole, the more general, important, or basic a trait is, the less useful it is as evidence of diffusion (though it may have diffused), because it may plausibly have been elicited by innate qualities of the human psyche or by similar environmental parameters, subsistence types, or social structures of the groups involved"? Vaguely guarded disclaimers and qualifiers such as these neither advance Jett's (South Asia-Mesoamerica) diffusionist cause nor affect my present theme in any concrete way. The term "diffusion," as employed conventionally in con- texts like those just illustrated, is totally inapt-at least with respect to the criteria that I depend upon-when we consider the interactions of Stone Age (or virtually Stone Age) hunting societies notable for their uniformly low levels of technology and simplicity of religious thought. Unfortunately, there is no ethnoarchaeologically acceptable alternative word for the mechanism responsible for the geographically wide prevalence of a "style" in primitive art and the seemingly common element in its variations. Rooted as both are in primitive animal cults, neither style nor variations are likely to have been seen by early practitioners of the "animal style" as appealing commodities, economically or intellectually, in quite the same way as peoples of the post-Christian centuries might have viewed each other's differences during their "diffusional," give-and-take encoun- ters. Now, there is such a thing in Eurasia as the "animal style," and though at first glance many relatively recent members of this group may seem to be distant in appearance from their easily identifiable forebears, the latter are ultimately referable to the religious concept of animals as alter egos, whether of the hunter, shaman, or high deity. The bicephalous animal-human forms are the most obvious among the immense range of art- istic variants and, visually, constitute the reference point. Thus, Murray's reservations notwithstanding, I have no com- punction about adhering to "bicephalous" rather than switch- ing to less pregnant terms such as "binomialism." The Sutton Hoo dragon, the Chinese t'ao-t'ieh, the Mongolian belt buck- les, and the Peruvian "Staff God" were given merely as ran- dom examples. Except for a tenuous common base in prehis- toric art, no specific genetic relationships or linear descent were implied with respect to any of the specimens and ethnic groups. Admittedly, the words "diffusion" and "style" lack clarity, but this is unavoidable in our contexts, since I bridge extremely wide geographic and temporal gaps. I have, there- fore, refrained from using the word "homologues," which im- plies provable genetic connections. To stress the multiplicity of variants of the "animal style" and their generally obscure but recognizably common features, I have preferred the genetically noncommittal word "analogues" to "parallels," the trite favor- ite in postulations of transoceanic culture diffusion in which excessive importance is given-often idiosyncratically-to closeness of visual resemblances in art ("striking parallels") and little or none to other criteria. Except that I question the merit of comparisons made in this manner, there is of course no real distinction between "analogues" and "parallels," and indeed I have used the latter word sparingly. In sum, what appears to have "diffused" is the predilection for substyles of the bicephalous motif, as though an ancestral superstition about transformability had been carried far and wide along with other durable traits such as those mentioned by Gurvich (1979). The idea of transformation, inter se, of humans, animals, gods, goddesses, and demonical beings is, of course, not the monopoly of any one particular ethnic group or continent. My point was that there are reasonable grounds for exploring common features in the art and myths of northern Eurasians, the broad event of whose terrestrial spread- "diffusion" in the simple lexical sense-from Siberia to Alaska and southward is undisputed. Thus the only alternative to my viewpoint about the diffu- sion of the animal style is resort to psychoanalytical theorizing, which I detest. Murray thinks that my argument is virtually indistinguishable from Jung's notion of "archetypes." He is quite wrong. I wonder whether he has referred to my argument against Jung and my fairly lengthy treatments (in chaps. 5 and 6, especially pp. 262-73, of Mundkur 1983) on experimental psychobiology versus the inanity of psychoanalyzing the com- plexities of human emotion manifest in dreams, myths, social behaviors, and artistic symbols involving animals, chiefly the serpent. That early man abhorred this animal is hard to estab- lish, and, indeed, I have not offered any information as "proof." There are cogent reasons in my book, however, for concluding that the factors that ensure the serpent a unique place in human social history differ sharply from the economic factors that impel veneration of animals such as cervids and bovids. A goodly segment of cultural anthropological data consists of material objects that reflect human emotion in one way or another. The emotion of elementary fear (which subsumes anx- iety and stress and is distinguishable from socially conditioned apprehension) is distinct from all emotions (except anger) in that it has basic neurophysiological, i.e., psychobiological, de- terminants that are especially noteworthy in the higher subhu- man primates and man. In conjunction with ecological forces, these complex determinants, as I explain in my book, have always exercised a greater influence on an individual's biolog- ical and social behavior (and, by extension, on entire human societies), through dreams and hierophants, for example, than is generally realized. The choice of certain animal species as cult objects, whether out of fear or for socially inspired rea- sons, deserves serious interdisciplinary attention. Cultural an- thropologists do themselves a disservice by neglecting this approach. Our knowledge of circumpolar hunting societies, shamanism, and the peopling of the Americas via Siberia places us on far firmer ground when we view the elementary motifs in primitive art and myth as incidental, readily diffus- ible societal characteristics rooted in many peculiarly regional causes rather than as the products of an emotion explicable by the vagaries of Jungian psychoanalysis of "archetypes" or structural anthropological theory. Murray questions my "appeals to purported religious conser- vatism." The symbol maker's repertoire is, of course, in- fluenced by whim and molded by environment and time, and I have twice said so. Ancient mythic and artistic symbols are, nevertheless, often thematically decipherable even in modern religious lore. The ultimate meanings of symbols may to a certain extent be inherently subjective and unrecoverable, but surely not so absolutely as Murray seems to think. Modern scholars, fortunately, are not inhibited on this account and, indeed, strive for approximate reconstructions of prehistoric events despite the methodological constraints normal to an- thropology, ethnoarchaeology, and religious symbolology. The accurate, quantitative methodologies of the physical and biological sciences form the bases of physical anthropology, and they are now increasingly valued in archaeology. Murray may have intended his concluding remark about ethnoarchaeol- ogy and pseudoscience to be an edifying one, but cultural anthropologists and semiologists (whose subject matter con- demns them to labor on as "pseudoscientists") are likely to Vol. 25 * No. 4 * August-October 1984 477</page><page sequence="28">disagree. I hope it will not dampen inquiry into primitive man's "intellectual baggage," to use Wicke's term. I need not comment on existing theories of culture diffusion to the New World except briefly on a point or two: Bandi calls attention to what may turn out to be very interesting details of Chinese (Chou)-Ipiutak "relations," but, as he admits, these are still quite enigmatic. Even if these be factual, their fairly recent manifestations affect our theme of origins little or not at all. Jett, on the other hand, says that the picture within the New World is "probably more complicated than Mundkur sees it," though I did not at all postulate any schemes of migratory movements. By contrast, the cultural groups involved in con- ventional hypotheses of culture diffusion include the Chinese (whether Lungshanoid or northern), Southeast Asians, Mesopotamians, dynastic Egyptians, Carthaginians, Canaan- ites, Phoenicians, Romans, Etruscans, and perhaps others in bizarre patterns of transoceanic movements to the New World that are far more complicated than I have had occasion to contemplate with respect to trans-Beringian movements. I, for one, consider both the "evidence" and the argument heard so far for transoceanic culture diffusion to be extravagant and therefore remain as sceptical as before. Apropos Wicke's observation about figure 43, I do state in the text that it represents a death mask or human skull. His point about Aztec depictions of the mandibles of skulls, how- ever, is a good one, for it underscores my statement that works of art are apt to impel varied interpretations simply because they impress different observers in different ways. Often these interpretations can be moot. Wicke is right: Superficially, man- dibular condyles do create the impression of a serpent's bifid tongue; but their stylization is by no means so "standard" as it may seem. In a skull-headed statue of the chthonic god Xolotl the mandibular ends are deeply cleft, while in a well-known rock-crystal skull they are prominently wide, plane-edged, and uncleft (Alcina Franch 1983: figs. 308, 314) and in still other examples not emphasized at all. The tips of serpents' tongues in Aztec art are not necessarily pointed, though they usually are, especially in the codices. The exceptions in sculpture are many. The tips of a bifid tongue may be coiled or crosier-like and rounded, and, occasionally, the whole tongue is rectangu- lar and boxlike (Beyer 1965: figs. 41, 249, 250). In the or- namentation of facades, it may even be depicted as an isolated motif split into left and right halves with serrated, squared, or chamfered ends. Thus, in an ophiolatrous culture whose art abounds in inventive representations of the serpent and its few overt morphological traits, there is no compelling reason for a literal interpretation of the mandibular ends as mere condyles and nothing more. What is important is the associations, for Coatlicue's ophidian, chthonian, and dualistic qualities are be- yond dispute. The so-called Metro Coatlicue (from which the detail in figure 43 is taken) has left and right feet in the form of rattlesnakes' heads. The better-known colossal statue of Coat- licue (Fernandez 1959) has not only double rattlesnake heads but also a pair of serpent heads that emerge beneath the man- dible of the skull attached to her belt. Even Coyolxauhqui, her daughter, has a double-headed coral snake symbol and a skull attached to her belt. It is associations such as these which subtly smack of ophidian symbolism as far as figure 43 is con- cerned. Kubler, giving his own ideas along with a reference to Brown's (on innovational diffusion), introduces the subject of isomorphy. This is an important facet but, at least at this juncture, does not strike me as crucial. Brown's (1981:17-27, fig. 2.3) mathematical models reflect complex factors such as entrepreneurial skills and social communication networks vis- a-vis modern agricultural and industrial econometrics. He proposes a six-point framework for studying the geographical spread of innovations during the 20th century that may be useful in the contexts he has outlined, but the extent of its applicability, if not relevance, to the ethnoarchaeology of aboriginal cultures (especially those long since defunct) is quite another matter. This is not to deny the merits of a search for isomorphic traits. Indeed, I express tacit agreement here and elsewhere in statements that artistic criteria, considered in iso- lation, are prone to subjective interpretations unless they are evaluated alongside data from diverse subdisciplines of the "exact" sciences, sociology, and the humanities. The informa- tion now available, however, is often difficult to accommodate in syncretic works; at least, it has not been suffiiently explored cross-culturally in this way. A full-fledged treatment of isomorphisms is bound to remain an ideal for a long time. It demands a book-and a hypothetical, perhaps very specula- tive, model-rather than an article that merely points out the probable significances of a few examples of a particular type of cultic art and recommends enlarging the inquiry from a broad viewpoint. Furthermore, it demands interdisciplinary collab- oration between area specialists whose main objectives, usu- ally, are very far apart. I agree on the two points Kubler ascribes to Mukarowsky. They apply not only to works of art but also to the interpretation of mythological symbols and a very wide range of phenomena that are evaluated primarily, and often predominantly, on the basis of visual or other per- sonal impressions. Though I draw on currently favored ideas about human migrations to the New World, I must stress that I offer no formal hypothesis of culture diffusion (in the conven- tional sense, as explained above) but call attention only to certain seemingly conservative socio-religious facets of art that express the human sensitivity to animals. I must repeat that this sensitivity is apparent to an extraordinary degree only with respect to a very few species that figure in cult worldwide (and in special ways in our contexts) and is primordial only in the sense that it has ecological and psychobiological foundations in primate evolution and behavior insofar as they have affected human societal evolution itself. I see little merit in refraining from giving serious thought to selected forms of religious art, with constant reference to their foundations and their possible relationships in prehistory. Isomorphism-inevitably idiosyn- cratically-subsumes the recognition of similarities that may or may not be substantial. Despite this, they are just as idiosyncratically prone to be admitted to, or excluded from, structural schemes. I have pursued new and seemingly useful directions but also been temerarious enough to tackle a difficult part of the ar- chaeological record. Thus I can sympathize with two different outlooks: According to Daniel (1984:352), "Gordon Willey has said recently that one cannot practise as an archaeologist un- less one is an optimist. I am a practising archaeological pessim- ist: enjoying the record but not hopeful that many parts of it can or will be decoded.... We say that we are testing out the past by using ethnographical and historical models: well and good, but we must not forget that in so doing we are not decoding but inventing the past." Kubler would like to see isomorphic congruencies and a model before entertaining prob- lems in the diffusion of art. How, in the first place, can one construct a model unless comparativists bring grist to the mill? References Cited ABRAMOVA, Z. A. 1967. Palaeolothic art in the U.S.S.R.
