At the same time, the manner in which these concepts are metaphorically expressed through other Vao concepts and thus permeate much of life on Vao will be described. This analysis will give a definite degree of orderliness to the data. Although this orderliness may be implicit in the system, it is not an explicit feature of much of the observed data. Any conceptual delineation of Vao native terms is bound to be provisional in nature. That is, although each inductive generalization made in the following pages is backed up by a number of ethnographic statements, the use and availability of more such statements would undoubtedly change these delineations and generalizations. They would serve to give a more exact conceptual delineation by mentioning uses of a native term in contexts that had not been previously given, or by mentioning contextual uses that are counter to an aspect of the induced delineation. In any language, however, there is a residual vagueness that would not be removed by the adduction of further statements. Wittgenstein discovered family-resemblant concepts (1953, passim), and these appear to be characteristic of all natural languages (Needham 1975:367). Thus, while precision is not being looked for where it is not, precision is still necessary in the working out of the analysis in order to clarify where the vagueness occurs and in what ways it is manifest. To gain a realistic picture of another language's categories, it is necessary to display the language's obscurities as well as its highlights (N. J. Allen 1976:550). Inevitably, any study of Vao must rely heavily on the one major monograph about it ? Stone Men of Malekula (1942). Although this contains a very large amount of information about Vao, it is obviously incomplete, since Layard spent only *This text is part of my B.Litt. thesis, "Issues in the Analysis of the Ethnography of the New Hebrides," written in 1978 under the supervision of Professor Rodney Needham (to whom I am most grateful), Institute of Social Anthropology, University of Oxford. The Social Science Research Council of Great Britain funded this work. Vao is one of the Small Islands off the northeastern coast of Malekula in the archipelago of the New Hebrides, which were renamed Vanuatu in 1980. It would only be fair to add that nothing of what is said here in a critical vein can affect the main part of Layard's achievement. The bulk of his monograph is ethnographic detail, and without the richness and quality of these data the present article could never have been written. (Opposite). Vao slit gong (na-mbe) orchestra.

So the following analysis is characterized by provisionality and, at times, a paucity of material. In this sense, it is very different from Layard's. While admitting a lack of knowledge in certain areas, Layard regards many of his interpretations as "conclusive" (e.g., 231 )1 and in other cases offers "ample proof" (e.g., 255). But certainty is unobtainable in social anthropology when dealing with ethnographic investigations. The quality of such an investigation is relative to the amount of information available. From this information, some kind of concrete logic is often induced, and this serves as an explanatory model guiding the reader through the ethnography. However, any postulation of a concrete logic is precisely that, an assumption or working hypothesis that will be modified, or not, according to the factual material available. The incompleteness of Layard's glossary2 is evident from its lack of examples of Vao terms describing emotional states. Similarly, he did not record the native term for fire. These omissions may be, of course, a reflection of the natives' interests, rather than of Layard's. However, even if the glossary is only apparently incomplete, this still has an important consequence. Layard uses terms such as "consecrated" in the text of his monograph without giving the Vao term for this. Rather than follow him in the making of such implicit inferences, phrases such as "become prohibited to women through the sacrifice of a tusked boar to it" will be used instead. In this way, the following account will, it is hoped, remain closer to the Vao concepts involved, and with any luck, exegetical elegance will not be sacrificed as a consequence. It is, however, necessary to use certain basic English terms whose Vao equivalents are not given; otherwise, the following analysis would have to be in the language of Vao itself, not in English. Such terms, however, will be as explicit as possible whenever they are used. Some of the conceptual delineation has already been carried out by Layard, e.g., his analytical summary of the 1.

There is a more comprehensive dictionary of the Vao language on Vao itself. It was compiled by Rev. Jamond while he was the resident Marist missionary there (O'Reilly 1951:250). Unfortunately, I have been unable to obtain a copy of this, or even to discover the translation of various words in it. In 1900 a small catechism was published in the language of Vao (O'Reilly 1958), but this has also proved well-nigh impossible to obtain. Neither the Biblioth?que Nationale, Paris, nor any library in the United Kingdom has a copy.</page><page sequence="3">72 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 characteristics of Ta-ghar (217). What will be attempted here is a much more systematic approach to conceptual analysis. It will take into account both the criticisms made in the preceding chapters and Layard's exegetical sections. So the following is not only a rewriting of the facts of Stone Men of Malekula but also a modification of its interpretations so that the resulting conceptual analysis of the Vao language will be more representative of their categories, rather than of ours. Certain delineated categories will not appear to be tightly bounded, and there will be doubt and uncertainty over certain possible interpretations and topics of interest. As Layard himself states, "One and the same story can be told from two different points of view, depending on the angle from which the narrator sets out to tell it" (87). Ta-ghar and ta-mat will be presented as organizing and central concepts respectively. Ta-ghar is the organizing concept of Vao life, since it includes most of the other important concepts within it (217) and thus can be regarded as a conceptual framework within which most, if not all, of the other Vao concepts are articulated. The appellation of "central concept" for ta-mat is justifiable, since the natives state that they lavish so much care on their boars in order that they may sacrifice them in the Maki and that the point of all their dances and rites (including the Maki) is to ensure a place for them in the land of the dead (225). This series of purposes gains its meaning from the transmission of ta-mat from boar to sacrificer in Maki sacrifice, and from Vao to the crater in the Ambrym volcano in the land of the dead. Without this transmission of ta-mat, most Vao actions would be meaningless and pointless with regard to their beliefs about the nature of the world. Ta-ghar This is the most clearly defined and complex character in Vao. He can be summarized as appearing under two aspects: (A) As a mythical hero arriving in a canoe, whence he distributes foodstuffs and pigs together with instructions about how to rear the pigs, and then sails away, taking a woman with him. The islands of Oba, Maewo, and Pentecost are regarded as his home (217). (B) As a deity with the following attributes: (1) Is creator of all men and things. (2) Lives in the moon, where his image may be recognized in the dark areas we call "the man in the moon." (3) Begets all human children by the moon . . . whence, when ready, the children fall into their mothers' wombs, which are the portal through which they come to the light of day. (4) Lights up the moon. (5) Secondarily, and by analogy, as luminary, associated with the sun and to a lesser extent with the stars, and, by yet further analogy, with the clouds and winds. (6) Through his association with the sun makes trees and plants grow; but has no control over the weather. (7) Is definitely not a ghost (ta-mat), though like one in respect of the fact that he has no body. (8) Is the object of no cult or supplication, but is accepted as in all ways good. (217-218) Above all, Ta-ghar is light. In the Small Islands, this "light" is both the light and warmth of day, and the light of esoteric knowledge of a beneficent kind, such as the transmission of information about medicines (634). He is responsible for the creation and maintenance of order in human affairs in three main ways. First, he is a predestinator, deciding how long people will live and when and how they will die. Second, he is a guardian, meting out punishments in this life ? only by depriving the offender of pleasure in it, or by giving him sickness (Layard MS).3 (This is not contradictory to the idea that Ta-ghar is in all ways good, as any punishment that he may mete out is seen as being for the offender's good.) Third, he is the founder of the "straight," or "perfect," system of social organization that once existed but has now been partly destroyed or damaged (217). The light of the moon rules all ritual life and the calendar (layard MS) and is also an important aspect of Ta-ghar. Thus, he also rules all ritual life and the calendar. The passage of time, other than within any one day, is given and reckoned by these ritual events. Le-hev-hev Le-hev-hev is defined in opposition to the cosmol?gica! aspects of Ta-ghar. Like the creator-deity, Le-hev-hev is bodiless. Ta-ghar is in all ways good (218), whereas Le-hev hev is wholly bad, terrible, and inspires fear (225). Ta-ghar is male (217), whereas Le-hev-hev is female on Atchin and sexless on Vao (218). He (Ta-ghar) is associated with, or is, light (217), whereas it (Le-hev-hev) is associated with the dark (Layard MS). He lives above the ground, in the moon (217), whereas it lives below the ground, in the barang na ta-mat, "Cave of the Dead" (227). He creates men (217), whereas it eats them (227). He gave pigs to the people of Vao (256), whereas it takes them away from them by devouring their souls (227). He is sometimes referred to as human (217), whereas it is sometimes referred to as "a monster with two immense shears, like a crab" (Speiser 1913:104). Transitional Categories. Those men who die a violent death, or are slain in battle, and therefore never find a grave are called ta-mat oamp (235, 610), or "fiery ghost." They have no resting place and are always wandering, seeking to injure whomever they can find. They act only at night, flitting through the bush and appearing like a "red will-o'-the-wisp" (631). To prevent or to lessen the chance of being attacked by ta-mat oamp, men carry a torch when walking about at night. That the ta-mat oamp are feared is also indicated during the last initiation hoax, when an 3. This will be used as the reference for all Layard's unpublished manuscripts on Atchin and other material relating to Vao.</page><page sequence="4">McClancy: Vao concepts 73 "unmarried" initiate calls out, within hearing distance of the new initiates, to all ta-mat oamp to come and have homosexual intercourse with the new initiates (519). Even ordinary ta-mat when wandering cause unease to the people of Vao because one is never too sure what they may be up to (Layard MS). Le-hev-hev has agents who keep the ta mat, with low, or no, grade in the caves near Bong-na-un, where the latter go after death (237). Layard states that these agents are all aspects of a "Being" called Hambalev or Ambalev (238). Perhaps significantly, Hambalev is always referred to in the singular (Godefroy 1936:119-120), whereas Ambalev is referred to in the plural (ibid.:128). It seems that these terms are used to refer to the name of a class and the members of that class, a procedure that I shall follow. Hambalev wanders along the bush paths, grabbing men and taking them to Le-hev-hev, who immediately devours them (ibid.:120). As opposed to Ta-ghar and Le-hev-hev, who are never seen, Hambalev is often sighted by the natives (ibid.:119). He is considered the most terrible of ta-mat (ibid.:120). Bwili are flying tricksters who live on the Malekulan mainland between Norsup and Uri, though their activities extend to Vao (Layard 1930:504). After undergoing an initiation rite, which involves the dismemberment of the candidates and the requirement that they laugh throughout the length of the operation, they acquire the ability to fly as fowls and to metamorphose into other creatures and natural objects. Under these guises, they trick their victims (ibid.:506). One of their tricks is to assume the form of a husband or wife and to seduce the unsuspecting spouse, so causing the victim's death (81,239). Bwili are much feared (239). They are members of a class called Chamba Lep, which Layard describes as "a kind of brotherhood." Chamba Lep is the same word as Hambalev (239). So it appears that bw/7/' and the agents of Le-hev-hev may be members of the same class. Nu-una are "spirits" who walk about as humans and can assume the forms and features of a wife or husband. If they seduce the unsuspecting spouse, the latter will die within seven days (Layard MS). Other than the fact that nu-una are "spirits" who can metamorphose into human form, as opposed to bw/7/', who are men with a similar capacity for metamorphosis, the two categories closely resemble one another. People on Vao have a conception of what it is to lead a normal life. They produce and reproduce and pass through a ritual process that ensures them a place in the land of the dead. If their living descendants continue to provide them with sufficient numbers of pigs' ta-mat to devour, the dead never leave the crater of the Ambrym volcano (235), except for their annual return at the time of the arrival of the palolo sea-annelid swarms on the shores of the Small Islands (6, 288). What appears to be common to the above four categories ? ta-mat, Hambalev, bw/7/, and nu-una ? is that they all seem to be transitional between the categories of living men, dead men, and animals. Ta-mat oamp are men who have died but have never reached the land of the dead. Hambalev live in the milieu of the land of the dead and the journey to reach it but have never been alive as men. Bwili are men who can change into animals and back again. Ta mat, in the sense of dead men, live in the Ambrym volcano for most of the time. It is only when they begin to wander that they cause unease. In each of the above examples, the concept lies between two others whose members are normally regarded without fear. But it is an attribute common to the members of these four concepts that they are all greatly feared by the people of Vao. Interestingly, Godefroy quotes a native statement that "wherever the reverend fathers live, Hambalev very rarely comes" (1936:120). It is as though Hambalev and Christian missionaries are recognized by the natives as mutually exclusive classes. Like black and white, they are both members of the same immediately superordinate category and are opposed to one another. Hambalev are feared; missionaries on Vao (as far as is known) are not.

(Haddon Library, Cambridge University, courtesy Cultural Centre, Vanuatu)</page><page sequence="5">74 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 The Vao term for white men in general is "To-hal-hal," "those who float" (i.e., those who travel and live in ships) (764). In a taped conversation with J. C. Kenna, Layard said that the natives on Atchin described the first white men that they saw as arriving in enormous cities that floated on water. They could turn on a tap and get fresh water. They could drink in the middle of the sea. The sailors had hung up their washing on lines. The natives thought that these were the ancestral founders of the Maki flying back. These ancestors were white, whiter than us (we're pink), i.e., they're moon men. But the natives soon realized their mistake. To the natives, a missionary must not have seemed like the vast majority of white men that they had met. Except for the early explorers, the latter were plantation owners or traders, or, in slightly earlier times, blackbirders or sandalwooders (Harrisson 1937; Speiser 1913:107-108). On the other hand, Godefroy, a missionary, stayed with the natives, did not carry a gun, learned their language, did not treat them badly (in a physical sense), and did not live on a boat. And, of course, he was concerned with the saving of men's souls. Given the above, and because of his relation to Hambalev, Godefroy must have been considered transitional between the categories of white men and natives, and between those of living men and ta-mat, in the sense of dead men. It might also be pertinent to add that Layard is now remembered (in 1978) by old men still alive on Vao as having been able to fly and jump over the roofs of houses (B. Pointer, personal communication). In the eyes of the natives, Layard apparently had the same distinctive features as a missionary, with the exceptions that he was not primarily concerned with the saving of men's souls and that he occasionally participated in Vao rituals (Langham 1975:237). Thus, Layard can possibly be seen as a member of a transitional class between those of white men and of natives. It would be a class with only one instance ? himself. Another basic difference between missionaries and Layard on the one hand and white men in general on the other is that there is no record of any missionaries being killed by the natives of Malekula, although a "good many" other white men were killed (Corlette 1939). Layard, of course, lived to tell his tale. Ta-mat Layard translates ta-mat as "soul," "spirit," "ghost," or "dead man," depending on the context in which it is used. Ta-mat crosses English conceptual categories. The term can be used in a classificatory way, as when Hambalev is called a ta mat (Godefroy 1936:120), or as a defining characteristic, as when a dead person is called a ta-mat. Rather than try to obtain a precise English verbal equivalent for the native term (a procedure that has led to much confusion in the understanding of the related Oceanic concept mana [Firth 1940:483]), the native term will be used here. The context in which it is placed should make it clear which particular sense is being used. There is no discussion by Layard or native exegesis about ta-mat in the abstract. Whenever it is mentioned, it is always linked to a concrete situation, e.g., in Maki sacrifice, ta-mat pal, or ta-mat oamp. All ta-mat ultimately emanates from Ta-ghar. Only pigs and men can, and do, possess it (257). Pigs' ta-mat comes from their association with Ta-ghar, who, according to myth, gave pigs to the first men of Vao (256). Men acquire ta-mat from the pigs that they sacrifice in the Maki. Ta-mat is capable of degrees. Through sacrifice both pigs and men accumulate it and thus grades. The sacrifice of a tusked boar permits a transference of the boar's ta-mat to either another pig or a man if the recipient is of lower grade than the boar. So a man will sacrifice a tusked boar of higher grade than himself, thereby acquiring the ta-mat of that boar and its grade (393, 430). Similarly, boars are sacrificed for other boars, so accumulating their ta-mat (258). There appears to be a normal upper limit to the stockpiling of ta-mat, namely, that set by the number of grades themselves. Once one has achieved the highest grade, there is no higher grade to sacrifice for, unless one is lucky enough? in the terms of the people of Vao?to manage to get hold of a human being. Since the accumulation of ta-mat can be seen as a striving for, or aspiration towards, Ta-ghar (732), there is nothing more that one can do when one has achieved the highest grade. One has become like Ta-ghar on earth, in the sense that one has gained the maximum degree of ta-mat possible. One is unworldly, yet still in this world. By having fulfilled one's purpose in life, one now transcends this purpose and its rules, since it has no point till death. Thus, a member of the highest grade, Melteg-aul, meaning "the first in everything and everywhere" (Godefroy 1933:243), a status achieved by very few, can follow his own caprice, because? in a sense very real to the people of Vao?he is outside life: nothing can harm him. This is exactly what does happen; members of this grade disregard at will "even the most absolutely accepted customs" (ibid.:242). They flout "the most time-honored tradition in utter contempt of justice, nor do they hesitate even to steal, and this in full sight and knowledge of the whole tribe" (ibid.:243). They even occasionally eat with women, an otherwise strictly observed male-proscriptive rule (Layard MS). These men are able to employ forces that serve to maintain their unusual position in Vao society. Being so close to the spirit world, thanks to their accumulation of ta-mat, the dead help them in every way, the elements are their servants, and they can perform "the most terrible sorceries" (Speiser 1913:99). The idea of an upper limit to one's ta-mat is also implied in the story of a man "too holy to be incised" (522). The man in question had already achieved a very high grade (probably the highest). Therefore, if incision is in fact regarded as a sacrifice of oneself, the conferring of spiritual power being located in the mutilated part (478), then in his case there would have been no point in the incision. He would not have needed any more power. A similar implication follows from</page><page sequence="6">McClancy: Vao concepts 75 the account of a boar that was of such a high grade that no one could sacrifice it (261). Ta-mat resident in men is in some way superior to the ta mat in pigs. Human sacrifice in order to make a ghamal prohibited to women is considered more desirable than the sacrifice of a tusked boar for the same purpose (622). The former confers favors of the same order as, but still superior to, those conferred by the latter (622). This particular predilection may be due to the fact that the possible upper limit of ta-mat resident in man is greater than that in a pig, for in the series of Maki sacrifices, one acquires the ta-mat and gains the grade of sacrificed pigs. Thus, one accumulates one's ta-mat, finally reaching the limit by sacrificing a boar of the highest grade and adding its ta-mat to the store of ta-mat the sacrificer has been gathering in himself. But this seems an implausible explanation, for a human victim is worth "many times" the value of the finest tusked boar (620). Unfortunately, Layard does not state by what standard he is able to make this statement. If one were concerned solely with the transmission of a large amount of ta-mat, then the sacrifice of a number of boars of different grades equivalent to the number that a man would have to sacrifice in order to achieve a high grade, would have the same effect?in terms of making a ghamal prohibited to women?as a human sacrifice. This is obviously not the case, as is suggested by the above reference and by the fact that whenever a human sacrifice is mentioned, the Maki grade reached by the victim is never stated. This suggests that the relevant fact is, possibly, not the victim's grade (an important consideration in all other rituals involving sacrifice) but that he is human. Thus, human acquisition of ta-mat can be seen as the culminating accession of it. After being acquired by a man, the ta-mat does not "go" anywhere but ultimately becomes that by which the man is defined. It is as though pigs were merely vehicles for the transport of ta-mat, acting as intermediaries between Ta-ghar and men, ta-mat achieving its full "extension" only when resident in either of the two latter categories. There would be no value in enabling it to achieve its full "extension" in pigs, since the latter are merely means to an end. Ta-mat has no importance for pigs themselves, since they have no afterlife. Pigs, as vehicles of ta-mat, need not be alive: it is possible to kill one's "death pig" (233) before one's own death. Thereby, a place in the land of the dead is ensured for a member of the higher grades of the Maki. The pig's ta-mat is presumably stored until its owner's death, at which point it is released and accompanies its owner's ta-mat to the meeting with Le-hev-hev, who devours the pig's ta-mat. It seems to be possible to talk in terms of ta-mat being stored, since the natives think of it as a spiritual substance that is gradually built up by successive Maki sacrifices (Layard 1952:291). This, however, is based on the assumption that there is no point in accumulating something if that thing cannot endure ? otherwise, one would be replenishing an ever-diminishing source continually. Also, if ta-mat did not endure in some way or another, the question could be asked where it goes or what happens to it, and how a person could become a ta-mat after death if his "store" of it was forever dwindling. Interestingly, one plausible, albeit inferred, motive for the cannibal feast that follows human sacrifice is that the victim should lose all identity and with it his "soul" (Speiser 1923:241). This inference tends to corroborate the view that ta-mat is the only aspect of a person that can be used to identify him after death, so that if one loses one's identity (remembering that a human victim is called a ta-mat even before he is sacrificed [451]), one's soul is lost too and vice versa. Ta-mat appears to be linked with prestige and ancestral power. There are no chiefs on Vao, but, in an otherwise democratic organization, there is in each village always one dominant family that also happens to be the wealthiest in pigs (297). This wealth enables them to perform the best individual Maki sacrifices and so to obtain the highest grades (298). Thus, the wealthiest men are also those highest in the Maki and therefore those with the greatest amount of ta-mat. It is a member of the highest grade who "makes the Maki" for the whole "line" of Ma/c/'-men to which his son belongs; he is the "leading man" of the rite (299). This position, although it does not enable the incumbent to exercise authority over the people of his village, does confer considerable prestige. The respect that is shown to such men, and their ability to disregard custom, has been mentioned above. After death the grade, and therefore the amount of a person's ta-mat, determines the amount of influence that he has over his living descendants. The influence of a man of high grade, great during his life, is immensely increased when he dies (536). Descendants feel more able to deal with what we would call some of the vicissitudes of life under the protection of an ancestor who is a member of a high grade than under one who is in a low grade (Speiser 1913:99), for ancestral wrath is a cause of ill fortune (49), and one's ancestors are appealed to for aid in cases of sicknesses (526, 633). The higher the grade of the ancestor the more efficacious his aid will be. Unfortunately, Layard gives no indication of which particular ancestors one appeals to. Although ta-mat live either in the Ambrym volcano or in caves, they can also visit people while the latter are dreaming. In this way, Le-taghar was taught the methods for making wind magic and rain magic (633). Ta-mat who are members of high grades are said to live both in the crater of the Ambrym volcano and in the vicinity of the dolmens and stone platforms used in Ramben and Maki Ru, respectively (12). The natives do not state whether the ta-mat are always at the latter two or just come on occasion. Whether the statement that the ta-mat appear to reside in two places at once is a contradiction or an example of a class of beings whose members can exist simultaneously in more than one place is a question that cannot be answered from the information available. Before attempting to draw together some of the implications of the above evidence, it is necessary to make a</page><page sequence="7">76 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 brief review of Layard's (to my mind highly plausible) interpretation of incision ritual. As stated above, he suggests that incision is a sacrifice of oneself and involves the intake of "psychic power"4 from the ancestors (479). As with the transmission of magical powers (641) and of ta-mat (394, 430), the incision ritual is hedged around with prohibitions (510), the new initiates being secluded in the initiation lodge for 30 days. During this time, the initiate does not wear a penis wrapper, "since the Lodge itself is consecrated and itself wraps him around" (481). From this time on, he will always be seen wearing one (42). Thus the penis wrapper symbolizes the differentiation of the initiates from boys and women. The initiate is no longer "only a woman" (unincised boys are referred to in this way [480]). Following this line of argument, "the penis wrapper may be regarded as a container in which the seat of power is enclosed" (481). Layard's interpretation is further strengthened by the account of the man "too holy to be incised," a situation easily understood if incision is considered as a conferring of power. Thus, the intake of some undifferentiated "spiritual power" appears to be a prerequisite for being in a position to be able to start sacrificing tusked boars and taking grades in the Maki. This "spiritual power" appears to be separate from ta-mat, the source of the former being the ancestors (the ta-mat) and incapable of degrees. One is either incised or one is not. There is no recognized intermediate position. It is the first culturally imposed statement of the differentiation of the sexes, a difference that is to be exaggerated by the Maki, where the sexes eat separately. When discussing a Maki sacrifice, Layard states that ta mat could be covered by the concept mana, the latter being understood as "an invisible source of psychological, spiritual and social power" (1952:290). In this particular case, Layard is discussing the use of the term on Atchin. Since the term has the same extension on both islands, is the same philologically on both, and the meaning of Maki sacrifice is the same on both, it seems a reasonable assumption that Layard would have wished to make the same statement about the meaning of "ta-mat" on Vao as he did for the meaning of "ta-mats" on Atchin. Although this does not imply that "mana" is a translation of the Vao "ta-mat," it does indicate that ta-mat can be characterized in terms of power. Speiser implies substantially the same point when he states that "those who do not sacrifice pigs will perish in the afterlife; their souls will not have any vital force (mana)" (1923:92). As mentioned, the influence the ancestors have over their living descendants is directly correlated with their grade and so with their degree of ta-mat. Another indicator, possibly, of efficacy as an aspect of ta mat is that men on Vao state that it is a "strong" thing not to eat with women and that it is necessary to do something "strong" after making a Maki sacrifice (Layard 1955:289). Also, the Atchin ta-mats is referred to as a "spiritual or 'ghostly' force" by Layard (1952:289)', and an old man of high grade is called a ta-mats on Atchin while he is still alive "because his increasing ghostly power [i.e., his ta-mats] is now recognized as being more powerful than his waning physical strength" (?bid.:291) (editor's insertion in brackets). Although no one of these points, by itself, suggests strongly that ta-mat is a sort of power, the combination of these points plus the identity of ways in which the newly incised and the new grade-takers are treated do firmly suggest that power is an attribute or consequence of ta-mat, if not a definition of it. Furthermore, the Oxford English Dictionary defines "power" as "ability to do or act; vigour, energy; active property; influential person, body, or thing." These meanings of "power" agree with the characterization of ta-mat that has been given in the examples of its uses above. An indication of the nature of ta-mat is provided by Layard's statement that, at the moment of sacrifice, "the ghost (ta-mats) or spirit of the boar as it breathes out its last is then thought of as flowing into the sacrificer" (1952:290). Layard speaks also of the sacrificer as being "infused with the sanctification of the boar" (ibid.:290). So, it appears, ta-mat is regarded as transmitted as a fluid. What form it takes when resident in a pig or man is another, unknown matter. Prohibitions Rather than delimit an area of possible study before consideration of the relevant ethnographic data, it seems more worthwhile and less open to the possibility of superimposition of Western categories to describe the concepts of Vao first. For this reason, this section has been entitled "prohibitions" rather than "taboos" or "sacredness." The categories of different kinds of prohibitions will be delineated first, and then ? and only then ?will it be possible to gain an idea of what Layard means by "taboo" and "sacred." "Vel-val" means "to fast, to abstain from certain foods" (77). The hyphen is used by Layard to indicate the component parts of the word (759), though he makes no suggestion as to what the meaning of those component parts might be. "Vel val" refers (1) to those rules of abstinence applied during the hollowing out of the gongs, a process that is part of the gong raising rites (355); (2) to the rules observed by the Ma/c/'-men and their wives after sacrifice in both Ramben and Maki Ru; and (3) to the rules against eating certain kinds of yam during the period of mourning for a young man (563). The term is used not only for the rules themselves but also for the people observing these rules (400). In Lambumbu, northwestern Malekula, "vilval" means "to observe restrictions concerning sex, food, and drink, etc., 4. Since the Oxford English Dictionary defines "psychic" in terms of "spiritualistic phenomena," and since the kind of power under discussion is derived from the ancestors, it seems best to rename it "spiritual power." This is not to be confused with ta-mat, for although Layard translates "ta-mat" as "spiritual power" (1952:290), that definition is not being employed in this thesis.</page><page sequence="8">McClancy: Vao concepts 77 preparatory to performing ceremonies or working magic" (Deacon 1934:754). "Vilval" appears to be both phonetically and semantically very similar to "vel-val"; this suggests that they are philologically related. The people of Lambumbu also come into contact with the people of Vao through trade (Layard MS). In Seniang, southwestern Malekula, "(i)vel" means "to observe certain restrictions connected with sex, food, drink, etc.," and the noun "(ni)velian" means "the observance of such restrictions" (Deacon 1934:753). These restrictions are observed as part of the preparation for working magic, entering a Nalawan grade "etc." (ibid.). Like "vilval," the phonetic and semantic similarity of "(i)vel" and "(ni)velian" to "vel-val" suggests a philological association between them. In the above definition, made by Deacon, "restrictions" have been substituted for "taboos," the term in the original statements, for he appears to use "taboo" as simply a translation of "restriction" (1934:684). In this way, we can help prevent the premature use of the word "taboo," which has been used as a general term, though one with a number of different meanings (see Steiner 1956). From the above, it appears that "vel-val" refers to a set of restrictions that are concerned with ceremonies that involve the transmission of ta-mat (i.e., the Maki and death). These restrictions are contextual in that they are status specific. They are used to demarcate temporary ritual statuses. This tends to agree with Lane's statement about the beliefs of the natives of south Pentecost ? that power implies a sense of "forbidden" (1965:258). It would appear that one must come into contact with ta-mat only in appropriate situations that are hedged around with numerous vel-val. The possible consequences of inappropriate acquaintance with ta-mat can be indicated by two pertinent beliefs: (1) that one can be attacked by a ta-mat oamp when abroad at night (235), and (2) that if a man were to sacrifice a boar that had been raised to a grade too far beyond his own in the Maki, the transmission of the boar's ta-mat into the man would be overwhelming and the man's death would be imminent (262). The noted philological relations of "vel-val" also refer to those sets of restrictions concerned with the performance of ceremonies or the working of magic. Unfortunately, Deacon does not specify the relevant ceremonies, nor does Layard give the Vao term for the rules of abstinence observed during performances involving magic (man). Layard defines "tamp" as "sacred" and states that it is only found in the term "na-tamp," which means a lodge and its cemetery (63). He claims that it is a variant of the Polynesian word "tabu" (63), although Demplwolff indicates that it may also be related to UAN (PAN) "*ta(m)ba?," meaning "to offer; or else, antidote, remedy, medicine" (1934-1938, vol. 3:124). By "sacred," Layard appears to mean "prohibited" and "associated with a predominantly unearthly category" (what we might term "holy" or, in the case of Vao, ta-mat, Ta-ghar, or Le-hev-hev), for he states that it is because "vel-val" means both certain rules and those observing them that it can be translated as "sacred" or "taboo" (400) and that the Atchin word for "sacred" is "e-tsats," which covers "bad, holy, and taboo" (Layard MS). Layard appears to be using "taboo" in the sense of "proscriptive rule," since the restrictions that he classes under "Taboo" in his index appear to be an ethnographer's imposed category. The conventional rules that he categorizes separately under the headings "Abstinence," "Prohibitions," "Restrictions," and "Taboos" in his index have nothing common within each category other than that they are all rules, and this attribute cuts across Layard's categories rather than defining them in opposition to one another. These four also do not uniquely correspond to any Vao terms, such as the ones being discussed in this section. "Restriction," "prohibition," or "proscriptive rule" will be the terms employed in this section rather than "taboo," given the variety of meanings that have been attributed to "taboo" and the resultant confusion that has occurred (see Steiner 1956). In the present case, Layard most likely defines "tamp" as "sacred" because the cemeteries, to which "na-tamp" essentially refers, are the depository for the dead bodies of old, honored men who would, presumably, have had a large amount of ta-mat by the time they died, and because access to the na-tamp is strictly prohibited to women (63). "Tutu," ("toto," "tuto") and "g(h)ore" mean "to bind, place a taboo on"; they are used also for placing a cycas leaf or other object in order "to taboo a tree or a road" (774). "G(h)ore" means both "to restrict" and "to open, remove a restriction" (763). Both meanings were recorded without discrimination (763). "Tutu ghore" means "to retain the right to one's child" (189), "tutu gore," means "to retain (i.e., betroth) a bride" (194), and "to-to ghore" means "to serve (i.e., bind around) the purlins of a ghamal with coconut sinnet" (442). "Tutu" is most likely related to PAN "tut' tut'," which means "to tie together, to bind up" (Dempwolff 1934-1938, vol. 3:144). Similarly, "g(h)ore" is related possibly to the Seniang term "nggor," meaning "to bar, to obstruct" (Deacon 1934:748) and to the west Ambrym term "goro," meaning "around, between, (blocking); in the middle of; protecting; (often with the sense of tabu or similar sanction surrounding a person or thing" (Paton 1973:58). That is, in their philological relations and in the majority of their uses on Vao, "tutu" and "g(h)ore" both appear to be mainly concerned with the imposition and removal of restrictions. "Ghat" and "hat" both mean "bad," in the sense of "powerful" or "feared" (728). Layard claims that they also mean "sacred" or "taboo" (522). He gives the example of the name of the man "too holy to be incised," Ta-malo-hat (522). Unfortunately, he does not know the meaning of "malo," and I have been unable to find any phonetically similar word in the vocabularies of nearby groups' ethnographies or in Dempwolff (1934-1938). As mentioned above, "sacred" and "taboo" must be taken as "prohibition associated with an</page><page sequence="9">78 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 'unearthly' category" and "proscriptive rule," respectively, when used by Layard. "Ghat" and "hat" appear to be related to a family of AN words meaning "to be bad." The corresponding words on Atchin are "e-tsats" and "ats," respectively (Layard MS). The west Ambrym term "hakbe" means "bad, wicked, evil, ill" (Paton 1973:61). Dempwolff constructs the UAN wordbase "d'ahat" meaning "badness," also quoting the Fijian "za&lt;," "to be bad"; "zat/a&lt;," "to hate"; the Sa'a "ta&gt;a&lt;" "to be bad"; the Tongan "ha&gt;a&lt;" "to be in disorder"; and the Futunan "sa&gt;a&lt;," "to be unsuitable, inappropriate, out of place" (1934-1938, vol. 3:46). Layard himself claims that "ghat" is related to the Indonesian "jahat" (762), and this seems likely, given the above. It was Deacon who discovered the property (i)gah, which is especially associated with women "and, by analogy, to the female of all species, as, for instance, a sow." It is strongly antipathetic to things that are (i)leo, the corresponding property associated with men and all things male (1934:23). "Igah" and "ileo" are kinds of "sanctity" and must be kept separate, for their inappropriate conjunction leads to the destruction of one of them. Both are capable of degrees and are associated with their respective sexes' ritual societies (ibid.:478). Although Deacon considers them both to be forms of "sanctity," "/7eo" is translated as "sacred" in his glossary (ibid.:742), but "igah" is translated as "unclean, in the sense in which things appertaining to women are 'unclean' " (ibid.:28). Just what his evidente may be is not given. In Oba, an island that has direct contact with the people of Vao through trading relationships and the performance of ritual (e.g., 523), the natives of Nduindui have a similar conception of sexually opposed properties. Hati is an attribute predominantly, but not exclusively, associated with women. Things that are particularly hati are menstrual blood and faeces. Hati is opposed to kokona, hati persons and objects being "especially dangerous" to men who have acquired the opposite kokona attributes by performing ritual. Inappropriate contact with hati persons and objects can seriously "endanger" a man's health and destroy his kokona "sanctity." Interestingly, M. R. Allen states that, in broader terms, "hati" connotes "bad power." It is a form of "supernatural power" that has, however, no ritual counterpart (1972:280). Kokona is predominantly associated with men. It is a "form of power," "sanctity," or "ritual potency," and its incidence is marked by proscriptive rules. It is acquired by sacrificing pigs and thus increases as one passes through the Hungwe, the local form of the graded society (M. R. Allen 1967:116-118). Kokona is a class term that subsumes a number of different, more specific kinds of "powers" (e.g., mana and tangaroa) (M. R. Allen 1972:278). These ethnographic examples from groups connected directly or indirectly with Vao strongly suggest that Layard's translation of "hati" as "bad," in the sense of "powerful" or "feared," is not an ethnographer's inference from insufficient data, even though, as shown above, none of the terms included in the UAN wordbase "d'ahat" have this particular connotation. It is possible to begin to gain an idea of the existence of a similar opposition of forms of power on Vao also, though this procedure must be, given the circumstances, highly inferential. Women on Vao have their own Maki (452), sacrifice pigs in their own right, take special grade names for themselves (453), and have their own lodges (47). On Atchin two large dolmens situated close to the ,ower side of the dancing ground of the village of Pweter-ts?ts are connected with the women's Maki there (731). As men in the Maki sacrifice acquire ta-mat, which is the point of the Maki (Godefroy 1933:229), it would be expected that something would be acquired from the pig in the females' Maki sacrifice as well. Since ta-mat is predominantly associated with maleness and since everything associated with it is prohibited to women, it is very unlikely that the sacrifice of pigs would involve the transmission of ta-mat from the pigs into women. In the men's Maki only boars are sacrificed individually. This suggests that perhaps women sacrifice sows in their Maki. Unfortunately, however, Layard did not discover the sex of the women's sacrificial pigs, nor whether they were tusked or untusked, or gelded or ungelded (453). It may be pertinent to add that women may own sows on Vao (384) and that when a woman comes to sacrifice in her own sex's Maki, it appears to us most likely that she would use what she herself owns and has tended, rather than something taken from a man's estate..Thus, it seems likely that a woman would sacrifice a sow. Also, as mentioned above, it is necessary to use a boar that one has reared oneself in the individual men's Maki sacrifices in order for transmission of ta-mat to occur, and this also suggests that women would sacrifice sows, since they do not rear their own boars. Layard's information about the women's Maki is "unfortunately meagre" (453), and he does not try to draw out implications from the data that he does have on this topic, except in order to make a comparative survey of women's graded institutions (728-731). If we make the inference that the existence of the women's Maki indicates the occurrence of a concept analogous to ta mat, but in opposition to it, just as igah is opposed to /7eo and hati to kokona, then the most likely known candidate for this concept is hat. Layard himself states that "variants of the word hat are fairly constant to that kind of women's sanctity that is frequently referred to as 'bad' " (728). His informant on Vao was male (xix), and if a female form of ta-mat was believed to exist, then it would, by analogy with igah and hati most likely be an object of "fear" and would be regarded as "powerful" by men; this is just how Layard defines "hat" (764). That "hat" would have this meaning when spoken about by a group of women is a doubtful proposition. What person would wish to increase a form of power that was regarded by all as bad unless it was to be used for sorcery? Layard gives no indication, or even vague suggestion, that hat is connected in any way such as philologically, conceptually, or</page><page sequence="10">McClancy: Vao concepts 79 metaphysically, with any kind of sorcery on Vao or Atchin. Similarly, neither hati nor igah appears to be asssociated with sorcery. Layard does mention, though, that on the Small Islands the word corresponding to "/7eo" is "kon" (728). Just as "hat" seems to be philologically related to "hati," "kon" may be related similarly to "kokona," for Layard defines "kon" as "taboo, holy; particularly referring to men" (765). "Kon" and "won," which is said to mean "sacred" (776), are both Atchinese words but are grouped together with the Vao term "hon" by Layard. "Hon" is said to mean "sacred" also (584, 764). "Won " is also found on Vao, since the personal name of the man who was "too holy to be incised" was "Kalo won," meaning "holy penis" (522, 776). In west Ambrym "kon" means "to be holy, tabu" (Paton 1973:99) and in Port Sandwich, southeast Malakula, "kon" means "to be tabu, to be forbidden" (Charpentier 1974:134). Thus, "hon," "kon," and "won" appear to be very closely related philologically, given their semantic and phonetic similarity. These points allow us to suggest that, just as "?leo" and "kokona" are opposed to "igah" and "hati," respectively, so may "hon" be opposed to "hat" on Vao.5 Acceptance of this final statement is dependent, of course, on agreement with the chain of inferences that preceded it. There are certain restrictions, however, that are mentioned in Layard's monograph but are not specifically included under any one of the native terms discussed in this section. Among this amorphous collection are the few restrictions that are permanent on Vao. These permanent restrictions are manifestations of the division of the sexes: women are permanently barred from the ghamal (60), from the large sea going canoes (254), from the men's path connecting the village and the beach (32), from the dancing ground, except on certain specified occasions (34), and from eating with men and cooking food for them, except on certain occasions (45). Men are permanently barred from the women's lodges (73). If we follow Layard's use of the term "sacred," as it has been elicited above, then it is possible to make some general statements about its incidence on Vao. First, sacredness is marked by the acquisition of a new name. Everything in the Vao world, whether animate or inanimate, is said to possess a name; "only," as one native put it, "we do not always know what it is" (450). Whenever someone, or something, has a boar sacrificed for it, he or it takes on a new name. Examples of this are given for men (271), women (563), canoes (469), dolmens (450), and a ghamal (76, 447). Second, sacredness, like ta-mat, is capable of degrees. When in use, all sacred monuments in Vao must not be touched, or trodden on, by men. Once they have been used, however, this restriction is lifted. The monuments, however, may never be shifted, and remain prohibited to women. Similarly the account of the man "too holy to be incised" also implies degrees of sacredness. Tree-fern effigy, Ambrym, New Hebrides. 240 cm. Private col lection, New York. (S. Sloman) 5. Following the philological evidence, "kon" may also be regarded as opposed to "hakbe" on west Ambrym.</page><page sequence="11">80 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 Man This is a category with an extremely wide extension. It embraces powers that are used for both magical and medicinal purposes (the natives do not recognize any distinction between the two). The word "man" implies the possession of "psychic" power and of knowledge of the appropriate ritual acts and incantations, and, where necessary, of the appropriate physical remedies as well. It is also applied to the magical or curative process itself (628). Everyone on Vao, regardless of sex, is acquainted with "man" in some form, which they are able to perform (629). An immense variety of magical acts cover almost every aspect of life, both public and private, though the examples that Layard recorded are relatively few (173, 354, 379, 422, 560, 628-641). Although the forces that a magician may wish to appeal to, or to control, vary (in some cases it may be ta-mat (630-632); in others the weather, human emotions, perhaps the growth of pigs [641]), the structure of the rite remains the same. It consists of four main elements: (a) abstinence and fasting and observance of certain prohibitions; (b) the concrete medium, such as a stone, together with the ritual actions; (c) a song or incantation; (d) a muttered prayer (641). Elements (a), (b), and (c) are rigidly fixed. The prayer that is addressed to specific ancestors is fixed in all important rites, but lesser ones, apparently to the concrete medium (such as a stone), provide the only element in which the magician can express his own personality in the form of the actual words chosen (641). The kinds of prohibitions and concrete media are limited in number, though the length of time that they must be observed and the way in which they are used vary from rite to rite. Only the song is entirely different for each magical act (641-642). The words of a song are fixed, except for, in certain cases, the addition of the name of the new magician to the long list of previous magicians each time the ownership of the rite changes hands (641). On Vao and Atchin, magical procedure is connected almost exclusively with the number four. Layard states, "In almost every magical performance of which I have sufficient record, either four leaves or other objects are used ... or else all or part of the action is repeated four times, or else the incantation, itself usually consisting of four parts, is sung four times in succession. In some cases all these types of repetition are included in one and the same rite, in others the magical number occurs in one or other element in the procedure. In all cases the magical number is four" (644). Interestingly, the only time Lane refers explicitly to numbers in his account of the natives of south Pentecost is the association of four and sorcery (mlinik) (1965:260). In attempting to explain why the number four is regarded as important, as opposed to others, Layard displays its incidence in other spheres of life on Vao and finally offers a psychological interpretation (644-648). It is stated that the division of the village of Pete-hul into four quarters is referred to by the natives as "straight" or as "ideal" and that this perfect order is mythically regarded as having been due to the direct action of Ta-ghar (68, 646). So the striking incidence of the number four in magical rites may be due to the fact that such rites are concerned with the handling of unseen forces, such as ta-mat, and the channeling of it, once produced, and in the right situation, and that such handling of forces is a risky activity. Thus, four, which is regarded as "ideal" and is associated with Ta-ghar in one occurrence, may possibly be seen in this situation as an indication of the control the magician has over his equipment, for it indirectly invokes an aspect of the creator-deity who is "in all ways good" (218). One form of magic was even first learnt by a woman called Le-taghar, who, one night while asleep, was told the necessary procedures by ta-mat (633). The importance of control over the forces that a magician manipulates is shown also by the various prohibitions that surround him before and during the performance of a rite (641) and by the possible sanction of the ghostly hierarchy of previous magicians, who jealously guard the forms of the rites that they have handed down (642). An example of the need for control is given by Godefroy. He mentions a practitioner who brought about wind but was unable to restrain the resultant cyclone, so becoming liable for the damage it caused (1933:246). The importance of control in magical rites is particularly emphasized by Deacon in his fascinating account of magic in southwestern Malekula (633-697). He stresses the importance for the performer of magical rites of putting himself in the rigidly defined appropriate condition. By observance of exacting prohibitions, the performer safeguards himself against forces that do not endanger the ordinary man to which he is otherwise vulnerable and insures the "efficacy" or "potency" of his magic. If he fails to observe these rules of abstinence or to carry out the rite in precisely the prescribed manner, the magic he is attempting to manipulate will act on him as well as on his victim (683-686). These kinds of remarks are echoed in Endicott's An Analysis of Malay Magic, where he states that the control a magician has over his equipment gives him power over the essences that he is dealing with (1970:145). Color As Johnson points out, the symbolism of color is a subject particularly problematic owing to the difficulties inherent in trying to determine whether the color (as aspect) of an object is given a greater significance than the object itself (1976:156). He illustrates the possible pitfalls anthropologists can make on this topic by showing how Barth created a</page><page sequence="12">McClancy: Vao concepts 81 color-based semantic classification that was meaningless to the Baktaman, the Nuiguinean group that he studied (Barth 1975). (According to Johnson, the Baktaman classify an object only as an object, or by its use or function in a given context [1976:157]). Given this kind of difficulty, it will be necessary while discussing color to stay particularly close to the facts and to the symbolic interpretations already given. Consequently, any inferences that will be made about what a certain color symbolizes in a particular context will rest on much more conjectural grounds than in other areas of study where inferences are made about an object, such as stone, acting as a symbolic vehicle, as opposed to an aspect of the object acting in this manner. One possible way to circumvent these difficulties might be to pay particular attention to the occasions where color is an object, not an aspect of one, i.e., where paint is used. But doubt can be raised about this, since what may be important in a particular act is not the color of the paint applied but the instrumental value of applying the paint, its color being a symbolically indeterminate dimension of the event. So when the speaker paints the nipples of members of the introducing "line" red during the announcement of the date of the great sacrifice in Maki Ru, the fact that this paint is red is not mentioned by the natives, nor is any meaning of the act provided by Layard other than a possible interpretation in terms of a symbolic rebirth (376). This event may be seen as a possible use of color, or paint, itself. This suggestion gains greater credence when it is noted that Layard translates "na ul" as meaning both "return of the dead" and "paint" (376). But before accepting this translation, it is necessary to examine the word "ul" first. To begin with, it appears to be a complex or multifaceted concept on Vao. "A-ul" means "high" (774), "a-" being a prefix indicating direction (760). It is found in the title of the highest Maki grade, Melteg-aul (432), which, as noted above, means "the first in everything and everywhere" (Godefroy 1933:243). The upper side of a dancing ground is called tosan aul (64), "tosan" meaning "the other side" (57). "Che tur a-ul" means "stand up" (371), "ghe" being the second-person plural indefinite verbal pronoun (762), and "tur" meaning "to stand" (178, 774). "Hul" also means "high" on Vao (75, 764). This meaning of "ul" and "hul" may well be related to UAN "*(h)ulu," which is equivalent to the PMP "*qu/u?," both of which mean "head." The Tongan and Futunan '^ulu," the Toda Batak "&gt;ulu&lt;," the Javanese //&gt;u/u&lt;," the Samoan "ulu," the Fijian "ulu" all mean "head" also (Dahl 1973:28; Dempwolff 1934-1938, vol. 3:162; Milner 1966:299; Capell 1957:290). "Ul" is associated also with "return," especially that of the dead. "Ombu na-ul" is the name of the rite in which a man playing the part of a recently deceased honored old man speaks from his grave, saying that he has come from his mother's village (546-547). A single live pig is given to the dancers of Hek-hekelean ("Settling Down") "in return" for their exertions. This pig is called "ne-ul" (371), "ne-" being a separable or inseparable article preceding many nouns (769). On Atchin, the driftwood used by the dead when they return to Malekula from Ambrym is called "ulu-nu-amp" (Layard MS), "nu-" being a possessive root and "amp" meaning "fire" (760). Also on Atchin, the sea annelid that arrives in swarms once a year, an event coincident with the annual return of the dead (6), is called "ne-ul" (Layard MS). On Wala, the anniversary communion feast for an honored old dead man is called "Bong-ul," meaning "feast of the 'ul'." During this feast, the "spirit" of the dead man returns in order to eat special yams that have been roasted over a fire (Layard MS). Layard claims that this meaning of "ul" is related to the Indonesian "ulih," which means "turn," and "pulih," which means "return." He may well be correct about the philological relatedness of "ulih" and "ul," since Dempwolff constructs the UAN wordbase '^ulih," meaning "to return, come back" (1934-1938, vol. 3:161). The UAN wordbase "pulih," however, means "to reestablish, to build" (1934-1938, vol. 3:122). But the general point is still made that the two meanings of "ul" on Vao appear to come from different roots. As noted above, Layard claims also that "na-ul" can mean "paint." The only contextual example of this usage he gives is "na-ul na Maki," which he translates as "Maki paint" (376) and which is the name used for the paint with which the speaker coats the nipples of the introducing "line," as mentioned above. Given that this is the only example adduced to back up such a translation, given that no philologically related word with a similar meaning can be found in UAN or PAN or any Vanuatan language, given that on Vao the term is apparently not used in any other context that involves the use of paint, given that the words meaning "paint" in Fijian are "/ boro" (Capell 1957:422), in Samoan are "C^o le)vali" (Milner 1966:408), that in Maori the word is "paui" (Tregear 1891:651), and that in the dialect of Seniang, southwestern Malekula, the word is "tus" (Deacon 1934:753), and given that all these appear to be philologically unrelated to "ul" and that philological relations and more than one contextual example are provided for both of the other meanings of "ul," it seems justifiable to suggest that "na-ul na Maki" should be translated as "return of the Maki." This agrees with the fact that the context within which this paint is used is the announcement of the great sacrifice in Maki Ru (376). The purpose of this philological digression has been to show that what is important in certain ritual events may well be not the color of the paint but the application of the paint itself. The few occurrences of the colors black and white suggest that both are associated with death. An old man's face is painted black when he dies (540); on the fifth day after death, the mortuary officials and also the sons and other close kinsmen of the dead man blacken themselves all over in token of his arrival at the land of the dead (544); similarly, on the fifth day after the death of a young man, his relatives</page><page sequence="13">82 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 blacken their faces (560). A native, Val-vale, covered himself in white ashes when his son was killed (609). However, in both Ramben and Maki Ru, the chief Maki men who carry out the most important individual sacrifices have their faces blackened (393, 409). In their hair they wear hawks' or cocks' feathers ? black or white, depending on rank (393). Unfortunately, Layard does not tell us which color is associated with which rank, if any such association exists. These snippets of information allow us to say that, overall, black and white both appear to be associated with the transmission of ta-mat, whether at the death of a man or a pig. However, a more definite statement than this we cannot make. Red is the most important ritual color on Vao (752). It acts as a symbolic vehicle in a number of different contexts. Two kinds of red yam, called "uhungere" and "la-las," both symbolize blood (51 7). The red fruit of the ghavigo, or "malay apple," is symbolic of the incision wound made during the rite of initiation into manhood (508). Also, red hibiscus flowers are "emblematic" of this wound (518). All these symbols occur within the framework of the initiation into manhood (493-523). The central act of this rite is the incision made on the novices' penises. Blood flows from this wound, this being the only occasion throughout the rite when any bleeding intentionally occurs. Thus, it does not seem fanciful to suggest that the red fruits symbolizing blood refer to the incision. Since we have accepted Layard's hypothesis that incision is a sacrifice of oneself conferring spiritual power located in the mutilated part (478), it can be inferred that the red fruits mentioned are symbolically associated with this unnamed, undifferentiated power. The memel tree is a very tall one on Vao. It has high branches, throwing down lianas on which grow the memel fruit. This fruit is large and red and, of its kind, is unique on Vao (Godefroy 1936:78). Ta-ghar mythically caused one of these fruits to fall. It split into two parts, which turned into the first man and woman on Vao (79). The red la-las yam and the red "will-o'-the-wisp" of a ta mat oamp can both symbolize violent death (631). A young man's face is painted red after his death (559). This may be due to the indigenous attitude that any death is a tragic event and is due to the anger of offended ghosts or sorcery. The only exception is that of an old man's death, which is regarded as part of the natural train of events (536). As one native said, "At the death of a young man, we are sorry that his life has been cut off. . . . But for an old man, his time is finished and it is right that he should die, so that we do not mourn, but adorn ourselves" (536). A young man's death is unnatural, and so the red color of his face, like the will-o'-the wisp of a ta-mat oamp, may possibly symbolize violent death. The erythina tree's red flowers blossom after it has shed its leaves. This exceptional behavior is very noticeable, being highlighted by the background of green, dense bush. This event occurs during the July-August moon, which has the same name as the tree. The flowering proclaims the approach of the intensive calculations leading to the important decision as to which of the two moons ? October or November ? is the one in which the dead are expected to make their annual return into the land of the living (421). The caps worn by the Ma/c/'-men's wives for a period of one or two years after their husbands have performed individual Maki sacrifices are made of plaited matting that is dyed red in a variety of patterns. They are called "mbagh mbagh" (396). Layard claims that this comes from a root (Atchin "pek"), "meaning 'to carry on the head,' probably related also to the Vao "mbek-mbek" (Atchin "pek-pek"), signifying 'a fine' " (396). "Mbagh-mbagh" is also the word for "compensation" (437). The suggestion that this term is related to "fine" or "consequence of breaking a rule" is strengthened by the fact that in Lambumbu, northwestern Malekula, the term "mbutag" means "to lay a prohibition on objects by saying of them 'mbutag' " (Deacon 1934:103). The caps are thrown into the sea in the fifth or sixth year of the Maki, signifying the end of that part of the whole Maki (408). An expert magician (mara man) is employed to mark out the exact length and position of the slit of a log before it is hollowed out into a gong. Part of his equipment is a stick of native sugar cane (na-t?v), which is hit with an adze, so that the expelled juice leaves a mark on the surface of the log. The sugar cane is invested with magical import (ne-man), and Layard mentions that one special property of it is its red color (354). This connection between man and redness is too tenuous, however, for us to claim that it is an example of a direct association between them. Interestingly, in Seniang, southwestern Malekula, the term "(na)nrei" means both "blood, sap of a tree" and "a bright red paint of great sanctity made from certain earth" (Deacon 1934:748). Again, however, our general lack of information about the meaning of red prevents us from inferring much from such a quotation, highly suggestive though it is. The only other use of red that appears to be at all symbolically important is the painting of a bride's face vermilion just before she begins the procession to her husband's house (196). The path leading to his house is decorated with an array of yam poles, which are garlanded with dark red amaranthus flowers (194-195). The use of red here may signify "the violent death" of the bride's virginity, the destruction of her hymen, and the resultant bleeding. Unfortunately, however, Layard gives no idea of the extent to which girls partake of premarital sexual intercourse; so the above suggestion must also remain at a very speculative level. If we collate this material, we can see that all three colors ? black, white, and red ? appear to be associated with, or are expressions of, the transmission of ta-mat, whether in the form of the return of the dead, death itself, association with the Maki sacrifices, or the intake of spiritual power, which is a necessary prerequisite for the acquisition of ta-mat. This statement would agree with Layard's otherwise particular claim that red symbolizes death (1930:515).</page><page sequence="14">McClancy: Vao concepts 83 Numbers The symbolism of numbers is another problematic subject of study, for the use of them is implicit in the way that we describe events. Simply to state the number of days between the occurrence of two events is to involve oneself in enumeration. The difficulty that arises is the attempt to ascertain which uses of numbers are totally contingent and which are significant and desirable.6 One indicator that can act as an aid in this task is the change of numbers in any one situation. The number of grades of the Maki has, for instance, changed over time. In the late nineteenth century there were four grades (289). In 1915 there were two (272), and by 1933 there were five (Godefroy 1933). What happens to be important about grades is the serial acquisition of them by any one individual, not their number. Unfortunately, historical information is unavailable for much of Vao life; so the danger of falsely assuming importance and/or stability over time remains a real possibility in what follows. All instances of two, three, and nine are contingencies, such as the three so-called Quarters (or wards) of the village Togh-vanu (65, 91). Although there are numerous examples of dichotomy in Vao life (813), the number two, which is the consequence of any binary division of a totality, does not appear to be an important aspect of those examples. The number four has already been discussed in the section of man. It seems very difficult to draw out any common denominator from the uses of the number five: the dead, according to one account, take five days to reach the land of the dead (227), whence is derived the importance of the events occurring during the mortuary rites on the fifth day after death (536, 544, 560, 564). A newborn child is ritually named five days after birth (1 77). It is on the fifth day after an incision that the heaviest restrictions are removed (515, 521). Layard thinks that five is a rebirth number (576), but since there has been good reason to doubt his interpretation of the incidence of symbolic rebirth, his suggestion about five will be ignored here. The only reported incidence of the number six is that six days after the incision operation, the new initiates are allowed to bathe. Because this is its only incidence, and because the raising of the restriction is only one of a series that proceeds over a number of days (510), it seems safe to say that six is symbolically unimportant. A young man's head falls off on the seventh day after his death (560). Other than seven's occurrence in the initiation rites (475, 507, 518), this is the only example of its use in Vao. Layard argues that it is associated with the newer form of culture and that five is associated with the older (544, 561, 643). Since the diffusion of culture seems to have proceeded in a northerly direction, from the Malekulan mainland to Wala and from there to Vao via Atchin (Layard MS), this appears to be a plausible hypothesis. The residual difficulty, though, is that we still do not know what the significance of seven is other than its association with mortuary rites and initiation ritual. The only incidence of eight is that a kava root is raised eight times by the speaker just before he announces the date of the great Maki sacrifice (377, 472). Layard suggests that eight is to be regarded as a doubling of four (646). This seems the most plausible hypothesis, though the kind of kava used in the Maki is a long variety (ne-ghe), as opposed to the short (malogh), which is used in magical rites (376). Ten, and multiples of it, is found throughout ritual life. It occurs most commonly in the Maki (180, 388, 350, 371, 372, 377, 378, 412, 422, 425), though it does not appear to be associated with any one particular aspect of it. Particular Maki performances that have occurred in the past are referred to by numbers that are multiples of one hundred (293). On the tenth day after having given birth, a mother goes down to the shore to wash (1 79). The father of a mythical figure, To-wewe, had ten sons (286). One feature of mortuary ritual is that the number of days since a death are reckoned in tens (545); the tenth anniversary of the feast, for instance, is celebrated (559). Finally, the incision ritual lasts ten days (475). As was mentioned earlier, one particularly interesting aspect of ten is thirty. On the thirtieth day after birth, the infant is taken to the mainland for the first time by his mother (1 79). On the thirtieth day after a wedding, the bride is taken to her husband's house (198). In Maki Ru, Ramben, and the incision ritual, the new grade-takers and initiates, respectively, undergo a period of 30 days in seclusion (402, 430, 510). In all these examples, the participant is being reintroduced to the group in his/her new status. One possible reason for the incidence of this number is the lunar cycle, for it is the October-November moon that starts the ritual calendar (288), weddings take place on the day following the next full moon after the betrothal (194), and, of course, Ta-ghar, in his cosmological aspect, lives in the moon, where he begets children (212). Interestingly, two different systems of numbering are fused in the combination of seven and ten, leading to the 1 7-, 27-, or 37-day period elapsing between the announcement of the great Maki sacrifice and its performance (643). Although this combination suggests that both seven and ten are significant, it still gives no indication of what that significance may be. Sea The natives of the Small Islands call themselves "Sea Folk," in contrast to those living in Malekula, which is called the mainland. Malekula is not called an island and is not 6. For instance, the fact that there are normally 25 lines to a typewritten page does not indicate that twenty-five is symbolically significant but that it is convenient to have a standard number of lines per page. The particular number that is chosen, within the physical limits of the page, is unimportant. What counts is to keep to that number once it is chosen.</page><page sequence="15">84 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 Sculpted stone face, placed near Maki dolmen. (Courtesy T. Fowler) regarded as such (Layard MS). The importance of the sea to the people of Vao is shown by the number of ritual events that occur in connection with it, as shown below. Ta-ghar, in his anthropomorphic aspect, is connected with the sea. He is said to live in it in a canoe (Layard MS). All stone comes from the sea, or from the seashore, and this material, as will be shown below, is very closely associated with the ancestors. Conch-shell trumpets, which are associated with Ta-ghar (210), with the sacrifice of tusked boars (264) and humans (265), and with death (551) also come from the sea (264). Sea water is used in preference to rain water in the magical process for making rain (636). A seven-months pregnant woman has a new rope-girdle tied around her by her vene na man, or "female magician," down at the seashore. This is to prevent the child from being born too soon or dead or sickly (174). These events suggest that the sea is associated with ta-mat or man, and thus, indirectly, with power of one kind or another, for power is a consequence or attribute of ta-mat, and magic is concerned with the manipulation of various forces or powers. This suggestion is strengthened by a number of facts. The operation of incision occurs at the seashore and is immediately followed by the washing of the wounded penis in the sea (508). Since we have accepted Layard's hypothesis that incision is a sacrifice of oneself conferring spiritual power in the mutilated part (478), then a plausible suggestion is that this power emanates from, or is very closely associated with, Ta-ghar, who in turn is very closely associated with the sea (210), for, as was argued above, while they are distinct, ta-mat and spiritual power are closely related. Men ritually bathe in the sea (Godefroy 1933:210) after a day's work, mothers do so on the tenth day after the birth of their child (179), and novices do so when their canoe arrives at Oba during the initiation into sex (525). Men who have buried the body of a young man are aided by a magician "to get rid of the smell of the corpse"; they sip and spit out sea water four times and ritually bathe themselves (560). Among the natives of south Pentecost, "kon" is the word for "sacredness," and "konkon" refers to saltiness. Saltwater is an "important ingredient in ritual," being used "to exorcise and sanctify a new dwelling" (Lane 1965:258). In Nduindui, west Oba, both saltwater and the male form of "ritual potency" are called "kokona." Men can become kokona by having saltwater and coconut milk poured over them (M. R. Allen 1967:117). Since the sea is here being envisaged as a source of power, it is not surprising that it is made the object of proscriptive rules: it must not be seen by those practising na-leng dances (341) or by those undergoing seclusion after performing a Maki sacrifice (400). The latter prohibition is extended to include the Maki-men's wives (400). Power must be handled or manipulated very carefully, examples of this having been given above for ta-mat and man. The need for care when dealing with the power that is associated with the sea may be the reason why, as they are beached on Vao, the logs for gongs and canoes are purified (352, 465) by performing a sacrifice called "ra sale ghini ghowov te," meaning "we remove the saltwater from it (them)" (352). It is not clear, however, whether it is the logs themselves or their owners that are being purified (352). Stone This is obviously an important symbolic medium in Vao. The megalithic culture of the Small Islands was the original reason that Rivers and Layard chose to visit them. It was because of the natives' absorption in megalithic ritual, coupled with their beliefs about the association of ancestors and stone, that Layard chose the title "Stone Men of Malekula" for his monograph (19).</page><page sequence="16">McClancy: Vao concepts 85 The general term for stone is "vet" (418), though "vat" is used also (534). The most important uses of stone are for the construction of the dolmens and the stone platforms in Ramben and Maki Ru, respectively (272). It is on one of these that the major individual Maki sacrifices are performed (393, 430). The ta-mat of all the ancestors who have previously performed Maki inhabit, or hover near, these monoliths (12). Another example of the importance of stone is given by the people of Tolamp, a refugee community now resident on Vao (58). When they wished to celebrate the establishment of what would be their final dancing ground, they looked for a grand monolith worthy of the occasion (588). Two concomitants of this belief in the connection between the ancestors and stone are: (1) Any natural coral, or stone, block of unusually large size, or interesting appearance, is apt to be indicated as the dwelling place, or even the petrified personification, of some mythical hero. (2) On many of the Small Islands, though not Vao, the Guardian Ghost is believed to live in a stone and her mythical grandsons are now believed to be visible as coral blocks on the seashore (18). Among the natives of south Pentecost, stone is often thought of as "animate" (mir) (Lane 1965:254). Stone used in magical rites (man) may also be the dwelling place of ancestors (641). The concrete medium in the ritual of rain making is a diminutive stone ?mage that is regarded as representing both the founder of the rite and all those who have in turn used it, to all of whom the petition for rain is made (635). Evil influences causing sickness are often extracted by magicians in the form of a stone (632). "Pet" means "beginning, head, origin, or stone" (770). It is commonly found in the name of villages, e.g., Pete-hul, "High Stone"; Peter-ihi, "Three Stones" (770). These names both refer to the megalithic aspect of the Maki (75). Each village on Vao is divided into moieties called "tosan na-vatu," "Sides of the Stone" (62). These names may refer topographically to the megalithic aspect of the Maki, since on Atchin the two tosan na-vatu of a village set up their shrines on either side of the upper end of the dancing ground (168). A pile of stones is made on the beach at the point where the men's path to the village begins. Pigs are sacrificed on them, so that they become prohibited to women (Godefroy 1933:229). "Pet vatu," "head of the stone," is the name for the solid part of a slit gong between the top of the slit and the top of the gong (347). In Malekula and the Small Islands, the ancestors are believed to be speaking or giving voice when these gongs are struck (13, 35). Layard was not told this on Vao (310), but he does not say that he was told that they were not the voices of the ancestors, only that he has no information that would decide the issue. Since the natives of the Small Islands do claim an identity between the gongs and the voices of the ancestors, it seems a plausible inference to make that the same could be said of Vao. Stone's hardness and enduring qualities appear to distinguish it from the rest of nature. In the midst of rapidly growing vegetation and seasonal change, stone is unique in its unchanging aspect. Thus, stone may well represent stability over time. It may be considered the visible, tangible link between the present and the remembered past. When looked at from this aspect, it does not seem surprising that stone is associated with the ta-mat, for just as stone may physically represent continuity over time, so the ta-mat do the same metaphysically. Without ta-mat, there is no point in death and thus none in life. With ta-mat, not only has life meaning, but also the dead are still about and able to influence the lives of the living. So it would not be surprising that when the ta-mat return to their villages, this "metaphysical" form of continuity should reside in, or hover about, the physical form of continuity. r + i^tj ' Reverse of stone face, engraved pattern representing Le-hev hev. (Courtesy T. Fowler)</page><page sequence="17">86 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 Height The division of space is also concerned with ta-mat, for height is symbolic of spiritual aspiration (732). Thus "ul" means "high," as in "tosan aul," "the upper side of the dancing ground" (774). There is a belief about the existence of a sky world (bakerean), which is associated with the land of the dead in the crater of the Ambrym volcano (277). High grade men go up to live in the crater, which is about 3,300 ft above sea level (228), but low-grade men go down to live in a cave under the ground (238). The notion of the sky world is connected with ideas of light (732). Ta-ghar is light and is associated with height, for under his cosmological aspect he lives in the moon and is, by analogy, associated with the sun (218). Layard, however, thinks that it would be "dangerous to draw this parallel too far and to regard this idea of aspiration associated with height as being due to a belief in this deity," for reasons of a diffusionist nature (732). Although a belief in this deity may not be the causal origin of the symbolic vehicle of height, it may be the reason that height is still, in the ethnographic present, symbolically important. The sorts of reasons that lead to the introduction of a symbolic vehicle into a conceptual system need not be the same reasons for its continued existence in that system. So the hypothesis that height is a symbol of aspiring towards Ta-ghar seems a plausible one, though it needs further evidence in order to be firmly acceptable. The aspiration to height is symbolically expressed in the Maki by the image of a hawk. Wooden images of this bird surmount ancestral shrines (272, 378) and the ridge-pole of ghamals (441). Giant hawk banners are erected on very tall poles in both Ramben (373) and Maki Ru (422). In the na-leng dances preceding the great sacrifices, two men dance as hawks, scattering the Maki-men, who represent small birds (338). The chief sacrifices wear hawks' feathers in their hair and adorn their biceps with shell-bead armlets worked in geometric designs representing a hawk's face (393). The Vao word for hawk is "nambal" (767), "na-" being a separable or inseparable article preceding many nouns (768). "Mbal" also means "to sacrifice; to be sacrificed" (624). In the absence of any comparative philological evidence (Dempwolff does not list "to sacrifice," "hawk," or any of their cognates, and the Samoan "osi le ta?laga" (Milner 1966:428) and the Maori "whaka-hapainga" (Tregear 1891:655), both terms for "sacrifice," do not appear to be philologically related to "mbal"), Layard's statement that this evidence suggests that the hawk is identified with the Maki sacrificer and his victim (753) seems highly plausible. Thus, at the very moment of sacrifice, when the sacrificer is identified with his victim (257), he also becomes identified with the hawk and so briefly fullfills his aspiration to height. This aspiration is also symbolically expressed in the layout of the dancing ground: the men's side where the gongs, the ancestral shrines, and stone monuments lie is the upper side and is prohibited to women (59). Women can pass by only on the lower side. There is a progressive increase in the observance of the prohibition of women as one passes from the lower to the upper side. The dancing grounds are often so situated that any natural inclination in the level of the ground is taken advantage of. The "upper" side is often at the higher end of a slight slope (34). A ghamal has an artifically raised earth floor, the construction of which is accompanied by the sacrifice of a large number of pigs (448). This may be another example of the aspiration to height but could also be a possible example of how well the ghamal encloses its members from the outside, "undifferentiated," world, a category that would include women and unincised boys. The island of Vao itself is divided into two sides,7 the dominant village being Pete-hul ("hul" meaning "high" [764]), which was mythically founded by Ta-ghar (62). Fire Fire means "power" and "life" (178, 232). Just what kind of power this is should become evident below. The Ambrym volcano is called Bot-gharambi, "the source of fire" (228). It shoots flames into the air up to 900 m high (Godefroy 1936). Since the volcano itself is 3,300 ft above sea level (228), it is not surprising that, as Layard says, "the light of the volcano on Ambrym, when in eruption, is an impressive sight" (228). The crater is also the land of the dead. So there is a direct connection between the dead and the volcanic fire. The only other volcano that is visible from Vao is the one on Oba, the "land of Ta-ghar" (211, 523). The fires from its craters are just visible from Vao at night (Layard MS). The sun is also seen, by the inhabitants of Vao, to rise from the direction of Oba (ibid.). Thus, there is a direct geographical, as well as a symbolic, association between Ta-ghar and the sun. In one account, Ta-ghar is said to live up on the side of this volcano, which itself is called "the volcano of Ta-ghar" (Layard MS). So here we find an association between Ta-ghar and volcanic fire. Thus, the island of Oba can be regarded as a complex of symbolic associations: Ta-ghar, the sun, volcanic fire, and height. Also, with respect to both volcanoes, fire is associated with ta-mat, whether with it in the form of the dead or with its original source. Low-grade ta-mat, or those of no grade, live in caves on the east Malekulan coast. These caves contain small fires, which irritate the inhabitants continually but do not cause suffering. Although this may be another example of the 7. Layard was told that the sides of the island were called "superior" and "inferior." People living today on the "inferior" side dispute this terminology (but not the dichotomy): they are quick to point out that Layard's main informant came from the supposedly "superior" side. The sides are not a ranked division (T. Fowler, personal communication).</page><page sequence="18">McClancy: Vao concepts 87 association of fire and ta-mat, it may well be of a different kind from those just mentioned, since the fire in these caves is not like that in a volcanic crater but "is like a mass of sparks" (237). On the other hand, it may be the same kind of association; it may be one that differs in degree, not kind, from the other two examples; i.e., the size of the fire may be associated with the amount of power of the different kinds of ta-mat. The most ritually important use of fire on Vao is in the Maki. Just after sacrifice, a new fire is lit (410, 430, 704). From this time onwards, the Ma/c/'-men must cook all their food in the ghamal over fires that have been lit by brands from the "sacrificial" fire (45). Thus Ma/c/'-men's fires become prohibited to women, who must cook their own food separately (45). A torch lit from a Maki fire is briefly held beneath a supported neonate in order "to make it strong" (178). Just as the large volcanic fire symbolizes a large amount of ta-mat ? the land of the dead ? so does a small fire symbolize a small amount of ta-mat. Thus, certain torches symbolize tusked boars (305). When torches are used for this purpose, they are called "ne-sh?l," whereas "reh?re" is the name for them in ordinary speech. Ne-sh?l can be treated in one of three ways. Each different kind of treatment is a symbol of one of the three higher grades of tusked boars (304). These torches are carried in a number of dances that are performed throughout the Maki (326, 356, 424). During mortuary rites, Ombu na-ul is performed. The native acting the part of the dead man carries a torch, also called "ombu na-ul" (547). The meaning of "ombu" is not known, but "na-ul" means "return of the dead" (546). This appears to be another association between ta-mat and fire, an association that concords with the other examples. Interestingly, there is a similar association of "power" and heat among the natives of south Pentecost (Lane 1965:257). Canoes Canoes, unlike all other objects ? with the exception of pigs and men ? that have tusked boars sacrificed to them, have "souls" and personality (469). Although these attributes are not independent of those of its owner (470), it seems worthwhile to attempt to discern the possible reasons why canoes have "souls" and personality, whereas other objects, which also have tusked boars sacrificed to them, have none. Like men and pigs, canoes were first introduced by Ta-ghar (463). No other objects on Vao explicitly have Ta-ghar as their creator. An important purpose of canoes is trading in pigs (253). They are also used to ferry the dead to Ambrym (227). In both of these cases, they are concerned with the physical movement of ta-mat from one area to another. An imminent Maki is envisaged as a canoe coming from Oba, "the land of Taghar," laden with pigs (380), and the natives explicitly draw out the structural isomorphism of the layout of a Maki and that of a canoe (428). Just as the Maki is concerned with the passage of ta-mat from one category to another, so is a canoe concerned with a similar passage from one area to another. The Maki and canoes are, respectively, the contexts within which such passages can occur. Interestingly, To-wewe, the alleged founder of the Maki, mythically committed suicide by entering a hollow nev tree with his circle-tusker. Both died (286). The nev tree is the material out of which canoes are made (462). A ghamal is part of the Maki, but it is not a context within which passage of ta-mat occurs. It is a place where ta-mat is strengthened and maintained. Other than pigs and people, canoes are the only objects that have pigs sacrificed to them and can move. All other objects (e.g./stone used for ritual purposes, a ghamal) have to be moved by men. But a canoe can travel from one place to another, unaided by man. One might wish to claim that the ascription of "souls" and personality to canoes may well be Godefroy's imposition, by which he displays his own interests rather than those of the natives. Layard never independently mentions these attributes of canoes in his monograph, nor does he do so in his lengthy unpublished accounts of canoes on Atchin (Layard MS). Whenever he does mention these attributes, he always quotes Godefroy (469-471). Layard also displays how Godefroy misunderstands the nature of the sky world because of his own Christian interests (214-215). But even if this doubt is entertained and its implications accepted, this still does not explain why canoes have mortuary rites performed for them. The implication of performing a rite for something that has died is that it was once alive, and the only other category for which mortuary rites are performed is human persons who were once alive. The common execution of mortuary rites for humans and canoes does strongly suggest that the latter have "souls" and personality, and that the ascription of these attributes to canoes is not, most likely, an ethnographer's imposition. Thus, it seems reasonable to suggest that a canoe is not just regarded as just one more object among many that have tusked boars sacrificed to them, but has a "soul" and a Frigate bird and pig canoe prowhead. On the Small Islands of Malekula, the high-flying frigate bird is often equated with the hawk. (Courtesy T. Fowler)</page><page sequence="19">88 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 personality, since the kind of associations that it has are unique among such objects on Vao. Pigs Pigs are one of the most important categories of things on Vao. Sufficient examples of this have already been given for it to be unnecessary to attempt to prove this opening statement. What is interesting is their categorical status. Pigs are not the only animals on Vao. There are also, for instance, snakes, fruit bats, dogs, and rats (8). Other things may be sacrificed, such as ants, shell beads (na-sum), dogs, crabs (na-ghav), shellfish (na-ghar) (579), tawo nuts (284), flying foxes (452), and fowls (373, 413), but only pigs can make a "proper" Maki (579). Other than their size (they are the largest animals on Vao), their only features differentiating them from other animals are their artificially elongated tusks and the sacrifice of other pigs to them (Layard 1955:16). The first stage in a pig's acquisition of ta-mat is the knocking out of its upper canines, accompanied by sacrifice. The boar is at the same time tethered to a stake so that there is no chance of its breaking its tusks. This first "initiation" of the boar is equated by the natives with the initiation of the boys. The young boar is removed from its natural surroundings and is given its first title in the religious hierarchy of the boars (ibid.:289). In individual sacrifice in the Maki, a man will only sacrifice a tusked boar that he has very carefully tended and reared. The sacrifice of a traded boar would have no value for a grade-taker (Layard 1955:18). Men talk endlessly about boars, often imitating them by putting their curved fingers over the sides of their mouths (ibid.:16). Sows are of no value to men except in a reproductive capacity: they are neither sacrificed individually nor eaten in the Maki (242). All these points strongly suggest that Layard's statement ? that in individual sacrifice in the Maki the sacrificer can identify with his victim, this being a prerequisite for the transmission of ta-mat between the two ? is correct, though for reasons somewhat different from those that Layard adduces (Layard 1955:15-21). Thus, pigs can be seen to change category from "the undifferentiated" to "the differentiated" by the artificial elongation of their tusks and by the sacrifice of other pigs to them. Men undergo the same change by incision (480). Men rear and tend their own boars so that, at the appropriate moment, transmission of ta-mat can occur from one member of the "differentiated" category to another member with which it is identified. It may be pertinent to add that pigs' tusks appear to be similar in a number of ways to stone. After a Maki sacrifice, rows of the sacrificed boars' tusks are assembled on racks (e.g., see Layard 1942:402, pi. XVII). Like ritual stone monuments, these tusks are never removed and so can act as historical frameworks reminding the natives not only of each Maki and its size but also of the leading men who organized it and carried it through (16). Like stone, these tusks are both hard and durable, unlike almost everything else in Vao. Ta mat reside in and/or hover in the vicinity of stone monuments, whereas a pig's elongated tusks are a sign that other pigs have been sacrificed to it and that it is accumulating ta-mat. Among the natives of south Pentecost, tusks are artificially elongated in a manner identical to the way it is carried out on Vao. These tusks are said to "preserve the animateness" of a sacrificed pig. Stone is also often thought of as animate (mir) (Lane 1965:254, 279). To summarize, in both stone and tusks, we find a congruent conjunction of hardness, endurance, association with ta-mat, both have pigs sacrificed to them, and instances from both categories are taken out of their normal "undifferentiated" context and are made to act a part of Central importance in the Maki. Given this similarity, it is unsurprising that the two categories merge in one instance, that of the stone image of a pig. Layard states that he was shown the image and that it was "resting on a dolmen erected in front of a Lodge in the now deserted village of Tolamp" (262). He was unable to discover its purpose, however. This similarity suggests that, at the moment of the Maki sacrifice, which is coincident with the annual return of the dead (6), the latter are hovering or are resident in the ritual stone monuments as the ta-mat of the sacrificed boar is "infused" into the sacrificer. Thus, this all-important transmission of ta-mat occurs in the presence of more ta-mat, the dead. Conclusion Ta-mat is the "central concept" of Vao. In conjunction with the beliefs of the people of Vao, it gives meaning to the life after death, and thereby gives point to life itself. Within this context man is employed to ensure success in activities that will all ultimately lead to the acquisition of sufficient ta-mat. Layard thought "symbolic death and rebirth" the "key" by which Vao ritual life could be understood. To us, ta-mat appears to be the "key." It is through the elucidation of the scheme of categorical relations that we have come to understand Vao symbolic classification. "Opposition," as such, appears to play a relatively unimportant role in Vao. What has been ascertained in this article is the importance of continuity of life in the ideology of Vao. It is the relationships of ta-mat with other categories that sustain this continuity. Boys are differentiated from children and women by the intake of power; they gain in prestige with the intake of ta mat. Life and death are connected via ta-mat. And all of these</page><page sequence="20">McClancy: Vao concepts 89 events can occur only in the presence of more ta-mat: the dead. This function of ta-mat as "provider of continuity" between categories may possibly explain why it has so many different senses. Through a series of metaphors, the importance of ta-mat and its perfusion throughout Vao life is symbolically expressed in different ways and in a very large number of instances: black, white, and red appear to be associated with, or to be expressions of, the transmission of ta-mat. The numbers four, seven, eight, and thirty appear to be associated with the transmission of "metaphysical" powers, whether man, ta-mat, or "spiritual power." The importance of ta-mat enables us to appreciate the permanence of the prohibitions marking the division of the sexes. The contexts defined by ta-mat and Ta ghar are not only categorical but are also topographical: by symbolic association with fire and height, these "central" and "organizing" concepts indirectly map out the horizontal and vertical planes of the mystical world within which the people of Vao live. There is a certain amount of repetition in the text; but this repetition of the same examples in different contexts indicates, not a lack of available information, but the extent and number of interconnections and the variety of ways in which ta-mat is expressed symbolically. It is our understanding of "metaphysical" notions of power on Vao and their essential position within the corpus of Vao categories that provides us with a tool by which we can compare other cultures with that of Vao. From the particular we can move to comparison. BIBLIOGRAPHY Allen, M. R. 1967 Mate Cults and Secret Initiations in Melanesia.
