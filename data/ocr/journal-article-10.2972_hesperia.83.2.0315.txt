Roman Corinth’s role as urban leader  of the League may have been formalized by the renovation of the Lechaion  Road Basilica, embellished with an unusual sculpture program that included  heroes, gods, and personifications representing Peloponnesian member cities.  The relief figures could even have represented the itinerary of Hadrian’s first  visit as emperor to Greece in a.d. 124. The sculptures may have adorned the  Lechaion Road Basilica and offer a profile of the city and the Achaian koinon  just before the initiation of the Panhellenion in Athens. When Pausanias walked through the Roman Forum at Corinth, the relief  sculptures discussed here probably adorned one of the structures along his  way.1 While the scope for speculation is great, and the potential for certain  reconstruction is limited, this assemblage is valuable not only as additional  evidence of important Roman sculpture at Corinth, but also because it  expands our understanding of architectural sculpture in Roman Greece,  where relatively few large decorative programs survive. Several of these  installations were constructed at Corinth itself. They include the Julian  Basilica (ca. 27 b.c.–a.d. 54), located at the east end of the Forum, which  constituted a repository for portraits of Augustus, his adopted heirs Gaius  and Lucius, and other Julio-Claudians.2 The Propylaea (also known as the  1.

The precise identity of the marble images and the monument  they once adorned can only be hypothesized, but they attest to an ambitious  and well-executed sculptural program, and further illuminate artistic, and  perhaps historical, developments at Corinth. The assemblage includes relief  fragments excavated over the years in various areas of the Forum, plus some  chance finds on the site. Unfortunately, the findspots cannot be used as clues  to the panels’ original locations. All fragments with recorded contexts were  discovered in secondary contexts that reveal nothing about their original set- ting. One large fragment from 2 (S-1078), for example, was built into a 10th- century wall at the east end of the Forum near the Julian Basilica (Fig. 1).  The figure’s hand (S-744), however, was recovered during excavations  conducted in 1905 near the Babbius Monument at the opposite end of the  Forum. Other fragments were found southeast of Temple E, near the West  Shops, in the north and south central areas of the Forum, and in a marble  pile near the South Stoa; surface finds from Temple Hill and below its  northeast corner were also determined to belong to the same panel (Fig. 1). 3.

The features that associate them  as a specific sculptural program are discussed below. One frontal, nearly  life-sized human figure probably occupied each panel. None of the 12 as- sociated works is completely preserved. The group includes one specimen  on display in the Archaeological Museum at ancient Corinth, relief 1,  depicting a chlamys-draped man and seated dog. Dimensions A complete vertical dimension for the panels does not survive, but an esti- mated height of 1.745 m, based on restorations to 1, has been established.  In at least two cases the original width of the panel survives: 1 is 1.05 m  wide and 4 is 0.835 m wide. The thickness of the relief ground ranges  between 0.09 and 0.13 m, and the relief rises as much as 0.21 m above the  background. Plinth heights measure between 0.160 and 0.167 m; their  depth to the relief background varies from 0.130 to 0.135 m. Composition The panels themselves are flat, without carved moldings or raised borders.  The figures are not centered precisely on their relief grounds, and while  they are carved in high relief, they penetrate the background rather than  being “applied” to the surface. Among the 12 fragments presented here,  at least seven separate panels are identified (1–3, 5, 7, 9, 11), depicting  perhaps seven separate individuals, although some of these pieces conceiv- ably may be nonjoining fragments of the same slab.9 Considering all of the  fragments, 2, 3, and 9 are definitely female; 1 and 7 are male. The sex of  4, 5, 6, 8, and 10–12 is unknown, but it is possible that 4 and 5 are male  and 6, 8, 11, and 12 are female. Fragment 10 is a puzzle; since two of the  securely identified females are draped and shod, this barefoot personage  might be male. But it is also possible that the foot belongs to a female de- ity, as will be discussed below. Thus there are least three definite females,  four possible females, two definite males, and two more possible males.  Women may dominate the program, and this preponderance could be a  clue to its identity. The pieces have been identified as follows: 1 Draped male figure with dog 2 Upper half of draped female figure 3 Lower half of draped female figure 4 Lower portion of draped male(?) figure 9. This count of figures includes  5 Lower portion of draped male(?) figure with staff and snake  fragments that clearly cannot join with   (Asklepios?) each other.

Of those whose ponderation can be determined (1, 3, 4, 7–9),  all but one, 7 (and possibly 5), stand with their weight on the left leg. In  addition, at least four of them (1–4) turn to their left and are carved in  higher relief on the right side, while they recede into the background on  the left (Fig. 2). This orientation may eventually be useful in establishing  the arrangement of the panels on the monument they decorated. On the  other hand, the classicizing style of these reliefs, as discussed below, may  also have influenced the pose that their figures took. This stylistic approach  in part is responsible for the general orientation of the figures. But as we  shall see, the positioning of relief figures in other roughly contemporary  Roman sculptural assemblages appears to have been part of the overriding  Figure 2.

Photo Aileen Ajootian, courtesy of Working Details the American School of Classical Studies,  Corinth Excavations All the figures, both their skin and garments, were finished smoothly, with  some traces of fine rasp work still apparent. The backgrounds were treated  with a small-toothed claw chisel. Plinths (1, 3, 9, 10) display point work  with claw-chisel finish over it. The backs of all fragments were worked  roughly with the point. A very thin, drilled channel outlines the figures.  Panel 1 preserves the most working details; based on these features some  speculations are presented below about how the panels may have been  secured to a building. Few cuttings for attachment survive. The catalogue of the marbles is followed by a discussion of their style  and date. I will then consider the ancient architectural setting and meaning  of the sculptural program, as well as its possible patron. Catalogue 1 Draped male figure with dog Fig. 3 S-187/S-196/S-250.

The human figure lacks its head, both hands, left knee, and a section  of the garment behind his leg on his right side, together with adjoining portions of  the relief ground. The lower right portion of relief ground, including the youth’s right  hand and the plinth below, are broken away. A large wedge of the panel on the left  side, now missing, bore the figure’s head, his left hand and the top of the attribute  he holds, along with the top edge of the panel itself. The broken top diagonal edge  of the panel bears dark discoloration. The figure’s preserved height is 1.44 m, the  width of his shoulders is 0.46 m, the forearm is ca. 0.23 m. The restored height of  his head, roughly calculated as one-half the shoulder width, or as equivalent to the  forearm dimension, is ca. 0.23 m, yielding a preserved total height for the figure of  1.67 m, about life size. The ratio of head:body height is thus ca. 7.25:1. </page> <page sequence="7"> s imulacra  c iv itatum at  roman  cor inth 321 The youth stands at ease, resting his weight on his left leg; the left foot is  turned out slightly. A staff or spear on his left side helped support his weight. He  flexes his right leg, turning the right foot out slightly. Both feet are flat on the  ground. While the body recedes on the left side, the limited depth of the plinth  caused a compressed rendering of the feet, both extending out to its edge. The  figure’s right hand, now lost, was lowered and held slightly away from his side. He  presumably grasped the top of a staff or spear in his raised left hand. The bottom  of this attribute can be seen in low relief behind the dog sitting to the figure’s left.  To judge from the surviving muscles at the base of his neck on the right side, the  youth turned his head to his left. In fact, his whole body projects more from the  relief background on the right side than on the left, giving the impression that  although basically frontal, his attention is turned toward some point to his left, with  the weight leg receding into the relief ground. This leftward orientation might be  a clue to the placement of the slab, both on whatever monument it adorned, and  in relation to other figures in the series. The figure’s generally Polykleitan look, with clearly defined musculature and  chiastic pose, suggests that it was conceived in terms of an aggregate of classicizing  elements. The arrangement of the arms reflects that of the Doryphoros, but the  ponderation is reversed; this reorganization of pose had already been achieved by  the time of the Prima Porta Augustus, and suggests that Classical formulae could  be adapted for a specific composition. Most Polykleitan types rest their weight on  the right leg. The switch here may have been required by the orientation of the  figures to their left. The man fastened his chlamys with a small button over his right shoulder.  Draped in front and back, the right side of his body is exposed but the genitals  are concealed. The surviving front left end of the chlamys is rounded. Folds of  the garment are rendered as shallow and angular, descending from the fastening  of the garment as it drapes around the neck and over the front of the body. Over  the center of the torso gathered fabric falls in several layers; some of their lower  ends are now broken away. On the figure’s left side, the garment lies flatter, and a  wider series of shallow folds breaks up its surface. Over the upraised left arm, the  edge of the mantle folds back on itself, and long folds extend down its length. A  second system of V-shaped folds covers a broader expanse from just to the left of  the neck to the edge of the garment on its left side. The folds again are shallow;  one primary series moving down the garment is broken up by an intermediary  system of angular folds, nicks, and engraved lines. The back edge of the garment  is carved in low relief, running from midchest to midcalf. Rather than hanging  horizontally behind him, the mantle drapes diagonally across his back, ascending  toward the figure’s left side. Behind the right leg, the pointed corner of the chlamys  terminates in a weight. To the left of this personage sits a dog, now lacking the upper portion of his  body. With hindquarters on the ground, he faces away from the man. The dog’s  left paw extends to the right edge of the plinth, and his tail, carved in low relief,  rests on the plinth’s top surface. Coarse claw chisel marks are visible on the plinth’s  front, vertical surface. Its front edge was beveled, and the top surface roughly picked.  A drilled channel wider than the one delineating the man’s body on the relief  ground outlines his feet and the animal. Similar working details characterize 9,  a plinth fragment preserving a shod right foot. The treatment of the plinth suggests that the panel was elevated above eye  level, so that the rough details would not be visible. This panel also provides  some evidence for how the reliefs may have been attached to their monument.  10.

D-1967.0072 the Forum pavement, it could instead indicate where another member, possibly  a half column or pilaster, overlapped the panel on this side. The roughly picked  finish of the preserved left edge of the slab, without anathyrosis, supports such a  reconstruction. Lacking anathyrosis on its left side, the block was probably not  meant to fit tightly against another one. An added architectural frame may have  masked the joint between this relief and the next, presumably sculptured, block.  This left side of the relief lacks the lower section of both slab and plinth, so we  cannot determine if the plinth originally extended the full length of the relief. If  it did, then the base of the architectural border would have had to accommodate  this projection. The finished plinth edges of 9, however, extend the full length of  the panel. On the right side of the relief there is no corresponding discoloration. A small surviving area of the finished right edge reveals traces of anathyrosis.  The right side of the plinth also preserves a patch of anathyrosis. Because the dog’s  left front foot extends to the very edge of both the relief ground and the plinth,  an added architectural frame on this side must have touched the edge of the relief  without overlapping. Or, another sculptured block may have joined its neighbor  directly here, without an intervening element.

Photo courtesy Scala/  Art Resource, NY (ART 12815) from its master, toward the next panel, may have served as a visual link between  the two reliefs, perhaps connecting the personalities they depicted. The man’s attributes are numerous: dog, staff or spear, buttoned chlamys, even  his apparent youth and partial nudity are all clues to his identity, but they do not  reveal quite enough. Since he lacks a head, which could have been a portrait, the  right hand, which may have held an attribute, or an inscription, it is impossible  to know for sure whether we are dealing with a historical figure, hero, divinity, or  personification. There are possible candidates in all these categories. Stephanidou- Tiveriou compared this Corinth youth with a relief portrait in Rome of Antinoos  as Silvanus (Fig. 4) and other reliefs representing Herodes’ lovers as young heroes  after their deaths.11 The Antinoos/Silvanus and the Corinth man and dog reliefs  relate thematically to the Late Hadrianic or Early Antonine Spada reliefs in Rome  (Fig. 5). The original location of the Spada assemblage is unknown, but the panels  may have occupied niches in a domestic setting. These reliefs depict a variety of  11.

Athens, National Archaeological  Museum 4476. Photo courtesy National  Archaeological Museum, Athens in conception and composition from the Corinth work. In addition, nearly all the  young men in the Spada series are nude; they button the chlamys around their  shoulders and wear it draped behind them, so that it frames their bodies. In classical art, various male personages, divine and mortal, wear the chlamys  or mantle draped across the body, with only the sides exposed. One of the earli- est sculptural types wearing this garment, the so-called Phokion, represented by  Roman copies, is linked to an Early Classical original.14 In some Classical votive  reliefs, Hermes wears just a chlamys draped across his body. A group of Roman  statues cover their bodies with the chlamys, but without other attributes, it is  difficult to know for sure who they are. The garment in general symbolized the  world of the mythological hero and the mortal ephebe. It can be read as a symbol 14. Ridgway 1970, pp. 68–69,   of the Greek ephebic tradition, and this may be one of the meanings conveyed by pl. 113.  its use in Roman imagery.15 15. Hallett 2005, p. 29. 16.

The pose and costume of 1 draw on this background. Stance, chlamys, staff/ spear, and dog may indicate a hunter or a generally heroic personage.21 Is the youth  a mythological hero, such as the ones depicted in the Spada reliefs, or a local fig- ure, someone connected with the history of Corinth or Greece? Several similarly  elusive figures, young chlamys-draped men accompanied by dogs and sometimes  horses, adorn the south facade of the Augustan Sebasteion at Aphrodisias, with  its mythological scenes, imperial portraits, and regional personifications.22 These  figures have so far defied precise identification; Smith simply calls them “heroes.”23 2 Upper half of draped female figure Fig. 7 S-91/S-91a/S-744/S-1078.

Photo  courtesy Réunion des Musées Nationaux/ Art Resource, NY (ART 154091) For the disposition of the mantle and right hand held over the breast, Late  Classical sculpture types such as the Small Herculaneum woman, frequently repli- cated by Roman artists to depict both portraits and divinities, could have provided  the general inspiration (Fig. 9).28 But comparanda for the woman’s distinctive  gesture, index finger and pinkie extended, ring and middle fingers folded under the  palm, can be found in Roman settings. The gesture has various meanings, depend- ing on its context.29 Portraits of Roman women, private and imperial, provide the  most likely parallels.30 The Clodii family tombstone found in Frascate, for example,  includes busts of Hilaria, her husband, and son (Fig. 10),31 and has been dated  ca. Late Republic to Early Augustan.32 On the far right, Hilaria makes a gesture  similar to that of the figure in 2. She is clearly gripping the left edge of her palla  28.

To the right of the  figure are a few small areas of relief background. While the surface of the uppermost fragment is especially weathered, many  details of drapery survive. The woman wears two garments: a thick mantle, and  a lighter chiton beneath; both garments were finished lightly with the rasp. She  gathered enough of her mantle over her left arm, between her left arm and side,  or in her left hand, to raise it at a slant across the front of her body. About half of  the garment’s finished lower edge remains, from just above where the right ankle  would have been. One free edge and corner of the drapery terminates in a dress  weight on the figure’s left side. Shallow horizontal folds in the mantle are visible  near the waistline. Some of these folds and additional short, lightly carved folds  contour the side of her right thigh and lower leg. Long diagonal folds break up its  surface, running from the waist on the left side where the mantle was gathered,  to just above the missing right ankle. Beneath the mantle, an asymmetrical patch  of chiton can be seen that extends to midcalf height on her left side. Over the left  foot, the chiton folds back on itself, forming one-half of what looks like an omega  </page> <page sequence="17"> s imulacra  c iv itatum at  roman  cor inth 331 fold that probably was completed on the other side, but is now broken away. This  garment was summarily rendered in a series of thin vertical folds, irregularly spaced,  with squared top surfaces and deep, drilled valleys between them. Shallower nicks  in these folds provide subsidiary texturing. The sweep of the mantle diagonally  across the body suggests the figure held the ends up or tucked them between her  arm and side, similar to the pose of the Small Herculaneum woman (Fig. 9), who  pulls up the folds of her mantle, causing the lower edge to slant across the front  of her body.36 4 Lower portion of draped male(?) figure Fig. 12 S-3339: south end of West Shops (Corinth NB 217, p. 178); additional join  from marble pile in Northwest Shops.

Barzioti, courtesy of the Amer-  ican School of Classical Studies, Corinth  Excavations  Two joining fragments preserve the full original width of the panel. They  form the lower portion of a draped figure, on its right from midthigh level to the  knee, and on its left presumably to just above the ankle. Again the weight is on the left leg, the right drawn out to the side. Like most  of the other figures this one is in higher relief on its right side than on its left. It  was not centered on the panel, with ca. 0.22–0.23 m of relief ground on its right  and ca. 0.14–0.15 m to the left. Although weathered, long diagonal folds running  from the figure’s upper left side to its right knee (missing at the break) can be  seen. Along the figure’s left side, deeply drilled vertical folds delineate the ends  of the mantle and a curved edge of fabric that folds back on itself. This piece is  important because it is one of only two in this group (with 1) that preserves its  original width. At 0.835 m wide, this panel is some 0.20 m narrower. Its surviv- ing edges are finished roughly with anathyrosis. Either a very precise fit with the  front surface of the next block was not attempted, or a tight join was unnecessary,  since an overlapping architectural frame could have concealed it. It is not possible  to determine with certainty the sex of this personage. A comparison with 3 is  inconclusive because the leg is preserved above the ankle, where a chiton beneath  the mantle, or a garment touching the plinth, would indicate a female. The pre- served right leg on this fragment looks massive, due to the nature of the join, but  proportions do not help much either. 5 Lower portion of draped male(?) figure with staff  Fig. 13   and snake (Asklepios?) 36.

Barzioti, courtesy of the  American School of Classical Studies,  Corinth Excavations  Although the tops of some folds are broken away, it is still possible to see  that these surfaces were punctuated by shorter creases. The deep vertical folds of  the mantle contrast with shallower ones that cut diagonally across the arm, where  the fabric is not so thickly bunched. The figure appears to have bent her or his  left arm, possibly holding it across the body, or s/he may have stretched it forward  and down, to judge from the horizontal curved folds just at the elbow, where the  fragment is broken away. This piece resembles 2 in its proportions and treatment  of the drapery, and may pertain to a female. Vertical mantle folds gather at the neck  and descend over the shoulder and the front of the body on the left side, so the  figure may have worn her mantle the same way as 2, over both shoulders. Drilled  channels articulate the edges of the deeper folds. It is likely that this personage  turned slightly to her left, receding more deeply into the background on her left side. 7 Lower portion of partly draped male figure Fig. 16 S-2414/S-2479.

Along the right side of  the figure, small traces of the relief background remain. This figure rests his weight on his right leg and flexes his left. Of all the person- ages in the group whose pose can be determined, he alone rests his weight on the  right side. Thick mantle folds curve below the genitals, and begin to rise again on  his left side, as if the garment was held up or was draped over the left arm. Further  down on the right leg, several courses of deep folds cut diagonally across the body,  rising to the left. The fabric stretches over the bent left leg, contouring the knee. On  the outside of the left leg, vertical folds, their tops broken away, reflect the vertical  draping of the mantle ends on that side of the body. Diagonal folds cut across the  lower front of the garment. This pose determines the placement of the panel, but  also may provide clues to the identity of the personage represented.

Clinging drapery outlines the contour of the calf, with folds reflecting the  movement of a himation pulled diagonally across the front of the body and then  gathered over the left arm. It is impossible to determine the sex of this personage,  but it may be female, similar in pose and costume to 3.

One portion of the plinth preserves the front of a shod right foot (ca. 0.10 m  long) with the shoe and the remains of drapery over the foot and on each side.  The edges of the plinth are weathered, but its top edge survives. A section of the  lower central edge of the plinth is broken away. The original left edge of the plinth  preserves anathyrosis. The front vertical face of the plinth was finished with a claw  chisel, and the bearing surface was roughly dressed with the point. The front edge  of the block was beveled. The preserved length of the fragment is 0.565 m, which  is over half the length of the shorter panel’s width (4), and a little over half that of  the wider panel (1). Considerable blank space remains on the plinth to the left of  the foot. The foot, at a right angle to the length of the plinth, emerges from the  relief background, which survives to a height of only a few centimeters. The lower  end of the garment, draping over the instep and onto the plinth, indicates that this  figure is female. She wears a simple form of calcei muliebres, shoes that completely  cover the foot and are worn out of doors.43 Sculpted calcei were often detailed with  special straps and other features denoting official ranks for male administrators, 43. Goldman 1994, pp. 116–122,  though imperial females sometimes also wore elaborate forms.44 The fact that she esp. p. 116. is wearing this type of shoe may indicate that the statue represented some historical 44.

The resting surface and front of the plinth were finished with the  point. The figure’s ankle rises to a height of ca. 0.07 m with a small area of relief  ground. To the human figure’s right, the remains of a small cloven hoof (0.04 m  long), at an angle with the plinth, overlaps the juncture where it meets the relief  background. If the personage is female, she was nude or wore a short garment. The  figure could be identified as Artemis, who wears a short costume in both Classical  and later times, and is often accompanied by a deer or fawn. Or, the animal could  have been a goat, thus linking this fragment with 5, and supporting an identifica- tion of the figure as Dionysos.  11 Drapery fragment of female(?) figure with relief background Fig. 22 S-1995-4: found southeast of Temple E, built into a post-Frankish wall  (Corinth NB 879, p. 46).

The lower edge of the panel was finished with a fine claw chisel and preserves one- half of a cutting (ca. 0.04 x 0.04). To the right and left of the broken area on the  panel edge is a row of short uniform notches, possibly made with the bull-nosed  chisel. When the clamp on the back of the slab was removed, the area around it  was broken away. The drapery falls in thin, vertical folds whose edges turn over  on themselves and are broken up with nicks and dents. Along the left side of the  fragment, a few folds curve slightly over what might be the outside of the figure’s  left leg, just above the knee, where the edges of a mantle might fall free of the body. 12 Draped left shoulder(?) of female(?) figure Fig. 23 S-589: findspot unknown, excavated between 1896 and 1903.

The back of this fragment was worked  roughly with a point. Folds reacting to some movement or to the ending of a  limb are preserved on the surface of this fragment. The more deeply carved folds  are accented by incised lines echoing their path. It has been identified as part of  a draped upper left arm, but may make more sense, however, if rotated clockwise  180°, with folds looped down rather than arching up; in this orientation it would  represent part of the abdomen of the figure. The sex is unknown but just possibly  the figure could be female.  Style and Date The poses and classicizing drapery of 1 and 2 convinced early commentators  that these works were grave monuments of the 4th century b.c.46 Actually,  one-to-one correspondences with recognizable classical types are difficult to  establish, but reflections of classical Greek style, what Kousser calls Roman  “retrospective” art,47 are expressed in the clothing worn by the figures (chla- mys, chiton, himation), as well as by their attributes, poses, and the way their  Figure 23.

As mentioned, the running drill was used unobtrusively. Thin, drilled  lines articulate the figures, and on the plinths of 1, 9, and 10, a thicker groove  was drilled around the human figures’ feet. The drill was also employed  to carve deep channels between the drapery folds. Crisply defined nicks  and creases along the rounded edges of the folds break up the regularity  of these furrows. Drill work is most evident in the chiton of 3, where the  light texture of the garment was expressed by a series of summarily carved  vertical folds with angular tops. On panel 2, the drill articulated strands  of hair pulled back from the forehead. But nowhere was the drill used for  dramatic chiaroscuro effects. Turning to the drapery, several common stylistic traits can be observed.  Garments appear taut at the edges of the figures as they emerge from the  relief ground, with shallow folds starting just inside the edges of the forms,  rather than at the point where the sculpture rises from the background. In  general, folds are linear and angular. Short, scored lines often break up the  surface of the valleys between folds (1–3). The chlamys of 1 is organized in  a system of flattened, schematic V-shaped folds with broad, smooth planes  between them. The formal, patterned quality of the carving is especially  evident in the treatment of garment edges, where the cloth folds over on  itself. The chlamys edges of 1, for example, turn back on both the right  and left sides forming flat, stylized double folds, especially over the left  arm. Most mantles display the same flattened treatment at their edges.  Short, shallow folds break up the surfaces along the sides of the figures.  Characteristically, pairs of opposing folds appear at knees and hips (3, 8).  Fragment 7 is exceptional in the plastic modeling of its drapery, which is  apparent in the swag of folds draped across the thighs.

These compositions, which are  full of movement with their overlapping figures presented in three-quarters  perspective, provide parallels for elements found in the pieces presented  here, such as the contrasts in the textures of the figures’ drapery. For instance  in 1, a thin layer of fabric broken up by shallow, angular folds appears in  the same garment as deeply carved clusters of folds. Outside Rome, figures on the reliefs adorning the Arch of Trajan at  Benevento (a.d. 109–114) wear drapery whose planes are rendered in thin  sheets, with shallow, incised folds breaking up their surfaces (Fig. 24).48  Connections in style and composition have been noticed between this  structure and others in the Roman world, including the Philoppapos  Monument in Athens, which was probably constructed between a.d. 113  and 116 (Fig. 25).49 This multilevel grave monument was adorned with  sculptures of the Commagenian ruler and his family, both in the round  and in high relief. Local Athenian sculptors executed an unusual plan  for Philopappos’s tomb, but stylistically the sculpture reflects a regional  tradition. The rendering of the figures’ drapery, with flat sections framed  by angular folds, provides good parallels for the Corinth reliefs discussed  here. It is possible that the Philopappos Monument in Athens and the  reliefs in Corinth are roughly contemporary. Furthermore, there appear to 48.

In front of  him is an altar and behind him stands a dog. The Corinth panel, possibly  depicting one of Herodes’ other companions, would thus have been cre- ated some time after a.d. 130, when Antinoos died. In fact, Stephanidou-  Tiveriou places Corinth panel 1 in the third quarter of the 2nd cen- tury, arguing that the Antinoos/Silvanus relief could have served as  a model.52 The overarching classicizing theme of both works imparts critical  meaning and there are important similarities: a single, youthful male, a  quiet pose, classical costume, the dog an attribute of a hunter. Both panels  are large; at 1.43 x 0.63 m the relief from Lanuvium is a bit smaller than  the one in Corinth.53 But while they share thematic elements, it is still  possible to find differences, for example, in the rendering of the drapery,  that might suggest alternate dates. As noted, low, angular, rather schematic  folds distinguish the drapery of 1 and most of the other related Corinthian  reliefs. There is a more plastic quality to the organization of the exomis’s  surface in the Antinoos/Silvanus relief. The folds are in higher relief and  less patterned, not so sharply defined. Thematic similarities between the  Corinth panel and reliefs heroizing or divinizing Antinoos and other  comrades of Herodes Atticus are clear; they all compelled viewers to see  the subjects in a classical context. On the other hand, the figure of the  Antinoos/Silvanus relief carried many attributes, and the bucolic setting  created by the grape vine growing in the upper left corner of the panel  contributed to its meaning. In contrast, the background of the Corinth  man and dog panel is blank; there is no landscape or vegetation, unless  such details were painted. In fact, no carved background details survive in  the assemblage discussed here. Furthermore, the panel has been treated as a singleton. It must now  be considered as one of a group of reliefs sharing certain stylistic and  other details such as the prevalence of its classical vocabulary. Since panel  1 is part of a program, it may be less likely that the youth portrayed one  of Herodes Atticus’s heroized comrades, even though he and the Banca  Romana Antinoos may very well have been inspired by some of the same  general thematic and stylistic sources. Returning finally to the question of  date, based on the comparanda discussed above, we can assign the Corinth  reliefs presented here to the Early Hadrianic period. 51.

The Antinoos/Silvanus relief is notable because the sculptor’s name is  inscribed on the altar—Antoninianus of Aphrodisias. It belongs to a long  and well-documented tradition of sculptors and sculpture workshops at  Aphrodisias.54 In contrast, at Corinth, the activities of Roman sculptors,  local or otherwise, are not well understood. Sturgeon has shown that at  least one Athenian artist, Theodotos, was at work on some aspect of the  Hadrianic theater sculptures at Corinth.55 Sculpture workshops at Corinth  have not yet surfaced, although much unfinished work has been found. It  is difficult to isolate a stylistic vocabulary characteristic of Corinth alone.  Sturgeon identified a generally Attic style in use for the Hadrianic theater  sculptures.56 Relief figures from the centauromachy, Amazonomachy, and  mythological friezes are outlined with a deep, drilled channel. The back- grounds are finished with the claw chisel, similar to the reliefs discussed in  this article, but the tool marks are bigger and deeper. The programs may be  contemporary, and thus it would seem that different sculptural approaches  coexisted at Corinth. The architectural sculptures presented here should also now be  considered in the context of 2nd-century Athenian high-relief sculpture  provided by Despinis.57 He assigns fragmentary relief panels to a variety of  Hadrianic monuments in Athens, including the Bema of Phaedros at the  Theater of Dionysos, and the so-called Hadrianic Basilica in the Agora. The  works involve a wide variety of themes and poses with action groupings,  many nude males, recognizable divinities, and peplophoroi. Approximately  0.9–0.95 m tall, the figures are smaller than those on the Corinth panels.  In style, theme, and scale the Athenian works do not appear to be close  matches for the Corinth panels, but they are similar in working details,  especially in the treatment of the plinths. The numerous public building  projects under way across the Forum may have demanded a large force of  stonemasons and sculptors, perhaps including, or led by, teams from Athens. THE ARCHITECTURAL FORMAT:   “COLUMN-AND-SCREEN” CONSTRUCTION Discovering a common theme for these reliefs depends not only on deci- phering the meaning of their style and attributes, but also on understanding  the broader issues of their format and possible setting. Evidence for the  attachment of the panels in an architectural setting is slim, and no related  architectural elements have yet been identified, but a few points can be  reiterated. To judge from the relatively well-preserved surfaces of some  panels, they may have been shielded from rain and wind by a projecting  cornice, or possibly they were inside a building. If the slabs adorned the  54. See Smith 2011; Van Voorhis exterior of a building they may not have been up for very long. The roughly  2012. finished reverses suggest that the panels veneered a wall or were set up so  55. Corinth IX.3, p. 22. 56. Corinth IX.3, p. 26; see also their backs could not be seen. The plinths’ coarse finish on top (1, 3, 9, 10)  Sturgeon 1989; Palagia 2010, p. 434. also supports the possibility that they had an elevated prospect that would  57. Despinis 2003; Sturgeon 2004. have concealed this treatment. Surviving anathyrosis is sketchy, suggesting  </page> <page sequence="30"> 344 a ileen  a joot ian that tight bonds with other elements were not a concern. The discoloration  along the left side of 1 may indicate that a separate architectural feature, a  half-column or pilaster, overlapped it. There is no room for a similar overlap  on the right side of this panel, which bears traces of coarse anathyrosis on  its edge. Another sculpted panel with a similar finish may have touched  it, or the two pieces may have been joined by an architectural element of  some kind. So-called column-and-screen construction—alternating panels with  single figures in relief, framed by columns—was employed on numerous  Hellenistic and Roman civic monuments in Italy and Asia Minor, and can  be traced back to at least as early as the mid-2nd-century b.c. altar in the  sanctuary of Athena at Priene.58 Reviewing some of the Roman examples  of this architectural system suggests that our Corinth panels were also  constructed in the column-and-screen format, which may provide some  clues to the figures’ identities. A variant of the column-and-screen plan was used in the Porta Marzia  in Perugia (ca. second half of the 2nd century b.c.). The illusionistic frieze  of figures between columns, looking over a balustrade that conceals the  lower half of their bodies, fills the space above the arched opening of the  gate. The figures are identified as Zeus and the Dioskouroi, with the twins’  horses flanking the central trio.59 A more canonical presentation of full figures on relief panels is pre-  served on the so-called Memmius monument at Ephesos.60 Gaius Mem-  mius, grandson of the Roman general Sulla, was consul suffectus in Rome,  ca. 34 b.c. A date in the 30s of the 1st century b.c. has been upheld for  this monument, the function of which, however, remains unclear.61 It is 58.

The panels on the south side present Greek myth  and scenes of imperial conquest involving action groups. The north portico,  with its single-figure personification reliefs (Fig. 27), pertains directly to  our investigation, while the sculptural program as a whole sheds light on  the meaning of the Corinth assemblage.68 Few sculptures survive from the uppermost register of the north portico,  but two personified entities, Day and Ocean, have been recovered; both of  these female figures are identified by the inscribed bases upon which the  reliefs once rested.69 Below this cosmic level, the middle tier of the north  portico bore personifications of territories and ethne, peoples of the empire,  represented as standing female statues on engaged bases, one figure per  slab, between Ionic half-columns. These figures were sculptured in high  relief on the surface of their flat, blank backgrounds, and are occasionally  68. For the north portico of the 2.87 m (Smith 1988, p. 61).

All except one probably held additional  objects that once helped to identify them. The figured panels were sup- ported by separate, lower panels with bases in relief, like a row of statues  between columns.70 The Sebasteion personifications, feminized images of  Roman territories and peoples, are not abject or subjugated; rather, they  stand at ease on their bases. Yet across the precinct on the south side, one  of the imperial panels depicts Claudius as a youthful hero vanquishing  Britannia, a collapsing woman with breast bared and hair in disarray.71 In  another scene, Nero, similarly posed, overcomes a nude female Armenia.72  Thus, the potential for imperial violence against peoples and provinces,  represented as women, was expressed in the Sebasteion program.73 Originally, labels inscribed on the separate bases identified the personi- fied tribes and provinces, but so far, just one sculptured ethnos, the Pirusti,  an Illyrian tribe, has been reunited with its base.74 Smith interpreted  the topographical sequence of the north portico as a visual catalogue of  Augustan territorial presence, representing the diversity and extent of  Roman control, an anthropomorphic map of the empire and its local  peoples. He suggested that some of the images may have appeared exotic  and unfamiliar to ancient viewers, and that the identifying inscriptions were  essential elements of the composition.75 The inscribed names could thus  be considered collectively as an inventory of imperial regions and peoples,  many ethnic groups united in their diversity. The south portico of the Sebasteion at Aphrodisias focused not only  on scenes of imperium but also on representations of Greek myths. Smith  sees the use of recognizable Greek heroes like Herakles and a classiciz- ing style as a way of linking Roman power with classical tradition. He  further contends that this iconography may symbolize Greece’s place in  the empire not as a subjugated nation but as the cultural inspiration of the  Julio-Claudian rulers.76 The Sebasteion at Aphrodisias derived its inspira- tion from a well-established iconography representing personified imperial  toponyms. The Sebasteion personifications, while they probably included  some new combinations of costume and attributes, reflect established  visualizations of extended imperial control in Rome and Italy.77 Pompey,  for example, adorned the cavea of his theater in the Campus Martius with  14 figures of peoples he had conquered.78 Augustus’s Portico ad Nationes  was adorned with personified nations sculpted by the artist Coponius.79  The fragmentary reliefs adorning the altar of the Ara Pacis include draped  70.

The frontal draped and helmeted female (ART 77076) supporting a shield has traditionally been considered to represent Minerva,  an appropriate figure in this context considering the presence of her temple  below and her ancestral role in Nerva’s family. But Sturgeon, followed by  Wiegartz, has convincingly proposed that this martial figure, which closely  resembles the personified Pirusti from the north portico of the Sebasteion  at Aphrodisias, is not a god but an ethnos, and that all the attic reliefs of  the Forum Transitorium depicted conquered peoples, tribes, or nations.83 The Province reliefs from the Hadrianeum in Rome, constructed by  Antoninus Pius ca. a.d. 145, should be included in this survey, even though  the massive blocks featuring single relief figures do not conform to the  column-and-screen format discussed above (Fig. 29).

Like the Sebasteion  personifications, the character of each province in the Hadrianeum series  was clearly defined by costume and attributes, although no inscribed labels  have been recovered. Some tentative identifications have been made, but  most of the figures, with their distinctly non-Roman dress, hairstyles, shoes,  and headgear, remain nameless. Also, like the Sebasteion personifications,  they are not abject or captive, but stand at ease, hands unfettered, as peaceful  members of the empire following the Greek tradition of territorial represen- tations, rather than as gentes devictae in the Roman manner.86 This survey of single-figure relief panels in architectural settings includes  a private funeral monument, at least two Roman enclosures for sanctuar- ies, a triumphal arch, and a temple.87 The Sebasteion panels, the Forum  Transitorium attic sculpture, and the Province reliefs from the Hadrianeum  in Rome are the closest in compositional terms to the Corinth panels, with  their static, frontal figures in large scale on a relief ground. The Sebasteion  personifications create the illusion of statues in the round on inscribed bases.  The Minerva/province in the attic course of the Forum Transitorium was  applied frontally to the background, with no torsion. The Hadrianeum figures  project in high relief from a flat background, as they are given an additional  architectonic quality by the cornices that frame the figures top and bottom, as  if they were standing in front of a podium. The relief ground of the Corinth  panels is more yielding; the figures penetrate it, and though they are frontal,  they turn slightly and recede, usually to their left, into the background. Moving from the formal and compositional details to the themes of  these programs, it seems that the single-figure format was employed for a  specific iconographic purpose, to create visual lists showcasing the diver- sity of the empire, which had been unified by Roman power. Of all these  programs, only the Sebasteion’s north portico emphasizes ethnic variety  in the empire, with each group symbolized by a single representative, as  well as the Roman military domination that kept it under control, which  was expressed by two-figure vignettes. The other monuments documented  the orderly cooperation of conquered peoples across the Mediterranean.  The interaction of the architectural format with the distinctive ideological  expression of Roman dominion and provincial cooperation became a stan- dard way of visually expressing this complex relationship across the empire. 85.

The Corinth person- ages do not project a military theme; there are no soldiers, and probably  no imperial personages like those restored on the Propylaea. Nor are the  figures depicted as subjugated enemies, like the colossal barbarians of the  Captives’ Facade. Men and women are represented, but there are probably  more females. The figures of reliefs 5, 7, and 10 could be gods. All are dis- tinguished by classical poses, drapery, and attributes, as well as a notable  lack of surviving “foreign” attributes, garments, and hairstyles. The designers  drew deliberately on classical Greek artistic vocabulary, which itself should  be considered an attribute and a vehicle for meaning. The standing, frontal figures presented above as parallels for the  Corinth panels have all been identified as gods, personifications, or, in the  case of the Memmius monument, a heroized mortal.88 In Early Roman  narrative reliefs, frontal figures generally represent images of gods, con- trasting with the three-quarter or profile poses of the mortals. Later the  emperor also began to appear frontally.89 In the Roman single-figure for- mat surveyed here, frontality appears to have been employed for specific  entities, notably personifications or gods. The frontal Corinth figures can  profitably be studied in this general context; they may depict personifica- tions, gods, or heroes. If the Corinth figures are personifications, what  “corporate” units,90 provinces, regions, or cities, did they depict? Set up in  an important colony in Achaia, the sculptures may represent cities or regions  of the province, making it one of the few such programs recovered so far  in Greece. The male members of the group, whoever they are, probably  do not represent Roman provinces, which in other contexts are exclusively  depicted as women,91 and they may not be personifications at all. Relief 1  could be a youthful hero representing his region or city. Reliefs 5, 7, and  10, possibly gods, could be standing in for their respective hometowns.  The draped personages, some clearly females, like 2 and 3, and the other  probable women inspired by Greek models, lent their classicizing cachet  to personifications of Greek cities.92 The practice of feminizing political abstractions and civic entities was  a venerable Greek iconographic tradition.

She was probably shaking hands with Athena or another god.93 Another  record relief fragment preserves the inscribed name Salamis, probably the  island, which identifies a figure that also appears to have been female.94  In 5th-century Attic vase painting, there is more evidence for Greek top- onyms represented as women. Makron’s skyphos in London (ca. 480 b.c.)  presents Eleusis, labeled with an inscription, personified as a draped  woman.95 Epidauros, also identified by inscription, appears as a draped,  veiled woman holding the baby Asklepios on a late-5th-century plate by  the Meidias Painter.96 Many monuments in Rome and the empire were adorned with personi- fications of nationes et civitates, the tribes and peoples within provinces.97  The groups can be very broad in scope, like the program at Aphrodisias,  encompassing the denizens of the Roman world, but some focused more  narrowly on tribes, peoples, or cities located in specific provinces. According  to Strabo (4.3.2 [C 192]), an altar located in a sanctuary for Augustus at  Lugdunum (Lyon), was inscribed with the names of approximately 64  Celtic peoples, and included statues representing each tribe.98 The Julio- Claudian monument of the Etruscans at Cerveteri, probably the relief  screen of an altar, preserves figures identified by their inscriptions as vari- ous Etruscan cities.99 A base from Pozzuoli, now in Naples, is thought to  copy the sculptured support of a colossal portrait of Tiberius depicted on a  sestertius (a.d. 22–23) bearing the legend CIVITATIBUS ASIAE RESTITUTIS  93.

It was an important  center of commerce and banking.104 Smaller regional alliances within  Roman Achaia are attested by inscriptions—Boiotian, Lokrian, Phokian,  and Dorian—but by the first half of the 2nd century a.d., the large, post- 146 b.c. Achaian League included most of the Peloponnese.105 Corinth  appears to have been the dominant seat for an imperial cult associated with  the League, as attested by an Argive protest, discussed below, concerning  payments for a celebration at Corinth. THE CORINTH RELIEFS AND THE ROMAN  ACHAIAN LEAGUE IG IV 1605, a Greek inscription excavated at Corinth, provides an intrigu- ing glimpse of the apparent interaction between Corinth and other main- land cities, probably during the a.d. 120s (Fig. 30).106 The stone was found  near the Kapodistrias School, just east of the Apollo Temple, on March 5,  1899. The entry in Corinth VIII.1 for this stone included only a line  drawing and brief description, so a few additional notes are provided  here. The text, a fragmentary list of Greek cities, is preserved on the  lower left corner of a panel of white marble streaked with gray. With a  preserved height of 0.24 m, the fragment measures 0.25 m in length, and  is ca. 0.05 m thick. Its back was smoothly worked, with a beveled band  ca. 0.04 m wide along the right side. The finished left edge measures  0.025 m wide. On the bottom, the text respects a 0.04 m margin within  the raised border. The letters are not uniform in height or width, vary- ing between ca. 0.015 to 0.035 m in height for rho and phi, with lunate  sigmas, epsilons, and omegas. The Corinth fragment preserves six place-names: Leuktron, Korone,  Kephallenia, Boiai, Klitor, and Messene. The rubric ετ appears after each of  the last three names, the letters cut vertically, ε above τ, a uniform 0.14 m  in from the stone’s raised left border. This notation was interpreted by  Spawforth as an abbreviation for the word ἐτ(έλεσε), “paid.”107 The stone  also preserves alphabetic numerals, stigma (90) and qoppa (6), following  ετ in each of the last two lines. These entries have defied satisfactory in- terpretation. If they record payments, Spawforth pointed out, it is difficult  to explain the discrepancy in the amounts, or what units the numerals  represent. On the other hand, if they are financial contributions of some  kind, the different quantities might be explained by the respective size and  importance of the cities that produced them. 104.

His interpretation of the  numismatic evidence has found general acceptance, although questions  remain about the activities of the Achaian League in the 1st century b.c.–1st  century a.d. Spawforth contends that member cities funded events held in  honor of the imperial cult established in Corinth by the Achaian League ca.  a.d. 54, when Nero became emperor.116 Evidence for League involvement  in the imperial cult located at Corinth begins by at least ca. a.d. 54–59  and can be traced into the 3rd century.117 Thus this political collective can  be shown to have embraced many Peloponnesian cities, including those  named on the Corinth and Argos inscriptions, and to have focused its at- tention on Corinth by the 1st century a.d. Returning to the Corinth inscription and its Argive counterpart, it is  possible, according to Spawforth, that their purpose was to record how much  115. Boehringer 1991; Warren 1991; 116.

The inscriptions may also illuminate a letter  erroneously attributed to the 4th-century emperor Julian. The letter formerly  ascribed to Julian should now date to between a.d. 80 and 120.119 Written  probably to the governor of Achaia by a Roman official representing Argos,120  it documented that city’s quarrel with Corinth over the payment for the  production of venationes associated with imperial cult at the colony.121 As for the inscriptions, some of the place-names support a date dur- ing the earlier period of Hadrian’s reign. The Arcadian city Mantineia,  for example, underwent a name change at the time of the emperor’s  Peloponnesian tour in a.d. 124. According to Pausanias, Hadrian ordered  the place-name Antigoneia, which was instituted in 222 b.c. to honor the  Macedonian regent Antigonos II Doson, to be dropped, and for the city’s  Greek identity to be restored.122 So the list as it appears in the inscriptions  must date to some time after this change, but perhaps not long after. In  addition, Messenian Korone, the site of the best harbor on the Messenian  Gulf, was one of two landmasses Hadrian awarded to Sparta, also in  a.d. 124.123 Finally, the island Kephallenia was an Achaian possession until  reassigned to the province Epiros, no later than the mid-2nd century a.d.124 The dating of the inscribed texts based on their content, therefore,  coincides with the date assigned to the reliefs discussed in this article,  ca. a.d. 120s. I have proposed above that the sculptures belonged to a pro- gram of personifications perhaps visualizing cities of Achaia. Is it possible  that the sculpted figures are personified representatives of at least some of  the likely Achaian League cities named on the Corinth and Argos stones?  Also, was the Corinth inscription IG IV 1605 itself part of the monument,  perhaps providing a guide to the identification of the personified cities, or  a reckoning of how certain Peloponnesian cities supported construction  of the sculptures and their architectural setting?125 At the very least, the Argos and Corinth texts together name 15  Achaian League members that could have been depicted in monumental  sculpted form—personifications or mythological luminaries representing  their cities. Corinth and Argos, two likely additions, increase the number  to 17.126 Although the Corinth inscription preserves the end of the list, it  lacks the top of the stone and the beginning of the text, so we do not know  118.

And originally, the inscription may have  contained more than one column, thus naming even more sites. If it is possible to associate the inscribed city lists with members of  the Achaian League, the specific sites named may provide additional clues  concerning the occasion of the inscription. The presence of the island  Kephallenia in the catalogue, since its four main cities are not actually  attested as Achaian League members, may actually point toward the cor- rect interpretation of the text, and, most importantly, of the relief figures  discussed in this article.127 According to Cassius Dio (69.16.2), Hadrian  directed all revenues from Kephallenia to Athens. Boatwright asserts,  however, that Dio may have overstated the case, and that while the island  submitted some funds to Athens, other evidence suggests that it remained  autonomous, though linked with Achaia.128 There may be another reason  why this island, and the other sites, appeared on the inscribed lists. In addition to being in the Peloponnese and possible koinon members,  several of these places received imperial visits and even benefactions from  Hadrian during his Peloponnesian travels in the autumn of a.d. 124 and  early 125. Pausanias, the Historia Augusta, and inscriptions reveal that late  in 124 he visited the following cities in this order: Megara, Epidauros,  Troizen, Hermione, and Argos.129 Early the next year the emperor toured  Mantineia, Tegea, Sparta, Corinth, Athens, Thespiae, Korone, Abai,  Hyampolis, Delphi, and Dyrrhachium before heading back to Rome. For  at least six of the cities on the inscribed lists there is literary or epigraphi- cal evidence for Hadrian having visited them: Lakedaimon, Epidauros, 127. Spawforth 1994a, p. 226.

At Sparta, epigraphical evidence for imperial permission to buy grain from  Egypt may coincide with the aftermath of Hadrian’s first visit and the need  to recoup food supplies depleted by a dramatically increased population.133 The order of the list on the Corinth and Argos inscriptions does  not conform to the sequence of Hadrian’s first imperial tour of Greece,  except for one leg of the journey in a.d. 124. Three cities in the Argolid— Epidauros, Troizen, and Hermione—appear in the same sequence in both  of the inscriptions and the documented imperial route. Thus, while the  inscriptions do not constitute a true itinerarium, or a list of stops along a  specific ancient route, they may reflect such a document.134 Also, not all  the cities on the Corinth and Argos inscriptions appear in the literary or  epigraphical record concerning the emperor’s tour: Mothone, Patrai, Elis,  Zakynthos, Leuktron, Kephallenia, Boiai, and Kleitor are missing. It is  just possible that the inscribed city list provides hitherto unrecognized  information about Hadrian’s first Greek journey. In a.d. 125, for example,  on his way to Corinth, he might well have stopped at Patrai, an important  banking center for Achaia, and an Augustan colony—he had just adopted  the title Augustus. As for Elis, critics have speculated that even though no  specific information survives concerning an imperial stop at Olympia, there  must have been one.135 The inscribed lists, which name Elis, thus may yield  evidence for Hadrian’s visit to the oldest Panhellenic site, the home of Zeus,  who was about to become the focus of the emperor’s Panhellenion strategy.  On his way back to Italy in a.d. 125, the emperor visited Delphi and other  133.

Thus the fusion of Latin imperium  and Greek inheritance, critical for membership in the Panhellenion League,  was expressed visually by the text on this stone. Just possibly, this singleton  supported a personified dedicant city, rather than an imperial portrait. In  any case, there is evidence for the visual reckoning of Panhellenion members  at the Olympieion precinct. The residents of Olympia dedicated many  portraits of Hadrian, plus, it seems, their own sculpted images.143 The  earlier ensemble of Achaian League images proposed for Corinth would  then precede the broader Panhellenion program at the Olympieion. Thus  the possible re-creation of Hadrian’s Peloponnesian tour at Corinth and  the abundant statuary at the Olympieion precinct can be viewed as part  of a larger programmatic effort to visualize the empire and the emperor’s  travels through it, by which his power was inscribed on the oikumene by  means of benefactions and his very presence. It is now time to see if there is any iconographical evidence that might  link Hadrian’s Peloponnesian destinations with the Corinth sculptures.  It will not be possible here to identify each piece securely with a specific  site. If the sculptural program at Corinth depicted Achaian cities, then its  designers employed an existing stylistic vocabulary to represent places not  widely depicted in the art of their day. Thus there may have been some  flexibility in the way the topographical entities were displayed, either as  personified images of the places themselves, or by means of representative 142.

Ovid, for instance, developed Kephalos and Prokris as  individuals deceived by their own mistaken perceptions, which resulted  in tragic loss.151 The ability to claim a Classical founder, which was critical for member- ship in the Panhellenion, as we shall see, may already have been important  for members of the Achaian League, so it would have been Kephalos’s  venerable connection with his island that was important and exploited  visually. Relief 1 may thus represent the hero Kephalos, characterized by  magical attributes, his spear and dog. His exploits take place across the  Peloponnese, making him an appropriate figure for a sculptural program  representing members of the Achaian League. Like Hadrian, Kephalos had  traveled across the Peloponnese. Kephalos was part of a very old Greek  mythological tradition, and this is emphasized in the Corinth sculpture by  the classicizing costume and pose. As the eponymous hero of Kephallenia,  he symbolizes his island not as a personification, but as its founder. The  hero, a suitable representative of Kephallenia in a program representing  “old Greek” entities, is a forerunner of the heroes who lent their Greek  identities to later eastern city members of Hadrian’s Panhellenion.152 Thus  his pose and attire on the Corinth man-and-dog relief connected him with  an earlier Greek tradition of gods and heroes. As we have seen, Hadrian’s completion and dedication of the temple  and precinct of Olympian Zeus in Athens were linked with the initiation  of the Panhellenion League in a.d. 131/2.153 An organization designed to  unify some of the Aegean provinces, with Athens as its centerpiece, the  Panhellenion included three mainland provinces, Achaia, Macedonia, and  Thrace, as well as the partly African Cyrene/Crete, and just one eastern  member, Asia. This political body embraced Greek urbes that could docu- ment their connection with “old Greek” mother cities on the mainland, or 151.

Photos courtesy Trustees of the  British Museum but also to its diplomatic relationships with other ancient sites in Asia  Minor.159 We shall return briefly to this monument below. The choice of the ancestor-hero Kephalos to represent his island sug-  gests that the conceptual foundation of the Corinth program drew on a tradi-  tion of myth and iconography to create common ground for cities whose  individual identities and local interests sometimes created strife among  them, as attested by the pseudo-Julian letter discussed above. The superfi- cial appearance of unity among Greek cities vying for recognition of their  individual traditions and the emperor’s attention could have been beneficial  both for the poleis and their Roman administrators. Yet other bonds may  have been shared by at least some of the cities on the inscribed lists found at  Argos and Corinth. A rare bronze Imperial coin minted at Corinth possibly  during Hadrian’s second visit (ca. a.d. 126/7) illuminates relations between  Corinth and Patrai at that time (Fig. 33), and perhaps also their special status  as colonies. The badly worn obverse bears the emperor’s portrait. On the  reverse stand two draped women, possibly wearing turret crowns, who flank  an altar and gesture toward it with their right hands. The legend CONCORD  CORINT ET PATR, “concord between Corinth and Patrai,” identifies the  figures as Corinth and Patrai, with the altar of Concord between them.160  The scene commemorates the cities’ good relationship, but also their status.  Corinth and Patrai stand out as Roman colonies, Caesarean and Augustan,  respectively, among other koinon members on the inscribed lists. Thus we  might look for images of Corinth and Patrai among the fragmentary draped  females in the sculpture group (2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12). 159. Yıldırım 2004, p. 24. no. 1, s.v. Korinthos [C.

Bronze Corinthian coin reverses depicted Arte-  mis Laphria, the goddess transplanted from Kalydon to Roman Patrai, to-  gether with Aphrodite Hoplismene, whose temple was on Acrocorinth.161  So perhaps Patrai, as in the later coinage, was represented by Artemis La-  phria herself, in which case, 10, a plinth fragment with a bare right foot  and small cloven hoof on top, could be associated with this Achaian colony. Greek Imperial coins provide evidence for visualizations of some of  the other cities discussed here. Argos was represented as a standing draped  woman with a turret crown, holding a patera and cornucopia (Lucius  Verus, a.d. 161/2).162 On the reverses of coins from Troizen and Messene  the cities were represented as women, who generally wore turret crowns  and sometimes veils.163 Such visualizations were also found on mosaics,  e.g., Lakedaimonia, identified with a label, appears as the bust of a draped  woman on a 4th-century a.d. mosaic from Bath E at Antioch.164 Epidauros, an early stop along Hadrian’s route in a.d. 124, dedicated a  statue to Hadrian, its “savior and benefactor,” though the nature of his gifts  is not known.165 After a long period of neglect, Epidauros and the sanctuary  of Asklepios were receiving imperial attention. The local sacred calendar  was revised, with a.d. 124 as the first year of the new era; the same thing 161.

The dating of this two-story structure,  embellished with colossal sculpted barbarian captives, is controversial.173  It is traditionally assigned a date between the 130s and the 170s a.d., but  Ridgway argued for it being a Severan construction. Schneider challenged  this chronology, redating the structure to the late 2nd century a.d. Recently  Despinis pushed it back even further, into the 140s. Strocka has added an  additional layer of controversy by suggesting that the Captives’ Facade was  a Neronian installation.174 The pavement of the Roman Forum at Corinth presents many  stratigraphic problems. According to Scranton, the marble paving still  visible today in the lower Forum dates to the late 1st–early 2nd century  a.d., before the construction of the Captives’ Facade. This pavement was  installed after the Bema was in place, to judge from cuttings made in its  facade to accommodate the marble slabs, and it also postdated the Central  and Northwestern Shops, according to Scranton.175 Hill, excavator of two  fragments of 1 and the Captives’ Facade coffer fragment S-195, noted the  latter was found “just at the level of the pavement, five meters west of the  tall martyra.”176 If the coffer block belongs to the Captives’ Facade, then both  it and the structure adorned with the reliefs discussed here must have been  out of use when the pavement was laid down. In fact, from Hill’s report,  the pavement he was investigating at this point appears to have gone over  the remains of the Captives’ Facade itself. Despite the contiguous position  of the relief and coffer fragments with the Roman marble pavement as  reported by Hill, it is likely that they were reused as replacement paving  stones some time after their buildings were damaged or dismantled. As stated above, findspots are not reliable guides to the original place- ment of sculpture at ancient Corinth. But some of the relief fragments  under discussion were found on the eastern side of the excavated Forum.  While the plan and date of the Captives’ Facade have not been resolved, the  panels discussed here are probably too early stylistically for this monument.  On the other hand, the Trajanic phase of the Propylaea’s arch crowning  the Lechaion Road, against which the later Captives’ Facade abutted, was  probably not the setting for these sculptures either.177 The arch had at  least two phases. The original triple-bayed plan probably dates to the early  1st century a.d. Its second, Trajanic, form, with a large single arch, dates  173.

The latest evaluation of nearby  buildings reveals that the basilica was constructed no earlier than the early  1st century a.d., according to pottery found in a salvage excavation.186 The  original excavators identified at least two construction phases. Some time  after being damaged ca. a.d. 77 by the earthquake that apparently caused  major destruction in the city, the building was expanded north, south, and  west, with enlarged dimensions of ca. 74.0 by 27.5 m. The rooms at the  north and south ends were apparently eliminated, but the shops along its  east side were maintained. A long, narrow structure, the rebuilt basilica had  an interior colonnade of 16 by 4 columns.187 The date of the second building  phase is uncertain. Cleanup operations and repairs after the earthquake in  the 70s may have gone on for years, and it is likely that the reconstruction  of the basilica did not occur right away, or until there was a new reason for  rebuilding. But Williams has interpreted destruction levels from Building 3  east of the theater as evidence of yet another earthquake early in the  2nd century a.d., so the destruction and rebuilding of the basilica could  have been even later, and does not have to be associated with the damage  done by the one in a.d. 77.188 The original purpose of the Lechaion Road Basilica has not been  determined.189 Perhaps its function evolved as Corinth became the admin- 186.

The program has been restored  from the findspots of the reliefs in the basilica. As discussed above, the  panels in the middle of the nave’s east colonnade illustrated myths about  Aphrodisias’s founding, its great age, and relations with Carian neighbors.  Carved inscriptions, apparently added later, identify the figures, suggesting  that some of them required elucidation, and also that they would have been  visible to spectators below.197 Other basilica sculptural programs explored more directly the theme of  Roman power. A group of fragmentary figural reliefs has been connected  with the badly preserved early imperial basilica at Tarragona in Spain. The  personages include the lower half of a male wearing barbarian leggings, plus  a youth or possibly a woman with long hair, and they have recently been  assigned to a chalcidium tentatively located at the basilica’s east entrance.198  Finally, in Rome, at the Forum of Trajan, monumental statues of Dacians  with pavonazetto bodies and white marble heads have been restored on the  attic level of the exterior facade of the Basilica Ulpia.199 Returning to Corinth, the problem of how and where the panels were  installed on the Lechaion Road Basilica must be confronted, along with  the construction date of the building’s second phase. One possibility is that  they adorned its exterior facade. Before the Captives’ Facade provided an  ornamental and ideological focus along the northeast area of the Forum,  perhaps the south facade of the basilica had served a similar purpose. On  the other hand, the historical aspect of the ensemble, with its classicizing  figures, including at least one hero, may indicate that they fit better inside,  like the examples just discussed. If they adorned the nave, the sculptures could  have constructed a unified public image for the Achaian koinon by alluding  to the history of old Greece. As observed above, the surface of 1, the best- preserved panel, is in good shape, which may support an interior placement.  If the Achaian League used the basilica as its headquarters, the sculptures  would have provided a visual catalogue of its members, unified witnesses to  whatever meetings and rites went on inside. The reliefs might therefore be  tentatively restored to the upper level of the nave, framed between project- ing pilasters or columns. This arrangement, albeit on a smaller scale, would  resemble that of the sculpted friezes on the north portico of the Sebasteion 196. Yıldırım 2004, p. 24. at Aphrodisias, or the sculptures framed by projecting columns decorating 197. Yıldırım 2004, p. 51, fig. 4. 198.
