<plain_text><page sequence="1">Daniel Herwitz The Future of the Past in South Africa: On the Legacy of the TRC VOLUME 5 OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION commission report contains a list of all the victims of gross human rights violations whose names appeared in the commission's database at that time (August 30, 1998)/ The list is arranged in three columns and is nearly 100 pages long. It is a factual compendium, for the archive, in keeping with a crucial intention of the TRC: to gather evidence of atrocity in the name of the nation.1 It is also a memorial, not unlike the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C. by Maya Lin, whose stark litany of the dead is a chronology of loss reduced to names and years. The list of the victims in the TRC report is not cast in the hard currency of cut masonry like Lin's memorial, but appears only as ink on paper. Nevertheless, when read as a memorial rather than a mere compilation of facts, and when read as a distillation of the powerful events of the commission, the report takes on an aura akin to that of Lin's memorial. This is in accord with the religious-biblical character of the TRC, a work of nation-building guided by three men of the cloth - the most famous of whom was Bishop Desmond Tutu who, dressed in his flaming crimson robes and speaking the homilies of divinity before the victims, sternly urged perpetrators to full disclosure and even confession. A report of five volumes whose Utopian gesture is to distill truth into reconciliation, suffering into forgiveness, historical strife into national identity, and word into divinity lends that book the aura of a thing of grace to be reverentially held in one's hands: a bible of contemporary times. social research Vol 72 : No 3 : Fall 2005 531</page><page sequence="2">Consider the name of one person on the TRCs list of victims: Mr. Ahmed Timol. According to volume 3 of the report: Mr. Ahmed Timol . . . died in police custody on 27 October 1971 after allegedly committing suicide by jumping from the tenth floor of security police headquarters at John Vorster Square in Johannesburg. Timol had been in deten- tion for five days. He was the twenty-second person to die in police custody since the introduction of detention with- out trial. Ahmed Timol's mother, Ms. Hawa Timol, described to the Commission how she heard about her son's death: 'On Wednesday 27th [in the] evening my husband and son had gone to the mosque for evening prayers. During this time three policemen who identified them[selves] as SB [Security Branch] came and entered our house. One of them pushed me into a seat and then proceeded to tell me that my son Ahmed had tried to escape by jumping out of the tenth floor of John Vorster Square and that I was to tell my husband that his body was lying in the Hillbrow government mortuary. I could not believe what was being said and in my confusion, I tried to argue that this was not true .... I even remember taking them to the flat windows and saying look how could my son have jumped out of the difficult windows at John Vorster Square' (Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Vol. 3, 542). In fact, Timol had been pushed out of an upper window of the detention center at John Vorster Square in Johannesburg, a not unusual practice of the time. It is with the memorialization of Timol with which I am concerned. To the TRC, the father of Ahmed Timol requested that his son be remembered in these terms: 532 social research</page><page sequence="3">As a family what we would like to have, and I am sure many . . . South Africans would like to have, is that their loved ones should never, ever be forgotten [I]n Ahmed's case a school in his name would be appropriate. But at the end of the day I believe that South Africans in future gener- ations should never, ever forget those that were killed in the name of apartheid. (Vol. 1, 116) Haroon Timol is calling for a memorialization of his son as one of a type: a political activist who was killed in the struggle against apart- heid. Haroon is asking for what many a wealthy captain of industry has done in establishing buildings, sports palaces, foundations, collections, or schools in the name of sons lost during the wars and the terror that have rocked modernity to its foundations in the past and continue to do so now in America and the Middle East. Such memorializations have been personal, but also public recognitions of "those who lost their lives in the Great War." Through public eternalization, through the publidty of a son or daughter's life, the pain of the father or mother may be relieved of at least the burden of privacy. The dead child may live through his or her memorial, and be given his or her due by history. RECOGNITION OF THE DEAD We know how to do it; we do it. Perhaps we cannot live without it. But what is it that we are doing when we do it? What is the meaning of the act, if that is even an appropriate turn of phrase? Consider the language used: In his memory. So that he shall never be forgotten. So that what he did shall always be treasured. Collective memory is a strange thing. While friends and family remember the dead, the collective performs an act of remembrance without actually remem- bering the object of memory. Most of those who enter the portals of what will be the Timol school will not have known Ahmed Timol and cannot strictly speaking be said to remember him. Public memory is the creation of remembrance largely without actual memory, of remem- brance with a different kind and quality of memory. This creation of The Future of the Past in South Africa 533</page><page sequence="4">memory is closely connected to monumentality, since it is also the function of monuments to publicize an event, place it before the public eye, keep the past in consciousness so that it might live a life in the future. Monuments create public memory: of dead martyrs, glorious events, moments of national formation, or group origin in the name of the future through the names and events of the past. In the terms of Maurice Halbwachs, they create collective memory that rewrites the past and articulates group identity around the inscription (Halbwachs, 1992). Haroon Timol wants a school "in his son's name," and in one sense this language is very simple to understand. The school should be named after him, carry his name, in the manner of the high schools dedicated to Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, and George Washington in the United States. The school should be named after him as opposed to given a place name ("Beverly Hills High School") or a descriptive title ("High School of Music and Art, "Technisches Hochschule"). The wish is that, in carrying the name, the school shall stand as a memorialization of his son. It shall be a way of inculcating remembrance of his activism, of what he did. In their names is akin to: to their memories or in their memories. But strictly speaking the dead no longer have memories. To honor them is in one sense equally impossible. The dead can no more remember than they can be the recipients of honors or receive payment for a moral or political debt that society has incurred in the violence committed against them, as in "we must give the dead their due". We honor the dead but do not actually pay them reparations nor elect them to public offices in the new government. We have rock conceits in New York City with Billy Crystal to help their families. We pay tribute to the dead, to their bringing down a plane outside of Pittsburgh which was presumed to have been headed for Washington. But the dead do not receive this tribute. Who receives it, if anyone? It would appear that doing some- thing "in memory of her" is entirely doing something for the living who remember her, or who engage in acts of remembrance even if they did not know her. "In her memory" would therefore translate into "In 534 social research</page><page sequence="5">memory of her." Nothing is actually predicated of the dead person, like memory capacity, or the ability to receive tribute. This formulation does not, however, sit right in the mind: one insists on the thought that one is doing something for the dead, not for the living, even if it is not literally so. Haroon Timol, speaking of dedicating a school, uses the phrase "in his name." Partly, he wants a school named in memory of his dearly departed son, in public recognition of what Ahmed Timol did when he was alive. He wants to pay tribute to his son, while knowing that his son cannot receive this tribute. This is not the same as his wanting to pay tribute to himself, or to the living. That is emphatically not what he wants. There is little way around the paradox: he wants to pay a tribute to his son he knows he cannot pay. This paradox seems to me the core of memorialization. I shall explore it in everything that follows, noting, but not pursuing, the broad importance of Derrida's work on the gift and on giving (Derrida, 1995), and recent work by the South African philosopher Deepak Mistrey.2 Haroon Timol may also think - his words suggest this - that to dedicate a school "in his son's name" is to do "what his son would have wanted." Sometimes public memorialization is not about what the dead would have wanted, merely about what we want to do in their names: which is to use their names to remember the broader picture of events of which they were part. This is certainly part of what is going on during the South African transition, but I think more is at stake in this particular case, and in many such cases where the families of victims were asked how they might be served by the commission. These fami- lies wanted (sometimes) a kind of communion with the dead, a way of relating to their souls as it were. And South African society wished to relieve itself of the burden of its disappeared, through forms of speech and action that would make them reappear. I want to repeat therefore that I do think it likely that a man like Haroon Timol would have conceived of doing something in his son's name as doing something his son would have wanted. Perhaps the father is even thinking about what his son said he wanted - although probably not "what he said he The Future of the Past in South Africa 535</page><page sequence="6">wanted"; most likely they never discussed the matter of how the young son might be memorialized were he thrown from the tenth story of John Vorster Square, or letter bombed, or shot. Such discussions usually do not take place between father and son. Let us take the phrase "in his son's name" to mean the former: "what the son would have wanted." What he would have wanted were he asked then. Or at least, what he would have valued then - values being more general than actual wants. Of course then is then and now is now, and what he might have wanted or valued then might be inappropriate for the postapartheid moment of the South African transition. For example, he might have wanted, were he asked then, to have his name on a school also named for V. I. Lenin. We do not know. Any political moment structures and constrains the possibilities and the forms of appropriateness memorialization may take, and then is then, now is now. Ahmed might even have said back then that he wanted a bomb placed in the High Court of Pretoria so that "the struggle would continue and succeed in his name" (here I am improvising, I do not know his details). It would not have been possible for his father to have issued that as a request, in 1997, before the Truth and Reconciliation Committee, when its members asked him if there was anything they might be able to do for him. It would not have been possible because the politics of the TRC eschewed violence and urged reconciliation, and a bomb is not an element in postapartheid reconcili- ation. Values, formulated at a general enough level, endure over time. Ahmed wanted justice, equality, education, freedom. These are the values he fought for and for which he died. Alive today, he would still value these things. But not necessarily in the same way. Even values, while general constraints on what it would be appropriate to do "in his name," are not decisive.3 It is crucial to what that father is doing that he is not just invent- ing a memorial on the basis of the fit between Ahmed's values (then) and the new dispensation now. He is trying to do something that he believes would please his son, would recognize him, and this means not simply that the gaze of the new South Africa should be upon him, but 536 social research</page><page sequence="7">that Ahmed himself would (were he alive today) feel recognized by the gesture, rather than repelled by it. Were the father to believe he is doing something that probably would repel his son (were his son alive today), he would not be doing it. He has to believe in his heart that this is right for Ahmed, that Ahmed "would have wanted it." A school in his name is perhaps as good a choice as any, since it is politically neutral (education is important to all free societies), and so education has to resonate with the general values Ahmed must have held dear. It is appropriate. Moreover, it is a visual form of remem- brance in two senses: the name will be on the school for generations to see, and it will carry an internal aura of remembrance that will change over time. So the act would be appropriate because 1) it is what the family wants, and 2) it is what the father imagines, deep in his heart, Ahmed would himself have wanted, given who he was then and given what the times are now." What the son would have wanted, or at minimum, would have found a worthy gesture of recognition to which he could reconcile himself. Based on knowledge of his son from the past - of his values and wants - and based in knowledge of present times, the father projects the son's voice into the present. Here the living presume to speak for the dead by imagining a possible world in which the dead are still alive - still have values, wants, and voices; and then by desig- nating themselves their representatives.4 After imagining the possible world in which Ahmed is alive and speaks, his father then serves as his mouthpiece - the way a proxy might be self-nominated to speak in my name at a political convention if I could not be found. Now there is an astonishing twist to this analysis. The father is imagining a possible world in which Ahmed is alive to get the answer to what should happen in Ahmed's name, given that he is dead. Such memorializing language satisfies the fantasy that the dead never go away, that they are still among us. It is a fantasy at the basis of memori- alization and monuments. And so language takes on the aura of remem- brance. At the same time it acknowledges that the dead are dead, and allows us to get past them, to place them in the past. The Future of the Past in South Africa 537</page><page sequence="8">Freud famously stated in Mourning and Melancholia that the mourn- ing process is defined by a movement toward and then away from the dead. Through the dasein of making the dead present, through iden- tification with the dead, the living gain the energy to release them- selves from the burden of grieving. And so the living free themselves from the dead fortzugehen: to move on, to go on living without them. Memorialization makes the dead present through its irreducibly anthropomorphic language or granite, while also acknowledging that they are dead. It satisfies both sides of the mourning process: the fort and the da. This is not all it does. There is an important respect in which "in his name" is about the name and not the bearer of the name. A name rigidly designates a bearer, as Saul Kripke points out, in all possible worlds ("Haroon Timol" designates that person, whether he is alive or dead today). But a name is also comprised of a set of descriptions, images, phrases, and beliefs through which the person is known over time in this changing world. When a building is dedicated in a dead person's name, gradually, over time, the person designated by the name becomes less and less significant (since nobody any more knows him), and his name begins to live a second life in which it is part of the school, like its venerable lintel and neoclassical columns. As this happens, the images and descriptions associated with the name become more vener- able, more mythological. "Ahmed Timol" gradually becomes remem- bered as "one of those struggle heroes from the past," a progenitor of the new South Africa, a founding hero. His father had asked that he be remembered as one of a type and this is what happens: the indi- vidual drops out, the type becomes magnified. His name merges with a number of others, all under the auspices of moral and political justice. The name becomes a link between the then and the now, between the past and the new generation of school children. Through this subtle, creative rewriting of the past that comes with remembrance over time, Ahmed the person is gradually identified with the new meanings his name takes on: the new descriptions and images associated with it. This linguistic change is, in the father's mind, a way of ensuring Ahmed's 538 social research</page><page sequence="9">futurity, his immortality. Ascribing to the name such futurity is a way of repairing the brutality of Ahmed's shortened life: a compensation for the truncated past by reference to the long future. The aura of the name will live its own life through future generations. Reparation is that form of justice which is the paying back of an unpayable debt. You can never bring back a dead man and put him again on the hundred and fifth floor of the World Trade Towers, nor retrieve your grandparents from the camps. You can never erase slavery from the past. What you can do is provide recognition and compen- sation (and in some cases, punishment through the rule of law) that will help the process of overcoming. Crucial to the memorialization of Ahmed Timol is an attempt to repair the past by deference to the future: by giving his name a life in the future. TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE It should be clear that the wider range of my concern is with transitional justice. Transitional justice is the kind of justice distinctive to nations on the rocky road from authoritarian regimes characterized by gross violations of human rights to those that are classified as liberal democ- racies. The concept of transitional justice was introduced to capture specific characteristics pertinent to such nations - for example, their turn towards truth commissions and their relations to law and consti- tutionality. However, I believe memorialization, a crucial ingredient in the justice of transitions, also falls under the broader scope of the justice pertinent to transitions. What is the idea behind transitional justice? A nation in transition from authoritarianism to liberal democracy has a unique set of needs: 1) the need to punish perpetrators from the past regime and relatedly, to thereby strengthen the rule of law against forces of terror remaining in the society; 2) the need for the kind of social healing that comes not from punishment but instead from public exercises in reconciliation; 3) the need for specific spectacles of transition, often in an international forum or through the media, which will build the moral capital of the new regime and garner support; 4) the need to delicately appease those The Future of the Past in South Africa 539</page><page sequence="10">from the old regime, so that transition will not be derailed by a coup or other regressive means; and 5) the need to strengthen the new state while also freeing it of the remnants of the past. These needs are not exactly consistent, hence the dilemma of transition. This liability of demands to conflict as a society veers toward - it is hoped - best possible justice is specific to the kind of moment of transition where the state is not yet powerful but is in need of power, where populations require harmonization, and where past and future require recalibration, each by themselves, and each in relationship to the other. As is well known, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a negotiation that resulted from all of these needs. By 1989 it was clear that neither the African National Congress nor the National Party and the South African Defense Forces could win an outright civil war. This, along with the collapse of communism worldwide, brought both sides to the negotiating table. The Coalition for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) talks of 1991-1992 carried initial negotiations forward in a formal way and resulted in the interim government of Nelson Mandela and F. W. de Klerk, the timetable for elections (1994), and the interim constitution (also in 1994). The interim constitution in turn mandated the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and three commit- tees, including the Committee on Amnesty- which was so controver- sial that its mandate appeared only as a postscript to the constitution. The kind of amnesty offered was qualified. Amnesty would be granted in exchange for full disclosure of the truth and demonstra- tion that the crimes committed were "in proportion" to the hypo- thetical goals that motivated the larger scheme of action of which the crimes were a part. Full disclosure would be measured by the Amnesty Committee on the basis of the proceedings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings. Proportionality would be decided on the basis of whether a gross violation of human rights could be explained in terms of the larger political motive that compelled the perpetrator to act: a motive such as keeping the state intact or "winning the war against the communists." While the concept of proportional- ity is in one respect absurd - given that what are being investigated 540 social research</page><page sequence="11">are gross violations of human rights that are of their very nature out of proportion from human decency - the idea is to distinguish between acts directed at "the enemy" from random killings of children, rape of women bystanders, or torture of old people, which cannot be defended as actions performed "for the cause" in the way the assassination of presumed "political targets" can be. Proportionality is a way of exclud- ing acts, not a coherent principle of including them. Qualified amnesty brought with it conceptual as well as moral problems; what is right in the theory of transitional justice is that qual- ified amnesty cannot be measured against a timeless, universal, and unyielding concept of justice against which it would fail. Rather, the concept of justice itself has to be understood in a more contextual fash- ion, with inconsistent demands (at least sometimes) relevant to specific historical moments. Qualified amnesty emerged from the CODESA talks as a compromise formation: the African National Congress wanted outright punishment for crimes, the National Party wanted blanket amnesty. The alternative to qualified amnesty might well have produced a stalemate to the transitional process, even civil war. Qualified amnesty allowed, moreover, the TRC to formulate itself as a proceeding motivated by forgiveness, reconciliation, and nation-build- ing, rather than the sterner stuff of retribution. There could have been no Desmond Tutu, Alec Borraine, or Bongani Finca in a truth commis- sion of the Nuremburg type, no assimilation of the TRC to the New Testament. In short, the aura generated by the players in the TRC and occasioned for so many readers by the report, depended on qualified amnesty. This aura of the biblical: of forgiveness, reparation, and moral nation-building, is central to the report's language of memorialization. It is central to the way moral awe is built up and set forth as the agenda of the nation. Moral awe, the aura of the report, the sublime: there are a constellation of attitudes that have social and political roles at moments of nation-building. Kant and neo-Kantian traditions have stressed the importance of these attitudes for the formation of communities with shared moral sensibility. Part of the aesthetics of transition is about the way in which such attitudes function socially. (Another aspect of the The Future of the Past in South Africa 541</page><page sequence="12">aesthetics of transition concerns the question of symbolic images - the Rainbow Nation for example - that are propagated over the airwaves and grip the nation. Still another concerns the ways culture and power are negotiated through museums, universities, the media, and so on.) The forms of memorialization appropriate to the TRC have a clear moral and political formation in the South African transition, and this is a way of spelling out the relationship between aesthetics, morality, and politics. There is a more general question of the liability of demands, and not only demands, but rights, to conflict, as they are multiplied, and then for the philosopher, of trying to bring the plethora of rights - economic, political, social, cultural - under a coherent rubric of justice, that is, a theory. There has been a massive exfoliation of rights in social and political life since the end of the Second World War. The multi- tude of documents, agreements, and resolutions bout social, political, economic, and gender rights that are meant to regulate the practices of states, groups, and individuals is a fact of international life. As this exfo- liation produces more and more kinds of rights, their liability to come into conflict increases, both in terms of their application to contexts, and in terms of their interpretive meanings. There are many kinds of ways, in many kinds of contexts, where we propose and reflect on rights. I am in agreement with Amy Gutman's (2001) view that human rights do - and should - have multiple supporting frameworks (politi- cal, social, metaphysical). Now it is essential to transitional justice that memorialization is a giving of the past its due even as it is a way of envisioning a second life for the past in the future. The moment of transition is one of a poten- tially chaotic break with the past, and the setting of a new agenda for the future nation is crucial to the success of the moment. The setting of that agenda is a constitutional matter, a civic matter, but also a matter for cultural symbolizations. Always remember your roots; always live through your descendents. Through acts of reparation the moral duty of the future to live by honoring the past is instituted. A vision of moral continuity into the future is set forth, and that vision is part of what 542 social research</page><page sequence="13">institutes continuity at a moment of tumultuous social change. This is a crucial reason for the turn to truth commissions at moments of transition. They provide living symbols for the moral future by work- ing through the violent past. In doing so, they institute a regime of remembrance for the future, about the past. Reparation happens in the form of nation-building. And so Timol* s name, living a life in the future, institutes the moral authority of remembrance. This is the prescription for the future of the past, articulated early on in the moment of social transition. That such heightened emotions should have been felt then about regimes of remembrance, such digni- fied gestures made toward their articulation, proved crucial for shap- ing the peaceful and productive character ofthat fragile time. The TRC failed to accomplish many things, but it's emphasis on victim dignity and the capacity of a new society to re-imagine its terms of citizenship around that was amazing. Indeed, even the vociferous criticisms of the TRC voiced by many different people for many different reasons proved a social good: finally there was an event about which the entire nation could agree to respectfully disagree. Public speech is a good antidote to violence. Transitional justice requires a new public sphere to arise in which toleration of powerful divergences of opinion are respected, partly because the level of disagreement is one that brings to the fore- ground the deepest issues facing the nation. Thabo Mbeki's debate with Bishop Tutu (before it degenerated into mud slinging) was originally about whether gestures of reconciliation such as provided by the TRC were not shielding "the real problem," namely that of two nations, one white, one black, the one holding onto resources and power, the other still economically disenfranchised. However you came down on that debate, it was one where the real issues were on the table: the TRC could only go so far (how far?), and economic justice was yet to happen (how should it?). Those who absolutely rejected the TRC, such as the family of black consciousness leader Steve Biko - brutally slain by the apartheid thugs - who despised the idea of qualified amnesty, at least had the chance to voice that opinion, to give reasons and to be heard. Around the TRC something happened that was first wholly in its spirit The Future of the Past in South Africa 543</page><page sequence="14">(public debate) and second made possible only by its terms of public ritual. Disagreement with it proved its importance to the transition. Around the TRC the culture of an open society arose. Moreover, the goals of the TRC were Utopian, indeed biblical, as I have written at length in my book Race and Recondliation (2003). But its direct role in the solidification of political agreement between warring parties (the National Party, the African National Congress) cannot be overstated. That process had been going on from the power-sharing moment between de Klerk and Mandela and the Kempton Park accords to the formulation of the interim constitution in 1994. This same kind of negotiated process simultaneously led to the making of the final consti- tution of South Africa (which appeared at the same time as the TRC started, in 1996). That document with its emphasis on a multiplicity of human rights, undergirded by a luminous concept of human dignity, contains the same kind of thinking. Indeed, the interim constitution that mandated the TRC had contained a preamble explicitly calling for the creation of a culture of reconciliation. While the final constitution shed such explicit references to reconciliation, it nevertheless exhib- ited the moral beneficence of the period by mandating that each and every constitutional decision take place with reference to the spirit of the constitution as a whole - thus demanding of judges that they keep general ideas of dignity and human rights always in mind when setting law against shifting social reality. Such mindfiilness would perhaps have pleased Ahmed Timol's father. His request that Ahmed's name appear on the lintel of a school is finally a request for future justice, since at the time Ahmed lived there were few schools for people like himself (people of color) to attend, worthy of Ahmed's name. During the days of apartheid students of color at the University of Natal's black medical school were barred from use of most other university facilities, including the library, and these students were consigned to separate quarters off campus. Primary education for students of color was nothing short of indecent; the relatively high-qual- ity educations received by black African leaders like Mandela and Walter Sissulu were the product of pre-apartheid, colonial schooling that had 544 social research</page><page sequence="15">been systematically dismantled by the apartheid state and was not avail- able to Ahmed Timol's generation. And so the asking for a school to be named for Ahmed is in effect a demand for justice to take place within civil society: a demand that education be made equal. This was happening furiously during the heady days of educational reform in the 1990s, but still has a very long way to go. The demand for schools of quality (worthy of Ahmed Timors name) is one the constitution can - and if need be, must - enforce. Recent judgments have interpreted the "human dignity" clause as requiring the state make a "reasonable effort" (given means) to ensure that human rights (housing, work, education, health care) be offered to all citizens. Were educational reform not happening in a way deemed a "reasonable effort/' the court could rule against the state. It has famously done just that about issues of both housing and rollouts of anti-retroviral medications for HIV. And so the TRCs moral regime of remembrance is finally, when read in larger context, a demand for human rights instituted by force of law. And that is how I read the significance of Haroon Timors remarks. The TRCs moral regime of remembrance is, I believe, embodied in relevant interpretative directives of the constitution. However, it is less easily embodied in state and civil society. The 1990s were mostly about a new South African state weak in relationship to industry and bank- ing on neoliberalism to produce wealth and deliver materials for better housing, employment, education, safety. The South African state freely (without being pressured since it was not a debtor) took on to itself the rigors of structural adjustment so as to make itself attractive to foreign investment, which was partially motivated by (misguided) ideas of economic justice, and partially by mere weakness before industry. Millions of jobs were lost, and employment (hard to measure precisely) runs at around 40 percent. Some South African industries have actually outsourced labor to China. HIV/AIDS has devastated an entire generation, crippling the econ- omy and sending the state into an irrational and bizarre tailspin over health allocation of anti-retroviral drugs and treatment. South Africa has lost teachers to the pandemic in unrecoverable numbers. The state The Future of the Past in South Africa 545</page><page sequence="16">is increasingly a closed cabal circulating around the state president like an old-style communist cell. The TRC is hardly spoken about in public culture today, and repa- rations to victims have not been properly delivered. Even if the spirit of the TRC is evident in constitutional court decisions, today, a consti- tution is finally nothing but a piece of paper. Apart from a culture of human judgment, it means little or nothing. Similarly, the state is noth- ing but a space for the deployment of power apart from the dignity of those who inhabit it. What we take away from the words of Haroon Timol is this: it is the task of each generation to ensure that the young people of the future - who will have grown up with no experience of apartheid, but great experience of the harsh struggle for existence - understand and acknowledge the meaning and importance of those names cast onto the lintels of their schools for their collective future. The meaning and importance of those names is, I have suggested, a demand for good law and good judgment. Indeed, it is the task of the entire society, from education and civil courts to public culture, to refuse to let the meaning of Timor s name die. The legacy of the TRC is that of a perpetual duty of remembrance. Political economy may define the material possibilities for human rights, but cannot produce justice without these lessons of public memory, continually relearned. NOTES * I wish to thank Andre DuToit and Deepak Mistrey for helpful comments on this paper. Versions of this paper have been presented at the University of Michigan, the University of Natal, and the University of Toronto, all of which provided valuable comments. 1. In the new version of the report (the first was published on October 29, 1998), the list will contain short paragraphs about each victim. But we still have the question: Why have this list at all, given that victims could be cross-referenced by an index at the back? The answer surely has to do with the desire to highlight the victims in a certain format, and I think of this as, in part, a memorializing format. 546 social research</page><page sequence="17">2. See Deepak Mistrey (2000), especially the following passage: A strange structure, then [of dedication and memorializa- tion] ... in which almost nothing happens, a giving without giving, a giving for the sake of giving in which neverthe- less not nothing is given. We have moved to where Levinas' imagination perforce moves us, from saying as giving to giving as giving, from a situation in which giving is retro- spectively read into the act of saying who signs also signify. . . . [W]e have therefore bypassed the gift, the giving of something, say money, which for some reason cannot be dedicated, to arrive at dedication, a giving in which giving is truly nothing but giving, giving for the sake of giving. Unlike the gift, which is always the gift of something, the giving involved in dedication is more truly a giving for the sake of giving, since while in dedication the act of giving takes place, nothing, nothing like a familiar object, with use value, or aesthetic value, is given As if all that were given were the intention to give, as if we were not talking about a case, in the grammatical sense, here at all, but were rather talking about a mood, namely the optative: I wish I could give you everything, but alas I do not have it to give. Also, you are not able to receive. But in spite ofthat, I give it to you. I give. Pure or close to pure intention" (2000: 20, italics in original). Mistrey's distinction between giving and dedication is a useful one for me. One can dedicate a school "in his name" but not actually give the school to Ahmed Timol, in the way that one could give it (literally give it) to, for example, President Thabo Mbeki, who would then be its owner. Mistrey's work is remarkably convergent with an earlier paper of Ted Cohen's, "Figurative Speech and Figurative Acts," in which Cohen highlights to importance of speech acts whose peculiar power The Future of the Past in South Africa 547</page><page sequence="18">depends upon their flouting of ordinary illocutionary force (Cohen, 1975: 669-684). Cohen's example is "I promise to love you forever," which (strictly speaking) cannot be promised, since it is a condition of promising that one represent oneself as having the intention to keep one's promise, and few could pull off representing themselves as having the intention of living forever! The point of this speech act (promising to live forever) derives from the impossibility. Cohen calls it a figurative promise. Clearly (and this is the connection with Mistrey) the intention is "optative," Indeed, it would be useful to wonder whether one is not performing an act of dedication in prom- ising (to a spouse, a child . . . ) to live forever, an act of the kind: I am dedicating myself to you in a special way. 3. I am helped here by remarks of Peter Railton in private conversation. 4. There is no implied belief in the ontological "reality" of possible worlds here, merely the claim that possible worlds exist as figments of Haroon Timors imagination. REFERENCES Cohen, Ted.
