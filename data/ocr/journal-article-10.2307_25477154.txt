High Island, the Ard Oilean of Colgan, Ware and O'Flaherty, lies beyond Friar's Island and two miles west of Aughrus Point in Connemara, the most westerly land in County Galway. North of it are the larger islands of Inishark and Inishbofin, south is Cruagh Island and, sheltered in an angle south of the Aughrusbeg peninsula, Omey Island, which is joined to the mainland except at high tide. The highest point of this block of mica schist which is High Island is 208 feet above the sea and it slopes from about this height at the north end to about eighty feet at the south. Its coast is much indented and consists for the most part of over hanging cliffs which make landing impossible except in two rela tively sheltered coves at the north-east end of the island. Eighty acres of undulating grassland have supported large numbers of sheep within living memory; three tiny lakes and two wells provided water for them. It has long been uninhabited. The last people to live perm anently on the island were the miners who for some years be ginning in 1828 dug copper for the local landlord, Colonel Martin of Ballynahinch, out of the deep shaft a short way above the landing place.1 They lived in two houses nearby, which were marked as 'Ruins' on the Ordnance Survey Fair Plan in 1839.2 The much-ruined hermitage at the further end of the island was founded by St Fechin (600-664), who had earlier founded the little monastery on Omey and whose name, Latinised Festus, is still given at baptism to many of the boys in the locality. The monastery is sited in a hollow at the south-west and most remote end of the island, beside the largest of the lakes. Here is 1. G.H. Kin ah an, J. Nolan, H. Leonard and B.J.

High Island hermitage, cloch?n E, from the north-east. almost as far as one can reach from the landing place. West lies only the Atlantic; the only part of the mainland to be seen lies low on the horizon away to the south-east at Slyne Head. The island of Inishark, on the north side, can be seen only by climbing a little way out of the hollow, and it is then framed between the cliff-like edges of a great indent the sea has made there, only fifty metres from the monastery itself; and the most awesome of three at this end of the island. To see further north and south, one must climb well to the north above the monastic enclosure, when the island appears as one of a great chain of islands stretching south from Achill: Clare Island, Caher Island, Inishturk, Inishark and Inishbofin, many of which had at one time remote monasteries similar to that of High Island. Despite this impression of being part of a chain of islands, the dominant feeling is one of isolation and remoteness, of subjection to the power of the sea. The High Island foundation, thus remote from the world, is brought close to nature. The sea in its benign moods laps the rocks which reach down towards it at this end of the island and from which one could fish and swim with ease. In its savage moods, driven by gales from the west or north, its sound on the cliffs and inlets on all sides must have been terrifying for the hermits, 53</page><page sequence="3">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW and the whole enclosure must have been washed with sea-spray. Whereas in good weather there is shelter from most breezes below the declivity under which the monastery sits, one could hardly hope for more than a little relief in a storm. In springtime, the storm petrel nests among the ruined stones of the monastery, and the pink thrift and the white sea-campion flourish. It is easy to recreate there the ambience in which the nature poetry of the Early Christian period was written. The descriptions of this tiny monastery of St Fechin date from the nineteenth century. They were written by George P?trie in 1820,3 John O'Donovan in June 1839,4 G. H. Kinahan 5 and R. A. S. Macalister.6 None of these appears to have spent more than a few hours on the island but all, with the probable exception of Macalister, were able to see the ruins in a much better state of preservation than they are now, and their observations of certain details are therefore valuable. No proper plan has been made; the Ordnance Survey, unhappily, did not do one, and Kinahan's sketch-plan is misleading since he confuses the inner and the outer enclosures. I therefore welcome the opportunity to put on record a tentative plan and reconstruction of this ruined but striking hermitage, based on field work done in the summer of 1976, with a short consideration of its context. Despite the destruction of the nineteenth century, which local tradition suggests was wrought by the miners in search of building stone, the High Island monastery is one of the few relatively well preserved island monasteries that exist today. Unlike many other monasteries, it seems to be free of later burials. It appears also to have retained its primitive form without significant change throughout the four centuries during which it was certainly in use. It is thus an important document in the reconstruction of the earliest phases of Christian building in Ireland.

Reconstructed plan of the hermitage at High Island; additions based on the nineteenth-century descriptions shown with broken lines. The hermitage is a walled enclosure, roughly quadrangular in shape, sited in a hollow on the edge of the largest of the three lakes and built of the dark slaty schist of the island. Its south wall was built straight along the edge of the lake, and originally was probably no more than 80 cm thick. The wall on the east side apparently faced an edge scarped out from a natural terrace rising steeply above it and was again virtually straight. On the west and north sides there is a substantial curved wall about 3 m thick, wide enough to incorporate two wall-chambers in its fabric. There are four entrances, in the north-east, north-west, south-west and south-east corners, and the area enclosed is quite small, its longest and shortest axes measuring 35 and 28 metres. (Fig. 2). The southern half of the enclosure, nearest the lake, is clear of buildings. Within this open space, in a central position stands a 55</page><page sequence="5">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW Fig. 3. High Island hermitage, cross-slab in the open space within the enclosure. cross-slab [A] of schist with its design in the south side, facing the lake (Fig. 3). The right-hand, eastern edge has been broken off. The date of the design need not be much later than the year 700; it might even belong to the time of the foundation of Fechin in the middle of the seventh century. Nearby is a sphere of granite 46 cm across. This part of the enclosure, then, was an open, public place with the cross-slab as its focus. In the northern half of the enclosure stood the principal building, the oratory [B], with the other buildings of the mon astery grouped around it. This tiny oratory was built in the conventional orientation, its simple battered doorway facing north of west and a tiny window above an altar in the opposite wall facing south of east. The internal measurements are 4 m long by 3.2 m broad, the building therefore being almost square in shape. The lintel now over the doorway is a re-used cross-slab and above this the gable is built in a much cruder masonry than the lower courses: it is therefore a reconstruction. There is now no trace 56</page><page sequence="6">THE HIGH ISLAND HERMITAGE of the roofing or its supports but it probably was of conventional timber-framed construction. A rare and noteworthy feature of the oratory is the rectangular walled enclosure which surrounds it. Though much ruined and masked by falling stones, it appears to follow the rectangular outline of the church, ranging between 1.20 and 2.70m in distance from it. The area inside formed a sheltered walkway around the oratory. It was in the wider space at the eastern end of this walkway that P?trie saw in 1820 "an ancient stone sepulchre like a pagan kistvaen, composed of large mica slates with a cover of limestone".7 The end-stones were "rudely sculptured with ornamental crosses and a human figure" and the covering-slab was also carved [C]. From its prominent position and elaborate ornamentation, I take this to be probably the tomb of the founder or first abbot. The only "entrance discernible in the surrounding wall is in the north-east corner and it has a rude corbelled arch over it. P?trie records "a covered passage about 15ft long by 3ft wide"; traces of this can be discerned today, leading past the doorway of the stone cell opposite to the north-east entrance. The enclosure and its approach passage mark the structures within and near it as having a special significance. The stone wall or cloch?n in the north wall [D] is unique in that its entrance faces the entrance to this enclosure. It has a rectilinear base, 2.2m square on the inside, and its roof is a stone beehive superimposed on this. Its position suggests that it housed the most important personage of the monastery, the abbot or principal guest. The second of the two remaining clochons [E] is built onto the outside of the enclosing wall of the oratory on the east side and is roughly the same size. Its doorway faces east and away from the oratory. P?trie8, Kinahan^ and O'Donovan10 each did drawings of this cell, which has massive walls and a large splayed entrance. Perhaps it was a communal building, a scriptor ium or refectory. There is evidence from the older accounts of three further buildings within the enclosure. O'Donovan in a pencilled descrip tion in the Ordnance Survey Namebook,11 and Kinahan^ both described a ruined cloch?n apparently in the angle beside the 7.

Kinahan, Ruins on Ardillaun, 553. 57</page><page sequence="7">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW north-east entrance; O'Donovan makes it 12 feet long by 9 feet broad, Kinahan about 9 feet square. It may have been a gatehouse [F]. P?trie refers to "a number of smaller cells" on the west side of the chapel. Two are tentatively indicated in this area at [G] and [H] in the sketch plan (Fig. 2). The remains of another building guard the south-east entrance [I] but this is different in that it is rectangular with relatively thin walls and is placed outside the enclosure. A very fine corbelled wall-chamber [J], 6.6 by 1.2m, referred to by Kinahan as The Prison, 13 runs under the enclosing wall in the south-west quadrant. Its doorway is in the south-east corner. Kinahan describes a similar smaller chamber, "nine feet long by four and a half feet wide" in the wall north of the north-west entrance [K], but no trace of this is visible today since this part of the wall is almost completely ruined. The High Island hermitage is therefore a simple enclosure with an oratory and a handful of stone huts, the two huts remaining being, with the oratory, the principal buildings of the establish ment. The focal points of the enclosure were the oratory, the tomb on the east side of it and the stone cross-slab to the south. The wall surrounding the oratory and tomb is unique and intriguing, the more so since it was apparently approached by a covered passageway. The whole establishment can hardly have housed more than ten devotees. North of the hermitage, between it and the cliff, is a small triangular garden about 40m long by 25m broad at the base. Its east side is bounded by a wall continuing from the east wall of the monastery; above this a clearly marked lynchet has formed from the accumulation of earth washed from the slope above it. The wall on the west side is now only faintly marked. On the edge of the cliff, at the apex of this triangle, are the remains of a rect angular building [L] now marked only by the low upright stones of the wall foundations. Beside this was the entrance through the wall to the enclosure.14 About 60m east, outside the monastery and this enclosing wall, overlooking it and sheltered by high ground on the east and south, is a circular stone enclosure about 8m across. Its entrance is apparently in the north-west, facing the hermitage, and it commands a much better view of sea and land than the hermitage below. Perhaps this was a guest-house [M]. The larger lake beside the hermitage empties itself into the sea 13. ibid., 554. 14. ibid., 552. 58</page><page sequence="8">THE HIGH ISLAND HERMITAGE Penitential Station O Wells a Dam v Copper Mine Fig. 4. Early Christian remains on High Island. 59</page><page sequence="9">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW through a small stream which runs out of it on the western side. At its end, above the sea, stands a rectilinear drystone structure, apparently part of a dam for controlling the water level at the outflow [N]. Kinahan refers to this as a mill-dam, stating that a mill which stood here in ancient times had gone by his day.!5 A small pond about 3m by 2m was formed by building an L-shaped wall against the edge of the lake immediately south of the outflow; was this a flax-pond? [O]. A second, smaller lake stands a little to the south of this larger one. Even in the extremely dry summer of 1976 neither of these lakes dried up, although a third one higher up at the west end of the island did. Both were cut off from the rest of the island by a stone wall running roughly south from the south-east corner of the larger lake and ending close to the sea in the foundations of a rectangular building [P] not unlike that at the northern entrance to the monastery. This is a rectangular heap of stones [Q] with, standing at one end of it, an anthropomorphic cross-slab. Between the two lakes is a tiny enclosure [R], about 3m by 2m overall, not mentioned in the older descriptions. The third [S] stands on the edge of the sea, a little distance south of the smaller lake, and now has a holed stone set up beside it. Fig. 5.

The first [T] is in the centre, near Brian Boru's Well, and is marked by a slab which has a cross with expanded arms incised on both faces. Thesecond [W] is above the landing place and is marked by a slab engraved with a small Latin cross. Opposite the arms of the cross, the edges of the slab have two slight expansions and on the narrow edge beside the left-hand arm is a small Maltese cross, deeply incised. Two other ancient walls remain to be noted; these are short stretches of stone wall, one running across the narrow neck of land above the landing place, and a second near the lake at the west end of the island. They indicate that the ancient inhabitants of the island practised some form of animal management. * * * Fig. 6.

On the north side of Omey Island, in a little hollow sheltered on the west and north by rocks and now covered in blown sand, is Teampall Fechin, the church of Fechin, who is said to have converted the inhabitants of Omey from paganism and set up this foundation before going on to High Island. Nearby is a burial ground. It was here that Colgan, the sixteenth-century hagio grapher, found one of the three manuscript lives of Fechin on which he based his own.16 The east gable and part of the north wall are now exposed. Both are built almost entirely of the local pink granite, originally squared and mortared with a good shell mortar. In the centre of the gable is the standard single window, which has an embrasure about a metre wide on the inner side. This is a much larger building than the simple oratory on High Island, being about 4.50m in width, and in its present form is probably much later in date. Its position opposite High Island, on what is virtually the mainland, suggests that this was the landing-point for the hermits of the island. Similar mainland churches are situated opposite island hermitages on the west coast, at Streedagh opposite Inishmurray in County Sligo, and at Temple Cashel17 above St Finan's Bay and opposite the monastery on the larger Skellig in County Kerry. These foundations were probably built to provide a monastic ambience for the hermits if they were cut off by bad weather from their own monastery on the island. Simple monasteries of the kind found on High Island are sited all along the west coast of Ireland, particularly on the islands. Their history is normally brief, their lore almost as slight. Frequently the only trace of art is found on the cross-slab, which is always a prominent monument, and their buildings show a minimum of architectural elaboration. Besides the tiny rectangular oratory, beehive cells of stone (cloch?ns) are found, 16. James F.

Their simplicity suggests that their builders were drawn by the ideals of the primitive and the ascetic and that their communities were extremely conservative. They contrast strongly with the developed monastic towns of the midlands and east of the country, like Monasterboice, Fore and Kells, with their more spacious buildings and elaborate High Crosses, which grew and evolved in the centuries up to 900 and again in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and even later, in response to changing fashion. The cross-slab now standing in the open space south of the oratory in the High Island hermitage is the only feature of the complex capable of being closely dated [A]. Its design is the same as that of the medallions of the gilt-bronze belt shrine, also from an ecclesiastical milieu, found at N^oylough, County Sligo.18 This shrine is dated to the eighth century, so the slab need not be more than half a century later in date than the foundation of the hermitage by Fechin, say in 650. A similarly early cross-slab stands in Gannew townland at the thirteenth station of St Colmcille's turas or penitential round at Glencolumbkille in County Donegal.19 This slab can be dated by its close similarity in design to that of a glass stud made to take a metal inset, and found in its clay mould in the lake-dwelling of Lagore in County Meath,20 which in turn resembles the decorative studs of the eighth-century Ardagh Chalice.21 The Donegal slab indicates that the custom of the turas or pilgrimage-round of penitential stations may be as old as Christian ity itself in Ireland, and the penitential stations in the vicinity of the High Island hermitage may be of similar antiquity. This may also be true of some of the stations indicated inside and around the Caher Island hermitage.22 In this custom of the turas may lie an explanation of one of the unusual features of the enclosure at High Island, its four entrances regularly spaced round the enclosing wall, the two landward ones having huts beside them, as if to regulate the entry of strangers. Perhaps these entrances were 18. Fran?oise Henry, Irish Art in the Early Christian Period (to 800 A.D.) (London: Methuen, 1965), p. 105, Pis. 34, 35. 19. Liam Prince.

The shape of the monastic enclosure is neither rectilinear nor circular; it appears rather as an adaptation to its siting, tucked in under the scarped terrace to the east of it, encroaching in a straight line on the edge of the tiny lake to the south of it. Such adaptation of the shape of the monastic enclosure to the often rough and inhospitable terrain of the west is not unknown elsewhere: the hermitage on the Skellig rock in Kerry is really a series of roughly rectangular terraces,23 and so is Killabuonia24 on the mainland nearby. These rectilinear terraced outlines may also be evidence of an early tradition of Christian building in the west of Ireland in which the circular outline now so familiar elsewhere in both monastic and secular enclosures was not rigidly prescribed. Wall-chambers like those at High Island are common features in secular and monastic buildings in the Celtic and Early Christian traditions of Ireland and Scotland. Staigue Fort in County Kerry is one famous example of such structures in a secular context.25 An example in the monastic enclosure at Caher Island north of here has been documented by Dr Fran?oise Henry22 (Fig. 7). If a functional rather than a traditional explanation of their presence is sought, then those in the hermitages might be regarded as places of penitential observance.

Both might have been built to create a processional way around the oratory, but the fact that we know so few examples among the many similar monasteries preserved along the west coast suggests that these are unique adaptations, possibly to the environment. This inner enclosure may have been made necessary by the siting of the hermitage so close to the Atlantic storms; it was to protect the tiny community from the sea-spray or, more likely, from the gale gusts which might sweep infirm members across the open bawn of the monastery and into the lake or the ocean. The fact that there is evidence for a covered way linking the oratory's enclosure with the principal cell opposite its entrance may lend weight to this suggestion. This unique inner enclosure, by surrounding the oratory and tomb, tends to mask the fact that, at the focus of the hermitage, there are three standard elements of the simple western monastery, cross-slab, oratory and saint's tomb, the first two visible today, the third attested by George Petrie's description of 1820. All three are present at Killabuonia28 in Kerry, where the tomb is of the simple dog-kennel form well-known in Kerry and where the cross-slab stands between the tomb and the oratory (Fig. 8), cross and tomb ranged on the line of the west gable of the oratory. Two of the three can be seen, and the third presumed, at Loher,29 south of Waterville, on the Skellig itself,30 on Illaunloghan,31 an island near Portmagee in Kerry, and at Caher Island.22 The arrangement of these three elements at the focal point of the monastery seems also to have been an ideal at the foundation of some early monasteries in the east of the country. At Clonmacnoise,32 which was founded by Ciaran in 547 and grew over centuries into a very large enclosure having several churches, 27. W.F.

The present cathedral, which presumably stands on the site of the original church of the founder, has in front of its west entrance a High Cross erected about the year 908, the Cross of the Scriptures, on which the names of Colman, the abbot, and Flann, the king of Meath, are inscribed. This probably replaces an earlier cross-slab like those on High Island at this site. A short distance north-east of the church is the tiny Teampall Chiar?in, traditionally said to have been Ciaran's tomb, in which was found, early in the last century, the Crozier of the Abbots of Clonmacnoise, along with a number of other monastic relics. This building is thus a reliquary to house the bones and relics of the founder-saint, as is St Declan's House at Ardmore in Waterford and the Priests's House at Glendalough, both of quite late style; the analogue in Kerry is the simple dog-kennel shrine of sites like Killabuonia, Illaunloghan and Killoluaig,33 where the saint's bones might be revered by touching them through a hole in the gable end of the tomb. Slane in County Meath has still the remains of one of these primitive shrines on the south side of the church.34 The existence of such a primitive shrine in County Meath suggests that this type of tomb was widespread in the east of the country from the beginning of Christianity and that it was later replaced by more elaborate structures, as new fashions were adopted by monastic communities. Meanwhile, the west of the country adhered to the primitive ideal, retaining the simpler structures. We have come a long way from High Island but it appears that the conjunction of oratory, cross-slab and founder's tomb was once common throughout the country, east and west, developing later into something more elaborate in the richer east, retaining its primitive cast in the ascetic and conservative west. About the year 650, when Fechin came west from Fore in Westmeath and Cong in Mayo to the Atlantic at Omey and High Island, he may have been in retreat from a richer and more crowded east, seeking to achieve an asceticism of spirit in the austere and primitive environment of the west. He may even have recognised in the eastern monasteries latent or already developing signs of a trend towards worldliness: simple cross-slabs were soon to develop into elaborate High Crosses at Ahenny in the 33.
