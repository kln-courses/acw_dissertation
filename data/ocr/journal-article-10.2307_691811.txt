<plain_text><page sequence="1">APOLLO THE WIND-GOD. Der Apollonmythus und seine Deutung. Von Dr. KONRAD SEHRWALD. S. Calvary, Berlin: 1895. (Berliner Studien fiir Classische Philologie und Archaeologie.) 1 Mk. 20. THis monograph of thirty-six pages aims at proving that Apollo was originally not a sun-god but a personification of Air. Dr. Sehrwald begins by a short criticism of the arguments which are commonly urged in support of the solar theory, and then ex- pounds his own views on the origin of the god. It appears that Apollo was the pure health-giving air which enwraps the earth, the son of Zeus (who is the upper air) and Leto, who was once turned into a shrew- mouse, and wore a dark robe, whence it is shown that she represents the dark air that permeates the interior of the earth. Hera, being, like Zeus, a deity of the higher atmosphere, with a liking for storms, is jealous of the young god of the lower air. The battle between the Delian Apollo and Pytho typifies the victory won by the healthy, island-born breeze over the foul vapours which lay over Delphi, the omphalos of the world, i.e. over all the face of the earth. The connexion of Apollo and the laurel becomes evident, when we reflect that, according to Pliny, this tree is re- markable as a purifier of the air. The god who first made the earth habitable is natur- ally the founder of cities. In order that the city atmosphere may be kept whole- some, Apollo was worshipped in the darkest and narrowest streets, and the street-doors were put under his protection (p. 15). The immortal gods fear the arms of Apollo, which can take away their health; for, as Dr. Sehrwald carefully explains, the gods can speak and cry aloud and must therefore breathe. And so, when Apollo bends his bow against the assembled gods, they all</page><page sequence="2">414 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. rise from their seats in alarm; only Zeus and Leto, the true air-deities, smile and remain seated (pp. 22, 23). After some pages of similar arguments, the author sums up with the conclusion that the mani- fold functions of Apollo, as the god of life and death, of philosophy, prophecy, sea- faring, and medicine, all follow directly from the single primitive conception of the wind-god. If this method of mythological interpre- tation were peculiar to Dr. Sehrwald, a few words of criticism might well suffice. The method, when pushed to extremes, results in patent absurdities which may be left to speak for themselves. But as many other students of ' origins ' follow the same lines of reasoning, though perhaps with greater caution, it seems worth while to examine the principle by which they are guided. This is really nothing but a lineal descend- ant of the old method adopted by the makers of the sun-myth. The meteorologi- cal school believed that some natural or celestial phenomenon was the origin of most of the great divinities of the Aryan races. Their assumption was, no doubt, to some extent well-grounded; for it is of course indisputable that there was a large element of nature-worship at the bottom of Aryan religions. But the adherents of the school fell into discredit because they pressed into the service of their pet theory every myth and every title connected with the god whose natural origin they wished to em- phasize. In other words, they proved too much. Even now, however, although the exaggeration of the sun-myth and the storm-cloud myth is a thing of the past, the principle which produced it appears to flourish. If for 'wind' we read 'sun' or 'dawn,' Dr. Sehrwald's monograph would pass for a typical essay of the sun-myth school. Mythologists of this class forget one very important fact-that, whatever the origin of an Apollo or a Hermes may have been, these gods became humanized at a very early period, of which we can only say that it is prehistoric. It necessarily follows from this that much of the mytho- logy connected with such a god cannot be referred back to his elemental origin, even if (as rarely happens) there is a general agreement upon this question. When the gods had once become anthropomorphic, their worshippers developed conceptions of them as being men and not elements. The jealousy of Hera does not represent the strife of one element with another, as Dr. Sehrwald maintains, but is essentially human; the wife of Zeus has good cause for her hostility to the son of her unfaithful husband. If Leto and Apollo were the only objects of the wrath of Hera, the story might conceivably be explained as an elemental myth; but as her jealousy was continually manifested when Zeus gave occasion for resentment, it is plain that the goddess only feels and acts as a mortal woman might feel and act under similar provocation. Apollo does not found cities because he is the wind, but because he leads his people in their wanderings and presides over their settlements. If he leads them over the sea to form distant colonies, he may easily become the patron of sea-farers. When Dr. Sehrwald attributes these and many other functions of Apollo to a hypo- thetical wind-origin, he makes the elemental god absorb the anthropomorphic god, where- as the whole history of Greek religion proves that the converse was really the case. It is remarkable that even sober and experienced mythologists confuse the primitive with the developed characteristics of a god, in their anxiety to derive every detail from a single head. Dr. Roscher, for example, is convinced that Hermes was originally a wind-god. This theory is very possibly correct; at any rate a wind- Hermes has far more probability than a wind-Apollo. Some apparently primitive aspects in the conception of Hermes may be plausibly explained by this hypothesis, But Dr. Roscher derives all the functions of Hermes from the wind, thus allowing little or no room for the development of the anthropomorphic Hermes. In Arcadia Hermes was the patron of shepherds; and the shepherd was not thinking of any elemental ' origin' when he invented myths and attributes suitable to a shepherd-god. The -pL- y or a sXo' of Hermes was not suggested by the whistling of the wind, as Dr. Roscher supposes, but the pipe or flute of the shepherd himself was transferred to the shepherd's god. We need not see the fertilizing wind in the phallic attributes of Hermes, if we remember that the deity of a pastoral people (whatever his origin) would naturally give increase to the flocks and herds of his worshippers. In fine, we are not justified in arguing to a presupposed 'origin ' from any legend or characteristic of a god, unless there is reasonable evidence that the feature is really primitive and essential, and is not the outcome of purely anthropomorphic development. There is no inherent im- probability in the theory that Hermes was</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. 415 originally the wind, but much of the evidence rests on a false basis; in the case of Apollo there is a very strong inherent improbability, while the evidence brought forward by Dr. Sehrwald is open to the same objection.
