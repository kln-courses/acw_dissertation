<plain_text><page sequence="1">Citation Classics and Foundational Works THE PROMISE OF CONSERVATION BIOLOGY The Professional and Political Challenges of an Explicitly Normative Science WYATT JAMES GAU]SKY Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Michael Soulé 's Conservation Biology helped institutionalize a scientific discipline founded upon normative principles. Maintaining that biodiversity possesses intrinsic value, Conser vation Biology promoted the task of providing mechanisms and influencing policy which would allow for the preservation ofthat diversity. As such, the discipline quickly became the darling of many environmentalists who saw this scientific field as possessing the best of both worlds: the technical acumen and political power of science along with the ethical foresight of environmentalism. Negotiating between those two worlds, however, has not been easy. Today, the foremost challenge facing conservation biology remains balancing scientific legitimacy with political efficacy. Conservation biology also must be careful not to use "nature" to seal off debate on what constitutes the proper role of humans. As such, Soulé's daunting task still remains worth pursuing. Environmentalism has always had a strong affinity for the life and natural sciences. Ecological sciences especially were called on by many envi ronmentalists to provide useful mechanisms or compelling metaphors for under standing and promoting the importance of the natural world (Worster, 1994, p. 344). Historically, notions of harmony, balance, or the stable climax community were invoked to strengthen arguments with regard to the need to shield natural sys tems from human intervention, if for no other reason than enlightened self-interest. However, as so often happens, times and science change. The concept of the healthy natural system as being stable and in balanced harmony fell out of vogue in favor of a form of ecological health marked by perturbations and disturbances (Worster, 1994, p. 417). Environmentalists lost their older scientifically sanctioned, norma tive standby principles. Another was needed, and here is where biodiversity enters environmental discourse. This concept came to represent the existing genetic store house—a wealth of knowledge—waiting to be discovered by humanity. It also could grab some headlines by featuring many really neat animals. Most important, biodiversity provided a new tangible construct to anchor normative scientific con cern for nature and appropriate living. For environmentalists, then, the destruction of biodiversity entered the popular imagination as a meaningful loss. This sentiment was achieved through scientific and emotive argument. When this state of affairs is combined with disgruntled natu ral scientists faced with the loss of their natural subject matter and having no input into actual policy decisions, a new discipline is born: conservation biology.

Soulé. Conservation biology openly accepted a place for values within the discipline of biology, while still stak ing an ongoing claim to the scientific nature of its pursuits. As such, the discipline quickly became the darling of many environmentalists who saw this scientific field as possessing the best of both worlds, the technical acumen and political power of science along with the ethical foresight of environmentalism. Michael Soulé's edited volume, Conservation Biology: The Science of Scarcity and Diversity (1986b), emerged in a flurry of professional activity coming out of the formation of this discipline. The Society of Conservation Biology had just formed a year earlier (1985), and the journal Conservation Biology was to have had its inaugural issue in May 1987. The book itself contains the usual examples of technical work in the field. There are 22 papers grouped in sections titled The Fit ness and Viability of Populations, Patterns of Diversity and Rarity: Their Impor tance for Conservation, and Sensitive Habitats: Threats and Management. Soulé introduces each of the sections by laying out the importance and exploratory nature of this work. Attempts to protect and enhance biodiversity (strengthening popula tions, restoring habitat) were still in the nascent stage at this point. However, the most compelling aspects of the book—the essays that invoke the most hope for environmentalists and the most consternation among scientists—are the bookend sections. The introductory essay (penned by Soulé and titled "Conser vation Biology and the 'Real World'") and the last section (titled "Interacting with the Real World" and including an essay by Arne Naess of the Deep Ecology School) lay out an explicit role for advocacy in the foundational goals of conserva tion biology. The point is to justify the formation of this new discipline or to answer the why question for this discipline's development. After all, conservation biolo gists came from many preestablished disciplines, including ecology, biogeography, systematics, genetics, evolution, epidemiology, sociobiology, and forestry (Soulé, 1986a). Science as usual could easily be practiced within these existing disciplinary boundaries. However, as these practitioners were discovering, a hands-off approach to policy had deleterious effects. Soulé (1986a) notes that many scientists were making gestures toward self-preservation as many of the subjects studied in biological and ecological sciences were being eradicated in a mass extinction pro cess. As a result, scientists found themselves in the position of being constituents or clients for the public policies tied to the environment that directly affected their par ticular research interests. Being removed from their regular domain of scientific expertise and placed in an arena of defending their own livelihoods awakened would-be conservation biolo gists to the need for getting actively involved in the political process. That is, the value of particular species and systems were difficult to define and almost impossi ble to defend in the common rubrics of scientific discourse. Scientists had no recourse in their scientific vocabulary to say why in particular that they just hap pened to love the things they studied. They had gained intimate knowledge of cer tain natural things, but they could not represent themselves as objective scientists in the realm of public policy with the dispassionate aplomb they were used to having and still prove to be relevant voices. As such, conservation biologists hoped to create a scientific discipline that would take an active role in formulating policy despite having no reliable data to back their normative claims. Time was of the essence, so conservation biology is a "discipline with a time limit" (Brussard &amp; Ehrlich, 1992, p. 1). Soulé (1985) called it a "crisis discipline" and played on triage metaphors drawn from discourses in medicine (p. 728). The ordinary rhetorical positioning of science (waiting to report</page><page sequence="3">228 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2000 until a solid and thorough model is developed) had to be forsaken in favor of imme diate action. Otherwise, conservation biology would experience a pyrrhic victory in which the rightness of its cause might only be proven in the absence of the objects for its cause. Although it might not have the ideal theory, conservation biology had to act. Just as a manager must choose in real time between courses of actions, so too did conservation biologists have to commit to certain modes of intervention with the hope that it would maximize their values. There was no notion of rewriting what it meant to do science proper. Rather, the notion is that their science must inform in an active manner, while retaining methodological rigor and predictive ability. What really is important to conservation biologists is that the nonscientific values they hold will prove universal enough to legitimate the scientific endeavors made toward maximizing those ends. Otherwise, there may be nothing left in the environment to value. The discipline, then, was designed to have a specific normative content. Just what are those norms? Soulé ( 1985, pp. 730-731 ) laid out the postulates in an earlier article: • diversity of organisms is good (untimely extinction of populations and spe cies is bad) • ecological complexity is good (like the first one, this postulate expresses a preference for nature over artifice) • evolution is good • biological diversity has intrinsic value (this normative postulate is the most fundamental). The most fundamental postulate, however, also was considered to be at the most risk. Unfortunately for the scientists concerned, this risk was not registering on the political radar. Despite its obviousness to those studying the phenomenon, the trag edy of extinction was continuing unabated. This lack of attention partly was due to the absence of direct impact on humans. Although tangentially related, the loss of biodiversity is not directly linked to the survival of humans. It was seen as a psycho logical risk rather than a physical one because the loss of diversity was seen as lead ing only to a less fully human being instead of a dead one. Identifying the loss of biodiversity as a risk requires the articulation of certain values that would be vio lated by that loss. As a result, conservation biologists charged themselves with not only lessening the risk but also creating the perception that the risk was meaningful to the wider social sphere (by making the risk visible as such). To facilitate this move, the discipline adopted an explicit normative content and embraced a profes sional mandate to play an active advocacy role. With the publication of Conservation Biology, conservation biologists came together as a group to promote the value of diversity and to show how best to do that in their scientific studies. This book also led to calls for greater input into policy processes in an attempt to make a real difference. It was not enough to simply be in a lab, or fieldwork station, taking down data. Conservation biologists instead had to get out and change attitudes, practices, and laws that may affect biodiversity to stem the tide of the ecological crisis. Practitioners were advised in Conservation Biology that both the Nero dilemma (allowing the natural world to disappear by choosing to do nothing rather than advancing a possibly flawed hypothesis) and the bottom-line dilemma (oversimplifying in the face of pressrre by politicians for some definitive answer) should be avoided in the discipline (Soulé, 1986a, pp. 6-7).</page><page sequence="4">Galusky / THE PROMISE OF CONSERVATION BIOLOGY 229 The idea of Conservation Biology was to mobilize various forms of expertise in the natural sciences to serve a particular normative end (the protection of biodiversity). This protection of life, then, becomes the norm that answers the why question for conservation biology. Defense of biodiversity is the reason why the discipline of conservation biology exists, and the pursuit of that defense is necessar ily considered both scientific and political. What becomes an issue is the answer to the how question of conservation biology: How is this preservation to be advanced in the context of being both a science and an advocacy group? In the concluding essay titled "Intrinsic Value: Will the Defenders of Nature Please Rise?" Arne Naess (1986) champions his notion of the scientist advocate. He recognizes the messiness of the public political sphere but concludes (perhaps optimistically) that biologists acting "on the basis of a normative total view" will retain their scientific authority: If they [combine ethics with practical arguments] full of trust in doing the right thing, and without too many strong utterances against the opponents of strong con servation, they are unlikely to be hurt in their capacity as experts and scientists, (p. 515) Thus, the notion that conservation biology could coexist as a form of scientific expertise and political advocacy was made credible in Conservation Biology. The difficulty of the how question is the legacy that the founders of conservation biology left to its practitioners today. The discipline has flourished. Several gradu ate programs offer degrees in conservation biology. The Society for Conservation Biology has more than 15 local chapters nationwide. The journal is entering its 14th year of publication, and biodiversity circulates widely in our popular lexicon. In fact, for better or worse, biodiversity has become a focal point of the environmental movement (Takacs, 1996). The place of advocacy within it, however, remains diffi cult to negotiate and hotly contested. As the need to justify a new science with a meaningful focus has waned, the desire to reify the practice of science as science has sharpened. At stake for conservation biologists is the possibility that the rhetor ical sway of their scientific expertise will be undermined by their explicit bias for preservation. Consequently, scientific information that is "too central, too impor tant, and too desperately needed by society" (Meffe, 1998, p. 741) may be dis missed as emotional rhetoric. Unfortunately, demanding that a conservation biolo gist be both a professional and a political actor does not indicate how such a feat can be accomplished while allowing the scientist to maintain legitimacy. What often occurs instead is a failure to renegotiate the place of scientific knowledge produc tion within the larger political community (one that would make explicit the politi cal nature of all knowledge production), and conservation biologists simply try to wrap themselves in science as such to retain the assumed privileges that science enjoys. Responses to the conundrum created by Conservative Biology typically fall between two poles. One approach expresses the desire to make the traditional scien tific aspects of the discipline (experimental rigor and objective data generation) explicitly distinct from its advocacy responsibilities (e.g., see Murphy, 1990). Oth ers rail against this strict interpretation of the scientific mandate, calling instead for the explicit recognition of values in all parts of the scientific discipline (e.g., see Roebuck &amp; Phifer, 1999). What hinges on the negotiating between the two poles are practices of credibility and legitimation within the scientific world and political responsibilities to the real-world crisis of biodiversity.</page><page sequence="5">230 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2000 Central to this conflict is the fact that by entering the political fray, conservation biologists are forced to make manifest the truths, as values, that they hold to be self-evident. They are forced to defend their right to participate in the process as sci entists, resulting in comments like "despite the fact that conservation biology is an advocacy science, this does not imply that it is less a science than any other" (Matsuda, 1997, p. 1450). Because they explicitly represent a particular interest, conservation biologists must justify how their claims are scientific and not simply emotive (which would carry little weight in the political arena, as their knowledge claims would be leveled with all other nonscientific ones). The most popular strategy involves isolating the practice of the science of con servation biology from its advocacy function. The notion is that although conserva tion biologists may wish to preserve biodiversity, their main contribution to make to the cause is scientific: "Conservation biology should be the science, rather than the conscience, of conservation" (Western, 1989, p. 33). This science is something that is to be done outside the purview of the policy sphere, and it can only be brought into that arena fully formed. As Dennis Murphy (1990) comments, "Conservation biology is not environmental activism... the practice of conservation biology ends where science ends and advocacy begins" (p. 203). What is evident here is a desire to retain the special nature of science. Science is separate from other human endeavors and must be accorded that privileged place. In a series of editorials on the confluence of conservation science and public pol icy, Gary Meffe (1998,1999) (current editor of the journal Conservation Biology) makes this separation very evident, alluding to the niceties of the scientific process and the messiness of the policy process. He discusses the difficulties that scientists may encounter when forced into the political realm, having to negotiate "between what ideally should be done based on the science and what practically can be accomplished based on ugly [italics added] political realities" (Meffe, 1999, p. 463). A clear demarcation exists and must be maintained lest the science become "too compromised [by those ugly political realities] to be recognizable or to pro vide any real good" (Meffe, 1999, p. 463). This distinction between science and policy that Meffe (1998) privileges is critical: The policy process simply does not function [italics added] as science does: logi cal deduction and induction, experimental manipulation of single parameters, determination of relationships among dependent and independent variables, con clusions drawn from objective data analysis, and other such foundations of scien tific thought hold minor importance in a world driven by voter satisfaction, cam paign dollars, demands of constituents, the power of special interests, and political relationships, (p. 742) Science produces legitimate, objective knowledge that can only be soiled in the pol icy process, and conservation biologists must learn to effectively engage this sphere. What emerges out of this approach is the notion that science is distinct from the values circulating in the policy process, and science must remain distinct for it to carry any weight. Values come in only in the political application of that scientific knowledge to public policy. Others in the field feel that values can be admitted into the scientific process. These allowances are made, however, in the context of claiming that all of science is value laden in general. These arguments draw on Thomas Kuhn and Helen Longino to refute positivist notions of what science is or should be (e.g., see Barry &amp;</page><page sequence="6">Galusky / THE PROMISE OF CONSERVATION BIOLOGY 231 Oelschlaeger, 1996). This philosophy of science is used to contradict the notion that science can somehow be value free and not influenced by social factors. Again, legitimation is sought to justify conservation biology as a science that is rigorous and meaningful (i.e., truth seeking). The fact that it provides prescriptions or looks to promote certain values does not make it less scientific because conservation biol ogy can allow for an influence of values in science without diminishing the esteemed value of science. The preservation of biodiversity, then, is postulated on a belief that nature equates to goodness. By appropriating the concept of biodiversity, conservation biology reverts back to portraits of nature that emphasize balance and harmony (Worster, 1994), and nature is stripped of bad connotations; the nature of conserva tion biology is not red in tooth and claw. A particular form of nature has been emphasized in Conservation Biology, and one must recognize that biodiversity is treasured because of these particular beliefs about nature. Normative arguments, as the conservation biologists frequently make them, often rely on back-to-nature sen timents that demand human actions to be more in line with natural processes (e.g., Western, 1989). Hence, natural extinction is okay but anthropomorphic extinction is not (e.g., Soulé, 1985). The natural migration of species is okay but human-intro duced exotics are not. Biodiversity would naturally persist outside of human inter ference so we should let it alone. Moreover, Conservation Biology holds that these preferences are subjective and untestable. As Soulé (1985) claims, "Such a state ment [diversity of organisms is good] cannot be tested or proven. The mechanisms by which such value judgments arise in consciousness are unknown" (p. 730). These values rest on conceptions of nature that exclude visible human presence and instead validate only invisible human interaction mediated through science. Rather than being open and inclusive, then, conservation biology tends to seal off the natu ral world behind a purportedly objective reality. The practitioners of the field become empowered to be both the spokespeople for nature and the arbiters of natu ral conduct by humanity. By defining nature as something that humans now cannot naturally interact with, conservation biology sees a condition in which human action must be mediated through instruction by those that do know. Conservation Biology then argues for relations in which human actions must be sanctioned as nat ural by the experts (the conservation biologist, in this case) so that the actions would be not only the most expedient but also the right way. This creates an epistemological filter that would mediate all ways of knowing through only one way, the natural way. As such, negotiating a proper place for humans within natural systems (not resting on authoritarian scientific prescriptions) remains a major chal lenge to the project of conservation biology. This project, as it was articulated so passionately and forcefully by Michael E. Soulé in Conservation Biology 15 years ago, remains very important within the context of today's environmentalism. Acknowledging values within scientific practice is proving crucial for reintegrating ethical considerations into the produc tion of knowledge and giving voice to concerns that cannot be reduced to concepts of efficiency or exchange. However, in attempting to establish their credibility within the political sphere, conservation biologists must be careful to avoid totalizing solutions and universal prescriptions that might disavow other ethical concerns that environmentalism aims to serve. Values must not be invoked to close off discussion; science must not be invoked to diminish the importance of values. The harmonious marriage of the two in works like Conservation Biology remains a challenge worth taking up.</page><page sequence="7">232 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2000 REFERENCES Barry, D., &amp; Oelschlaeger, M.
