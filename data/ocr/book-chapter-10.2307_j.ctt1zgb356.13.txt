Many of these contact motifs depict  Macassan and 19th- to early 20th-century European ships (Chaloupka 1993:190–205; Taçon  et al. 2010); some are of newly acquired artefacts, such as rifles, knives and Macassan kris, and  horses (May et al. 2013; Wesley 2013); others depict events from the 1880 gold rush in Pine  Creek to the west of the plateau (Chinese miners; e.g. Edwards 1979); still others show themes  relating to the Second World War (aeroplanes, Darwin wharf; Chaloupka 1993).  By contrast, the southern half of the Arnhem Land plateau is relatively poorly known. In 2005,  the Jawoyn Association began to promote the systematic recording of rock art within Jawoyn  lands in central-western to southwestern Arnhem Land, at first through the Jawoyn Rock Art and  Heritage Project (JRAHP, 2005–2012) (Gunn and Whear 2007), followed in 2010 by a program  of archaeological excavation and rock art dating (e.g. David et al. 2011; Geneste et al. 2012).  These studies have focused on the little-studied rock art sites of Jawoyn lands, mostly but not  exclusively on the Arnhem Land plateau itself (Figure 9.1). Here, the rock paintings revealed  a wide array of artistic conventions in many cases much akin to those of the better-known  northwestern parts of Arnhem Land, although across Jawoyn lands only seven sites have yet been  seen to contain imagery depicting identifiable European or Asian contact themes (see below).  This paucity of Western-contact imagery is despite what has arguably been the most intensive,  systematic rock art recording project yet undertaken anywhere in Arnhem Land, and the largest  database of rock art sites for any single region within the Arnhem Land plateau (Table  9.1;  Figure 9.2).  </page> <page sequence="4"> 166    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia This chapter explores this incongruity in the distribution of Western-contact motifs contrasting  northwestern and southwestern Arnhem Land in relation to the rich corpus of other kinds of  rock art on the plateau. We stress from the onset that while images of ‘Western-contact art’  derive from a wide variety of responses to outsider influences, and include imagery that employs  conventions akin and often indistinguishable to those of the pre–Western contact period, in  this chapter we restrict our discussion to images of introduced objects and demonstrably foreign  peoples.

Djurray: A major contact imagery site on the Arnhem  Land plateau May et al. (2013:52) suggest that contact rock art need not be found only in the immediate  area where cross-cultural meetings took place. Like traded objects, information regarding cross- cultural encounters spreads quickly through wide-ranging social networks. People themselves  commonly travelled across social boundaries, enabling new information to rapidly reach faraway  places. Indeed the greatest number of demonstrably Western-contact images in Jawoyn lands  occurs at Djurray (Jawoyn site ARN-088/6), a rock art site with maritime motifs some 150 km  inland from the coast and separated from it by some of the most rugged terrain on the plateau  and, more significantly, by lands that are not Jawoyn. The Djurray site is at the northern limit  of Jawoyn lands, although its Jawoyn ownership is contested by an adjacent group. Margaret  Katherine (pers. comm. 2011), the senior Jawoyn Traditional Owner for the lands immediately  to the south, terms Djurray a ‘shared site’ between herself and her northern neighbours. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="6"> 168    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia The Djurray shelter is large, 23 m wide across its mouth, 6 m deep from overhang to back  wall and 8 m high at the outer edge of the overhang. The shelter is open with a high rear  wall that is extensively decorated with over 300 rock art images (both recent and older-looking  paintings, stencils, prints and drawing), seven of which are depictions of European-contact  objects (Table 9.1). The artwork at the shelter is dominated by a large white painting, Boat A  (1.67 m long × 0.89 m high), with a crew of six wearing broad-brimmed European-style hats  standing alongside square waist-high ‘crates’ (Figure 9.3). On the panel below the white boat are  the three smaller Boats B–D, also in white, with hatless crews, triangular sails and steering oars  (Figure 9.4). Below these again, there is Boat E, a three-masted vessel in yellow and red (Figure  9.5), in a relatively poor state of preservation caused by passing animals rubbing the pigment  away. Two metres to the right of this group of images is Boat F, also large and with a square sail  and a crew of two (one wearing heeled boots), the ensemble of artworks painted in white and red  with an unusual white-dotted infill (Figure 9.6). Boat F is partially superimposed by Boat G, a  small white sailing boat with a long rope line and anchor (Figure 9.6). Figure 9.3 Boat A, site ARN-088/6. Scale 10 cm.

The larger vessel (Boat A; Figure 9.3) is most similar to either a three-masted schooner from  the pearling industry or a river barge. The three smaller vessels (Boats B–D; Figure 9.4) are  reminiscent of ocean-going sail canoes, schooners or coastal shunters (Paul Clark, pers. comm.  2010; David Steinberg, pers. comm. 2012). Those three smaller vessels exhibit features such as  steering paddles/oars that suggest a non-European and non–south Sulawesi (Macassan) origin,  with possible southern New Guinea or Tanimbar Islands (Maluku province east of Sulawesi)  connections (Paul Clark, pers. comm. 2012).  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="8"> 170    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia When visiting the site in 2008, the late Wamud Nadjamerrek, a senior Elder and rock art painter  with close associations with Jawoyn lands (see Nadjamerrek et al. 2010), suggested that the boats  at the Djurray shelter may have been painted as ‘postcards’ by visitors from the north coast of  Arnhem Land to show Jawoyn people what they had seen (Wamud Nadjamerrek, pers. comm.  to Ray Whear 2008). Given the many fine details of people and items of material culture in  the paintings, the painter(s) themselves appear to have had considerable direct knowledge of  the watercraft and their uses, reflecting their own personal experiences of having seen those  vessels themselves rather than retelling second-hand knowledge. The depiction of the vessels is  not entirely naturalistic, with some key features (such as the shape of the sails) being inaccurate  and depicted in a non-functional manner (Adrian Horridge, pers. comm. 2012). This suggests  that the boats were seen at a distance, perhaps in harbour, rather than the artist having knowledge  of how they worked. Interestingly, Wamud Nadjamerrek showed greater interest in a pair of  clap sticks shelved within a rock crevice at this site than in the boat paintings. Here, as at other  Jawoyn art sites visited on this and other occasions, Wamud Nadjamerrek engaged more with  the traditional images with which he could directly relate through his knowledge of cosmology  or ceremony. The boat images at the Djurray shelter are not the most recent paintings wit hin this shelter, as  two have been partially superimposed by large fish-like creatures in white with red outline and  infill, one of which has X-ray features (Figure 9.6). The fish-like creature with the X-ray infill  is painted in a similar manner to, and is similarly well-preserved as, a nearby large barramundi  motif depicted with the classic X-ray form. The other fish-like creature has a spotted infill  (sprayed dots); at the instruction of Wamud Nadjamerrek (pers. comm. to Robert Gunn 2008),  it is not illustrated here due to its cultural sensitivities. For this chapter, this motif is simply  termed the ‘spotted fish’. Hence, the X-ray form of painting was being used here during the  European-contact period. Similarly, Boat F has been superimposed by a large ‘Jawoyn Lady’  motif (Gunn 1992) in white with red and black infill (Figure 9.6), indicating that the ‘Jawoyn  Lady’ motif type was also produced within the European-contact period. The anchor of the small  sail boat (Boat G; Figure 9.6) passes neatly around the feet of the ‘Jawoyn Lady’ motif and over  one of her toes, indicating that the anchor was added to the panel after the ‘Jawoyn Lady’ figure  was painted. At some later time, as determined by patterns of superimposition, a white-infilled  oval area – possibly a headdress or puff of tobacco smoke? – was added to the booted figure on  Boat F (Figure 9.6). Comparable degrees of preservation suggest a range of other traditional  motif types were also painted after Boats F and G were painted. Together, these patterns of  superimposition and states of preservation suggest that the painting of traditional motifs at the  Djurray shelter continued well into the European-contact period. A pattern of X-ray paintings  overlying European-contact motifs was also observed in the Wellington Range, 200 km to the  north of Djurray and closer to the coast (Taçon et al. 2010:61). Other European contact–period images Seven other images referencing European contact–period items of material culture or considered  to represent European-contact events have been located from six rockshelters in Jawoyn lands.  These seven paintings consist of two of European people, a horse with rider, a horse without  rider, a bullock with a neck-bell and two of metal-headed axe/hoes (Figures 9.7–9.14, 13.33). One of the European figures (Figure 9.7) was painted in white on the rear wall of a shallow  rockshelter, ARN-107/3. The person, 31 cm tall, wears a top hat and leans to their right, as  if leaning casually against some unportrayed object. Despite standing with hands on hips, the  person does not strike the forceful pose usually attributed to such a stance (Ouzman 2003:14).  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="9"> 9.  Postcards from the outside    171  Aboriginal people across much of Australia characteristically used such a pose to depict European  men (e.g.  see also May et al. 2013:50). The pose is also depicted on the crew of Boat A at  Djurray, 20 km to the northwest of ARN-107/3 (see above). The ARN-107/3 hatted person is  positioned centrally on a vertical panel between two larger macropod paintings in a traditional  style (Figure 9.7). Both macropod images were painted in white with red outline and infill that,  from differences in pigment preservation, appear to pre-date the hatted person. The macropod to  the right of the panel, however, shows evidence of repainting as water-wash across the legs reveals  the original underpainting with the red outline. The repainting was in a similar monochrome  white to the hatted person, and both whites are similarly preserved. This suggests that the painting  of the hatted person and the repainting of the macropod are contemporaneous. No  further  paintings were added to this panel following these two white paintings. The presence of other,  better preserved monochrome white paintings of traditional motifs in adjacent shelters, however,  suggests either that the hatted person at ARN-107/3 was painted during a phase of artistic activity  that included other nearby rockshelters that provide better protection for their rock art, or that  the hatted person was not the most recent image painted within this site complex.

A second human figure, arguably of the contact period and also painted in white (Figure 9.8),  occurs in shelter ARN-019/M some 10 km east of Djurray. That figure is 70 cm tall and was  painted on the underside of a rock ledge of an undercut rock wall 1.5 m above the floor.  The painting is not visible from more than c. 1 m away. Here the human figure appears to be  wearing a drooping hat (pith helmet?) of a shape not usually seen in the art of this region, and  is holding a white bar across his hips. The shape of the bar (tapering from left to right) and the  manner in which it is held suggest a rifle. This motif is one of seven white paintings in a similar  state of preservation within the shelter; they are probably contemporaneous. None of the other  six white paintings on an adjacent panel depict recognisably European-contact motifs.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="10"> 172    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia At the remarkable and profusely decorated  rockshelter site of Nawarla Gabarnmang  (ARN-074/A), some 10 km to the south of  Djurray, a large painting of a horse has been  placed across a flat ceiling panel (Gunn et al.  2012a:61). The horse painting measures  3.5 × 2.4 m, on a multi-layered painted panel  4.7 × 3.3 m. Much of the horse is obscured  by overlying, more recent paintings, but its  overall shape can be tracked by connecting  those parts of the horse that extend beyond  the superimposing images, including its  well-defined head, back and tail (Figure 9.9).  The horse was painted with an unusual infill  pattern; initially it was painted in a grey  pigment, then outlined in white and then  again in red. When completed, the painting  would have been visually striking and readily  apparent by anyone using the shelter. The many  superimpositions on that panel (Figure 9.10)  indicate that the horse was later overlain by  at least four layers of paint represented by 17  paintings, including a number of X-ray fish  and traditional Jawoyn-style anthropomorphs.  The horse painting itself overlies another eight,  and therefore older, layers of paint representing  some 50 paintings of standard traditional  Jawoyn motif types (such as macropods, ‘spirit’  figures, fish, turtle and hand stencils). None  of the motifs under the horse are depicted in  X-ray. This sequence of superimpositions at  Nawarla Gabarnmang, as with those involving  European boats and more traditional motif  forms at Djurray (see above), indicates the  Figure 9.8 European figure with floppy hat and incorporation and articulation of new and  carrying a long object (rifle?), site ARN-019/M. traditional elements in the production of  Source: Photograph by Robert Gunn. rock art over the European-contact period  beginning with Leichhardt’s travels across  Arnhem Land in 1845 (cf.

The alcove is one of three conjoined alcoves that constitute the 70 m long shelter, which  is prolifically decorated with over 600 images – mostly rows of small stick-figures – in all its  alcoves. The horse-and-rider painting is 54 cm long. Along with many of the other images within  this shelter, the horse-and-rider painting can only be viewed by lying on the floor beneath the  ledge. The rider wears a broad, drooping hat similar to the one on the white figure at ARN- 019/M described above (Figure 9.8). A pair of reins, held by the rider, is clearly depicted and  the criss-cross lines over the head appear to signify a halter, but no saddle is represented. The  horse here has short front legs and longer hind legs, a kind of depiction more commonly seen on  traditional paintings of macropods. The employment of this kind of macropod schema on early  representations of horses was previously noted by Chaloupka (1993:195–196) for areas to the  north of the plateau, to the north of Jawoyn lands. At ARN-087/1, the horse’s tail was originally  painted to curl between the hind legs, but was later repainted (i.e. corrected) to the standard  tassel-like tail used on many other early contact paintings of horses elsewhere in Arnhem Land  (Chaloupka 1993:200; Flood 1997:316; Lewis 1988:411; Murdoch 2009:1).

Postcards from the outside    175  Dalakngalarr 1 (ARN-082/1), 25 km east of Djurray, is another prolifically decorated shelter,  with over 700 paintings. Two of the paintings are of metal-headed axe/hoes (see Figure 13.33).  Both have typical swayed handles and large angular heads (see Figures 13.33B and 13.33D).  The axe is painted in yellow with a purple outline and patterned infill, while the hoe is in plain  yellow. Both axe/hoes are on the same outer wall section, to one side of the main occupation  area, and superimpose at least one layer of earlier and considerably more faded red and yellow  paintings. The colours and style of the axe at ARN-082/1 (see Figures 13.33A and 13.33B) are  similar to those of a suite of adjacent X-ray fish paintings (Figure 9.15), suggesting that the axe  is contemporaneous with the fish paintings. It also suggests that the X-ray paintings here, like  the stylistically similar ones at Nawarla Gabarnmang, are a European-contact period addition to  the shelter (see also Chapters 11 and 13).  Figure 9.13 X-ray fish (barramundi and saratoga) painted with colours similar to those used on the  axe painting, site ARN-082/1 (Dalakngalarr 1). Scale 10 cm. Source: Photograph by Robert Gunn. The best preserved of the European-contact motifs on the plateau within Jawoyn lands is that  of a bullock with neck-bell (Figure 9.13). It occurs on the rear wall of shelter ARN-031/1,  towards the southern end of the plateau (Figure 9.2). The shelter is 28 m long and contains 360  mostly small paintings. The bullock is 67 cm long and painted with a white outline and striped  infill, some of which has been discoloured by underlying yellow paintings. The bullock image is  positioned centrally on a vertical panel and is one of the largest and clearest of the paintings in  the shelter. Consequently, like the large boat (Boat A) at Djurray (see above), the bullock is the  most notable image at ARN-031/1 (Figure 9.14). The bullock here appears to have been painted  contemporaneously with an eel-tailed catfish (Tandanus tandanus) to its immediate right, where  a similar pigment has been used; that eel-tailed catfish image is also outlined and stripe-infilled,  with the two images being similarly well preserved. The eel-tailed catfish is 115 cm long and is  positioned horizontally facing the bullock. Both the bullock and the catfish superimpose an array  of poorly preserved white and yellow monochrome and white and red bichrome paintings, all of  which overlie several layers of very faint red paintings. This sequence of superimpositions indicates  that the bullock and the catfish are the final motifs painted on this panel. Their noticeably better  state of preservation makes it likely that they were the last painted within the site complex.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="14"> 176    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 9.14 Bullock with bell panel, site ARN-031/1.

Overlying art Sixteen paintings, interpretable to motif type, have been recorded superimposed over European- contact motifs in Jawoyn lands (Table 9.2). These overlying paintings give an indication of  artistic conventions demonstrably used during the period following initial European contact.  The presence of X-ray fish and ‘Jawoyn Lady’ motifs over the contact motifs, and their absence  below, indicate that they were part of the ensemble of artistic practices that followed initial  European contact. While polychrome colouring may also be a feature of the rock art following  initial European contact in Jawoyn lands, bichrome motifs also occur below, and hence precede,  the production of the horse motif at Nawarla Gabarnmang. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="15"> 9.  Postcards from the outside    177  Chemistry of white pigments from Boat A, the ‘Jawoyn Lady’ and a large  spotted fish at Djurray site ARN-088/6: Identifying painting events  Three small samples of white pigment were easily detached with the tip of a metal blade from  Boat A, the ‘Jawoyn Lady’ and a large spotted fish to the left of Boat A (the latter cannot be  shown for Jawoyn cultural reasons) at Djurray site ARN-088/6. The ‘Jawoyn Lady’ overlies  Boat  F, a demonstrably contact motif (see above for relationship to Boat G). We undertook  specialist chemistry on the three detached samples to determine whether they were all painted  with a single paint paste that would implicate a single painting event, or whether multiple events  are more likely, as a means of further investigating the longevity of artistic practice into the  period of European contact. The three samples of white pigment were each examined under optical microscopy, revealing fine  powder and clusters of powder grains (Table 9.3). Scanning Electron Microscope with Energy  Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), using a LEO Stereoscan 440 SEM with a Brucker  SDD X-FLASH 4030 EDS, indicates a crystalline structure of small plates for the Jawoyn Lady  and spotted fish samples (Figures 9.16A and 9.16B). The plates of the spotted fish sample are  composed mainly of Al and Si (at 1:1 ratio; Figure 9.16D). Specific alumino-silicate bands  observed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR, using a Nicolet 380 spectrometer  at 400–4000 cm-1, 2 cm-1 resolution, 64 scans), indicate that each sample consists of kaolinite  (Al2Si2O5(OH)4) (Figure 9.16C).

The presence of small, 10–15 μm long needle-like spicules of S-Ca in the ‘Jawoyn Lady’ and  spotted fish samples is attributed to a calcium sulphate phase, probably indicating the presence  of gypsum in stable, dry conditions. The presence of calcium sulphate could be due to natural  precipitation on the wall, or anthropic mixing with the kaolinite pigment either to create  a paint paste, or it could be unintentional as the kaolinite paint interacted with the surface of  the rock wall. The weak presence of this calcium sulphate phase suggests a natural inclusion  (i.e. contamination of the kaolinite) rather than anthropic mixing of components (i.e. intentional  creation of a paint paste from multiple components). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="16"> 178    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Table 9.3 Description of the pigment samples from Djurray site ARN-088/6.

Postcards from the outside    179  The ‘Jawoyn Lady’ and spotted fish samples exhibit large amounts of P in association with Al,  probably signalling an alumino-phosphate phase associated with weathering of the quartzite rock  wall on which the paintings were undertaken. Larger crystals of quartz (SiO2) are only detected in the spotted fish sample. The quartz crystals  probably came from the underlying rock rather than from the pigment. The composition of  the spotted fish pigment sample differs a little from those of the other two pigment samples.  This chemical difference in pigments may indicate either that the white paint from the spotted  fish was prepared on a different occasion to that of Boat A and the ‘Jawoyn Lady’, or that different  mixtures of paint paste were used contemporaneously on the different paintings. In addition, each  of the three pigment samples exhibits its own unique combination of impurities (Mg, K, Fe),  suggesting multiple origins for the kaolinite pigment.  In summary, despite the common presence of kaolinite, the white pigments used to paint Boat A,  the ‘Jawoyn Lady’ and the spotted fish each contain a different chemical signature, suggesting  different combinations of elements and thus the use of different paint pastes or ‘paint pots’  (Chalmin et al. 2003). We cannot, therefore, confirm whether the three paintings imply a single  painting event, as it is possible that the artist(s) had more than one paint paste with them during  a single painting event, or whether the paintings were made on different occasions.  The initial munanga contact period in Jawoyn lands The Jawoyn terms for non-Aboriginal people are munanga or mam (literally, ‘devil’ and/or ‘white  person’; Merlan and Jacq 2005). For several centuries prior to the European colonisation of  Australia, Macassan sailors came annually to the northern coast of Arnhem Land to collect and  process trepang (MacKnight 1972, 1986; Mitchell 1994; Mulvaney 1975; Taçon et al. 2010;  Wesley et al. 2016). The extent of direct contact that inland groups such as the Jawoyn would  have had with coastal mariners some 150 km to the northwest, if any, is unknown. Similarly,  although British coastal outposts were established in 1827 at Fort Wellington (1827–1829) and  in 1838 at Port Essington (1838–1849) – both to the northwest of the Arnhem Land plateau –  direct contact between Jawoyn and Europeans, or between Jawoyn and European animals such as  horses and cattle, probably did not begin until Ludwig Leichhardt crossed the plateau from the  southeast to the northwest in 1845 (Figure 9.17; Leichhardt 1847). Leichhardt’s party travelled  up the Flying Fox Creek valley that drains the southeastern side of the plateau on 1 November  1845. He noted in his journal that his party came across numerous Aboriginal camps and that he  attempted to converse with and give gifts (such as brass buttons, horse-nails and a broken girth  strap) to Aboriginal people whenever the chance arose (e.g. Leichhardt 1847:3 November 1845).  Leichhardt and his party passed within 15 km southwest of Djurray and within 20 km southwest  of Nawarla Gabarnmang (see Figure 9.17). Following an Aboriginal footpath beside the Roper  River, to the south and southeast of the plateau, Leichhardt noted that ‘cuts on various trees were  made with an iron tomahawk’ (Leichhardt 1847:19 October 1845) and, later, that while local  Aboriginal people had seen or heard of ‘white’ people, they were much afraid of his party’s horses  and bullocks (Leichhardt 1847:22 October 1845). Subsequent to Leichhardt’s expedition, further exploration of the plateau by Europeans during  the 1800s was limited. In July 1862, J.M. Stuart passed through western Jawoyn Country in the  southwestern corner of the plateau, but his party was wary of local Aboriginal people and only  once did they exchange friendly greetings (Hardman 1865:25 June 1862). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="18"> 180    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 9.17 Early European travels on and around the Arnhem Land plateau. Leichhardt, Stuart, McKinlay  and Lindsay’s routes are plotted from maps and textual details in the explorers’ published journals. Source: Kara Rasmanis. Four years later, J.M. McKinlay traversed the base of the northwestern escarpment (Australian  Dictionary of Biography 1974; Davis 1863). Although McKinlay did not enter Jawoyn Country,  doubtless his proximity would have been noticed by neighbouring groups and widely discussed. In October 1883, David Lindsay, a government surveyor, was commissioned by the South  Australian Government to assess the potential of eastern and central Arnhem Land for European  settlement. Travelling by horse, Lindsay’s party followed the Roper River from near the township  of Katherine eastward around the south side of the plateau to the coast, deviating only to explore  the upper reaches of the Wilton River. Cutting across the eastern, inland side of Arnhem Land  they headed north to present-day Ramingining, west to the Liverpool River and then southwest  over the plateau to the Katherine River, which they then followed downstream to the fledgling  Katherine township (initially established as the Katherine Telegraph Station in 1872) (Figures 9.1  and 9.17). Lindsay was generally favourably disposed towards Aboriginal people and attempted  to make peaceful contact with those he met, giving tobacco and small items (axes, fishing hooks  and lines) in return for collecting word lists and receiving travel directions (Lindsay 1884).  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="19"> 9.  Postcards from the outside    181  During two encounters, however – one near the mouth of the Roper River and one at Blue Mud  Bay to the east of the Arnhem Land plateau – his party was attacked by armed warriors; Lindsay’s  party resorted to firearms to repel the assaults (McKinlay’s party had also been threatened, on the  East Alligator River).  Lindsay also mentions, and in some cases carefully describes, Aboriginal activities such as fishing  and landscape-burning, as well as noting campsites, burial grounds and the location of stone  quarries. From his notes, it is clear that the Roper River valley and the area around Ramingining  were well populated by Aboriginal groups. Of the Roper River valley, which passes through  southern Jawoyn lands, Lindsay writes: ‘These evidences of an immense number of natives  testifies to the excellence of the country’ (Lindsay 1884:4). Despite his observations elsewhere,  Lindsay makes no mention of seeing any people or campsite when crossing over the plateau on  his return trip. It can be deduced from this lack of observations that the plateau was sparsely  populated at that time. Whether this lack of encounters with Aboriginal people was due to  the position of his route (which, to save his horses, deliberately avoided those areas where rock  outcrops and rockshelters were densest), the effects of depopulation through earlier epidemics, or  to the time of year (end of the dry season in October, when surface water is sparse) is unknown.  Lindsay’s party passed within 15 km of Djurray and 10 km south of the ARN-107 site complex,  two key locations discussed in this chapter. With possible relevance for the paintings of horses  at Nawarla Gabarnmang and the nearby ARN-087 site complex, it is of interest to note that the  Aboriginal people Lindsay met near the western side of the Gulf of Carpentaria to the east of  Jawoyn Country ‘could speak a little English, were not afraid of us, but professed great fear of the  horses and dogs’ (Lindsay 1884:5). On another occasion, near the mouth of the Roper River,  three of Lindsay’s horses were speared by local Aborigines using spears tipped with either stone  points or wire skewers. Before Lindsay could retrieve the wounded horses, one had been killed  and disembowelled and his neck-bell taken (Lindsay 1884:6); during this early period when  horses were first introduced into Arnhem Land, they were an object of keen interest to local  Aboriginal groups. Contact with munanga intensified with the completion of the overland telegraph line and the  establishment of a repeater station near the present town of Katherine in 1872. The period  between 1870 and 1890 also saw a rapid increase in the number of non-Aboriginal Australians,  western Europeans and Chinese entering the western and southern sections of Jawoyn Country,  as pastoral settlements became established and mineral exploration and gold-mining began  (Levitus 1995:68–69, 74). Although few such intrusions were made onto the plateau, the pastoral  industry isolated traditional waterholes and food reserves on surrounding lands, forcing local  Aboriginal peoples to more or less rely on cattle stations, mines and/or market-gardens for labour  and provisions to survive, at least seasonally. These places of work and access to resources became  the foci of settlement for labourers and their families and, consequently, for the development  of fringe camps. The presence of debilitating drugs such as opium, tobacco and alcohol, and  often-rampant new diseases such as yaws and smallpox proved catastrophic, greatly reducing  the population and thereby destroying or altering elements of culture, such as site-specific rites  that required sizable gatherings for prolonged periods. By 1939, the Aboriginal population over  most of the northern part of the Northern Territory, including the entire Arnhem Land plateau,  had decreased dramatically, with estimated reductions of more than 95 per cent for each of  the Alligator River region to the north and Victoria River region to the southwest of Jawoyn  Country (Keen 1980; Rose 1992; Smith 1994:46). Following the Japanese bombing of Katherine  in 1942, the Arnhem Land plateau was largely depopulated of Jawoyn and other Aboriginal  groups through enforced resettlement into government compounds that later developed into  residential communities, such as Rockhole at Katherine and small townships such as Barunga  (Merlan 1998:5). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="20"> 182    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia European contact–period occupation of the plateau ‘European contact’ does not refer to a single period of time shared by all Aboriginal peoples across  Australia. It, and its consequent effects on Aboriginal people, began at various times across the  continent, depending on the timing of the expansion of European exploration and settlement.  For the Guringai people of the Sydney region, initial European contact was in 1770 AD and  then again in 1788 AD (McDonald 2008:16–22), while for some Western Desert groups initial  European contact was not until around 1870 AD (Thompson 1975:x). For many Jawoyn, the  European-contact period began in 1845 AD with Leichhardt’s expedition across the plateau  (above), that first phase of contact concluding with the development of local pastoral and  mining industries in the 1890s. A second phase of contact in Jawoyn lands can be identified  from 1890 AD to the depopulation of the plateau in the 1940s. By the 1950s, the Maranboy tin  mines had ceased production and most Jawoyn people from the plateau were now living in fringe  camps around the towns and settlements off the plateau (Cooke 2009). Nevertheless, despite this  broad exodus in the 1940s, Aboriginal people tell of continued movements across the region and  of small numbers making prolonged visits to the plateau in the 1950s (Wamud Nadjamerrek and  Margaret Katherine, pers. comm. 2006, 2010). Archaeologically, such a continued presence on  the plateau is evident through at least two European-contact objects found in plateau rockshelters  on Jawoyn lands: a decayed suitcase from site ARN-129/3 (Figure 9.18), likely to date to the  first half of the 20th century; and a glass ‘cat’s-eye’ marble (Figure 9.19) from site ARN-091/20a.  Suitcases with similar catches to those at ARN-129/3 were being produced by 1911, and cat’s-eye  marbles began to be produced in the 1930s, gaining popularity in the 1940s and flooding the  market in the 1950s. The glass marble could indicate occupation or visitation to the site in the  1930s or early 1940s, more likely in the post–World War II period after 1945 AD.

At Nawarla Gabarnmang (site ARN-074/A), the site with the large horse painting (see above),  only one portable item of material culture demonstrably originating from non-Aboriginal sources  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="22"> 184    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia has been found on the surface or in archaeological excavations: a blue glass bead 2.30 × 2.56 mm.  The bead came from XU1 of excavation Square J, within the top 1.1 cm of sediment. Trade items  were commonly carried by early European explorers travelling across northern Australia including  Arnhem Land, although we do not know if they carried trade beads. As Wesley and Litster  (2015) have noted, however, trade beads were present on the coast as currencies in Aboriginal– Macassan–European economies well before the first European explorers of the Arnhem Land  plateau, and could thus have entered Jawoyn Country through northern Aboriginal interactions  and movements. The absence of any known non-Aboriginal portable object other than the glass  bead at Nawarla Gabarnmang indicates that the excavated bead was almost certainly deposited  during the early (rather than later) European-contact period, and is likely to either precede,  or to be broadly contemporaneous with, the horse painting located some 9 m to the southeast of  Square J. Furthermore, of the 43 accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates from  near-surface charcoal dating to the past c. 400 years at Nawarla Gabarnmang (including from  the area where the glass bead was found), not a single one exhibits evidence of the ‘bomb pulse’  (see below). The charcoal from the most recent campfires within the site thus almost certainly  always pre-date 1945 AD (by an unknown number of decades).  Artefacts made from organic material such  as plant fibre or wood are unlikely to survive  for any extended period of time in Arnhem  Land due to the acidic nature of the soils,  the prevalence of termites and moulds, the  scavenging activities of fauna (small to medium- sized mammals including dingoes, goannas,  and birds), the high wet season rainfall, and  the regular bushfires in the dry season (many  initiated by the Jawoyn in the management of  Country). Not surprisingly, therefore, most  of the more recent artefacts recovered from  rockshelters in Jawoyn lands, such as painted  burial poles, ochred string, plant fibre bags and  cloth pieces (e.g. Figures 9.23 and 9.24) come  from sites close to European-period settlements  located around the southern rim of the plateau,  Figure 9.20 Small metal billy-can from the such as Barunga.

Although few such surface cultural features have been encountered so far, the  results are instructive. All bar one of these hearths are located within rockshelters; the exception  is a hearth from an eroding creek bank at the ARN-079 rock art site complex (Table 9.6).  Installations and portable items of material culture found on the surface of sites have also been  radiocarbon-dated with these same aims in mind, including two canine bundle burials (Gunn  et  al. 2010, 2012b), a plant fibre dillybag (Figure 9.23), and four wooden items of material  culture (Figure 9.25; see below). Direct radiocarbon dating of apparently relatively recent rock  art has also been undertaken, in particular of beeswax figures (Gunn and Whear 2008). The testing of atomic bombs in the 1950s and  early 1960s significantly increased the amount,  and proportion, of 14C in the atmosphere, so  that radiocarbon dates with very high levels of  14C exceeding the 1955 levels exhibit evidence  of the ‘bomb pulse’, and can be used to date  post-1955 samples to within six months’  precision (e.g. see Wilson et al. 2001). It is  significant that none of the radiocarbon dates  from objects on the plateau in Jawoyn lands  exhibit the bomb pulse. Of the six surface  and near-surface hearths dated, the two most  recent calibrate to sometime within the period  1693–1956 AD at 68.3 per cent probability,  but most probably within the mid-1800 to  early 1900s; so they almost certainly either pre- date the European-contact period or date to its  early phase prior to depopulation of the plateau  by 1942. Similarly, both canine burials have  a higher probability of calibrating to within the  Figure 9.25 Non-European artefacts made of period 1877–1917 AD, again signalling ages of  wood.

The youngest five radiocarbon-dated beeswax  images, similarly, all have highest probability  peaks in the 18th and 19th centuries. Thus,  all the cultural items investigated because they  might be of very recent age are most likely of  the early European-contact period or earlier,  indicating a paucity or absence of traces of  occupation into more recent times (Table 9.6). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="25"> 9.

Postcards from the outside    189  The distribution of these artefacts and dates across Jawoyn lands on the plateau (Figure 9.26)  reveals evidence of people using rock art sites during the early European-contact period.  The  paucity of European-contact motifs relating to this early contact period cannot be seen  simply as a reduction in population numbers. Nor can it be due to a reduction in artistic output  over this same time frame, as well shown for example by the heavy superimpositioning at ARN- 074/A when output increases and images become bigger and are more polychrome. The evidence  indicates that Aboriginal people remained numerous over many decades on the plateau during  the early European-contact period. An explanation is called for other than rapid depopulation  close to the initial period of contact.  Figure 9.26 Distribution of European-contact period and organic artefacts in Jawoyn lands. Source: Kara Rasmanis. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="28"> 190    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Discussion To date, 1079 rock art sites have been recorded from 127 site complexes in Jawoyn lands (including  the plateau and surrounding uplands). Of these, only the seven reported here (0.6 per cent of  sites) contain European-contact motifs of a kind discussed in this chapter (Figure 9.2). While  a total survey of Jawoyn rock art sites is far from complete – we estimate that Jawoyn lands  probably contain well over 1000 site complexes – the spatial patterning of European-contact  imagery and portable items of material culture are based on extensive surveys covering the length  and width of Jawoyn lands, and are thus considered to be representative of the region as a whole.  In the Wellington Range 150 km to the north of Jawoyn lands and 30 km from the coast,  paintings of boats account for 50 per cent of the non-Aboriginal-contact images (May et al.  2013:48), but paintings of European-contact objects occur in only 5 per cent of a sample of  c. 150 sites (May et al. 2010:63, Figure 12). Hence, even in areas with close interactions with  several waves of non-Aboriginal people (e.g. Macassan, European), contact motifs identifiably  depicting contact events, personages and themes do not feature prominently in the rock art.  The considerably lower proportion of contact motifs within Jawoyn lands is not surprising, given  the relative paucity of interactions between Jawoyn people and outsiders over the period from  1845 to the turn of the 19th century and even later. Consequently, the dearth of contact motifs in  Jawoyn lands can be directly attributed to a paucity of direct interactions with outsiders and the  relatively minor direct intervention intruders had on traditional Jawoyn life during this period  prior to depopulation of the Arnhem Land plateau (the devastating effects of introduced diseases  such as yaws and smallpox notwithstanding). Our work has found that European-contact motifs appear to be clustered in two general  locations of the plateau in Jawoyn lands: six sites on the upper reaches of the Katherine River,  and one site on the upper Waterhouse River (Figure 9.2). All but two are within large and well- decorated rockshelters (Table 9.7). The exceptional two, ARN-019/M and ARN-103/1, each  contains a single image of what appear to be European men; indeed, they are the only locations  where Europeans appear other than on depictions of boats. The images in the Katherine River  headwaters can be subdivided on subject and stylistic grounds into three groups:  1. The standing figure at ARN-107/3 (Figure 9.7) and the figures on the large boat painting  at ARN-088/6 (Boat A) (Figure 9.3) 17 km to the northwest, all of which share similar  pigment colour, headwear (broad-brimmed European style hat), paint application (thickness  of line work) and the body proportions of the figures.  2. The human figure painted in white at ARN-019/M (Figure 9.8), and the mounted red figure  at ARN-087/1 (Figure 9.12), which both wear similar headwear (pith-helmets?) and, hence,  probably relate to a similar period of time (or perhaps even to the same person or event). 3. The singular large polychrome horse motif at ARN-074/A (Figure 9.9). Table 9.7 Sites with European-contact imagery on the plateau in Jawoyn lands.

Postcards from the outside    191  The images at ARN-087/1 (Figure 9.12) and ARN-074/A (Figure 9.9) are stylistically different  from both each other and all other contact images within Jawoyn lands. The horse representations  at these two sites are in very different styles and sizes. As the portrayal of the ARN-087/1 horse  is truer to the active use of horses by people (e.g. presence of rider, reins) than is that of ARN- 074/A, the ARN-087/1 artist may have had better knowledge of horses than did the artist at  ARN-074/A. The larger ARN-074/A horse may have been, therefore, painted following a first  or relatively unfamiliar sighting of the animal. The subsequent superimpositioning of the large  horse by an array of other motifs at this site also suggests that, with time, the original impact  of the animal as a novel encounter diminished. On the other hand, the ARN-087/1 horse-and- rider is both smaller in size and located in a more secluded position (where it could only be  seen by one person at a time). Given the above factors, the ARN-087/1 horse-and-rider figure  was arguably painted some time later than the ARN-074/A horse. The bullock with bell at  ARN-031/1 (Figure 9.13) also shows good anatomical details, indicating first-hand knowledge  of the animal; it was thus probably painted by someone who was already at least reasonably well  acquainted with the animal, and possibly by someone who had themselves worked with cattle.  If so, an early 20th-century age is suggested for its creation, an interpretation consistent with the  painting’s excellent state of preservation.  Each of the European-contact paintings of animals within Jawoyn lands has a very different  appearance. While these differences may reflect the artists’ diverse attitudes, the varying states  of preservation of the images coupled with the arguments made above suggest a progressive  development of Jawoyn observation from an initial high impact of the unknown, to greater  familiarity with the animals over time (Figure 9.27).  Figure 9.27 Proposed chronological sequence of introduced fauna (horse, cattle) motifs in Jawoyn  lands. A: Early. B: Intermediate. C: Late. Source: Robert Gunn. Following the depopulation of the plateau in 1942, it appears that little, if any, rock art was  produced in the Jawoyn lands of the Arnhem Land plateau, as use of rockshelters closer to  newly established settlements seem to have replaced the more distant art shelters (see also Arndt  1962:169–170). Evidence in the form of a range of portable artefacts (e.g. suitcase and cat’s-eye  marble; Figures 9.18 and 9.19) indicates that Jawoyn and other Aboriginal peoples crossing the  plateau probably continued to use rockshelters as camping places between 1910 and the closing  of the Maranboy tin mines in the early 1950s. While it is possible that a small amount of rock art  was produced in Jawoyn sites on the plateau during post-1940 crossings, no such images have yet  been identified (Smith 1994:233, 235). When Wamud Nadjamerrek walked over the Arnhem  Land plateau with his family in the 1930s, they camped at the spectacular rock art site of Nawarla  Gabarnmang (ARN-074/A). On his return visit in 2008, he remembered the well-decorated  ceiling and thought that there had been no additional rock art images added to the panels since  his earlier visit (Wamud Nadjamerrek, pers. comm. to Ray Whear 2008). As this is one of the  most decorated and, based on the size of the utilised floor space and density of surface cultural  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="30"> 192    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia materials, one of the most visited camping shelters on the plateau in Jawoyn lands, it is likely  that the shelter would have traces of any major recent period of rock art production occurring  on the plateau following Nadjamerrek’s visit. Consequently, an absence of any additional, recent  artwork at Nawarla Gabarnmang is consistent with the notion that rock art production did not  flourish on the plateau in Jawoyn lands in the period after 1930. Conclusion The Jawoyn lands of the Arnhem Land plateau were widely occupied during the early European- contact period, but effectively depopulated from the 1940s onwards. Here, rock art production  appears to have continued until around 1930 (Gunn et al. 2012a). Despite this, nowhere in  Jawoyn lands are paintings of European objects, people or events commonly found, and the few  that have been found occur close to the routes taken by Leichhardt and Lindsay. Arguably, all of  these European-contact motifs date to the early period of European contact (after 1845 AD) and,  hence, these paintings depict very early, perhaps even first-contact encounters. The implication  is that while Indigenous artists continued to paint on the plateau, it is not European themes that  directed their artistic attention, nor Europeans or other outsiders, but rather everyday concerns  that featured in established cosmologies that continued to guide how they viewed the world to  operate. The exception appears to have been the early contact period, a time that necessitated  the incorporation of foreigners into a pre-established world order. The key reference points for  artistic works continued to be ancestral connections articulating the Spirit-Beings and stories that  gave and continued to give shape to Country. Europeans had become a new presence, a powerful  one that began to change Indigenous lives, but they did not feature significantly in the existential  workings of the world, and so did not feature in the artworks that depicted those liminal spaces  between the materially embodied living and the numinous. It is later, with the dislocation of  people from the plateau during World War II, that the act of painting largely ceased, although  Jawoyn individuals and groups visiting places on the plateau after that time continued to relate to  places and ‘artworks’ as living presences of emplaced Spirit-Beings, sometimes deceased ancestors,  sometimes not, but always mediated by Dreaming cosmologies.
